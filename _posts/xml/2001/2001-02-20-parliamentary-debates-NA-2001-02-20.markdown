                          UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: In true Momberg fashion,
the hon Momberg referred today to one of the members of the DA as a
``bobbejaan''. [Laughter.]

Mr J H MOMBERG: Madam Speaker, it is not true. I called him a ``bobbejaan
spanner.'' I did not call him a ``bobbejaan''. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Mr Momberg, I trust that you would withdraw it
if you had said that.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, Mr Momberg sits there and, on regular
occasions, makes these silly kinds of statements. [Interjections.] I can
assure you, that he said: ``Sit down, you bobbejaan.'' He knows it, and he
knows that he is not telling the truth now.
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can we sort it out in my office afterwards, please?
[Interjections.]

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

       (a)  the perpetrators of the destruction;


       (b)  the problems encountered daily by commuters on trains;


       (c)  the chronic underinvestment in rail infrastructure, going back

       (a)  that the media in Zimbabwe is under siege;

           correspondent, Mercedes Sayagues, have been expelled from
           Zimbabwe;
       (c)  the recent attacks on Zimbabwe's judiciary, including threats

           opposition; and


       (d)  the continuation of South Africa's quiet diplomacy and
           constructive engagement, despite the extensive damage President

  (2) resolves that the current South African policy on Zimbabwe be
       reviewed and replaced with a more effective and results-orientated

[Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) compliments the Department of Public Service and Administration for
       transforming the salary administration system by -


       (a)  introducing stringent security measures in accessing the Persal
           system;

       (a)  the recognised need for South Africa to diversify its sources of

           operation; and


  (2) congratulates President Thabo Mbeki on his state visit to the Kingdom

[Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that, in spite of the moratorium, crime figures are leaking out,
           revealing an alarming increase in violent crimes in our country;
           and


       (b)  the figures for the greater Pretoria area alone show -


           (i)   an increase of 112% in housebreaking and robbery, and 53%
                  in armed robberies from 1999 to 2000; and


           (ii)  since the beginning of January, an increase in car
                  hijackings of 24%, compared with January 2000;


  (2) also notes that -
       (a)  the Government is placing the lives of South Africans in danger
           by not revealing crucial crime information; and


       (b)  the public can now question the Government's credibility,
           because this shocking crime increase has shown that the
           Government is trying to hide the true state of affairs; and


  (3) accordingly joins the Editors Forum in urging the Government to lift
       the crime statistics moratorium forthwith, and to deliver on its
       promises to combat crime if it wants to restore the public's trust in
       its ability.

Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with appreciation the establishment of a People's Bank at Mt
           Ayliff; and


       (b)  that this brings a much-needed service to the people of Mt
           Ayliff and Tabankulu that is long overdue;


  (2) expresses the hope that this service will bring to an end the erosion
       of pension payouts of the local people who, in the past, had to incur
       travelling expenses because they had to travel to either Mt Frere or
       Kokstad; and


  (3) encourages the establishment of similar services in Qumbu, Tsolo and
       other districts.

Mr A MLANGENI: Madam Speaker, because there are some parties here in this
House which aspire to call themselves ``liberation movements'', I hereby
give notice that on the next sitting day of the House I shall move on
behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the absurd notion of DP MP Francois Beukman that the DP is
       becoming a liberation party and that the ANC cannot lay sole claim to
       being a liberation party;


  (2) enquires from the DP where it was when South Africans needed to be
       liberated from the DA-apartheid regime; and


  (3) advises the DP that it can never be a liberation movement as long as
       it appoints only white males in senior positions in Cape Town,
       reimplements the Group Areas Act by banning soccer from being played
       in previously white areas, and has a policy of no free water to flats
       where blacks live.

[Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the ACDP's concern regarding the axing of top Unicity officials
       and that the ACDP does not support the position taken by the DA and
       the ANC;


  (2) acknowledges that officials are supposed to be apolitical and should
       not be intimidated by political interference;


  (3) acknowledges that the officials must ensure that they serve all the
       communities and not a particular political party's interest;


  (4) notes that it appears as though democracy is in reverse,  taking us
       ten steps back instead of taking the city forward; and


  (5) calls on the DA and ANC not to interfere with the appointment of
       officials, but rather to look at the qualifications and experience of
       the officer for the job.

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the FA:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that the ANC's lack of delivery has resulted in droves of ANC
       supporters protesting by staying away during last year's local
       government election;


  (2) further notes the fact that growing unemployment, poverty and crime
       has led to 48% of the urban black voters polled last year believing
       that things have got worse since 1994, and a further 20% believing
       that nothing has changed; and


  (3) also notes that the DA leadership has recommitted the DA to
       delivering in those local councils under its control, which will
       undoubtedly provide the much-desired future of hope, dignity, safety
       and opportunity ``for all the people'' and not only for a select few,
       as is experienced in most ANC-controlled local councils.

[Interjections.]

Mr H P CHAUKE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes reports that the Democratic Alliance has refused to grant
       permission for soccer to be played on the University of Stellenbosch
       sports field;


  (2) believes that this is part of a plan by the DA to confine soccer to
       historically disadvantaged areas and preserve well-equipped sports
       facilities for sporting codes for the white minority; and


  (3) calls on the DA to make sports facilities available for all sporting
       codes.

[Applause.]

Mr R S NTULI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with alarm the level of anger present in commuters in Pretoria
       which led to large-scale violence and lawlessness as well as the
       burning down of the Pretoria station;


  (2) believes that such conduct cannot be explained away in a democratic
       country; and


  (3) therefore calls upon the Government to appoint a commission of
       inquiry to establish -


       (a)  why the levels of anger were so high;


       (b)  whether there have been many previous interruptions of service
           to commuters; and


       (c)  what steps, in addition to criminal prosecution, are required to
           prevent a recurrence.

[Interjections.]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with appreciation the overall increase of 9% in the
       matriculation results for the year 2000;


  (2) acknowledges the fact that such positive results are the outcome of
       the dedication of learners, the hard work of teachers and the vision
       of the leadership of provincial Ministries and the national Minister;
       and


  (3) notes that the IFP therefore calls on the national Ministry to ensure
       that the rules governing the conduct of educators are tightened up in
       order that only quality and dedicated educators, committed to their
       learners, are retained within the service.

Mr R D PIETERSE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with alarm the decision of the DA in Cape Town to divide the
       city into 16 subcouncils;


  (2) recognises that this will further marginalise poor communities by
       depriving them of the ability to share in the revenue generated by
       wealthier communities;


  (3) believes that this is a tactical ploy by the DA to divide and rule
       Cape Town, and shows its disregard for its responsibilities to bring
       about harmony and equity between the different communities of the
       city; and


  (4) condemns this cynical strategy of the DA to protect the privileges of
       the affluent few at the expense of the disadvantaged many, which
       gives the lie to its claim of standing for all the people.

[Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the International Monetary Fund estimates that 8% of highly
           educated South Africans emigrate;


       (b)  a US credit rating agency believes that 16% of South Africans
           with tertiary education live abroad; and


       (c)  a 1999 Economist survey found that the likelihood of SA
           professionals emigrating was among the highest in the world; and


  (2) urges the Government to acknowledge the valuable skills of
       entrepreneurs and highly skilled workers in the South African economy
       by introducing tax incentives in the Budget that will make it
       worthwhile for them to apply their knowledge in their own country.

Mr C T FROLICK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock and dismay the news of a fire that has gutted
       Pretoria station;


  (2) acknowledges that this historic building is a vital component in the
       transport infrastructure of the Gauteng region, and that its
       destruction has directly led to major problems and inconvenience for
       hundreds of thousands of commuters;


  (3) further notes that infrastructure development is one of the issues
       raised by the hon the President in his state of the nation address;


  (4) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the reported involvement
       of irate commuters in starting this fire; and


  (5) affirms its commitment to responsible citizenship in the knowledge
       that, in a democracy, lawlessness by a small group of people must
       never be allowed to disrupt the lives of a whole community.

Ms E GANDHI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the valiant efforts by the students, parents, educators and
           community of Mangosuthu Technikon in KwaZulu-Natal to bring
           about stability and establish normal functioning on this campus;


       (b)  that Adv Gaum of the Democratic Alliance and Mr Burrows chose to
           march to the campus to urge a select minority of disgruntled
           staff to step up their illegal strike; and


       (c)  that these honourable members disregarded community structures
           and the legal institutions on campus, and chose to encourage an
           illegal strike by a minority group of workers; and


  (2) calls on the DA to appropriately chastise such irresponsible
       behaviour by these members.

[Applause.]

                       HORROR CRASH NEAR INGENI FOREST

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House, noting the horror crash near Ingeni Forest in Southern
  KwaZulu-Natal involving a minibus and a truck and which left seventeen
  people dead, wishes to express condolences to the family members and the
  relatives of the deceased.

Agreed to.

                                    TOUR

  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the South African cricket players on their inclusion in
       the national team for the West Indies tour;


  (2) notes that this team is a worthy ambassador for South Africa and that
       it has reached new heights under the capable leadership of captain
       Shaun Pollock;

       of the West Indies.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move the draft
resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:

       THE STRUGGLE CONCERNING TRADITIONAL LEADERS IS A POLITICAL AND
                CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE RESOLVED

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and the honourable House, the struggle
concerning traditional leaders is a political and constitutional issue that
has to be resolved.
Re tlile fano go tla go bua ka maaparankwe, batho ba go bonalang demokerasi
e ba ntsha ka loso logolo ka ntlha ya lotso lwa bona.

Motho o gopola Raditladi fa a ne a re:


  Kgosi le merero ga a mo rerise. Ditshwanelo tsa gagwe ga a di bone, di
  bonwa ke bo tshikinya-dirope, 'khutsana tse dikgolo

Motswasele o ne a bua jaana fa a lemoga fa a sa kaiwe ka sepe mo gagaabo.

Dikgosi tsa rona di iphitlhela di le mo maemong a a ntseng jalo mo
malatsing a. Bathati ga ba di kae ka sepe. (Translation of Setswana
paragraphs follows.)

[We are here to talk about the royal household, the people who are being
singled out by democracy because of their social status.

One remembers Raditladi when he said:


  The chief is not even being informed. His rights are not recognised. They
  are given to the wrong people.

Motswasele said this when he realised that he was being taken for granted
in his homestead.

Our chiefs find themselves in those kinds of situations, these days. The
authorities do not recognise them.]

In precolonial times the inhabitants of Africa had a system of government
that catered for the needs of all communities. Central to it was the
institution of traditional leadership in which customs, traditions and
cultural practices formed the basis of the legal system that regulated the
lives of the people.

Throughout the African continent, traditional leaders have reasserted and
maintained their influence in a range of countries that attempted to limit
their role. These include Ghana, the Niger Republic, the Ivory Coast,
Senegal, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Zambia and Tanzania.

The position of traditional leaders in South Africa, whom we prefer to
refer to as the dikgosi, amakhosi, dikhosi and marena, has become
vulnerable since the advent of the new order. This order came out with the
position that every square centimetre of this country would be governed by
elected people. Obviously, this statement means that dikgosi will cease to
exist. We urge all who know and accept the power and role of dikgosi to
resist the benign obliteration of these traditional institutions.

It has come as no surprise that even the authors of the new Constitution
had little or nothing to write about the traditional institutions. It goes
without saying that the principle was still to have elected people to
govern every nook and cranny of this country. All that has proved to be
wishful thinking.

We call on all dikgosi to stand up, speak out and take risks if needs be to
protect their turf. They should not be docile and sit back, as their real
being is being eroded. They should not sit back and take delight in being
appointed directors to some board of some parastatal.

In some provinces, even in this era, amakhosi are told by the powers that
be not to take part in political activities. This, despite their
constitutional rights of freedom of association and their political rights.
We congratulate those leaders who have stood their ground and have graced
the portals of corridors of legislative institutions in our country.

In our pursuit of realising the African Renaissance in the African century
we can succeed if we do not cast off the African culture and traditions, as
dictated to us by sections 30, 31 and 185 of the Constitution of the
Republic. These sections deal with participation in and promotion of the
culture of communities.

While we hail the thinking behind the establishment of provincial and
national councils of traditional leaders, we argue that issues and
developments are at the local level. Regional or district councils of
traditional leaders, as the old regional authorities, are an imperative.
Such councils will allow amakhosi in the regions to remain in touch and
abreast of developments in their districts, as well as at provincial level
where they will meet the aggregate of all issues in the province.

The Local Government: Municipal Structures Act of 1998 has been found
wanting in its attempts to address the fears of dikgosi, hence the endless
amendments which even saw Parliament going into recess without the usual
fanfare of members bidding one another goodbye last year. The amending Bill
was rejected because, firstly, it did not address issues of powers and
functions of dikgosi, and secondly, the delegation clause was insufficient
as it was not a guarantee in law and left the discretion to politicians to
determine the role of the amakhosi. That is exactly what the colonial
government did. The third point is that dikgosi feel that only the
amendment of the Constitution will help clarify their status and role.

May we advise that the failure to appreciate and accommodate the
traditional culture and practices could precipitate a major crisis and
impede the ongoing constitutional development process. It is surprising
that while it is widely accepted that dikgosi and their councils render an
important service, a distinctive characteristic of the constitutional
debate is the political and constitutional concepts that disregard crucial
elements of the African reality.

The Minister for Provincial and Local Government, the hon Mufamadi, has
repeatedly asserted that traditional authorities will not become another
sphere of government. According to him the existing local government model
will be preserved and protected, as will the institution of traditional
leaders. In the same breath, some traditional leaders have to sit on the
local councils as ex officio members, with no voting rights on issues that
will affect their villages. All they need to do, perhaps, is to lobby, in a
subtle manner, lest they be seen to be partisan.

Schedule 4 of the Constitution of the Republic lists indigenous law,
customary law and traditional leadership as functional areas of concurrent
national and provincial legislative competence. In each case the
Constitution states that such competence is subject to Chapter 12. This is
one of the shortest chapters in the Constitution, comprising only sections
211 and 212. Notwithstanding what is contained in Schedule 4, in sections
211 and 212 of the Constitution, the magosi find that their role has been
reduced to ceremonial duties.

The Constitution does recognise them, but does not define their functions.
The institution of traditional leadership has been downgraded and
subjugated to elected municipalities. It is incumbent upon this honourable
House to come up with legislation that will go down well with the dikgosi
and their followers.

Schedule 6 of the 1993 interim Constitution compels the President to assign
to the provinces all old-order legislation that pertains to traditional
leadership. While we have a new Constitution, there is no legislation that
has to go the whole hog with the Constitution.

The remuneration of traditional leaders has remained a bone of contention.
As indicated above, some old-order legislation has been assigned in
accordance with the interim Constitution, and the remuneration of
incumbents is still subject to laws of the various former homelands and
erstwhile independent states. It is a situation that needs to be attended
to urgently.

To enhance the image and status of amakhosi, elected members should not see
them as less important and not deserving of any respect. Those in control
should desist from manipulating traditional leaders to achieve
constitutional and political goals. Traditional leaders are to be seen to
be representing their communities, and not to be Government mouthpieces.
The institution of traditional leadership is rooted in the soil of Africa,
and in the hearts and minds of all ordinary Africans who take pride in
their history, culture, origin and identity. We appeal to all in positions
of authority, be it in committees or legislatures, to ensure that whoever
chairs a structure that will deal with traditional leaders, should be
someone of African decent who fully understands the situation. It should
not just be one of the members of the organisation.

The general notion that traditional authorities are stagnant institutions
incapable of accommodating social and political change, should be
countered. Any endeavour to create a fully democratic society in South
Africa must utilise the intrinsic strengths of traditional leaders.
Traditional leaders and authorities are essential political, social and
economic structures for maintaining the sociopolitical order that is a
prerequisite for rural development.

Finally, constitutional avenues have to be explored urgently to enable
traditional leaders to continue to exercise administrative, executive and
even quasi-judicial powers on a delegated basis. We are aware that much of
the relative institutional stability experienced in the deep rural areas
can be attributed to the influence of dikgosi. This natural relationship
between dikgosi and their followers should not be unduly encroached upon by
the politisation of issues.

Mr J M NGUBENI: Madam Speaker, hon members, the colonisation of the African
continent changed and distorted the way of living through the violent
acquisition of land with the primary aim of using the traditional
institutions to control, divide, repress and rule the African communities.

The institution of traditional leaders during precolonial times exercised
the legislative, judicial and administrative powers that even extended to
the allocation of land. In South Africa, the majority of traditional
leaders were co-opted and corrupted by the colonial forces and the
apartheid state. This process had an immense, disruptive impact on the
social form and organisation of African communities. Many traditional
leaders were deposed and substituted by illegitimate leaders, and this
poses a major challenge to the institution itself.

An audit to ascertain the authenticity of traditional leaders will enable
the deposed leaders to be reinstated and will also accelerate
transformation, so as to achieve full legitimacy, democracy, respect and
acceptance by all communities. Unfortunately, nothing can be learned from
the UCDP because during their reign in the so-called Bophuthatswana they
deposed legitimate chiefs, replaced them with stooges and looted the
coffers of tribal funds. [Applause.] The UCDP must therefore shut up, as we
are cleaning up their mess.

The ANC-led Government has a broad mandate to further implement the
programme of a democratic constitutional state and a Bill of Rights founded
on the principles of freedom, equality, nonracialism and nonsexism. This
poses a complex scenario which dictates patience and sensitivity to the
following issues. Firstly, the conflicts between customary law and the Bill
of Rights regarding the status of women must be resolved. Secondly, how do
traditional leaders fit within a system of elected public representatives
in all spheres of government? Thirdly, traditional leaders cannot be
deprived of participating in politics. But how do they maintain neutrality
within their communities and discharge their duties fairly in customary
courts, land allocation and so forth? What about their subjects who support
opposing political parties? Fourthly, the communal land tenure system must
also be reformed to empower rural communities by legally recognising their
rights as land users. Local government must also have access to land for
rural development, attraction of investment, job creation and its necessary
regulatory and planning role.

These issues clearly demonstrate the sensitivity and complexity of these
matters. It is therefore important to approach this matter as a process,
not as an event. It is also argued that the approach to the institution of
traditional leadership is more or less influenced by the Western democratic
tendencies. A holistic approach is necessary to resolve this matter, to
enhance the ongoing constitutional and rural development. A selective
approach which focuses on powers and duties only will lead to other
problems, leaving us with unresolved issues. The White Paper process, which
is the broad consultative process, contains all these questions.

Maybe a comparative analysis of other African countries will shed light on
the powers and functions of traditional leaders. There are important
lessons which can be learnt about the role of traditional leaders in
neighbouring countries - Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe. Both in Namibia
and Zimbabwe traditional leaders played an important role in implementing
the oppressive policies of the previous regimes, and consequently after
independence their administrative functions were mostly transferred to
elected local governments.

In Namibia they still operate fairly autonomously from the elected state
structures. Their role is also to administer and execute the customary law
of that community, as well as to assist the police and other law-
enforcement agencies. In Botswana traditional leaders do not participate in
politics and have been assigned administrative and developmental roles.
However, the institution of traditional leadership plays a significant role
in customary courts on civil matters and has somewhat limited criminal
jurisdiction.

In all these neighbouring states the institution of traditional leaders
coexists with elected structures, and there is not a single country in
Africa where the institution is a sphere or tier of government. This is an
important lesson. We should not expose traditional leaders to the turmoil
of political upheavals. Public representatives can be booted out of office,
but what about traditional leaders? [Interjections.]

As we develop our evolving infant democracy, we need to strive for an
institution which responds and adapts to change, and is in harmony with the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Any endeavour to create a fully
democratic society must utilise the intrinsic strength of traditional
leaders. I further argue that a holistic and inclusive process will provide
a lasting solution with regard to this matter.

This matter has received significant attention from the Portfolio Committee
on Provincial and Local Government. During the Budget Review process many
contentious issues were discussed. In May last year public hearings were
held on the discussion document on traditional leaders. More public
hearings were held on the Local Governments Municipal Structures Second
Amendment Bill towards the end of last year, in which 17 organs of civil
society participated.

What is striking is that all the participants, excluding the coalition of
traditional leaders, rejected outright the amendment on points of
procedure, content and constitutionality. This again demonstrates that this
matter is too sensitive to be fast-tracked.

Contained in the official report from the House of Traditional Leaders
submitted to Parliament, is the statement that the DP said that they were
not interested in traditional matters. That is official, but today I am
surprised by their participation in this debate. I am wondering whether it
is genuine or an instance of political opportunism.

In conclusion, what is critical is co-operative governance at local level,
with traditional leaders having representation and playing a role to
develop communities, fight poverty and create jobs. [Applause.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker, hon members, I quote from The Citizen, dated
13 February 2001:


  ``Negotiations are continuing on proposed legislation to give powers and
  authority to traditional leaders,'' said Provincial and Local Government
  Minister Sydney Mufamadi.

How many times have similar words been spoken, promised action which never
takes place! [Interjections.] Allow me to remind members of the many steps
along the way which got traditional leaders precisely nowhere. In 1994
Nelson Mandela promised international mediation to address their concerns.
That promise has never been honoured. In 1996 the ANC made a commitment to
King Goodwill Zwelithini and other traditional leaders that their powers
would be formalised through the Constitution. That promise, also, has not
yet been fulfilled.

In 1997 the then Deputy President, Thabo Mbeki, met with traditional
leaders in Durban and assured them that the ANC and Government would attend
to their concerns - another promise still awaiting fulfilment. In 1998 the
then Department of Constitutional Development announced that it was
preparing a White Paper on the role of traditional leaders in municipal
government. They said that the paper would be tabled in 1999; again this
did not happen. In 1998 the same department announced that it had begun an
audit of traditional leaders in the institutions. Three years down the line
this audit has not yet been completed.

Almost a year ago the Department of Provincial and Local Government
released what it called the draft discussion document towards a White Paper
on traditional leadership. This document is draft by name, and daft by
nature. [Interjections.] This means that we have a draft, and then we will
have a discussion document, which will eventually be followed by a White
Paper, which will probably come in a frantic rush before the elections in
2004. This draft document only highlights the anomalies and problems
associated with integrating the institutions of traditional leaders into a
democratic system. It offers no solutions or proposals.

After many meetings before the elections in December, and yet another
promise to amend the Local Government Municipal Structures Act, everything
once again ground to a halt with more promises to take it up in the new
year. The portfolio committee was supposed to meet in January, but
obviously the urgency has decreased since the holding of the election and
it is only now before Cabinet, yet again.

The ANC stands accused of manipulating traditional communities to exploit
their votes, but lets them down as soon as the election is over.
[Interjections.] The DA deplores this devious action. This is what we have
from the ANC Government after nearly seven years - promises, delays and
stalling.

Research indicates that some 13,2 million people fall under the aegis of
traditional leaders. That is one out of every three South Africans whose
daily lives are affected by all the indecision and procrastination. This
lack of progress is an indictment on the ANC's dithering commitment to
democratic governance. It exposes a clear lack of political will to deal
with this important issue. [Interjections.]

In today's Business Day, the chairman of the Congress of Traditional
Leaders of South Africa, Patekile Holomisa, was quoted as saying yesterday
that traditional leaders felt deeply disappointed that Government is taking
them for a ride. That is not good enough. The DA believes that it is time
for the Government and the ANC to show the political will to deal with this
issue decisively and finally for the good of all South Africans.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Inkosi M W HLENGWA: Madam Speaker and hon members of the National Assembly,
I rise to make a contribution to the subject under discussion, which has
now become a sore point for traditional authorities and rural communities.

It is a sore point because up to now no solution has been found in spite of
traditional leaders themselves having put forward what could be a simple
and effective solution to resolve the question of their role, powers and
functions in local government matters. Therefore I must commend the tabling
of this motion. The IFP hopes that all parties will endorse its
significance.

The people of South Africa celebrated our victory when we freed ourselves
from the chains of oppression but, ironically, the elected representatives
now seem to be dragging their feet when it comes to the question of
addressing the very roots of the indigenous system of government. The
struggle for the retention of political and administrative powers has been
waged by the indigenous inhabitants of our country under the leadership of
indigenous rulers. Now this struggle continues.

The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa recognises traditional
leadership and yet, unwittingly, falls short when it comes to the aspect of
local government. As it now stands the Constitution will necessarily do
that which the President has committed himself to preventing, which is that
the powers and functions of traditional authorities will be eradicated or
diminished. [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: [Inaudible.]

Inkosi M W HLENGWA: By you.

Against this background, traditional authorities have proposed an amendment
to Chapter 12 of the Constitution to allow traditional authorities to
function as a local government structure. This will allow traditional
leaders to retain their role, powers and functions in their respective
areas of jurisdiction without isolating elected representatives. In fact,
this solution will enhance the image of a two-tiered structure.

The IFP has repeatedly called for the resolution of this matter, and
therefore I choose to be brief today. It is unfortunate that geographic
Africans may not see the seriousness of this issue in the same light as
those who are truly cultural Africans. April 27 1994 only completed one
phase of the struggle for total emancipation. We need to realise and accept
that there are outstanding phases which include the cultural liberation of
Africa and her indigenous systems of governance. [Interjections.]

Leliya lungu elihloniphekile likhulumisa okukamama walo. [That hon member
speaks like his/her mother.]

This is a struggle about the essence of being African and about the
rediscovery of the soul of Africa. Those who tend to forget who they are
must please break free of the chains which still colonise their minds and
start thinking about the restoration of Africa. We must stick to our
Africanness, and never regard ourselves as a satellite of any European
power or a little European island in the midst of an African ocean.

Finally, we thank the President for not removing the issue of traditional
leaders from the table, but we urge him to expedite the process of seeking
a solution. Traditional leadership is one African institution that clearly
defines who we are and that defied all foreign-inspired attempts to destroy
Africa. We salute all those who will continue to stand with us as we try to
find the political and cultural path back to our home, Africa. [Applause.]

Mr F BEUKMAN: Madam Speaker, the debate on the role of traditional leaders
cannot take place without a proper analysis of the constitutional
provisions with regard to the subject. Chapter 12 of the Constitution, with
special reference to section 211(1), is relevant in this regard:


  The institution, status and role of traditional leadership, according to
  customary law, are recognised, subject to the Constitution.

The Bill of Rights, the Founding Provisions of the Constitution, and
Chapter 9 on State Institutions Supporting Constitutional Democracy, should
be read together with Chapter 12.

The mere fact that this debate is taking place today is a clear indication
that the Government's current handling of the issue of traditional leaders
is in serious dispute, to say the least.

It is apparent that traditional leaders are actually saying that the
Government did not implement section 212(1) and 212(2) properly, or that it
does not have the necessary political will to implement these provisions.
Although the national House of Traditional Leaders and the various
provincial houses were established, there is a general feeling of
discontentment among the traditional leaders and their support base.

A further stumbling block with regard to the process is the long-awaited
White Paper on traditional leaders, as referred to earlier in the debate.
It is difficult to see how the issue of the role of traditional leaders
could be properly debated and analysed without having reference to a well-
canvassed White Paper. Inkosi Patekile Holomisa, an ANC member of this
House, wrote 2 years ago in the Business Day of 11 June 1999:


  In its first term of office, the ANC unsuccessfully skirted the issue of
  what constitutional role to award African royalty in the governance of
  the country. This lack of political direction and leadership both annoyed
  traditional leaders and hampered rural development and service delivery.
It is already clear that in the second term of the ANC's governance, it
will not be any different. Promises were made by Government that a revised
Local Government Municipal Structures Amendment Bill would be considered by
the relevant portfolio committee and Parliament on January 29 this year.
This never materialised.

According to a press report in Business Day of 12 December 2000, the Deputy
President, Mr Zuma, indicated that the said legislation should be passed by
Parliament by February 2001. It is now quite clear that this is not going
to happen.

The DA believes that it is not conducive to the development of the
constitutional state that the executive does not live up to its promises,
especially when it is dealing with a sensitive issue regarding the position
of traditional communities. Legal certainty is not promoted if timeframes
are not adhered to.

Die rol van die parlementêre portefeuljekomitee word ook verswak, indien
die geskeduleerde program van werksaamhede en beoogde wetgewing, weens
bepaalde politieke doelwitte van die uitvoerende gesag, in gedrang gebring
word. [The role of the parliamentary portfolio committee is also weakened
if the scheduled programme of activities and envisaged legislation is
jeopardised as a result of specific political objectives of the executive.]

Another constitutional mechanism which, it is envisaged, will impact on the
role of traditional leaders is the Commission for the Promotion and
Protection of the Rights of Cultural Religious and Linguistic Communities.
It is assumed, without reference to specifics, that cultural or other
councils, or councils for the community, could also be relevant to the role
of traditional leadership.

The problem is, however, that the process to establish the commission in
the public mind has vanished from the executive's agenda. The uncertainty
about progress with the implementation of the commission also contributes
to a perception that the executive is not committed to promoting the agenda
of the said communities. The current impasse also impacts on the ability of
traditional communities to establish cultural or other councils. The
dragging of feet by the executive on this matter is detrimental to the
functioning of civil society in general. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
Chief N Z MTIRARA: Deputy Speaker, hon members, since the historical event
of 1994, traditional leaders or amakhosi have gone to great lengths, in
good faith, to engage the Government in discussions and deliberations
regarding what the new era heralds for South Africa and its people. Most of
these interactions have not been in the public eye, because of the
fragility of the transitional period.

Ubukhosi, or hereditary leadership, and the new South African Government
are engaged in serious discussions in an effort to resolve issues
concerning the direction and shape of the new South Africa in relation to a
review and re-evaluation of its institutions. The issue of traditional
leadership, which was nearly obliterated under colonialism, and was subject
to corruption under apartheid, is of paramount importance.

The majority of African people under amakhosi jurisdiction, if not all,
demand that their voices be heard through their hereditary leaders.
Amakhosi do not believe that this cannot be accommodated in a democratic
South Africa; hence they continue to engage the Government in deliberations
on this crucial issue.

Amakhosi believe in an evolutionary process, as opposed to imposing foreign
values on them. One has only to trace the history of colonialism and
apartheid to observe that change is always destructive if it is imposed on
people. The central issue here is to reconcile our traditional structures
that resisted obliteration and the demands of the new world order. We must
not seek to obliterate the former, nor attempt to avoid the challenges of
the latter.

As responsible and well-intentioned patriots, both inside and outside the
Government, we should seriously ask ourselves whether South Africa, at this
delicate stage of transformation, can afford divisiveness over this crucial
issue of hereditary leadership. Many, if not all, of our country's amakhosi
have taken the view that the introduction of the new municipalities, with
elected councillors, will result in the complete obliteration of their
functions and powers. They fear that they will be transformed into nothing
more than a ceremonial institution.

I want to make so bold as to state that this part of planet earth on which
South Africa is situated is an inheritance where God Almighty, in His
wisdom and under His guidance, has placed our people under hereditary
leadership. Without defying and denying the evolutionary process or the
dynamics of human society, I want to draw the attention of those who keep
on harping on far-off examples of historic monarchs overthrown by their
people or events closer to home and events that are hurtful.

Nkumah, in his zeal to transform Ghanaian society, stepped on the toes of
the Ashanti traditional leadership. What happened to him? He died in exile.
Obote stepped on the toes of the kingdom of Buganda. What happened to him?
He is wandering in exile. Mengistu Haile Miriam, in his zeal to destroy
everything to do with traditional leadership, hounded Emperor Haile
Selassie to death. What happened to him? He is wandering in exile with few
countries wanting to touch him with a ten-foot pole.

Kungoko ndisithi natsha nikhaba imviko nje. [That is why I say, if you do
not listen, you will get hurt.] [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, traditional governance and institutions are
real and active in South Africa. Thousands of people are happily the
subjects of this type of governance. These people are happy under these
institutions not because of ignorance, but by choice.

When we despise traditional leadership, we are inadvertently saying that
Africans would not have been able to govern themselves had colonialism not
happened. Europeans, on the other hand, have retained their traditional
values in some parts. For example, the Netherlands is still a monarchy.
These country have successfully married liberal democracy with traditional
governance. What is tragic about the assault on traditional institutions in
South Africa, is that it is the African leaders themselves, not their
people, who are intolerant of the system.

The ACDP unequivocally lends its support to the preservation of traditional
governance in coexistence with liberal democracy. We believe that
traditional institutions and customs, in so far as they are not repugnant
to Christian principles, are good and will help to retain our values. The
benefits of traditional governance far outweigh any concerns about the
potential abuse of human rights. Abuse of human rights is not inherent in
this type of governance, but, like other types of governance, it is caused
by distortion and authoritarianism. Therefore, we cannot throw the baby out
with the bath water. We must improve the system and make it work.

Lastly, I would like to pose a challenge to the chiefs themselves to rid
themselves of statutory chiefs. Secondly, I would like to hear from them
whether they would be willing to abandon party politics when their house is
in order. The involvement of chiefs in active chieftainship and active
party politics simultaneously is one of the major reasons that has
compromised the legitimacy of the institution.

Mr J J KGARIMETSA: Madam Speaker, hon members of Parliament, the Minister
has repeatedly said that the issue of traditional leaders is no longer
dealt with in terms of whether the institution has to exist or not, but how
it should exist side by side with a democratically elected institution.

The task at hand is being dealt with at the right time as the country is
engaged in transforming the local sphere of government. Colleagues will
outline the progress made by the ANC Government around the issues at hand,
with regard to the institution of traditional leadership.

Without going much into the history of the ANC and its handling of the
issue of traditional leadership and its institutions, I would like to
remind the House that the ANC always had the issue of traditional leaders
on its agenda during the liberation struggle and up to now. The issue has
not been about doing away with the traditional institutions. Rather, the
ANC has constantly argued that these institutions are part of our culture
and tradition. [Applause.] We recognise that they need to adjust to the
democratisation of governments, not only in South Africa but the world
over. [Laughter.]

We need to remember that the policies of successive colonial, apartheid and
homeland governments completely distorted the institution of traditional
leadership, co-opted it and assigned to it roles which were alien to it.
Through a complex web of pieces of legislation, the institution was
transformed into a tool with which the cultural differences of the black
people were emphasised and used as the basis for Balkanising the country.

Now that we are in a democratic South Africa, which was brought about by
the ANC, we have the opportunity to map out a vision which will harmonise
the indigenous institutions of traditional leadership with our evolving
system of democratic governance. Once we have mapped out our vision we must
ensure that it is supported by policies and programmes. The mapping out of
this vision, and the articulation of policies and programmes, is not the
sole province of the Government. The rest of society must contribute to
this process.

The type of transformation the ANC Government is pursuing is in the context
of co-operative government, in terms of Chapter 3 of the Constitution. The
main programme of the ANC Government is to reconstruct and develop our
communities, and these are mainly African communities where traditional
leaders and their institutions are located. It follows that the role of
traditional leaders as representatives of communities is development.

The ANC continues to salute and recognise the role of traditional leaders
in the development of local areas and communities that include community
participation in decision-making and contributing to development costs. All
citizens of South Africa, black and white, are urged by the ANC-led
Government to move away from the past and create an environment at national
and global level alike, which is conducive to development and the
elimination of poverty.

However, there is a need to detail the actual functions and powers of
traditional leaders in relation to their role of development, as they
coexist side by side with the democratically elected public
representatives. We know and we are convinced that functions and powers
could be easily separated or shared. The sharing of powers and functions
could be made easier if traditional leaders ceased to be politicians.

Setswana paragraphs follows.)

[Let us admit that up to this stage, the ANC has done a lot for us. The
stage that I am referring to, is that of a democratic government. Let the
chiefs admit that the respect that is being revived by the ANC-led
Government, is not really intended to belittle them, but to honour them
because where they come from deserves recognition.

They were exploited by the apartheid governments, denying them the value of
their natural veneration. I heard the hon member Mfundisi from the North
West province, saying that democracy has done away with the chiefs. It did
not do away with them, it is just that they do not understand. An example
is the North West, where there are very greedy chiefs who do this and that.
He becomes a chief, then a community leader, and finds it difficult to
differentiate between the chief and the community when he is engaged in
political affairs.

It is very unfortunate for us as the ANC, to realise that our chiefs do not
acknowledge that their honour that they had lost, that was taken away from
them by the apartheid governments, is being restored. Chieftaincy is not
something that one can just desire to have. What we are saying, is that our
chiefs should not attempt to kill two birds with one stone. Let chiefs be
chiefs who delight in serving their communities and working hand in hand
with their local governments to change the people's lives. If he is in
politics, where does he leave the community? If he wants to be in politics,
he must leave community affairs.]

Gen C L VILJOEN: Madam Speaker, many of us, including myself, claim to be
Africans. We are devoted to this continent, and we are prepared to work and
plan for the development of our country. But if we preach Africa, we must
also practise Africa, as it is. For in Africa, and also here in South
Africa, the institution of traditional leaders is alive and well, and is a
well-established reality.

It is not something that we can wish away. It is a traditional way of
community government, furthering, for example the maintenance of customs
and values, the maintenance of community structures, the maintenance of
community discipline, the maintenance of a sense of togetherness that can
be harnessed for any purpose within the community. The whole of Africa
consists, therefore, of many minority communities, sharing one living space
in a greater pluralistic society. This is the legacy of decolonisation as
it affects all of us, but it is a reality in Africa and we cannot wish it
away.

So in Africa we need a tailor-made democracy. We need a unique democracy in
line with the principles of democracy, but catering for a consocietal
arrangement of ethnic groups, nationalities and communities bound together
by a bigger nation and a common patriotism to that nation. The FF supports
the motion, and we say that we should therefore resolve this issue and get
on with the job and stop doing nothing, because we have a need in Africa
for a way of giving due constitutional recognition to the concept of
community autonomy within the bigger democratic state. That will bring
about a conflict-free South Africa and stability.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, the PAC thanks the UCDP for introducing a
motion on traditional leaders, bringing about this debate. I want to
preface my remarks in the short time at my disposal by saying that as an
African nation which was under colonialism for over 300 years, and mentally
captured, we cannot go forward until we are singularly aware of who we are,
where we have come from and where we are going.

Before we jump on the passing trains of others, we must make sure that we
are rooted in afrocentricity and not in eurocentric brainwashing. If we
fail to do this, we shall never find our African identity. We hear much
today about democracy and good governance from the originators of the
transatlantic slave trade in human cargo and colonialism in which African
lands were stolen and their institutions overthrown. [Interjections.]

It is a shame for this country that homosexuals and abortionists have their
rights well defined, yet here we are in this Parliament today, still
debating the struggle concerning traditional leaders. Of course, it is true
that the very purported recognition of authentic traditional leaders in the
Constitution is woolly. Sections 211 and 212 of this Constitution are
couched in very vague legal language.

This House must decide whether it also wants to recognise African royalty
or only European monarchs who often come here and are pampered. If there is
a problem regarding this recognition, let us go further afield and study
this problem in countries such as Uganda, Ghana and Malaysia.

by a passing fancy.]

Mr R S NTULI: Madam Speaker, hon Minister and hon members, after six years
in power, the ANC has done little to resolve the problem, the status, the
role and the function of traditional leaders, despite the fact that this
vexing issue was one of the critical issues during the Codesa negotiations
in the early 1990s. [Interjections.]

The Government produced a draft discussion document towards a White Paper
on traditional leadership and institutions, largely because of the imminent
local government elections scheduled for 5 December 2000. Yet even this
draft document failed to confront head-on the issue of what powers
traditional leaders should have and an insulting amendment soon appeared
which diminished traditional leaders' authority to the overseeing of
unimportant matters such as management of natural resources. It is not
surprising that the traditional leaders rejected it outright.

Traditional leaders argue that municipal powers and functions which were
recently bestowed on the elected municipal councils will erode their
control over land and their role in dispensing justice in their areas.
These perceptions certainly do not promote stability and peace in their
areas. Equally distressing and alarming is the callous socioeconomic
environment and this certainly arises from the Government's failure to face
head-on this political challenge.

It is a fact that the policies of the successive colonial, apartheid and
homeland governments completely distorted the institution of traditional
leadership by co-opting it and assigning it roles that were foreign to it.
After six years in government - these traditional lands being the major
segment of the rural underdeveloped areas - the ANC Government has not put
in place any integrated development programme, despite the fact that
approximately 13 million South Africans live in these areas. The result of
this negligence is that our citizens in these areas suffer the plagues that
affect this country with greater magnitude than urban dwellers.

Public health services in these areas are very poor, if any. Where they are
available, there is a scarcity of medicine and an inadequate supply of
nurses and doctors. The scourge of HIV/Aids is paralysing these
communities. Lack of clean water makes these people an easy target for
cholera, something we all know. The infrastructure in areas like
communication and education is deplorable. The school buildings in many
cases are not conducive to proper learning and teaching materials are
chronically inadequate.

The DP accepts that there is a significant role for traditional leadership.
They cannot simply be wished away. What is needed is to devise a settlement
which recognises their role and some of their functions, but operating
within the constitutional parameters. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the concept of democracy is engineered by
the people's voice to regulate societal coexistence. Therefore, traditional
authority structures must be rejuvenated to promote the tribal culture at
the social, spiritual and economic level.

The reality is that the South African Constitution is designed to establish
a nonracial and nonsexist democracy. However, traditional authority is
fundamentally patriarchal and lacks sufficient female representation. It is
difficult for traditional leaders to operate in a new political
dispensation. South Africa is not a monarchy, but a democratic country. To
appreciate traditional leadership, there is a need for traditional leaders
to redefine and reconstruct their roles in the contemporary democratic
South Africa. Specifically, proper representation for women must feature in
all structures of traditional authorities, that is, at national, provincial
and local level.

The MF champions the idea that to resolve this issue, significant efforts
must be made to ensure that traditional leaders grasp the realistic concept
of our political system, civil society, governance, community development,
constitutional rights, change and development, local government
administration and management, traditional leadership and law. The
integration of customary practice, democratic values, indigenous knowledge
and leadership management will correctly empower traditional authorities to
fulfil their dual role of protecting the traditional way of life and,
simultaneously, developing the rural population. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, in die eerste plek, hartlik geluk aan die
UCDP met hierdie debatstema, maar veral ook met die wyse waarop hulle dit
geformuleer het. Ek wil konsentreer op die een deel van die tema, naamlik
die kwessie van tradisionele leiers, wat nie net polities, maar ook
konstitusioneel aangespreek word.

Ek maak die stelling, dat die Grondwet van Suid-Afrika nog ver tekort skiet
om hoegenaamd die kompleksiteit van 'n diep, plurale gemeenskap te
verdiskonteer. Hiervan is die regte van tradisionele leiers en gemeenskappe
'n sprekende voorbeeld. Die krisis wat in hierdie verband voor die
plaaslike verkiesing ontstaan het, is 'n duidelike bewys daarvan.

Hierdie konstitusionele gebrek kan teruggevoer word na 'n onvoltooide
proses en 'n onvervulde belofte, naamlik die belofte van internasionale
bemiddeling, juis rondom hierdie aangeleenthede. Voorts is daar ook 'n
reeks onvervulde beloftes daarna. Hierdie onvoltooide hoofstuk sal
konstitusioneel aangespreek moet word. Artikel 211 erken die status en die
rol van tradisionele leiers, maar,``subject to the Constitution''. Voorts
erken dit gewoontereg binne hierdie gemeenskappe; maar ook ``subject to the
Constitution''. Die funksionering van tradisionele leiers word ook erken,
maar, weer eens onderworpe aan die Grondwet.

Die Grondwet waaraan hulle egter onderwerp word, is deur en deur 'n
grondwet wat oorheers word deur die klem op individuele regte. Gevolglik is
ook die instellings waarna in artikel 212 verwys word, tandeloos. Die
enigste wyse waarop die gesag van gemeenskapsinstellings geakkommodeer kan
word, is nie deur middel van stille koöptering nie, met ander woorde, 'n
eresitplek voor langs die drywer, maar sonder 'n stuurwiel in die hand nie.
Dit is eerder om hul funksieterreine duidelik af te baken en om hul
bevoegdhede te verskans. Hierdie regte van tradisionele leiers moet
grondliggend konstitusioneel aangespreek word, want dan sal dit nie nodig
wees om hulle voor elke verkiesing 'n fopspeen in die mond te sit nie. Feit
van die saak is, die dag as hulle daardie fopspeen uitspoeg, het ons almal
groot moeilikheid. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, in the first place, sincere congratulations to
the UCDP on the theme of this debate, but particularly also on the manner
in which they formulated it. I want to concentrate on one part of the
theme, namely the question of traditional leaders, which is being addressed
not only politically but also constitutionally.

I want to make the statement that the Constitution of South Africa still
fails totally to take the complexity of a deep, plural community into
account at all. The rights of traditional leaders and communities are an
object lesson of this. The crisis that arose in this regard before the
local election is clear proof of this.

This constitutional shortcoming can be traced back to an unfinished process
and an unfulfilled promise, namely the promise of international mediation
precisely in respect of these issues. Furthermore there were also a series
of unfulfilled promises thereafter. This unfinished chapter will have to be
dealt with constitutionally. Section 211 recognises the status and the role
of traditional leaders, but, ``subject to the Constitution''. Furthermore
it recognises the common law within these communities, but also ``subject
to the Constitution''. The functioning of traditional leaders is also
recognised, but, once again, ``subject to the Constitution''.

The Constitution to which they are subject, however, is a constitution that
is completely dominated by the emphasis on individual right. As a result
the institutions to which reference is made in section 212 are also
toothless. The only way in which the authority of community institutions
can be accommodated is not by means of covert co-opting, in other words
having a seat of honour next to the driver but not being able to touch the
steering wheel, but by demarcating their areas of jurisdiction clearly and
entrenching their powers. These rights of traditional leaders should
basically be dealt with constitutionally, because then it would not be
necessary to pacify them before each election. The fact of the matter is,
the day they refuse to be pacified we will all be in big trouble.]

Mr Y I CARRIM: Madam Speaker, comrades and friends, in so far as this is a
genuine call by the UCDP to address the constitutional and political issues
surrounding traditional leadership, who in this House can disagree with
that? Who, too, can disagree with the observation that much has been done?
In fact, from 1990, when the Codesa negotiations began, right up to the
very end of the parliamentary calendar last year, this issue has
persistently been addressed. [Interjections.] Well, I will deal with that
in a moment.

There are a whole lot of comments made by the opposition parties, and I am
responding from the point of view of the portfolio committee chairperson,
and I will deal largely with what Parliament has been doing in addressing
this issue. Needless to say, the Democratic Alliance, as usual, offered the
most inane and trite comments. It is to Gloria Borman in particular that I
want to respond and, in so doing, I am responding to at least some of the
other opposition leaders.

What is particularly striking is that only this very morning, in the
portfolio committee meeting, we drew attention to the fact that this Local
Government: Municipal Structures Amendment Bill, which was meant to have
been dealt with at the end of January, will, in fact, be brought before
Parliament around the third week in March. We had indicated in earlier
letters to the opposition members and our own party members why there had
been a delay, which is entirely understandable.

Now, Gloria Borman has made a whole series of wild statements. Partly one
needs to understand that she came to Parliament in June 1999. Before that,
she was obviously in a very deep coma, because she is not aware of what
happened before that. Since then she has obviously been in a semi-coma,
because we have been dealing with these issues persistently and
pervasively. [Interjections.]

What is utterly absurd, too, is that she claims that there is something
devious about the fact that we have postponed addressing the Bill. But, in
fact, the contrary is the case. It is precisely because we are serious
about addressing the issues of traditional leaders that we have had to
defer bringing the Bill before Parliament. It is precisely because
Government - the Minister will deal with this - has to consult further with
a wide range of stakeholders, not least traditional leaders, regarding this
postponement.

Lastly, Gloria has dealt with what we have not done over the past 10 years.
Let me deal with what has happened. In fact, as I said, through the
multiparty negotiating process, through Codesa, before that, in the
Constitutional Assembly process, and through the finalisation of the
Constitution that we currently have, we, in fact, have consistently and
constantly addressed the issue of traditional leadership and a democratic
society. [Interjections.]

In fact, when we dealt with the White Paper process with regard to local
government, and subsequently with the legislation that flowed from it, we
again dealt with the issue of traditional leadership and our modern
democracy. Indeed, we postponed the conclusion of the parliamentary year
last year precisely to accommodate this issue. All of us know full well
that on 20 November we were meant to have a parliamentary sitting and pass
a Bill that dealt with the role of traditional leaders in local government.
All of us, no doubt even those who did not turn up at Parliament, will know
why we had no choice but to postpone that.

In fact, as we are all aware, there is a special Cabinet committee that is
addressing this issue. We are all aware, too, that the President repeatedly
met with traditional leaders throughout much of last year. The Deputy
President has also attended to this matter. I am not sure what more is
required of us, but one thing is clear: This matter of traditional
leadership and our democracy is a matter that will be constantly addressed.
Forty years from now people will still be addressing the issue. It is far
too complex an issue, it is far too fluid an issue, it is far too dynamic
an issue to believe that we can resolve it now. We shall therefore
constantly address it. [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: It will last forever!

Mr Y I CARRIM: Good! Now, what has Government done since 1994? This ANC-led
Government has rationalised and upgraded the salaries of traditional
leaders. [Interjections.] This ANC Government, not anybody else, has
established the national House of Traditional Leaders and six provincial
houses. [Applause.] It is this Government and this President of our
Government who has put the issue of an African Renaissance on the agenda,
which in part - this is not all it means - raises the issue of our African
heritage and of traditional institutions and their important and relevant
role in a modern democracy.

We have, in fact, in Chapter 12, set out the framework for a dispensation
for traditional leaders. When we looked at the discussion document last
year, it was very striking that the House of Traditional Leaders, in their
presentation to Parliament, pointed out that the DA was not interested in
the issue of traditional leaders.

Mr M J ELLIS: Absolutely not true!

Mr Y I CARRIM: It cannot not be true, because one simply has to refer to
the report which says precisely that. I am quoting to members from the
report of the national House of Traditional Leaders. They said very clearly
that the DA was not interested in the issue of traditional leadership. It
is also very clear why Gloria Borman mouths what she does now.
[Interjections.] She has never, ever engaged concertedly with regard to
this issue. In fact, the DA is remarkable for its silence on this issue,
which they do not actually understand, as is very clear from both their
contributions.

Before us, as the Minister will no doubt explain further, is a Green and
White Paper process, which we understand will be completed by June this
year. When we had the hearings on 16 November last year absolutely every
submission, except for the submissions that came from traditional leaders,
rejected that Bill as it was then presented, on the grounds of
constitutionality, lack of democratic consultation and content. Nobody, but
nobody, apart from the traditional leaders, wanted us to process that
particular version of the Bill.

Now, there are many who argue - and we would like to put this challenge
before all the opposition parties - that it makes no sense, even though we
can have this Bill three or four weeks from now, to have a Bill now when in
fact we have an elaborate process of consultation that is unfolding. We had
a discussion document a year ago. We have the Green Paper process and the
White Paper process. Surely it is only after that process of consultation
is finished that we might want to ask ourselves whether it is necessary at
all for us to effect any constitutional amendments to reconcile traditional
leadership and a modern democracy. Only after we have considered that,
should we consider any amendments to legislation. Surely that is a
reasonable way forward.

Members must understand that people are clamouring for constitutional
amendments. That cannot come before this discussion. That Constitution was
shaped by at least two and a half million submissions before we finalised
it. Whether it is traditional leaders or the working class of this country
or whoever, the issue remains the same. That Constitution cannot be
tampered with lightly. We need to go through a process, as we have done for
the last nine or ten years, of painstaking discussion, consultation and
negotiation.

Finally, the issue of traditional leadership cannot be resolved by
consulting traditional leaders alone. There is a wide range of stakeholders
that have an enormous number of supporters and members of their
organisations who also live in traditional authority areas. In Cosatu's
case some 2 million of their members actually live in traditional authority
areas. They should be consulted, and so too should the gender commission
and so on, just like on any and every other issue. [Interjections.] We need
the widest consultation before we effect any constitutional amendments.

This portfolio committee commits itself to addressing these issues
expeditiously. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, let me thank all those who participated in
this debate so animatedly. They have surely given impetus to this question
of ubukhosi [chieftainship] and we hope that the Government will, in
future, give due attention to this whole exercise.

It has been quite interesting to notice that within the ranks of the
majority party, where they have a good number of amakhosi [chiefs] in their
stable, none of them was in this line-up. Because this whole thing is close
to their hearts and affects them directly, they have had to pick or choose
people who would say what they would like to hear, without actually
addressing the whole thing by going to its nerve. [Interjections.]

One realises that there are still ill-informed activists who go around
saying that the amakhosi are corrupt in one way or the other, whereas it is
on record that even in the past it was very clear that when people ran away
from the security forces they hid in the rural areas where they were
afforded protection, which means that it was the same amakhosi who would
help them out there.

The question of retaining the issue of amakhosi on the agenda ad infinitum
does not answer the question of when this will be addressed. It will remain
there for all eternity. All we want is action and not promises. We want
some delivery. It does not come as a surprise, because even hon Minister
Lekota, during the run-up to the elections in the Mafikeng area, went on to
tell people that from the time of the negotiations at the World Trade
Centre right up to 1996, when the final Constitution was drawn up, they did
not have time to address the question of the traditional leaders. So we are
only saying that the people who have power should give due attention to
this issue. [Interjections.]

With regard to the whole issue of having introduced the National House of
Traditional Leaders and those in the provinces, one would ask: What is it
that comes out of those houses, except for their just meeting, coming in
and going away without any clear result. The whole issue has not been
properly worked out. The Government is not giving them the necessary
support, except telling them to come and then giving them whatever they
think they have to. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Madam Speaker and hon
members, in his opening address to Parliament President Mbeki observed
that, and I quote:


  ... gradually, step by step, our country proceeds further away from its
  painful past.

The painful past that the President speaks of is the one which compelled
the unfree to fight for freedom, the oppressed to plan for liberation and
the invisible to mount the offensive for higher visibility.

In that struggle some of our traditional leaders excelled through selfless
service. Indeed, Shaka, Hintsa, Sekhukhune, Makado, Ngungunyane, Moshweshwe
and others, because they knew their place and role in that struggle, have
eternally entered the legends of the people as warriors of high renown.

It is trite to say that the struggle for a better country, a country
renewed, is not yet over. We dare not allow the sword to sleep in our hand
when our rural areas are still home to 70% of South Africa's poor. All our
efforts must be directed at putting the nightmare of poverty and
underdevelopment to flight. I have no doubt that our people expect their
leaders, traditional or elected, to co-operate with each other and to
harness their co-operation to the vision of sustainable socioeconomic
development.
As a country we are in a continuing process of transition. As we continue
to develop the essential elements of our democratic state to maturity, we
shall have to find a way of defining the role to be played by the
institution of traditional leadership in our system of governance.
Government published a discussion document as a contribution to this
process. Apart from identifying issues which require discussion and
decision, the discussion document sought to increase public information
flow in order to empower the people. We have received invaluable feedback
from many people who participated in the workshops which took place in
various parts of the country.

The relevant portfolio and select committees conducted public hearings
which generated a lot of useful insights which will be taken forward as we
proceed with the process of further defining the role of the institution of
traditional leaders in our system of governance. For its part, Government
attended a series of meetings with traditional leaders in order to seek
consensus on the interim statutory measures we need to put in place as we
continue the search for a more permanent arrangement.

Mr D H M GIBSON: [Inaudible.]
The MINISTER: Those who do not understand how things are done in a
democracy have been trying to bulldoze Government into following a route
which violates principles of participation, consultation and transparency,
principles which underpin decision-making in our public institutions.

In his letter to the coalition of traditional leaders, President Mbeki
reiterated the following points: Government will introduce a Bill to
Parliament with a view to increasing the representation of traditional
leaders in the municipal councils from 10% to 20%. As hon members know,
this has since happened. I was informed by various MECs that many
traditional leaders have indicated their readiness and willingness to take
their place in the local council structures, because they want to become co-
makers of a prosperous country.

The President also made it clear that Government will continue with the
process of formulating the White Paper on the Role, Powers and Functions of
the Institution of Traditional Leadership. The White Paper will lead to the
enactment of national framework legislation in June 2001.

Some in the country, including people in this House, have pretended that it
is the sole responsibility of Government to define a role for the
institution of traditional leadership in our system of governance. It is
puzzling to see them taking perverse delight in the so-called failure of
Government to address the concern of traditional leaders. What they call
the concern of traditional leaders should to be our common concern. No
normal person can hope to sustain the argument that problems which are
experienced by traditional leaders were created by this Government. Neither
is it correct to impute the blame for the so-called corrosion of the powers
of traditional leaders to local government.

On the occasion of the certification of our country's Constitution, the
Constitutional Court, in its judgment, said, and I quote:


  The Constitutional Assembly cannot be constitutionally faulted for
  leaving the complicated, varied and everdeveloping specifics of how
  traditional leadership should function in the wider democratic society,
  and how customary law should develop and be interpreted to future social
  evolution, legislative deliberation and judicial interpretation.

This means that defining the role of traditional leaders is the shared
responsibility of all the branches of government, and that government
decisions must have due regard for the views of the electorate.

Cabinet has appointed a committee of three Ministers and a Deputy Minister
and charged them with the responsibility of processing a Bill which will
soon be coming before Parliament. The Bill relates to an arrangement for
the interim, whilst the process leading up to the enactment of more
permanent framework legislation, as envisaged in the Constitution, remains
on course. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

            IRREGULAR USE OF TRAVEL FACILITIES BY MR K M MOEKETSE

The SPEAKER: Before proceeding to the next matter for debate, I wish to
make a statement.

Hon members, last year, on 31 October, I had to deliver a reprimand to a
member of this House for the abuse of travel facilities. Regrettably, there
is another case on which I wish to report.

Allegations about the irregular use of travel facilities also appeared in
the media with reference to the hon Moeketse. As in the previous case, I
met with Mr Moeketse and a Whip of his party and asked him to respond to
the allegations. Thereafter, I requested the disciplinary committee,
chaired by the Deputy Speaker, and composed of members from all parties, to
carry out an investigation and advise me on the appropriate action. In Mr
Moeketse's case, the Disciplinary Committee decided to have a detailed
forensic audit done before it arrived at its findings.

Once again, I want to thank the committee for its thorough work. My
decision is again based on the findings and recommendations of the
committee. However, as in the previous case, I decided that, in the
interests of Parliament and the public, I needed to ensure that the penalty
provided a deterrent and emphasised the serious nature of such abuses.

Travel benefits, as members know, are made available at public expense to
facilitate members carrying out their duties and responsibilities as public
representatives. The wilful misuse of such benefits constitutes a breach of
public trust on the part of the member. Inevitably, it also brings
Parliament into disrepute.

Parliament and the public are entitled to expect that members will set the
highest standards of ethical behaviour. Whenever these standards are
violated, Parliament needs to act firmly and decisively if it is not to
lose the confidence of the electorate.

Mr Moekeste, would you please stand while I deliver the finding of the
Disciplinary Committee?

It has been established, and you have admitted, that you allowed a friend
and your friend's child to travel from Johannesburg to Cape Town on 23
December 1999 with tickets that were purchased using your travel vouchers.
The Disciplinary Committee has further found that you knowingly misused
your travel benefits in this instance, and that there is prima facie
evidence that fraud was committed.

I therefore have no option but to issue a reprimand to you in this House
for your unbecoming conduct.
As there is prima facie evidence of fraud in respect of the trips
undertaken on 23 December 1999, I am required to refer the relevant
information and documentation in this regard to the Director of Public
Prosecutions for further investigation.

You will further repay Parliament the full transport costs of the trips to
Cape Town by an adult and a child on 23 December 1999, repayment to be
effected within 30 days from today. In addition, you will forfeit two
tickets from your allocation.

Hon Mr Moeketse, do you have a statement to make?

Mr K M MOEKETSE: Madam Speaker and members of the House, with all due
respect, I accept with humility the decision of the House and will abide by
it.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I have indicated on the previous occasion
that the Disciplinary Committee put forward various proposals to regulate
travel facilities more effectively and to control related costs. The
committee's findings and proposals have already been referred to the Joint
Subcommittee on Support for Members and to management for their urgent
attention. The remedies will also require the urgent attention of the
entire House.

   REBUILDING OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGH URBAN RENEWAL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr W M SKHOSANA: Madam Speaker, the transition to a democratic state and
restructuring of apartheid institutions is proving to be a lot more complex
and challenging than we anticipated. The change in a global environment,
and South Africa's engagement with both international institutions and
world powers, has multiple impacts on the development process, the levels
of persistent poverty and continuing vulnerability of children. South
Africa is fast integrating into a global political economy, from a new
national and regional position. Being part of the global and political
economy in this era of a high technology-driven community system, calls for
a new form of politics within and outside of the country. The
transformation of traditional institutions, and new forms of social
articulation between the Government and nongovernmental networks, are
necessary.
It is submitted that the most critical pillar of the envisaged sustainable
rural development is the following: Land, on which the Department of
Agriculture and Land Affairs is working very hard, taking the 13% question;
and water, which the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry is giving to
millions of South Africans; as well as integration and housing development.

The provinces approve and support attempts to promote integrated housing
development, as is the case in Cradock, a community which was thrown into
disarray by political upheavals during the 1980s. A project to build 2 000
units with assistance from Nurcha, brought together various sectors within
Cradock to create jobs, establish small industries and train artisans, to
empower communities to actively participate in their own development.

There is a need to ensure that all municipalities develop a uniform
procurement policy framework with clear implementation guidelines. Such an
approach must be aimed at community empowerment. Land use should be a key
instrument for social and economic empowerment. Municipalities should also
be urged to establish LED units with appropriate staff to ensure that the
process of urban and rural development is driven from there.

Development brings freedom, provided it is development of the people. Any
review of mass democratic struggle in South Africa reveals the role played
by women in the struggle more than in any other sector of the population.
The role and experience of women in the struggle for democracy highlights
how people, in the face of poverty, powerlessness and extreme deprivation,
are able to mobilise against oppression.

In the 1990s women of different organisations came together to form the
women's coalition. Their main aim was to mobilise themselves and to develop
and promote the women's charter and women's rights that resulted in their
participation in Codesa, which aimed at building a new nation.

Women are building their own homes with the subsidy amount of R16 000,
cheaper than some contractors can offer. Women are planting vegetable
gardens in their villages and at schools. I think it is important for us as
South Africans to ensure that we embrace what women are doing in this
country in order for us to rebuild our rural communities. [Applause.]

The state-of-the-nation address by the President of South Africa on 9
February 2001 made it clear that R1,3 billion, spread over seven years,
would be set aside for an integrated development programme in Alexandra.
That project will deliver housing, roads, water, sanitation, roads,
clinics, magistrates' offices and police stations.

However, I also think that we need to make the point that the people of
Alexandra were notified in advance that they would be moved from the
hazardous area around the Jukskei river. There was an agreement between the
Government and the people of Alexandra. But a few individuals within the
community of Alexandra who have vested interests have taken advantage of
the situation. [Interjections.] However, we also need to ensure that there
is development in the different provinces. In the Eastern Cape we have seen
the Smuts Ngonyama and other projects. In the North West there are
development projects in Kekana and Madikwe townships. These and others
ensure that there is urban renewal. There is development in rural areas as
well, such as in Maubane, Motla and Sterkwater. In these areas there are
contractors to develop rural housing.

We also need to make the point that there is no rebuilding of our
communities through urban renewal and rural development in the Western
Cape. There is nothing whatsoever in the pipeline in so far as housing in
the Western Cape is concerned. All provinces are trying to pull up their
socks and ensure that they house the nation. [Applause.]

Mr D K MALULEKE: Madam Speaker, hon members, let me remind the hon Skhosana
that separate development does not bring freedom.

In the first couple of years of the ANC-ruled Government programmes and
policies driven by idealism and ideological attachments were derived, and
grand-plan concepts and vocabularies commensurate with grand schemes were
developed and regurgitated by politicians and bureaucrats.

The RDP was the flavour of the day. Many of these grand plans ended up
mired in bureaucracy. Many noble projects failed because of weak management
at local level and poor monitoring by central planners.

Over the past years the Government has sought to reverse its obsession with
the big picture. There is now a sense that details matter. The plans that
President Mbeki unveiled in his state-of-the-nation address last week were
a welcome breath of fresh air, but the questions must be asked: How will
moneys be allocated; where does the R6 billion come from; which Ministry
will oversee the implementation as, as one can deduce, at least four
Ministries are involved; what are the timeframes and at what stages?

South Africa is blessed with a wealth of human and mineral resources. It is
incumbent on the ANC Government to utilise every potential skill it can
solicit in this country, regardless of colour, gender and political
affiliation.

The Government will have to mobilise local councils, chiefs, schools,
principals and local businesses and communities to buy into and participate
in its projects and initiatives. The strength of these two strategies is
that, if they succeed, they will change the way of life in many
communities. The ANC will have to come to grips with the value of
constructive criticism.

One weakness of the South African political system is that we have a
proportional representation system instead of a constituency system. One of
the advantages of a constituency system is that MPLs and MPs would be able
to co-ordinate the monitoring and implementation of certain Government
programmes, so that they could act as an early warning to the various
Ministries. I have been deployed as a DP MP for Soweto East, and I would
love to see the day when this system would change to a constituency system,
so that MPs and MPLs could be effective and accountable to their
electorate.

Our experience of the past six years was intolerance of criticism by
members of the ruling party. We in the official opposition are poised,
ready, willing and able to contribute to the upliftment of all the people
of South Africa.


  Where there is no vision, people perish, but he that keepeth the law,
  happy is he.

[Applause.]

Mrs I MARS: Madam Speaker, the President, in responding to the debate on
the state-of-the-nation address, cited part of the United Nation's
Millennium Declaration on Poverty. We, on behalf of the IFP, are totally
committed to the realisation of all objectives regarding the alleviation of
poverty and the human suffering caused by poverty.

The President also quoted from South Africa's participatory poverty
assessment of 1995 that millions of our people suffer ill-health, high
levels of anxiety and stress, and a sense of hopelessness, pervasive
demoralisation and fatalism. We, as members of this House, therefore, have
to ask ourselves whether we are doing enough, and whether we are doing it
right?

I believe the first question can be answered honestly and quickly: No, we
are not doing enough. We still do not put our country's most marginalised
people at the centre of all our debates and all our actions. The second
question is more difficult to answer and, perhaps, with a new strategy on
urban and rural renewal, we can open the debate and hopefully ensure that
the R6 billion we targeted, in a new and innovative manner, will
significantly and permanently improve the lives of our most marginalised
citizens and communities.

We wish to comment that all too often large-scale interventions fail,
because they have not adequately gauged poor people's real aspirations and
prevailing coping mechanisms. Often these interventions have been driven by
outsiders and technocrats, whose accountability is to a department, rather
than the affected communities. Whilst welcoming the commitment to a basket
of services, we hope that local people will be mobilised and given an
opportunity to determine their priorities.

Affordability, sustainability and ownership of projects is critical to
their success. Current rates of high unemployment within poor households
and communities leave them devoid of financial resources, hence
interventions that are to benefit the truly poor require a clear assessment
of sustainability.

Renewal is not only about material improvement. There is also a spiritual
dimension which lifts people out of a sense of hopelessness and despair.
Therefore, should we not review current interventions in view of
globalisation, which has little to offer our lowly skilled and poorly
educated people? Should we not assure ourselves that in view of widespread
unemployment and the socioeconomic impact of HIV/Aids, adequate provisions
are budgeted for so as not to increase the daunting levels of
impoverishment? All planned interventions should therefore, as a primary
goal, have the building of community capacity to manage development on
local norms and strengthening of family and community networks.

Our commitment to people-centred development was also emphasised by a
resolution at the NAM Conference in 1998, and we feel that a programme of
urban and rural renewal provides a golden opportunity to put people-centred
development into practice and give practical expression to that resolution.
Six billion rand, wisely spent, can make a huge difference.

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, the fact that the standard of living of the
average First World worker is much higher than that of the average worker
in South Africa; that in the First World working hours are shorter and
children are sent to school, not to farms and factories, is not because of
the achievement of government and the laws of the country, but is the
outcome of capital invested per head of the population. That this capital
investment is much higher in the First World than in South Africa is not as
a result of socialist policies or a programme like the RDP, but of the
market.

The conflict between the haves and the have-nots is a real conflict that
can best be addressed by a government that does not interfere in the market
processes. Government cannot create wealth - Government only takes. The
more Government spends, the less people have to spend. Government has no
funds, they take people's money and spend it. Government at its best can
merely create the environment in which the private sector and the people
can create wealth and a better life for urban and rural communities. Urban
and rural communities live in and around the cities and towns. These must
become centres for development and economic growth.

But contemporary cities in South Africa and the rest of the world are
facing numerous problems. Urban sprawl, crime and inner city decline are
just some of the issues facing urban centres from Johannesburg to
Jerusalem, from my own Pretoria to St Petersburg. The answer, however, may
lie in comprehensive urban planning and design.

With regard to strategies for creating positive urban and rural
development, new and innovative ways of tackling the problems of these
changing environments have to be found. But who participates, and how does
one define a future role for urban centres? Should there be a move towards
re-establishing them as centres for big business, or should they be diverse
cosmopolitan centres which are conducive to the needs of the broader
community? In the spirit of reconstruction and development, engaging with
affected communities is an important starting point in identifying needs
and creating strategies to deal with the challenges of urban and rural
development.

Small businesses are important for the rate of job creation and income
generation in the country. This sector deserves particular attention since
it has been greatly neglected in the past. Research shows that inner city
areas facilitate the hatching of new establishments.

In the past, much emphasis has been placed on physical upgrading. Social
regeneration and access to information, education and recreation facilities
is equally important in creating civic pride and sustainability. In keeping
with the philosophy of social regeneration, it is significant to
acknowledge the importance of ownership of projects. If a community owns a
project and takes pride in it, its likelihood of success is greater.

We should have a long-term vision as well. Although addressing certain
short and medium term issues is important, we should not lose track of
international economic and development trends. Sustainability is crucially
linked to tapping into broader markets. Foreign direct investments will
only come once Government creates an investor-friendly climate. [Applause.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that South Africa has one
of the best Constitutions in the world, which enshrines, inter alia, the
principles and core values upon which we as a country can rebuild and
revitalise our communities through both urban and rural development.

According to the UNDP report, South Africa 2000, the entire global picture
of South Africa in terms of social imbalances, development and service
delivery is as follows. More than 18 million South Africans live below the
poverty line, which is pegged at an income of R353 per month, rating South
Africa as second in the world after Brazil with the most skewed
distribution of income.

The poverty rate in urban areas is 28,5% as compared to 70,9% in rural
areas. The poverty rate in black communities in this country is 60,7% while
the poverty rate in the white communities is only 1%. It is against this
background that I want to concentrate on the rebuilding and revitalisation
of rural development.

[Therefore, what are we, as an integral part of a nation and
representatives of our communities, saying and doing to better the lives of
the people, against the background of an economic infrastructure that
should be the cornerstone of our Constitution? We promised all these things
to the nation during our election campaigns.]

What the voters out there currently enjoy is the right to vote every five
years, but this does not necessarily put food on the table. The UDM's
contributions and suggestions in this regard will be what we say and what
we consider to be core values for the revitalisation of, in particular,
rural development.

Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[It is a well-known fact that many of us were also milking cows, but today,
because it is time to eat, they are being pushed aside. It is these kinds
of places that have turned into hunting grounds. After forcing us to milk
the cows, the bullies have impounded those that do not even belong to
them.]

The rebuilding of rural development necessitates the review, audit
performance and revitalisation of tourism, forestry and of citrus, as well
as agricultural and other development projects which are mismanaged and
neglected by provincial executive authorities, with special reference to
the Northern Province, the Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga, which have the
highest incidence of mismanagement, incompetence and corruption.

The revitalisation of rural development ... [Time expired.]
Ms G L MAHLANGU: Madam Speaker, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, South
Africa, together with other countries in the developing and developed
world, is confronted with numerous socioeconomic and developmental
challenges. Increasing population, hunger, poverty, disease, unemployment
and a threatened and degraded environment are but a few of the sustainable
developmental challenges.

The past government's legacy, which sought to separate or marginalise
people from accessing resources for a sustainable livelihood, has made the
challenge of delivery even harder. Such a deliberate attempt and
destructive strategy have led to a situation that does not allow for basic
human needs to be fulfilled, for adequate living standards or for the
protection of the general environment.

Cities are the hardest hit by the effects of the apartheid legacy, since
these areas were portrayed and later perceived to be good for general
prosperity. This false sense of prosperity continues to dominate in terms
of the reasons people choose to leave rural areas for the city. Our
attempts to deal with rural and urban challenges take place with our past
as backdrop.

The transformation of most of the developing world from rural villages to a
world of cities and towns has seen one important characteristic coming to
the fore, namely, that those national economies are increasingly urban. The
contribution of cities to national economies have pointed to one other
thing, namely, the fact that cities work. We are fast becoming a world of
cities, yet cities are increasingly failing to deliver a quality life for
its inhabitants, primarily because of resource constraints and congestion.
Indeed, cities are engines of economic development and they have a major
role to play in addressing issues relating to the impoverishment or
prosperity of its inhabitants. It must be borne in mind, though, that
townships were never classified as part of cities, even though they are
urban areas themselves. Over the years, cities have stagnated in growth, a
stage referred to as urban decay.

Our interactions with developmental challenges should aim at integrating
these townships and coming up with a city that reflects the spirit and the
aspirations of a truly transformed South Africa. While the cities continue
and still do benefit from economic activity, townships continue to endure
environmental and social ills.

The following are some of the recommendations from the African Regional
Conference: African Solutions towards Sustainable Urban Development. In
seeking to solve problems that we face in our urban areas, there is a need
to consider the structure of cities from the perspective of the poor, and
to take the poor people's needs into account.

We who have a rural background understand that there is a lack of
channelling of resources to rural areas. By this I mean financial skills
and capacity-building.

The hon member Judy Chalmers, during the President's debate last week said:


  I have spent long hours discussing with my comrades: ``What can make it
  happen?'', with my constituency, and I would like to recount something of
  what I have been hearing.

Firstly, the practice of funding projects in remote rural areas and then
leaving people to fend for themselves has been extremely destructive,
especially to people's confidence and hopes. This has often led to
migration to big cities in search of a better life. It therefore becomes
essential that viable financial programmes are encouraged in rural areas to
boost the local people's confidence and to instil in them the pride of
improving their own lives and doing things for themselves, not for them to
be at the receiving end.

Serious thought should be given to enabling communities, through
appropriate interventions and sustained backup from dedicated advisors, to
tender for local projects and development, instead of allowing such job-
creating initiatives to go to outside consultants and contractors. This
happens too often, and it leaves the people poorer than they were before.

We have a beautiful and resource-rich country. South Africa is beautiful.
Its people are beautiful and warm. What the President said a few days ago
is a direct challenge to all of us. We need to lead the way in addressing
these issues. What differences are we making in our daily lives to improve
the lives of other people? We have the means to contribute towards a better
life, especially those of us who come and stand at this podium. The last
speaker was a prime minister in his past life, and left the people of the
Northern Province poorer than they were when he came in. Today he comes and
blames the ANC Government. [Interjections.] What a shame! If I were him, I
would not even have participated in a debate dealing with poverty knowing
that I contributed nothing to the people. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, please take your seat.

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, is the hon member prepared to take a
question? [Interjections.]

Ms G L MAHLANGU: No! [Interjections.]

Ke tla bua ka puo e rre Ramodike a tla e tlhaloganyang. Ga ke na nako ya go

[I will talk in a language that the hon member Ramodike will understand. I
do not have time to play around. I will not answer questions that will not
help me in any case.

Our people in the rural areas are so poor because of the manner in which
they had agreed to accept crumbs from the Boers, telling themselves that
South Africa could be a country of 17 countries within one country.]

If they had not agreed to those homelands, today South Africa would have
been in a better situation. They contributed a lot. [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

Gona jaanong batho ba rona ba a lela, ba lela ka gore morago ga dilo tse

follows.)

[At the moment our people are crying, because after the many things he has
done to them, he is still sitting in this House that represents the people.
He has the nerve to stand up and ask me a question. What question is he
asking me? Why should I waste my time and answer him? They have destroyed
this country. When our people wanted a better life, they wanted it for
themselves, their families and friends. Today, our people in Lebowa have
neither clean water nor proper roads. How does he feel, knowing that he
used to be one of the leaders of that kind? What did he do?]

This is the time to make a difference. When we walk the streets of South
Africa and we see people who are hungry, who have no education, it is our
task to change that. We should feel ashamed, especially people such as that
hon member, who have taken the crumbs from those ruling parties of the past
to divide our country even further. The hon member should be ashamed of
that. [Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, ideas have consequences. They produce
behaviours and lifestyles that affect people, cultures, nations and
history. The degeneration and degradation of our urban and rural areas are
a direct result of bad policies and spatial planning during the old
dispensation in South Africa.

Decades of neglect and discrimination have created townships throughout the
country with appalling services and a tiny economic base. These towns are
located on the outer edges of traditional cities. Our social institutions
and policies bear the unmistakeable imprint of our world-view, and that
inevitably shapes the world we create. Urban renewal must be seen as a
complex network of multidimensional factors which, if tackled correctly,
will raise the social and economic standards of a city.

Spatial efficiency will ensure sound planning and investment with special
focus on rebuilding the townships and creating more jobs; has an integrated
developmental plan for housing and urban amenities; reduce commuting
distances between workplaces and residential areas, and make well-located
land suitable for development with a good environmental management system.
Focus must be on local economic development to enhance the capacity to
generate greater economic activity to achieve growth and competitiveness,
and to alleviate poverty.

It does seem that the Government, with its R6 billion injection into urban
renewal projects, hopes to provide infrastructure capacity to boost the
investment potential of our cities. The Urban 21 Conference has left the
ordinary man in the dark about the future of family wellbeing, especially
with regard to job prospects, security of basic services and a safe
environment.

Government has a moral obligation to inject funds into the urban
rejuvenation projects. The measure of success will not be whether this
money is effectively utilised, but whether the capacity exists within the
state to guarantee the rule of law and order to uphold the momentum of this
renewing process.

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, the FF is on record more than once in this
House to have said that if we do not succeed in South Africa, if South
Africa as a ship goes down, we all go down together; black and white,
Afrikaner, Zulu, Xhosa, all together. Against this background we welcomed
President Mbeki's announcement of both an integrated rural development
strategy and an urban renewal programme. We think they are important and
the only way to go to solve these problems of poverty.

A week ago the new mayor of Pretoria, or Tshwane, was inaugurated. He was
inaugurated two blocks from the Pretoria railway station. The crowds
cheered that Pretoria was now governed by the ANC.
An HON MEMBER: Yes!

Dr P W A MULDER: Yes!

This morning on television, I saw how the railway station was burnt down by
those crowds. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: By the ANC?

Dr P W A MULDER: I did not say by the ANC. I said the crowds of people who
were out there. [Interjections.] Well, I imply that, the majority of
Pretoria is now ANC, so surely some of those people must have been ANC
supporters as well. [Interjections.] I can assure hon members that there
were no FF supporters there. [Interjections.] The question is, what type of
urban renewal is this?

In Afrikaans sê ons: om op te bou is moeilik; om af te breek is maklik. Die
Afrikaanse skrywer Langenhoven het gesê: ``Om af te breek, is geen kuns
nie; die swakste onder ons kry dit reg.'' Nou vra ek, is hierdie optrede
van die skare ook die gevolg van apartheid?

Hoe verklaar ons wat daar gebeur het? Of is dit die gevolge van die ANC se
revolusionêre aanslag, want die ANC bly 'n bevrydingsorganisasie wat 'n
revolusionêre gees by sy kiesers wakker hou. Die ANC beweer voortdurend dat
dit die manier is om probleme op te los. Solank dit die benadering is, kan
ons almal vergeet om op te bou. Die VF is bereid om stedelike en
plattelandse opbou te steun. Ons dink dit is uiters belangrik, maar ons sal
nooit hierdie optrede kan verstaan wat gister gebeur het nie. Ons moet eers
die gees daar buite verander, voordat ons gaan slaag daarin om op te bou.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We say that it is difficult to build, but easy to break down. The
Afrikaans author Langenhoven said, ``Om af te breek is geen kuns nie; die
swakste onder ons kry dit reg.'' [to break down is no art, the weakest
among us succeed in doing so] What I am asking now is whether this conduct
of the crowd is also the result of apartheid?

How do we explain what happened there? Or is it the result of the
revolutionary onslaught of the ANC, because the ANC remains a liberation
organisation that keeps alive a revolutionary spirit amongst its voters.
The ANC constantly proclaims that this is the way to solve problems. As
long as this is the approach, we can all forget about building. The FF is
prepared to support urban and rural development. We think it is extremely
important, but we shall never understand the kind of behaviour that took
place yesterday. We have to change the spirit out there first, and only
then will we succeed in building up.]

Mr G E BALOI: Madam Speaker, during the state of the nation address this
year, the President stated clearly that both the integrated rural
development and urban development strategies were in the process of being
implemented. The Government stated clearly that its intention was to
conduct a sustained campaign against rural and urban poverty as well as
underdevelopment, focusing the resources of all three spheres of government
in a co-ordinated way.
The thrust of the co-ordinated strategy will entail investment in the
economic and social infrastructure, human resources development, enterprise
development, the enhancement of the development capacity of local
government, poverty alleviation and the strengthening of the criminal
justice system.

The Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Strategy of 1995 sets out the
mechanism by which rural people, their elected representatives - excluding
traditional leaders, but including those who are elected - and all rural
district and local councils can take charge of the development process in
their own areas. We as the UCDP say that traditional leaders should be
taken on board.

I now come to the urban renewal strategy. The population in urban areas is
estimated to be between 19,6 and 26 million. Urban areas generate about 80%
of the gross domestic product. Consequently, efficient and productive urban
areas are important for alleviating poverty and creating a more equitable
society. We as the UCDP concur with the Government that the urban renewal
strategy is the best approach in achieving economic growth and enhancing
South Africa's global competitiveness in the world market.
Mr P M MATHEBE: Madam Speaker, hon members, I just wanted to give some
advice to the hon member Dr Mulder. [Interjections.] That bobbejaan spanner
should shut up!

Dr Mulder is old enough to differentiate between right and wrong. So, I
really must advise him to take pains and make efforts to try to teach
himself to think in a proper way so that people can say that they have
their representative in Parliament. He should not come here and say things
that are going to make the lives of our people more miserable than ever
before. He should try to think in a proper way before he comes to the
podium. I do not want to waste my time, because people might perhaps not
notice the difference between Dr Mulder and I.

The Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Strategy and the Urban Renewal
Programme are, in themselves, a systematic and unrelenting campaign against
poverty in the rural and urban areas of our country. This programme should
kick-start development in rural and urban areas, focusing, as a first
priority, on violence-torn communities and those in crisis. The accrued
results would, in the main, be an integrated approach to the provision of
infrastructure, housing, community and recreational facilities as well as
job opportunities with a view to transforming disadvantaged communities,
thereby creating sustainable and habitable environments.

The Community Water Supply and Sanitation Programme of the Department of
Water Affairs and Forestry was initiated in 1994 to achieve the
constitutional objectives of ensuring that all South Africans have access
to sufficient water and a healthy living environment. We therefore view the
Integrated Rural Development and Urban Renewal Programme as a step towards
further achieving the objective of a better life for all.

The local government will, in keeping with their constitutional mandate and
in terms of the provisions of the Water Services Act of 1997, ensure and
define the rights of access to a basic water supply and sanitation
services. These local governments will also ensure that there are
sufficient continuous, affordable and fair water services within their
communities.

I have indicated that there is a need for a concerted and systematic
offensive on water-borne diseases that are determinants of the ill-health
which continues to cripple the health of the majority of our people,
especially the rural poor. South Africa is one of the 12 most lethal
countries in the world because of our infant mortality rate, largely due to
water-borne diseases. It costs the country billions of rands every year to
treat and cope with the effects of water-borne diseases.

It is a known fact that more or less 16 million people in South Africa do
not have access to basic clean water supply and more than half of the South
African population has no sanitation services. All this is largely due to
inequalities and disregard for the lives of other people by the apartheid
government of the past.

The ANC Government has undertaken to correct all those inhumane practices
of the past. It has taken firm decisions to restore the dignity of our
suffering masses. The Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry, Ronnie
Kasrils, has just announced that the Cabinet has approved an integrated
interdepartmental approach to sanitation which will link water supply,
housing, health, local government and education.

The first step in this new integrated approach to sanitation will be the
review and alignment of sanitation policies, and more responsibilities are
going to be placed on the local government structures. These structures
will receive support from the Departments of Water Affairs, Health,
Education and Provincial and Local Government with respect to capacity-
building. The Minister further announced that the Unxu Regional Council
received R15 million and the Uthungulu Regional Council was given R20
million for water and sanitation delivery.
In his state of the nation address, the President categorically stated that
the central aim of this Government was to conduct a sustained campaign
against rural and urban poverty and underdevelopment with, among other
things, investment in economic and social infrastructure, human resource
development, the enhancement of the development capacity of local
government and poverty alleviation.

There is a need for the Department of Water Affairs, firstly, look into the
issue of reviewed tariff policy so that there is uniformity. Secondly, it
has to speed up the establishment of catchment agencies and water
committees, to accelerate water delivery and vastly reduce the rate of
water-borne diseases.

In conclusion, the fight against poverty needs the commitment and active
participation of all of us, the Government and all sectors of our society.
Thus, our people will be in the forefront of shaping their own lives as the
establishment of formal structures for integrated management of water
resources at catchment and local levels will bring in a new dimension to
the management of water resources. We therefore call on all our people to
give meaning to the Khoisan proverb that ``a dream is not a dream until it
is a dream of the whole community''.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, this debate goes to the very heart of the
South African problem - a legacy of white supremacy rule that spanned
nearly four centuries and left, in its wake communities hanging on a thread
of mere survival. At the core of the problem of rural and urban poverty is
landlessness. On average a white farmer in South Africa owns 1 500 hectares
of land compared with the 1,2 hectares of a black farmer. Putting it
differently, 40 000 white farmers own 86% of farmland.

To bring about rural development and urban renewal, the following remedial
measures should be noted: Rural women and men should be given skills so
that they will be able to use land effectively; water should be made
available in order to make the land productive and rural homes should be
electrified; co-operative farming should be introduced, with families
bringing together their small pieces of land in order to make farming
viable; and agro-based industries should be established, using existing
facilities and resources, for example, making juice or jam out of mangoes,
peaches, guavas, etc.
There should be intensive literacy programmes so that the upgrading of
industries can be undertaken. Marketing should be centralised and
undertaken co-operatively. This will ensure that wastage and rotting of
perishable commodities are reduced to a bare minimum and that reasonable
prices, locally and internationally, are negotiated.

Tourism offers great potential for both rural and urban communities. A lot
of capital is required to develop the infrastructure and ensure that
indigenous crafts, and village and township tourism, can stimulate our
tourist market, so that international guests can be exposed to the beauty
of our country, wildlife, and the rich variety of modern and ancient
traditional life.

In our towns we should develop the so-called township. We must bring towns
to the townships and reverse the one-sided flow of spending. It is
estimated that millions flow out of Soweto to central Johannesburg.
Industries should be established and jobs created so that roads and
services can be developed. [Time expired.] [Interjections.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, first of all I want to thank you and
members for the welcome I was given in this Chamber and in the committees.

Voordat ek my toespraak maak, wil ek graag hulde bring aan my voorganger,
Dr Luyt, vir sy visie en die ywer waarmee hy die opposisiepartye bymekaar
gebring het. Die FA wens hom die beste toe met sy toekomsplanne. Om fisies
in sy skoene te staan, sal vir my nie moontlik wees nie, maar ek het
dieselfde ywer en ambisie om van Suid-Afrika 'n plek te maak wat sal werk.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Before making my speech, I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, Dr
Luyt, for his vision and the diligence with which he united the opposition
parties. The FA wishes him everything of the best with his plans for the
future. It would be impossible for me to step into his shoes physically,
but I have the same enthusiasm and ambition to make of South Africa a place
that will work.]

I have been a public representative for 27 years. [Interjections.] I was a
mayor, a city councillor, a member of parliament and served on Mr Tokyo
Sexwale's cabinet as an MEC. Before entering politics, I was a design
engineer in South Africa, the United States of America and Great Britain.

En dit is vir my moeilik om vir 'n tweede keer in 22 jaar 'n
nooienstoespraak te kom maak. [And it is difficult for me to come and
deliver a maiden speech for the second time in 22 years.]

I therefore seek to enter this debate, namely the rebuilding of South
African communities through urban renewal and rural development, from the
historical background and experience that I have at hand. The point I wish
to make is that politicians are accountable for the success or failure of
rural development or urban decay in their regions. They create the
environment in which industry and business have to function effectively.
Whenever we inherit urban decay, we must deal with it, and I believe we
can.

What better example can I cite of a South African community who dealt with
such decay and development than Oudtshoorn, the homeland of the ostrich. A
century ago it was one of South Africa's wealthiest areas. Then feathers
went out of fashion, and it nearly closed down its industry. But it made a
comeback after realising that they must market more than feathers. They
have put their town and the region back on every tourist, fashion designer
and leather goods manufacturer's business programme. They created
additional business for many entrepreneurs in the free-market industry.
Artists now paint egg shells, the toes and the feet of the birds are turned
into ornaments, and the meat is served in most of our restaurants
countrywide. They have created jobs all over the country. Is it not
possible that the same success can be achieved by Angora goat farmers in
the Eastern Cape? What about other products in other regions and sectors of
our economy?

If we want to fight urban decay, and promote rural development, we, as
politicians, must work together with business, industry, commerce and
agriculture in our regions to market our people's skills, and not
accentuate our political ideologies. There must be closer co-ordination
between politicians at the various levels of government when we plan and
redevelop urban centres so that the mass transport nodes can be closer to
the business centres. This will make it easier for mass transport users,
the poorest of the community, to do their shopping on their way to work and
back.

We must also not build our civic centres and our public buildings on the
shores of the only lake in our town. We do not get revenue from such
buildings. We must reserve such properties for hotels and waterfronts in
order to be able to get revenue from them. Together with our town planners
and other government officials, we must be bold enough, without hesitation,
to adjust policies and correct human engineering failures.

Surely, we cannot feel proud that the Carlton Hotel had to close its doors,
and that the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and other businesses had to move
from the Johannesburg CBD. Did not all us feel rebellious when the statue
of the jumping impalas was vandalised in the Oppenheimer Park in
Johannesburg? Are members ready to say: Enough is enough, from now on, as
in Singapore, we must penalise people who litter and trash our streets?

The fact that we are debating this issue is sending a signal to Government
that we will no longer tolerate the decay of our urban areas, and that we
want to see development programmes that will elevate us to levels where we
would be proud to receive tourists in our towns and cities.

Ek dank die lid wat hierdie voorstel na die debat gebring het. Dit was vir
my 'n voorreg om aan die debat deel te neem. [Applous.] [I thank the member
who introduced this motion for debate. It was a privilege for me to
participate in the debate. [Applause.]]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, good governance functions on the principle
that our people come first. The rural people of all the rural areas are our
people, and were neglected for hundreds of years.

To achieve economic and social development evenly throughout the country,
it requires the appropriate allocation of physical, financial and human
resources in the urban and rural areas. The sustainability of capacity-
building projects will depend on whether the following infrastructures are
available: Transport, telecommunication networks, tourism facilities,
electricity and water supply, sanitation, the building and construction of
houses, access to health and education facilities.
To empower the disadvantaged and alleviate poverty, a balance in urban-
rural economic development must be maintained. This can be achieved by
promoting economic diversification, manufacturing on a small scale, and
local importation. Pilot local economic development projects implemented in
Midrand, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Khayelitsha, Nelspruit and Harrismith
revealed many strengths and weaknesses.

To rehabilitate the flaws in these economic development projects, the
following must be achieved: Firstly, the role and responsibility of
national, provincial and local government must be clearly defined.
Secondly, the public-private partnership must be administered to achieve
effective service delivery and job creation. Thirdly, these projects face
many financial constraints, and therefore, the restructuring and
reorientation of the Development Bank of Southern Africa, and the local
authorities loan fund must be reconsidered.

Fourthly, critical efforts must be made to establish intensive community
and labour participation. Fifthly, we must identify a multitude of factors
that inhibit farming from developing land, such as the land and tenure
system, lack of skills and vocational training and community dynamics.
Finally, urban and rural development projects must be constantly monitored
and evaluated by the local government in order to see and determine their
success. [Applause.]

Mr B M SOLO: Madam Speaker, Ministers, Deputy Ministers and hon members of
Parliament, this debate is nothing other than spelling out the meaning of
rebuilding our communities, as well as setting out the process of ensuring
urban renewal and rural development.

It is a known fact that development in this country has been unequal for
many decades. There are areas where there has been massive concentration of
resources for development. Regrettably, huge areas were deliberately
neglected or ignored. And those are mostly found in black urban and rural
areas. That is a big problem that contributes to all kinds of socioeconomic
ills, such as gross disparities in the levels of social and human
development, inequitable access to basic services, profound imbalances in
the economy, high levels of poverty, etc.

One of the problems experienced in the course of rebuilding our communities
through urban renewal and rural development, is a structural one.
Institutions that would primarily, under normal situations, carry out this
task, were not structured in such a way that they would be able to do so.
Hence we came with the Local Government: Municipal Structures Act.

Secondly, indeed, there were no systems in place to ensure developmental
planning in orientation. This, therefore, resulted in the introduction of
the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act that has recently been
effected. This Act enables us to carry the mandate, responsibility and the
task of ensuring urban renewal and rural development. The need to rebuild
our communities cannot be questioned. To do so, strategies and programmes
such as sustainable rural and urban development, have to be developed.

Local government is structured in such a way that there is some form of
interlink between urban and rural communities so as to ensure integrated
development planning. The new Local Government: Municipal Systems Act
guarantees such interaction and integration. Therefore, we shall have no
doubt about our obligation in using such structures and systems, to ensure
effective renewal and development.

In his speech two weeks ago, the President of the Republic of South Africa,
Comrade Thabo Mbeki, captured this aspect clearly. I quote:


  In both instances, our central aim is to conduct a sustained campaign
  against rural and urban poverty and underdevelopment, bringing in the
  resources of all three spheres of Government in a co-ordinated manner.

Therefore, the introduction of the new system of local government is but
one of the major elements to ensure just that. The system is aimed at
ensuring the elimination of resource disparities between the poor and the
rich. As such, urban renewal and rural development is aimed at addressing
the continued persistence of socioeconomic infrastructure and spatial
imbalances.

Again the President mentioned that the Ministry for Provincial and Local
Government will be acting as co-ordinator in this regard. I would like to
remind the hon members of the DP about this. Apparently they cannot listen
or hear when people are speaking here. Therefore, local government in urban
and rural areas would be the focal institution of Government. In essence,
local government in its transformed form is aimed at performing those
functions that are geared at taking forward this programme.

In the legislation governing local governments, clear sections such the
community participation, integrated development planning and key
performance indicators are incorporated. As such, these sections guarantee
implementation of urban renewal and rural development. Thus, the programme
of building our communities through urban renewal and rural development
strategy reinforces our objective to fight poverty and create a better life
for all. This programme is dictated by existing material conditions that we
dare not pretend do not exist. Indeed, something has to be done urgently,
and this strategy is geared towards doing just that.

Once more, the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, through integrated
development planning, specifically provides realistic ways of bringing
about the development that will ensure socially cohesive, resilient and
stable rural communities that are economically empowered and productive.
This applies equally to urban communities. Planning would be such that
there is constant relationship between urban and rural areas.

(Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[The Local Government: Municipal Systems Act states that everybody,
particularly poor people, should be involved in the creation of health
infrastructure for our people. The needs of our people include electricity,
water and other things that are important to them.

It is important to have a municipal council whose task is to improve the
lives of our people. It is the duty of a municipal council to emphasise the
importance of its existence. It must ensure that it deals with issues of
community development. Municipal councils have a duty to bring about
economic development in their communities. They also have to build safe
places and ensure health care where we live.]

For the success of the strategies, the Act provides for the participation
of all our people. So there is no way views and input of all people and
sectors can be ignored, because development is for the people. We shall
then, all of us, have to mobilise all our people to participate in these
programmes as provided for in some sections of the Local Government:
Municipal Systems Act.

We shall indeed ensure that no technocrat would sit in some corner and
devise plans that are not people-driven. Lest we forget, building our
communities through the urban renewal and rural development strategy is our
clear objective, and we shall do just that. We shall have to deal
decisively with the apartheid spectra that have subjected many of our
people to conditions of abject poverty. The call to all of us that we must
unite for change is very relevant. [Applause.]

Mr J H NASH: Madam Speaker, in line with the objectives set out in the
address to the nation by our President, the Government has decided to
tackle the plight of the poverty-stricken in South Africa head-on. The
poorest of the poor have been left to fend for themselves without access to
basic services such as clean water and electricity for all these years.

The national Government proposes a basic poverty-relief tariff system for
poor households. All electrified poor households will be provided with free
basic grid and nongrid electricity services, to cover basic electricity
costs.

The proposed electricity basic service support tariff system will be
implemented in 2001 and 2002 at an annual cost of R1,8 billion, and will
start in June this year. All households will be provided with 50 kilowatts
of free grid electricity per month. Block or step tariff for grid
electricity consumption beyond kilowatts to mitigate the cost implication
of free basic electricity will be introduced, in consultation with Eskom
and the National Electricity Regulator.

Free nongrid electricity services to all nongrid-electrified households
will be provided to a maximum of R40 per household and will be funded from
the energy component of the equitable share grant to municipalities. Any
difference between the actual maintenance and operation costs will be borne
by the consumer.

These pilot schemes in the year 2000 and the 2001-2002 financial year,
targeted to benefit the poor, must be considered as options and a challenge
to implement. The implementation of nongrid electricity areas in 2001 and
2002 will be funded to a maximum of R40 per month from the equitable share
grant. As many rural areas do not benefit from the equitable share grants,
a special grant, based on cross-subsidisation, will be used. Those who can
pay, must pay.

An HON MEMBER: We want a better scheme.
Mr J H NASH: Those who cannot pay must be assisted to have access to
electricity.

All these years local authority funding came mostly from the electricity
sold at a profit. The problem was that the system was not transparent. The
issue of cross subsidisation will still be a reality while we consider
sustainable economic development. Education in the use of electricity is
vital. The creation of effective management and administrative machinery in
every municipality is vital. Equipment should work properly and the reading
of meters should be regular, accurate and efficient, to eliminate doubt and
confusion.

We have been advocating an integrated use of energy. The use of paraffin
and liquid petroleum gas should assist the poor to save on electricity use.
Paraffin is the fuel of the poor. We must strive to reduce the price of
paraffin. Paraffin has its problems, as it is poisonous and creates a fire
hazard.

Education in the use and storage of paraffin is vital for the safety of our
communities, especially in informal areas. We must ask ourselves why liquid
petroleum gas costs three times as much as in other countries. We must
engage the petroleum companies to get them to reduce the price of gas to an
affordable level. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: How much will you charge?

Mr J H NASH: The issue of paraffin and gas pricing is an inhibiting factor
to the access and use of these products. Our President has stressed that
mining in the rural areas should benefit the rural communities in the area.
Sustainable mining development in rural areas should involve public
participation, and should benefit the communities as a whole.

I think I will cut short this speech, because I need to deal with the New
NP. [Laughter.] [Interjections.] Why has the NP not provided basic services
to the people who voted for them? [Laughter.] [Interjections.] Why have
they, three months after the elections, run away from the idea that they
must provide basic services for them. [Interjections.] They must answer
that. [Interjections.] The DP, the party of doom, has taken them for a
ride. [Laughter.] There they sit. They turn around and abdicate their
responsibility towards the people who voted for them. The only thing that
they have left is the coloured community of the Western Cape, and now they
turn around and say they are not going to provide them with basic services.
They should be ashamed of themselves. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

As for Mr Lee and his party, the DP, these people have taken hon members
for a ride. Can they not see that? [Laughter.] Why did they join them? Tell
me? [Laughter.] [Interjections.] They have made fools of themselves by
joining them, because now Tony Leon is sitting there and crowing at their
expense. [Laughter.] [Applause.] But, worst of all, the people of the
Western Cape are not getting basic services, because their Marais has
decided not to give it to them. We are sick and tired of this. There he
comes.

Mr I J PRETORIUS: Mevrou die Speaker, sal die agb lid 'n vraag neem? [Madam
Speaker, will the hon member take a question?]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr J H NASH: Madam Speaker, there, he has come back to life!
[Interjections.] [Laughter.] [Applause.]
The SPEAKER: Order! Did you wish to raise a point of order?

Mr I J PRETORIUS: Madam Speaker, I wanted to ask that hon member a
question, but his time has expired.

The SPEAKER: Order! Unfortunately his time had expired before you rose.

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Madam Speaker, hon members, comrades and
colleagues, hon D K Maluleke and hon M N Ramodike should please wake up and
smell the roses. [Interjections.] I did not feel them by my side when the
ANC waged a fight against the social injustices that have led to the
infrastructural backlog, proliferation of informal settlements, the
scarcity of basic services and the economic decay of our country - a
reality most South Africans are familiar with.

Unfortunately some of the hon members on my left would prefer not to
remember or talk about the past. They prefer to continue as if it is
business as usual. The reality is that most families are living in subhuman
conditions as a result of past policies. Our society remains characterised
by wide and increasing gaps between the rich and the poor; inequalities
remain between different racial groups - we get the homeless, the
inadequately housed and those thrown into absolute abject poverty. The
urban and rural landscape continues to be separated by the disparities in
basic services, while at the same time united by the common strain of urban
and rural poverty.

We have made significant inroads in ensuring that basic services are
extended to all our people. However, there is a need to embark upon a
focused and coherent strategy that will deliver basic services in an
integrated manner, while at the same time dealing holistically with past
imbalances.

South Africa is a land consisting of both the developed and the
underdeveloped and will be undergoing drastic social and economic change in
the next few months. The time has come to swiftly address those parts of
the country that have been trapped in a time warp. The urban renewal and
rural development strategies are a decisive intervention to consolidate
human settlements and support the economy. In addition, it is a way of
ensuring integration and countering the spatial distortions of the past. We
are redrawing and consolidating the South African landscape that has been
cruelly chopped into little jigsaw pieces by past policies.

Over 5 million people who have benefited from the delivery of basic
services will shortly be joined by countless others through the
implementation of the integrated rural development and urban renewal
strategies. These will provide an opportunity to our people to have a
choice and an alternative denied by the racial rule. We are giving our
people a choice based on the premise that South Africa belongs to all who
live in it.

Furthermore, we are reconnecting all parts of our country to the whole.
Dysfunctional parts are given a new lease of life and connected with the
massive transformation drive currently sweeping through the country. As the
President said, we need to unite in action against urban and rural poverty
for the implementation of social justice and accelerated change.

Alexandra, the home of many of our South African leaders and luminaries,
will benefit from the first leg of the urban renewal and redevelopment
plan. The old Alexandra, or Alexandra proper, the East Bank and the Far
East Bank, with a population estimated at 1.2 million, occupying about 4
060 houses and 34 000 informal shacks, will benefit from R1.3 billion
rolled over the next seven years.

The living conditions of our people will be markedly improved through the
installation of infrastructure and services. We will be able to reclaim the
open spaces. We will bring health and a better quality of life to our
people. I must also say that section L of KwaMashu will also benefit from
this exercise. We will be able to create transportation and economic nodal
points where there were none. We will open up access to the criminal
justice system through the establishment of community courts, thereby
ensuring that the safety and security of our people is taken care of.

This will be done as a moral response to tackling all the social ills we
are facing. We all have a moral obligation to participate in the
reconstruction of this country and the continent in general, because we
believe that through these two strategies our communities will cease to
work like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, but unite in an integrated manner for
sustainable development. The countless men, women and children who have
been subjected to subhuman conditions will, for the first time, be the
beneficiaries of access to basic services and improved living conditions,
things most of us take for granted.

Regarding the DA, at the last count reports showed that none of our
colleagues there had voted for or fought against apartheid. Its horrific
effects still cut across our society and are felt most profoundly by those
who are fighting against them. However, their vociferously vocal arguments
against all progressive initiatives, particularly around the issue of the
reconstruction and development of our country, have robbed them of the
opportunity to join us and become active participants and champions of
nation-building.

We sincerely hope that this time all the members of the DA will do the
honourable thing and join us in support of the movement to reconstruct the
country's rural and urban landscapes through the implementation of the
rural and urban development programmes. This time we hope to feel their
presence because, quite frankly, opposing transformation is not only folly,
but it is hopelessly undesirable and treacherous.

We invite the DA to join this movement and wage war, a relentless war
against urban and rural poverty. It is time that they appreciate the
magnanimity of the ANC, inviting them to change for the better. I want to
ask them not to fight progress, but rather to fight poverty, the most
vicious enemy stalking our people wherever they are. Do they not want to be
champions of a good cause just for once?

I want to tell Mrs Borman that the ANC did not delay implementation of its
programme. Today we are talking about 6 million people who now have water,
we are talking about 4 500 new telephone lines installed between 1999 and
2000, we are talking about 127 clinics that were built in the year 2000
only, we are talking about more than a million houses built since 1994,
something that they could never ever hope to achieve. [Applause.]
[Interjections.]

We are talking here about over a million housing opportunities provided for
our people. We are talking here about an economy that never grew all the
time that we were sitting in this Parliament, and for a change we are
beginning to look at an economy which is providing hope for all of our
people.
For the first time this country, South Africa, is not a pariah among
nations. It is one of those countries that is being looked upon by the
whole world to give guidance and provide a system that is going to make
sure that each and every poor person in South Africa, on the continent and
in the world, does benefit from the new policies and strategies.

If members of the DA want to be human beings with dignity, they should join
the ANC, join the IFP that has joined the ANC in making the quality of life
of our people better. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
The House adjourned at 17:07.
