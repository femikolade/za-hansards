APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 1 - Presidency:

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, hon  members
and fellow South  Africans,  I  understand  that  today  is  Minister  Essop
Pahad's birthday. [Applause.] Today is also the day of the  eclipse  of  the
sun. [Laughter.] But, I was also told earlier today that when the battle  of
Isandlwana was fought, in 1879, there was an eclipse of the sun.

A few days ago, our people joined together in their thousands,  solemnly  to
mark the 25th anniversary of the Soweto uprising;  to  pay  tribute  to  the
thousands of young people who died and were maimed so that all of us  should
be free; to commit our country to the development, upliftment and  happiness
of the young; and to reaffirm our resolve to defend our democratic gains.

As we marched down the streets of Soweto to commemorate  the  fateful  march
of June 16, 1976, we saw a young white girl  in  her  early  teens  standing
together and holding hands with young black girls in the streets of  Soweto,
a happy smile on her face and an enthusiastic wave  to  the  marchers,  safe
and relaxed in the company of  her  friends.  Our  observance  of  the  25th
anniversary of the Soweto uprising was, therefore, also  a  celebration.  We
gathered in many parts of our country, including Soweto,  to  celebrate  our
historic achievement that the children of  our  country  across  the  colour
line can, today, walk together hand in hand as friends.

We celebrated the fact that our people can march down  our  streets  without
fear of being shot and killed, regardless of the cause  that  they  seek  to
advance. We celebrated the achievement that  we  could  gather  together  as
South Africans and set ourselves common national tasks focused  on  ensuring
that the society that we are building presents a  much  happier  future  for
the young, than that our children faced 25 ago.

We gathered to celebrate the  fact  that  we  could,  together,  salute  the
victories of both Andrew Kelehe, this year's Comrades Marathon male  winner,
and Retief Goosen, victor of the 2001 US Golf Open. [Applause.]

It would be correct to say  that,  as  South  Africans,  we  could  not  but
observe the 25th anniversary of the Soweto uprising. After all, June 16  was
proclaimed our National Youth Day precisely to pay permanent tribute to  the
youth who died for our liberation. But, of great importance,  we  were  also
joined in the commemorations by the peoples of the world.  For  example,  to
mention only three countries, two  events  took  place  in  Mozambique,  one
involving the government of that country and another that entailed  a  visit
to a cemetery where many of our country's liberation fighters are buried.

Rallies and public meetings were held in various parts of  the  Republic  of
Congo, including the capital city, Brazzaville. Thirty-five thousand  people
participated in the mass rally in Amsterdam in the Netherlands.  In  all  of
these instances, the countries that held June  16  meetings  last  week  had
been  active  participants  in  the  protracted  global   struggle   against
apartheid. Perhaps it was, therefore, to be expected that they  would,  once
again, express solidarity with us as we commemorated the Soweto uprising.

But, I believe that if we were to conclude that this was the  only  or  even
the principal reason that these other peoples remembered June 16,  we  would
be wrong. There is another and larger reason for the renewed expressions  of
solidarity that we saw last week. Our country  contains,  within  it,  in  a
concentrated form, many of the  major  and  interconnected  challenges  that
face a global community. Similarly it has, within it, the potential for  the
successful resolution of these challenges.

As  a  country,  we  represent  the  great   divide   that   separates   and
distinguishes  the  countries  of  the  North  from  those  of  the   South.
Accordingly,  we  must  succeed  within  our  own  borders  to  bridge   the
structural gaps that exist  between  the  developed  South  Africa  and  the
underdeveloped  South  Africa,  ending  the  poverty  and   underdevelopment
typical of the countries of the South.

 As  an  African  country,  affected  by  both  conscious  and  subconscious
negative and pessimistic views about the role, the place and the  future  of
Africa and Africans, we are also faced with  the  challenge  practically  to
disprove this negativity and pessimism. What we  do  must  also  succeed  in
bridging the structural gaps that exist between South Africa  as  a  country
of the South and the countries of the North.

We stand out as a country that must succeed in creating a nonracial  society
and thus address the important issue of the defeat of racism globally.  This
must be expressed both in the defeat of  racist  consciousness  and  in  the
reconstruction of our country to end the  racial  disparities  we  have  all
inherited.

The relationship between race, gender and  poverty  dictates  that  we  also
succeed in the effort to achieve the  emancipation  of  women.  Neither  the
internal North-South divide nor the racial imbalances can be solved  if  the
disempowerment of and discrimination against women are  not  brought  to  an
end.

The poverty that affects millions of our people is yet  another  feature  of
our reality. Once more, we will not succeed in overcoming the  internal  and
external North-South divide, racism and sexism unless we  eradicate  poverty
among all our people.

The world community  of  nations  is  aware  of  the  fact  that  our  young
democracy is confronted by the task to achieve forward movement towards  the
simultaneous resolution of all these problems.  Of  course,  these  problems
are not exclusive to us, but they do find a  particular  expression  in  our
country that highlights the historic and global importance of  our  national
project for reconstruction and development.

Since 1994, this Parliament has considered various White  Papers  and  other
policy initiatives and approved hundreds of laws focused on the creation  of
the policy guidelines and the legislative framework that would guide  us  as
a  government  in  carrying  through  our  process  of  reconstruction   and
development. Consistent with our Constitution and law,  our  judiciary,  and
especially the Constitutional Court, has also helped to establish the  legal
framework to which we have referred.

Only yesterday, correct reference was made in this House to  the  fact  that
our democratic Parliament has sought to ensure that it opens  itself  up  to
access by all our people. The people have therefore  been  important  actors
in the determination of the policies and the legislation to  which  we  have
referred. I am certain that the House will agree  that  we  need  to  review
this public participation continuously, to improve access by the  public  to
the determination of the destiny of our country.

As a result of  the  serious  work  that  the  Government,  Parliament,  the
general public and the judiciary have done since 1994 to place  our  country
on a path of fundamental social transformation, the Government is firmly  of
the view that, substantially, we have  elaborated  the  policy,  legislative
and constitutional base that will enable us to  achieve  the  transformation
of South Africa.

This base encompasses a wide variety of challenges that our  country  faces,
including  the  creation  of  a  nonracial  and   nonsexist   society;   the
eradication of poverty; economic growth and development; the protection  and
development  of  children,  the  young  and  the  disabled;  human  resource
development; the modernisation of our country consistent  with  advances  in
science and technology; popular participation in the process of  governance,
especially at the local level; and the assumption  by  our  country  of  its
rightful place within the international community.

Of course, there are a number of areas that continue  to  receive  attention
as we seek to finalise our policy and other positions. These  include  youth
policy, the role and place of our traditional leaders, the establishment  of
the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights  of  Cultural,
Religious and Linguistic Communities and the policy  framework  relating  to
information and communication technology. Work on  these  and  other  issues
will proceed apace. However, this does not gainsay  the  fact  that,  as  we
have said, substantially, we have established  the  policy  and  legislative
base that enables us to effect the social transformation  that  our  country
needs.
Accordingly, the central challenge we face as the Government is the task  of
implementation. The order of the day is that we take all necessary  measures
to ensure that the policy and legislative measures  for  the  reconstruction
and development of our country that have already been  adopted  are  further
translated into an actual process of the transformation of our society.

To summarise the message we seek to communicate to this  House  and  to  the
country today, it is simply this: Let us get down to  the  serious  business
of work - working together to create a new South  Africa;  working  together
to build a country free of  racism  and  sexism;  working  together  to  end
poverty, unemployment and the social marginalisation of many of our  people;
working together to give an example to the whole world that,  as  a  people,
we have the capacity to succeed, however difficult the challenges  we  face.
The order of the day is to get down  to  the  serious  business  of  working
together for change.

As a people, we have the capacity and the obligation to transform our  noble
vision of what we want  into  reality.  We  have  the  possibility  and  the
responsibility to  ensure  that  no  black  South  African  feels  that  our
liberation means nothing to him or her, and  that  our  liberty  is  nothing
more than a means for the legitimisation of the old order against  which  so
many fought and sacrificed their lives.

We have the possibility and the  responsibility  to  ensure  that  no  white
South African feels that the emancipation of our country means  for  him  or
her marginalisation, disempowerment, exclusion and having  to  live  forever
under a threat of violence, dispossession and the destruction of  everything
he or she holds dear, including language, culture and religion.

We have the policies and the mechanisms, actually, to move  forward  towards
the emancipation of the women of our country so that we give real effect  to
the equality clause in our Constitution. Thereby  would  we  throw  off  our
shoulders the accumulated burden of the millennium, according to which  true
freedom has  been  denied  to  half  of  our  population  on  the  basis  of
entrenched prejudices that constitute an  insult  and  an  injury  to  other
human beings.

We have taken the necessary decisions to end the poverty and  dehumanisation
that continue to afflict millions of our people, who cannot  lead  lives  of
dignity because they have no jobs, no houses, no land,  no  capital  and  no
means to prevent themselves from falling ill from avoidable diseases.  These
are fellow South Africans who are  forced  to  beg  and  to  depend  on  the
charity of others because, whatever they do, they cannot break  out  of  the
whirlpool of poverty.  The  challenge  we  face  is  to  get  down  to  work
practically to accelerate the impact of our  policies  on  these  and  other
matters.

For the Government, this brings into sharp focus the two  matters  to  which
we must constantly return. These are the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of
the personnel in our Public Service, and the  institutions  of  state  which
need to translate our policies into state programmes of action  for  change.
Among these, is the Presidency itself.

As hon members are aware, the Presidential Review Commission on  the  Reform
and Transformation of the  Public  Service  in  South  Africa  made  various
comments on and suggestions relating to the Presidency. Among other  things,
it noted that concerns about weaknesses at the centre of Government  were  a
recurring theme during the  public  hearings  that  were  conducted  by  the
commission. It argued that a unified Presidency ought to  be  the  core  and
apex of the whole system of governance in South Africa, as it is elsewhere.

It further argued that the Presidency needs to have the capacity  to  ensure
that issues and policies, requiring consideration by the President, and  the
Deputy President and the Cabinet, are identified; that  the  groundwork  for
their  presentation  is  thoroughly  prepared,  with  all  of  the  relevant
departments  involved;  that  there  is  comprehensive  and   comprehensible
briefing; that policies and outcomes are properly and promptly  secured  and
recorded; that implementation  follows  and  that  progress  is  effectively
monitored. To realise these objectives, the  Presidency  has  focused  on  a
number of areas.

 We have worked and are working to  build  capacity  in  the  Presidency  to
ensure that there is  proper  co-ordination  and  monitoring  of  Government
work. To  this  end,  work  is  continuing  to  strengthen  the  Policy  Co-
ordination and  Advisory  Services  Unit  in  order  to  provide  especially
analytical and policy support to the Presidency.

In this regard we  have  been  faced  with  the  challenge  of  finding  the
appropriate additional high calibre people to staff this  unit,  bearing  in
mind the budget of the Presidency  and  the  salary  levels  in  the  Public
Service. In addition to the support it lends to the  Presidency,  this  unit
also supports and works with the clusters of Directors-General.

In order to effectively monitor Government performance  and  to  ensure  the
integrated  delivery  of  services,  we   are   developing   an   electronic
information management system. The system  will  enable  the  Presidency  to
manage and monitor the performance of Government on a  more  systematic  and
continuous basis. The Cabinet Office has also been restructured in a  manner
that seeks to respond to the recommendations of the review  commission.  The
Cabinet Office  will  manage  the  information  system  that  we  have  just
mentioned.

In the past, we have  reported  in  this  House,  that  the  Presidency  has
established four consultative groups in  the  economic  sphere  encompassing
the trade unions,  black  business,  big  business  and  agriculture.  These
consultative groups,  which  meet  regularly,  ensure  that  the  Presidency
remains in touch with the representative spectrum of  sentiment  and  wisdom
in our  country.  They  also  create  the  necessary  climate  within  which
Government and the people can act in the economy, in a manner  that  frankly
addresses  issues  that  affect  us,  as  we  advance  the  project  of  the
reconstruction and development of our country.

The importance of the mentioned interaction was demonstrated recently,  with
the agreement between the Chamber of Mines and the  Department  of  Minerals
and Energy, in respect  of  the  important  Mineral  Development  Bill  that
Parliament will consider later this year.

We  are  in  the  process  of  setting  up  another   working   group   with
representatives of our religious  communities.  We  are  certain  that  this
working group will contribute to the important issues of the eradication  of
poverty and underdevelopment, as well  as  the  critical  challenge  of  the
moral renewal of our country.

We  have  also  completed  the  process  of  setting  up  the   Presidential
International Advisory Council on Information and Communication  Technology,
and we will draw on the experience and knowledge  of  the  members  of  this
council in the same way as we do with regard to the Presidential  Investment
Advisory Council.

The new integrated system of Cabinet committees and Cabinet clusters is  now
fully operational. The system has contributed to the  fluency  of  decision-
making, the efficiency of the conduct of Cabinet business, as  well  as  co-
ordinated and integrated planning and implementation at  the  level  of  the
national Government.

The committees have reduced the fragmentation of  governance  to  which  the
Presidential Review Commission referred, and are well placed to ensure  that
concerted action is taken towards speedy policy  implementation.  Obviously,
this integrated Cabinet system is managed by the Presidency.

At the initiative of the Presidency, the directors-general  have  also  been
grouped into clusters. Two Ministers per Cabinet Committee  are  responsible
for facilitating the work of Cabinet clusters, as well as for liaising  with
the clusters of directors-general.

The Government has also  developed  an  integrated  planning  framework  and
planning cycle system. The system will ensure  that  proper  trade-offs  are
made in  the  use  of  state  resources.  In  the  absence  of  an  explicit
integrated planning framework and cycle, the  planning  cycle  of  a  single
department may very well skew policy implementation as has happened, and  we
want  to  avoid  this.  Naturally,  the  Presidency  has   facilitated   the
development of this framework.

The President's Co-ordination Council, where the President  and  the  Deputy
President meet with the premiers from all of  the  provinces,  continues  to
function effectively to address matters affecting  provincial  and  national
Government. As our various policies  enter  the  implementation  stage,  the
Council will act both as a consultative forum and a critical point  for  the
monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  programmes  that  fall  within  the
responsibility of both  national  and  provincial  governments.  The  Deputy
President and the Minister in the Presidency will refer to some of the  work
done in the Presidency in the past year.

 Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to express  my  sincere
thanks to the Minister and Deputy Minister of Finance and the  Treasury  for
the work they have done to respond to the needs of the  blind.  I  refer  to
the publication in Braille  of  18  volumes  of  this  year's  Estimates  of
National Expenditure to ensure that our blind compatriots are fully able  to
participate in the debate about  the  socioeconomic  transformation  of  our
country. [Applause.]

I have here volume 4 of those Estimates of the 18 volumes in  Braille.  And,
I would really like to say many  thanks  to  the  people  in  the  Treasury.
[Applause.] For it to succeed in its work, the Presidency needs to have  the
necessary capacity, both in respect of the numbers of people  and  also  the
nature and levels of skills necessary to discharge its responsibilities.

The need to ensure that we  have  appropriate  capacity  at  the  centre  of
Government will be balanced with the rightsizing process of  Government.  It
is not only the Presidency that needs to be strengthened. In order  to  meet
the challenges of poverty and  underdevelopment  in  our  country,  we  need
properly trained people to ensure the  proper  implementation  of  the  very
policies that this House has approved.

One of the main challenges of  Government,  therefore,  is  to  improve  the
skills of our public servants and ensure that there is appropriate  capacity
for relevant Government duties and responsibilities. To cite some  examples,
it is, therefore, important that we should ensure that the initial  training
of 10 000 public servants on information technology  skills  and  5  000  on
financial management, is urgently and successfully  completed.  Furthermore,
the training of 10 000 police officers through  the  Adult  Basic  Education
and Training programme, and 5 000 Home Affairs  workers  that  will  undergo
further training in administration, must be treated as an urgent task.

As the House is aware, the intensive training  of  Government  employees  so
that they can discharge their  responsibility  efficiently  will  also  take
place at the level of local government. To  this  end,  national  Government
has set aside R550 million as a transitional fund to  assist  municipalities
to establish core systems that are central to the delivery  of  services  to
our people.

At the same time, I think all of us would agree  that  for  our  country  to
produce  the  well-trained  and  sufficiently  skilled  workers   that   are
fundamental to the  efficient  administration  of  Government,  as  well  as
business in our country, appropriate and relevant measures have to be  taken
early in our education system  to  ensure  that,  indeed,  we  produce  such
workers.

It is in  this  context  that  the  three-year  programme  for  professional
upgrading of 30 000 teachers, that will begin in July this year,  has  great
significance. It is important because our teachers are crucial to  the  all-
round efforts to ensure that young people are suitably trained  to  position
our country to face a myriad of challenges within the environment  of  rapid
advances in science and technology.
It is also urgent that the technical colleges and technikons  refocus  their
curricula in a manner that is in tune with our human  resources  development
strategy. The responsibility to create an informed and skilled workforce  in
our country, however, does not rest only with Government.

Seven years since freedom we have many individuals and  companies  that  are
taking extraordinary measures to end the marginalisation and  disempowerment
of the majority of our people. For example, the Tongaat  Hulett  group,  one
of the largest investors in manufacturing in  our  country,  is,  like  many
other companies that understand the challenges our country faces,  making  a
valuable contribution to black economic empowerment and employment equity.

The company contributes to black economic  empowerment  through  outsourcing
some of its activities and stimulating investment in small and  medium-scale
businesses, which either supply the company with goods and services  or  add
value to the group's products for onward sale. In the year 2000,  the  group
spent R400 million on initiatives in this area,  including  contracts  worth
more than R80 million awarded to black-owned  companies  supplying  services
to the aluminium rolled products plant.

 In the sugar division, approximately 4 000  hectares  of  sugar  cane  land
were sold to 54 black farmers in units of 70 to 100 hectares, and plans  are
under way for a second phase. This is over and above the important  training
that the group has given blacks, with the result that  60%  of  its  skilled
workers are black.

IBM South Africa, through a programme called ``Writing to Read'',  used  its
computer-supported instruction system to  introduce  20  000  black  primary
school children to English reading and writing. In addition, IBM's  KidSmart
program goes beyond the donation of computers to  classrooms.  This  program
helps children with their school work  and  removes  technological  barriers
by, for example, giving them access to the Internet.

Other  capacity-building  programmes  of  the  company  include  Reinventing
Education in South Africa; the Marang Project, which offers  the  unemployed
technical training; and the Andisa programme that  provides  an  environment
for the incubation of start-up companies until they are self-sufficient.  In
this regard, we are talking about start-up black companies.

Furthermore, there are many individuals that are selflessly contributing  to
the development of many of our fellow  South  Africans  and,  through  their
innovation and creative approaches, are giving us  much-desired  leadership.
Once such leader is Taddy Blecher, an  actuary  and  management  consultant,
who, together with other professionals, started  the  CIDA  City  Campus  in
Johannesburg.

This campus has 1 200 students from disadvantaged backgrounds from  all  the
provinces of our country. Students are on tuition scholarship  for  a  four-
year Bachelor of Business Administration degree.  The  institution  and  the
campus are run by  the  students,  who  are  empowered  to  do  all  of  the
administration work,  computer  maintenance  and  software,  admissions  and
registration, marketing and the  market  research,  computer  training,  and
even cooking for themselves. All of this reduces the cost of tuition.

The education offered is designed to make  these  students  relevant,  truly
empowered, integrated citizens and leaders that are skilled and equipped  to
build the South African economy and  society.  Taking  advantage  of  modern
technology, this particular school carries out tuition through  the  use  of
multimedia technology, including television, CCTV, video projectors  and  so
on.

We are also grateful  to  the  many  commercial  farmers  that  are  working
together with us to grapple with the many challenges of  the  transformation
of our society. In the  Free  State  province,  Afrikaner  farmers  such  as
Messrs Pieter van Vuuren, Gert du  Plessis,  Alwyn  Pletzen,  Koot  Pienaar,
Koot van Heerden and Willem Troon have done us  proud  with  their  work  of
training and developing black commercial farmers. [Applause.]
In the Eastern Cape around the  Elliot  district,  farmers  such  as  Messrs
Kleinboetie van Zyl, Mark Dobrowsky and Selby and Johan Vorster have  become
partners in the development of new black farmers who  are  beneficiaries  of
the Government's land  reform  process.  The  same  has  happened  in  other
provinces of our  country.  [Applause.]  In  this  context,  the  Government
unreservedly condemns the continued attacks on and  murder  of  farmers  ...
[Applause]  ...  and,  acting  together   with   the   farmers   and   their
organisations, will continue to ensure that these attacks and  murders  come
to an end.

We have given these examples to make the point  that  all  of  us  as  South
Africans have a responsibility to get down to the detailed work of  changing
our country for the better, consistent with the policies and the  laws  that
this House has adopted. Let us, indeed, unite in action for change.

As we opened Parliament earlier this year,  we  said  that  whereas  we  had
succeeded in our task of ensuring the necessary balances with regard to  our
macroeconomy, what  we  now  have  to  do  is  to  attend  to  the  detailed
microeconomic questions to achieve the necessary economic advances. In  this
regard I have already said that we will interact with our  major  companies,
in the first instance, to assist in ensuring that they succeed in  the  work
of further contributing to  employment,  economic  growth  and  development.
Naturally, this will include the state corporations.

 In this regard I would like to express my  deep  concern  at  the  unseemly
squabble that has broken out on issues  concerning  South  African  Airways.
This matter has to be brought to a close as soon as possible. The  board  of
Transnet will meet the Minister of Public Enterprises this Saturday. As  the
House knows,  in  terms  of  our  system  of  co-operative  governance,  the
Minister represents the shareholder in  our  relations  with  Transnet.  The
Government will await the outcome of this meeting before making any  further
statements on this matter.

Once again, I urge all  our  people  to  co-operate  with  Statistics  South
Africa  as  it  conducts  the  population  census  later  this   year.   The
availability of accurate  information  about  our  country  is  of  critical
importance as we accelerate the  process  of  change.  The  Government  will
therefore continue to pay close attention to this matter  so  that  we  base
our  actions  on  concrete  reality,  rather  than  faulty  information  and
distorted perceptions of reality.

We stand at an historic moment in the evolution of  the  African  continent.
We have entered the new century ready and prepared as a  country,  I  think,
to help to set the continent on an unprecedented  developmental  road.  Many
among  our  brothers  and  sisters  on  the  continent  have,  on   numerous
occasions, articulated the fact that the time has come for us Africans,  for
ourselves, to end the senseless wars, the  conflicts,  the  corruption,  the
poverty,  the  disease  and  underdevelopment   that   had   for   so   long
characterised the African experience.

From every country and among the mass  of  all  our  people  throughout  the
length and breadth of this vast African land  mass,  there  is  a  pervasive
determination to participate in deciding  the  pace  and  direction  of  the
renewal of  the  continent.  Through  the  Millennium  Partnership  for  the
African Recovery Programme-MAP, we  have  enunciated  our  guiding  plan  to
respond to the various African challenges.

Some of the key elements of this programme  are  peace,  security  and  good
governance. All of us agree that this is very important for all  of  us,  as
Africans, because the restoration of peace and stability is in the  interest
of the people of  this  continent.  Similarly,  it  is  to  the  benefit  of
Africans to ensure that we establish and consolidate systems  of  democratic
governance.

We have to attract the much-needed flow of investments into  the  continent.
As  we  all  know  very  well,  for  us  to  make  a   visible   impact   on
underdevelopment  and  poverty,  we  have  to  get  sufficient   levels   of
investment into the African economies. At the same  time,  as  Africans,  we
should, ourselves, do things in a manner that assists in lowering the  risk,
real or perceived, that is associated with investing in Africa.

For Africa to revive domestic  economic  activities  and  begin  to  compete
internationally, there is an urgent need to  diversify  our  production  and
improve access to the markets of the developed countries. In a  world  where
every  activity,  be  it  social,  economic,  political  or   cultural,   is
predicated on communication and information technology, it  is  urgent  that
we should ensure that there is adequate investment in the communication  and
information technology sector as well as other basic infrastructure.

Further, we are faced with the challenge of  developing  and  improving  the
financial systems of all our countries. We must also attend  to  the  urgent
matter of infectious diseases, including Aids. Similarly, the debt  question
has to be  addressed  with  a  greater  sense  of  urgency  as  a  necessary
condition for us to end poverty and underdevelopment on our continent.

Thus, the Millennium Partnership for the African Recovery  Programme  begins
with a pledge by us, as Africans, to end conflicts  that  have  ravaged  our
countries  for  a  very  long  time.  The  programme  contains  a  political
commitment  to  democracy,  respect  for  human  rights,  the  creation   of
conditions for peace and stability as  well  as  the  strengthening  of  the
mechanisms for the  prevention  and  solution  of  conflicts.  It  seeks  to
entrench systems of governance that will ensure the creation  of  sufficient
capacity for the African states to govern effectively.  It  is  based  on  a
firm commitment to end the poverty  and  underdevelopment  that  all  of  us
experience, and to place Africa on the road to sustainable  development  and
renewal  to  ensure  the  active  participation  of  the  countries  of  our
continent in the world economy.

A specific feature of MAP will be practical and implementable programmes  to
achieve the defined objectives  and  to  ensure  that  we  move  beyond  the
general to the specific. Necessarily, the  Presidency  has  paid  a  lot  of
attention to the elaboration of MAP and will  continue  to  be  involved  in
this work, to make our own contribution as a country to  the  historic  task
of the renewal of the African continent.

On  7  July,  it  is  planned  that  we  shall  launch  the  Integrated  and
Sustainable Rural Development Strategy, to apply to all of the  nodal  areas
that the Government had identified. This comes at the end of  detailed  work
that has been done to ensure that  we  translate  policy  into  a  practical
programme for the radical improvement of the lives of poor people  who  live
in our rural areas. [Applause.]

To begin the implementation of our Urban Renewal Strategy, we  have  already
launched the renewal process for Alexandra Township  in  Johannesburg.  Work
has already started in this township, once again,  based  on  very  detailed
work that has been done to elaborate a concrete programme of action.  During
the course of the year, we will bring other urban  areas  on-stream,  again,
as part of our effort to  make  a  decisive  impact  on  such  questions  as
unemployment, poverty and crime in our urban areas.

When we say that we should all get down to work to change  our  country  for
the better, we are urging everyone to unite in action  to  end  poverty  and
underdevelopment, to end racism and sexism, to reduce and  contain  violence
and crime in our society, to reduce ignorance and  disease,  and  to  create
the humane society for which the children of our  country  laid  down  their
lives on 16 June 1976.

The Presidency and the Government as a whole are  committed  to  sparing  no
effort in ensuring that, in a real sense, we accelerate the process  towards
the realisation of the goal of a better life for all. We  are  inviting  all
our people to join hands in  achieving  this  noble  and  urgent  objective.
[Applause.]

Ms B MBETE: Madam Speaker:


  We all constitute one human family.  This  truth  has  now  become  self-
  evident  because  of  the  first  mapping  of  the   human   genome,   an
  extraordinary achievement which not only reaffirms  our  common  humanity
  but promises transformations in scientific thought and practice, as  well
  as in the  visions  which  our  species  can  entertain  for  itself.  It
  encourages  us  toward  the  full  exercise  of  our  human  spirit,  the
  reawakening of all its inventive, creative and moral capacities, enhanced
  by the participation of men and women. And it could make the twenty-first
  century an era of genuine fulfilment and peace.

These words come from a declaration which  was  signed  by  President  Thabo
Mbeki on 5 September 2000 entitled ``Tolerance and Diversity: A  Vision  for
the 21st Century''. This declaration, which was also signed by the  UN  High
Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Mary Robinson, promotes a  forward-looking
thrust towards and beyond the United Nations  World  Conference  on  Racism,
Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance  which  will  take
place in Durban from the end of August to the beginning of September 2001.

This declaration goes on to say:


  We must strive to remind ourselves of this great possibility. Instead  of
  allowing diversity of race and culture to become  a  limiting  factor  in
  human exchange  and  development,  we  must  refocus  our  understanding,
  discern in such  diversity  the  potential  for  mutual  enrichment,  and
  realise that it is the interchange  between  great  traditions  of  human
  spirituality that offers the best prospect for  the  persistence  of  the
  human spirit itself. For too long such diversity has been  treated  as  a
  threat rather than a gift. And too often that threat has  been  expressed
  in  racial  contempt  and  conflict,  in  exclusion,  discrimination  and
  intolerance.

This debate offers us an opportunity to look responsibly at  the  issues  on
the agenda of the upcoming world  conference  in  the  context  of  our  own
national challenge to build a nonracial  society,  a  matter  on  which  our
President has given consistent and firm leadership.

I wish to link our own  debates  to  the  preparatory  debates  towards  the
conference. After all, we are part of humanity. Our experience here is  part
of the bigger human experience. I will do so not looking at  the  conference
as an event but seeing it as giving the world in general, and  South  Africa
in particular, a window of opportunity for introspection.

 On 29 May 1998 the National Assembly had a debate on the  important  matter
of reconciliation and nation-building. We remembered what we  had  enshrined
in the preamble to our Constitution:


  We, the people of South Africa,
  Recognise the injustices of our past ...
  Believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it,  united  in  our
  diversity.

We went on to say that we wanted to -


  Heal the  divisions  of  the  past  and  establish  a  society  based  on
  democratic values, social justice and fundamental human rights ...

In the first and second chapters of the Constitution, we go on to spell  out
these values, rights and  fundamental  principles  that  must  underpin  the
democratic and nonracial society we are building.  Although  I  specifically
mention  these  two  chapters,  the  whole   Constitution   elaborates   and
encapsulates a framework within which we should move in  our  daunting  task
of building a transformed South Africa.

In his challenging speech, the then Deputy President correctly  pointed  out
that the reality of everyday life in  South  African  society  is  that  the
material conditions on the ground have divided  us  into  two  nations,  one
black and the other white. This is a painful truth we must grapple with.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Nonsense!

Ms B MBETE: Not verbalising  it  will  not  make  it  go  away.  The  bigger
challenge, however, is how we who have been charged with the  responsibility
by the electorate propose and proceed to tackle the mammoth task  to  change
the miserable conditions of the masses of poor  people,  especially  in  the
rural areas, and the squalid, overcrowded urban areas.

In this task I must remind hon  members  of  the  President's  call  on  the
occasion of his state of the nation address in February 2001, when he said:


  We call on all people across the colour line to  dedicate  this  year  to
  building unity in action for change.

That unity in action for change is  something  we  need  especially  in  the
fight against racism in our society. If we fail in this, we  will  fail  our
people and fail our supporters and future generations, whom we owe a  legacy
that should ensure  that  our  divided  past  is  never  revisited  in  this
country.

The most lasting way of moving away from the past into  a  nonracial  future
is through the formulation of policies and implementation of  programmes  to
attack  the  many  problems  in  our  people's  lives.  It  is  through  the
transformatory legislation passed by this Parliament to  enable  our  people
and ourselves to do the things that need to be done all  over  this  country
at different levels and in diverse aspects of social life.

It is through being vigilant when discriminatory practices continue  in  any
state or public body, so the necessary steps can be taken to  correct  that.
It is also through continuing to talk about racism and not hiding our  heads
in the sand and wishing it away. It is only if we acknowledge the  challenge
of its continuation in our midst that we will find the courage to deal  with
it, however painful it might be.

The Durban conference will be the third such conference organised by the  UN
to  focus  on  racism,  racial  discrimination,   xenophobia   and   related
intolerances. Because it has been with humanity for many  centuries  and  is
so deeply entrenched, the legacy of racism has  not  been  overcome  by  any
country anywhere  in  the  world.  [Interjections.]  In  fact,  there  is  a
resurgence of  racial  discrimination  and  xenophobia,  especially  in  the
developed world. It is still a problem here in our country.

Only yesterday, refugees were taking stock of their  lot  in  this  country.
The truth is that the worst hostility and bad treatment is  mainly  suffered
even  within  African  communities  by  other  Africans.  There   are   many
foreigners with enough resources for them to fly to this  country  from  all
over the globe, some of them bringing organised crime. Many of them  do  not
suffer the daily humiliation suffered by people who  flee  poverty  and  the
wars of our continent. This means that we have a lot of work to do to  raise
public awareness on these matters. We must use  this  occasion  to  look  at
what we have done to enable ourselves to build a nonracial society.

 One of the most important constitutional provisions which  requires  a  75%
majority to amend is section 1, which  lists  nonracialism  as  one  of  the
fundamental principles on which the foundation of our  democracy  is  built.
Making it difficult to amend was a deliberate move to secure our  commitment
to protect future generations from the possibilities of  the  evils  of  the
the past.

This is the provision which captures the aspirations that were  the  driving
force of the struggle for liberation over the decades. It echoes the  spirit
of the Freedom Charter which says:


  All national groups shall have equal rights! The people  shall  share  in
  the country's wealth! The land shall be shared among those who  work  it!
  All shall be equal before the law! All shall enjoy  equal  human  rights!
  There shall be peace and friendship!

[Applause.] Section 9 of the Bill of Rights  is,  specifically,  focused  on
equality,  and  lists  the  basis  on  which  it  is  not   permissible   to
discriminate against other people. This section also enjoins us to  practise
affirmative action and to promote  the  achievement  of  equality.  This  is
referred  to  as  measures  designed  to  protect  or  advance  persons,  or
categories of persons, disadvantaged by unfair discrimination.
On the basis of the equality clause in the Bill of Rights,  this  Parliament
has since passed a law to help us  grapple  with  -  amongst  others  -  the
challenges of building nonracialism in our society.  This  is  what  is  now
called the Promotion of Equality and  Prevention  of  Unfair  Discrimination
Act.

In a schedule attached to it are ten sectors in which there is a  high  rate
of unfair practices that need us all to pay  special  attention  to.   These
are: labour and employment; education; health care  services  and  benefits;
housing, accommodation, land and  property;  insurance  services;  pensions;
partnerships, professions and bodies;  provision  of  goods,  services,  and
facilities; and clubs, sports, and associations.

An Equality Review Committee has since been formed to  advise  the  Minister
of Justice  about  the  operation  of  this  equality  law.  Its  membership
includes two MPs, gender and human rights  experts  and  civil  society.  In
order to truly exercise our oversight function on behalf of our  people,  as
members of this House, I challenge hon members to monitor  the  progress  or
otherwise that this society is benefiting from these efforts  that  we  have
made so far to address this problem. Other laws that have a bearing on  this
subject are: the Promotion of  National  Unity  and  Reconciliation  Act  of
1995, the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995, Chapter VIII and  the  Employment
Equity Act 55 of 1998.

On 20 March 2001, this House adopted a motion that declared the period  2001
to 2010, as a Decade for National Mobilisation  against  Racism.  There  are
many among us who fear dealing with  this  problem  and  feel  that  we  are
harping on it unnecessarily. They take every gap to try to dilute the  issue
by raising other problems to divert attention from it. [Interjections.]

Looking at the draft documents before the Durban  conference,  one  realises
that the whole world  is  admitting  that  this  is  a  complex  and  deeply
entrenched problem, but also that it has to be faced head on  in  order  for
there to be hope for peace and stability in the world and in our  respective
countries. [Interjections.] Under the section dealing with sources,  causes,
forms and contemporary manifestations of racism, the Draft  Declaration  and
Programme of Action of the World Conference against Racism says:


  We recognise and admit that slavery and the slave trade, other  forms  of
  servitude,  conquest  and  colonialism  were  the  primary  sources   and
  manifestations  of  racism,  especially  against  Africans;  recall   the
  historical fact that among the  most  hideous  manifestations  of  racial
  discrimination the African continent and diaspora have  suffered,  namely
  the slave trade, all forms of exploitation,  colonialism  and  apartheid,
  were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between
  colonial powers  for  strategic  territorial  gains,  appropriation,  and
  control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources.

This draft declaration is an outcome of international deliberations. We  the
South African public representatives, have a  particular  role  to  play  in
that we cannot, on the one hand, be talking about  the  African  Renaissance
and, on the other, tolerating all sorts of  dehumanisation  of  other  human
beings within our borders. The internal community looks  upon  this  country
as a shining example because of our successful transition from the  past  to
the democratic dispensation.

Njengoba  sizoba   nengqungquthela   yomhlaba   wonke   eThekwini   kusukela
ekupheleni kuka-Agasti kuya  esontweni  lokuqala  likaSepthemba,  esikushoyo
ngukuthi ukubukelwa phansi  kwabantu  nokubandlululwa  kwabo  ngokobuhlanga,
akuphele. Sonke  singabantu,  Akusho  ukuthi  ngoba  abanye  bethu  bemnyama
abanye  bemhlophe,  abanye  bexubile  futhi  abanye   benokhokho   ababesuka
kwamanye amazwe njengaseNdiya, bayizilwane. Le  nkinga  yobuhlanga  yinkinga
iNhlangano yeziZwe ekade ibhekene nayo, yikho kuzoba khona le  ngqungquthela
ezoba seThekwini.  (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[As we are going to host a world  conference  in  Durban  from  the  end  of
August to the first week in September, what we are saying  is  that  looking
down upon other people and racism should be  abolished.  We  are  all  human
beings. It does not mean that some of  us,  just  because  they  are  black,
white, of mixed race, have ancestors who originated in India,  are  animals.
This racial issue is a problem that the United Nations has  faced,  that  is
why we are going to have this conference in Durban.]

I see that my time is up. However, in closing I want to say:

Inga le nkomfa iza kuba seThekwini ingahamba kakuhle, kuba  iza  konganyelwa
nguMphathiswa wethu wezaNgaphandle, uQabane  uNkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.

Kambe ke kufuneka singapheleli  nje  ekubeni  sithethe  enkomfeni,  kufuneka
sibuye size ekuhlaleni nasebomini babantu, sibone ukuba baphathwa  njani  xa
besezibhedlele, ezivenkileni, emisebenzini, ezifama nasezibhankini.

Iingqondo  zakudala  maziphele.  Umntu  olibeleyo  ukuba  nguMzantsi  Afrika
omtsha  lo,  makavalelwe  -  ndibhekisa  kuThangana,  uMphathiswa  wezokhusa
noKhuseleko. [Uwelewele.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[I hope that the coming conference to be held in Durban goes very  smoothly,
as it is going to be presided over by our own Minister of  Foreign  Affairs,
Comrade Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.

However, we will need to go beyond the conference  deliberations  by  coming
back to the people on the  ground  to  see  how  they  are  treated  at  the
hospitals, in the shops, at the workplace, on the farms and at the banks.

Old attitudes should be dispensed with. Anyone who forgets that  this  is  a
new South Africa - and I am directing this  to  the  hon  the  Minister  for
Safety and Security - should be locked up. [Interjections.]]

Finally, the Draft Programme of Action of the World Conference ...

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, you are well over time.

Ms MBETE: ... calls  on  Parliaments  and  our  Parliament  to  monitor  the
implementation of the resolutions of the Durban conference.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, Mr President and colleagues,  I
am sorry that we do not have an eclipse of the sun or  Dr  Pahad's  birthday
more often. We might have  more  pleasant  presidential  speeches,  such  as
today. Perhaps we can also use the occasion today to have real  debates  and
not just read speeches to one another.

Let me start by saying this, that there is much in what the  President  said
today that I agree with. I think that most sane and  forward-looking  people
would agree with his speech and his sentiments.

The problem is that I have been in this movie  before  -  been  there;  done
that; got the t-shirt - and for seven  years  we  have  basically  said  the
right things  in  this  Parliament.  For  seven  years,  with  some  unhappy
exceptions, there has been a general acceptance of  what  the  problems  are
and there have been very severe disagreements about  how  to  resolve  them.
But for seven years as well, we have literally incapacitated  the  machinery
of state, at the very moment that we expect the most  of  it.  Then  we  are
surprised, and that is the reason the President has to say today: "The  real
task that lies ahead is implementation."

Actually  if  one  tells  the  truth,  oppositions  are  here  to  say,  and
governments are here to do.  [Interjections.]  And  for  the  Government  to
simply project forward and say we should do this and we  will  do  that,  is
simply not good enough. The hon member can say: ``Shame''  as  much  as  she
likes, but it is a great shame actually that we have not done more for  more
people in the position that they are in.

Let me say something as well, before I get on with my job that I am paid  to
do, which is to head the opposition, not to praise the  Government.  I  take
full responsibility for what the DA and the DP do and say.  If  there  is  a
racist act or a corrupt instance, where there  are  allegations  against  my
party or any of its representatives, then it is my  job  as  the  leader  to
ensure that it is investigated and, if proven, that action is taken  against
the perpetrators.

In the DA, as, I believe, in most organisations, the  buck  must  stop  with
the person at the top. That is the position of the opposition. I am  not  at
all sure whether that is the position at all times with  the  Government.  I
say this frankly and with candour because too often, in too  many  instances
and on too many occasions, the President - it is his budget  of  the  entire
year that is being  judged  today  and  not  that  of  a  single  afternoon,
extraordinary though this afternoon might be for  the  reasons  mentioned  -
has to take responsibility for acts of governance and misgovernance.

There is a tendency in the Presidency with the President  himself  to  claim
that  his  critics  are  out  to  get  him,  that  legitimate,  lawful   and
constitutional opponents have an agenda, that there  is  something  untoward
about the agenda. Let me quote a recent example. On 8 February 2001,  in  an
interview the President gave with Anthony Sampson, he said, and I quote:


  Those South Africans think it is their duty to go  around  the  world  to
  paint the bleakest possible picture of our country, to see themselves  as
  the opposition to the Government.  They  want  to  demonstrate  that  the
  Government is failing, and is useless and corrupt,  with  thugs,  thieves
  and incompetent ...

I have never used such strong language but the President did -


  ... and having done all that, they say: Why is this Government failing to
  attract foreign investment?

Before I answer that question, let me say I actually think, with respect  to
the Deputy Speaker, Ms Mbete, that it is not  throwing  R100  million  at  a
conference on racism or denouncing the self-evident evils of  slavery  which
is going to attract investment to this country, which  is  going  to  change
and alter the lives of people and build ladders out of poverty.

I believe that the very disjuncture of this  Government  is  illustrated  by
the difference between the speech of the President this  afternoon  and  the
first ANC speaker  afterwards.  The  President  looks  forward;  the  Deputy
Speaker looks backwards. [Interjections.] I would  challenge  the  President
to take the Deputy Speaker's speech and have  a  discussion  with  President
Bush when he meets him next month, and see how he responds to that  sort  of
sentiment, and whether that, in fact, engages the kind of countries  of  the
world that we want to be involved with. [Applause.]

If one  sees  one's  critics  as  racists  and  counter-revolutionaries  and
unpatriotic  hypocrites,  as  the  Deputy  Chief  Whip  did   yesterday   in
Parliament, then, of course, they have no moral standing. They are  actuated
by bad faith and they have no case that needs to be answered. But I  put  it
to Parliament, I put it to the hon the President, that it is precisely  when
one does that that one actually shrugs  off  responsibility.  And  when  one
does that it compounds rather than resolves the many crises  and  challenges
that we  face  as  a  nation,  because  the  President,  self-evidently,  is
President of the whole of South Africa.

I believe that if we want the people of South Africa to take  responsibility
for their own lives then we  need  to  lead  by  example,  and,  instead  of
attacking everyone and everything, the Government should get on and  do  its
own job.

The persistent theme from the Government benches - and I regret to say  from
the President from time to time - is that the opposition is guilty  of  bad-
mouthing and unpatriotic behaviour. [Interjections.]  ``Yeah!  Yeah!''  they
say. Will, I suggest that  the  Government  ought  to  look  in  the  mirror
sometimes. Let us only look at the events in  this  House  and  around  this
House last week, while the hon the President was on a very successful  visit
to Britain. We had the ``Mutt and Jeff'' show in Parliament on  Tuesday,  or
more properly the ``Saki and Jeff''  show.  On  Wednesday  the  Minister  of
Health, Dr Doolittle as she is becoming known, announced yet  again  a  non-
Aids treatment policy for the nation. Then on Friday we had  ``Smart  Alec''
from London directly contradicting what the Minister for Public  Enterprises
had said, and just  to  round  off  the  week  we  had  some  tomfoolery  on
Saturday. [Laughter.]

 The Government can surround itself with loyalists and it can  find  enemies
wherever it looks; it can  look  for  people  to  blame  and  scapegoats  to
pillory. That might be good politics, but I put it to the hon the  President
that it makes for very bad governance. Let  me  say,  while  the  complaints
that are made by the people are, basically, that the Government  has  failed
on the ground, it looks as though, in many ways, Nemesis has flown  in  from
above in the form of the debacle at South African Airways.

Let me say immediately that I appreciate the courtesy and  the  very  prompt
response I had  from  the  President  in  response  to  questions  I  raised
yesterday with him about  South  African  Airways.  I  would  say  that  his
response, which he no doubt will elaborate upon tomorrow, that  he  was  not
involved in any discussion with Mr Andrews or in any  discussion  about  the
remuneration or other elements of his contract, completely contradicts  what
Mr Saki Macozoma said in Business Day yesterday, but perhaps  that  will  be
resolved in the fullness of time.

I would also say that the goings-on at South African  Airways  and  Transnet
almost make an opposition's role completely superfluous. I am not  sure  who
I should give my salary cheque to this month,  Mr  Radebe  or  Mr  Macozoma,
because both of them have done  more  damage  to  this  Government  and  its
reputation than anything that I could do in all the conspiracies I am  meant
to be engaged in.

But let me immediately deal with that. Mr Macozoma defends  his  actions  or
his inactions on a very simple basis. He  says:  ``I  am  a  patriot.''  And
presumably in the name of patriotism, Mr Macozoma  circumvented  the  tender
procedures with which every Government department has to comply.  He  turned
Transnet into a poster pin-up of how not to run a business, of  how  not  to
privatise an enterprise. At every turn  he  has  invoked  the  name  of  the
President, and yet the  origins  of  this  debacle  lie  with  the  previous
Minister, Ms Sigcau, who announced in Parliament on 6  September  1995  that
she was going to  turn  parastatals  ``into  engine  rooms  for  affirmative
action''.

In those same heady days Mr Macozoma announced that his  main  task  was  to
transform  Transnet  and  rid  it  of  what  he  called,  its  ``Broederbond
culture''. Well, he certainly did that. He did that by importing  the  worst
aspects of cowboy capitalism and robber baron corporate ethics  -  all  done
in the name of transformation and with a splendid  disregard  for  the  very
Constitution this Government claims to champion.

I mention this because when, at critical stages - going back to  the  former
minister's policy at Transnet, in respect of the appointment of Mr  Macozoma
and his fitness to lead the organisation, in respect of Mrs  Louise  Tager's
corporate governance - those issues were raised and hon members such as  the
hon Taljaard asked for details of Mr Andrews's salary, we were  met  with  a
denial, abuse and a stonewall. [Interjections.]

But I believe that if the Government had engaged the opposition in 1995  and
1996, we might not be sitting with the situation in  2001.  [Interjections.]
I believe that,  going  from  the  SAA  to  another  instance  of  corporate
governance, we can look at the arm deal, about which  the  President  had  a
lot to say earlier this year  but  was  completely  silent  this  afternoon,
because I think this  symbolises  the  Government's  failure  to  deal  with
corruption and to grow the economy.

Both instances and both factors are centre stage  here.  It  is  quite  true
that the President might care to deal with this, that, as  he  reminded  us,
he chaired the Cabinet's subcommittee which signed off  South  Africa's  now
R50 billion and rising arms deal. Apparently the same arms subcommittee  was
warned of serious repercussions for the country's  economy  by  going  ahead
with the deal in the form it was signed off in. [Interjections.]

Well, if I am distorting the facts, the hon Minister must come  and  present
the facts, because he keeps changing the  story.  [Interjections.]  That  is
the problem. [Interjections.] Smart Alec keeps changing  the  story  because
he is very smart. We see that the  Government  was  told,  apparently,  that
there was a severe economic impact from this, and that there were  going  to
be all kinds of questions raised about the  offset.  The  hon  Minister  who
came before this Parliament was very selective and very distorting,  to  use
Mr Erwin's felicitous phrase about those facts at the time.

 It is strange, with nothing to hide  about  this  arms  deal  to  quote  Mr
Andrew Feinstein who I see is not  speaking  this  afternoon.  To  quote  Mr
Feinstein: ``The Government carries on as though it does have  something  to
hide in this matter.'' [Interjections.]

And what they have done in the process is simply to vandalise Parliament  to
strongarm its committee and even its own members.  And so if we are to do  a
proper audit, and the President did refer to it in  passing  in  his  speech
this afternoon, but only glancingly, I believe that it  is  the  failure  to
address crime which remains the worst indictment against this Government.

Before we have patriotism invoked, once  again,  to  try  to  ward  off  the
argument without addressing it, I believe members  of  the  Government,  and
South Africans generally, are familiar with the  surname  Nzo.  It  is  very
interesting what Dr Ike Nzo,  the  son  of  the  late  Minister  of  Foreign
Affairs, said:


  The criminals and criminality, unique to South Africa have dealt  a  huge
  blow to my sense of patriotism. I am now at the point in my life where  I
  am astonishingly contemplating emigrating or going back into exile.
[Interjections.] Those words were not said by a supporter of  the  DA,  they
were not said by someone who came from an unliberated background; they  were
said by one of the ANC's own.

Instead of dealing with the problem, instead of tackling  the  issues,  what
does the Government do? It sends into the Ministry of Safety and Security  a
buffoon, a blusterer and a bully to go and fix it. On the subject  of  being
a bully, may I suggest to the hon the Minister of Safety and  Security  that
he should bully the Portuguese and imaginary coup plotters  a  little  less,
and start bullying the criminals rampaging  through  our  country  a  little
more. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Order! Hon Mr Leon, will you please take a seat?

Dr Z  P  JORDAN:  Madam  Speaker,  I  rise  on  a  point  of  order:  Is  it
parliamentary to refer to a member  of  this  august  House  as  a  buffoon?
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! I do not know of a precedent, but I would  suggest  that
it  is  insulting  to  a  member  and  therefore  we  should  not  use   it.
[Interjections.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: The real issue that stands before us,  is  the
whole question of poverty  and  jobs.  That  is  really  what  divides  this
country: those who are in jobs and those who are out of jobs, those who  are
living in poverty and those who are not. To  me  the  real  national  crisis
that we face, is that we have a growth rate of only 3% to 3,5%. That is  the
national crisis that this country faces.

If we wish to create ladders out of poverty, if we wish to create a  million
jobs for the unemployed, we  need  ask  only  three  questions:  How  do  we
convert our growth rate to 6%, 7% or 8%?  What  are  the  structural  issues
that keep people poor? How do we attract foreign direct investment?

Unless and until we - the Minister of Safety and  Security  can  bluster  as
much as he  likes;  he  should  solve  crime  and  not  interfere  with  the
opposition - address those questions  and  subordinate  everything  else  to
answering those questions, then we will fail as a  nation.  When  we  answer
those questions we will succeed as a nation.

The hon the President started by quoting 16 June. It was not  a  DA  member,
but the former president of the ANC, Mr Oliver Tambo, who said:


  It is our responsibility to break down barriers of division and create  a
  country where all will be neither white nor black,  just  Africans,  free
  and united in diversity.

I believe that that ideal, which is a genuine form of patriotism,  to  which
the Minister of Foreign Affairs should not  object,  is  exactly  what  this
House, this Parliament and South Africa should commit itself  to,  not  just
in word, but in deed as well. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  President,  hon  Deputy
President,  hon  members  of  this  House,  I  would  like   to   start   by
congratulating the President on his 59th birthday. We, as  seniors,  welcome
him to the club of senior citizens. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Every year the Vote of the President's Ofice offers us  the  opportunity  to
reflect on the institution of  the  Presidency  itself.  I  feel  that  this
year's reflection must be inspired by  a  profound  sense  of  patriotism  -
which I know means different things to different people  -  which  overcomes
divisions and problems, and unites us as South Africans.

 The institution of  the  Presidency  is  essential  to  provide  the  moral
leadership that our country desperately needs to  overcome  many  challenges
confronting it,  ranging  from  unemployment  to  criminality,  insufficient
service delivery and the pressing demands of our  people.  As  we  have  all
heard from the President's speech, the unifying moral  leadership  emanating
from the Presidency is essential to the functioning of our  institutions  of
Government.

Our Republic is based on the principle of  an  executive  President  who  is
both  the  Head  of  State  and  the  Head   of   Government.   During   the
constitutional negotiations, I advocated that the offices  of  the  Head  of
State and the Head of Government be split. But, of course, I know  that  the
media were saying that I wanted to be the Prime  Minister  of  the  country,
when I said that. [Laughter.]

Even though they are now merged into one, we should keep  them  separate  in
our own minds.  At  times  criticism  may  be  moved  towards  the  Head  of
Government,  which  the  President  is,  in  respect  of   policy   matters,
shortcomings, controversies or incidents, all  of  which  are  part  of  the
democratic debate.

However, at times we must also come together as South Africans,  recognising
the shared value of the institution of Head of State  and  under  its  moral
leadership. In the end, the performance of the Head of  State  lies  in  his
capacity to  unify  the  nation  above  and  beyond  political,  social  and
cultural divisions, and to remain beyond personal reproach and criticism.

In fulfilling both Offices, our President has often  shown  this  difference
of roles which has emerged clearly in the pride which  we  all  took  during
his recent successful trip to the United Kingdom, in  which  he  represented
our country, first and foremost, as our Head of State.

I must digress and say that some of us were quite  disappointed  when,  less
than two days after the President's return, we had the threats  from  Cosatu
that there would be a two-day stayaway because  they  were  opposed  to  the
privatisation of state assets. I can assure members,  as  a  member  of  the
Cabinet who is not a member  of  the  ANC,  that  this  Government  is  very
serious about privatisation. [Applause.] In the  past  two  weeks,  we  have
been wrestling seriously with this issue of privatisation.  [Interjections.]


Our Cabinet comprises two political parties, as hon  members  know,  working
together on a difficult and still very  uncertain  path  of  reconciliation.
Within its dynamics, tensions and  disagreements  are  bound  to  occur,  in
respect of which the President has to act as our Head of  Government.  There
are matters that have triggered  my  disagreement,  for  instance,  some  of
which, like the issue of traditional leadership, have been brought out  into
the open while others have become part of the dialectic interaction  between
the two parties that are represented in the Cabinet.

There are many things that are of grave and serious concern to me,  such  as
the  lack  of  integrity  and  the  corruption  surfacing  in  many  of  our
institutions, and the difficulties which we are  experiencing  at  times  in
consolidating the rule of law so that it may  finally  and  forever  replace
the rule of man.

In this respect people may disagree with our President, on how the  Head  of
Government deals with some of  these  issues.  But,  I  am  concerned  about
people talking so extensively and openly about a leadership crisis  in  this
country, images of a besieged Presidency, the  damage  that  that  does  and
that the same people squeal about the fact that people  abroad  do  not  see
our country as a safe destination for investment.

I think we need to be careful not to sink in problems of our own making.  No
head of government can be without blame or blemish, especially in a  country
as difficult and complex to govern as South Africa. Even as  a  Christian  I
remember that my Lord Jesus Christ  himself  said  he  was  not  good.  When
someone said he was good, he said no one was  good,  not  even  himself.  No
head of government can be above criticism  and  accountability,  and  immune
from political attacks. In the past two years, our Head  of  Government  has
been embroiled  in  several  controversies,  highlighting  our  Government's
challenges.

 Among these are the  political  and  economic  crisis  in  Zimbabwe,  which
underpins fundamental questions on our foreign policy role on  the  rest  of
the continent; our policies  to  fight  the  Aids  pandemic,  which  is  the
greatest social and economic emergency facing  our  country;  the  issue  of
traditional leadership, which still remains  unresolved,  in  spite  of  its
destabilising, explosive potential in our rural areas; the  question  raised
in respect of the investigation  into  the  arms  procurement  scandal;  our
policies to fight crime which have  not  yet  stopped  the  growth  of  this
scourge;  the  uncertainty  in   the   finalisation   of   the   immigration
legislation; allegations that the Police Force has  been  used  to  restrain
leadership  challenges  internal  to  political  parties;   allegations   of
political interference in the granting of the third cellular  communications
licence; acrimonious and potentially divisive debates which  have  polarised
racial tensions;  and  other  controversies,  as  we  have  just  seen  this
afternoon.

It is possible that many of these controversies  will  continue  and  indeed
that new ones will arise. However, I wish to  say  in  this  debate  on  the
Presidency's budget that criticism  should  respect  the  integrity  of  the
function of the Head of State. At this juncture in our  country,  we  cannot
afford to personalise critical attacks on the President, and we all need  to
make an earnest effort to build a renewed moral  leadership  with  which  we
can all identify as South Africans and be  comfortable.  If  this  does  not
happen, the country may come apart at the seams.

Moral leadership is the one  thing  our  country  and  our  institutions  of
Government cannot do without, and remains the  greatest  challenge  that  we
hope  the  Presidency  will  continue  to  pursue  in  the  years  to  come.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Speaker, President  of  the  Republic  of  South
Africa, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, we  have  just  begun  the  third
year of our current democratic Government and are nearing the end of a  very
intensive session of Parliament. One of the  issues  that  has  increasingly
come to the fore in  our  recent  debates  in  this  Chamber  has  been  the
relationship between the executive and Parliament.

Our Constitution  provides  for  the  accountability  of  the  executive  to
Parliament and the need for  parliamentary  oversight  over  the  executive.
However,  ours  is  a   new   democracy,   our   internationally   acclaimed
Constitution is barely five years old and we cannot expect all issues to  be
absolutely and totally defined within such a short space of time.

We are still in the transformation phase. Whilst the principles  are  clear,
we need to accept that it will take some time for us  to  develop  a  common
understanding of the system, given our different political backgrounds.

The understanding of some of our colleagues in  this  Chamber  is  that  the
accountability of the executive  to  Parliament  means  that  the  executive
cannot  point  out  shortcomings  in  the  oversight   work   conducted   by
Parliament, or be critical of the manner in which it has  been  done.  There
is also a perception that the  executive  does  not  fully  appreciate  this
necessary role of Parliament.

I really believe that  people  who  hold  such  concerns  misunderstand  the
nature of our democracy. No sphere  of  government  is  infallible,  and  if
mistakes are made, it is entirely within the rights  of  other  spheres  and
levels of power to point this out. This may lead to tensions, but  there  is
no  reason  why  such  interaction  should  not  be  healthy  in  a  vibrant
democracy.

Whilst our parliamentary legacy  may  have  a  number  of  features  of  the
Westminster system, it is important that we respect the  uniqueness  of  our
own South African political dispensation. Our Constitution  was  forged  out
of many long years of oppression and struggle, and  was  further  influenced
by the nature of the final political settlement in our country.

We value and cherish this democracy, as we sacrificed for it with our  blood
and sweat. I would therefore like to assure members of this House  that  the
executive has no intention of  undermining  Parliament.  If  anything,  this
executive will fight anyone who tries to undermine this provision.

 As Leader of Government Business, one of my responsibilities is  to  ensure
that legislation arrives  from  the  executive  in  a  co-ordinated  manner.
Legislative  programmes  of  Ministers  arise  from  the  decisions  of  the
relevant Cabinet committees and, ultimately, Cabinet.

At the beginning of  each  year,  Ministers  indicate  the  Bills  that  are
scheduled to come before Parliament and the dates by which  this  is  likely
to happen. The complexity of many of  the  pieces  of  legislation  and  the
rigour of the  consultation  process  sometimes  throw  the  timetable  out.
However, if Bills do not meet the deadlines set by Parliament, requests  for
fast-tracking are not sympathetically received. This is done to  ensure  the
smooth running of the legislative programme.

Hon members will note that only one Bill has been  fast-tracked  this  year,
namely  the  Criminal  Procedure  Amendment  Bill,  which  was  fast-tracked
yesterday in terms of the decision of  the  committee.  This  Bill  did  not
arise from the executive  but  from  one  of  the  portfolio  committees  of
Parliament.

Members will also recall that in the  first  few  years  of  our  democracy,
Parliament was extremely busy in assisting with the  development  of  policy
and the passing of legislation. We  passed  534  Bills  in  the  first  five
years. In this, the second democratic Parliament, the  pace  of  legislation
has, to some extent, slowed down. To date, we have passed 101 Bills. I  hope
that Parliament can use the additional time that  this  provides  to  ensure
proper oversight over the work of the executive.

Committees of Parliament should  not  just  sit  when  there  are  Bills  to
consider, but  should  receive  regular  reports  from   Ministers  and  the
departments regarding the implementation of legislation  and  problems  that
may  be  experienced  in  this  regard,   as  well  as  the   execution   of
departmental programmes. An assessment of the success  of  these  programmes
should not just be based on the reports  given  to  the  relevant  portfolio
committees. We should also focus on the  first-hand  experiences  either  by
the  committee  conducting  on-the-ground  assessments,  or  by   individual
members of Parliament as part of their constituency work.

The people of South Africa expect Parliament to be the paramount  forum  for
debating matters of national importance. We have had  a  certain  number  of
such debates. I believe, however, that the content of these debates has  not
focused adequately on the programme of action that we  should  be  following
as  members  of  this  House  in  addressing  these  matters   of   national
importance.

I would also like to address the House on the  issue  of  clean  governance.
From 1994 we have made it  clear  that  we  will  not  tolerate  corruption.
Having said this,  this  problem  needs  to  be  contextualised.  Causes  of
corruption are complex and are rooted in the  specific  historical,  social,
political and economic conditions of  our  society.  In  essence,  apartheid
distorted good value systems and brought about a culture in terms  of  which
respect for human rights, life and property were drastically diminished.
When I addressed Parliament on 31 October  last  year,  I  called  upon  all
parties represented here to give  the  issue  of  moral  regeneration  their
urgent attention and to make it a priority in their constituencies.  I  said
further that we needed to mobilise our sectors of society  to  work  jointly
with us to eradicate moral decay. I would like to  repeat  this  call  today
and urge political parties to prioritise this important matter.

I am happy to report that this fight was taken a step  further  last  Friday
when the national anticorruption forum was launched at Langa township,  here
in Cape Town. This was an important sequel to  the  national  anticorruption
summit of April 1999,  when  the  Government,  through  the  Public  Service
Commission,  established a national anticorruption cross-sectoral task  team
to take forward the implementation of the summit resolutions.

The forum was established to advise on and  co-ordinate  the  implementation
of sectoral strategies for the prevention and combating  of  corruption.  It
includes representatives from  Government,  labour  and  civil  society.  In
addition, the transparency and accountability that have accompanied the  new
democratic order, have created  conditions  where  corruption  can  be  more
easily detected.

 It is not just the health of the spirit that we are  concerned  about.  The
physical health of our people is also important. It is in this context  that
the SA National Aids Council was launched  to  co-ordinate  efforts  in  the
fight against Aids. We did this, guided by the  knowledge  that  our  health
response should be holistic and focus on all elements  that  perpetuate  the
pandemic.

In a new development this year, SANAC has embarked on an outreach  programme
which aims to have its monthly meetings  in  different  provinces.  In  this
way, SANAC members representing different sectors are able to interact  with
various  provincial  and  local  anti-HIV/Aids  community  initiatives   and
programmes. These meetings also give SANAC members  an  opportunity  to  get
first-hand experience of the HIV/Aids situation at local level.
A programme of  sector  summits  is  being  implemented  together  with  the
provincial and community  outreach  programmes.  Already  10  such  summits,
involving more than 1 500 people, have taken place in the first half of  the
year and more are planned. Sectors participating  include  labour,  disabled
persons,  the  hospitality  industry,  youth,  women,  traditional  leaders,
celebrities, business, traditional healers and people living with HIV/Aids.

On the research front, the  SA  Aids  Vaccine  Initiative  is  working  with
international partners in search of  a  safe  and  effective  Aids  vaccine.
Currently, 250 South African scientists are collaborating with 120 of  their
international counterparts on this project.

We have also continued with our programme of international engagements  over
the  past  year  that  are  aimed  at  strengthening   our   bilateral   and
multilateral relations. In doing so,  we  are  guided  by  our  belief  that
sustainable development, in South Africa, cannot  take  place  in  isolation
from  developments  within  the  continent.  That  is  why  our  trade   and
industrial  policy  is  closely  co-ordinated  with   foreign   policy,   an
integrated effort in which the Presidency plays a leading role.

We believe that significant progress has been made in international  affairs
and that South Africans should be proud of the manner in which  our  country
has graduated from being an apartheid outcast to  a  serious  player  within
only seven years. Credit for this must go to our President, who  has  worked
tirelessly in fulfilling a promise made to  the  electorate  that  we  would
actively contribute to creating a better country, continent  and  world  ...
[Applause] ... thereby fully integrating our country into the  community  of
nations.

The South Africa-Nigeria Binational Commission has yielded results  at  both
the political and the economic level. Through  this  binational  commission,
the two largest and most powerful economies of the continent  are  enhancing
their co-ordination. A number  of  South  African  businesses  have  already
benefited from improved relations between our countries.
Strengthening the bilateral relations with important trading  partners  such
as  Germany  also  remains  high  on  our  agenda.  Early  next  month,  the
binational commission with Germany will meet in  Berlin,  on  2  to  3  July
2001. Good relations  have  also  been  established  between  several  South
African provinces and German federal states.

Turning to the continent, we are also mindful of the fact that there  cannot
be true African recovery without peace and stability. That  is  why  we  are
involved in peace initiatives in the Great Lakes region. We have,  over  the
past few months, been assisting former President Mandela in working  towards
peace in Burundi. It is not an easy process, but we are hoping  to  reach  a
solution soon so that Burundians can begin the process of  rebuilding  their
country.

I must stress that we have, during our  foreign  visits,  been  humbled  and
inspired by the manner in which our country is regarded. We are seen  as  an
example to the whole world that any political conflict can be  resolved.  We
have also been told that we carry the moral authority to intervene  in  many
of these conflicts. This was illustrated to me during  my  recent  visit  to
Colombia  when  their  government  requested  us  not  only  to  share   our
experiences of negotiations but also to  assist  them  in  their  effort  to
bring about peace with the guerilla movements that are opposing them.

 This shows how seriously we are taken by the world. The challenge  we  face
as elected representatives is to spread  the  message  to  our  people  that
there is a lot that they should be proud of in  their  country.  This  pride
also arises from the fact that we have,  over  many  decades,  stressed  our
commitment to ensuring that this country becomes a nonracist  and  nonsexist
democracy. This has been demonstrated by the very nature  of  our  struggle,
which was all-inclusive and open to all South Africans who  wanted  to  make
our country a better place to live in.

Hon members will also recall that the  principle  of  reconciliation  was  a
common thread that held together all those participating in the  negotiation
process in the country. It was further demonstrated by the manner  in  which
the interim Constitution  was  drafted,  particularly  with  regard  to  the
constitutional imperative to establish the  Government  of  National  Unity.
The long and demanding process of multiparty political negotiations and  the
establishment of oversight institutions make us confident that our  hard-won
democracy is solid and sustainable.

This principle and commitment to reconciliation is  still  a  common  thread
that guides our task of building a new nation. We remain  steadfast  in  our
pursuit of reconciliation. With the upcoming UN Third  World  Conference  on
Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia  and  Related  Intolerance  we  as
South Africans have a tremendous amount to offer the world  in  sharing  our
unique experience. Overcoming apartheid was truly  a  demonstration  of  the
triumph of human rights and the human spirit. That spirit lives  on  in  our
people and sees us through times of great adversity. That resilience,  which
has become  the  trademark  of  South  Africans,  also  inspires  us  to  be
tremendously creative and innovative as we work  towards  forging  a  common
nationhood and pride, and developing a new South African patriotism.

We have taken these first tentative steps but more needs  to  be  done  with
the challenges ahead of us. In doing so, we need to remind ourselves how  we
triumphed over what the world  thought  was  impossible.  Hand  in  hand  we
crossed that great divide, never allowing the other to  falter,  and  making
sure that all reached the other side - not unscathed by history,  but  whole
enough to take on the immense challenges which faced us as a  country  above
party-political considerations. On that journey we understood the  depth  of
the economic, political and social challenges we would  face  on  the  other
side, as we sought to reconstruct this beloved country of ours.

Our coat of arms, with its motto of unity in diversity,  is  a  reminder  to
all of us that we should all embrace  the  positive  and  good  that  exists
amongst us in our fundamental  task  of  building  a  new  nation.  In  this
process we should not forget about the challenges  but  tackle  them  boldly
and jointly. This will ultimately result in all of us taking  pride  in  our
South Africanness, developing and strengthening the  common  elements  of  a
South African nationhood and sense of patriotism. There is  a  ground  swell
of South Africans that are convinced, as I am, that what binds us  as  South
Africans is far more powerful than that which may divide us. [Applause.]

We are convinced and we know that a new nation, which we indeed are,  shares
the thread of common destiny. Let us nurture our young democracy,  allow  it
to grow and come of age,  keeping  its  central  spirit  strong,  giving  it
confidence in  its  ability  to  excel  and  cherishing  its  many  positive
attributes. This is the approach we advocate.  I  therefore  call  upon  all
South Africans to work together in ensuring that our ideals of  a  nonracial
and nonsexist democracy are realised. [Applause.]

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Madam Speaker, it was  clear  from  the  start  that
President Mbeki's term of  office  would  be  a  difficult  one.  The  first
Presidency was made much easier by the positive emotions and  goodwill  that
came about through the transition to democracy in 1994. People were  willing
to be patient with the new Government, to give the  ANC  the  best  possible
chance in Government. People were willing to wait.  By  the  time  President
Mbeki took over as President in 1999,  it  was  clear  that  his  Presidency
would be the one in which hard  realities  would  begin  to  dawn  on  South
Africans.

 As President in 2001, the hon  the  President  simply  does  not  have  the
luxury of relying only on symbolism and flowery rhetoric. The  realities  of
the country have dawned on all our people.  They  want  results,  they  want
delivery, and they want to see promises fulfilled. This is a tough  task  in
our country.

Where we sit, in the  opposition,  we  understand  that  South  Africa  must
succeed.  Poverty,  instability  and  social  discontent  are  in   nobody's
interest. We understand that prosperity and  a  healthy  democracy  are  two
sides of the same coin.
Over the past few years and especially under Mr Mbeki's leadership, the  ANC
has opted for, in some instances against  their  socialist  roots,  and  has
accepted the wisdom of a market-driven economy. We  still  differ  with  the
ANC on some issues, but  generally  speaking,  the  hon  the  President  has
positioned South Africa economically where it should be, that is,  in  terms
of policy and theory, although not always in practice.

In order to be successful with the economic  repositioning  of  the  ANC  in
Government, President Mbeki had to drag along a diverse alliance,  differing
on fundamental issues of policy. When President Mbeki became leader  of  the
ANC, he said, in an interview, that he could foresee a day  when  the  ANC's
main allies, the  SA  Communist  Party  and  Cosatu,  would  end  their  co-
operative links with the ANC. He added that when  certain  goals  have  been
achieved, the movement would probably be disbanded.  In  another  interview,
the  President  said:``The  ANC  will  one  day  break  up   into   opposing
ideological tendencies.''

On 4 February 2000, the hon the President  said,  at  the  opening  of  this
Parliament,  that  the  economy  and  our  standing  in  the  eyes  of   the
international  investor  community  cannot  be  held  hostage  by   elements
pursuing selfish and antisocial purposes. It is quite  clear  that  the  hon
the President  was  referring  to  these  alliance  partners,  and  that  he
understood that the ANC alliance is temporary, with a limited life span.

But in order to keep the alliance together in the short term,  a  calculated
decision was made to use the race card in  an  effort  to  balance  out  the
ANC's repositioning to the economic centre. [Interjections.] Using the  race
card to buy political affections and to appease people is one  of  the  most
dangerous things that can be done in  our  country.  Instead  of  trying  to
appease his old political allies,  the  President  should  have  looked  for
partners where he is now positioned.

The result of the President's strategy is not  a  balancing  act,  it  is  a
strategy where the two elements work to counteract each  other  and  against
achieving clear objectives. On the one hand,  the  President  has  lost  the
trust of the left wing in his alliance, he has  alienated  the  unions,  and
there is immense scepticism in some sectors of his alliance with  regard  to
his economic repositioning. On the other hand,  he  has  not  made  any  new
allies to replace those that he is  losing.  The  minority  communities  are
alienated by his racial rhetoric. [Interjections.]  The  business  community
never knows which Thabo Mbeki they will  see.  Many  in  black  intellectual
circles are starting to  express  doubts  about  the  exercising  of  racial
politics.

The time has come for the President not simply  to  sit  it  out,  and  just
think about surviving political storms and scandals. For  the  sake  of  the
country, the President  should  start  thinking  about  abandoning  the  old
trenches and moving the country forward. He should take his own  advice.  In
a speech at the University of Natal a few years ago he said the following:


  One should be young, not necessarily in years, but young in one's ability
  to break with the past, in one's capacity  to  remove  from  oneself  the
  shackles of old thinking, allowing oneself to be inspired by  the  notion
  that where there is no vision, the people perish.

The President should break with  the  past.  Many  people  who  saw  in  the
President the person to make true all of the rhetoric  of  us  being  a  new
South Africa, without the burden  of  the  past,  giving  substance  to  the
concept of a rainbow nation, are today bitterly disappointed.

Volgens ons is dit met reg, maar volgens hom dalk verkeerdelik. Die  publiek
se indruk van die amp van President is egter dat dit strompel  van  die  een
krisis na die ander: Vigs, Zimbabwe, SAL en die Andrews-aangeleentheid,  die
Jeugdag-stampvoorval en die beweerde komplot. Daardie indruk heers  nie  net
by die President se  opponente  nie.  Dit  is  ook  dié  van  sy  potensiële
bondgenote en van baie mense in sy  eie  party.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[According to us, rightly so, but according to him, perhaps wrongly so.  The
public's impression of the post of President is, however, that  it  stumbles
from one crisis to the next: Aids, Zimbabwe, SAA  and  the  Andrews  affair,
the Youth Day pushing incident and the alleged conspiracy.  That  impression
is not only on the part  of  the  President's  opponents.  It  is  also  the
impression of his potential allies and many people in his own party.]

For the sake of the country, it is important that respect,  credibility  and
dignity are returned to the Office of  the  President.  South  Africans  who
truly want this country to work have one wish  for  the  President  and  his
Cabinet, that he goes a month  without  a  scandal,  that  he  goes  a  week
without a racially divisive comment, that he goes a day  without  the  deep-
seated disinterest he often seems to have for all but his own inner  circle.


The President should be a government for all people. There is a   widespread
believe that the President tends to  surround  himself  with  yes-men,  that
those from whom he takes  advice  have  become  praise-singers  leading  him
straight into many of  these  difficulties.  Instead  of  avoiding  vigorous
debate with those who differ with him, he should rather engage us.  The  end
result will be a stronger South Africa.

A president is also judged by the  quality  of  his  cabinet.  Some  of  the
President's Ministers perform well, and there, as South  Africans,  we  want
to give credit to Minister Manuel,  Minister  Lekota,  Minister  Didiza  and
others. There are, within any cabinet, a number  of  key  portfolios.  In  a
country faced by as many challenges as ours, these portfolios take on  added
importance. The Justice, Health, and Safety and Security Ministers have  not
performed, and these particular Ministers have  failed  both  the  President
and the country.

There are just too many members of the President's Cabinet who behave  in  a
fashion that is unbecoming of senior Government leaders. They seem to  think
that bluster and arrogance are a  substitute  for  performance.  Ultimately,
the success  or  failure  of  the  Cabinet  is  the  responsibility  of  the
President. Of course the composition of Cabinet is the  prerogative  of  the
President, but in his ranks there are certainly  people  who  will  be  much
more effective in the current problem portfolios.

At his inauguration the President said that we could not sleep easy when  we
had poverty and unemployment, rape and murder, Aids and  racism.  We  agreed
with him then, and we still agree with those sentiments now. Many  of  those
problems were not of the President's making, they were inherited.  But  many
of those problem areas have got  worse, and the real question is: How do  we
as South Africans solve them?

Last Sunday we opened our newspapers - and there was  a  reference  to  this
earlier - to read more criticism of life in South Africa. The author of  the
article was brutally honest when he argued that:


  Criminals are going to cost this country much more  than  apartheid  did.
  Seven years into the new South Africa, the time has come for us  to  stop
  offering social and political excuses for violent criminal acts.

If this criticism had come from the opposition benches, it would  have  been
shouted down by the ANC  as  racist,  advancing  apartheid,  traitorous  and
unpatriotic, but the author was Dr Nzo, son of the late Alfred Nzo, and  one
of their own. Many South Africans hope that the President will  now  finally
respond to this cry from within.

The President has been entrusted with the Presidency of the country.  It  is
up to him to mould South Africans into a team to solve  these  problems.  Up
to now his approach has been wrong, dishing out blame and dividing  us  into
separate nations. The  only  way  for  the  President  to  be  effective  in
addressing those problems that he is  so  concerned  about,  is  to  say  to
people: ``I need your help. As South African patriots, I need all of you  to
take my hand.'' The  President  will  be  surprised  at  the  goodwill  that
exists, even amongst people who do not agree with him politically.
Yes, we all come across as individuals who take great joy  in  seeing  South
Africa stumble, some who are opposing him  and  some  who  are  in  his  own
alliance. But the overwhelming majority of  our  people  want  to  see  this
country succeed. Hardly a week goes by without the President himself or  one
of  his  Ministers  or  close  advisers  becoming  bogged  down  in   racial
stereotyping. The President attacked the criticism of his  handling  of  the
Zimbabwean issue on the basis of  white  racism,  notwithstanding  the  fact
that some of the most hardhitting criticism came  from  black  intellectuals
and black journalists.

In a recent interview in the British Guardian newspaper the President  again
ascribed to white  South  Africans  the  view  that  they  see  black  South
Africans as lazy, basically dishonest, thieving and  corrupt.  Maybe  it  is
time for the President to examine his own assumptions and prejudices.  I  do
not hold the view that blacks are  any  more  or  less  capable  than  white
people of  governing.  I  do  not  believe  that  intelligence,  ability  or
integrity is tied to colour, rather that it is tied to character.

When he, as the President of my country, chooses  to  betray  me  and  other
white South Africans as generally racist, generally  bigoted  and  generally
hateful, the President does more harm than he perhaps  realises.  Whilst  he
may score points with some people in  his  alliance,  he  loses  volumes  of
credibility in the eyes of those  who  matter  most,  the  countless  black,
white, coloured and Indian South Africans who  are  ready  to  move  on  and
ready to build a united future. Whether  we  are  coloured,  white,  Indian,
Southern Sotho, Tswana or Zulu, our hearts are just  as  South  African  and
just as patriotic as his. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, esteemed  President  of  the
Republic, Deputy President, hon members and fellow South Africans,  the  ANC
won with an overwhelming majority in 1999  on  the  mandate  of  creating  a
better life for all.

To us in the ANC the African  benediction,  ``God  bless  Africa'',  ``Nkosi
sikelel' iAfrika'', has always served as a connection and an  expression  of
solidarity, unity and sisterhood and  brotherhood  in  Africa.  It  is  this
ideal of our movement that informs our interaction with and  our  action  in
Africa.

The benediction cannot just be a prayer. It calls for unity  in  action  for
change. This is what the President has urged us  to  do.  This  is  why  our
President has engaged the world through institutions such as Davos, the  G8,
the EU, churches, businesspeople, trade unions and NGOs to  become  partners
in the creation of a better life for our country and in the regeneration  of
the African continent.

If we move from the premise, as we surely  must,  that  our  foreign  policy
reflects our domestic policy and national interest, then we indeed  need  to
contribute to the creation of a better world. The better life  for  all  has
its foundation in a nonracial and nonsexist society.
Our contribution internationally should be the  elimination  of  racism  and
sexism, and the creation  of  a  world  that  is  peaceful,  democratic  and
prosperous, a world where no child goes to bed  hungry,  where  every  child
goes to school and has access to health services, a world where no woman  is
driven to prostitution as a means of survival.

Our starting point is at home in South  Africa,  and  on  the  continent  of
Africa. Inspired by our shared values of Ubuntu, and guided  by  the  slogan
of our founding fathers and mothers:  Mayibuye iAfrika, we  have  sought  to
work with others in  the  continent,  to  change  ours  into  a  truly  free
continent.

As a result - to Mr President - today we are hosting a team of  Rwandese  in
pursuit of the work of the joint  commission,  in  the  conviction  that  we
cannot let that small, beautiful country deal  with  the  aftermath  of  its
genocide on its own. We must extend a hand of friendship and contribute,  in
whatever modest way we can, to the rebuilding of  their  nation,  in  a  way
that will ensure that genocide never revisits Rwanda.
For the same reason, we have chosen the  route  that  we  have  in  Zimbabwe
because we are convinced that it will contribute, eventually,  to  a  better
Zimbabwe, rather than the route that will  plunge  Zimbabwe  into  a  deeper
crisis. Though the President has been subjected to virulent  opposition,  he
has persevered because his approach will finally  bear  fruit,  rather  than
get him short-term praise from those who want to plunge Zimbabwe into  utter
chaos and do not have the responsibility  to  deal  with  the  consequences.
Those who have stood on the mountaintop and shouted insults at  Zimbabwe  as
a country and President Mugabe have not produced any solution.

It is for this reason that former President Mandela is trying  hard  to  end
the intractable conflict in Burundi. It is also for  this  reason  that  our
brave men  and  women  from  the  SA  National  Defence  Force  are  in  the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea and  Ethiopia,  to  contribute  to
peace in those countries. Indeed, this is  a  new  South  Africa  where  the
SANDF no longer sends a cold chill down people's spines, but is  seen  as  a
force that is working for peace.

At the close of the 20th  century  the  continent  was  characterised  as  a
hopeless, dark continent, a continent of  disease,  misery  and  poverty;  a
continent of wars,  refugees  and  underdevelopment.  This  was  partly  the
result of colonial plunder and  subjugation,  but,  in  large  measure,  the
result of the mismanagement of the continent during the Cold  War,  and  the
destabilisation policies of the apartheid South Africa.

We have declared the 21st century  the  African  century,  informed  by  the
determination of the African leaders to work towards  the  recovery  of  the
continent. Speaking  recently  at  the  SA  Economic  Summit  of  the  World
Economic Forum, Mr Tempelsman, the chairman  of  the  Corporate  Council  on
Africa, had this to say about Africa, and I quote:


  I have been travelling to this continent for just over 50 years now,  and
  rarely have I been  as  encouraged  as  by  this  generation  of  African
  leaders, both within and outside the Government and  within  and  outside
  this region. I see men and women who are  in  equal  measure  principled,
  pragmatic, and possessed of moral courage - the courage to act  and  take
  responsibility for such action. That the time has come is evident in  the
  evolving, tough plans  for  Africa's  reconstruction  that  have  rightly
  claimed the world's attention, and should merit the world's  allegiances,
  once completed.

The plan of recovery and reconstruction  of  the  continent  is  founded  on
shared values such as  democracy,  good  governance,  peace  and  stability,
sustainable, people-centred development and good neighbourliness. This  plan
will quantitatively and qualitatively be different from the  previous  ones,
because of the strong emphasis  on  partnership  and  unity  in  action  for
change.

Developing countries, including G8 donor countries in general, UN  agencies,
countries  of  the  South,  multilateral  and  financial  institutions,  the
private sector and civil society are all pledging their  commitment  to  its
success. Without these  partnerships,  of  course,  the  plan  will  falter.
Fortunately, there is clear and discernible interest and commitment  on  the
part of the partners to ensuring that the continent does indeed succeed.

We all have a duty and responsibility,  individually  and  collectively,  to
ensuring that the continent recovers.  As  South  Africans  we  have  to  be
humble and modest, and realise  that  we  have  a  lot  to  learn  from  the
continent, whilst we also have a lot to contribute.

In just over two months, delegates from across the whole world will  descend
on the shores of Durban to spend time grappling with how to  deal  with  the
scourge of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and  related  forms  of
intolerance. They have chosen South Africa precisely  because  we  ourselves
are seized with the mammoth task of  creating  a  nonracial,  nonsexist  and
tolerant society where the tapestry  of  our  diverse  cultures  will  be  a
source of strength and not a source of conflict.
It is opportune, as we enter the new century, that we look at the  past  and
acknowledge the injustices of the past, but find a way of closing that  ugly
and tragic chapter, and look at contemporary  forms  of  racism.  The  world
expects us to make a contribution to  this  important  issue.  Therefore  we
should work together and come  up  with  a  plan  of  action  that  will  be
implementable  nationally  and  internationally.   It   is   therefore   our
responsibility as members of this House to make it a success.

The rebirth of the continent and the elimination of racism also  demand,  as
the President said earlier today, the involvement  of  women,  both  in  the
development and the implementation of  the  plan  of  action  of  the  World
Conference Against Racism. If we are to achieve a better life for all and  a
better world for all, women have to be at  the  forefront  of  the  struggle
against both racism and economic marginalisation. We do this with the  clear
knowledge that women  bore  the  brunt  of  racism,  racial  discrimination,
sexism and xenophobia.

 As a  consequence  of  war  and  conflict,  women  have  been  turned  into
refugees, sex  slaves  and  objects  worth  trafficking.  Additionally,  the
feminisation of poverty has meant that women  constitute  the  bulk  of  the
poor of the world. For the attainment of the rebirth of  the  continent,  it
is critical that women play a key role. As that daughter of  the  continent,
Mrs Annette Mbayi, once said:


  The central role of women in social life is a fact of culture. She is the
  link which joins together the life of the family and society.  She  is  a
  source of production and of exchange of social and  cultural  values.  By
  her will alone, she can be a source of change and of  revolution,  or  on
  the other hand, she can be responsible for stagnation and retreat.

How true. There can be no rebirth of the continent without  the  involvement
of women. This task requires both the men and women of this  continent.  The
involvement of women can  only  make  the  continent  richer  and  the  task
easier.

Let us commit ourselves, on all sides of  the  House,  to  working  together
with our President, and the Presidency as a whole, to  bring  into  being  a
new Africa that occupies pride of place and should  become  the  destination
of choice for investments, the Africa of hope that challenges us to  be  the
midwives of her birth, to be the  warriors  of  her  renewal.  Out  of  this
Africa of old, the object of pity, must necessarily come the new  and  proud
Africa of tomorrow. This is 100  years  in  which  the  gentle  giant  which
Africa is must regain her former glory. We have the means  within  ourselves
to do that.

As lucidly and eloquently expressed by  the  ANC  in  the  Freedom  Charter,
South Africa shall work energetically to ensure  that  there  is  peace  and
friendship on the continent and, to  borrow  from  the  President  of  South
Africa ``where the silence of peace would be broken only by  the  voices  of
Africa's children as they sing of life,  peace,  liberty,  prosperity,  arts
and our human dignity restored''.

In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Leader  of  the  Opposition,
Tony Leon, for  being  able  to  understand  and  quote  that  hero  of  our
struggle, Oliver Tambo. It is, indeed, opportune  that  the  Leader  of  the
Opposition  should  understand  that  hero  of  our  land.  [Interjections.]
[Laughter.] The unfortunate thing is that the hon Leader of  the  Opposition
does not think or act in the way that Oliver Tambo urges all South  Africans
to act. Maybe it is because his  brain  tells  him  that  Oliver  Tambo  was
right, but his heart longs for the good old days. Maybe  he  needs  a  heart
transplant, but I do not think he will  survive  it.  The  crisis  goes  on.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy President and  hon
members of the House, our patriotic duty requires  that  we  spell  out  the
truth and not delude ourselves into thinking  that  all  is  well  when  the
contrary  is  the  case.  Ordinary  South  Africans  are  experiencing  more
hardships now than before. [Interjections.]

More people  are  walking  the  streets  without  the  prospect  of  getting
employment.  Vast  expenditure  on  overseas  trips  purporting  to  attract
foreign direct investment  has  not  been  matched  by  foreign  investments
flowing into the country.  Sacob  recently  expressed  its  concern  at  the
lacklustre performance of our economy as a result of a decline  in  investor
confidence and sluggish growth.

Privatisation and parastatal enterprises have largely failed to justify  the
large-scale retrenchments and the swelling of the ranks of  the  unemployed.
Few privatised enterprises, if any, have contributed to economic  growth  or
benefited the disadvantaged in any way. The  Government  is  insensitive  to
workers' opposition to the kind of restructuring of state  enterprises  that
has been embarked upon, which renders tens of thousands of workers  jobless.


Let us now look at  the  state  department  responsible  for  privatisation.
According to the Auditor-General's report  released  recently,  all  is  not
well in the Department of Public  Enterprises.  The  previous  Minister  has
still not explained the unauthorised expenditure of  R7,1  million  paid  to
consultants for the 1999 to 2000 fiscal year. In the  Department  of  Public
Works she has currently unauthorised expenditure of R30,5 million.

The new Minister of Public Enterprises has already incurred R18  million  in
unauthorised expenditure on consultants  as  well.  [Applause.]  He  is  now
involved in a public brawl with his former Managing  Director  of  Transnet,
Saki Macozoma, over a huge payout of R232 million to Coleman Andrews. It  is
common knowledge that  this  extravagant  contract  was  authorised  at  the
highest  level  during  their  time  in  office,  including  the  hiring  of
consultants  at  astronomical  costs,   which   has   become   the   present
Government's style of governance.

I submit that hon Minister Jeff Radebe misled Parliament and the  public  by
portraying himself  as  ignorant  of  the  settlement  package  received  by
Coleman Andrews, until it was revealed in  the  media.  [Interjections.]  As
the  political  head  of  Public  Enterprises  he  had  oversight,  and   is
ultimately accountable for all the  transactions  which  had  the  financial
implications that resulted in the  generous  settlement,  now  featuring  as
cause for concern in the media and his parliamentary speech. If he had  been
vigilant and conscious in his custodianship of the assets of his  portfolio,
he would have scrupulously evaluated Coleman Andrews's  contract  and  taken
corrective measures to prevent this excessive payout.

It is clear from the respective correspondence between  Philip  Brugizer  of
the SwissAir Group and the  hon  the  President  and  hon  Minister  Radebe,
during July and November 2000, that these senior politicians  had  different
agendas and were both well aware of what was going on at  SAA.  They  cannot
now feign ignorance and surprise when the sordid  facts  suddenly  come  out
into the open.

It seems that the Coleman Andrews affair is only the  tip  of  the  iceberg.
Much  more  is  involved  in  the  privatisation  business   of   parastatal
enterprises. For instance, in the  correspondence  referred  to  above,  hon
Minister Jeff Radebe, in his letter of 15  November  2000,  gave  the  Swiss
company only one month to exercise its 10% share call option of  SAA,  while
the President ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Mr P R MOKABA: Madam Speaker, hon Holomisa ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Is that a point of order, hon Mokaba?

Mr P R MOKABA: Madam Speaker, hon Holomisa makes a serious charge by  saying
that the Minister misled Parliament.  Could  that  be  taken  on  board  for
further investigation, because it is not correct?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Mokaba, he did not say the hon  the  Minister
deliberately misled Parliament. He said that very carefully.

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Thank you, Peter. Understand? [Interjections.]  [Laughter.]

For  instance,  in  the  correspondence  referred  to  above,  the  hon  the
Minister, in his letter of 15 November last year,  gave  the  Swiss  company
only one month to exercise its 10% share  call  option  of  SAA,  while  the
President in a separate subsequent meeting in Switzerland  gave  them  until
the end of 2001. Who is fooling who? [Interjections.] It appears that  there
is  a  conflict  of  interest  amongst  executives  in  Government  and  the
parastatal.

The current conflict over Coleman Andrews could well  be  an  expression  of
these divergent interests in the privatisation process.  The  Department  of
Public Enterprises is draining the state coffers. It must be  disbanded  and
its various functions spread out among relevant departments.

Although one of the Sunday newspapers suggested that the fight between  Saki
Macozoma  and  hon  Minister  Jeff  Radebe  derives  from  their  respective
ideological orientations - that is,  the  communist  versus  the  capitalist
position - the truth of the matter  is  that  the  eating  habits  of  South
African communists are the same as those of their  capitalist  counterparts.
[Laughter.] Sadly, the interests of the poor are sacrificed  at  the  tables
of conspicuous consumption in both communist and capitalist camps.

However, the South African communists are all cut from  the  same  communist
cloth. For instance, hon Minister  Fraser-Moleketi  has  had  her  share  of
doling out huge amounts of public funds to consultants. On the  other  hand,
she is retrenching thousands of public servants. As the Minister  of  Social
Welfare  she  was  responsible  for  withholding  expenditure  for   poverty
alleviation among the working class and the unemployed. [Interjections.]

The hon  member  Comrade  Jeremy  Cronin,  the  SACP's  leading  light,  was
prepared to disrupt the work of the parliamentary ethics committee in  order
to cover up the questionable conduct of hon  member  Comrade  Tony  Yengeni,
who refused to disclose his family's ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!  Hon  Holomisa,  can  you  please  withdraw  that
remark about an hon member?

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, which one? [Laughter.]

The  DEPUTY  SPEAKER:  Order!  The  remark  regarding   the   ``questionable
conduct'' of the hon Yengeni.

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, should I withdraw that?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Yes, hon member.

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, can you substantiate why? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I would like you to withdraw your comments  about
the questionable conduct of the hon Yengeni.

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, all right, I withdraw it.

Their comrade-in-arms, hon Minister Alec Erwin, the Minister  of  Trade  and
Industry, is driving globalisation and the Gear macroeconomic policy,  which
has impoverished the masses in this country. This indeed is a curious  breed
of communist. Comrade Joseph Stalin must be turning in his grave.

This pattern of total disregard for the interests  of  our  people  is  also
reflected in the developments which followed the  Defence  Review  of  1998.
This Review's budget was estimated at R9,7  billion,  and  was  subsequently
approved by Parliament up to 2006. The aim of  the  Defence  Review  was  to
reduce personnel costs through demobilisation in order  to  free  funds  for
capital expenditure. The R30 billion budget, which has now escalated to  R51
billion, has not been  authorised  by  this  Parliament.  The  investigating
agencies will have failed in their task if they do not establish the  source
and reason for the  departure  from  the  original  mandate.  That  original
budget had taken into account the  socioeconomic  demands  of  our  society,
hence the conservative figure.

These social considerations have been  echoed  by  President  Mbeki  in  his
discourse on the Aids pandemic debate. How do we explain this  surreptitious
escalation of the arms budget  to  R51  billion,  when  these  socioeconomic
conditions have not changed?

Every now and again we hear Ministers complaining  that  their  budgets  are
inadequate. Why do they support  this  extravagant  expenditure?  There  can
only be one explanation for this discrepancy. The escalated  budget  is  the
cash cow for the ruling party and the  sub-contractors  of  its  surrogates.
For example, there is a very disquieting feature in  this  arms  procurement
deal,  the  fact  that  former  Minister  of  Defence  Joe  Modise   induced
Government to  underwrite  the  Defence  Review  and  arms  purchases  as  a
national priority and, in  the  process,  formed  sub-contracting  companies
which earned him several billion rands, while he himself is  listed  as  one
of the main beneficiaries of the procurement.

This is  not  why  the  people  voted  this  Government  into  power.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]
Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Madam Speaker, hon President, hon  Deputy  President,  some
people have indeed been transformed. As I listened to the former speaker,  I
thought about the economic chaos and bad government in the former  Transkei.
[Applause.]

I am honoured and proud to participate in this budget debate. I  stand  here
as a liberated white African who has elected to join  hands  in  taking  our
country forward for the sake of our children and grandchildren. [Applause.]

I recall that the hon the President, on a certain ground-breaking  occasion,
described  himself  as  an  Afrikaner.   Owing   to   short-term   political
opportunism, the process  which  I  envisaged  failed  to  materialise.  The
failure by the Leader of  the  Opposition  to  make  a  single  constructive
contribution to this debate confirms that the DA has relegated itself  to  a
continuous negative role. [Interjections.]

The principled decision by some of us to join the ANC does  give  expression
to the sentiments of those who voted yes in the 1992 referendum, for  power-
sharing and a government of national unity in  1994,  and  for  constructive
engagement  and  an  inclusive   government   in   1999.   The   spirit   of
reconciliation and the  imperative  of  nation-building,  expounded  by  the
President's predecessor President Mandela, is still  alive  and  well  under
President Mbeki's leadership.

 My presence here today, as well as the warmth  and  empathy  with  which  I
have been accepted, is living  proof  of  this.  [Applause.]  Despite  being
ostracised  by  their  compatriots,  Afrikaner  trailblazers  such  as  Bram
Fischer, Beyers Naudé, Ben Marais, Danie Craven, Nico Smith and others  have
been vindicated by history. Today I would  like  to  pay  tribute  to  them.
Those many whites, in particular the Afrikaners who are  committed  to  this
country, have a pivotal role to play  in  the  Millennium  African  Recovery
Programme. Through the centuries in which our forebears were, amongst  other
things, persecuted because of their religion, we have been  able  to  create
opportunity out of adversity. Of course, mistakes  were  made,  and  we  are
ashamed of those mistakes. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Madam Speaker, I  do  not  have  time  to  take  questions.
[Interjections.]

That does not mean that we should sit and mope about those mistakes. On  the
contrary, we have for many centuries sworn our allegiance to Africa.  We  do
not keep a  backdoor  open  by  carrying  the  passports  of  our  ancestral
countries. We do not  participate  in  secret  debates  whether  England  or
Israel will be the best option. [Interjections.] No, as children of  Africa,
we will join hands to build this country and this continent. [Applause.]

Die grootste fout wat ons kan maak, sal wees om so na binne te keer dat  ons
polities sowel as ekonomies gemarginaliseer word. Daar is geen fout  om  vir
die behoud van ons taal en kultuur te veg nie. Deur dit  op  die  basis  van
politieke eksklusiwiteit te doen, glo ek  egter,  sal  teenproduktief  wees.
Politieke eksklusiwiteit word ten regte of ten onregte beleef as  'n  poging
om die bevoorregting van die verlede te perpetueer.

Die uitsprake van die nuwe leier van die VF is  met  belangstelling  gevolg.
Sy bereidwilligheid om deel van die oplossing  eerder  as  die  probleem  te
wees, word  waardeer.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Die  Afrikaner-tuislandgedagte  is
effektief deur die 1999-verkiesingsuitslag in perspektief  geplaas.  Mag  hy
die leierseienskappe toon om  sy  volgelinge  werklik  deel  van  die  Suid-
Afrikaanse nasie te maak.

Die President het tereg na die DA verwys as 'n onheilige alliansie.  Dit  is
beslis  die  bymekaarkom  van  onverenigbares.  Die  onverkwiklike   getwis,
rugstekery, knoeiery en ondergrawery binne hul geledere  is  die  voortekens
van 'n vulkaan wat wag om te ontplof. Dit is nie dat ek sekere  persone  nie
die pyn daarvan gun nie. Ek is net jammer vir die sovele  goedgelowiges  wat
weer eens om die bos gelei is, goedgelowiges wat werklik geglo het  dat  die
Nuwe NP nie werklik deur die DP verswelg sou word nie. Die DP-leier het  mos
gesê hy het 'n reddingsboei na  'n  drenkeling  gewerp.  Die  Ryan  Coetzee-
memorandum het verder lig gewerp op hierdie  diaboliese  plan.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The biggest mistake we could make, would be  to  turn  inward  to  such  an
extent that we become marginalised politically,  as  well  as  economically.
There is nothing wrong with fighting for the preservation  of  our  language
and culture. However, I believe that to do so  on  the  basis  of  political
exclusivity, would be counterproductive. Political exclusivity  is,  rightly
or wrongly, experienced as an attempt to perpetuate  the  privilege  of  the
past.

The statements of  the  new  leader  of  the  FF  have  been  followed  with
interest. His willingness to be  part  of  the  solution,  rather  than  the
problem, is appreciated. [Interjections.] The Afrikaner  homeland  idea  was
effectively placed in perspective by the result of the  1999  election.  May
he  demonstrate  the  necessary  leadership  qualities  to  truly  make  his
followers part of the South African nation.
The President justifiably referred to the DA as an unholy  alliance.  It  is
definitely the coming together  of  incompatible  elements.  The  unpleasant
disagreements, back-stabbing, scheming and undermining  within  their  ranks
are the signs of a volcano that is waiting  to  erupt.  It  is  not  that  I
begrudge certain people the pain of this. I simply feel sorry for  the  many
naive people who were once again duped;  naive  people  who  truly  believed
that the New NP would not really be swallowed up by the DP. After  all,  the
DP leader did say that he was throwing lifebelt to a  drowning  person.  The
Ryan Coetzee memorandum shed more light on this diabolical plan.]

I must add that the very need for an elaborate plan to sideline  the  leader
of the New NP boggles my mind.  His  trackrecord  is  self-eliminating.  The
Afrikaanse Studentebond, Jeugkrag, the  New  NP  -  he  has  led  each  into
oblivion. [Interjections.] Credibility is surely a fundamental  prerequisite
to preserving the integrity of a leader.

Accordingly, the  hon  leader  of  the  New  NP  owes  us  answers  to  some
fundamental questions. He pontificates on the virtues  of  modern  democracy
but, firstly, when his party receives a humiliating defeat at the  polls  he
does not follow the example of a Barak in  Israel  or  a  William  Hague  in
Britain, who tendered their resignations. No, he clings to his  position  as
though nothing has happened. [Interjections.] Secondly, democracy  is  fine,
as long as it does not apply to him. He and the leader  of  the  DP  do  not
allow the DA to elect its  leadership  in  a  democratic  manner.  No,  they
entrench their positions for two years. [Interjections.]

The New NP congresses have, furthermore,  to  this  day  been  denied  their
constitutional right to determine their own future  and  demise.  While  the
Speaker in Westminster is held as a  supreme  example  and  the  Westminster
style of confrontational  politics  is  acceptable,  winner-takes-all  à  la
Westminster is totally unacceptable.

I have had the honour of observing the hon the  President  in  this  Chamber
for five years as the  Deputy  President  and  now  as  the  President.  His
behaviour has at all times  been  impeccable.  He  has  been  courteous  and
respectful in  the  face  of  arrogance,  unprovoked  by  personal  attacks,
dignified and a credit to the high office he holds. [Applause.]

During recent times, certain incidents occurred which reflect shamefully  on
those who profess to carry the torch of  the  educated.  The  ``snake  oil''
remark by the hon Leon, the trashing  again  here  today,  the  hon  Douglas
Gibson stating on national television that the President had made a fool  of
himself, and the despicable speech by the hon Nigel Bruce in this Chamber  a
couple of weeks ago,  reflect  on  the  frustration  within  the  DA  ranks.
Undoubtedly,  there  a  number  of  DA  members  who  experience  the   same
embarrassment. Maybe the time is  ripe  to  re-evaluate  the  constitutional
clause  preventing  party  defections.   [Interjections.]   [Applause.]   My
assessment is that the new DA will consist of  substantially  fewer  members
than the sum total of the New NP and the DP. [Interjections.]

Met  inagneming  van  ons  geskiedenis  van  benadeling,   onderwerping   en
diskriminasie  is  versoening  in   ons   land   die   hoogste   prioriteit.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Dit  is  goed  as  die  adjunkleier  van  die  DA  uit  'n
hartsbehoefte die simbole en monumente van die struggle besoek.  Die  motief
daarvoor word egter bevraagteken met die opkommandering  van  partygetroues,
onder wie die  Nuwe  NP  se  eie  ``token  black'',  David  Malatsi,  en  'n
persgevolg.

Alle skyn van opregtheid word verder  vernietig  as  'n  mens  dink  aan  sy
optrede by verlede jaar se Nuwe NP-kongres in die Oos-Kaap. Die  uitnodiging
aan die ANC-premier van die Oos-Kaap om die  kongres  by  te  woon  was  nie
toevallig nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Hy het egter besluit om twee  uur  lank  in
sy hotelkamer weg te  kruip  om  nie  'n  platform  met  hom  te  deel  nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Considering our history of  disadvantage,  subjection  and  discrimination,
reconciliation in our country is the highest priority.  [Interjections.]  It
is a good thing for the deputy leader of the DA, acting on a deepfelt  need,
to visit the symbols and monuments of the struggle.  The  motive  for  this,
however, is questioned, with the conscription  of  loyal  party  supporters,
one of whom is the New NP's own token black,  David  Malatsi,  and  a  press
following.

Every semblance of sincerity is further destroyed when  one  thinks  of  his
conduct at  the  New  NP  congress  in  the  Eastern  Cape  last  year.  The
invitation to the ANC premier of the Eastern Cape  to  attend  the  congress
was not coincidental. [Interjections.] However, he decided to  hide  in  his
hotel room for two hours  in  order  not  to  share  a  platform  with  him.
[Interjections.]]

I am grateful that I  now  belong  to  a  party  where  internal  debate  is
encouraged, not stifled; a party which not only believes in  democracy,  but
also practises it; a party where the leaders are subservient to  the  cause,
and not vice versa; a party where integrity and compassion are  not  virtues
of theory, but of practice ... [Interjections] ... a  party  which,  through
its Freedom Charter, not only  acknowledges  our  right  to  live  in  South
Africa, but also provides a home for everyone. I would like to tell the  hon
the President that we will be at his side  in  his  endeavours  to  build  a
better life for all. [Applause.]

Rev K R J  MESHOE:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  President,  Deputy  President  and
members of Parliament, firstly, I would like to tender  my  apology  to  the
President for not being in the House tomorrow when he will be responding  to
inputs from members of Parliament. I have to  attend  an  important  meeting
that was decided on long before the parliamentary programme was finalised.

Secondly, I  want  to  congratulate  all  the  Ministers  who  responded  to
questions yesterday. Some of those who were not on the list that I  referred
to yesterday in my speech, of polite Ministers  who  answer  questions  with
dignity and respect, have made it onto that list, whilst others almost  did.
They were really dignified and subdued,  and  handled  themselves  well,  as
befits Cabinet Ministers. On behalf of the ACDP, I  want  to  say  to  them:
``Well done, and please keep it up''.

On more serious issues, I want to say how disappointed we  are  by  the  way
the Government has handled the multi-billion rand arms  deal.  In  1999,  we
were told that the whole arms deal would  cost  this  country  R30  billion.
Early this year, we were told that the deal would  cost  R43  billion.  When
the Minister of Trade and Industry  gave  his  testimony  before  the  three
investigating agencies, the Public Protector, the  Auditor-General  and  the
National Directorate for Public Prosecutions, he said that  the  final  cost
of the arms purchase would  only  be  known  in  18  years'  time.  This  is
scandalous, to say the least, because this is going  to  enslave  our  young
people to debt.  Government  was  neither  transparent  enough,  nor  honest
enough to inform the public they were incurring debt.

Although they knew from the beginning that the  cost  price  would  only  be
known in 18 years, as Minister Alec Erwin has said, they hid the truth  from
the public. To hear the Minister  of  Trade  and  Industry  saying  that  if
Government had put projections before the public much earlier we would  have
confused them,  is  seriously  undermining  the  public's  intelligence  and
ability to discern right from wrong.

Would the President tell us  if  the  perception  is  correct  that  Cabinet
refused to tell the  people  of  South  Africa  the  truth  about  the  real
ultimate cost of the arms deal? When members of Parliament  and  the  public
called for an investigation into allegations of  corruption  in  the  multi-
billion rands arms deal, it was the majority party that insisted  on  public
hearings instead of a private investigation by the  three  agencies  I  have
referred to earlier.

What surprised our people was that when the media  responded  to  the  ANC's
call for public hearings by attempting to broadcast  the  proceedings,  they
were prevented from doing so by the Public Protector. For  as  long  as  the
media is not allowed to  broadcast  what  is  being  said  by  those  giving
evidence, Government cannot convince the public that there is  no  cover-up.
It is the right of the public,  especially  taxpayers,  to  know  the  truth
about what really happened, and how many top people within the ANC may  have
benefited from this arms deal. All interested  television  journalists  with
their cameras and other broadcasters must  be  allowed  to  record  all  the
facts for themselves and then pass those facts on  to  the  public  to  draw
their own conclusions. Citing security and protection  of  witnesses  as  an
excuse for excluding broadcasters from the court proceedings is nothing  but
a lousy joke. We call  on  Government  to  commit  itself  to  transparency,
otherwise even the Public Protector would not have vindicated them.

 Lastly, I want to advise the President to seek mediation in  his  cold  war
with Mrs Madikizela-Mandela. [Interjections.] What the President did  on  16
June 2001 at the ANC rally  in  Orlando  was  undiplomatic,  unpresidential,
regrettable and disappointing. The President and Mrs Madikizela-Mandela  are
long-time comrades, and they should resolve their  differences  in  private,
and not in public, for Mr President will need her and her  supporters,  just
as she will need him as her President.

In conclusion, the ACDP wishes the President a happy  birthday.  A  pula  ya
mahlogonolo  e  mo  nele  matsorotsoro.  [Lehofi.]  [We  are   wishing   him
everything of the best. [Applause.]]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Madam Speaker,  Comrade  President,  Comrade
Deputy President, hon members, having listened to the opposition,  including
the hon member Holomisa, I must confess that I am no  longer  able  to  tell
the difference between ``buffoonery'' and ``tomfoolery''. [Laughter.]

The best intentions are in  vain  when  they  lack  adequate  structure  and
policy  formulation.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  our  efforts  in  the
Presidency are carefully structured, articulated and targeted.
May I draw the special attention of the House to the document  that  I  hold
in my hand, entitled  ``Integrated  Democratic  Governance:  A  Restructured
Presidency at Work 2000-2001''. It takes the form of a  report-back  to  the
nation on how the restructured  Presidency  works,  and  it  is  being  made
available not only to Members of Parliament, but also widely in the  country
and abroad.

It sets out in a clear and, I believe, convincing fashion important  matters
such as the challenges that faced the previous Offices of the President  and
Deputy President and formed a new structure of the Presidency. It  puts  the
principal role-players in  the  Presidency  in  context.  It  describes  the
administrative structure of the Presidency and Government entities that  are
related to the Presidency. It sets out  in  detail  how  the  Presidency  is
managed and how  it  is  integrated  into  the  general  Government  effort,
including the Cabinet and budgetary planning cycle and  how  the  Presidency
relates to the country at large. It emphasises the high importance  attached
to getting the message across, or  the  communications  side  of  Presidency
business. It lists and comments on the respected and  influential  work  and
advisory groups which have been set up by the President.  And  it  sets  out
the extensive and growing links that  the  Presidency  has  with  the  world
community and the President's active role in  critical  economic  and  other
forums. It makes the point that this heavy  international  involvement,  far
from being dilettantish, is  of  direct  value  to  our  domestic  position,
economically and otherwise. As the report puts it,  abroad  means  at  home.
The report is not a routine annual report,  though  it  carries  some  basic
information that is useful to the statistically minded.

If  we  are  anything  in  South  Africa,  we  are  a  people  committed  to
transformation. Our history held us in the iron grip of  no  change  for  so
long that we have had to make huge leaps to end its legacy. We  inherited  a
land with an enormous gap between the haves  and  the  have-nots.  It  is  a
bitterly difficult task to change that, as we freely admit.

Perhaps the greatest measure of how committed we are  to  transformation  is
seen in the way we deal  with  the  historically  vulnerable,  disadvantaged
sectors in our society, namely  women,  the  disabled,  children  and  young
people.  The  project  of  transformation  towards  a  nonsexist,  nonracial
society is integrally linked to the advances we do or do not make  in  terms
of eradicating the scourge of  racism  and  the  empowerment  of  women  and
people with disabilities.

Our Constitution enshrines our people's rights as equal with those of  every
other South African citizen. Their interests are inherently  linked  to  our
war on poverty and underdevelopment, and we cannot and should not deal  with
these interests  outside  the  constitutional  requirement,  to  create  and
maintain a nonracial, nonsexist and democratic society. We must  create  the
structures and we must  have  the  continued  commitment  to  empower  those
previously excluded and neglected sectors of our society. We  have  in  fact
convincingly changed this paradigm with regards to people with  disabilities
to the only acceptable basis, that we are dealing with a human rights  issue
and nothing less.

 With some modest pride we can take note  of  achievements  made  which  are
milestones on the road to that equality. The integrated national  disability
strategy, the national gender policy framework, the  national  programme  of
action for children and the children's media code, which flows from  the  UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as South  Africa's  accession
to the UN Convention on the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination
Against Women and our subsequent country reports, the next of which  is  due
in February 2002.

These are  critical  commitments  which  put  flesh  on  the  bones  of  our
constitutional intentions. We must not only have structures  and  programmes
and accede to charters and conventions. We must see change  in  the  quality
of life of our people. We are  therefore  committed  to  ensuring  that  the
targets we set as Government are actually reached and the whole basis of  an
integrated presidency, which I  have  already  described,  is  available  to
ensure that those previously excluded are mainstreamed  into  the  life  and
business of the nation.

Cabinet clusters, also described in the  report-back  to  the  nation,  give
momentum to the implementation and monitoring of cross-cutting  policies  to
ensure this mainstreaming. The three programmes in the Presidency,  as  well
as the National Youth Commission, a statutory body, are working  in  a  more
integrated and co-ordinated manner, not only in relation to  departments  of
state and civil society, but also in terms of the  areas  of  responsibility
of each.

A key challenge in this regard is how to  devolve  this  co-ordination,  and
focus on the disabled, women, young people and children, to  the  provincial
governments and, most importantly, to our  newly  elected  local  government
authorities. For most people, the reality of change will be there only  when
these structures play their full part.

Since vast numbers of our historically neglected people live  in  the  rural
areas,  the  dumping  grounds  of  apartheid,  the  Government's  Integrated
Sustainable Rural  Development  Strategy  provides  a  structured  basis  to
spread the benefits of our activities over the widest  possible  front.  The
thrust of the mainstreaming programme is  to  devote  energy  to  identified
national priorities and not to create  new  programmes  or  priorities.  For
this reason, the primary interest of the Office on the Status of Women,  the
Office on the Status of the Disabled and the Office on  the  Rights  of  the
Child, with regard to mainstreaming these crucial transformation  issues  in
this financial year, will be to focus on programmes such as  the  Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Strategy.

Careful monitoring must take place at the identified nodal points, so as  to
ensure that the concerns and challenges represented by these programmes  are
phased in and action  taken.  We  will  also  create  standards  and  ensure
training for all those who  work  at  this  level.  The  objective  is  that
elected representatives and  officials  with  the  ability  and  sensitivity
deliver in a way that  incorporates  the  issues  and  concerns  of  gender,
disability and young people.

The Urban Renewal Strategy provides a similar window of opportunity  in  the
sprawling and neglected concentrations of  poor  people  who  are  scattered
around the islands of opulence left by the South  African  history.  But  we
should not see urban and rural as distinct and separate. They  are  part  of
the South African whole.

The importance of transformation in these areas is not only relevant  inside
South  Africa,  but  also  regionally,  on  the  continent  of  Africa   and
internationally. The role that we have played and continue to play in  these
theatres indicate  that  our  leadership,  particularly,  of  the  President
himself, is widely respected and appreciated.

In the coming year, we shall build  on  the  adoption  of  the  SA  National
Gender Policy Framework that  we  adopted  in  December  last  year  through
popularising this policy framework. An  easy-to-follow  version,  translated
into four of our national  languages  with  concurrent  workshops,  and  the
implications of these policy positions in all nine  provinces  are  planned.
Similarly, a national gender summit  to  look  at  the  challenges  for  the
gender machinery  in  south  Africa  is  planned  in  conjunction  with  the
Commission on Gender Equality for later this year.

 The ongoing training and building of capacity in provincial Offices on  the
Status of Women and national departmental gender focal  points  are  reaping
fruit. These initiatives will be further strengthened in collaboration  with
the UN Development Programme, UNDP, during the  coming  year.  We  are  busy
with the process of putting in place the  draft  2nd  Cedaw  country  Report
which is due in February 2002. This  process  will  further  strengthen  the
close co-operation between the Office on the Status of Women  Commission  on
Gender Equality, Parliament, Government and civil society.

The Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and  Status
of Women has grown in stature and is a strong voice not only in  Parliament,
but also in other spheres of our society. The good work must continue.

Over the past few years we have taken big  strides  in  the  empowerment  of
women. The representation of women in Parliament, the Cabinet and as  Deputy
Ministers is but an indication of that. Of 14  Deputy  Ministers  seven  are
women,  and,  of  27  Ministers,  nine  are  women,  not  to  mention  their
responsibility for strategic areas of governance.

In Parliament, the  Speaker  and  Deputy  Speaker  of  this  House  and  the
Chairperson of the NCOP are women. In the Presidency,  three  out  of  three
serving Deputy Directors-General are women and,  similarly,  the  occupation
of senior and top management positions by women in the Public Service is  no
longer the exception. All this is a huge stride from what  we  inherited  in
1994.

But we are not satisfied with the situation, and we are determined to  bring
in more women, both in elected and employed positions  in  order  to  ensure
true equity, particularly in rural areas where women  suffer  such  enormous
burdens and such extreme poverty.

The targets and challenges, in terms of advancing the status and  rights  of
people with disabilities that we set for ourselves  through  the  Integrated
National Disability Strategy, are there for all to see. The extent to  which
we have advanced is evident in this House  today.  Few  parliaments  in  the
world, if any, equal the number of members with disabilities  that  we  have
in our Parliament.

The  crucial  role  of  this  House's  newly  established  Joint  Monitoring
Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and Status  of  Children,  Youth
and  Disabled  Persons,  should  be  commended.  Their  work  must  grow  in
importance and stature.

While mindful of the role that Parliament has played  in  empowering  people
with disabilities, it is hoped that this  good  work  will  be  extended  to
ensure that there is the right physical infrastructure, ethos and  budgeting
procedure to cater for disabled persons, and an increase in the  numbers  of
members with disabilities after the 2004 elections. In saying this, I  thank
the Presiding Officers for major work already done.

The establishment of the representative SA  Federal  Council  on  Disability
provided the most important institutional capacity to build and support  the
disability movement in South Africa. With the  launch  of  the  Thabo  Mbeki
Development Trust for Disabled People, this institutional capacity has  been
extended also to provide sustained and  focused  funding  for  developmental
initiatives and the economic empowerment of disabled people.  I  again  want
to express our gratitude for the continued  funding  and  technical  support
from the Swedish government, through the Swedish  International  Development
Agency, in this regard.

Last year we reported on the economic empowerment initiatives  in  terms  of
the  transformation  of  sheltered  and  protected  workshops  into   viable
business units and training centres. An interdepartmental task team has  now
being established, and we will report on advances made in this regard as  we
progress.

On the continent and in  the  international  arenas  we  have  been  closely
associated with the African Decade for Disabled Persons. We are also in  the
process of engaging friendly countries on the possibility of  expanding  the
UN standard rules into a full-fledged UN Convention on the Rights of  People
with Disabilities. This is something that we believe is  intrinsically  part
of the advancement of the status and  rights  of  people  with  disabilities
internationally.

 On June 1 this year Parliament was a hub of  activities,  song,  dance  and
music, to celebrate our  continued  awareness  campaign  on  the  rights  of
children. It marked the launch of  a  status  report  on  the  situation  of
children in South Africa, as well as our submission to the UN  special  end-
of-the-decade  session  and  related  promotional   material.   The   widely
consulted children and media code continues to highlight the  challenges  we
face in terms of the relationship between children and the media. This  code
now provides a strong basis for continued  interaction  with  the  media  in
ensuring the rights of children.

This coming year we will also see a broadening of the national programme  of
action for children's activities to  local  government  level.  A  range  of
workshops  and  interactions  with  these  authorities,  specifically  those
identified as nodal points for the Rural Development Strategy, are  planned,
and should lead to these authorities  adopting  local  plans  of  action  to
build  and  enhance  the  rights  of  children  and  reverse  the   specific
challenges we face.

The National Youth Commission, the statutory body  charged  with  monitoring
and advancing youth development, played a leading role in arranging for  the
highly  successful  celebration  of  the  25th  anniversary  of  the  Soweto
Uprising this past week. The work of the NYC and  all  who  work  with  them
should  be  commended.  The  celebrations  affirmed  our  and  the   youth's
commitment to the ideals of a nonracial, nonsexist, democratic society.
The recent launch of a national youth employment clearing house by the  NYC,
and the successful youth service pilot project, in conjunction  with  public
works and the Office on the Status of Disabled  People  in  the  Presidency,
are but examples of the initiatives to advance  viable  programmes  for  the
economic empowerment of young people. Consultations between the NYC and  the
Departments of Labour, Education and Trade and  Industry  are  on  going  to
find ways of incorporating young people in the  human  resource  development
strategy of the Government. [Interjections.] Yes, my time is up, but  may  I
take the opportunity to express my deepest thanks and  appreciation  to  the
Joint Monitoring Committee on the Status and Quality of Life of  Women,  the
JMC on the Status and Quality  of  Life  of  Children,  the  Youth  and  the
disabled.  It has been a pleasure working with these  committees  and  their
chairperson ...

Mr K M ANDREW: Mr Chairperson, is  there  one  rule  for  some  members  and
another for others? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, you are aware  that
a Presiding Officer has a certain discretion,  and  when  it  comes  to  the
question of greetings, if one, no matter who it is, makes  such  a  greeting
or passing thanks to someone, that is allowed. The Speaker  has  allowed  it
in the past and it is a  tradition  of  this  House.  Hon  Minister,  please
continue and finish that.

The MINISTER: Chairperson, thank you very much.  Similarly  it  has  been  a
pleasure to work with the Chairperson, commissioners, the CEO and  staff  of
the National Youth Commission during the past year.

I also express my appreciation for the work and commitment of the heads  and
staff of the Office on the Status of Women, the  Office  on  the  Status  of
Disabled People and the Office on the Rights of  the  Child,  in  particular
the Director-General, and staff of the Presidency  in  general.  Thank  you,
Chairperson, for giving me this opportunity.
[Applause.]

Ms E  GANDHI:  Mr  Chairperson,  hon  President,  comrades  and  colleagues.
Parliament has recently received three reports  on  the  elderly,  on  human
rights, abuse of children in school and on drug abuse.  They  reveal  a  sad
story of abuse of helpless people - the  elderly,  the  children  and  those
addicted to drugs. Reading these reports makes one wonder about the kind  of
society in which we are living. But we daily encounter people who  walk  the
extra mile to help others. Thousands of volunteers working in all  walks  of
life selflessly give up their time, but their stories are seldom heard.

Apartheid was an evil that was characterised, among  a  host  of  repressive
laws, by a brutal migratory labour  system,  forced  removals  of  families,
repression and separate development, resulting in  the  break-up  of  family
life and separation of the races.

Apartheid education was designed to subjugate the  majority  of  the  people
while a small minority received education and, in the words of Chief  Albert
Luthuli:
  The majority of the whites have gone far along the road to the worship of
  material prosperity, they cling to  it  with  religious  fervour,  and  I
  sometimes suspect that this is because they have no  living  alternative.
  The mysterious, the profound and the supernatural are elbowed  aside  and
  contempt for true religion is taken a stage further.

A  result  of  this  heritage  is  the  present-day  self-centred,  uncaring
attitude that we see. Our own traditional  values  of  ubuntu  are  also  at
great risk at this time in our history.

Yet alongside apartheid grew the freedom struggle. We learned to  share.  We
learned to suffer. We learned to care for each other and we gave up  all  we
had without thinking of tomorrow. Ubuntu was alive and well.  This  was  the
tradition of the selfless spirit that we inherited in the freedom  struggle.
Today, if we want to fight crime and abuse of  the  vulnerable  we  need  to
nurture this inheritance and discard  the  selfish,  materialistic  tendency
that plagues our new-born democracy. No number of laws,  policies,  prisons,
institutions and police will be able to deal with the problems plaguing  us.


May I remind members of the resolution we passed at the Mafikeng  conference
of the ANC on the elderly, noting that there  is  a  growing  population  of
elderly  people  in  South  African  society.  Grants  for  elderly   people
constitute about 80% of all grants  issued  to  beneficiaries.  We  resolved
that society must affirm aging as an integral part of  the  life  cycle.  We
must reflect, once again, on the practice of ubuntu by  affirming  the  role
of elderly people in society. We must prevent the abuse  of  elderly  people
by families and communities.

We need nurses, doctors, social workers and  teachers  who  are  caring  and
have a sense of service. Love and caring cannot be bought,  nor  can  it  be
imposed. It can only come from within, and here I wish  to  acknowledge  the
work the President is doing together  with  religious  leaders  towards  the
moral regeneration of our society.

Just as the President and the Deputy President are  bringing  the  different
religions together in this work, we too, in our communities, are helping  to
work towards building families, family  values  and  nationhood.  There  are
numerous projects all over the country. Some are led by  the  Department  of
Social  Development  and  others  by  volunteers,  working  towards   family
preservation.

Diakonia Council  of  Churches  is  doing  tremendous  work  in  Durban  and
surrounding areas. I have seen the work done in Phoenix and Inanda,  started
by young volunteers and social workers. Ms Gugu Mthembu started  the  family
preservation programme in Inanda. Sinla Moonsamy and  Stanley  Moonsamy  are
co-ordinating the domestic violence  helpline  and  self-help  and  training
projects in Phoenix. Pat Horne has brought together self-employed women  and
street vendors. There are thousands of other dedicated workers all over  the
country, to whom we say that we appreciate  their  dedication  and  service.
Let us replicate these examples.

In supporting this Vote, I want to stress to Comrade President that  instead
of singing the song of doom and gloom, it is time that  we  patriotic  South
Africans began to celebrate some of  the  innovative,  good,  indeed,  world
class work that is being done quietly by our people on the ground.

The burden  of  these  most  disadvantaged  cannot  be  eased  by  piecemeal
efforts. Only through fighting  poverty,  underdevelopment,  illiteracy  and
disease in an integrated way and only by our society grasping the  challenge
of transformation, as one, will we make progress.

Our history and condition requires our Presidency to  lead  the  process  of
delivery and transformation, to integrate and co-ordinate the programmes  of
the  Government,  and  to  strengthen  the  interface  between  spheres   of
Government and civil society. All members of  this  House  should  unite  to
support and strengthen this Presidency in its task  of  leading  our  nation
into a prosperous, proud and peaceful future. [Applause.]

 Dr P W A MULDER: Chairperson, Deputy President, last week  marked  the  end
of the first two years of the term of President Mbeki as President of  South
Africa. Of course, he wants to make a success of his Presidency. I  am  also
a newly elected leader of my party.  Of  course,  I  also  want  to  make  a
success of my leadership. The question is: Is it possible for both of us  to
achieve political  success  and  both  be  winners?  Is  outmanoeuvring  one
another the only way that political leaders  can  succeed?  Is  his  victory
always our defeat, or the other way round?

In 1910, according to history, the Union of South Africa  was  formed.  Many
whites saw it as a victory. For different reasons,  black  people  and  some
Afrikaners saw it as a defeat. Nine years later, each of these  groups  sent
their own delegation to the peace talks at  Versailles.  The  Afrikaner-Boer
delegation  asked  for  their  freedom  and  that  the  boer  republics   be
reinstated. The ANC delegation asked for political  rights.  In  1910  there
were political winners and losers.

In 1961 Afrikaners won a referendum and created a republic,  avenging  their
defeat at the hands of the British in  1902.  Blacks,  and  a  young  Nelson
Mandela reacted with armed resistance. In 1961 there were political  winners
and losers.

And in 1994? Were there only winners?  Any  opinion  poll  among  Afrikaners
today will tell one that the majority of Afrikaners  believe  that  the  ANC
was the winner, and Afrikaners the losers. No amount of  propaganda  on  the
South African miracle or hindsight truths will change that.

When I was elected leader of the FF in March, I committed myself  to  trying
to get win-win solutions for South Africa's problems. I really believe  that
it can be done. A prominent Afrikaner academic recently wrote that there  is
a growing estrangement between the ANC Government and Afrikaners. I have  an
article here written by another Afrikaner academic. The  heading  is:  ``The
ANC's 10-year plan to get rid of Afrikaans.'' One can read  the  letters  to
the editor in any Afrikaans newspaper to understand the mood and the  debate
in Afrikaner circles.

Must I tell the President this? Yes, surely that is  my  job.   There  is  a
saying in Xhosa that a baby that does not cry dies whilst  strapped  to  the
back  of   its   mother.   ``Usana   olungakhaliyo   lufela   embelekweni.''
[Interjections.]

What do Afrikaners talk about while standing  around  the  braai-fire,  when
they are alone and need not be politically correct? They speak of crime  and
the cruelty of the latest farm murder. They speak of feeling like  strangers
in South Africa, being powerless with no future.  Each  one  tells  his  own
story of injustice and unfairness within the workplace, how  Afrikaners  are
unfairly blamed for everything that goes wrong.

What do black people talk about when they  are  on  their  own?  Many  black
people  seem  to  have  forgotten  that  many  Afrikaners  both  speak   and
understand their languages. They say  that  whites  are  ungrateful,  whites
should have had a Nuremberg trial and that President Mbeki is far  too  soft
with these exploiters. They use selective findings of the  Truth  Commission
to support their points of view.

It is interesting to note that black criticism  is  just  as  sharp  towards
coloured and Asian people from my  experience.  These  views  are  hardly  a
recipe for a win-win  solution.  What  is  happening  between  us  in  South
Africa. Are we slowly moving apart? Can we learn  from  our  neighbours  and
avoid the same mistakes? Zimbabwe had all  the  opportunities  for  success,
mineral wealth, a prosperous agricultural sector, a good  infrastructure,  a
core of skills, a small but diversified industry and  great  natural  beauty
for tourism.

With the political settlement in 1980, it seemed  inevitable  that  Zimbabwe
would flourish with rising living standards for all. What is  the  situation
today? Let us forget about the whites. Black  Zimbabweans  now  have  higher
unemployment and lower living standards than they did 10 ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, are you  rising  on
a point of order?

Mr M M CHIKANE: Yes, Chairperson. I want to ask the hon member  a  question,
if he would take it.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, will you take a question?

Dr P W A MULDER: Chairperson, I would really like to take a question, but  I
have got limited time. If there is time left,  I  will  certainly  answer  a
question. I like debate.

The reasons are clear: state control - I am talking about Zimbabwe  and  the
interference in the economy - overtaxation, corruption and, above  all,  the
way President Mugabe crushed all opposition and silenced  all  critics.  Any
white person who dared to criticise him was instantly called  a  racist  and
any black person who criticised him, a  tool  and  a  puppet  of  the  white
racists.

And in South Africa? Calls for reconciliation that were  made  in  the  past
are now replaced with  debates  on  racism.  Cabinet  Ministers  answer  all
criticism by blaming old racism. During the past year we had  three  special
parliamentary debates on racism. Debates on racism may  help  to  unite  the
ANC by recalling the good old struggle feelings, but that struggle  is  gone
forever. The ANC is now the system. The  ANC  is  now  the  system  and  the
President must make his peace with that.

These debates in no way contribute to better  relations  between  black  and
white.  On  the  contrary,  racism  debates  invariably   lead   to   mutual
accusations  and  stereotyping,  to   ``them-and-us''   arguments.   In   my
experience, racism debates lead to more racism and play into  the  hands  of
extremists. I can quote to the House some extremist speeches in this  House,
or speeches made outside  South  African  court  buildings,  mobilising  and
polarising people.

Those are the easiest speeches to make. One does not need a mind  for  them,
only emotions. What is objectionable, what is  dangerous  about  extremists,
is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant. The evil is  not
in what  they  say  about  their  cause,  but  what  they  say  about  their
opponents.

The racism debate will, in time, penetrate through the  rank  and  file  and
this will mean that the levels of tension and mistrust will rise. Of  course
the FF can also play that game. It is even easier for  us,  because  in  our
position, we do not carry the responsibility of Government.

For the first time we see big marches  to  court  buildings  by  whites  and
their farmworkers, as happened yesterday in Ceres and the previous  week  in
the Free State. Is this the recipe for a win-win solution to South  Africa's
problems? Why do we not  formulate  a  precise  definition  of  racism  that
everybody will understand? Once having isolated the  real  racists  on  both
sides, stop bullying the rest with accusations of racism.

Seven thousand people applied for  amnesty,  more  than  5 000  were  denied
amnesty. The reason in most cases was that they allegedly  did  not  make  a
full disclosure. What an unconvincing reason! How can the amnesty  committee
determine whether one has told the whole truth, without  knowing  the  whole
truth themselves? Does the hon the President really believe anyone will  not
make a full disclosure knowing that the alternative is staying in  jail  for
the rest of his or her life?

Therefore, for the next 10 years in South Africa, we will have  court  cases
to prosecute these 5 000 people. Hardly a win-win  atmosphere!  All  racists
in South Africa are yearning for peace and harmony.  To  achieve  this  goal
requires a solution between the Afrikaners  of  South  Africa  and,  on  the
other side, the Africans of Africa. Such a solution must  create  a  win-win
situation for all. Please do not give us the old answer that the  Government
knows what is best for everyone.

The ANC must make its choices. Is the Afrikaner part of the problem or  part
of the solution? One cannot wish the Afrikaner away. Self-determination  and
minority rights for those who want it, and as successfully applied  in  many
other countries around the world, must become  part  of  the  South  African
political  solution.  It  must  include  cultural  and   territorial   self-
determination. In spite  of  the  fact  that  it  will  lead  to  a  win-win
situation, it is also a  modern  and  well  developed  option.  Let  us  not
redesign the wheel.

This option allows for  a  win-win  situation  for  the  ANC  to  transform,
redistribute and to affirm. But, it also offers Afrikaners enough  hope  and
scope to be an Afrikaner in Africa, and to exercise their culture  and  feel
comfortable and not disempowered.

 On 23  April  1994,  the  FF  signed  an  accord  with  the  ANC  on  self-
determination. The accord was signed by President Mbeki on the one side  and
General Viljoen on the other. For the benefit of the new members, I want  to
read from that accord.

Section 1 goes: ``the  parties  agree  to  address,  through  a  process  of
negotiations,    the    idea    of     Afrikaner's     self-determination''.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Dr P W A MULDER: Section 2 provides that the parties  ``further  agree  that
in  the  consideration  of  these  matters,  they  shall  not  exclude   the
possibility of local, original and other forms of expression of  such  self-
determination''. In  the  latest  ANC  letter  from  the  President  on  the
Internet, President Mbeki writes about the people of the United Kingdom  and
he says: ``They said that they believe us because they know that we keep  to
our commitments and  do  not  tell  lies.''  This  year,  the  ANC  and  the
Afrikaner commitments will be tested.

When the ANC Government addresses the problems of  the  Afrikaans  language,
Afrikaans  schools  and  universities   as   well   as   territorial   self-
determination, the ANC will be surprised to see how much positive  Afrikaner
energy will emerge to support and help resolve the country's problems.

But, the President should not confuse Afrikaner  friendship  with  weakness.
He should not see the willingness to co-operate as submission to  relinquish
ideals. I represent the people who have voted for  me,  that  is  why  I  am
here, and I will come back  in  2004  with  more  votes  and  I  will  still
represent them. [Interjections.] History has  proven  the  strength  of  the
Afrikaner to persevere in their beliefs for their ideals.

I know President Mbeki wants to make a success of his  Presidency.  But,  so
do I. With extremism  and  polarisation  we  will  repeat  the  mistakes  of
Zimbabwe, and we will be fighting each other for the next 20  years  in  win
or lose political battles. With wisdom, win-win solutions  in  South  Africa
are still possible.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson,  I  listened  with  interest  to  Dr  Mulder's
speech. He must be careful about  pretending  to  speak  on  behalf  of  the
Afrikaners. He represents an infinitesimal number. [Laughter.] The  hon  the
President sitting here represents more Afrikaners than he does, and we  said
we speak for far more Afrikaners than he does. [Laughter.]
Parliament belongs not to  the  MPs  or  the  President.  We  are  only  the
custodians sent here for a time by the people. If we allow Parliament to  be
diminished or sidelined, it  is  the  people  who  are  being  treated  with
contempt.

When Ministers take power over the  provinces,  and  when  mayors  and  city
managers are not appointed without the  approval  of  the  ANC's  deployment
committee, then the interests of the  ANC  are  placed  well  ahead  of  the
interests of the voter, ratepayer and the provisions of our Constitution.

This is what is happening during the President's watch. I would like to  ask
whether it is happening with  his  approval,  or  even  worse,  without  his
knowledge? The buck stops with him. My hon leader today urged the  President
to take responsibility for what is happening. The President correctly  takes
the credit for the good and the successes.  He  also  needs  to  accept  the
blame for what is wrong.

The President presides over the party which is close to subverting the  code
of ethics, of which we were so proud a few years ago. He  stated  incredibly
that he has not even spoken to his Chief Whip about the allegations  against
him. Why not, Sir? Was he not concerned? Perhaps  that  is  why  the  Ethics
Committee was able to drag its feet for weeks and months. That is why  their
report was only tabled two days ago under pressure from the opposition,  and
it is not going to be debated in this House until some  time  in  September.
There is one rule for ordinary people and quite another  rule  for  the  ANC
elite. Anything which embarrasses his side is held over or is  simply  swept
aside.

He has been advised to go out and meet the people. I want  to  suggest  that
he goes to some of the towns and cities around the country where ANC  mayors
are becoming known for their desire to live like princes and  potentates  in
multimillion rands mansions bought for them by the  ratepayers.  Luxury  for
the elite and very little for the poor is the message  which  is  going  out
from his party. This is becoming a hallmark of his Government.

The Minister of Safety and Security runs around the country  blustering  and
promising, but delivers nothing. People have lost confidence in his  ability
to solve crime.

Their Minister of Education,  who  is  absent,  is  grabbing  power.  He  is
required  to  establish  policy  guidelines,  but   he   continues   issuing
instructions and ignoring MECs and treating them as the administrative  arms
of the central Government. He  does  nothing  in  Gauteng,  where  he  could
perhaps do something. There one  has  an  incompetent  MEC  in  Mr  Ignatius
Jacobs. The state of education in that province is abysmal and the  standard
is deteriorating in those schools. The parents in that province - at  least,
the one I know the best - are being sold short, and  these  are  mainly  the
poor parents, because their children are not being given  the  opportunities
that we have promised them. We want the President to know about this and  to
act now.

The President seems to limp from crisis to crisis. The good  publicity  from
his visit to the UK was overshadowed by the  ghastly  publicity  surrounding
the Winnie Mandela incident. People might expect us to keep quiet about  it,
but we cannot do that. People want to be proud of him, they want to look  up
to him as the father of our nation. But  millions  of  South  Africans,  and
especially women, were horrified at the spectacle. [Interjections.]

We, in the DP, have never seen eye to  eye  with  the  hon  Winnie  Mandela.
[Interjections.] We have suggested that it is  disgraceful  that  his  party
has failed to call her to  account  in  the  streets  of  South  Africa  or,
indeed, in Parliament. She is a law unto herself, but - I would like to  say
to the hon the President - that does not justify treating her like  a  piece
of rubbish in front of millions of voters.

I  want  the  President  to  apologise  to  her   and   to   South   Africa.
[Interjections.] I appeal to him to do so in his  response  tomorrow.  There
is nothing wrong with saying I am sorry. Bigger people than me are  prepared
to do that, and the President is much bigger than me.  I  want  to  see  him
say: ``I am sorry, I will not do that again.'' [Interjections.]

The Vote which we are being asked to consider  today  is  a  very  important
Vote, because we have been asked: ``Should we vote the money to enable  this
Presidency to continue?'' I want to say that we  are  terribly  disappointed
with this Presidency. It started with so much  promise,  and  two  years  on
those hopes have been dashed. But he still has three  years.  He  still  has
time to persuade the people of South Africa that he can  deliver,  that  the
Mbeki Presidency is not going to be the disaster that it  has  been  in  the
last two years.

I appeal to him to pull this Government up by its bootstraps,  and  to  come
out now and do something so that the millions of South Africans who want  to
see him and his Government succeed will  not  have  their  hopes  dashed.  I
appeal to the President to do that.

We speak on behalf of the minority in this country. I  want  to  remind  him
that minorities can become majorities. [Interjections.] We will be  opposing
this Vote, and we do so in the certain knowledge that at least what  we  are
doing is underlining to the people of this country that we expect more  from
this Government, that we expect more from the President  than  he  has  been
able or willing to give  to  us  and  give  to  South  Africa  today.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  members,  there  are  too
many of you in the aisles. If you will, either take your seats or  make  for
the exit.

Mr M I MOSS: Mr Chairperson, Comrade President Thabo Mbeki,  Comrade  Deputy
President and hon members, there are some things that are best  ignored.  So
I will not lend any worth to the narrow rantings befitting the  small  minds
of those with IQs no higher than the temperature in this House.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.] The hon Douglas Gibson is one of them.

The ANC-led Government has, since 1994,  acknowledged  children,  the  youth
and disabled as amongst the most  vulnerable  sectors  in  our  society.  To
address the plight of these groups, the Government accommodates them in  the
Office of the Presidency.

The offices on the status of the disabled, children and the youth have  been
headed by the Minister in the President's  Office  since  June  1999.  These
offices aim to improve the status  and  life  of  these  sectors.  Forty-six
years ago the ANC adopted a  document  called  the  Freedom  Charter,  which
paved the way for freedom and liberation. The Freedom Charter  goes,  and  I
quote:


  The law shall guarantee to all the right to speak, to organise,  to  meet
  together, to  publish,  to  preach,  to  worship  and  to  educate  their
  children.

Under the National Party government, these rights were denied to the  people
of South Africa. In the past, years honouring  the  disabled  children,  and
the elderly were declared by the National Party regime.  Nothing  was  done.
Instead, children and disabled  people  got  burnt  and  were  neglected  in
government institutions. The Freedom Charter also states that  child  labour
shall be abolished. It also states that the aged and the disabled  shall  be
cared for by the state, and free medical care and hospitalisation  shall  be
provided for all, with special care for mothers and young children.

In September 1987, many organisations and activists  went  to  Zimbabwe  for
the Harare Children's Conference. Half of the national  executive  committee
of the ANC, including its past President,  Oliver  Tambo,  listened  to  the
grim stories of the apartheid regime under which young  black  children  had
survived and resisted the brutality  of  the  apartheid  oppression  of  the
security forces.

During the 1994 elections, the ANC campaigned and promised to implement  the
above-mentioned policies. The ANC can hold its head high and  be  proud,  as
it has already implemented these policies. [Applause.]

Today, education is free and compulsory for up to 10 years. Feeding  schemes
in  schools  and  financial  schemes  for  tertiary   students   have   been
implemented. To mention a few more,  child  grants  have  been  extended  to
millions of children and all races are enjoying this. The UN  Convention  on
the Rights of the Child  has  been  signed  by  our  Government.  The  OAU's
Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the African Child was ratified  by  our
Government in 1999.

Children are given equal opportunities and their  voices  are  indeed  being
heard. On Children's Day, Members of  Parliament  signed  the  media  ethics
code for children.  The  national  plan  of  action  for  children  plays  a
monitoring role  in  ensuring  that  legislation  and  programmes  affecting
children are being implemented. The provincial  plan  of  action  plays  the
same role in the provinces.

Die jeug het veral sedert  1976  'n  baie  belangrike  rol  gespeel  in  ons
bevrydingstryd. Die veldtog om ons jongmense op te voed omtrent MIV/Vigs  is
een van die belangrikste en suksesvolste veldtogte wat die ANC Jeugliga  van
stapel laat loop het.

Almal ken vandag die ABC-slagspreuk: ``A for abstain, B for be faithful  and
C  for  condomise'',  wat  beteken   ``bly   weg'',   ``wees   getrou''   en
``kondomiseer''.

Die president van die ANC se Jeugliga, Malusi Gigaba, en ander sprekers  het
op 16 Junie weer eens 'n baie sterk beroep gedoen  op  die  jeug  van  Suid-
Afrika om saam te werk om 'n nie-rassige Suid-Afrika te bou.  Die  President
het vroeër, minder as vier uur gelede, ook dié sterk  beroep  van  dieselfde
podium af gedoen.

Die Nasionale Jeugkommissie is in 1997 in die lewe geroep  om  programme  en
beleid vir die jeug  te  monitor.  Die  kommissie  se  rol  behels  ook  die
monitering van regeringsdepartemente om toe te sien  dat  hulle  die  beleid
uitvoer en die dienste lewer.

Die Umsobomvufonds is gestig vir die ontwikkeling van  die  vaardighede  van
jongmense sowel as om toe te sien dat  kleinsakeondernemings  vir  die  jeug
gestig word. Na maande van beplanning word die fonds nou in  werking  gestel
om onderhoubare ontwikkeling te bewerkstellig en nie  om  liefdadigheid  uit
te deel nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The youth, especially since 1976, have played  an  important  role  in  our
liberation struggle. The  campaign  to  educate  our  youth  in  respect  of
HIV/Aids is one of the most important and successful campaigns that the  ANC
Youth League has ever launched.

Today everyone knows the ANC slogan: ``A for abstain, B for be faithful  and
C for  condomise  ''  which  means  ``stay  away'',  ``stay  faithful''  and
``condomise''.

The president of the ANC Youth League, Malusi  Gigaba,  and  other  speakers
once again on 16 June made strong appeals to the youth of  South  Africa  to
co-operate in building a nonracial  South  Africa.  The  President  earlier,
less than four hours prior to that, also made this strong  appeal  from  the
very same podium.

The National Youth Commission was established in 1997 to monitor  programmes
and policies for the youth. The commission's role  also  entails  monitoring
Government departments to  ensure  that  they  apply  policies  and  deliver
services.

The Umsobomvu Fund was introduced to develop the  skills  of  the  youth  as
well as to  ensure  that  small  business  enterprises  for  the  youth  are
established. After years  of  planning  the  fund  is  now  being  put  into
operation to bring  about  sustainable  development  and  not  to  hand  out
charity.]

With the White Paper on an integrated national disability strategy, the  ANC
Government has adopted the disability rights  position  of  integration  and
equality. The Government policy on disability has  changed  from  a  medical
one to a social one.

Disabled people are no longer viewed as sick, people  to  be  isolated  from
society, but recognised as playing a rightful role in society.  Many  pieces
of legislation, with specific reference to the Employment  Equity  Act,  and
the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act,  were
passed to ensure this equity for disabled people.

The Department of Public  Works  is  working  closely  with  the  disability
sector in converting old public buildings to make them accessible to  people
with disabilities. Through this, jobs  are  being  created  and  skills  are
gained, especially for the youth ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson,  His  Excellency  the  President,  the  Deputy
President and hon members, the Vote of the Presidency  is  the  last  to  be
considered this year, and  appropriately  so  as  it  will  dispel  whatever
doubts there were, while, on the other hand, it is hoped that it  will  give
assurance that all is well in Government and in the country.

The Presidency is the very  focus  of  national  life.  The  output  of  the
institutions of political power in any country ends up  in  the  Presidency.
After all, that is where the buck stops. It is  therefore  not  unreasonable
to ask the President to furnish answers to issues such  as  the  SAA/Coleman
saga. But, to this end, we are grateful that the President  has  stated  the
position of Government. We shall wait until Saturday.  Magistrates,  on  the
other hand, are reported as having found no joy in directing their  problems
and pleas to the relevant Minister, and all eyes look up to  the  father  of
the nation for redress.

Hon Minister Buthelezi mentioned earlier a whole catalogue  of  issues  that
need the attention of the President. But, the one that  is  very  urgent  is
the matter between the former members of the SA National Defence  Force  and
the department. These soldiers, 450 in number, have engaged  the  department
since 1998, and their last meeting with the department  was  on  2  November
2000. They were promised  that  their  plight,  which  revolves  around  the
voluntary severance packages, would be attended to, but nothing has come  of
that.

I would like to tell the hon the President that it is in  times  like  these
when law-abiding citizens who are suffering look towards the father to  come
to their rescue. There is no doubt that the decision  by  the  President  to
appoint directors-general to the departments in consultation with  Ministers
has proved to be the best way out  because,  up  to  this  far,  no  tension
between Ministers and directors-general has been reported. It is  such  good
working relations that make  governance  a  pleasure  which  gives  rise  to
success.

We note  with  appreciation  that,  as  stated  in  the  state-of-the-nation
address earlier this year, and  even  this  afternoon,  legislation  on  the
Commission for the Promotion and  Protection  of  the  Rights  of  Cultural,
Religious and Linguistic Communities will be passed before the  end  of  the
year. We are aware that the portfolio committee responsible  for  that  will
consider the Bill in the next term. We also look forward to  the  Bill  that
deals with the powers and functions of traditional leaders,  which  is  also
set for tabling next term. These two Bills and others will  help  strengthen
the Constitution and help resolve the uncertainties in  the  ranks  of  some
sections of the population. I would like to tell the hon the President  that
what all South Africans need is the reassurance that they  matter  and  that
they have something to present to this country.

 The amended Act of the National Youth Council gave rise  to  a  council  of
five. It made it leaner and we hope that it will function more  efficiently.
The commission still has to be visible, though, particularly  to  the  youth
in the rural parts of the country as provincial youth councils,  where  they
do exist, are mostly office-bound. The council has to work on its  corporate
image so that it would not be mistaken for an extension  of  the  ANC  Youth
League.  It  has  to  work  hard  to  reach  out  to  nongovernmental  youth
formations. There are youth groups in churches that the commission can  work
with.

We appreciate the young prisoners' programme which is the brainchild of  the
National  Youth  Commission.  We  laud  the  altruistic  approach  that  the
commission has followed in that they have spared  a  thought  for  those  of
their brothers and sisters who are in conflict with  the  law  by  arranging
programmes for their rehabilitation and skills  development  in  conjunction
with the Department of Correctional Services.

The effort of the National Youth  Commission  to  reach  out  to  the  other
youth, to make them aware and  call  on  them  to  participate  in  fighting
against HIV/Aids are praiseworthy. These great efforts  of  theirs  make  us
believe, as a nation, that in them we have trustees of posterity.

We call on the people in this country  to  lend  a  hand  in  improving  the
quality of life of the people in the rural areas. These places  continue  to
remain centres of abject poverty, women and children continue to be  abused,
unemployment  levels  continue  to  rise  and   instances   of   depression,
alcoholism and in some cases even suicide result because of want.

We  appeal  to  the  structures  that  deal  with  children,   people   with
disabilities and women in the Presidency to reach out to  these  people  who
live far from the madding crowds with their  ignoble  strives  and  reassure
them that  in  destitution,  hunger  and  sickness  they  are  worthy  South
Africans.
Mr V G SMITH: Chairperson, hon President and members, in the early  fifties,
when the struggle for freedom was reaching new intensity,  the  need  for  a
clear statement on what the character of a future  South  Africa  should  be
was crafted and adopted in Kliptown by the people of this country.

This characterisation was  captured  in  the  first  lines  of  the  Freedom
Charter that declared that:


  ... South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that
  no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on  the  will
  of all the people ...

This country has come a long way since the dark days of the  repressive  and
unjust practices of governing by denying ordinary South Africans  the  right
to know and participate. Lack of  transparency  and  an  autocratic  way  of
governing was the order of the day under the  NP  government,  and  some  of
those practitioners and proponents of that unjust system are still  in  this
Parliament even to this day. Many commissions of  inquiry  were  set  up  to
investigate a variety of issues, ranging from air disasters  to  hit  squads
and so on. The people of this c ountry were denied the right  of  access  to
information emanating from these inquiries, thereby remaining  oblivious  of
the government-sponsored cover-up proceedings and initiatives. This was,  of
course, consistent with the values  of  the  apartheid  government  and  its
allies.

Today, South Africans take it as a given that transparency by Government  is
part of their rights. Experts on matters  of  oversight  go  as  far  as  to
suggest that Government's performance should and will be the  right  of  all
citizens. Members of the ANC, which constitutes the majority in  Government,
identified this as far back as 1955, thus our understanding and adoption  of
the Freedom Charter that emphasises that ``no government  can  justly  claim
authority unless it is based on the will of  the  people''  and  that  ``the
people shall govern''. These  are  the  ideals  for  which  our  leaders  of
yesteryear fought and for which they were prepared to  die.  The  ANC  today
continues to identify with these ideals.
It is  this  commitment  that  we  attempt  to  operationalise  through  the
Constitution of this country by, amongst other things,  locating  the  power
to ensure that all executive organs of  state  in  the  national  sphere  of
government are accountable to the National Assembly. Sections 56 and  59  of
the Constitution empower the National Assembly to facilitate the culture  of
transparency within Government  operations,  as  well  as  accessibility  of
information to the public at large. Prior  to  1994,  until  the  advent  of
democracy in this country, no such culture existed.

 In addition to the above,  the  Constitution  adopted  by  this  Parliament
makes provision  for  the  establishment  of  state  institutions  aimed  at
strengthening an defending this  democracy,  institutions  which  are  truly
independent and subject only to the Constitution. These are all  initiatives
and attempts to ensure that the  fight  against  corruption  is  intensified
through the oversight role of Parliament, the  Chapter  9  institutions  and
the people as a whole.

The  shallow  and  misguided  crusade  by  opposition  parties  to   portray
themselves as the only custodians of moral values must be rejected when  one
examines  their  track  record  of   apartheid   practices   and   Bantustan
dictatorships. Their insistence that because the ANC is the  majority  party
in Parliament as well as in the executive, and that we therefore merely  use
our strength in numbers to bulldoze our way, and that  this  is  reason  for
concern as far as ensuring clean and transparent  government  is  concerned,
is without basis.

Furthermore, as a young democracy, the relationship  between  the  executive
and  Parliament  is  being   developed   continuously.   Hiccups   in   this
relationship will occur from time to time. It is important to note that  all
members of the executive were party  to  negotiations  at  the  World  Trade
Centre, which led to the separation of powers between the different  spheres
of government, as reflected in  the  Constitution.  Therefore,  this  notion
that  Parliament  is  being  marginalised  by  the  executive  is  pure   DA
propaganda and cannot be taken seriously. We believe that  it  is  not  true
that one has to be neutral or apolitical to effectively  fight  the  scourge
of corruption.

The ANC is, and indeed always has  been,  at  the  forefront  of  the  fight
against corrupt practice, as can be witnessed by the resolution  adopted  at
our national general council in Port Elizabeth last year,  where  conference
resolved that:


  Legislatures  need  to  strengthen  their  oversight  and  play  a   more
  meaningful role in the monitoring of programmes  and  the  allocation  of
  resources. Furthermore, the linkage between  the  ANC  study  groups  and
  broader structures of the democratic movement should be  strengthened  at
  all levels to facilitate participation and  input  into  legislative  and
  oversight.

At the 50th national conference of the  ANC  in  Mafikeng,  we  adopted  our
strategy and tactics document, which recognised  that  in  order  to  ensure
that Government truly served the interests of  the  people,  the  ANC  would
strengthen  co-operative  governance  among  all  spheres   of   government,
national, provincial and local.

For each level to play  its  requisite  role  in  serving  the  people,  our
commitment to open and transparent government and to  ensuring  an  informed
and active citizenry is more than just high-sounding phrases. They  are  the
life-blood of democratic governance,  the  core  values  of  people-centred,
people-driven transformation. We in the  ANC  shall  therefore  continue  to
strengthen our relationship between Government and civil society,  including
nongovernmental and community-based organisations, and  promote  their  role
in the process of transformation.

Today   political   opportunists   and   the   enemies   of   transformation
mischievously define all mismanagement as corruption. All of us need  to  be
honest and acknowledge that this ANC-led Government  inherited  institutions
with an ethos of corruption and  personnel  that  were  engaged  in  corrupt
practices. All of us need to develop mechanisms  to  build  a  link  between
state intervention on corruption and  our  own  initiative  as  citizens  of
South Africa, regardless of whether we are found in the private  or  in  the
public sector.

Urgent steps need to be taken to  review  institutions  fighting  corruption
and  to  increase  their  resources  and   effectiveness   when   necessary.
Similarly, this  Presidency  has  consciously  adopted  a  strategy  of  co-
ordinating and integrating all Government  initiatives  so  that  meaningful
change in the lives of the people happens with the minimum delay.  For  this
exercise to succeed, the resources, both financial  and  otherwise,  at  the
disposal  of  the  President,  must  be  urgently  reviewed   and   adjusted
accordingly.

 We believe that we as a Government are on track in our  fight  against  all
sorts of corruption. However, we need to be realistic and recognise that  it
will take some time to  fully  implement  effective  controls  and  paradigm
shifts. More importantly, we must drive  more  vigorously  all  policies  of
fraud prevention as required  by  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act  and
similar legislation. Every  portfolio  committee  in  this  Parliament  must
become actively engaged in the monitoring of the  Act.  Initiatives  led  by
the Public Service Commission, with the involvement of  business  and  civil
society, such as the 9th International Anti-Corruption  Conference  held  in
Durban, is further visible proof  of  Government's  commitment  to  fighting
corruption wherever it exists.

Comrade Thabo Mbeki, in his closing  address  at  the  ANC's  50th  national
congress, stated that the decisions taken by the conference  meant  that  we
must transform our machinery of state as  speedily  as  possible  to  ensure
that it becomes an instrument that serves the interests of the  people.  The
President  went  further  to  state  that  our  decisions  meant  ...  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Dr M  S  MOGOBA:  Chairperson,  hon  President  and  Deputy  President,  hon
members, the recent state visit to the United Kingdom was in  many  respects
a good barometer. Our standing  in  the  world  is  still  relatively  good,
despite who we  are.  Goodwill  is,  of  course,  an  expendable  commodity,
particularly with dangers staring us in the face. We  are  standing  on  the
precipice and are balancing dangerously. Our economy  has  produced  profits
for the rich and immense poverty and joblessness for  the  poor.  Corruption
has made things worse  and  whittled  away  the  limited  resources  of  our
country.

Crime is a cancer that is eating away at the  heart  of  the  nation.  When,
three years ago, I  lost  my  patience  and  demanded  that  criminals,  who
normally do not understand the language of human rights and mistake  it  for
weakness, needed to be stopped by whatever means, I  was  scoffed  at.  Now,
the nation  is  becoming  impatient  and  the  chorus  demanding  the  death
sentence is rising to a crescendo. As  I  said  before,  I  do  not  support
capital punishment. But, what does  one  say  to  a  family  that  has  been
shattered by the painful loss of their loved ones? [Interjections.]

Aids and HIV have all the ingredients of a Greek tragedy.  When  a  calamity
like HIV/Aids hits a country and has such  a  devastating  effect  it  is  a
serious matter to indulge in equivocation and fail  to  fast-track  remedial
and emergency action intended to contain the pandemic  and  to  save  lives.
The intervention by the President and the Government  is  critical  and  our
survival as a nation depends on this intervention.

An even greater concern than the future of the nation is our vision for  the
future of our continent. On this matter, I must put on  record  the  support
of the PAC on the  issue  of  African  unity,  African  parliament,  African
defence and African economic development. These are issues that the PAC  has
advocated for more than 42 years.

When the President declared in this House: `` I am an African'',  we  wanted
to hail this, although we were also tempted to  ask:  ``Since  when?''  This
apparent cynicism on our part would have been informed by the events of  the
past 42 years, during which Pan-Africanism was roundly  condemned  and  even
declared a creation of the CIA. [Interjections.]

Apart from that many in this nation and in the continent now  want  to  know
whether, in essence, the President perceives a  difference  between  African
Renaissance and  Pan  Africanism,  and  what  the  precise  differences  and
contradictions are.

This may sound trivial but, in our view, this is the question  on  the  lips
of the nation, the continent and the world. Perhaps  we  can  be  helped  to
analyse and describe this ideological grey area. It will also help  to  give
credibility to  grand  initiatives  like  the  Millennium  African  Recovery
Programme. I believe that we need guidance here, and I think  that  this  is
very  important  for  the  realisation  of  the  President's  own  policies.
[Interjections.]

Mr E M SIGWELA: Mr Chairperson, hon  President,  Comrade  Thabo  Mbeki,  hon
Deputy  President,  Comrade  Jacob  Zuma,  comrades  and   colleagues,   our
Presidency is engaged with the gigantic task of leading our  nation  through
the most difficult stage of our national democratic revolution - a stage  in
which the  Presidency  must  rally  the  whole  nation  and  all  the  legal
instruments at its disposal for the transformation of our country  from  the
painful past of which our President,  Comrade  Thabo  Mbeki,  spoke  in  his
state-of-the-nation address on 9 February this year.

It is a past which our President described as:


  ... a past of a racially divided country, of  masters  and  servants,  of
  racially inspired conflict and mistrust. It is  a  past  of  endemic  and
  widespread poverty and gross imbalances in levels of development and  the
  distribution of wealth, income and  opportunity.  It  is  a  past  of  an
  economy that was immersed in a crisis that was destined to worsen. It  is
  a past of the denial of freedom to the majority, of  gross  violation  of
  human rights and repression, of entrenched sexism, a past of high  levels
  of crime, violence and corruption.  It  is  a  past  of  a  South  Africa
  isolated from the rest of Africa  and  the  world,  a  pariah  among  the
  nations.

This past did not  befall  our  country  and  nation  by  accident.  It  was
meticulously planned by men and women, some of whose fellow  travellers  sit
with us in this Chamber today. The result of  that  planning  was  that  our
nation and country was divided into racial  compartments.  Every  aspect  of
life, whether economical, social,  cultural,  religious  or  otherwise,  was
racially compartmentalised. This affected the spatial  development  planning
of the country in a manner that  was  detrimentally  discriminatory  to  the
black people, particularly the Africans. One could  look  at  the  resources
that were delivered to communities and one would find this to be true.

I have already said that the aforementioned was not an accident.  It  was  a
product of the warped mentality of those who  planned  and  implemented  the
system. To demonstrate this, in a reply  to  a  Minister  of  the  Christian
Reformed Church of Michigan,  USA,  in  February  1954,  Dr  D  F  Malan,  a
theologian himself, and one of the founders  of  the  apartheid  policy  and
Prime Minister of South Africa at that time, said the following:


  It must  be  appreciated  from  the  onset  that  apartheid,  separation,
  segregation  or  differentiation,  whatever  the  name   given   to   the
  traditional racial policy of South Africa, is  part  and  parcel  of  the
  South African tradition as practised since the first Dutch settlement  at
  the Cape in 1652.

Dr D F Malan went on to say:


  The deep-rooted colour consciousness  of  the  white  South  Africans,  a
  phenomenon quite beyond the comprehension of the misinformed, arises from
  the fundamental difference between the two groups, white and  black.  The
  difference in colour is merely the physical manifestation of the contrast
  between  two  irreconcilable  ways  of  life;   between   barbarism   and
  civilisation; between heathenism and Christianity, and  finally,  between
  overwhelming numerical odds on the one hand and insignificant numbers  on
  the other.

From this theoretical basis South  Africa,  and  the  way  of  life  of  its
people, was restructured in a manner that was unprecedented in  history.  It
is out of that past that our Presidency is tasked to lead  our  nation.  We,
in the ANC, acknowledge and appreciate the  wisdom  of  the  new  integrated
Presidency and the new rational clustering of ministries so as  to  optimise
their functioning as they tackle the  different  tasks  in  the  process  of
transforming our country into a fully-fledged developmental democracy.

However, this is not enough. This Parliament needs  to  fashion  and  create
legal instruments that would assist the  Presidency  and  its  ministers  in
tackling the challenges  ahead.  Of  course,  our  Parliament  has  done  an
appreciable amount of work in  this  regard.  The  various  pieces  of  land
reform legislation, the labour Acts,  the  Preferential  Procurement  Policy
Framework Act, the big environmental Acts, the water and forestry Acts,  the
Promotion of Equality and  Prevention  of  Unfair  Discrimination  Act  and,
lastly, the Mineral Development Bill that was recently tabled, are all  part
of the arsenal that the Presidency and its  Ministers  need  to  remove  our
country from its painful past, the past of colonialism  of  a  special  type
that is apartheid.

We in the ANC know, and we knew long before we came  into  power,  that  the
process of transformation from the old order to the new cannot be a  smooth-
sailing process. We have often seen that, even  in  this  Chamber,  when  we
deliberate  legislation  which  aims  at  facilitating  transformation.  The
scepticism that we often see does not surprise us. In  fact,  it  vindicates
what Franz Fanon says in his book, The Wretched of the Earth, when he  deals
with national liberation, decolonisation and the imperative  of  change.  He
says, and I quote:


  The need for this  change  exists  in  its  crude  state,  impetuous  and
  compelling, in the consciousness and in the lives of the  men  and  women
  who  are  colonised.  But  the  possibility  of  the  change  is  equally
  experienced in the form of a terrifying future in  the  consciousness  of
  another ``species'' of men and women, the colonisers.

That is the essence of our  contradiction  in  this  country.  That  is  the
essence of the antagonistic reflection we often see in this Parliament.
However, we are guided by wise and tested leadership  in  Comrade  President
Thabo Mbeki, and Deputy President Comrade Jacob Zuma. [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, hon President, hon  Deputy  President,  hon
Ministers and colleagues, the MF supports this Vote and I  convey  the  best
wishes of the leader of the MF, Mr A Rajbansi, to  the  hon  the  President,
the hon the Minister in the Presidency, the Deputy President  and  Dr  Yusuf
Pahad.

Ever since  the  historic  election  that  took  place  in  1994  tremendous
achievement can be recorded, as  the  field  is  slowly  being  levelled  in
favour of the long-suffering masses. The MF commends the President  and  his
Deputy for the roles both of them are  playing  for  the  benefit  of  South
Africa and Africa in the international arena. It is understandable that  our
Government is doing its best to restore our country from the damages of  the
past and to level the playing field in meeting the needs of the people,  and
delivering on its commitment by providing a better life for all.

The high praise the hon the President received during his  recent  visit  to
the UK and the efforts that were made during  the  visit  for  the  economic
upliftment of our country require  mention  in  this  honourable  House.  In
later years, when South Africa emerges as an economic giant  from  its  long
era of suppression, these exercises will go down in history, and it will  be
noted that the strong foundations were laid by our  hon  President  and  his
team. We should  ignore  an  artificial  pipsqueak  who  has  the  habit  of
criticising everything the Government does.

The MF is very appreciative of the fact that the hon  the  Deputy  President
deals with matters relating to urban  renewal,  traditional  leadership  and
the Commission on Religious, Cultural and Minority Rights. In  this  respect
the MF requests the hon the President to consider establishing this for  the
minorities or creating a Ministry and  department  for  religious,  cultural
and minority rights,  and  to  consider  legislation  in  respect  of  these
aspects.

We further compliment the  Presidency  on  the  role  it  plays  in  matters
relating to the youth, the disabled, gender and  children.  Children  should
be elevated and should  be  referred  to  not  as  children,  but  as  child
citizens.

Stocktaking shows that apartheid left us with  a  bankrupt  state  in  1994.
Great strides have  been  made  on  all  fronts  and  we  express  our  deep
appreciation for the guidance  given  by  the  Presidency  in  piloting  our
freedom ship through  these  stormy  waters.  The  MF  supports  this  Vote.
[Applause.]

Mr J J KGARIMETSA: Chairperson, hon President,  hon  Deputy  President,  hon
members, ... [Laughter] ... the people-centred character of the ANC  is  the
basis  on  which  our  Government  adopts  policies  and   programmes   that
prioritise issues affecting the poorest of the  poor  in  our  country,  the
majority of whom live in rural areas.
This is not an ordinary movement. It is a  movement  with  a  vision  and  a
mission. [Applause.] The ANC-led Government's  attitude  of  putting  people
first - Batho Pele - dates back to the historic  Freedom  Charter  of  1955,
and has been carried out through the 50th Mafikeng Resolution of 1997.

The Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Strategy is but one measure  to
demonstrate the unwavering commitment by the ANC-led Government to  creating
a better life for all.

The Presidency needs to be commended for the leadership it has  demonstrated
by  initiating  the  integrated  development  programmes  that   are   based
primarily  on  the  principles  and  values  of  poverty  eradication.   The
identification of the developmental nodes  in  rural  communities,  and  the
realignment  of  infrastructure  programmes,  such   as   the   consolidated
municipal infrastructure programme, to have a rural  bias  demonstrates  the
commitment of this Government to uplift the rural poor.

 We see the integrated rural development programme as adding  value  to  the
new system of local government, which requires a developmental  approach  to
delivery of service. An important  feature  of  the  Integrated  Sustainable
Rural Development Strategy is its co-operative nature that goes  beyond  the
Government  to  encourage  communities  to  unite  in  action  for   change.
[Applause.]

Through this call and the new system of local government, even  the  poorest
rural communities have been  presented  with  a  rare  opportunity  to  take
charge of their destiny and shape the future of their children  as  well  as
an opportunity to join  the  fight  against  poverty  and  underdevelopment,
speed up change and, again, create a better life for all. [Applause.]

Therefore, traditional leaders are central in  leading  the  involvement  of
communities in  the  development  programmes  during  the  local  government
transformation process. The ANC-led Government continues  to  recognise  the
leadership  of  the  institution  of  traditional  leaders  as  central   in
facilitating  development  and  the  implementation  of  rural   development
programmes. We continue to make an  effort  to  restore  their  respect  and
dignity. [Applause.]

The President has shown a serious commitment to the question of  traditional
leaders and we are glad that very soon the Bill on how  traditional  leaders
will participate in the  new  municipal  structure  will  be  introduced  in
Parliament.

We understand, however, that this will not be the end of  the  process.  The
people-driven White Paper process will still continue to involve  all  South
Africans to determine the role and place of the institution  of  traditional
leaders in a democratic, non-racial and non-sexist society.

The most important task, that of reviewing about 1 500 apartheid  laws  that
sought  to  undermine  the  dignity  of  traditional   leaders   and   their
institutions, is also under way. The issue of  traditional  leaders  touches
on governance, democracy  and  development.  It  is  not  a  debate  between
Government and traditional leaders, but a matter that affects all  citizens,
and should be dealt with in the context of local government transformation.

We still see traditional leaders as symbols of unity in  the  community,  as
spokespersons of their communities, as custodians and protectors of  customs
and general welfare. They still have a duty to advise Government  on  issues
affecting traditional leaders through the House of Traditional Leaders  that
has been established by this democratic Government. [Applause.]

[When one works hard, one does it for one's community. South Africa  is  our
home. To be united in deed brings changes and improves people's lives.  This
is the hon the President's song, especially to the people who live in  rural
areas. We appreciate his words.

The Chairperson of the House of  Traditional  Leaders  in  the  North  West,
Chief Motsatsi, works co-operatively with nurses and  his  community.  Every
week statistics of people affected by Aids are  conducted,  and  people  are
taught how to prevent this disease. Unity is power.]

This is unity in action for change. [Applause.]

[Again in the North West, the Chief of the Bakgatle ba Kgafela has  a  great
task of negotiating with and teaching his community how they  can  use  part
of their land as tourist attraction sites to reduce  unemployment.  He  does
this in collaboration with members of Parliament. We stand here  to  support
traditional leaders, and we can do  this  until  the  sun  sets.  Blessings!
[Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, hon President, hon Deputy President, the  hon  the
Leader of the Opposition boasted in his speech that  in  the  DA,  the  buck
stops at the top. I can better him on that one: in the case of  the  AEB  it
also starts at the top. [Laughter.]

As the topic of this debate is the Presidency, and not only  the  President,
I also have a word or two for the Deputy President.  I  want  to  make  some
positive remarks regarding the Deputy  President  from   the  bottom  of  my
heart. I want to mention the way in  which  he  handles  questions  in  this
House. Whilst other Ministers get rude when they do not know the answer,  he
has adopted that infallible tactic, the little Zuma laugh. [Laughter.]

Personally, I appreciate the  sessions  he  has,  as  Leader  of  Government
Business, with party leaders in Tuynhuys. I think we must build  further  on
that. And lastly, most importantly, I wish to express  my  appreciation  for
the emphasis the Deputy President regularly  places  on  the  importance  of
moral values, discipline and a sober  way  of  life,  as  was  reported  for
instance in respect of the speech he made on Youth Day.

Aangesien mnr Essop Pahad die Minister in die Presidensie is  en  hy  vandag
verjaar, is dit seker gepas as ek hom van harte gelukwens. Die AEB  kry  hom
jammer. Nie net kruip die son agter die maan  weg  as  hy  verjaar  nie,  sy
verjaardag is boonop ook die kortste dag  van  die  jaar,  en  dít  noem  ek
diskriminasie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[As Mr Essop Pahad is the Minister  in  the  Presidency  and  today  is  his
birthday, it is probably appropriate if I congratulate him  most  sincerely.
The AEB feels sorry for him.  Not only does the sun hide behind the moon  on
his birthday, but his birthday is also the shortest day of the year,  and  I
call that discrimination.]

The President specifically referred to white people in his speech. He  said:
``No  white  person  must  feel  marginalised,  disempowered,  violated   or
dispossessed from what they hold dear.'' I must report to him today that  at
the moment, this is exactly the case. Yes, some of those perceptions can  be
contributed to the loss of power and privilege, the inevitable  consequences
of sharing the cake equally among all people of South  Africa  and  to  mere
apartheid nostalgia. But, Mr President, this will be our focus today.

A lot of the very perceptions the President  does  not  want  alive  amongst
white people, marginalisation, disempowerment  and   dispossession,  can  be
attributed not  necessarily  to  the  content,  but  to  the  style  of  his
Presidency. While South Africa  is  portrayed  as  a  country  for  all  its
people, a lot of them have the impression that he is not the  President  for
all the people, or should  I  say  peoples.  A  significant  part  of  South
Africans feel alienated and marginalised, not least by the  impression  they
have of the President as someone who plays his cards close to his chest.  We
perceive a lack of conscious reasoning out for our people.

Ons ervaar dit as hy, heeltemal tereg, die bedroefde  moeder  van  'n  swart
jeugdige besoek en vertroos, maar  die  bedroefde  agtergeblewenes  van  die
talle boere wat so brutaal  en  wreedaardig  vermoor  word,  verbygaan.  Ons
ervaar dit as hy 'n krans lê by die dam waar die jong  seun  se  lyk  gegooi
is, maar  nie  'n  oomblik  verpoos  by  die  plek  'n  paar  honderd  meter
daarvandaan by dieselfde dam nie, waar 'n wit man twee weke  vroeër  vermoor
en sy dogter verkrag is toe hulle gekampeer en visgevang het.

Dan begin ons vra of die tweenasie-teorie nie dalk tog meer is  as  net  die
konstatering van 'n realiteit nie. Ons het dit  ervaar  met  die  krisis  in
Zimbabwe. Ja, ons het begrip daarvoor dat die President  mnr  Mugabe  eerder
wou bearbei en nie ``bemoerbei'' nie, dat hy hom nie aan die  een  kant  tot
nugterheid kan oorreed  en  terselfdertyd  in  die  openbaar  teen  hom  kan
uitvaar nie. Ons het begrip daarvoor. Dit is net 'n kat wat tegelyk kan  vry
en baklei, maar hoekom moes ons so lank wag voordat hy ons mense  se  vrese,
gegrond of ongegrond, besweer het en duidelik verklaar het dat  dit  duskant
die Limpopo anders sal wees?

 Dit het te lank geduur voordat die Minister vir Landbou  en  Grondsake  ons
mense  die  waarborg  gegee  het  dat  kaart  en  transport  in  Suid-Afrika
eerbiedig sal word en dat daar sterk teen plaasbesetters opgetree sal  word.
Dit is ook nie net ons wat dit ervaar het nie, maar ook die buiteland,  soos
destyds in die val van die rand weerspieël is.

Ons ervaar dit as die  President  hom  bedien  van  die  tweelingboetie  van
rassisme, naamlik stereotipering en veralgemening wanneer hy in  'n  oorsese
onderhoud die breë verfkwas gebruik en blankes in  Suid-Afrika  stereotipeer
asof hulle álmal neersien op swartes as lui, onbetroubaar en onbekwaam.  Ons
ervaar dit as ons tydens elke groot toespraak van hom hoor dat die  beloofde
artikel 185-kommissie vir die regte van minderhede aan die kom is,  en  daar
steeds niks gebeur nie.

Ons  ervaar  dit  as   hy   in   gesprek   tree   met   sekere   uitgesoekte
Afrikanergroeperings en die ander verbygaan. Ons ervaar dit as  ons  daarvan
moet kennis neem dat die beloofde lessenaar vir Afrikaans steeds nie  in  sy
kantoor gevestig is nie. Ons ervaar dit as ons jongmense met  leë  hande  by
werkverskaffingsagente moet omdraai ná hulle gehoor het hulle is te wit.
Ons ervaar dit as ons deur 'n senior Minister van die  Kabinet  vertel  word
dat die handhawing van Afrikaans op universiteit 'n blokkasie vir  omvorming
is, dat die onderhouding van 'n bepaalde Christelike etos en  karakter  daar
ongrondwetlik is, dat Christelike godsdiensonderrig op skool moet plek  maak
vir 'n algemeen-neutrale vergelykende studie, dat ons geskiedenis só  besmet
is dat elke simbool daarvan verwyder moet word, al is dit in  die  naam  van
'n skool.

Ons ervaar dit as elke konferensie en elke debat oor rassisme ontaard in  'n
``who's who'' van ``the good, the bad and the  ugly''  met  blankes,  en  by
uitstek Afrikaners, as ``the bad and the ugly''. (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[We experience it when he, quite rightly, visits and comforts  the  grieving
mother of a black youth but passes by the grieving  relatives  of  the  many
farmers who are so brutally and cruelly murdered. We experience it  when  he
lays a wreath at the dam where the young boy's body was left, but  does  not
stand for a moment at the place a few hundred metres away at  the  same  dam
where a white man was murdered and his  daughter  raped  two  weeks  earlier
while they were camping and fishing.

We then begin to ask whether the two nations  theory  is  not  perhaps  more
than just a statement of reality. We  experienced  it  with  the  crisis  in
Zimbabwe. Yes, we understand that the President  preferred  to  persuade  Mr
Mugabe and not confront [``bemoerbei''] him, that he could not bring him  to
reason on the one hand and at the same time  denounce  him  in  public.   We
understand that.  Only a cat can love and fight at the same  time,  but  why
did we have to wait so long before  he  allayed  our  people's  fears,  wel-
founded or not, and clearly stated that things would be  different  on  this
side of the Limpopo?

It took too long before the Minister for Agriculture and Land  Affairs  gave
our people the guarantee that title deeds would be honoured in South  Africa
and that strong action would be taken against farm invaders.  This  was  not
only experienced by us, but also abroad, as was reflected  in  the  fall  in
the value of the rand at the time.

We experience it when the  President  makes  use  of  the  twin  brother  of
racism, namely stereotyping and generalisation, when he uses a  broad  brush
in an interview abroad and stereotypes whites  in  South  Africa  as  though
they all look down on  blacks  as  lazy,  unreliable  and  incompetent.   We
experience it when, during  each  big  speech  of  his,  we  hear  that  the
promised section 185 commission for the rights of  minorities  is  imminent,
and yet nothing happens.

We experience it when he  enters  into  discussions  with  certain  selected
Afrikaner groupings and passes the others by. We experience it when we  have
to  learn  that  the  promised  desk  for  Afrikaans  has  still  not   been
established in his office.  We experience  it  when  our  young  people  are
turned away with empty hands at employment agencies after  they  have  heard
that they are too white.

We experience it when we are told by a senior Minister of the  Cabinet  that
the  maintenance  of   Afrikaans   at   university   is   an   obstacle   to
transformation, that the maintenance of a  particular  Christian  ethos  and
character there is unconstitutional, that  Christian  religious  instruction
at school must make way for a general, neutral comparative study,  that  our
history is so tainted that every symbol thereof must be removed, even if  it
is in the name of a school.

We  experience  it  when  every  conference  and  every  debate  on   racism
degenerates into a ``who's who'' of ``the good,  the  bad  and  ugly''  with
whites, and Afrikaners in particular, as ``the bad and the ugly''.]

This is the marginalisation, disempowerment and  dispossession  of  what  is
dearest to us, exactly what he said in his speech should not happen.

Dan gebeur dit met die President dat ook Afrikaners  nie  meer  gedryf  word
deur hul skoon ideale en aspirasies nie, maar uit vrees en onsekerheid  gryp
hulle na die strooihalm van ``fight back''. [It then also happens  with  the
President that Afrikaners too are no longer driven by their pure ideals  and
aspirations, but out of fear and uncertainty they  grasp  at  the  straw  of
``fight back''.]

I call upon the President to ensure that the next term of his Presidency  is
characterised  by  showing  positively  that  he  really  wants  to  be  the
President of all our people.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, before  you  leave,
can you just clarify what you meant when you said, ``contributed to us''?  I
suppose you meant, ``attributed to us''.

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, maybe. [Laughter.]

Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs M C LOBE: Hon Chairperson, during the 1999 and 2000 elections, the  ANC
called upon all the citizens of South Africa, in  general,  that  we  should
all  fight  for  change.  Change  from  the  slavery  of  poverty,   hunger,
joblessness and the challenges that we are facing today.

Therefore, we gladly accept the  President's  plea  for  unity  and  working
together for change, because in  Sesotho  we  have  a  saying  that  two  is
stronger than one, and unity builds strength.]

Our society as a whole should be  engaged  in  a  process  of  fundamentally
transforming our country, with the specific focus on poverty eradication,  a
scourge that still affects millions of our  people.  Poverty  in  the  South
African context is historically, economically  and  socially  characterised.
It  therefore  includes  inadequate  access  to  nutrition,  health,  water,
sanitation, housing, education, employment, information, etc.

We must state that the youth, women, disabled and rural people are the  most
neglected  sectors,  the  majority  of  whom,  as  a  result  of  systematic
marginalisation, find themselves living in poverty. For example,  about  72%
of African women who live in rural areas are poor and underdeveloped. It  is
in the light of this fact that we welcome the  Integrated  Sstainable  Rural
Development Strategy. We feel that the  nodal  points  have  been  carefully
chosen, for example the Qwaqwa  district  municipality  in  the  Free  State
indisputably suffers from an economic depression.

[We welcome the good work done by the  Presidency  up  to  this  point.  For
example,  during  the  last  six  years  Mapheelo  Pheko,  an  old  lady  at
Botshabelo, fetched water from a little dam six kilometres  from  where  she
lives. She lived in a shack and used paraffin to cook. However,  because  of
this Presidency, I am proud to say that she has been given a house  to  live
in, for the first time in her life, a water tap in her yard and  electricity
in her house. This has brought her back her human dignity.

However, there is something that still bothers the people of Botshabelo  and
of many other places in South Africa. That is the use of the  bucket  system
in their toilets. This system is really belittling the dignity that we  have
brought back to old Mrs Pheko, and it is also the  cause  of  many  diseases
among the citizens and local government workers. We have  to  quickly  bring
this system to a halt, as one of the ways of fighting poverty.

This talk of working on this project over 100  years  really  belittles  the
progress that we have accomplished so far, and I would like to bring to  the
attention of the Presidency that we need to make haste. [Applause.]]

Although the Presidency has been consistently pointing to  the  rural  areas
as the focal point of development, recognition has also been  given  to  the
fact that apartheid has fundamentally  damaged  the  spatial,  economic  and
social environment in which our people  live  in  urban  areas.  Hence,  the
initiative of the Urban Renewal Strategy  as  a  mechanism  to  fight  urban
decay and poverty.

Alexandra township poses a particular challenge to  the  Government,  as  it
displays poverty in a glaring manner. We appreciate the  R1,3  billion  that
the Government has set aside for infrastructural development in  this  area.
We see this integrated  development  programme  as  a  way  to  restore  the
respect and dignity of poor people and to build a better life for all.

We note with appreciation the integrated poverty relief programme  which  is
funded from the poverty relief infrastructure  and  job  creation  fund.  It
should target the poorest areas in the provinces, promote human  development
and build capacity among the poor and unemployed.  It  should  also  provide
jobs and impact on households where single women are the main  breadwinners.
Lastly, it must seek to make community-based projects sustainable.

The multisectoral nature of the integrated  development  programmes  of  the
Presidency in a way facilitates  the  concept  of  co-operative  governance,
where departments and  all  spheres  of  government  are  required  to  work
together and form partnerships with communities.  This  is  consistent  with
the  ANC  message,  which  is  ``together  fighting   for   change''.   This
partnership can only be realised at local  level  because  it  is  at  local
government level that our entire system of governance delivers  services  to
the people. The introduction of  a  new  framework  of  developmental  local
government presents substantial opportunities to address the  challenges  of
poverty.

of Sesotho paragraph follows.)

[Our main intention in this matter, has to be the correct administration  of
the  fight  against  poverty,  for  development  and  self-empowerment   and
experience in the three spheres of governance, in a united manner.  However,
we must hasten this fight against poverty because the last one to move  gets
the least.]

The fundamental element in the unity for change is participatory  democracy.
Communities are the  subject  of  all  Government  policies  and  should  be
allowed to own the fight against poverty. The  Local  Government:  Municipal
Systems Act provides a mechanism  in  this  regard.  It  stipulates  that  a
municipality  must  develop  a  culture   of   municipal   governance   that
complements formal representative government with a system of  participatory
governance.

Key to  fulfilling  the  developmental  role  of  local  government  is  the
drafting and adoption of integrated development plans, in  which,  in  terms
of the law, communities  must  have  a  say  in  the  content  and  drafting
process. This is the Freedom Charter in action. Indeed,  Comrade  President,
the people govern.

Batho ba busa. [The people do rule.]

Undoubtedly, the poorest of the poor welcome the  announcement  by  the  hon
the President in September 2000 about the provision of free basic  services.
The December 2000 elections bear testimony to this. Seventy percent  of  our
municipalities are under the  capable  leadership  of  the  ANC.  The  basic
effect of the free basic services is that people's respect and dignity  will
be restored.

Without any further elaboration, it should  be  clear  in  everybody's  mind
that the provision of  free  basic  services  contributes  directly  to  the
eradication of poverty. We should urge all stakeholders in  this  regard  to
accelerate the process of implementing this noble concept.

We welcome Comrade President's integrated approach  to  poverty  eradication
which, among  other  things,  entails  investment  in  economic  and  social
infrastructure. We are  confident  that  together  we  will  win  the  fight
against poverty. We should agree that this process will  take  a  long  time
and that it will be as a result of intense struggle, a  consequence  of  our
people taking their destiny into their own hands, uniting in action  against
poverty.

In this instance, the President's performance will  be  judged  against  the
Freedom Charter by the masses of our people,  not  by  what  the  opposition
thinks or says. In the light of this fact, we as the ANC  believe  that  the
President's programme and work are in line  with  this  important  document.
[Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Chairperson, hon President, hon Deputy  President  and  hon
members, much praise has been given. I would like to quote from  the  speech
of Deputy President Jacob Zuma on Youth Day, when  he  said:  ``We  need  an
angry young youth.'' The question today is: Who should the  youth  be  angry
with? Who is failing them? [Interjections.]

If  we  look  at  the  main  challenges   facing   South   Africans:   Aids,
unemployment, crime and education, the  blame  must  surely  rest  with  the
Government. [Interjections.] It is a government with too much talk  and  not
enough action to improve the lives of all South  Africans.  [Interjections.]
We need a sober, well-focused, responsible and energetic youth to  secure  a
better future for all South African citizens. This kind of youth we  salute.
Blind anger, rhetoric and slogans will bring them no closer to success.  Our
youth are definitely capable of  rising  above  the  angry  sound  and  fury
signifying nothing but self-defeating arrogance.

It is worth repeating that staggering numbers of young  South  Africans  are
being lost to Aids. It is estimated that at least 4 million  South  Africans
are living with HIV/Aids, the highest incidence being amongst adolescents  -
a staggering 65,4%. The Government is failing, because our country does  not
have an Aids programme that is destined to succeed. [Interjections.]

Our efforts at prevention are not sharply focused and  are  badly  led.  The
Government continues to refuse to contemplate  a  new  radical  approach  to
treatment. There is no detailed plan for looking after the families  of  all
who fall victim to Aids, rubbing salt into the wounds.   The  South  African
Government, and all South Africans for that matter, need to  listen  to  the
voices of people  like  sister  Ruth  Bhengu,  brother  Lucky  Mazibuko  and
brother Zackie Achmat.

 A well-funded health budget is very critical.  The  working  conditions  of
doctors and nurses and as well as that of other support  staff  need  to  be
improved, undergirded by a sufficient budget to maintain high  standards  of
efficiency and professionalism.
If we look at education, according to the Auditor-General's report,  schools
do not only lack basic facilities  such  as  electricity,  but  also  suffer
owing to teacher absenteeism and a lack of textbooks.  We,  however,  salute
the dedicated teachers. Only 55% of learners are passing matric.  What  sort
of future is in store for our young people who pass, year in and  year  out,
but face the bleak future of unemployment?

At the same time, South Africa is losing talent and  skills  as  more  young
people leave for foreign countries and a safer environment.  And  while  our
youth's prospects for a successful future begin to drift even  further  from
their reach, the leadership of this country has  lost  itself  in  political
discourse that obsesses about marginal issues.

Harping on about the obvious ills like  apartheid  and  racism  -  selective
racism, I must say - can no longer  be  an  excuse  by  Government  for  the
snail's pace of delivery or outright  nondelivery.  Accelerated  sustainable
delivery should be visible to all.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! There  is  a  point  of  order.
Yes, hon member?

Ms N E HANGANA: Chairperson, Mr Seremane should tell  us  what  the  Western
Cape has done in terms of delivery. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order,  hon  member,  that  is  not  a
point of order. [Interjections.] Order! Proceed, hon Seremane.

Mr W J SEREMANE: Chairperson, I  shall  ignore  that.  [Interjections.]  The
President is legitimately in Government and has been  given  the  tools  and
levers by the electorate to serve all South Africans, not just a few  select
loyalists. By any means, he must do the job.

Crime is taking its toll on the youth. The youth are  targets  and  some  of
them are also beginning to be perpetrators. Crime is  strangling  our  youth
and society as a whole. Is it  because  valuable  policemen  and  women  are
inadequately paid and that  there  is  a  lack  of  tools  to  do  the  job?
[Interjections.] More than sabre rattling, the Government must  empower  and
resource our police force adequately. Criminals do  not  take  the  Minister
seriously with his verbal sabre rattling.

May I please pass on a message of gratitude, somewhat belatedly ...

one wants to kill a tiger, one will hear it when  one  brings  it  here.  In

Mr W J SEREMANE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I would  like  to  know
whether respect for members in the House is selective or given to  all,  for
we address each other as ``hon'', not just by name. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, it is a practice here to  refer  to  people
as ``hon'' whatever the name is. Will you  do  that  please.  It  is  not  a
selective choice. Hon Tolo, would you please continue your speech, but  will
you just refer to the member you referred to as ``hon''.

(Translation of Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[Bishop L J TOLO: Thank you, Madam Speaker,  the  lizard  has  taken  refuge
under the rocks and some able-bodied men are toiling to get it out!

I want to elaborate on why I say the ANC is on track.  I  am  standing  here
today representing  ministers  of  the  African  independent  churches  that
seceded from mainstream Protestantism in 1874. According  to  Romans  16:16,
it was the tradition in Christian circles that  after  a  convert  had  been
baptised, members of the congregation then  embraced   one  another  with  a
holy kiss as a sign of peace. However, when we tried  to  embrace  and  kiss
the likes of Pretorius and company they refused, saying  that  for  them  to
embrace and kiss blacks in church was anathema. That is why  we  broke  away
from mainstream Protestantism and formed our own independent  churches.  May
I say that  the  decision  by  the  ANC-led  Government  to  make  religious
tolerance mandatory, especially in rural areas  where  numerous  independent
churches have been established, is an important factor. The previous  regime
neither recognised nor acknowledged their existence. The  ANC  is  indeed  a
God-fearing organisation.

I just want to illustrate how  this  is  justified  by  the  Scriptures.  In
Paul's letter to the Corinthians it is said that we are  all  God's  people.
And the ANC is saying that we are all equal; we are one family.  [Applause.]
This letter to the Corinthians reminds me of the late Andries Treurnicht.  I
am  told  the  fellow  was  himself  a  former  church  minister.   However,
custodians of the ignoble doctrine of apartheid, who  are  the  predecessors
of the Democratic Alliance which currently comprises the New NP and the  DP,
manipulated his mindset to the extent  that  he  firmly  believed  that  the
Almighty God he worshipped was not  the  same  Almighty  God  worshipped  by
blacks. Quite frankly, he even suffered a fatal stroke.

Some leaders  of  various  independent  churches  whose  membership  is  the
largest in rural areas -  estimated  at  more  than  six  to  eight  million
followers - are happy and contented with the leadership of our President  as
head of state. Surely, they are going to vote for the ANC again and again  -
in 2004, in 2008, and ad infinitum! [Applause.]

When the ANC disagreed with some political parties that  were  lobbying  for
the return of the death penalty we were roundly condemned for doing so.  The
Bible says: Do not commit murder! I would say that the manner in  which  the
ANC-led Government is managing the affairs of this country is in  accordance
with what the Holy Scriptures prescribe.

Hon members can rest  assured  that  I  and  other  leaders  of  independent
churches are very happy when the ANC says that we are  legitimate  ministers
of the Word of God. According to the Democratic Alliance preachers are  only
those who have undergone theological academic training.  Anyone  else  is  a
nonentity. In Paul's first  letter  to  the  Corinthians  it  is  said  that
everyone has been given the wisdom to be a preacher  by  God.  This  clearly
shows that the ANC recognises the fact that some people were blessed by  God
with the wisdom to be preachers of His Word.

Before my speaking time expires, I just want to remind hon members  and  the
President that I am one of  those  who  lives  in  a  rural  village.  After
attaining our political freedom I thought of leaving my  rural  village  for
town life. If my father were raised up from the dead today and came  to  see
where I am staying, he will definitely run away  when  he  sees  the  bright
lights all over the homestead. He will indeed be greatly astonished and  not
know where he is. He may think that he is in town.]

Ek het so gereken: Noudat ons vryheid gekry het, wil ek  in  die  dorp  gaan
woon want daar is genoeg beligting. Maar noudat die ANC 'n  wonderlike  ding
gedoen het, gaan ek glad nie meer verhuis en in die dorp woon nie.  Ek  gaan
maar in die landelike gebiede bly woon. [Applous.] [I  thought  as  follows:
Now that we have our freedom, I want to move  to  town,  because  there  are
enough lights. But now that the ANC has done a wonderful thing,  I  will  no
longer  be  moving  to  town.  I  will  remain  here  in  the  rural  areas.
[Applause.]

[Someone who flew over the countryside of  Lydenburg  at  night  during  the
apartheid era, might have noticed a vast difference  in  infrastructure  and
delivery when he looked down. Where one saw some  very  bright  lights,  one
would know that the plane was flying  over  a  lily-white  town  where  only
white people lived; where one saw isolated lights here and there,  one  knew
that those were  white-owned  farmsteads,  whilst  the  areas  inhabited  by
blacks remained engulfed in total darkness, even though we were required  by
law to pay taxes.  I  should  like  to  remind  members  of  the  Democratic
Alliance that today when one is flying over the countryside of Lydenburg  at
night and  one  looks  down,  one  will  see  no  difference  whatsoever  in
infrastructure, because all the places  are  now  equally  covered  in  very
bright lights. At long last we have piped water; we have electricity;  roads
are being built; we have telephones and we have no problems.  I,  and  those
who initially wanted to move into town, no longer desire to  do  so  because
we are now settled in peace and comfort. President Thabo  Mbeki  has  indeed
contributed massively to the furtherance of a better life for  all  in  this
country. If one were to watch a male baboon showing off  as  it  protects  a
group of female baboons from behind, with its  tail  held  high,  one  would
realise that nothing will ever harm them.

I hope that members of the Democratic Alliance are churchgoers. It would  be
proper for them to examine their consciences  and  agree  that  the  ANC  is
indeed doing the right thing. I want to elaborate  on  that:  In  the  rural
villages of Chief Kgoloko Tshola, Chief Ramaube and Chief  Riba,  roads  are
being built. This has come as a  great  wonderment  to  us  in  those  areas
because we have never seen these things before, least  of  all  dreamt  that
one day these things might happen to us.

It is worth mentioning that the reason why the hon Van Schalkwyk is  such  a
strong, healthy and handsome young man could be that he  was  a  beneficiary
of the previous regime's taxes that were paid by our fathers at a time  when
we were suffering greatly. [Laughter.] [Applause.]]

Mr R S SCHOEMAN: Madam Speaker, hon President,  hon  Deputy  President,  hon
members, before continuing with my prepared speech, I wish to refer  briefly
to the earlier participation by the hon Dr Manie Schoeman.  [Interjections.]
He is the new Eastern Cape mascot of the ANC and I want to say to  him  that
his arguments here today were as unconvincing as they were predictable.

It is also a pity that Dr Schoeman tried  to  use  an  important  debate  to
fight the fights he had lost in his former party and to try to  justify  his
joining the ANC in such a clumsy and inept way.  [Interjections.]  The  fact
that Dr Schoeman was for a long time  perceived  in  the  New  NP  to  be  a
rightwinger, who might actually join the FF rather than the ANC,  makes  his
performance here today even  less  credible.  [Interjections.]  I  say  this
because little more than a year ago, on 13 March 2000,  Dr  Schoeman,  in  a
media statement, had this to say about the ANC:


  Die stelling dat die Nuwe NP en die ANC ideologies nie veel verskil  nie,
  is 'n absolute wanvoorstelling en nooit deur my gesê nie.  Natuurlik  bly
  die ANC die Nuwe NP se hoofopponent.

Hy gaan dan voort en noem fundamentele ideologiese verskille tussen  hom  as
Nuwe NP-lid  en  die  ANC,  en  dit  sluit  die  volgende  in:  federalisme,
effektiewe beskerming van minderheidsregte en taalregte, en, hoewel die  ANC
ekonomies na die Nuwe  NP  se  posisie  beweeg  het,  is  daar  volgens  hom
wesenlike verskille, soos onder meer oor sekere  bepalings  in  die  huidige
arbeidswetgewing. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[He then went on to  mention  fundamental  ideological  differences  between
himself as a New NP member and the ANC, and these  included  the  following:
Federalism, effective protection of minority  rights  and  language  rights,
and, although the ANC has moved towards the New NP's position  economically,
he claims that there were fundamental  differences,  inter  alia,  regarding
certain provisions in the present labour legislation.]

I also recall that after the formation of the DA, Dr Schoeman said  that  if
the DA were to have the IFP or UDM on  board  as  well,  his  opposition  in
principle to the formation of the alliance about which he  had  so  much  to
say today would fall away. Now I want to ask: Where on  earth  is  logic  or
principle to be found in such  a  schizophrenic  position?  [Interjections.]
And for those hon members who do not know what  the  word  ``schizophrenic''
means, it means a split personality.
Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Madam Speaker,  would  the  hon  member  take  a  question?
[Interjections.]

Mr R S SCHOEMAN: It has been said that one fool can ask more questions  than
12 wise men can answer: No, I will not take a question.

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Madam Speaker, on a  point  of  order:  The  hon  Speaker
handed the very  incriminating  file  of  Dr  Delport's  information  to  Dr
Schoeman. Does he want that file back now? [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! I  want  to  remind  hon  members  that  if  they  raise
spurious  points  of  order  they  will  not  be   recognised   in   future.
[Interjections.] And, that applies to both sides of the House.

Mr R S SCHOEMAN: Madam Speaker, I would like to just  tell  the  House  that
that hon spurious member has always been renowned for his obscurity and  the
question that he has just asked today  is  just  another  example  of  that.
[Interjections.]

What we have been treated to, today,  is  the  spectacle  of  Dr  Schoeman's
bitter tirade and, I would add, tasteless personal attacks  against  the  DA
and its component parties and their leaders. I would best describe it  as  a
litany of distortions and misrepresentations which we reject and  which,  of
course, he presented here with a passion and a  zeal  which  can  only  come
from the lips of the newly joined, anxious to  prove  the  purity  of  their
motives and the sincerity of their commitment. [Interjections.]

However, I gladly leave the hon Dr Schoeman in the  tender  loving  care  of
the ANC. [Interjections.] [Applause.] And, I  am  really  very  disappointed
that I have in a way, had to waste  my  time  putting  the  record  straight
after  the   totally   pointless   participation   of   that   hon   member.
[Interjections.] I hope that he and the hon Johnny de Lange  are  on  better
terms with one another nowadays. [Laughter.]

Ek wil egter vir die agb Johnny de Lange sê ek dink daardie agb lid  het  'n
goeie klap nodig! [Tussenwerpsels.]  [However, I want  to  say  to  the  hon
Johnny de Lange that I think that that hon member needs a  good  hard  slap!
[Interjections.]]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members.

Mr R S SCHOEMAN: Madam Speaker, I wanted to say to the hon the  President  -
and I will send them my speech - that as far as the question of  inclusivity
in this country is concerned, it is threatened  by  the  whole  approach  of
majoritarianism, and that is the view that if the  majority  is  comfortable
it does not matter who is sidelined in the process. [Interjections.]

I want to appeal to the hon the President to set the example of respect  for
the views of those who differ from  the  ANC.  And,  to  remember  that  the
patriotism ``as being the true patriotism'' is of  no  party  and  that  the
questioning of the patriotism  of  the  opposition,  because  of  criticism,
should stop forthwith. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! [Interjections.]  Order!  This  appeal  for  order  also
applies to the Ministers in particular. Order! [Laughter.]

Mr D LOCKEY: Madam Speaker, it is a great honour and a privilege for  me  to
participate in this debate. Today, our President has  once  more  offered  a
vision of a  united  and  nonracial  South  Africa.  He  has  again  offered
reconciliation in a great spirit of  magnanimity.  Unfortunately,  this  was
met with scandalous opportunism and petty politicking on  the  part  of  the
DA. [Interjections.]

 It was Charles Dickens who once remarked that life  always  offers  one  an
opportunity to see the truth, no matter how blind or how prejudiced one  may
be. I do not think that Charles Dickens ever had such a  pathetic  bunch  of
people in mind when he made that statement. [Laughter.]

Earlier this year, our President quoted from the Millennium Declaration,  in
which the leaders of  the  world  undertook  to  take  special  measures  to
address the challenges of poverty eradication  and  sustainable  development
in Africa, including debt cancellation,  improved  market  access,  enhanced
official development assistance,  and  increased  flows  of  foreign  direct
investments and transfers of technology.

During the past two years our  President  and  our  Government  have  worked
tirelessly to establish  peace  and  stability  on  our  continent,  and  to
promote our country and our continent's interests in the global  arena.  The
hon Leon also referred to the many economic challenges that are  facing  our
country and continent. He unfortunately neglected to offer any solutions  to
these challenges.

I wish to argue today that South Africa's entry into the global  arena  runs
through Africa. Our  future  is  inextricably  linked  to  to  that  of  our
continent. South Africa's current trade surplus with  the  continent  stands
at approximately R20 billion. This figure is even more  significant  if  one
takes into account that the bulk of these exports is manufactured and  fully
beneficiated goods. This is in stark contrast to the fact that the  bulk  of
our exports to the rest of the world  is  predominantly  raw  materials  and
that we have a huge trade deficit with  many  of  our  other  major  trading
partners, including the EU, the USA and Asian countries.

The truth is that there are many jobs in this  country  that  are  sustained
through exports to the continent. If conditions could  be  created  for  the
continent to develop, then South Africa would flourish with it.  The  global
initiatives by our President are vital for the future  economic  growth  and
prosperity of South Africa. We  can  only  prepare  ourselves  if  we  fully
understand the dynamics that drive  the  process  of  globalisation  in  the
world today. Increasingly, the world is operating as  an  integrated  entity
on issues of trade, production and finance.

Globalisation has led  to  many  new  technologies  which  have  irrevocably
changed the production, financial and knowledge structures  of  the  world's
economy. Without access to these technologies a nation has very little  hope
of economic progress or survival. Globalisation  is  also  about  power  and
politics. The economically powerful nations of the  world  are  using  their
economic advantage to  manipulate  the  international  rules  on  trade  and
investment in their favour.

Globalisation is also about mass mobilisation of global  capital,  in  which
the market is supposed to  reign  supreme.  This  process  has  led  to  the
greatest inequalities that the world has ever seen. According to  the  UNDP,
the richest 20% of the world generates  86%  of  the  world's  products  and
accounts for 93% of its Internet use in 1999. The bottom 20%  of  the  world
generates only 1% of the world's products. The majority of these people  are
in sub-Saharan Africa. It is  against  this  background  that  we  as  South
Africa and Africa compete for trade  and  investment  opportunities  in  the
world.

One of the major achievements of the ANC Government  is  the  fact  that  we
have   successfully   transformed   the   debt-ridden,   uncompetitive   and
isolationist economy we inherited in  1994.  The  fact  speaks  for  itself.
Manufacturing exports have increased from 15% of output in 1994, to  28%  of
output last year. Our labour productivity increased by  30%  over  the  same
period. According to  the  global  competitiveness  report,  South  Africa's
position improved from 47 out of 49 countries, to 33rd out of  59  countries
surveyed last year. Through the EU, South Africa and  the  SADC  free  trade
agreements, our Government has created more opportunities than  ever  before
for greater market access for South African goods. [Interjections.]

 Despite these successes, the levels of direct foreign investment and  local
investments are disappointingly low, at 15% of GDP last  year.  This  matter
is a major challenge that must be addressed. Now  that  we  have  stabilised
the  country's  macroeconomics  and  are  now  focusing  more  and  more  on
microeconomic issues, we must pay greater attention to the higher levels  of
investments and higher levels of small, medium  and  micro-enterprises,  and
higher levels of Black Economic Empowerment.

We are also severely hampered by the  lack  of  a  level  playing  field  in
international trade. The world  today  is  dominated  by  the  economically-
powerful, to the exclusion of poor developing nations such as ourselves.  In
the areas where we can compete effectively, for example in  steel,  textiles
and agriculture, we have seen how developed countries have opted to  protect
their own narrow interests. The EU is protecting their  agriculture  through
subsidies and quotas, despite the fact that subsidies  are  regarded  as  an
unfair labour practice by the WTO. The US is protecting its  steel  industry
through so-called antidumping legislation.

Investment is the key to future economic growth  and  our  participation  in
the global economy, and our  President  has  spared  no  effort  to  try  to
attract higher levels of foreign direct investment to South  Africa  and  to
our continent. Investment is vital for capital  accumulation.  Through  such
capital accumulation jobs are created and new technologies developed.

Investment, trade and employment  enable  a  country  to  mobilise  savings.
There are many development  economists  who  argue  very  convincingly  that
investments precede savings. Investments  also  lead  to  higher  levels  of
exports,  which  in  turn  lead  to  higher  levels  of   economic   growth.
Investments also bring new skills and scarce management resources, which  we
were denied by the former regime, into a developing country such as us.

The big challenge for the African continent is how to attract higher  levels
of  investment.  This  represents  the  only  sustainable  solution  to  the
eradication of poverty, underdevelopment and unemployment that are  plaguing
our country and our continent.

Of the R827 billion in  foreign  direct  investment  in  1999,  Africa  only
attracted 1,3%, while it has 15% of the  world's  population.  According  to
Unctad the rates of return on investments of US companies in Africa are  the
highest in the world at 32,4%. This is nearly three times  as  high  as  the
average returns in South America. This situation can only be  attributed  to
the so-called Africa risk premium or Afropessimism.

It is clear that the dice are heavily  loaded  against  our  continent.  The
decision-making mechanisms in the bread-and-wood institutions must  also  be
revised. The US government commands a staggering 17,33% of the voting  power
in the IMF, and an 85% majority is required to amend  any  IMF  articles  of
agreement.

There are convincing arguments that the IMF today is the  de  facto  foreign
policy arm of the US government. For as  long  as  this  is  the  prevailing
state of affairs in the  world  economy,  we  have  very  little  chance  of
survival. We in the ANC  remain  committed  to  fighting  for  an  equitable
decision-making mechanism in these bodies.

I wish to conclude by saying if the DA really wants to make a  contribution,
they should help us to fight Afropessimism, they should  help  us  to  fight
the Africa risk premium and they should stop bad-mouthing South Africa  here
and abroad, like they did, once  more,  today.  They  should  assist  us  to
create a positive image of this country and to allow investors to  come  and
invest in this country. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, Minister Pahad will  hand  over  a  Braille
copy of  the  Budget  Speech  of  the  Minister  of  Finance  to  the  Joint
Monitoring Committee on Youth, Children and  People  with  Disabilities.  He
will hand it over to the President in the foyer  outside  the  Chamber.  You
are invited  to  participate  and  you  may  wish  to  sing  happy  birthday
afterwards. The President will reply tomorrow.

Debate interrupted.

5.    Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Defence  on  Study  Tour  to

        The Portfolio Committee on Defence, having undertaken a study  tour
        to Nigeria (together with members of the Joint  Standing  Committee
        on Defence) from 26 January to 2 February 2001, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction
         1. Objectives


              Nigeria and South Africa have many things in  common.  Nigeria
              experienced  military  oppressive  rule,  while  South  Africa
              experienced the oppressive system of Apartheid. Nigeria is the
              major military, economic and political force in  West  Africa,
              while South Africa is the major  force  in  its  region.  Both
              countries also support and work tirelessly  on  achieving  the
              ideals of the African Renaissance.


              The objectives were then  to  share  views  on  the  following
              issues:  Peace  support  operations,  post-Cold  War   defence
              management, force preparation, military education,  borderline
              control, parliamentary oversight, civil-military relations and
              defence industry.


         2. Courtesy calls


              Mr B Sifingo, SA High Commissioner; Lt-Gen  T  Danjuma  (rtd),
              Federal Minister of Defence; Mr S Lamido, Federal Minister  of
              Foreign Affairs; Sen A P Anyim, President of the Senate.


         3. Delegation


              The delegation consisted of Ms T R Modise (ANC MP  and  leader
              of delegation); Ms Z A Kota (ANC MP); Mr L V Ngculu (ANC  MP);
              Mr N L Diale (ANC MP); Mr P  J  Schalkwyk  (DP  MP);  Mr  N  S
              Middleton (IFP MP); Mr H A Smit (NNP MP); Mr M E  Mabeta  (UDM
              MP); and Mr G Campher, Committee Secretary.


     B.     Mr B Sifingo, SA High Commissioner


         The High Commissioner  briefed  the  delegation  on  the  political
         situation in Nigeria. He stated that Nigeria experienced one  civil
         war and six coups d'etat (the most in  Africa)  since  independence
         in 1960. Gen Olusegun Obasanjo became president after  winning  the
         presidential  elections  with  a  62%  majority.  His  party,   the
         People's Democratic Party, also attained majorities in both  Houses
         of Parliament. Parliament consisted of a 109-seat Senate and a 360-
         seat House of Representatives.


         Bilateral trade has been flourishing since 1994, and  in  1999,  at
         the  inaugural  session  of  the  South  Africa-Nigeria  Binational
         Commission  (BNC),  several  agreements   were   concluded,   which
         provided the legal framework for trade and  commerce,  between  the
         two countries. The trade balance favoured Nigeria,  but  it  should
         be borne in mind  that  South  African  exports  were  manufactured
         goods,  while  imports  from  Nigeria  were  primarily   commodity-
         related. Co-operation was also sought  outside  the  BNC  framework
         (i.e. the UN, the OAU and subregional organisations).


         The South Africa-Nigeria relationship is  central  to  our  foreign
         policy  and  the  realisation  of  the  African  Renaissance,  i.e.
         democratisation, addressing  regional  instabilities,  revitalising
         the various economies and transforming the various societies socio-
         politically.  In   addition,   as   South   Africa   becomes   more
         interventionist,  the  experiences  of  Nigeria  in   peace-keeping
         operations will be of use. The Foreign Affairs departments  of  the
         two countries will also have quarterly meetings to  discuss  issues
         and to co-ordinate policies and responses to existing and  emerging
         multilateral issues.


     C.     Minister of Defence


         The Minister, Lt-Gen (rtd) T Danjuma, welcomed  the  delegation  to
         Nigeria and gave a brief overview of  the  Nigerian  Armed  Forces'
         involvement in security operations. The armed forces  were  at  the
         time deployed in the south-east of the  country  due  to  a  border
         dispute with Cameroon over oil. A ceasefire  existed,  because  the
         case was referred to the World Court. In  the  north-east,  at  the
         border with Chad and Niger, troops were assisting the  police  with
         the problem of bandits terrorising civilians.  The  bulk  of  these
         troops were to be pulled out because of  the  operation's  success.
         Pockets of instability were also  experienced  due  to  intertribal
         conflict.


         Nigerian troops were recently  part  of  ECOMOG  [ECOWAS  (Economic
         Community of West African States) Monitoring group] in Liberia  and
         UNAMSIL (UN Mission  in  Sierra  Leone).  ECOMOG  consisted  of  11
         countries,  i.e.  Nigeria,  Gambia,  Ghana,  Niger,  Guinee,  Mali,
         Senegal, Sierra Leone,  Cote  D'Ivoire,  Benin  and  Burkino  Faso.
         Nigeria also performed peace support missions in the  former  USSR,
         Burundi and East Timor.


         The  Minister  said  that  the  proliferation  of  small  arms  was
         discussed in Mali at an OAU ministerial meeting. It  was  indicated
         that the police were unable to contain the problem,  as  they  were
         too small in size, ill-equipped and  outgunned  by  the  criminals.
         The problem with the use of troops to assist the  police  was  that
         troops  were  trained  to  use  maximum  force  when  dealing  with
         aggressors.   Police   training   will   be   upgraded   with   the
         establishment of more training schools, and  troops  will  also  be
         used as traffic regulators to free police to combat crime.


         The  Minister  stated  that  many  lessons  (e.g.  the  burden   of
         leadership) were learned in ECOMOG. The bulk  of  the  funding  and
         troops came from Nigeria, because it was the economic and  military
         leader in the subregion. Other lessons included the lack  of  rapid
         deployment capability, which led to logistical problems.


     D.     Permanent Secretary for Defence, Mr David Oyegun
         The Permanent Secretary  discussed  civil-military  relations  with
         the delegation. He stated that civil-military relations  in  modern
         times should seek to protect and sustain the features of  democracy
         which included, inter alia, the rule of law, freedom of  expression
         and of association,  religious  freedom,  participatory  governance
         and  collective  responsibility  on  the  part   of   the   general
         citizenry. In Nigeria, the long reign by  the  military  has  given
         the erroneous  impression  of  superiority  of  the  military  over
         civilians,  which  does  not  augur  well  for  the  sustenance  of
         democracy.


         It is important that civilians  and  the  military  understand  and
         accept  the  difference  between  democratic  and  military   rule.
         Democracy  is  consensual,  participatory,  emphasises  egalitarian
         principles and  celebrates  diversity  of  perspective,  while  the
         military is purposefully authoritarian and hierarchical.
         He stated that civil-military relations could  be  strengthened  by
         the following:


         1. Strong legislative and executive leadership, who understood  the
              constitutional role of the military.


         2.  Professionalisation,  down-sizing  and  restructuring  of   the
              military so as to achieve effective  civil  oversight  of  the
              military.


         3. The military should also participate in civil-military  seminars
              so as to reorientate their  psyche  towards  subordination  to
              civil rule.


         The experience in older democracies has shown that where  democracy
         is nurtured and allowed to grow by civil society and the  military,
         society grows.


         South Africa and Nigeria has the same past, i.e. oppression by  the
         military, with the exception that  in  South  Africa  the  military
         oppressed only the black majority. He added that even though he  as
         a civilian was the accounting officer and departmental head, as  is
         the case in  South  Africa,  in  certain  areas  the  military  was
         reluctant to accept civilian control.


         The  defence  budget  should  be  approved  by   both   Houses   of
         Parliament, before implementation. Sometimes this does not  happen,
         because of  tension  between  the  Executive  and  Parliament.  The
         policy was that funds allocated  for  certain  projects  should  be
         used for those projects, otherwise  authority  should  be  obtained
         from the Finance Minister and the President. However,  this  was  a
         cumbersome process. Constitutionally, the President  could  approve
         the budget within 30 days, but if more than 30 days  elapsed,  then
         Parliament should approve.


     E.     Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Admiral Ibrahim Ogohi


         The position of the CDS was rotated between the  different  service
         arms, unlike in South Africa, where it was normally  filled  by  an
         Army General. In Nigeria the  CDS  prepared  and  deployed  forces,
         while in South Africa, the Chief of the SANDF prepared the  forces,
         whilst the Chief of Joint Operations deployed the forces.


         The  Nigerian  armed  forces  learned   many   lessons   from   its
         international  peace-keeping  operations,   in   respect   of   the
         following:


         1. Burden of leadership.


         2. Experience of field commanders.


         3. Huge cost of military operations.


         4. Influence of press and international community.


         5. Magnitude of the unforeseen.


         6. External factors.


         7. Translating political decisions into military decisions.


         8. Need for proper planning and preparation


         In Sierra Leone  7 000  troops  had  to  be  financed  by  Nigeria,
         because the funding from the UN was  too  small.  The  UN  did  not
         refund these monies.


         The defence  industry  does  not  manufacture  most  of  the  local
         requirements (like South Africa), which  means  expensive  imports.
         Nigeria  also  has  a  problem  with  the  strategic  movement   of
         equipment, which makes the deployment of troops and equipment time-
         consuming and therefore more expensive.


         Maj-Gen J Garba  (rtd)  briefed  the  delegation  on  peace-keeping
         policies. He served as Foreign Minister  (1975-78),  Commandant  of
         the Nigerian Defence Academy, infantry division  commander  and  UN
         ambassador.


         He stated that there should be co-operation between the  Ministries
         of Defence and of Foreign Affairs, because  the  one  supplied  the
         troops, while the other does the diplomacy. However,  many  a  time
         the troop contingent was too small, too late or the government  was
         unable to withdraw the troops when they were drawn  into  conflict.
         Another problem, as in Liberia, was the lack of mandate,  when  the
         deployment  changed  character  (i.e.   peacekeeping   into   peace
         enforcement).


         The failure in Somalia could have been  prevented  if  the  warring
         parties were firstly disarmed so that the  strategic  and  tactical
         goals were achieved, whereafter humanitarian aid should  have  been
         provided. However,  as  soon  as  their  physiological  needs  were
         satisfied, conflict began again, with the killing of UN troops.


         He further stated that a Nigerian  ministerial  committee  will  be
         visiting South Africa to meet with the Ministries  of  Defence  and
         of Foreign Affairs, as well as the  SANDF  leadership,  to  discuss
         the transformation and integration of the SANDF. He added that  the
         average soldier was not interested  in  coups  and  that  civilians
         needed to understand and accept that they were the  master  of  the
         military,  who  has  to  die  for  causes  created  by   civilians.
         Civilians therefore had a responsibility to ensure that  the  needs
         of the military were met as far as possible.


     F.     Ministry of Foreign Affairs


         The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr S Lamido, explained that peace-
         keeping was not merely a military  activity,  but  included  issues
         like peace, security and stability, that had a  profound  influence
         on the economic activity of a country. As such, the preference  was
         a  non-military  resolution  of  conflict.  He  said  that  Nigeria
         followed  the  following  process  with  regard  to   peace-keeping
         deployments;


         1. The request for peacekeepers went to the department  of  Foreign
              Affairs,  because  the  operation  would  have   international
              economic and political implications.


         2. Recommendations were sent to  other  departments,  e.g.  Finance
              (to  determine  the  financial  viability)  and  Defence   (to
              establish capacity).


         3. The President then approved or rejected.


         4. If approved, the department of Defence do operational planning.


         5. The Department of Foreign Affairs  do  strategic  planning  with
              regard  to  logistical  support  and  co-ordination  of  joint
              operations.


         The ability to quickly withdraw deployment could  mean  success  or
         failure, which meant that the deployment  period  should  be  known
         beforehand. They stated that the period  was  predetermined  in  UN
         operations, but that deployment was not determined  on  a  regional
         basis. It was also important to have the input and support  of  the
         populace, because these  operations  involved  financial,  material
         and human resources. For example, the  operation  in  Liberia  cost
         US$2 million a day.


         There was much tension in West Africa, like in Guinea and  Liberia,
         internal conflict in Sierra  Leone  and  post-election  tension  in
         Cote'D Ivoire, where Nigeria has, or will play, a role.


         This  century  has  been  identified  as  the  century  for   human
         development in Africa. The challenge  was  to  get  NGOs,  regional
         bodies and countries to have this  same  objective,  even  if  they
         differ on how to achieve it.  During  the  Cold  War  (the  control
         mechanism of Africa by the West) African states were  ideologically
         separated, but this has changed with e-commerce and  globalisation.
         They stated that one should question why there  were  conflicts  in
         the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia/Eritrea  and  Sierra
         Leone, so as to get African solutions for these  African  problems.
         It was also clear that weapons of  war  were  coming  from  outside
         Africa. The export of weapons was part of the economy of the  West.
         Africa exported raw goods, but imported  processed  goods  at  high
         prices.


         Africa's debt stood at US$500 billion, but the US had  excesses  of
         US$3 trillion. The challenge was to link Africa  to  globalisation,
         because while democracy raised people's hopes for  prosperity,  the
         resources were locked up in debt.


     G.     Nigerian Customs Service and Excise


         The Deputy Comptroller-General stated that Customs and  Excise  was
         primarily responsible for the movement of goods  over  the  border,
         and as such it collected levies and  excise  and  performed  custom
         control. It also did agency work for other branches of  government.
         For  example,  drug  offenders  were  handed  over  to   the   drug
         enforcement agency, while other offenders were handed over  to  the
         police.  He  said  that  they  had  seized  2 500   cartridges   of
         ammunition the day before  and  that  illegal  arms  needed  to  be
         stopped, because it was used to commit crime.


         Customs  also  perform  joint  operations  with  the  police,   the
         military, drug enforcement agency and the immigrations office.  The
         agency that played a leading role in the operation would cover  all
         expenses and would reimburse the other's expenses. For example,  if
         customs called in the military for support, it should bear its  own
         expenses, as well as those of the military.  This  operation  would
         then be guided by the Customs Act.  Should  the  military  run  the
         operation, it would be guided by the Defence Act.


         They controlled the wide borders of Nigeria by channelling  traffic
         through specific ports or posts. As such, other entry  points  were
         regarded as illegal. Officers  from  the  Auditor-General's  office
         were  deployed,  as  per  the  Constitution,  in   all   government
         ministries  and  parastatals  to  ensure  smooth  running  and   to
         prosecute if necessary.  The  advantage  was  that  these  officers
         gained a better understanding of the area in  which  they  operated
         and could correct issues before they became accounting problems.


         In the  past  Customs  and  Excise  fell  under  the  Home  Affairs
         Ministry, but  because  it  had  more  dealings  with  the  Finance
         Ministry, due to its collection of revenue, levies and  excise,  it
         moved there.


         The leader of the delegation stated that in SA  the  situation  was
         that the police controlled the  border  posts,  while  the  Defence
         Force controlled the borders. Sometimes this led to  conflict,  and
         the  possibility  of  a  gendarmerie  was   being   explored.   The
         gendarmerie was French in origin  and  was  a  combination  of  the
         police and defence force, in character and power.


     H.     Senate Defence Committee


         In  his  opening  remarks,  the  chairperson,  Senator  Dr   Mnamdi
         Eriobuna, MP, stated that in the  defence  committee  members,  put
         their political differences aside and concentrated  on  the  bigger
         issue, i.e. the security of the country. The defence budget at  the
         time stood at 2% of the GDP. They did not  believe  in  downsizing,
         as it created instability and uncertainty in the armed forces.  The
         strength (and happiness) of the armed forces was then  a  guarantee
         for democracy.


         The  leader  of  the  delegation  stated  that  the  South  African
         Parliament was  based  on  the  Westminister  model,  with  certain
         assumptions. These assumptions  were  the  division  of  government
         branches, that Parliament pulled the budget  strings  to  keep  the
         executive in line, and  that  Parliament  had  strong  constituency
         lines for report-backs.


         She stated that the  South  African  defence  committee  could  not
         alter the budget and that an  appropriation  bill  system  will  be
         introduced so that Parliament will have similar powers  as  the  US
         Congress  with  regard  to  the  departmental  budget.  This  would
         increase parliamentary control, but the downside was  that  the  US
         system was too confrontational.


         Parliament had little resources  to  play  an  effective  oversight
         role, which was compounded by the following  facts;  firstly,  that
         Cabinet members were senior party members and, secondly,  committee
         members and the chairperson came from the same  party.  This  could
         result more  in  the  promotion  of  party  cohesion,  rather  than
         members prioritising their  watchdog  roles.  MPs  thus  needed  to
         understand their roles so as to strengthen democracy.


         The defence budget emphasised primary functions, even though a  lot
         of spending took place  on  secondary  tasks.  These  "contingency"
         expenditures were rectified with a supplementary budget, which  was
         introduced by the President. The Senate Committee's view  was  that
         departments spend the  people's  money  and  therefore  the  people
         should state through Parliament how the money should be spend.


         There was no military Ombudsperson (like in South Africa), but  the
         defence committees received many petitions  and  complaints,  which
         it followed up. The committee played no role in the  promotion  and
         placing of senior officers.


     I.     Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON)


         DICON was established in 1964 by an Act  of  Parliament,  with  the
         following mandates:


         1. To  co-operate  and  control  all  factories  that  manufactured
              military items.
         2. To produce equipment for the Nigerian armed forces.


         3. To utilise extra capacity of civilian factories.


         4. To test purchased military items.


         5. To test and inspect substances and  machines  intended  for  the
              armed forces.


         DICON commissioned a  plant  in  1964  with  its  German  technical
         partners. Technical skills were, however, not transferred, and  the
         factory was financially ruined. Gen Obasanjo  signed  a  deal  with
         Belgium to manufacture 14 000  rifles  and  18  million  rounds  of
         ammunition.


         From 1994 to 1998 the defence  industry  was  unable  to  meet  its
         requirements and had to import items. However, the  government  did
         not provide the finances and DICON was unable to pay the  salaries,
         because little production took place.


         DICON was utilising its excess capability to produce furniture  and
         salt, when requested.


         It  ran  a  number  of  factories,  where  the  following  military
         products were manufactured: Rifles, handguns,  handgrenades,  small
         calibre  ammunition  and  blank   ammunition.   Civilian   products
         produced: included head frames for  sinking  wells,  furniture  and
         shotgun cartridges for gaming.


         The Managing Director was Maj-Gen Kyo  Ojomo,  a  serving  military
         official. He reported to a  board,  which  had  to  report  to  the
         Minister of State  for  Defence  (i.e.  Deputy  Defence  Minister).
         Oversight was exercised  by  a  ministerial  committee  (which  was
         chaired by the President or Vice-President) and  the  Parliamentary
         Defence Committees.


         Nigeria was involved in many interventions, but this did not  boost
         the output of the defence industry. DICON was  in  discussion  with
         DENEL (South Africa), which they visited  recently.  They  proposed
         to the Minister of Defence that DICON should also be split  into  a
         procurement/testing agency and a manufacturing agency,  like  South
         Africa's  Armscor  and  DENEL.  This  proposal  was   still   under
         consideration. The relationship between DICON  and  DENEL  improved
         to the point where DICON was  invited  to  defence  exhibitions  by
         DENEL.


     J.     National War College (NWC)


         It was established in 1992 with  the  main  purpose  of  localising
         training of military personnel at all levels in a tri-service  set-
         up. It was the highest professional military  training  institution
         dedicated to the training of senior  military  officers  and  their
         civilian counterparts from other  strategic  state  departments  or
         ministries. The emphasis was on higher level  policy,  command  and
         staff functions in military and civilian appointments  in  national
         and international assignments, as well as the development of  sound
         and consistent military advice, when the use  of  force  was  being
         considered as a policy option.


         The college's motto was "Intellect, Courage  and  Patriotism",  and
         could boast 264 graduates from  Nigeria,  other  African  countries
         and  some  Asian  countries.  The  current  course  8,  which   was
         inaugurated  in  September  1999,  had  60  participants,  50  from
         Nigeria and one each from Tanzania, Namibia, Cote D'Ivoire,  Ghana,
         Benin, Mozambique, Angola, Chad, Senegal and Niger.


         The NWC was headed by a Commandant,  which  was  a  two-star  level
         appointment. The current incumbent  was  Rear-Admiral  G  Shiyandra
         (Navy). He was assisted by a deputy Commandant,  College  Secretary
         (the chief of staff and senior executive officer)  and  a  Provost,
         who was head of the NWC's Centre for Peace  Research  and  Conflict
         Resolution  (CPRCR).  The  CPRCR's  mission  was  to  organise  and
         facilitate research on a national, regional  and  global  basis  in
         the areas of conflict  (the  sources,  monitoring,  prevention  and
         resolution)  and  peace  (the  making,  keeping,  enforcement   and
         building), so as to equip senior  military  officers  and  civilian
         officials to deal with this issue. The Provost  post  was  designed
         for a retired two-star officer, retired ambassador or retired  Vice
         Chancellor.


     K.     Command and Staff College (CSC)


         This college comprised  the  college  headquarters,  a  Faculty  of
         Joint Studies and three Service (Army, Navy, Air Force)  Faculties.
         It was  established  in  1976,  with  the  aim  of  developing  the
         knowledge  of  selected  military  officers.  It  had  an  exchange
         programme with the Ghanese Armed Forces Staff College  and  trained
         2 569  officers   (senior   division),   6 119   officers   (junior
         division), 38 civilians (defence ministry) and 2 778 men  from  the
         services in staff duties.


         The Commandant was Air Vice-Marshall A O Ogundana (Air Force).  The
         selection of students was  done  by  the  different  service  arms.
         There  were  no  failures,  because  students   were   continuously
         assessed and reports were used to  assist  the  service  arms  when
         deploying students after graduation.


     L.     National Defence Academy (NDA)


         The academy was established in  1964  for  the  training  of  young
         officers to be commissioned into the armed forces  of  Nigeria  and
         other countries. The  curriculum  was  academic  and  military.  In
         recognition  of  the   ever-changing   military   technology,   the
         "Nigerian Defence Academy Certificate of  Education"  was  replaced
         in 1985 with a full  degree  programme.  The  curriculum  stretched
         over five years, with the emphasis on the  academic  in  the  first
         four years and on  the  military  in  the  final  year.  The  entry
         requirements were the  same  as  that  of  a  university  with  the
         addition of an entry interview and a military-academic test.


         The attrition rate was 10-20% over a five-year  period.  The  first
         three months  were  the  most  difficult  for  students,  but  once
         passed, most of them did not leave. After pass-out,  the  different
         service arms gave lectures to students on the choices within  these
         arms, e.g.  in  the  Army  they  could  choose  between  artillery,
         infantry, mechanized, etc.  After  graduation,  students  would  be
         commissioned into the Nigerian Armed Forces by the President.


         The  Commandant  was  Maj-Gen  P  G  Sha  (Army).  The   Commandant
         positions of the NWC, NDA and C&SC, like the position of  Chief  of
         Defence Staff (or chief of Armed Force), were rotated  between  the
         three service arms.


     M.     Recommendations


         The Committee recommends -


         1. the  attendance  of  Nigerian  military  institutions  by  South
              African military personnel;


         2. the sharing of knowledge,  especially  on  conflict  management;
              and


         3. the strengthening of economic, political and military ties  with
              Nigeria.
     N.     Conclusion


         The Committee would like to thank our  High  Commissioner  and  his
         staff,  as  well  as  the  Nigerian  Defence  Ministry,  for  their
         assistance and friendship, which assured the success of the visit.

6.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Transport on  Visit  to  Pretoria
     Station, dated 23 May 2001:


     The Portfolio Committee on Transport, having undertaken a  fact-finding
     mission to Pretoria Station and other stations in the area, reports  as
     follows:


     A.     Introduction


         The Committee embarked on the mission to monitor the situation  and
         establish factors that led to the fire at the Pretoria Station.


         In accordance with its oversight function, the  Committee  took  it
         upon itself to meet with stakeholders on the whole  issue  of  rail
         commuters. A multiparty delegation  of  13  members  went  on  this
         trip, which took place on 12 March 2001.


         The delegation consisted of Mr  J  P  Cronin  (Chairperson);  Mr  H
         Fazzie; Mrs B Tinto;  Mrs  S  Mnumzana;  Mrs  D  Ngcengwane;  Mr  T
         Abrahams; Mr G Schneemann; Dr W A  Odendaal;  Mr  S  Farrow;  Ms  H
         Malebana; Mrs T Shilubane; Mr R Ainslie; and Mr M Sibiya.


         In order to examine these important issues, the delegation  visited
         three major stations in the area:


         1. Mabopane Station


         2. Wolmerton Station (Depot)


         3. Pretoria Station


         The members were on board a  third-class  coach  from  Mabopane  to
         Wolmerton  station,  interacting   with   commuters   about   their
         frustrations regarding Metrorail services.


     B.     Mabopane Station


         1. Background


              Mabopane Station is one of the busiest stations in the City of
              Tshwane. It was built as a  modal  integration  station,  with
              buses and taxis  being  feeders  to  the  rail  industry.  The
              station serves approximately 120 000 train/bus/taxi  commuters
              per day and  serves  as  a  link  between  the  Pretoria  CBD,
              Mamelodi and Johannesburg.


              The  management  of  the  station  is   shared   amongst   two
              roleplayers. The Mabopane Transitional Local  Council  manages
              one area, which falls under North West, and Intersite  manages
              the other area, which falls under Gauteng.


              Small businesses on the Gauteng side are  formalised,  whereas
              on the North West side they are not formalised.


         2. Conditions at Mabopane Station


              According to the Mabopane Station Manager, Mr S Lekgari,  most
              customers who are using the station on a daily basis reside in
              the North West Province. He  alluded  to  the  fact  that  the
              station is not customer-friendly, in the sense that there  are
              no facilities for disabled people and no funds to upgrade  the
              station.


              The Committee observed the following:


              (a) Besides the lack of funding, there are also signs of  poor
                  management  on  the  North  West  side  (e.g.  filthiness,
                  electric  cables  lying   around   and   lack   of   basic
                  maintenance).


              (b) At the station, there  are  no  train  timetables  on  the
                  notice  boards,  and  the  communication  system  is   not
                  effectively utilised.


         3. Some concerns raised by commuters


              (a) There is often ineffective communication between commuters
                  and Metrorail.


              (b) Partly due to theft and vandalism, trains are often  late,
                  and thus some commuters lose their jobs because they  then
                  are also late.


              (c) Metrorail often does not announce when, and  give  reasons
                  as to why, trains are going to be delayed.


              (d) The announcement speakers at the station are often out  of
                  order.


              (e) When asked about  a  commuter  forum,  they  had  no  idea
                  whether such a forum existed.


              (f) The environment at the station is not hygienic.


              (g) Commuternet - the station radio is not  utilised  to  make
                  announcements. Instead, it plays music all the time.


              (h) Metrorail cancels trains and takes them off  the  schedule
                  without informing commuters. As a result, trains  that  do
                  run  are  very  full,  which  leads  to  commuters   being
                  stranded and exposed to danger - the  reckless  ones  hang
                  on doors and between coaches.


              (i) Commuters are not safe on trains - they  are  harassed  by
                  thugs and gangs.


              (j) Security personnel are of no help either. Indeed, they are
                  harassing commuters.


              (k) Metrorail keeps on increasing the  number  of  first-class
                  coaches, which are always empty. More third-class  coaches
                  are in demand, because the majority of commuters use it.


              (l)  Security   personnel   re-sell   tickets   to   incorrect
                  destinations to  desperate  commuters.  This  causes  more
                  confusion and frustration.


              (m) Trains are a health hazard, as they are not cleaned.


              (n) Commuters state that they have very little options but  to
                  use the train, as it is the  cheapest  mode,  compared  to
                  buses and taxis.


              (o) Commuters noted that there is  no  train  service  between
                  Mabopane and Rustenburg. They  felt  that  a  bus  service
                  should be provided, to avoid paying more transport fares.


              While  the  Committee  could  not,  in  the  time   available,
              establish the veracity of all these concerns, delays and  lack
              of effective communication were concerns  raised  consistently
              by virtually all commuters they spoke to.


     C.     Wolmerton Station Depot


         Wolmerton Station Depot is a repair workshop  dealing  with  short-
         term repairs and maintenance.


         Mr Tinor Gabric, the Wolmerton  Station  Depot  Manager,  indicated
         that vandalism on coaches is caused by commuter frustration due  to
         train delays. This is also a criminal and an economic activity.


         He took  members  around  the  depot  and  showed  them  vandalised
         trains. He mentioned that this is  a  problem  that  happens  on  a
         daily basis, at the same time explaining that it is  expensive  and
         time-consuming to replace sliding  doors,  windows  and  seats.  He
         stated that criminals who are  involved  in  this,  are  after  the
         aluminium, which is very expensive and fetches a  good  price  with
         scrap dealers.


         Mr Gabric indicated that the tendency of commuters to stand on  the
         connecting sector not only endanger their  lives,  but  it  damages
         cables, which in turn results in train delays.


         He mentioned that vandalism often occurs whilst  the  train  is  in
         motion, and Metrorail/SARCC do not  have  the  capacity  to  employ
         enough security  officers.  He  indicated  that  vandalism  impacts
         negatively on the availability of trains  and  also  affects  their
         maintenance budget.


         He also stated that a programme aimed  at  improving  the  material
         used for doors and windows is under  way.  Although  expensive,  it
         will reduce the rate of vandalism.


         Mr Honey Mateya, the  Metrorail  Chief  Executive  Officer,  stated
         that there are commuter  forums  -  SANCO  was  involved  when  the
         forums were established. Metrorail is not  participating  in  these
         forums, as they are fully  commuter-driven.  Metrorail  assists  in
         publicising forum meetings by providing flyers to commuters and  by
         making announcements to radio stations.


         Metrorail/SARCC   admitted   that   there   are    problems    with
         communication with  commuters.  There  is  a  centralised  intercom
         system, but it  is  not  good  enough.  Mr  Mateya  indicated  that
         Metrorail, together with SARCC, is  working  hard  to  improve  the
         conditions on trains to make them more commuter-friendly.


          Mr Chris Kilowan, Acting Regional  Manager  (Pretoria)  Metrorail,
         mentioned that there is a shortage of train drivers, and this  also
         contributes to the insufficient service they provide to  commuters.
         At present, the challenge is that it takes 18 months to  two  years
         to  train  drivers,  and  the  examination  test  is  quite  tough.
         However, they hope to overcome the backlog within two years.


         There is also a constant problem of drivers on sick  leave  because
         of stress-related illnesses. This is as a  result  of  many  people
         committing suicide by throwing  themselves  in  front  of  oncoming
         trains.
         Another cause of driver shortage is the  regulations  and  lack  of
         planning of Metrorail. He also  mentioned  that  a  plan  of  using
         dedicated cellphones is under way to avoid  train  accidents,  like
         the one in Tembisa.


     D.     Pretoria Station


         Some delegates inspected the damaged part of the Pretoria  Station.
         Mr Prentice, Intersite Managing Director, mentioned  that  it  will
         cost R30 million to renovate the station. It is envisaged  that  by
         June all renovations will be complete.


         Mr Prentice went on to say that an investigation is under  way  and
         that the Committee will get a preliminary  indication  as  to  what
         really caused the fire. He mentioned that  Pretoria  Station  is  a
         very busy terminus.


         On the day of  the  incident,  trains  were  delayed  for  over  40
         minutes due to fibre-optic cable malfunction. The same  malfunction
         affected the station's public address system, so there was  no  way
         of communicating to commuters what was causing  the  train  delays.
         Eventually some 1 700 commuters gathered on the platform.


         In reply to questions from the delegation, it was conceded that  no
         alternative means of communication  were  contemplated,  much  less
         used.


         A section of the crowd started vandalising  shops  in  the  station
         complex, during which the fire was started.


         The Committee does not condone the act  of  vandalism,  but  it  is
         probable  that  poor   communication   and   commuter   frustration
         contributed to the fire.


     E.     South African Rail Commuter Corporation
         Mr J P van Niekerk, Executive Manager: Finance, SARCC, briefed  the
         Committee on government funding of  commuter  rail.  He  noted  the
         deepening crisis in the sector: The average age  of  rolling  stock
         is now 24 years, and the signalling system  is  very  old.  Current
         subsidy commitments are well below  what  is  required  to  sustain
         commuter rail, let alone expand services.


         Mr Van Niekerk estimated  that  at  current  levels  of  investment
         there will be no commuter rail  left  in  South  Africa  within  15
         years.


         He explained that the SARCC explored loan mechanisms, but that  the
         Treasury  is  very  sensitive  about  departments   or   government
         agencies trying to obtain loans independently.


     F.     Follow-up and recommendations


         The Committee feels that this was a very brief  visit,  although  a
         lot came out of it. There is a need to  have  follow-up  visits  to
         interact with commuters and management.


         Many of the problems in the commuter rail  system  relate  directly
         to inadequate funding over 20 years. However, while addressing  the
         funding challenge, there are also immediate  changes  that  can  be
         carried forward.


         The Committee comments and recommends as follows:


         1.  In  the   light   of   insufficient   funding   and   lack   of
              recapitalisation, the Department of Transport must develop  an
              effective funding strategy for commuter  rail  to  ensure  the
              maintenance of existing services, and to  make  expanded  rail
              commuter services possible.


         2. Metrorail must pay more  attention  to  effective  communication
              with passengers, both at stations and on trains.


         3. All  stakeholders  develop  programmes  to  foster  a  sense  of
              ownership among rail commuters so that the public takes a more
              active part in preventing vandalism and crime.


         4. Consideration must be given (perhaps in  co-operation  with  the
              SAPS) to the development  of  a  dedicated  and  trained  rail
              commuter security and safety division.


         5. The lack of affordable  integration  between  buses  and  trains
              must be addressed.


         6. All stakeholders should look at ways of improving conditions  at
              stations.


         7.  There  is  a  need  to  develop  active,   dynamic   and   more
              representative commuter forums which can assist with educating
              commuters about safeguarding coaches and safety on trains.


         8. Interaction is needed between the Department of  Transport,  the
              Department of Public Enterprises and the Department of  Safety
              and Security on safeguarding the interests of stakeholders.


         9. New and refurbished stations of a better  quality  will  benefit
              commuters.


         10.     The station and train security  personnel  require  special
              training, and there should be uniform  security  training  for
              public transport.


     G.     Acknowledgements


         The Committee wishes to thank the SARCC, Metrorail,  Intersite  and
         the SAPS for making this trip possible and fruitful.

     Western  Cape  Regional  Office,  Beitbridge  Border  Post  at  Messina
     (Northern Province), Skilpadshek Border Post and Mafikeng (North West),
     dated 6 June 2001:

     Conclusion   D


     Recommendations   E


     A.     Introduction


         The Committee resolved to visit the Department of Home  Affairs  in
         the Western Cape, Northern Province and North West. The aim of  the
         visits was to gain first-hand knowledge of -


         *  problems that are being experienced by  the  Department  in  the
              various provinces,


         *  problems that face border posts in the various provinces, and


         *  to find solutions to these problems.


         In all the provinces, we gave special attention to ports of  entry,
         as we are establishing a new migration policy for our country.  The
         information that we gather about ports of entry, will  help  us  to
         formulate a practical and workable immigration policy.


         The Committee therefore thanks the National Assembly  for  granting
         us permission to undertake the study tour.


         The delegation, under the leadership  of  Mr  D  A  Mokoena  (ANC),
         included Mr W M Skhosana, Mr  K W Morwamoche (ANC), Ms M  M  Maunye
         (ANC), Bishop L J Tolo  (ANC),  Mr  F  Beukman  (New  NP)  and  the
         Committee Secretary, Mr J Vermeulen.


     B.     Approach


         Information was obtained by interviewing departmental officials  in
         the provinces visited. We also requested the officials  to  provide
         us with written reports. The guideline  for  the  reports  is  that
         they should list  all  the  problems  that  are  being  experienced
         together with suggested solutions.


     C.     Findings


         1. Western Cape


              On Tuesday, 27 March 2001,  we  met  with  Mrs  M  B  Mgxashe:
              Regional Director for the Western  Cape,  and  various  senior
              officials, who briefed the Committee. The meeting  took  place
              at the Regional Office, 56 Barrack Street, Cape Town.


              (a) Overview by Mrs M B Mgxashe: Regional Director


                  The  Western  Cape  is  still  operating  on   the   staff
                  structure  of  1  October  1995  and  is   thus   severely
                  understaffed.   Because   of   the   understaffing,    the
                  Department struggles to render basic services.


                  In the province, there are many cases of:


                  * fraudulent marriages,
                  * fraudulent late registrations of birth, and
                  * foreigners with illegal identity documents (IDs).


              (b) Immigrants Selection Board


                  The Board's resources are too little  and  its  budget  is
                  insufficient. It needs more human resources to  enable  it
                  to follow up and investigate the  applications  of  people
                  who apply for permanent residence.


                  Many foreigners abuse the system by fraudulently  entering
                  into marriages of convenience or by fraudulently  claiming
                  that they are in a  same-sex  relationship  with  a  South
                  African citizen. The sole purpose of the fraud is  to  get
                  South Africa residency.


                  When the Regional Immigrants Selection  Board  rejects  an
                  application  for  South  African   residence,   applicants
                  appeal to the Central  Committee,  which,  in  turn,  then
                  approves the application  as  they  are  scared  of  legal
                  battles. It is very difficult to prove that a marriage  or
                  relationship  is  fraudulent,  especially  as  there   are
                  limited human resources to investigate cases. This is  why
                  the Central Committee is scared of legal battles.


                  The Board should be autonomous and function as a  separate
                  entity under the Department (like in the USA and Sweden).


              (c) Permanent Residence Applications


                  More than 100 people apply  for  permanent  residence  per
                  month, and  29%  of  all  immigration/permanent  residence
                  applications for the entire country are submitted in  Cape
                  Town.


                  The Board finalises only 60 applications per month, as  it
                  cannot get rid of the backlog due to human  and  financial
                  resource problems.


                  When  the  Board  rejects  an  application  for  permanent
                  residence, it provides  reasons  for  doing  so,  and  the
                  applicant  may  appeal  to  the   Central   Committee   in
                  Pretoria.


              (d) Refugee Affairs


                  This section struggles with staff shortages  and  lack  of
                  resources.


                  From 200  to  400  applications  for  refugee  status  are
                  submitted per month.


                  The refugees mainly originate from  Angola,  Somalia,  the
                  Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia.


                  Officials said that it was frustrating to work with  high-
                  profile people  from  other  African  states,  as  certain
                  promises may have been made to  them  that  the  officials
                  may not be aware of. These high-profile people then  often
                  get upset when they must follow standard procedures.


              (e) Immigration Services


                  There are only 11  immigration  officers  in  the  Western
                  Cape. It is therefore nearly  impossible  to  enforce  the
                  Aliens  Control  Act.  The  Western  Cape  has  a  serious
                  problem  with  the  Chinese   and   Russian   Mafia,   who
                  contravene the Aliens  Control  Act.  Many  Nigerians  are
                  also exploiting the Refugees Act, as there are not  enough
                  personnel to trace people who break the law.


                  The  lack  of  human  resources  is   a   major   problem,
                  especially at Cape Town International Airport.  The  first
                  image that foreigners get of South Africa, is  a  negative
                  one, as they often have to stand in  long  queues  at  the
                  airport upon arrival here.


                  Foreigners exploit the late registration  of  births  with
                  the  help  of  South  Africans  as  a  means  of   getting
                  citizenship.


                  A computer facility to directly  liaise  with  the  police
                  about false documents is needed.


                  To deport foreign nationals who  contravene  the  law,  is
                  very expensive, and deportations form a large part of  the
                  budget of Immigration Services.


         2. Northern Province


              On Monday, 2 April 2001, at  Beitbridge  border  post  in  the
              Northern Province, we  met  with  Mr  M  V  Mabunda:  Regional
              Director, various senior officials, staff members of the South
              African Revenue  Service  (SARS),  the  South  African  Police
              Service (SAPS) and the Beitbridge Border Clearing Agency.  The
              SARS personnel, the Immigration Officers, the SAPS members and
              the clearing agent, who were interviewed, work  at  Beitbridge
              Border Post.


              After the meeting we walked around on the bridge and spoke  to
              pedestrians who crossed the bridge.


              (a) Overview by Mr M V Mabunda: Regional Director


                  The province requested a budget of  R49  million  for  the
                  year, but only  received  R42  million.  The  province  is
                  divided into four regions.


                  Home Affairs in the province  has  150  vacancies  in  its
                  staff structure.


                  In some areas of the  province,  departmental  staff  must
                  use office space in magistrates' offices, as there  is  no
                  other  available  office  space.   In   Naboomspruit   the
                  magistrate    gave     the     Department     insufficient
                  accommodation.


                  The head office undertook to computerise at least  20%  of
                  the   offices   and    service    points    that    needed
                  computerisation during this financial year.


                  Home Affairs in the province intends to  make  a  proposal
                  to the head office  that  they  should  consider  allowing
                  them to introduce a system  of  fining  illegals  who  are
                  caught selling goods.


                  There is a need for a  Refugee  Reception  Centre  in  the
                  province.


                  A total of 18 officials of the Department  was  questioned
                  during February 2001 on suspicion of illegal activity.
              (b) Beitbridge border post


                  The Northern Province is a  very  big  area,  with  eights
                  ports of entry.


                  Beitbridge is the largest port of entry in  South  Africa,
                  and it links South Africa and Zimbabwe. A total of 42  000
                  transit visas  were  issued  for  Zimbabwean  citizens  in
                  1999, and about twice that in  2000.  There  are  actually
                  two bridges that stretches over  the  Limpopo  River,  one
                  for pedestrians and one for vehicles.


                  Three types of people use the border post:


                  * Pedestrians.
                  * Tourists.
                  * Vehicles that transport goods.


                  The process followed at SARS when  a  vehicle  crosses  to
                  Zimbabwe:


                  *    Fill in  registration  certificate  DA65.  All  items
                       that are taken over  the  border  and  that  will  be
                       brought back to SA, must be registered on this form.


                  *    Before a gate pass is issued, SARS runs  a  check  to
                       see if vehicle is not stolen.


                  *    After clearance is received, proceed  to  Immigration
                       Services.


                  A lot of fraud occurs at the  border  post.  South  Africa
                  has  an  incentive  scheme  for  people  to  export  South
                  African-made goods. This is exploited  by  people  in  the
                  following manner:
                  *    A truckload of South African goods is  taken  through
                       the border post to create  the  impression  that  the
                       goods are destined to be sold outside our border. The
                       goods are then brought back to SA at  a  later  stage
                       through another border post or  by  other  fraudulent
                       means, and are then sold in SA. Apart from the profit
                       that is made by selling the goods, a  VAT  refund  is
                       claimed for exporting SA goods.


                  *    A bill of goods is processed without any  goods  ever
                       leaving the country. This scheme works on  the  basis
                       that one dishonest person in Customs and  Excise  and
                       one dishonest person  in  Immigration  is  needed  to
                       clear a bill of  goods  that  never  really  existed.
                       After the fraud has  taken  place,  it  is  virtually
                       impossible  to  prove  that  such  goods  never  went
                       through the border post.


                  Another form of  fraud  occurs  when  people  without  the
                  proper documentation bribe either  immigration  officials,
                  SAPS  members  or  SANDF  members  to  enter  the  country
                  illegally.


                  Mr Mabunda said that three people are dismissed from  duty
                  per month in the province for fraud.  He  also  said  that
                  poor management at  the  border  post  is  a  contributing
                  factor to the fraud.


                  Officials indicated that Chinese and Pakistani people  are
                  crossing the Limpopo River  at  night.  They  are  ferried
                  across the river by syndicates.
                  When people enter SA without the proper documentation,  it
                  does  not  take  them  long  to  obtain  documentation  by
                  fraudulent means.


                  Superintendent Uys  from  the  SAPS  said  that  the  main
                  problems at the border post were:


                  *    Corruption, and
                  *    Lack of effective procedures.


                  He also said that it  is  difficult  to  detect  organised
                  crime, because it is so well organised. Only  two  corrupt
                  officials are needed to bypass the  whole  system  at  the
                  border post. As a possible  solution,  he  suggested  that
                  some forms  of  human  control  should  be  replaced  with
                  technological forms of control. There is not even data  to
                  show  how  many  people  enter  and   leave   SA   through
                  Beitbridge.
                  Mr Hartman, head of Immigration at Beitbridge,  said  that
                  fraud and  corruption  could  not  be  controlled  at  the
                  border post. He  contributed  his  sentiments  to  various
                  factors:


                  *    Lack of security at the gate.  There  are  more  than
                       200 holes in the security  fence  around  the  border
                       post. No money was made available by  the  Department
                       of Public Works to repair the fence.


                  *    Lack of technology.


                  *     Lack  of   co-operation   from   Chief   Immigration
                       Officers.


                  *    The SANDF only comes on duty at 22:00 every night.


                  *    Work is done according to shifts, and there  are  not
                       enough   staff   members   to   cover   every   shift
                       efficiently. There are eight to ten staff members per
                       shift, and they process 3000 to 5000 people per day.


                  There is  a  joint  Zimbabwe/RSA  liaison  committee  that
                  meets every month. Zimbabwe is very  co-operative  on  the
                  issue  of  illegal  entry  of  their   citizens   to   SA.
                  Zimbabweans who are repatriated, are fined  50  Zimbabwean
                  dollars for leaving their country illegally.


              (c) Regional Representatives


                  *    Ms Molapo: Pietersburg Regional Representative


                       The  deficit  of  last  year's  budget  is  R900 000.
                       Decentralised offices are  ill-equipped  due  to  the
                       insufficient budget  for  the  region.  There  is  no
                       sufficient accommodation for Home  Affairs  staff  in
                       some offices, and the accommodation  at  some  border
                       posts are appalling.


                       In other government departments,  staff  members  are
                       subsidised with cell phones, vehicles,  etc,  but  no
                       cell phone subsidies are given to Home Affairs staff.
                       When they travel, they have no form of  communication
                       and they have to travel often and for long distances,
                       as the province is big and rural.


                       Staff needs to be  equipped  with  managerial  skills
                       through training.


                       Many people leave the Department, and this causes the
                       standard of service to drop.


                  *    Ms Khubutlo, Giyani Regional Representative


                       There are six district offices in  the  region,  with
                       100 staff members. The staff is not enough to provide
                       a professional service in the region. The  budget  of
                       R8 million is  also  not  sufficient.  There  is  not
                       enough money to buy photo-copiers, and  they  do  not
                       even have  subsidised  vehicles  to  drive  to  rural
                       offices.


                       There is a lack of training at managerial level.


                       The policy on migration is  reactive,  and  needs  to
                       become proactive.


                  *    Ms Seguale, Leboagomo Regional Representative


                       There are seven service points in the region that are
                       not computerised, therefore no  certificates  can  be
                       issued at these service points.


                       There are  no  subsidised  vehicles  to  reach  rural
                       offices.


                       The 11 immigration officers in the region are to  few
                       to be effective.


                       The frequent changes in immigration regulations  that
                       are received from head office, cause confusion.


         3. North West


              On Tuesday, 3 April 2001, at the Mbabatho Tusk in Mbabatho  in
              North West,  we  met  with  Ms  I  Mantlasi,  Acting  Regional
              Director,  Mr  T  I  Emang,  Acting  Regional  Representative,
              Mbabatho, Mr M Ishmael, Acting Chief Immigration Services,  Mr
              Mosenthal,  Acting  Control  Immigration  Officer,  Mr   M   L
              Ferreira, Acting District  Representative:  Vryburg,  Mr  M  T
              Mocwaledi, District Representative: Kganyasi, Mr D  P  Maseng,
              Chief Immigration Officer: Mafikeng Airport,  and  Mr  Lebete,
              Chief Immigration Officer: Ramathlabama border post.


              After the meeting, we went to Skilpadshek border post  and  to
              the  regional  Home  Affairs  offices,  where  we   spoke   to
              officials.


              (a) Ms I Mantlasi, Acting Regional Director


                  Home Affairs in the province established a  task  team  to
                  deal with corruption.


                  The budget for the province is  R39  million,  but  it  is
                  insufficient; it cannot  even  buy  furniture,  computers,
                  etc. The repatriation of illegals is very  expensive,  and
                  their food and medical  treatment  too.  This  burdens  an
                  already insufficient  budget.  Although  the  province  is
                  rural, with offices and  border  posts  far  removed  from
                  each other, there is no subsidised transport, cell  phones
                  or  travelling   and   subsistence   allowances.   Private
                  security companies who  look  after  buildings,  are  also
                  expensive.


                  There are 29 Home Affairs  offices  in  the  province,  of
                  which 10 are border posts.


                  There are few women in management positions.


                  There is a plan to establish a further 24  service  points
                  in the province.


              (b) Bray border post


                  This border post is beside the  Molopo  river,  and  links
                  Botswana  and  South  Africa.  There  are  no  toilets  or
                  running water. There is also no shade for people to  stand
                  in, nor space inside the building for the public.


                  150 people use the border  post  every  day;  it  is  open
                  between 08:00 and 16:00. No goods go through  this  border
                  post,  as  it   is   not   a   commercial   border   post.
                  Ramathlabama, Kopfontein and  Skilpadshek  are  commercial
                  border posts.


                  Home Affairs staff have to use the  SAPS's  telephone  and
                  fax facilities, as they do not have their own.


                  ID applications and the registration of  births  are  also
                  done here.


              (c) Mokopong border post


                  Home Affairs personnel share the building with  the  SAPS,
                  and there is a lack of office space.


                  40 to 50 people use the border post per day.


                  Other Home Affairs functions  are  also  provided  at  the
                  border post, like  ID  applications  and  registration  of
                  births.


                  Home Affairs officials  rely  on  the  SAPS  to  do  their
                  banking, as they have no transport.


              (d) Makgobistad border post


                  This post links South Africa and Botswana.


                  The borderline runs through  the  same  tribal  area.  The
                  fence  thus   divides   the   Barolong   tribe   in   two.
                  Negotiations with the Chief of the tribe are essential  in
                  order to deal with people jumping the fence.


                  There is no proper accommodation for officials.


                  This is a problematic border post,  as  many  people  jump
                  the fence, despite the fact that  the  Department  ran  an
                  education  campaign  in  the  area  to  teach  people  the
                  importance  of  using  the  border  post.  Children   from
                  Botswana jump the fence and attend school in SA.


              (e) Ramathlabama border post


                  The  electricity  regularly  cuts  out,  and  this  causes
                  computer data to be lost and damaged. There is no  back-up
                  system for the computers, and  technicians  have  to  come
                  from head office to assist. The  computers  are  also  not
                  linked to the main-frame in Pretoria.


              (f) Skilpadshek border post


                  The office is very small and ill-equipped.  There  are  no
                  telephones, and officials have to beg the SAPS  when  they
                  need to phone. There are also no proper toilets.


     D.     Conclusion


         The provinces that were visited, struggle with the following:


         1.  Lack  of  human  resources.  This  is   especially   true   for
              immigration services. Foreigners get a bad impression of South
              Africa when they are subjected to long queues at airports. The
              immigration staff structure is totally incapable of  enforcing
              the  law.  Fraudulent  marriages   and   fraudulent   same-sex
              relationships  are  difficult  to  trace.  It  is  even   more
              difficult to investigate, due to insufficient human resources.
              The immigration budget is depleted by the cost of repatriating
              illegals.


         2.  Insufficient  budget,  lack  of  computers,  furniture,  office
              space, subsidised  cars,  cell  phones,  and  subsistence  and
              travel allowances.


         3. Corruption at border posts.  Immigration  officials  are  easily
              bribed, as their salaries are low and the system  followed  at
              border posts is insufficient to stop organised crime. There is
              a lack of efficient management in the Immigration  Section  at
              Beitbridge.


         4. People jump the fence at border posts due  to  lack  of  control
              and personnel. Border posts are also ill-equipped. We saw many
              holes in the fence at Beitbridge, and we were  told  that  the
              holes have been there for a long time, despite many  pleas  to
              the Department of Public Works to fix them.


         The information that we gathered during this study  tour,  will  be
         invaluable when we finalise the  new  immigration  legislation  for
         our country  in  the  future.  Our  experiences  also  help  us  to
         understand the practical problems that frustrate the Department  in
         their day-to-day operations.


     E.     Recommendations


         Emanating from our experience gained during  the  study  tours,  we
         intend to do  the  following,  in  order  to  further  enhance  the
         Committee's work:


         1. Conduct  interviews  on  migration  issues  and  border  control
              measures, etc, in specific provinces, with a view  to  monitor
              violations.


         2. Undertake study  visits  to  SADC  countries  to  ascertain  the
              status of migration and refugee policies.


         3. Interact with SADC countries on a new  framework  for  migration
              control.


         4. Interact with the  Public  Service  Commission  on  the  current
              staffing and training needs of the Department.


         5. Undertake further surprise visits to Home  Affairs  offices  and
              ports of entry.
