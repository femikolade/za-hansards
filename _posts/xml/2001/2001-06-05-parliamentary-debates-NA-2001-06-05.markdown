                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms G L MAHLANGU: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that South Africa and the rest of the world is today
       celebrating World Environment Day and that this day was established
       by the United Nations in 1972, to remind people across the globe
       about the importance of conserving the environment;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  every year a theme is identified to focus world attention on a
           particular development issue and that this year's theme is
           ``Connect to the World Wide Web of Life''; and


       (b)  the intention of this theme is to link humanity's development
           and ultimate survival with the delicate balance of the natural
           world, and to serve as a reminder that the earth is our common
           heritage and that the bounty of nature is one and indivisible;


  (3) commends the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism and the
       provincial environmental affairs departments for their launch of a
       wide range of sustainable environmental initiatives aimed at giving
       effect to the environmental rights expressed in the Constitution;


  (4) calls on all organs of state to give full effect to our citizens'
       environmental rights by adherence to the principles contained in
       Chapter 1 of the National Environmental Management Act, 1998 (Act No
       107 of 1998), not only on this day, but in all their policies, plans,
       programmes and projects throughout the year;


  (5) commits itself to uphold all the principles of the international
       conventions for the protection of the environment to which South
       Africa is a signatory ...

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr A J BOTHA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses alarm at the increasing acts of arson at Mangete in KwaZulu-
       Natal in support of land claims;
  (2) recognises that this defiance of authority is leading to a state of
       anarchy;


  (3) acknowledges that repeated calls over several years by the community
       of Mangete to the authorities, including the Office of the President,
       have gone unheeded;


  (4) censures the Minister of Safety and Security for this state of
       affairs, which has already encouraged land invasions elsewhere, most
       recently in Krugersdorp in Gauteng; and


  (5) calls upon the Minister to prioritise the identification and
       apprehension of the culprits involved, so that they can be prosecuted
       and sentenced in the interest of the rule of law.

[Applause.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the UN-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
       (IPCC) has found that global warming is occurring and has been
       substantiated by scientific research findings;


  (2) further notes that the IPCC found that greenhouse gas emissions from
       industrial operations are a major contributing factor to global
       warming;


  (3) recalls that the 1997 Kyoto Protocol binds signatories to reducing
       greenhouse gas emissions from 2008; and


  (4) calls on the countries with the highest levels of greenhouse gas
       emissions, most notably the United States, members of the European
       Union, Russia and China, to implement the emissions reduction
       requirements of the Kyoto Protocol without delay.

[Applause.]

Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:

       brutal attacks and murder;

       and clothing the nation;

       be eradicated;

       Ceres, Mr and Mrs Dennis of King William's Town and Mr and Mrs
       Schoonwinkel of Groblersdal;


  (5) endorses the call of the ANC mayor of Ceres that local government,
       the SAPS, farmers and farmworkers develop plans for the safety of
       farming communities; and
  (6) extends its sincere condolences to the bereaved in these and all
       other farm attacks.

[Applause.]

Mnr J J DOWRY: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die volgende
sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem van -


       (a)  die voortgesette plaasaanvalle in die Boland wat die lewe van
           die egpaar Visser geëis het, en dat dit die tiende plaasmoord in
           die Boland sedert April verlede jaar was;


       (b)  die plaasmoorde in Mpumalanga en die Oos-Kaap wat die lewe van
           nog twee egpare geëis het, en dat daar vanjaar reeds 31
           plaasaanvalle meer as in 2000 was; en


       (c)  dat elke plaasmoord talle werkersgesinne werkloos laat;
  (2) verder kennis neem dat Japie Grobler, president van AgriSA, gesê het
       dat dit duidelik is dat wraak, en nie misdaad nie, die rede vir die
       plaasaanvalle is; en


  (3) ook kennis neem dat die DA alle vorme van geweld en moord in Suid-
       Afrika veroordeel; en


  (4) 'n beroep op die Regering doen om -


       (a)  sy steun toe te staan aan boere en plaaswerkers wat saam die
           sinlose plaasaanvalle wil beëindig; en


       (b)  maatreëls in werking te stel om plaasaanvalle te voorkom.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J J DOWRY: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -
       (a)  the continued farm attacks in the Boland which have claimed the
           lives of the Visser couple, and the fact that this is the tenth
           farm murder in the Boland since April last year;


       (b)  the farm murders in Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape which have
           claimed the lives of two more couples, and the fact that this
           year there have already been 31 more farm attacks than in 2000;
           and


       (c)  that each farm murder leaves many farmworkers' families
           unemployed;


  (2) further notes that Japie Grobler, President of AgriSA, has said that
       it is evident that revenge, and not crime, is the reason for the farm
       attacks;


  (3) also notes that the DA condemns all forms of violence and murder in
       South Africa; and


  (4) appeals to the Government to -


       (a)  give its support to farmers and farmworkers who jointly want to
           end the senseless farm attacks; and


       (b)  implement measures to prevent the occurrence of farm attacks.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) calls on Government to urgently address the management of the ailing
       road system in South Africa;


  (2) expresses its condolences to the bereaved families of the 12 people
       who died on Monday in a collision between a truck and a minibus taxi;


  (3) calls on the Government to urgently institute programmes that are
       devised to co-ordinate traffic, health and environmental concerns,
       thus resulting in less traffic congestion, minimising the frequency
       of collisions and decreasing pollution; and


  (4) calls on the Minister of Transport to institute a prohibition on the
       movement of trucks, tractors and other heavy, slow-moving vehicles in
       all metropolitan areas between 06h30 and 08h30 on weekday mornings.

Mr N N KEKANA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the ruling by the Constitutional Court on Tuesday, 29 May 2001,
           affirms the constitutional responsibility of Government to
           provide shelter to the poor;


       (b)  the 200 displaced Alexandra flood victims, and many other
           homeless people throughout the country, will greatly benefit
           from this ruling;


       (c)  the Department of Housing is already doing a sterling job of
           providing housing to our people; and


       (d)  the Minister of Social Development is turning empty buildings

       closely with Government in the progressive realisation of adequate
       housing for all South Africans; and

       rebuilding the township.

[Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) recognises that -


       (a)  the economic and political cancer of President Robert Mugabe's
           regime in Zimbabwe undermines the entire region; and


       (b)  this regime has ignored rulings by the Supreme Court and forced
           the chief justice to resign, closed radio stations, bombed the
           only independent daily newspaper, arrested leading opposition
           figures, brutalised and killed opponents, including thousands of
           Matabeles, assaulted lawyers, human rights activists and
           democratic reformers, invaded factories, universities and farms,
           rebuffed Secretary-General Koi Annan of the United Nations, the
           president of Nigeria and the British and American governments;


  (2) acknowledges that as a result South Africa has seen its own currency
       depreciated, its economic growth compromised and its race relations
       endangered;


  (3) notes that nearly a million immigrants have walked into South Africa
       from Zimbabwe, an exodus that critically impacts on South Africa's
       economic future;


  (4) further notes that Hitler Hunzvi died in Zimbabwe yesterday and that
       Mugabe has been invited to address a land invasion rally in
       Mpumalanga by the labour tenants committee ...

[Time expired.]

Dr C P MULDER: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die volgende
sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) sy skok uitspreek oor die drie dubbele moorde wat op plase in
       onderskeidelik die King William's Town-, Ceres- en Groblersdal-
       distrikte plaasgevind het in die bestek van drie dae;


  (2) die beplande verset-aksies deur boere en hulle werkers wat
       voortspruit uit hierdie wreedaardige moorde, heelhartig ondersteun;
  (3) kennis neem daarvan dat hierdie sinnelose moorde besig is om daarin
       te slaag om die boerderybedryf, wat nie net aan duisende mense werk
       gee nie, maar ook kos voorsien aan miljoene mense, te destabiliseer;


  (4) die Adjunkminister vir Landbou en Grondsake, mnr Dirk du Toit, daarop
       wil wys dat hierdie moorde nie net gewone misdaad is, soos hy die
       afgelope week beweer het nie, waar dat getuienis aandui dat dit 'n
       berekende poging is om boere van hulle grond af te dryf; en


  (5) daarom 'n beroep doen op mnr Du Toit om nie boere onregverdig te
       kritiseer vir hulle reaksie op hierdie moorde nie, maar dat hy eerder
       sy tyd en aandag daaraan sal bestee om die Regering te oortuig om
       onmiddellik 'n daadwerklike plan op te stel om 'n einde te bring aan
       hierdie vlaag van plaasmoorde en -aanvalle.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its shock at the three double murders which took place on
       farms within the space of three days in the districts of King
       William's Town, Ceres and Groblersdal, respectively;


  (2) wholeheartedly supports the planned protest action by farmers and
       their workers arising from these cruel murders;


  (3) notes that these senseless murders are beginning to succeed in
       destabilising the farming industry, which not only provides work to
       thousands of people, but also supplies food to millions of people;


  (4) wishes to point out to the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Mr Dirk du
       Toit, that these murders are not just ordinary crimes, as he
       maintained last week, but that evidence indicates that they represent
       a calculated attempt to drive farmers off their land; and


  (5) therefore appeals to Mr Du Toit not to criticise the farmers unfairly
       for their reaction to these murders, but rather to devote his time
       and energy to convincing the Government immediately to put in place a
       decisive plan to bring an end to this wave of farm murders and
       attacks.]

Mrs T J TSHIVHASE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Advocate Dikgang Moseneke has rejoined the legal
       fraternity as an acting Judge in the Pretoria High Court;


  (2) welcomes his decision; and


  (3) wishes him good luck in his new position.

[Applause.]

Mr S B FARROW: Chairman, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the taxi in which 12 people died in Gauteng on Monday had
       been found to be unroadworthy and unlicensed;


  (2) recognises that this vehicle should not have been on the road;


  (3) expresses its shock at these unnecessary deaths and extends its
       sympathy to the families of the deceased; and


  (4) calls on the transport and traffic authorities to take the scourge of
       unroadworthy minibus taxis seriously and to -


       (a)  stop merely issuing traffic tickets, which are never followed
           up;


       (b)  impound unroadworthy taxis and arrest the owners and unlicensed
           drivers of such vehicles; and


       (c)  speed up the taxi recapitalisation project in the interest of
           saving lives.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Chair, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  an independent survey into medical schemes revealed that -


           (i)   in 1999, most were operating with less than 13% of cash
                    reserves; and


           (ii)  most schemes are operating on increased contribution and
                    decreased benefits;


       (b)  fewer young and healthy people are opting for medical cover;


       (c)  a more recent survey reveals that companies are reducing their
           percentage contribution to medical schemes; and


       (d)  the Medical Schemes Act (Act 131 of 1998) is having the opposite
           of its intended effect; and


  (2) calls on the Ministers of Health and of Finance to -


       (a)  facilitate more up-to-date research on the status of medical
           schemes and the impact of the Medical Schemes Act; and


       (b)  review health funding policy in South Africa, looking to
           countries such as Taiwan and Israel, where government subsidises
           medical schemes but requires all citizens to have health
           insurance of their choice, and Belgium where the state provides
           a minimum package but requires every employed person to acquire
           health insurance of their choice.
Dr J BENJAMIN: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Fikelela Children's Centre for HIV-positive children in
           Mandela Park, Khayelitsha, was opened yesterday; and


       (b)  that the children's centre was a brainchild of the Yabonga
           Children's Project in Africa which was started in Germany three
           years ago, and of women in Khayelitsha;


  (2) commends all the stakeholders involved in making child care
       facilities available for children living with HIV/Aids; and


  (3) calls on business and communities to work together in establishing
       these child care facilities.

[Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die volgende
sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis, aangesien jeugdagvierings nasiebou moet bevorder -


  (1) die inhoud van 'n omsendbrief deur die Vrystaatse LUR vir Onderwys
       ten sterkste veroordeel, aangesien dit aan haatspraak en rassisme
       grens;


  (2) die Minister van Onderwys versoek om die betrokke LUR te dissiplineer
       omdat hy afgedwing het dat genoemde brief hardop tydens
       saalplegtighede voorgelees word; en


  (3) alle skole versoek om Jeugdag op so 'n wyse te vier dat dit
       versoening sal bevorder en rasse-polarisasie sal teenwerk.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FF:
  That the House, since Youth Day celebrations     should promote nation-
  building -


  (1) condemns most strongly the content of a circular by the Free State
       MEC for Education, as it borders on hate speech and racism;


  (2) requests the Minister of Education to discipline the MEC in question
       for insisting that the aforementioned letter be read aloud during
       school assemblies; and


  (3) requests all schools to celebrate Youth Day in such a way as to
       promote reconciliation and counteract racial polarisation.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its concern that one of the SAPS's biggest successes,
       Operation Neptune, was suspended because funds have dried up;
  (2) notes that the Marine and Coastal Management Services' need for
       assistance and the suspension of the operation is a serious
       regression by the Government with regard to the protection of marine
       and coastal resources;


  (3) expresses its disgust that the Government is incompetent in
       identifying real budgetary concerns and dealing with them; and


  (4) calls upon the Minister of Safety and Security and the Minister of
       Environmental Affairs and Tourism to urgently set aside funds so that
       Operation Neptune may continue.

                            WORLD ENVIRONMENT DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that today is World Environment Day; and
  (2) urges all South Africans to take this day seriously by recognising
       that the environment encompasses the world in which we live, which
       needs to be protected, promoted and cared for.

Agreed to.

                      BIRTHDAY OF THE PROPHET MOHAMMED

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that according to the Islamic calendar today is the birthday of
       the Prophet Mohammed, who was born on Monday, 12 Rabi-ul-Awwal, or 20
       April 571 AD;


  (2) also notes that Muslims across the world will be commemorating his
       birth until the end of the lunar month by participating in a variety
       of intimate community events at mosques; and
  (3) wishes all Muslims, both inside and outside our country, a blessed
       Moulood-un-Nabi.

Agreed to.

                               POINT OF ORDER

                                  (Ruling)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, just before we come to
the Orders for today, I wish to rule on a point of order which was raised
in this House some time last week.

During the Provincial and Local Government Vote debate, on Thursday, 31 May
2001, the hon Mr M J Ellis raised a point of order on a remark made by the
hon B M Solo, in reference to the hon member Mrs G M Borman.

I undertook to study the Hansard and to rule on the matter at a subsequent
sitting of the House. Having had the opportunity to study the relevant
Hansard, I wish to rule as follows: The contested remark is contained in
the following sentence ``She is so obsessed with the notion: `What can one
expect from a black person?'.

Even though Mr Solo refrains from directly calling Mrs Borman a racist, he
does infer that she holds racist views, which is tantamount to calling her
a racist. In view of a ruling by the Speaker, that it is never
parliamentary to call another member a racist, regardless of the context, I
call on the hon member Mr Solo to withdraw his remarks.

Mnu B M SOLO: Sihlalo, ngendlela ebekwe ngayo le ndaba lapha eNdlini,
iyezwakala. Njengesizwe esimpisholo, sizimisele ukulwa nobandlululo ngazo
zonke izindlela, ikakhulukazi ngokwebala, njengalokho umgomo wenhlangano
usiyalela. [Ubuwelewele.] [Uhleko.] (Translation of Zulu paragraph
follows.)

[Mr B M SOLO: Chairperson, the way this issue has been discussed, is
understood. As a black nation, we are prepared to fight apartheid with all
means, especially racism as the policy of our organisation stipulates.
[Interjections.] [Laughter.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Solo, could you withdraw the
words? I have heard your statement. You concur with what I say, but could
you withdraw?

Mr B M SOLO: Sihlalo, ngiyahoxisa. [Chairperson, I withdraw.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Ngiyabonga kakhulu. [Uhleko.] [Ihlombe.]
[Thank you very much. [Laughter.] [Applause.]]

                ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER
                         REVENUE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move:


  That the House, subject to the concurrence of the National Council of
  Provinces, establishes a joint committee in terms of Joint Rule 111 to
  consider the Revenue Laws Amendment Bill, 2001.

Agreed to.
                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 19 - Correctional Services:

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chairperson, can I just be indulged
and request that I remove the overcoat? [Interjections.] No, I wanted to do
that because I wanted to surprise the House, because I am still nice even
if I take it off. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: You look like Jackie Selebi.

The MINISTER: Mr Chairperson, our theme this year will be corrections in
partnership with the community for prison reform.

Never in the history of the department, certainly not since I became the
Minister of Correctional Services, have we, as a department, been faced
with such tremendous opportunities and challenges to set the department on
a radically new course, building on what is good and jettisoning what is
bad for our new democracy. There has been tremendous willingness from all
sectors of society to co-operate and collaborate with the department, in
support of our vision of delivering excellent Correctional Services in
partnership with the community. It is our strong belief that Correctional
Services must be a collective social responsibility.

The Department of Correctional Services is the custodian of people who
offended the community and transgressed the laws of the state, as we all
know. It represents a conglomeration of people with diverse backgrounds and
cultures. It is a community with its own culture. Most importantly, it is
carrying the responsibility of correcting behaviour which society has
failed to deal with so far. An obligation is therefore placed on the
department, the Government and society at large to shift the focus and the
emphasis from incarceration to the enhancement of rehabilitation.

Let me just quickly run through the budget allocated to the department to
carry out its mandate. Although the budget is not sufficient to provide for
all the needs of the department, it is pleasing to see an increase of about
8,8% from the previous budget. Therefore, we are saying that the total
budget, for instance, allocated for the years 2000-2001 was R5,6 billion,
and for 2001-2002 it is R6,1 billion, which is that increase of 8,8%.

This budget allocation is intended to fund the operation of about 238
prisons countrywide, which are made up as follows: eight prisons for female
prisoners only, 13 youth correctional facilities, 114 prisons for male
prisoners only, 99 prisons accommodating both male and female prisoners,
and four prisons that are temporarily closed down for renovations. All
these prisons accommodate 170 959 prisoners, of whom 56 422 are unsentenced
and 114 537 are sentenced prisoners.

At this juncture, I also wish to take the opportunity to indicate some of
the programmes that the department will embark upon in the current MTEF
period. I will also indicate to the House later the successes that have
been achieved by the department in the previous financial year. However, a
full account of the achievements will be provided in an annual report that
will be issued later this year.

As regards enhancing rehabilitation, in terms of the priority programmes
presented by the crime and justice cluster to the Cabinet Lekgotla held on
22-23 January 2001, the Department of Correctional Services committed
itself to stepping up its campaign to put rehabilitation at the centre of
all its activities by identifying the enhancement of rehabilitation
programmes as a key departmental objective for this current financial year,
and the forthcoming MTEF period.

This is a result of a re-examination of the department's strategic role in
the fight against crime within the broader context of the criminal justice
system. The critical role played by the Department of Correctional Services
in crime prevention is the reduction of recidivism through the provision of
effective rehabilitation services to offenders.

Despite the human rights culture brought about by the new democratic
dispensation in our country, the immediate post 1994 transformation of the
department focused its attention mainly on safe custody. However, the more
recent integrated justice system approach towards crime prevention
persuaded the department to re-examine its core objectives and reprioritise
its resources.

The focus is now on transforming our prisons from being so-called
universities of crime or criminal headquarters into effective
rehabilitation centres that produce skilled and reformed individuals who
are capable of successful re-integration into their communities as law-
abiding citizens. The department has, therefore, identified the enhancement
of rehabilitation programmes as a key fundamental starting point in
contributing towards a crime-free society. The development phase of the
enhancement process will take place during this current financial year, and
the implementation phase will take place in the course of the forthcoming
MTEF period.

This enhancement process will be realised through the implementation of,
amongst others, the following strategies within the allocated budget of
about R453,22 million: the development of individualised need-based
rehabilitation programmes; marketing rehabilitation programmes to increase
offender participation; the establishment of formal partnerships with the
community to strengthen the rehabilitation programmes and to create a
common understanding; promoting a restorative approach to justice to create
a platform for dialogue for the victim, the offender and the community to
facilitate the healing process; combating illiteracy in prisons by
providing adult basic education and training to offenders; increasing
production to enhance self-sufficiency and to contribute to the Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Strategy; and, lastly, increasing training
facilities for the development of skills. These strategies will be
translated into the following themes: education, training, reskilling,
personal development, spiritual enlightenment and preparation for release.

Turning to prisoner accommodation, the recently held departmental strategic
planning session for the forthcoming MTEF period managed to identify a
number of opportunities which will help to provide solutions to a number of
problem areas. The main challenge facing the Department of Correctional
Services is the development of sustainable strategies to cope with the ever-
increasing prison population, which puts tremendous pressure on our limited
financial resources.

One thing I have learnt in the more than two years I have served as
Minister of Correctional Services, is that there are no quick fixes to the
problem of overcrowding. Despite the interventions between September and
October 2000, which led to a reduction in prison population, from 172 271
during April 2000 to 160 807 by the end of October 2000, the prison
population stood at 170 959 on 31 March 2001. It is obvious that, however
important, these interventions did not have a long-term effect on the
prison population.

The strategic planning session has therefore served to strengthen our
resolve to continue in search of durable, sustainable and long-term
solutions to the problem of overcrowding. The department will continue to
pursue prison population reduction strategies to combat overcrowding, with
our partners in the integrated justice system.

In this regard, and flowing from the strategic planning session, we have
unequivocally made the necessary link between the effective utilisation of
the community corrections system and the implementation of viable reduction
strategies. We have, therefore, identified the enhancement of the community
corrections system as a key departmental objective to address overcrowding
by diverting low-risk awaiting-trial prisoners to community corrections,
and employing the following strategies to improve the quality and
effectiveness of that system: The improvement of the quality of visitations
to probationers and parolees by correctional officials; the involvement of
the family of the offender in the visitation and rehabilitation process;
bringing community corrections reporting offices closer to communities by
increasing the number of community corrections satellite offices and sub-
offices; and the implementation of electronic monitoring to ensure
continuous around the clock monitoring of probationers, parolees and
awaiting-trial prisoners.

Furthermore, the department is engaged in the following projects to
alleviate overcrowding: In November 2000 we opened the Qalakabusha Prison
in Empangeni, with an accommodation capacity of 1 392 beds. Ebongweni
Maximum Prison in Kokstad, with a capacity of 1 440 beds, should be open
sometime in July. The Devon Pre-release Centre in Springs, with a capacity
of 600 beds, is on schedule. The APOPS prison, Mangaung Maximum Prison, in
Bloemfontein, with an accommodation capacity of 2 928 beds is also in an
advanced stage of completion, and is due for occupation on 1 July this
year, which is three months ahead of schedule.
This project was undertaken by a black empowerment consortium called
Bloemfontein Correctional Contracts. The contractual obligations for the
employment of previously disadvantaged individuals have been exceeded
during the construction phase of this prison. Up to about 1 500 people have
been trained and deployed during construction, and some 60% of the managers
and supervisors are PDIs. Around 90% of the frontline staff are also PDIs.

The construction of Kutama-Senthumule Maximum Security Prison, the APOPS
prison in Louis Trichardt, with an accommodation capacity of 3 024 beds, is
going according to schedule and its occupation is expected in February
2002. This project is being undertaken by another black empowernment
consortium called South African Custodial Services.

At this stage, 33 prisons have been identified for repair and maintenance
work, and an amount of about R214,55 million will be spent this year. These
prisons have been divided into three priority groups, each in various
stages of progress.

We now turn to the implementation of a unit management system. The
strategic planning session identified unit management as the missing
ingredient in the transformation of our prison system. Thus, we have set
ourselves a target to implement unit management in 80% of our prisons by
the end of the forthcoming MTEF period, that is, 31 March 2005.

Unit management is an approach that makes provision for: firstly, the
division of the prison into smaller manageable units; secondly, improved
interaction between staff and prisoners; thirdly, improved and effective
supervision; fourthly, increased participation in all programmes by
prisoners; fifthly, enhanced teamwork and a holistic approach; and lastly,
the creation of mechanisms to address gangsterism.

In a recently televised BBC documentary on gangs in Pollsmoor Prison
entitled, Cage of Dreams, a gang member boasted that it is not the warders
who are in control of the prison, but the ``numbers'' gangs. This was
confirmed by a correctional official who has expressed his fear of being
stabbed by gang members, stating that nearly half of his colleagues at the
maximum security section had been stabbed at least once. Another official
stated that correctional officials were natural targets of gangs and that
they are underpaid and outnumbered by 100 to 1 by the numbers gangs. Some
of the people that I am talking about, those who face that type of
difficulty and atrocity daily, are here.

It is useful to note that over a 40-year history, since its inception
internationally, unit management has demonstrated its effectiveness as a
strategy to reduce prison violence and control gang activity while
contributing to achieving prisoner rehabilitation. The implementation of
unit management will result in improved service delivery and will lay a
solid foundation for the enhancement of rehabilitation. The lessons that we
have learned in our implementation of this concept have taught us that the
future prison facilities must be designed and prototyped in such a way that
they are capable of meeting the department's needs over their projected
life spans.

This reminds me of Sir Winston Churchill who once said that we design our
buildings to meet our needs and then find that the buildings that we have
designed define our needs. New facilities must be designed completely along
unit management lines. At the same time we fully recognise the high cost we
have been paying for recent prison projects. In response to this concern,
we have undertaken a major effort in conjunction with the National Treasury
and aided by a US government grant, to develop low-cost solutions to prison
facility construction.

The vision of the department, as outlined above, necessitates the
development of an effective human resource strategy that will address at
least the following aspects: firstly, the multiskilling of correctional
officials through needs-directed training to support the implementation of
unit management and enhancement of rehabilitation strategies; secondly,
promoting correctional services as a profession and a career of choice;
improving the working conditions and remuneration of frontline staff; and
lastly, transforming our work ethic to enhance service delivery.

Let me take this opportunity to report to this House the highlights and
major activities of our department in this past financial year. A series of
workshops involving community organisations and rehabilitated former
offenders, were held between September 2000 and March 2001, to develop a
common understanding of the concept of rehabilitation and to define the
role and responsibilities of stakeholders. The workshops assisted in
identifying policy gaps, and also initiated the development and
intervention model for assessing rehabilitation needs.

On 31 March 2001 the department launched a historic partnership in
Mpumalanga in which Nkosi Mthethwa donated a piece of land for crop
production by the department and the community of Piet Retief. [Applause.]
This project, called the Amakhaya Farm Project, is intended to facilitate
the re-integration of prisoners into the community.

The St Albans production workshop is part of an initiative to increase the
department's capacity to enrol more prisoners into its rehabilitation
programmes. We have opened a new production workshop at St Albans Prison,
situated in Port Elizabeth. The St Albans production workshop will be
utilised to manufacture woodworks, steelworks and textiles. A feasibility
study is also currently underway to evaluate the possibility of erecting a
shoe production factory on site. They gave me shoes yesterday but they did
not fit well, so I am still using my old ones. [Laughter.] The prisoners
earmarked for training in the St Albans production workshop will be taken
from all the provinces to ensure that the new training facilities benefit
the entire country.
Just to indicate some statistics of the income generated by the department,
I wish to state that, out of the total revenue of R72,4 million during the
2000 financial year, R2 million was generated from the sale of products
manufactured by prisoners. All this money goes into the State Revenue Fund.
I think they have also tried to display some of the products out there.
[Applause.]

In respect of the President's Award Youth Development Programme, the
patrons of the President's Award Programme, His Royal Highness the Duke of
Edinburgh and former President Mr Nelson Mandela, awarded the President's
Gold Award to 47 young offenders who excelled in the youth development
programme, that is, at one of the prisons here in the Western Cape.

Then, regarding the national symposium, the department hosted a national
symposium on Correctional Services on 1 and 2 August 2000, attended by
approximately 160 participants representing approximately 70 stakeholder
organisations, which recognised the need to promote a collective social
responsibility for the rehabilitation and re-integration of offenders into
the community and recommended the establishment of a partnership forum for
Correctional Services.

As regards of the Howard University-South Africa partnership, the
department co-hosted an international conference in July 2000 with the
Medical Research Council and Howard University of the USA on HIV/Aids,
crime, substance abuse and violence as consequences of poverty. The
conference was opened by Deputy President Jacob Zuma and attended by policy-
makers, academics, professionals, researchers and scientists from South
Africa and the USA. I remember Prof Asmal was down with a cold that week,
as we tried to get hold of him.

As a result of this conference, the following projects were conceived: the
Ahanang youth project with the SA National Council on Alcoholism and Drug
Dependence, intended to focus on the reduction of substance abuse by youth
in prisons; and a post-apartheid study into health issues in prisons with
the Medical Research Council and Emory University, USA, intended to
research health services, including that for HIV, in South African prisons.

Going on to HIV/Aids and health issues in prisons, the department's
HIV/Aids policy strategy has been reviewed, amended and circulated to all
relevant stakeholders. The purpose of its review was to make provision for
the inclusion of the following latest HIV-prevention strategies: the
promotion of safe sexual practices; the prevention of mother-to-child
transmission; the management and control of STDs and the distribution of
condoms; access to voluntary counselling and testing; and treatment, care
and support.

Since the appointment of the new inspecting judge for the Judicial
Inspectorate of Prisons there has been considerable progress in giving
effect to the provisions of the Correctional Services Act, 1998, relating
to the establishment of an independent office to inspect and report on the
conditions in prisons and the treatment of prisoners.

Following a strong campaign by the newly appointed inspecting judge,
Justice Fagan, we released 8 451 low-risk awaiting-trial prisoners that
were granted bail of R1 000 or less, but were unable to afford it. We also
made a significant reduction in numbers by bringing forward the release
date of parolees by a maximum period of nine months, achieving a total
reduction of 17 000. This was indeed a significant achievement, considering
that this figure is almost twice the accommodation capacity of all the
recent prison construction projects put together.

The Judicial Inspectorate has also made good progress regarding the
appointment of independent prison visitors in terms of section 92 of the
Correctional Services Act, 1998. It is envisaged that independent prison
visitors will be appointed in all provinces before the end of this
financial year.

In the process of drafting subordinate legislation and implementing certain
aspects of the Correctional Services Act, 1998, which is the principal Act,
it became apparent, based on practical considerations, that certain
amendments would be necessary in order to fully implement the principal
Act, as well as to be more compliant with the provisions of the
Constitution. Central to the amending Bill are the following: The treatment
of prisoners; accommodation of disabled offenders and gender
considerations; disciplinary procedures for prisoners; a new parole system;
the treatment of child offenders; and, lastly, the use of firearms and non-
lethal incapacitating devices. The NCOP's Select Committee on Security and
Constitutional Affairs approved the amending Bill with minor amendments.

With regard to employment equity, we in Correctional Services continued to
make strides in addressing the imbalances of the past, by promoting
affirmative action to create an equitable workplace without compromising
service delivery, and substantially increasing the number of women and
persons with disabilities in our staff component.

Ms N E HANGANA: Where are these women?

The MINISTER: Following the developments in corrections and democratic
changes after the promulgation of the Correctional Services Act, our White
Paper of 1994 formulated a holistic policy formulation process to review
existing policies with a view to identifying policy options that
incorporate international best practices and provide the greatest value for
public money spent.

To the hon Hangana I wish to say that this is not the yardstick. I could
bring more women to the House than this Government could afford. This is
not really the yardstick.

Ms N E HANGANA: We would like to see these women.

The MINISTER: The member will see these women.

Both the National Council on Correctional Services and the Portfolio
Committee on Correctional Services support this policy formulation.

In 2000 the department managed to decrease the number of prison escapes by
46%. The number of prisoners who escaped from custody in 2000 is 250,
compared to 459 who escaped from custody in 1999. In order to fully
appreciate the extent of this improvement, it is important to make a
comparison between escape rates of the past five years, as well as the
increase in the prison population. In 1996 the number of escapes was 1 244
and the prison population was 118 731, and in 2000 only 250 escaped with a
prison population of 160 063.

With regard to corruption, in terms of the priority programmes presented by
the crime prevention and justice cluster to the Cabinet Lekgotla held on 22
and 23 January 2000, the Department of Correctional Services committed
itself to step up the fight against crime and corruption in South African
prisons.

In this regard, I have tasked the National Council on Correctional Services
to conduct a thorough research, based on international best practice, and
advise the Ministry, taking into account the unique circumstances of the
South African correctional system, on the best model for an independent
anticorruption unit to investigate corruption and crime in our prisons.

In conclusion, I can, without fear of contradiction, assure this House that
the Department of Correctional Services is ready to assume its rightful
place in the criminal justice system and make a real contribution to the
fight against crime in our country. It will do everything in its power to
strengthen its partnership with all stakeholders, state departments,
business, NGOs, parastatals, CBOs, and employee organisations in grappling
with the challenges of change.
I wish to thank the management and all staff of Correctional Services for
their dedication to toil daily, under difficult conditions - I must
emphasise that - bearing in mind that appreciation of our circumstances has
become a rare commodity with the public.

My appreciation also goes to the various nonstate actors who have willingly
involved themselves in assisting us to fulfil our mandate and mission. It
is a historic fact of life that as long as crime is the persistent badge of
human activity, prison facilities and prisoners will remain an eternal
reality. It is, therefore, this kind of co-operation with the sectors of
our society that will enable us to carry this burden with reasonable ease.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the National Council on
Correctional Services for the work they have done under the leadership of
the hon Judge Kumleben, whom I wish to thank in absentia for his role in
setting up the council and congratulate for a job well done. In January
this year, I appointed the hon Judge Desai as the chairperson of the
council, and he too should be commended, I must say, for the striking
features of leadership he has shown so far, and I also wish him well in
this new challenge.

I wish to express my sincere gratitude to the Portfolio Committee on
Correctional Services for their support, and to congratulate the new
chairperson, the hon member Ben Fihla, on his recent appointment.
[Applause.]

Let me also take this opportunity to present, I must say with approval, a
carving of the Coat of Arms as a donation to the Speaker, which she has
accepted, manufactured by prisoners as part of our rehabilitation
programmes. Where is it? [Applause.] Well, she said she will decide where
to hang it.

With these words, I would like to thank all the hon members. May God bless
them, South Africa and Correctional Services. [Applause.]

Mr N B FIHLA: Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon members and comrades,
rehabilitation, reformation and reintegration - the 3Rs of contemporary
prison reform - are the stated objectives of the South African prison
system that has dictated imprisonment policy.
The rehabilitation strategy, in particular, has suffered a number of
serious attacks in recent years. The most serious attack followed the
discouraging observation of repeat offenders. This also accounts for the
rising prisoner population, which dominates spending trends in the
Correctional Services budget. This growth in spending on development of
offenders has often been a limiting factor. However, the importance of
rehabilitation has been noted and this has meant that the development of
the offenders programme has since been increased by an average of 14% a
year from 1997/98 to 2000/01.

Arguably, prisoner rehabilitation appears to have had a major impact on
contemporary thinking about imprisonment policies. It is for this reason
alone that within the arena of prisoner rehabilitation there is still room
for improvement. Any crime control policy, however, involves a trade-off
between the crime control effectiveness and the social cost associated with
implementing it.

One must also be concerned about other aspects of the costs associated with
imprisonment. These costs include the costs of building, maintaining and
managing prisons, which include the food, warders, rehabilitation
programmes, correctional management, welfare costs associated with
supporting prisoners' families, the loss of economic capacity resulting
from the removal of workers from the labour force and the results of
removal and the dehumanising effects of imprisonment on the prisoners,
warders and prison officials as well as on society at large.

One may view the increase in the prison population from 109 756 sentenced
prisoners in the year 2000 to a total of 170 168 sentenced prisoners as at
28 February 2001 as one of these conflicting costs associated with crime
control effectiveness. Necessary solutions to the problem of overcrowding
in prisons have resulted. Five new facilities will be built in the next
three years, of which two will be constructed by private-public
partnerships.

In terms of the Asset Procurement and Operating Partnership System or
APOPS, prisons are constructed and operated by private companies. A total
of 5 988 additional places will be created through the two pilot APOPS
projects. The capital costs of the remaining three new prisons will amount
to approximately R1,5 billion over three years. These additional facilities
will increase prison accommodation by about 14,5% by March 2004, making
more use of noncustodial alternatives and limiting incarceration in
internal institutions to those convicted of more serious crimes.

Within this arena, community correction has seen a significant budget
overhaul. Figures projected on spending on community correction have
increased dramatically from R95,1 million in 1997/98 to R246,4 million for
2001. It is estimated that it will be approximately R334 million in
2003/04.

A major initiative within the Department of Correctional Services has been
in connection with the future implementation of electronic monitoring.
Although the programme of electronic monitoring has been beset by some
initial teething problems, it looks set to be a promising and productive
programme. The department aims to be able to monitor 8 850 probationers and
parolees by March 2004.

The primary aim of electronic monitoring is to supervise probationers,
parolees and awaiting-trial persons subject to community correction. It
also aims to increase the efficiency of the system by ensuring compliance
with home confinement where that is ordered by the court. The department
foresees the advantage of such a programme in reducing the average costs of
supervising parolees and probationers.

The accommodation of youths and disabled prisoners has been placed under
review. At present, there are a total of 66 216 sentenced and unsentenced
youths in our prisons. This is unacceptable. The more positive aspect of
dealing with juveniles will be clearing the prison of juveniles and handing
them over into the care of the Department of Welfare and Population
Development.

Mother-and-child units were established in five provinces during the past
two years and it has been put forward that such units will also be
established in prisons in the remaining provinces over the medium term.
With all these aspects and proposals focused as possible means of easing
prison overcrowding, the department intends to manage the prison population
down to 150 000 over the next three years.

In addressing the prevention of the spread of the HIV in prisons, we have
seen a rush to develop and implement preventive measures. Much attention
has centred on such controversial issues as compulsory or voluntary blood
testing, isolation versus integration of HIV-infected inmates into the
prison mainstream, provision of condoms and effective educational measures
for specific groups within the prison.

What has been missing from much of the debate has been an in-depth analysis
of the perceptions and positions of the two main groups affected by Aids in
prison, that is, prisoners and prison officials. These perceptions rather
than an imposition of conceptual frameworks from outside provide a critical
basis when formulating guidelines and strategies for the effective
implementation of Aids prevention measures and Aids educational programmes
in prison. It is encouraging to note that the department is reviewing an
HIV/Aids management strategy for both members and prisoners in order to
direct policy and strategy development within the prison environment.

According to a 1977 documents of the United States' Bureau of Prisons, unit
management is defined as a small self-contained inmate living and staff
office area which operates semi-autonomously within the confines of the
larger institution. The South African Department of Correctional Services,
which lists unit management as one of its policy developments, sees the
prison divided into smaller, more manageable units to allow for more
individual attention through a carefully considered individual case plan.
This new policy aims to provide expert support in the rehabilitation
process.

The Department of Correctional Services has been the subject of a Public
Service Commission investigation into management practices. Corruption
among departmental staff emerged as one of the irregularities. This is
indeed regrettable. Numerous proposals have been put forward by the
commission and it is heartening to note that remedial steps have already
been taken to redress these irregularities.

The establishment of a strategic management team by President Mbeki to
address the findings is at an advanced stage. The Department of
Correctional Services has already undertaken certain correctional actions,
such as the establishment of a good governance unit which will conduct
inspections and audits, as well as run anticorruption programmes.
A commendable initiative by the Department of Correctional Services and the
Centre for Conflict Resolution has seen the institution of a prison
transformation project. The primary goal of this project is to contribute
to the transformation of prisons from a militaristic organisational culture
to a culture of growth and development where human rights are respected and
people are treated with dignity, and to equip and empower management,
warders and prisoners to manage conflict more effectively.

One of the successes of this project during the 1999-2000 period has been a
series of workshops on conflict resolution for awaiting-trial prisoners
while in prison. Also, communities, gangs, staff, prison management and
inmates held strategic planning meetings on the restoration, empowerment
and reintegration of inmates and a series of conflict resolution workshops
were held with trial gang members at Pollsmoor Prison.

The prison transformation project closely adheres to the Department of
Correctional Services' restorative justice programme which will be adopted
in the rehabilitation of offenders in order to facilitate the mediation and
healing process between offenders, victims, families and communities.

In conclusion, South Africa faces a daunting challenge. On the one hand we
must continue to expand the economy to improve the standard of living and
the infrastructure; on the other hand, we must update societal institutions
such as the criminal justice system. Hard decisions lie ahead.

To begin with, improvement in policing must be implemented, and courts,
community programmes and prisons must be both physically and
organisationally improved. In the area of correction, a decentralised
approach is suggested that draws upon the expertise and entrepreneurial
spirit of all organisational members.

Clearly this is work in progress and more work needs to be done. The
question remains: Why are people punished for their wrongs? The philosopher
Hegel concluded that people are punished to acknowledge them as human
beings. By punishing people, pain is inflicted for a wrong deed in much the
same way that good behaviour is rewarded. If people are not punished, their
rights as individuals to be treated as humans are not accepted.
The ANC supports the Vote. [Applause.]

Mr H A SMIT: Chairperson, the DA will vote in favour of the adoption of
this Vote, although we do have certain reservations. The hon the Minister,
as well as the previous speaker, referred to the programmes on South
African television, as well as on the BBC, on the excellent work that has
been done, and is still being done, by the Centre for Conflict Resolution
of the University of Cape Town. I want to compliment them, and I also want
to welcome in the public gallery here today, the person who is heading that
programme, Joanna Thomas. I think she deserves a compliment on this.
[Applause.]

I think we are all committed to the primary goal of protecting communities
against the recurrence of crime through an effective and affordable
correctional services system. The prison service should be overhauled so
that criminals can be kept behind bars. A lack of cells may never be an
excuse for not catching and locking up criminals in this country.

The Department of Correctional Services is facing a crisis characterised by
- and I only want to name a few factors -firstly, severe prison
overcrowding; secondly, serious breaches of security; thirdly, escapes of
prisoners; fourthly, too many awaiting-trial prisoners; fifthly, a lack of
discipline and corruption, and I want to say, specifically by some
personnel; sixthly, low morale on the part of some of our personnel; and
seventhly, the rapid transmission of HIV/Aids in prisons. We all know the
figures that were mentioned in the report by Judge Fagan. The last factor
concerns juveniles in prison.

The alarming increase in the crime rate in South Africa has resulted in a
huge influx of convicted criminals and awaiting- trial prisoners into our
prison facilities. I am not going to dwell on figures; these have already
been mentioned by previous speakers. But the community at large must be
protected by the state against recurring crime.

To achieve this, the DA says the following: Ensure that prison terms are
served for the periods intended by the sentencing judicial officers;
secondly, constantly monitor the parole system to secure strict control;
thirdly, maintain a healthy balance between punishment and rehabilitation
with the emphasis on rehabilitation; fourthly, empower a professional,
motivated and loyal staff component to provide quality service.

HIV-negative prisoners and staff members must be protected against
infection by HIV-positive prisoners. It must be ensured that adequate
correctional service facilities are built and maintained. There must be
continuous liaison with the Departments of Justice, of Safety and Security
and of Social Development in order to effectively reduce the number of
awaiting-trial prisoners. The Minister also referred to that aspect. There
must be effective antidrug programmes.

Prisoners should be taught the ethics of honest, hard work, and should,
through the intervention of the Department of Correctional Services, be
committed, where possible, to an intensive skills programme. This will have
the added benefit of producing, upon their release, productive members of
our society. I think the Minister will agree.

Four of the most crucial areas of concern relate to - and I am not going to
dwell on them - again firstly, overcrowding, secondly, breaches of security
and escape, thirdly, the high number of awaiting-trial prisoners and,
fourthly, the morale of our Correctional Services personnel.

The Minister should note that the DA proposes building more prisons by
speeding up privatisation of new prisons, although I do not believe this to
be the final solution. I want to compliment the Minister on his latest
initiatives in this regard, that is, immediate measures to tighten prison
security and that of prisoners in transit, expediting trials of unsentenced
prisoners and rewarding outstanding services by our personnel - personal
merit should serve as the only criterion for promotion - the
intensification of the process of correctional supervision and also, as
mentioned by the Minister, the electronic monitoring system.

Lastly, I also want to compliment the Minister on his uniform here today
and call on him to bring back discipline in our department. Government
officials and prisoners must be subjected to a much stricter code of
conduct, and any deviation from it should be dealt with in a swift and
appropriate manner. We say no prisoner should be eligible for early release
or parole of any kind who is not drugfree, able to read and trained in a
skill which will land him or her a job outside. We say ``bad crime equals
bad time''. We also say ``a hard time for armed crime''.

Lastly, there are other aspects, like the nonfilling of the post of the
National Commissioner, that I would have highlighted, but because of a lack
of time I am not going to do that. However, I think our Minister is doing
an excellent job under difficult circumstances. I also thank the personnel
who are still rendering an outstanding service. [Applause.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Mr Chairperson, Minister Skosana, colleagues, ladies and
gentlemen, it is time once again to look to the budget allocation for the
Department of Correctional Services, and in doing so reflect on the
progress of the department in previous years and those improvements that
have been realised in the past seven years specifically.

Whilst we are looking at an increase of 8,8% over last year's budget, we in
the IFP are concerned that the budget allocation is far from adequate to
deal with the issues that face the Department of Correctional Services.
Looking at the statistics released recently, reflecting prisoners in
custody as at 28 February 2001, it is commendable that the Minister and his
department officials have been able to function at all on the previous
year's budget allocation, given the pressures and circumstances imposed on
this department through no fault of their own.

This is the ``cinderella'' department within the justice delivery system.
It is the end of the line in a system that I believe is still fraught with
problems, problems that place greater demands on the Department of
Correctional Services every year.

The prison population continues to be on the increase year by year. It
currently stands at almost 170 000 people, as we heard, and still a large
portion of the inmates - 58 000 to be exact, or in excess of one third of
the prison population - are awaiting-trial prisoners. They are there
because of delays in court processes. This continues to create major
problems for the department, and the IFP calls on the Minister of Justice
urgently to address the backlog in his department that is a cause of
serious overcrowding in the system.

There is also still an urgent need to readdress sentencing options,
especially for minor crimes. This would ease the prison population by
approximately 12 000 prisoners. Courts should be imposing more community
service under supervision, and of course, once implemented, the new
electronic monitoring system as opposed to imprisonment.

There are currently very few prisons that do not exceed their capacity and
a vast number that accommodate almost double the capacity. We are concerned
that not only does this pose a serious security and health problem for the
department, it creates major difficulties in implementing discipline,
providing education, training and rehabilitation programmes and assisting
prisoners with reintegration back into their communities.

I attended the first National Symposium on Correctional Services we heard
about earlier last year, and this concentrated to some extent on the
overcrowding problems. Certain recommendations emanated from that symposium
and have subsequently been introduced. One such measure was the release of
some 8 000 awaiting-trial prisoners accused of less serious offences that
were granted bail of R1 000 or less. This symposium was a great success and
I sincerely hope that it will be repeated in the future.

The Minister and his department really listened to the portfolio committee
during last year's budget debate and implemented or at least attempted to
implement many programmes that cater for the concerns that were raised by
members during that debate. We are encouraged to see an improvement in the
production and agricultural targets, although they still fall far short of
what I would like to see, because it is still my contention that it is
through such programmes that we can best achieve rehabilitation and
reintegration into our communities.

I believe that far more emphasis still needs to be placed on developing
more industrial workshops and farms through the department, and that they
can supply their own equipment to produce and at the same time provide
opportunities for individuals to develop work skills and keep themselves
busy. We have heard from the Minister about the sort of income that is
realised from such projects. It is a fact that these prisoners who are
actively engaged in any work or ongoing educational activity are far more
positive in their outlook and create much less of a threat to society
because they develop self-respect.

I am particularly pleased to see that the Mangaung Maximum Security Prison
situated in Bloemfontein, which is South Africa's first joint venture
between the Department of Correctional Services and a private prison
operating company - Group 4 Correction Services SA, has a 25-year contract
to manage the facility on behalf of the Department of Correctional
Services. This facility is due to open on 1 July. We encourage more private
partnership ventures, as we believe that this is the best and most cost-
effective way to ensure adequate and acceptable facilities that are
available to cope with the crime problem that does exist.

It is these projects that will ultimately bring about change that is so
desperately needed for the department to realise that its aims and goals
are reached. It is projects like Amakhaya Farm Project and the Birdmen of
Pollsmoor that give one hope that there will be more rehabilitation in
South African prisons. As the proverb says: `` Where there is life there is
hope.''

The provision of additional prison accommodation through a system of
partnerships with the private sector will go a long way towards alleviating
the inadequate facilities that presently exist. We also eagerly await the
official opening of the Ebongweni-Kokstad Maximum Security Prison which has
been somewhat delayed due to the fact that the municipality was unable to
provide the services. We believe that that has now been sorted out.

We also believe that our prisoners could, to a large extent, carry out the
maintenance and the upgrading of our existing prisons. There are skilled
persons amongst them that can assist the department by providing these
services and, at the same time, create a training ground for others. Most
certainly this would keep prisoners occupied and would assist the
department in achieving some of their goals as, at present, they have to
rely on the Department of Public Works, which do not necessarily prioritise
the Department of Correctional Services above any other department.

It is of some concern that the reintegration programme is rather low in
priority and allocated very little extra funding, given the importance of
this programme. There is still a fair amount of criticism that the
department does not do enough to assist the reintegration of prisoners back
into the community. Both the prisoner and his family need to adjust to
their return to normal society.

Likewise, although the department is committed to providing comprehensive
health care, there is, in our opinion, insufficient funding set aside to
deal with the substantive increase in the HIV/Aids problem that we are
facing. The department faces the ever-increasing numbers of prisoners who
are HIV-positive or who have contracted Aids. These figures have risen from
596 in March 1995 to 3 960 as at March 2000. The projections for the future
are mind-blowing.

The department has indicated that there is a need for a coherent
intervention strategy to effectively deal with the pandemic. Whilst we
appreciate the efforts being made by the department, we believe that more
money needs to be ploughed in to assist the department.

We will be pleased to see the introduction of the long-awaited electronic
monitoring system, and there is no doubt that the much-needed inmate
tracking system will assist detention management and enable the officials
to monitor the whereabouts of offenders at all times. The implementation of
the unit management system has certainly assisted the development and
rehabilitation potential of the prison population.

The commitment of the department to stamp out corruption is obvious, and we
are of the opinion that this has contributed to a better system of
corrections over the past year and a more positive attitude amongst
prisoners and staff. Sadly, public perception is that crime revolves around
the Department of Correctional Services. There is a misconception that all
problems related to criminals are the result of inadequate management by
the Department of Correctional Services. Little is understood about our
integrated justice delivery system, and the various role-players, and this
creates much unnecessary and unfair negative criticism of the department,
hence its position the Cinderella in the system.

The department has in fact played a very meaningful and substantial role in
the justice delivery system. Of note is the fact that there has been a
dramatic decline in prison escapes over the past five years, and
specifically since 1999. This certainly can be attributed to more
efficiency on the part of the Department of Correctional Services.

The matter of children and youths in prison still remains a bone of
contention with the IFP, not that we believe that those who have committed
crimes should not be dealt with, but that they should not be placed in
prisons along with hardened adult prisoners. As at 28 February this year,
there were 3 621 children under the age of 18 years, and 66 000 youths
between the ages of 18 and 25, both sentenced and unsentenced, and almost
half of them were unsentenced.

These young people, especially the unsentenced, are of the utmost concern
to me, because of the lack of adequate schooling or training at the most
critical stage of their lives. And it is this category that the Department
of Justice should be concentrating their efforts on. Notwithstanding the
fact that they have or may have committed crimes, they are still young
people with most of their lives ahead of them. The sooner they are dealt
with, the sooner they can be on the mend and make a contribution instead of
being a liability to society.

I look forward to our planned visit to New Zealand in a few weeks' time,
where we will study the restorative justice system which we hope to apply
in this country as well. We hope that this will be an alternative method to
sentencing.

I am pleased that the portfolio committee, now under the chairmanship of Mr
Ben Fihla, is once again active and playing a role in the ongoing
transformation process in the department, as for close on a year this
committee seldom met and certainly was not actively contributing to the
improvement of the system. This has now been changed around and once again
we have an enthusiastic portfolio committee rising to the numerous
challenges of the department.

Having expressed some of my concerns and those of my party, I would again
like to commend the Minister and his departmental officials for being
proactive in all respects and having brought the department a long way from
where it was seven years ago. We support the Minister when he says it is a
group effort, that society and the department need to look together to move
from incarceration to rehabilitation.

We in the IFP commit ourselves to making an ongoing contribution to the
development and improvement of the department and the rehabilitation of
prisoners of all ages, but particularly those young people who could still
offer a great deal to the community, given the opportunity.

We believe that there is still a need to secure criminals as there is to
protect the innocent public. But there is also a need to assist those who
have stumbled to get back on their feet if they can find it in themselves
to get up.

We owe it to them and to society at large to provide opportunities for them
to grow and to become persons that society could be proud to have back. The
presentation of the recent President's gold awards to 47 young offenders
who have excelled in their development programme is just an indication of
what can be achieved.

We wish the Minister and his department well. His efforts and the
transformation thus far are much appreciated. We appeal to the Minister of
Finance to assist this department with an additional allocation, that will
make it possible to create more educational, training and working
opportunities that would lead to rehabilitation that would otherwise not be
possible.

We support the Vote. [Applause.]

Mr L N DIALE: Chairperson, President of South Africa Thabo Mbeki, Deputy
President Jacob Zuma, Minister of Correctional Services, members, and
comrades ...

... dumelang. Ke a leboga go ema mo ke tlo tsea karolo mo ngangisanong ye
ya sekhwama sa bagolegwa. [... I salute all hon members. It is indeed a
privilege for me to stand at this podium and participate in this debate on
the fund for victims of crime.]

My own experiences as a political prisoner have given me valuable insight
into the nature of South African prisons. Under apartheid, prisons were
used to dispose of political opponents of the apartheid regime and pass-law
offenders apprehended by the state. The system operated behind high walls
and was shielded by draconian press legislation which kept these operations
secret.

Our prison system, along with all state institutions, was therefore used to
preserve the apartheid system as one of the security institutions which
were foremost in implementing apartheid. The prison system was
characterised by racism and the killing as well as torture of prisoners.
Prisoners came out of prison worsened by the experience of imprisonment.
They were not given opportunities to improve themselves and they were not
encouraged to prepare themselves for return to their communities.

I am glad to say that this is no longer the situation. Our transition to
democracy has given us the opportunity to transform all apartheid
institutions, including our correctional services system, and to make them
responsive to the needs of a democratic society which is based on human
dignity and respect. Most of our prisoners are from the previously
disadvantaged groups and are poor. Given the historical role of the ANC as
the champion of the interests of the poor it is logical that the
transformation of our correctional services system will place greater
emphasis on the development of our prison population.

We have implemented a new Correctional Services Act which extends basic
human rights to prisoners. The Act places a lot of emphasis on the humane
treatment of prisoners and the need to focus on the development of
prisoners through rehabilitation. Rehabilitation programmes for prisoners
have proved to be an effective way to instil in offenders the cognitive
skills essential to social adaptation and to reducing the rate at which
prisoners fall back into a life of crime.

However, for rehabilitation programmes to work they need the environment
inside prison to be conducive to their implementation. In other words, we
need to address issues such as the lack of personnel and resources,
overcrowding, prison warders who are inadequately trained in the
rehabilitation of prisoners, gangs which manipulate the environment in
prisons, prison warders' attitudes and racial tensions amongst the
Department of Correctional Services staff.

This will require of the department to reassess the kind of programmes it
implements in prison and to determine whether these are successful or need
to be adapted. Equally important is the fact that we need to be supportive
of the social and economic environment outside prison which will help ex-
prisoners to reintegrate peacefully into their communities. This is of
particular significance in our rural areas where support structures and
economic opportunities are lacking, which makes it difficult to absorb
rehabilitated prisoners.

The challenges facing the Department of Correctional Services cannot be
divorced from the enormous challenges facing us as a nation. Most people,
especially the young men who today are in prison, may well have had
problems in their family relationships, in personal relationships at their
schools, in their personal lives with alcohol or drug abuse or in finding
employment. These problems are all a legacy of our apartheid past and will
not be solved by merely locking people up in prison. We need to undo these
apartheid legacies because it is in part these legacies which are driving
our people to criminal behaviour.

Ke leboga go menagane. [Many things.] The ANC supports the Vote.
[Applause.]

Mnr D V BLOEM: Voorsitter, Minister, Nasionale Kommissaris, provinsiale
kommissarisse en lede ...

Mnr M J ELLIS: Van die DA.
Mnr D V BLOEM: ... veral die baie, baie belangrike lede wat op die galery
sit. Ek kan nie die DA eer nie. Ek wil praat oor transformasie. Vanoggend
toe ek inkom, het een van die lede my gevra, wat se klomp koppies en
braaipanne en dinge is daar in die gang. Ek dag eers hy is 'n bandiet en
werk nie hier in die Parlement nie.

Ek het teenoor die agb Moss genoem dat daar transformasie in die
Departement van Korrektiewe Dienste is. Daardie persoon is gewoond aan
tsommos en puzamandlas. Daar word nie meer daardie dinge in die Departement
van Korrektiewe Dienste gekry nie. Die agb Fihla, die voorsitter van die
komitee, is dik geëet en dik gedrink aan tsommos en puzamandla.

Daar is verandering in Korrektiewe Dienste en ek wil net oor twee dinge
praat. Tydens die opening van die Parlement het die President gesê dat
transformasie in hierdie departement net eenvoudig moet plaasvind. Ons is
op pad om dit te doen. Ons slagspreuk is Operasie Skoonmaak. Dit is
toepaslik veral wanneer lede van hierdie departement aangaan met
smokkelary, aangaan om dinge in die gevangenis in te smokkel.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Ek het geweet die opposisie gaan praat van selfone.
Daar is mense van die opposisie wat daar sit en wat mense se geld gesteel
het daar binne in die tronk. Die opposisie praat nie van hulle nie. Daar is
mense van die opposisie wat gemaak het dat mense huil. Daardie lid is een
van die mense wat in die tronk moet sit. [Gelag.] Hy hoort nie hier nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr D V BLOEM: Chairperson, Minister, National Commissioner, provincial
commissioners and members ...

Mr M J ELLIS: Of the DA.

Mr D V BLOEM: ... particularly the very, very important members who are
sitting in the gallery. I cannot honour the DA. I want to talk about
transformation. When I came in this morning, one of the members asked me
what the assortment of cups and pans and things in the passage were. At
first I thought he was a prisoner and did not work here at Parliament.

I mentioned to the hon Moss that there is transformation in the Department
of Correctional Services. That person is used to tsommos and puzamandlas.
Those things are no longer found in the Department of Correctional
Services. The hon Fihla, the chairperson of the committee, has eaten and
drunk his fill of tsommos and puzamandla.

There has been change in Correctional Services and I want to talk about
just two things. During the opening of Parliament the President said that
transformation simply must take place in this department. We are on our way
to doing that. Our slogan is Operation Clean-up. This is particularly
appropriate when members of this department continue to be involved in
smuggling, continue to smuggle things into prison. [Interjections.] I knew
the opposition would talk about cellphones.

There are people from the opposition who are sitting there and who stole
people's money in prison. The opposition does not talk about them. There
are people from the opposition who caused people to cry. That member is one
of the people who should be in prison. [Laughter.] He does not belong
here.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, on a point of order: I am sure you will agree
that what the hon member has just said about the hon Donald Lee is
absolutely and totally unparliamentary. [Interjections.]
Mnr D V BLOEM: Ek sal my woorde terugtrek. Ek sal dit anders stel. Ek het
dit klaar teruggetrek. Maar ons moet versigtig wees as ons dinge gooi na
lede toe, veral in hierdie Huis. Die DA se vriend Abe Williams sit daar in
die gevangenis. Abe Williams sit daar in die gevangenis en die opposisie
skree hier, maar niemand gaan vir Abe besoek of help nie. My plig as 'n lid
van hierdie portefeuljekomitee is om te gaan kyk wat gaan aan daar in die
gevangenisse. Ek sal en moet dit doen, sodat mense nie mishandel word nie.

Ons kom van 'n verlede waar die bewaarder net 'n knuppel geken het. Die
opposisie weet nie van knuppels nie. Hulle was nooit daar waar ons was nie.
Ons weet wat gaan aan binne in 'n gevangenis. Die lid het by die televisie
gesit, en ons mense die hele tyd uitverkoop. Dit is hoekom ons kan sê
wanneer iets nie reg is nie. Ek wil een punt opper, naamlik die salarisse
van daardie mense wat daar op die galery sit. Daardie mense doen uiters
belangrike werk. Daardie mense se lewens is elke minuut van die dag in
gevaar. [Applous.] Ons moet sorg en toesien dat ons daardie lede tevrede
stel, want dan gaan ons beter diens uit hul kry. [Tyd verstreke.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[Mr D V BLOEM: I will withdraw my words. I will put it differently. I have
already withdrawn it. But we must be careful when we level accusations at
members, particularly in this House. The DA's friend, Abe Williams, is in
prison. Abe Williams is sitting in prison and the opposition is screaming
here, but nobody has been to visit or help Abe. It is my duty as a member
of this portfolio committee is to look at what is going on in the prisons.
I must and will do this, so that people are not mistreated.

We come from a past in which the warder only knew a baton. The opposition
does not know about batons. They have never been where we were. We know
what happens inside a prison. The member sat in front of the television,
and sold our people out the entire time. That is why we can say when
something is not right. I want to raise one point, namely the salaries of
those people who are sitting in the gallery. Those people are doing
extremely important work. The lives of those people are in danger every
minute of the day. [Applause.] We must see to it that we satisfy those
members, because then we are going to get better service from them. [Time
expired.]]

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Chair, hon Minister and members of this House, as we debate
the budget of Correctional Services today, we must not lose sight of the
fact that this Minister actually deals with the symptoms of the failure of
several other Ministers, such as Trade and Industry, Labour, Safety and
Security as well as Justice and a few others. [Interjections.]

In January 2001 the hon the Minister announced ambitious plans to reform
South African prisons, and rehabilitation programmes for prisoners. He also
appointed Judge Siraj Desai as the new head of the council, and planned to
appoint his deputy shortly afterwards. We welcomed these appointments.

Die Minister het vroeër hierdie jaar gesê dat hy sy geveg teen geweld en
misdaad in tronke gaan verskerp en dat hierdie saak hoog op sy
prioriteitslys is. Ek moet die agb Minister gelukwens met die goeie
voorneme en beplanning, maar daar is iets ernstigs verkeerd in hierdie land
sou hy besig wees om geweld en misdaad in tronke te beveg. Ons beveg reeds
geweld en misdaad op straat en plaas die misdadigers dan in sy sorg vir
bewaking en rehabilitasie.

Die Minister word verder belas met grootskaalse bedrog en korrupsie in die
departement self. Dit is 'n departement waarvan die personeel en ander
verantwoordelike persone opgelei is om 'n geloofwaardige diens te lewer.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The hon the Minister said earlier this year that he was going to intensify
his fight against violence and crime in prisons and that this matter was
high on his list of priorities. I must congratulate the hon the Minister on
his good intentions and planning, but there is something seriously wrong in
this country if he is fighting violence and crime in prisons. We are
already fighting violence and crime in the streets and are entrusting the
criminals to him to keep them in custody and rehabilitate them.

The hon the Minister is further burdened with large-scale fraud and
corruption in the department itself. This is a department whose staff and
other responsible persons have been trained to provide a reliable service.]

An investigation into Correctional Services as well as the Department of
the Public Service and Administration was launched by the Public Service
Commission. They investigated allegations of serious irregularities in the
human resources management practices, and there had been allegations of
bribery, corruption, sexual harassment and incompetence.

The investigation produced its findings in March 2001 and found, inter
alia, inadequate recruitment selection procedures, poor verification of
qualifications and instances of potential nepotism in staff appointments, a
backlog of filling of advertised posts, insensitive application of the
department's affirmative action policy, bursaries not properly awarded,
disciplinary action and dismissals compromised by a lack of preparations
and planning, the arbitrary handling of staff transfers, unprocedural staff
performance-based cash awards, officials occupying state quarters whilst
still receiving home owners' allowances and the abuse of remunerated
overtime ...

Mr L M KGWELE: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: I wanted to ask the
member ... [Interjections.]

Mrs P W CUPIDO: No, I am not answering a question.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, if you want to ask
a question, it can only be by leave of the speaker at the podium.
[Interjections.]

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Chairperson, I am not answering any questions. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Proceed.

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Chairperson, R68 million was lost to sick leave in the
department during the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000, and there
were shortcomings in human resources management. In addition to 279 cases
of alleged corruption, maladministration, bribery and sexual harassment
that were reported, there were a further 79 cases under investigation.

However bleak this picture looks, we must still commend those officials who
see their responsibility as a calling and who strive towards job
satisfaction in sometimes very difficult circumstances. My prayer for them
is that they will be rewarded as they deserve, and they must keep on doing
that. It is unfortunate to have to say that the problems that were exposed
in this department can also be found in several other departments and
Ministries.

Waar en wanneer gaan dit tog eendag eindig? Ons bevind ons in 'n situasie
in hierdie land waarin ons nog steeds geen lig aan die einde van die tonnel
sien nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Where and when is this then going to come to an end one day? We find
ourselves in a situation in this country in which we still do not see any
light at the end of the tunnel.]

Some of our main strategic policy objectives in the Department of
Correctional Services are ... [Interjections.] You must listen! ... to keep
prisoners in safe custody in a safe environment and humane conditions,
rehabilitation programmes, and reintegration into the community.

I would now like to address the matter of children and women in prisons, as
well as the problem of HIV/Aids. How do the strategic policy objectives
affect the lives of children in prisons? I recently visited Pollsmoor
Prison and was shocked to see the conditions under which the children in
this prison live.

By die verhoorafwagtendes is daar amper dubbel soveel kinders in die selle
as wat daar beddens is. Gevolglik word seuns geforseer om saam op 'n bed te
slaap. Kan agb lede hulle die seksuele wanpraktyke indink waaraan hierdie
kinders blootgestel word? Kinders loop die risiko om met die MI-virus
besmet te word. Toiletgeriewe is kommerwekkend. In die een sel waar daar
baiekeer 50 kinders is, was daar vier toilette, waarvan net een in 'n
werkende toestand was. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Daar is kinders wat al meer as twee jaar lank verhoorafwagtend is.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Besef agb lede dat 'n verhoorafwagtende kind geen
voordele in 'n tronk het nie? Hy het nie 'n bed waarop hy aanspraak kan
maak nie, en hy kry ook geen klere om daagliks om te ruil of basiese
benodigdhede nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Daardie agb lid reageer soos 'n dwaas. Hy moet liewer stilbly!

Sommige kinders bestee lang tydperke in die tronk en baie word nie
noodwendig skuldig bevind nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[Among children awaiting trial there are practically twice as many children
in the cells as there are beds. Consequently boys are forced to sleep
together on a bed. Can hon members imagine the sexual malpractices these
children are exposed to? Children run the risk of being infected with HIV.
Toilet facilities are a cause for concern. In one cell which often
accommodates 50 children, there are four toilets, only one of which is in
working order. [Interjections.]

There are children who have been awaiting trial for more than two years.
[Interjections.] Do hon members realise that an awaiting-trial child has no
benefits in a prison? He does not have a bed that he can lay claim to, and
he does not receive a daily change of clothing or any other basic
necessities. [Interjections.] That hon member is behaving like a fool. He
should rather keep quiet!

Some children spend long periods in prison and many are not necessarily
found guilty.]
Could hon members perhaps see this as sentencing without trial?

Die kans bestaan dat hulle in die tronk leer om geharde misdadigers te
word. Inligting wat ek van die departement aangevra het, lui dat daar 1 984
kinders onder die ouderdom van 18 in Suid-Afrikaanse tronke is. Die
Minister sê egter in die Business Day van 31 Mei 2001 dat daar 3 621
kinders onder die ouderdom van 18 in tronke is. Op wie se statistiek is ek
nou veronderstel om te werk; die Minister of die departement s'n? En dit is
die mees onlangse inligting wat ek kon kry.

Ek bring verder onder agb lede se aandag dat ons tronke vol jongmense is.
Daar is 4 600 agtienjarige kinders, 3 484 neëntienjariges, 3 651
twintigjariges en meer as 15 000 jongmense in die ouderdomsgroep 21 tot 25
jaar. Vir so 'n aantal kinders van skoolgaande ouderdom het ons ongeveer 20
skole met hostelle en veilige bewaringsgeriewe nodig om hulle te
rehabiliteer, 'n opvoeding te gee en hulle bekend te stel aan 'n beter
lewensgehalte. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[There is a chance that they will learn to become hardened criminals while
in prison. Information that I have requested from the department states
that there are 1 984 children under the age of 18 in South African prisons.
However, the Minister said in Business Day of 31 May 2001 that there are 3
621 children under the age of 18 in prisons. Whose statistics am I supposed
to use; the Minister's or the department's? And that is the most recent
information I could get.

I also want to bring it to the attention of hon members that our prisons
are full of young people. There are 4 600 eighteen year olds, 3 484
nineteen year olds, 3 651 twenty year olds and more than 15 000 young
people between the ages of 21 and 25 years. For such a large number of
children of school-going age we require approximately 20 schools with
hostels and safe custody facilities in order to rehabilitate them, provide
them with an education and introduce them to a better quality of life.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your speaking time
has expired. [Interjections.]

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Bloem, jy moet 'n bietjie luister, dan sal jy hoor wat die
feite daar buite is! [Tussenwerpsels.] [Bloem, you should listen, then you
will hear what the facts are out there! [Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, are you receiving
your translation clearly? I am having a great deal of difficulty. I wonder
if the translation service could attempt to improve the quality of their
sound?

Correctional Services Mr Skosana, hon members, before I proceed with my
contribution, I should like to say this to the Minister:]

Wat ek vir die Minister wil sê, is dat as 'n mens dwalend is, is jy
dwalend, vernaam as die spook jou laat dwaal het. As 'n mens byvoorbeeld
vir hom of haar wys 'n rivier is vol, kan die persoon dit glad nie sien
nie, want hy of sy is dwalend. So, vir die mevrou om so te wees is
heeltemal dwalend. [Gelag.] Die spook wat haar laat dwaal het, is die DA.
Ons is die regte mense wat van hierdie probleme kan praat, want ons was
daar. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[What I want to tell the Minister is that if one is confused one is
confused, especially if a ghost caused one to become confused. For example,
if one shows that person a full river, the person cannot see it at all,
because he or she is confused. So, for the lady to be like that she has to
be completely confused. [Laughter.] The ghost that caused her to become
confused is the DA. We are the right people to talk about these problems,
because we were there.]

[Legofsi.] (Translation of Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[The subject of my speech today is focused on mothers who protect their
children by every means at their disposal - the Boledis and others who have
nurtured us in this world. I want to remind the hon Minister that, compared
to prison populations in other countries in Southern Africa, there are more
than 4 000 female prisoners in our country while it is estimated that there
are 110 children in prison with their mothers.

It is therefore important that we remain vigilant with regard to this
matter of female prisoners. Let me give an example of a female prisoner who
was imprisoned whilst pregnant. Of course, it is common knowledge that a
pregnant woman tends to crave fruit, such as apples, and vegetables. Quite
frankly, the nutrients in that fruit are needed by the little baby within
her. Some women are convicted whilst they are pregnant. Let us consider the
case of a woman who is impregnated by a man who then deserts her with two
or three children.

I propose that the department must, within its available resources, make
provision for nutritional food such as vegetables, apples, pears and other
fruit, so that they are on hand for pregnant women who are serving prison
terms. Hon members know that a malnourished pregnant woman tends to give
birth to a baby characterised, inter alia, by an extremely oversized head
and very thin bowed legs. This is the result of maternal malnutrition. Even
though the mother-to-be is rightfully serving her prison sentence, what is
within her is indeed innocent; and it is incumbent upon us to care for it.

I would like to give the Minister another example. In 1998 we visited
England. I was fascinated to see rolls of material and sewing machines
where female prisoners were being taught sewing skills. The products of
their handicraft are sold and the department of prisons benefits
financially from that. What is important is that the work done by prisoners
whilst they are still incarcerated will definitely help them fend for
themselves when they are released from prison.

Most of the estimated 4 700 female prisoners in South Africa were not
convicted of serious crimes. They were convicted after committing such
minor crimes as stealing food or meat. Since these women have four to five
children each to feed, and some of them were deserted by their spouses, it
is important that the department should train them so that by the time they
are released from prison they will be in a position to fend for themselves.

Furthermore, the Minister should note that some of the prisons are already
developing, and we are satisfied with the work done by his Ministry in this
regard. We saw this when we were visiting prisons around the country.
However, the old lady over there will continue to criticise the Government
because she was told by her boss to do exactly that. We should understand
that if she does not criticise the Government, her boss, the hon Tony Leon
will fire her. Therefore, she has no alternative but to keep on
criticising, criticising and criticising. [Laughter.] I want to tell hon
members that deep in her heart she is satisfied that things are going very
well in Government.

My honest appeal to the Minister is that we should consider setting up some
pre-schools with suitably qualified educators in some of the existing
prison institutions so that they could cater for the education of children
of two to four years, who are with their mothers in prison. This will help
our children to grow up knowing that they are at school and not in prison,
and that by the time their mothers are released from prison they should see
no difference between the education they received in prison and the
education they receive at school. I think this can help them greatly.

Another point I want to raise is that one day we visited Athlone in Cape
Town. There is a huge building which accommodates about 90 juveniles. These
are naughty children, and some of them told us that they were serving
prison terms. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Dr S E MZIMELA: Chairperson, in a debate such as this one, one is tempted
either to complain and condemn or to commend and congratulate. I shall try
to do neither, because we are dealing here with a human tragedy.

If Correctional Services was a capitalist business, certainly, today we
would be rubbing our hands and praising ourselves because our customer base
has increased so rapidly, from 96 000 in 1994 to over 170 000 in 2001. That
is phenomenal growth, and if one were to take into consideration the number
of prisoners who have benefited from the various concessions which have
been granted by the Government, remissions etc, then the figure would be
well over 250 000. But, that is only one set of figures.
If we look at another set, the cost of those customers has also increased
rapidly. It now stands at R6,1 billion, up from R5,6 billion last year, an
increase of 8,8%. That is a high increase indeed. As businesspeople then,
in terms of our paradigm, we would soon realise that we were operating at a
loss.

Fortunately, today the Minister has given us a new approach. He said we are
to move away from incarceration to rehabilitation. That is to be accepted
and welcomed. But it, too, comes at a price and it needs the full support
of this House, not mere talk but real support, for if we are going to
successfully rehabilitate, then the people who are going to do the job of
rehabilitation must be trained as rehabilitators. They cannot receive the
same training as people who are going to be mere warders or those who are
going to lock and open the doors.

The budget will, then, have to be substantially increased, for
rehabilitation includes various skills which are costly. It includes
various programmes and participations by outside organisations, which are
costly. This means then that this whole Parliament will have to stand
behind the Department of Correctional Services in approaching the Ministry
of Finance's Treasury to present a unified programme of rehabilitation and
to ask for more funding.

This makes common sense. This increase between 1994 and the present has
been money virtually thrown away. There has been nothing in return. The
people who come out of prison - most of them - after being on the streets
for a few months, go back. It is a losing battle. So rehabilitation must
not be taken lightly. We must give it our full support.

There is also another more important angle to rehabilitation, and that is
the community at large. Our people, downtrodden by crime and suffering and
victims of crime, do not want to see people released. They want us to
incarcerate them and throw away the keys.

If people are going to be rehabilitated they must be able to return to an
environment which will accept them, people who will understand that they
have paid for their crimes, that they have been rehabilitated, that they
are new people fit to serve in the new South Africa. That means a massive
programme to educate our communities, and only then will this programme of
rehabilitation, which deserves our support, succeed.
We support the budget, but ask for more money. [Applause.]

Ms E NGALEKA: Chairperson, hon Minister of Correctional Services and hon
members, our history has been a bitter one, dominated by colonialism,
racism, apartheid and repressive education policies. The result is that
every sphere of our society is confronted with serious problems. There is
not a single sector untouched by the ravages of apartheid.

As a partner in the criminal justice system, Correctional Services is not
only responsible for the detention of the offender for the duration of his
or her sentence, but ultimately also for the successful reintegration of
the offender into the community.

This is what Karl Menninger has to say about imprisonment:


  After a solemn public ceremony we pronounce them enemies of the people
  and consign them for arbitrary periods to institutional confinement on
  the basis of laws written many years ago. Here they languish until time
  has ground out so many weary months and years. Then with the planlessness
  and stupidity only surpassed by that of their original incarceration,
  they are dumped back on society, regardless of whether any change has
  taken place in them for the better and with every assurance that changes
  have taken place in them for the worse. Once more they enter the unequal
  tussle with society. Proscribed for employment by most concerns, they are
  expected to invent a new way to make a living and to survive without
  further help from society.

For many prisoners released after a term of imprisonment, the reality is:
No plans, no direction and no assistance. To continue with this strategy is
futile. Society cannot incarcerate people for periods of time and then
expect them to have transformed themselves.

There is growing evidence that alternatives to long-term confinement are
just as effective as prison for many offenders. We need to get public
support and to change public attitudes through education for these
alternatives to work. Community corrections have fewer return customers
than do prisons. The probationer stays within the community and is exposed
to the normal influences of the community. He is not exposed to the
negative influences of hardened criminals, he is able to care for his
family and he can accept responsibility for himself and his family. He
keeps his job and still contributes to the economy.

In terms of the South African Constitution, prisoners enjoy a number of
special rights, such as protection from torture and cruel and inhuman
punishment. In terms of the approach to offender reintegration, this is
important as it has formally established the position of the offender and
prisoner in society. He or she is a member of society with human rights but
specific rights are temporarily curtailed.

Community involvement in prisons requires the active and voluntarily
participation of the public and it requires prison officials to respond to
problems in the community in a different way. This involvement assumes a
need for greater accountability by prison authorities, greater public
participation in decision-making and greater concern for civil rights and
liberties by prison authorities. In terms of section 92(1) of the
Correctional Services Act, independent prison visitors must be appointed
for various prisons throughout South Africa, primarily to deal with
complaints of prisoners by regular visits, private prisoner interviews,
recording complaints and monitoring the manner in which they have been
dealt with.
Parole is the release of a prisoner after serving a specific portion of his
or her sentence under continued supervision of the state with limited
freedoms. Since March 1994 parole boards have been established. Their work
revolves around making recommendations regarding paroling prisoners.
However, there is a great need to involve the entire community in this
process. Currently the composition of these boards does not reflect a
balanced representation of all races within the South African context. Few
blacks, if any, are serving in such structures. The structures were created
under the apartheid system of government and their creation was
undemocratic, because those most affected were not consulted. These boards
should be community boards rather than bureaucratic boards.

The RDP, which is regarded as the vehicle towards nation-building, also
underpins the concept of accountability and the role of civil society in
influencing Government policy and programmes within it. The reconstruction
of society should also extend to the upliftment of prisoners as members of
the entire society. We need to transform the prisons in creating a better
life. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, hon Minister, clearly the most serious challenge
facing Correctional Services is that of overcrowding in the prisons. The
President of the Constitutional Court recently expressed his deep sense of
shock at the appalling conditions occasioned by overcrowding at Diepkloof
Prison, particularly amongst the awaiting-trial prisoners.

The inspecting judge, Judge Fagan, has similarly drawn attention to the
inhumane conditions in certain prisons, and the urgent need to curtail the
spread of disease, while still manageable. The number of deaths in prison
attributable to disease has increased by 584% over the past five years,
most of which were caused by HIV/Aids. Of a total prison population of
approximately 170 000, 57 695 are awaiting-trial, many of whom may well be
acquitted. Many thousands of these awaiting-trial prisoners are exposed to
these deplorable conditions and run the risk of becoming infected with HIV,
resulting in an indirect death sentence.

Judge Fagan has suggested various methods of reducing the number of
awaiting-trial prisoners, as well as of sentenced prisoners. Prime amongst
his recommendations is the usage of restorative justice principles, such as
pre-trial diversion, especially for juveniles.

The appeal of this model, particularly when considered against the huge
backlog of criminal cases, lies in the acceptance of blame by the offender
and the recognition of the need to make restitution to the victim. Once
this stage has been reached, the restorative justice process can commence.
Unfortunately, this has not been the traditional approach where the
offender has sought to evade accountability, and the legal process has
degenerated into a lengthy contest between the state and the defence
lawyers to establish guilt or obtain an acquittal. The ACDP welcomes the
approach and would encourage the Minister to pursue this in the safety and
security cluster.

In conclusion, the ACDP commends the hon the Minister and all members of
the department for the work they have performed under extremely difficult
conditions of overcrowding. [Applause.]

Mr M M Z DYANI: Chairperson, Minister of Correctional Services and august
House, it pleases me to take part in a debate on Correctional Services.
What pleases me is the capacity I now have to influence changes in
Correctional Services.

Prison and imprisonment are very bad for the physical and mental health of
humans, but because of the unacceptable and horrible behaviour of some
people in society, we are unable to totally dispense with imprisonment. As
we reward those members of our society who do good, we justifiably punish
those who do bad through tampering with the equilibrium of justice and
peace. However, we do not punish the wrongdoers to satisfy our retributive
tastes, but we do so as a just method of correction and rehabilitation.

Rehabilitation means the successful psychological and philosophical
readjustment of the offender to the best values and norms of the offender's
community. Rehabilitation and successful reintegration into the mainstream
of society of an offender are the ideal that constitutes the only
justification for the existence of the institution of prison. We are keenly
aware that imprisonment alone cannot and does not positively change the
behaviour of a person and that imprisonment alone cannot deter potential
offenders from committing crime. Contending or believing otherwise is
pathetically idealistic in the philosophical sense.

Starvation and poverty are the primary causes of crime. I do not say that
starvation and poverty are the only causes of crime. There cannot be any
argument about the connection of starvation and poverty to the commission
of crime. It therefore forcefully means that any endeavours towards
correction and rehabilitation of offenders are doomed to fail if the social
causes impelling people to break the law are not taken into full account.
Because of socioeconomic reasons, there are very few women in our prisons
compared to the number of women in this country. There are very few white
males in our prisons compared to the number of white males in this country.

South African prisons are dangerously overcrowded. They are bursting at the
seams. They are pregnant with black males, the breadwinners of the majority
of our population - the poor people. Let hon members go to the low courts
now and see the class of people they will find there. Let hon members go to
the prisons now and see the class of people who are there. The only sure
way of reducing crime and correcting offenders is through more efforts at
correcting the economic imbalances that remain intact in our society due to
the crazed attitude of those who enriched themselves through violence and
inhuman means, including racially articulated capitalism, of which
apartheid was a political handmaiden.

Let me emphasise that trying to correct prisoners without trying, at the
same time, to address the causes that give offenders a reason to risk
breaking the law is merely a statistic ritual. I know this for a fact
because from the age of 18 to the age of 33 I endured retributive
imprisonment by people who believed that the meaning of my life meant and
potented everything evil for them.

Let me now provide hon members with statistics gleaned from a booklet
titled ``After prison'' by Lucas Mantee and also from statistics provided
by the Department of Correctional Services, and show what is happening with
the prison population. I will then deal with the health of prisoners and
what the department is doing about it.

Lucas Mantee states that of the first 10 countries with the largest prison
population, South Africa holds the seventh position. He further states that
in 1999 for every 100 000 people there were 390 prisoners. By July 2000,
the prison population had reached a total of 169 486. Thirty-four per cent
of that number were awaiting-trial prisoners. He correctly contends that
the said 34% is an enormous strain on the resources. He further explains a
worrying factor that, by July 1996, the average detention cycle for an
awaiting-trial prisoner was 76 days. This had increased by July 2000 to 138
days.

The following are some of the statistical facts he furnishes. For regional
court cases, the average period is 221 days or seven and a half months. The
current estimated cost of imprisonment is R86 per day per prisoner or R31
390 per year. On the basis of this, he accurately comments that it is not
surprising that the Correctional Services budget grew so rapidly from R751
million in 1989-90 to R3,51 billion in 1997-98. It further rose to R5,78
billion in 2000-01.

He also highlights the problem of the phenomenal growth in the prisoner
population, while the population growth of warders is infinitesimal. He
states that the warder-prisoner ratio reported in 1997-98 as being 124,5
was an increase from the previous year of only 1 to 3,47 prisoners. The
current warder-prisoner ratio, as given by the department, is one member of
the custodial section to 5,36 prisoners and for community corrections it is
one member to 34,86 supervision cases. The custodial and community
corrections staff consists of a total of 32 877 members managing 112 492
sentenced prisoners.

Prisoner health is attended by sessional doctors, some of whom are district
surgeons. There are full-time doctors in some big centres but, due to
financial constraints, not all big centres have the benefit of a full-time
doctor.

On 28 February 2001 there were 36 000 HIV cases and 206 Aids cases in our
prisons. These are the known cases. All prisoners are either seen by a
medical officer or a doctor when ill. When prisoners arrive in prison for
the first time, they are routinely checked medically to determine the
health status of each individual prisoner. This is primarily done to ensure
the early detection of contagious diseases, for their early control and
management.

The department makes every effort to prevent the increase and spread of all
diseases within the precincts of prisons. This is done in strict conformity
with the health policies of the Government. Prisoners with diseases such as
HIV/Aids and hepatitis B and C are not shunned by the department. They are
treated in the same way they would be treated by sensible and knowledgeable
people outside prison. They are only isolated or confined when their
diseases have reached a stage where they can necessarily infect other
inmates or officers. This happens during the discharge of bodily fluids and
when such a discharge is known as the advanced stage of a disease.

Prisoners are not forced to undergo HIV testing and their HIV status is
kept confidential between the inmate and the prison authority. Because of
the stubborn reality of sexual activity in prisons, the department makes
condoms available. Known HIV-positive inmates receive the necessary
counselling to equip them to cope with living with HIV. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, Minister, the main objective of the
Department of Correctional Services is to maintain and promote peace,
safety and security in accordance with the Correctional Services Act of
1998. The department also aims to keep prisoners in safe custody while
providing in the basic needs of prisoners under humane conditions and
assisting prisoners with integration into the community.

Currently the department is faced with the problem of catering for the
growing population of prisoners, which grew from 121 500 in 1996 to 162 000
in September 2000. This problem has resulted in overcrowding in prisons and
it is absolutely vital for the department to build additional accommodation
over the medium term so as to increase prison capacity.

The MF is looking forward to the reinforcement of electronic monitoring
technology which will oversee the monitoring of 8 850 probationers and
parolees by March 2004. The MF welcomes the establishment of the Good
Governance Unit which will conduct inspections and audits and run
anticorruption programmes. It is also encouraging to hear that the
department is shifting the working week of prison staff from a five-day to
a seven-day week in order to reduce overtime costs.

The MF applauds the Government for the increase in the budget from R5,6
billion in 2001-02 to R6,1 billion for 2002-03. This indicates a rapid
growth in the Correctional Services budget over the period of seven years.
The increased allocation in the budget will allow for the construction of
additional prisons over the medium term and contribute towards the increase
of the operational cost associated with higher prisoner numbers.

The MF is more than satisfied with the department for adopting an approach
to the assessment and rehabilitation of offenders in which
multidisciplinary teams consisting of social workers, psychologists,
religious and spiritual workers, educators, correctional officials and
others from the external community will ensure appropriate placement, care
and development for all prisoners.

The statistics in respect of the crime rate in our country are quite
alarming and ever increasing. As we speak, over the past weekend the close-
knit community of Chatsworth in KwaZulu-Natal once again fell victim to
approximately five murders. This has left the law-abiding citizens of the
community in a state of shock and distrust and has instilled more fear
among them.

The MF recommends that the elimination of crime should begin at grass-roots
level. Community leaders and established members of the community need to
liaise closely with local and provincial councillors and members of
Parliament in formulating and implementing effective strategies to combat
crime at all levels.

The MF applauds the increased budget allocations to the various relevant
programmes. The MF supports Vote 19: Correctional Services. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I am just waiting for the
House. Too many people are engaged in private conversations. Please keep
your voices down.

Ms B O DLAMINI: Chairperson, Minister of Correctional Services, hon members
and members of the staff of the Department of Correctional Services, the
department recently briefed the committee about the review of the White
Paper on Correctional Services. In its presentation to the committee, the
department raised the need to introduce a system that will complement
retributive justice, and that is restorative justice. According to Donald
and Evans restorative justice is: ``a way of thinking about harm and
conflict, and a way of acting on that thinking''.
This approach complements the rehabilitation of offenders. What makes it
different is that it calls for a partnership between the offender, the
victim, the community and the Government.

Ngalolu hlelo iziboshwa azibi umthwalo kaHulumeni kuphela. Umphakathi uba
ingxenye yohlelo lokushintshwa kweziboshwa. Omunye umahluko ngalolu hlelo,
ukuthi ludinga imiphakathi ezimisele ukwemukela iziboshwa esezikade zenza
izenzo ezingamukeleki emphakathini. Ludinga futhi umphakathi ozimisele
ngokuxola. Ukuxola-ke emphakathini wethu akusiyo inkinga etheni ngoba nakhu
sabaxolela nabantu abenza izimpilo zethu zabanzima ngesikhathi
sobandlululo. Manje sebeshaya sengathi akaze benze lutho olubi.

IsiZulu sithi alikho iqili elizikhotha emhlane. Kodwa bona manje bazama
ukuzikhotha emhlane. U-Cupido ushaya sengathi zonke izinsuku uhamba
ecimezile, evale izindlebe ngoshintsho olwenzeke lapha eNingizimu Afrika
selokhu kwathatha uHulumeni we-ANC. U-Cupido futhi akejwayele ukuba
semihlanganweni yamakomiti. Kulolu hlelo, ngaphambi kokuthi kuqhutshekelwe
phambili, isiboshwa kumele sivume ukuthi sonile nokuthi sizobanxephezela
abantu esibahlukumezile.

Leli ithuba lokuthi imiphakathi ibambe iqhaza elivelele ekulwiseni
nasekuqedeni ubugebengu. Umphakathi kumele usize iziboshwa ukuthi
zishintshe impilo yazo, ziphinde zibe ingxenye yomphakathi. Lokhu kuzosiza
ekuvimbeni ukuthi iziboshwa ziphume zingena ejele zize zithathe ijele
njengekhaya lazo lesibili. Abahlukunyeziwe kulolu hlelo bathola ithuba
lokuhlangana nesiboshwa khona naso sizothola ithuba lokuqonda ukuthi senza
umonakalo ongakanani kumuntu, emndenini wakhe, emphakathini nobuhlungu
esibubange kuloyo muntu ngesikhathi simhlukumeza.

Akuyona into elula le. Ngakho-ke idinga ukuthi kube khona izinhlangano
ezizokwazi ukuthi zibahlanganise futhi kube nabantu abazobasiza ukuthi
bafike esixazululweni senkinga. Lolu hlelo luzosiza futhi ukuthi
imiphakathi iyeke ukuthi ihlale ikhala ngezinga lobugebengu eMzansi Afrika.
Kodwa izothola ithuba lokuzibambela mathupha ekulweni nasekuqedeni
ubugebengu. Lokhu kuzonciphisa eminye imikhuba esiyigilayo singabantu
bemiphakathi, yokufihla izigebengu ngoba zingabafowethu, odadewethu,
abantabethu noma abathandiweyo bethu. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs
follows.)

[Through that programme, prisoners will not be a burden to the Government.
Society becomes part of the programme of transforming prisoners. Another
difference in respect of this programme is that it needs communities that
are prepared to accept prisoners who have done terrible things to them. It
requires communities that are prepared to forgive. Forgiving is not a
problem in our communities, because we have even forgiven those who made
our lives miserable during apartheid. Today they pretend that they have not
done anything wrong.

The Zulu saying goes: ``Not a single trickster can lick his own back''.
Today all of them are trying to lick their own backs. Cupido pretends to be
walking with her eyes closed every day, and as if he is shutting her ears
to the changes that have taken place since the ANC came into power. Cupido
does not attend committee meetings on a regular basis. In this programme,
before we go on, a prisoner should admit that he has erred and that he will
compensate those he has wronged.

This is the opportunity for communities to take part in monitoring and
stopping crime. Communities should help prisoners to change their lives and
return to the communities and become part of them again. This will help to
stop prisoners who have entered prison from regarding prison as their
second home. Victims get an opportunity to meet a prisoner, so that he too
will understand the extent of the damage he had caused to his victim, his
family, his community as well as the pain he caused his victims.

This is not an easy programme. There is a need for organisation that will
bring both sides together and people who will help them to arrive at the
solution to the problem. This programme will assist in stopping communities
from crying about the level of crime in South Africa. They will get an
opportunity to take part in fighting and stopping crime. This will reduce
some of the bad habits we practice as community members, such as hiding
criminals just because they are our children, brothers, sisters and loved
ones.]

What is important about restorative justice is that the offender finds a
way of paying back the community through involvement in different
programmes that are accepted by communities, and that are considered as
being of value. This helps the offender to leave the past behind and focus
on the future. It seeks to change the way prisoners were treated before,
namely like animals, to more responsible citizens. Restorative justice
seems more logical and positive, but it is not going to eradicate crime
overnight, because the problems that we have today have been left for a
long time without any intervention, and the apartheid government did not
care about transforming prison services.

The ANC believes that there must be a starting point, and we are at a stage
when most offenders are admitting what they have done to communities. This
is seen through gangsters who have been able to come forward and openly
accept responsibility for the crimes they have committed. This initiative
must be taken further so that offenders can be directly accountable to the
victims and to the community, with the aim of restoring damage and harm
which have been done to the victim, the family and the community.

Lolu hlelo, njengoba sesishilo, ngeke lube lula. Imiphakathi yethu yona
sibona ukuthi ngeke ibe nenkinga yokulwamukela lolu hlelo ngoba ngesikhathi
sikahulumeni wobandlululo imiphakathi yethu ibikade iyingxenye yobulungiswa
ezindaweni zethu. Izinkinga eziqondene nobugebengu bezixoxwa ezindaweni
esihlala kuzo.

paragraphs follows.)

[As we have said, this is not going to be an easy programme. We assume that
our communities will not have a problem in accepting this programme,
because during apartheid our communities were part of the justice system in
our areas. Crime-related matters were discussed in the areas in which we
lived.

This was done because police were not prepared to protect our communities.
They came only to arrest people who were fighting for the freedom of the
oppressed in South Africa. Therefore, our communities have knowledge of
combating crime. The difference is that some members of the police are now
more than prepared to work together with communities to combat crime.
Therefore, it is going to be easy for people to communicate with
Correctional Services so as to solve the problem.

This can also help to prevent people from taking the law into their own
hands. Instead, they will work together with law enforcement agencies. This
programme expects civil organisations, churches and community organisations
to find jobs for prisoners so that they will be able to pay back their
victims or compensate them for those things that they have stolen. This
will stop them from falling into the same trap again.]

This approach is going to put the system into context. This is what the ANC
has been calling for in relation to the transformation of Correctional
Services. The ANC believes that prisons must not be seen as punishment
centres, but must be seen as centres for preparing offenders to work with
communities in dealing with crime and other problems in our communities.

This programme falls within the ambit of the new development of offenders.
Budget provisions for the programme have increased by an average of 14% a
year from 1997-98 to 2000-2001, and this proves to our communities that the
ANC-led Government is prepared to deal with crime. This programme is going
to address our real concern of overcrowding because the Correctional
Services budget will increasingly address the concern that it is not easy
to rehabilitate offenders in an overcrowded prison. Spending of the budget
will make a direct impact through changing the lives of offenders and our
communities for the better.

Lastly, some institutions have taken up the challenge of transformation. I-
ANC iyasisekela lesi sabiwomali. [The ANC supports this budget.] [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Mr Chairperson, a budget is a financial map that indicates the
route a department will embark on for the following financial year. This
route must indicate the policy of Government and should be embodied in the
vision statement of a department. The budget should also strive to achieve
policy objectives. Only when one is sure that the infrastructure, the
expertise and the political will exist in a department can one approve the
budget.

Throughout the budget debates, speakers from the ANC constantly reminded us
of our past. The discussions in this House resembled a history lesson on
apartheid and colonialism. It is clear that members of the Government ANC-
SACP alliance are thoroughly versed in the social and economic impact of
apartheid and the colonialism of our past. What saddens me is the lack of
vision and intent to deal with the needs of our people now.

Effective teaching is nonexistent in most of our townships. Cosas and Sadtu
sound like an old 78-rpm record repeating protest and struggle slogans as
if they perceive the ANC to do less than the apartheid government. More
than one million jobs have been lost since 1994. Crime, especially crime
against black people, has reached critical proportions. The ANC allows
innocent children like Nkosi Johnson to become infected with HIV and die a
cruel and painful death.

The President refuses to admit that HIV causes Aids. The Minister of Health
is unwilling to accept the offer of pharmaceutical companies to make
antiretrovirals available to pregnant mothers. HIV/Aids is becoming a worse
mass killer than Attila the Hun or Hitler. [Interjections.]

Owing to the inability of the criminal justice system to deal with crime,
our prisons are overcrowded. If we look at the latest figures, we see that
the South African prison capacity is for 102 000 prisoners, yet it had
170 000 inmates in February this year. This situation constitutes an
average overpopulation of 66% and a total accommodation-capacity need for
68 000 prisoners. [Interjections.]

It is impossible to protect our young people against HIV-infection in
prison and rehabilitation has a snowball's hope in hell. Young people
sometimes end up in prison because of the socioeconomic problems in our
country. Overcrowding makes it impossible to rehabilitate them and prisons
become universities of crime. [Interjections.]

We need to find new ways of leading our young people away from crime and
indicating a better way to them. Mark Wiley, the former DA minister of law
and order in the Western Cape, is doing revolutionary work at his centre in
Cape Town where young people are taught life skills, discipline and job
skills. This Government can learn from him. [Interjections.]

President Thabo Mbeki said: ``The people have spoken.'' [Interjections.] I
say that the people are still speaking, but not with their votes. They are
expressing their anger by burning Pretoria Station, fighting Eskom and
rejecting ANC councillors and local government structures. [Interjections.]
I appeal to members to take heed when the people speak; their tomorrow
depends on it. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Mr Bloem, are you rising
on a point of order? [Interjections.] Order! [Interjections.]

Mr D V BLOEM: No, Chairperson, it is OK. [Interjections.]

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Chairperson ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! [Interjections.] Hon members,
please contain yourselves.

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Chairperson, listening to the hon Durand is like
listening to His Master's Voice. [Applause.] We have listened to him, and
in Afrikaans we would say: ``'n Leë blik maak net 'n hol geluid en lewer
geen bydrae nie.'' [Empty vessels make the most noise.] [Interjections.]
[Laughter.]

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: I would like to know
if the member Oosthuizen himself is not the master? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, that is not a
point of order. Please do not rise on something that is not a point of
order!

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Mr Chairman, typically and predictably of the DA, the
hon Durand today came and tried to make politics of something that is a
tragedy, namely Aids. [Interjections.] He tried to score a political point
- a weak point - because they are forever losers in this country.
[Applause.]

He referred to a lack of vision from this Government and this Minister. He
clearly did not listen. He should get himself a hearing aid, because the
Minister, this morning, came out with a clear vision for this department.
[Applause.] The DA, through Mr Smit and Mrs Cupido, touched on corruption.
Corruption is nothing new in this country. [Interjections.] It was thriving
in the days of the NP government. [Applause.] Corruption in the Department
of Correctional Services is nothing new. Numerous commissions were
appointed in the days of the NP government to investigate corruption.

It was our Comrade President Mbeki, in line with his vision for a
Millennium African Recovery Programme for our continent and our country,
who has acted swiftly to address a deeply flawed management system in the
Department of Correctional Services, a management system characterised by
mismanagement and manipulation.

It was in April 2000 that a competent public manager was, as an interim
arrangement, appointed to head the Department of Correctional Services for
a defined period of time. On 4 May 2000, a strategic management team was
appointed by President Mbeki to assist the new acting commissioner. Their
task was to act decisively on issues emerging from investigations of the
Department of the Public Service and Administration and the Public Service
Commission.

On 16 March this year, 2001, these departments presented their findings of
the investigations. Steps to address these findings of the investigations
are already well advanced. Some investigations on some criminal matters,
such as corruption and the Sithole scholarship fund, are still going on.
This speaks of a Government which is committed to good governance, and
headed by a President who embraces transparency with zero tolerance for
corruption. Suffice it to say, we in the ANC are proud and honoured to be
blessed with leadership which is committed to transparency and good
governance. [Applause.] One can only hope that the example set by the ANC
leadership will encourage this weak, vulnerable opposition to be more
proactive in their approach in Parliament.

The hon member of the opposition also mentioned overcrowding. Correctional
services is at the receiving end of the criminal justice chain.
[Interjections.] Overcrowding is the result of better and more effective
policing. Strong co-ordination between the police, intelligence, prisons
and the Justice Ministry resulted in some 200 syndicate leaders and more
than 200 syndicate members being arrested up to February 2001.

The hon Durand is making continuous interjections. Let me remind him that
after 1994, this new democratic South Africa, left unprepared by his
government, the NP-led government ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: The doors were flung wide open for syndicates to
infiltrate. There was absolutely no preparation from the previous regime to
protect the new South Africa against the infiltration of the Mafia and
syndicates into this country. I would like to tell Durand that it is us in
the ANC, who are addressing that. [Applause.]

Overcrowding, although it is totally unacceptable, is nothing new in this
country. It has been ever present, and to hon Durand, the sad part of
overcrowding is that when the opposition had the political power to address
this very problem, they did nothing. [Applause.]

Let us look at the capital expenditure on infrastructure and building more
prisons. We had fights here when he was still out somewhere ...
[Interjections] ... and I do not know where, sir. We were fighting for
money to build prisons. It is the ANC-led Government that has implemented
the APOPS prisons, and has embarked on a constructive and productive route
to address the issue of overcrowding. We have heard the Minister saying so
today.

The question now is: Should this Government come with a holistic approach
to address this problem, will we have the support of the Democratic
Alliance? No, we will not have their support. They will be obstructive. So,
the effectiveness in  making a positive contribution towards crime
prevention and, therefore,  overcrowding, depends on our ability to strike
a proper balance between eradication of recidivism through rehabilitation
and welfare, and ensuring community safety through incarceration.

We all know that unemployment is one of the factors contributing to crime.
We also know that the vast majority of inmates in the prison system are
from the previously disadvantaged groups who are totally unskilled. We have
to find the treasure in every man in prison and in every inmate, and we
have to equip them with the necessary skills. If the hon Durand were to end
up there I would also find the treasure in him. [Interjections.] We will
have to find the treasure in them. We will have to equip them. We will have
to equip them with the necessary skills so that one day when they are
released they can find a job in the community in which they find
themselves.

Overcrowding demands a constructive approach. We accept the fact that the
release of a prisoner is not a cure. It needs a realistic approach. It
demands alternative sentencing, community correction, restorative justice
and a streamlined, effective parole system supported by electronic
monitoring. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Mr Chairperson, I am glad that I can
see that most of the points raised here are generally common concerns, and
I am glad that members have raised them when members of the Correctional
Services management are also here to hear these concerns and some of our
Correctional Services staff are also over there so that they can hear what
members are saying. [Interjections.]

I can also see the young ones there. I do not know whether, after they have
heard this, they would like to visit prison. They must not do that. If they
go there it must simply be to take food for somebody but not to go and stay
there. It is not a good place. They have heard the debates in here. It is
not a good place for them.

I will simply respond briefly to points raised here. As I said, these are
general concerns. In response to what the chairperson, hon Mr Fihla, said,
yes, we do have this spending growth in various aspects, in incarceration
and in training. However, I think he is also right when he talks about the
perception about HIV/Aids. We need to debate this issue very thoroughly
because there are different perceptions. Some people may feel that if
people are in prison and they are suffering from these diseases then they
can be cured when they are in prison. This is a fallacy. What we have out
there is what we have in prison. So they should be cured there first, then
they can be cured in prison. So we need to talk about that very frankly.
Again, in response to what hon Mr Fihla said, yes, I did thank the various
organisations within our community, the NGOs and many others in business
who have assisted us in our work. I heard him also mention the Centre for
Conflict Resolution. I have not mentioned any NGOs by name, but there are
many other NGOs which are assisting us.

However, what I would like to see happening is the co-ordination of efforts
in all the provinces. It serves no purpose to have ad hoc interventions. We
should co-ordinate all these efforts in various provinces. I think in that
way we would be effective in dealing with these questions of Correctional
Services, whether it is rehabilitation, training or overcrowding.

In response to the hon Mr Smit, who also touched on overcrowding and
corruption, I think we are constantly confronting this question of
corruption in Correctional Services. I think we are possibly also the
victims of our own transparency. But I believe that is one way of dealing
with this question of corruption and we will continue to do that until
members say to us: ``Yes, you are running a clean department''. We do
listen to what members are saying, but I am saying, yes, we are confronting
all those issues.

Yes, hon Mr Smit, the morale of our staff is quite low, if some of those in
the ranks receive only slightly more than R3 500 per month for doing the
kind of job they are doing. Yes, that should cause the morale to be low.
Some of them receive only slightly more than R4 000 a month. That would
make one's morale low.

In this respect I have also had discussions with the acting commissioner to
start negotiations with the Treasury to look at increments for our own
staff. I think the others in other departments, for instance the police,
have received increments and I am wondering why our own staff do not
receive increments. We need to negotiate that. It is not a question of
somebody not wanting to. I think it is a question of negotiations and I
have instructed the acting commissioner to begin that, because it is long
overdue.

To hon Mrs Seaton, yes, I agree that although the budget reflects an
increase of 8,8%, it is not adequate. We still need some more. I also thank
her for saying loudly that she is making an appeal to the Ministry of
Finance to assist us in this regard.

Ntate Diale is right, we have moved away from the harsh treatment of
prisoners. I think within the community we have people who are also
watching over us not to overstep this mark, that we should continue with
respect and recognition for human rights whether they are prisoners or not.
He is also right that in order to do some of our work effectively, we need
this social and economic support from outside prison. If we have trained a
prisoner and equipped him with skills, he will need support outside prison.
So we need the public support to enhance our programmes.

Ek wil vir Oom Bloem sê ons is besig met transformasie! [Tussenwerpsels.]
[Gelag.] Hy moet ons asseblief daarmee help! [I want to tell Oom Bloem that
we are engaged in transformation! [Interjections.] [Laughter.] He must
please help us with that!]

I think Mr Bloem is right, we are on track with transformation, hence our
theme of partnership with the community for prison reform. To hon member
Cupido ... [Interjections] ... I say that Correctional Services is one of
the fundamental arms of the criminal justice cluster. I think we all agree,
all other Ministers and Government agree, with that. Earlier she touched on
investigations. I am saying we are all aware of the investigations and
recommendations in those reports. We are dealing with those. It is not
going to be ``hey presto'' as if one pulls a rabbit out of a hat and
everything is okay. No, it is not going to be like that; it is going to be
a long process. We are dealing with that and the hon member can hold us to
that if we are not doing it.

(Translation of Sesotho paragraph follows.)

[Mr Tolo, with regard to the women in prisons, the pregnant ones that you
are talking about ... Is Mr Tolo here? Those pregnant women do get food.
The food they get is the kind of food we are told by a doctor that they
should eat, when they are in that condition. Therefore, they are being well
taken care of. When you do visit a prison and you see that they are not
being taken care of, it is your duty, sir, to tell me that some pregnant
women in a certain prison are not being taken care of and they do not get
the kind of food that they should be getting. However, I know that they
should be getting the correct kind of food, which is recommended by a
doctor. [Applause.]

Now, about those who have stolen meat and bread, Judge Fagan is talking to
magistrates and other judges out there, saying that those people who have
been jailed because they have stolen small things, should rather not be
jailed but should be sent out to work. Judge Fagan was telling me that he
was in the Bloemfontein area a few days ago, where he met a boy of about 14
years of age, in prison. He had been awaiting trial for about four months
already.

Now, when he asked the boy what he had done to be there, the boy told him
that he had stolen a mango. You know a mango, don't you?

HON MEMBERS: Yes.

The MINISTER: Yes. He had stolen a mango. Four months for stealing only a
mango.]

Yes, I agree with the hon Dr Mzimela, Mguni, that there is always an
argument against the privatisation of prisons, that once we do that, then,
in fact, we would be encouraging those who are in that business. Crime
would increase, so that criminals could also increase and the business
could flourish. Those are extreme arguments but those are the arguments of
people out there also. These kinds of structures would be customer based
and they would be market driven.

However, I also realise that there is an increase there because the hon
member also spoke about training and giving skills to people to effect this
rehabilitation. Although it is not adequate, there is an increase of 13% on
the personnel training budget, but, I agree, it is not sufficient to do
what we are supposed to be doing.

Yes, I agree with the hon member Ngaleka that we need to move away from
incarceration to rehabilitation. I have said it, and I agree that we should
provide skills and that we need public support and participation. I have
said that throughout my speech here.

Yes, we are also amending the parole system. The Parole Board is going to
change. I have announced it in this House and I am also going to announce
it in the NCOP. We are changing that.

To the hon member Swart, on overcrowding: Yes, I agree with him. The
implications there, especially when it comes to the development and health
of offenders, I think, are an impediment. So, our programmes are really not
running smoothly, because of overcrowding in some of our facilities.

To the hon member Dyani I can only say yes, because he has tasted the
bitterness of the prison confines.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, I have allowed
you to overrun your speaking time by about two and a half minutes. I think
the hon members have expended a great deal of energy here, and would like
to recharge their batteries.

The MINISTER: Mr Chairperson, I was looking at the hon member Nomatyala
there. I think lunch is ready. [Laughter.] [Applause.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Is that an invitation? [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Business suspended at 12:53 and resumed at 14:04.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 15 - Health:

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Madam Speaker, hon members, in a society as inequal
as our own, and particularly in one that is still deeply divided along
racial, gender and class lines, a critical measure of the success of
Government remains the degree to which it manages to narrow the gaps
between the rich and the poor. I want to state quite clearly that our
Government stands firmly for transformation to achieve social justice,
particularly through services like health that touch the lives of those who
are deprived, namely predominantly the African majority.
Over the past year we have made significant progress and registered some
clear successes in many critical areas of our work, but there are other
areas of delivery which are falling short of the results we seek.
Therefore, in accounting to this House for the proposed budget of over R6,6
billion, I intend to highlight problems and priorities that attest to our
commitment to improving the lives of the majority of our people. At the
same time I will raise some critical questions about the strategies we
pursue and where there is a need in some cases to review our approach.

During my address today I will focus on six aspects of health care
delivery: The quality of care that we provide in our hospitals and clinics;
our plan for the revitalisation of hospitals; the development of primary
health care services at local level; HIV/Aids, STD infections and
tuberculosis; our engagement in the international health arena; and,
finally, strategic interventions to protect those who obtain care in the
private sector.

Most of the people who use our public health services are poor. In
addition, many are unemployed and they live without adequate shelter,
nutrition or clean water. Their health is undermined by their social
circumstances and, at the same time, social development is retarded by
their ill health. Quality health care is critical in breaking this cycle.

What do we mean by quality care? I believe that there are three key
components to it. Firstly, it concerns the values and attitudes of health
workers, which encompass compassion, respect for human dignity and a
general orientation towards a human rights culture. Secondly, there is the
area of professional skills and critical competency. Here we are talking
about effective health care that achieves good clinical results. Thirdly,
there is the area of personnel management, including effective disciplinary
procedures.

In terms of providing quality of care, I believe that we have made some
major gains. We launched the National Patients' Rights Charter 18 months
ago and since then every province has promoted the charter widely in its
services. In addition, in order to promote a human rights ethos among
health care workers, each province has instituted several practical quality
of care initiatives. These include service excellence awards, hospital
accreditation systems, the revival of peer review committees, the
establishment of hospital boards and the strengthening of patient
information processes.

However, despite our efforts in this regard, I am aware that many patients
complain about the services that they receive in the public health system.
We get complains of patients lying in their soiled linen, health care
workers verbally abusing and intimidating patients, staff stealing
resources at the very time when our hospitals are struggling to make ends
meet, and health workers doing additional private work during their off-
duty hours and then giving very poor service in the public health sector
because they are exhausted.

I know that there are many health workers, professional and
nonprofessional, who do their work on a daily basis with skill, dedication
and compassion, often under the most difficult and challenging
circumstances. For this, they have to be commended. But, I would be failing
in my responsibility if I did not scrutinise the conduct of all health
workers and more especially that of the sub-culture where there are people
who are dishonest, callous and lazy. I also recognise the depth of the
problems that undermine quality care. In some instances resource
constraints are a factor and so is poor or ineffective management. But
these constraints cannot excuse fraud, abuse or negligence.

I believe that the most appropriate answer to this problem is the
consistent and unhesitating application of disciplinary measures against
offenders by the employers and relevant professional councils. We are
therefore embarking on a three-pronged approach within the public health
service. Firstly, we will expand our programme of promoting the Patients'
Rights Charter among both our health workers and people who use our
services. Secondly, we will institute measures to increase the
effectiveness of the management at hospitals and clinics and to upgrade
professional skills and practice. Thirdly, we will scrutinise the effective
use of existing disciplinary procedures and penalties for fraud, patient
abuse and professional negligence.

Beyond the public sector, we will look at the functioning of professional
councils. I have already met with them and I am pleased to say that they
have responded positively. They have committed themselves to a campaign to
educate people on their right to complain. This is a positive step but I do
not believe that it goes far enough. We have to ask ourselves whether the
professional councils are sufficiently independent to be impartial when it
comes to patient complaints. To this end I will appoint a task team to
assess the present legislation that governs the professional councils and
to advise me accordingly. I undertake to report back to this House on this
process during the coming months.

Secondly, the R3,27 billion which is granted to hospitals that serve as
national centres for highly specialised treatment will be looked into.
There is an urgent need to arrest the deterioration of our hospital stock.
However, there is little to be gained from the physical rehabilitation of
the buildings without paying equal attention to the quality of care that I
have been discussing and also more effective management. Through the
hospital revitalisation programme, we aim to address all these concerns in
an integrated and co-ordinated way.

Developing our management strength is a critical factor. Both the physical
renewal of hospitals and the improvement of service standards demand
skilled managers and appropriate management systems. Accordingly, we
invested R30 million last year to appoint chief financial officers and
senior support staff in our hospitals. A further amount of R79 million has
been earmarked to improve management efficiency in the coming year.

The third item that I would like to discuss is the district health system
and the consolidation of our gains in primary health care. The recent
cholera epidemic infected about 100 000 people in the past nine months and
caused more than 2 000 deaths, emphasising the critical link between
poverty, development and health. Excellent care by health workers helped to
keep the death rate down. Even so, the number of cholera cases continued to
grow. Through this we became aware that long-term answers lay not in health
care but in the provision of clean water and proper sanitation.

The way that we managed the cholera epidemic has been a strong vote of
confidence in the primary health care approach. It emphasised an
intersectoral approach to health. It also promoted community involvement
and located services close to the people. Since 1994, we have brought
health services within easier reach of about 6 million people by building
over 500 new clinics. During 2000, we turned our attention to the standard
of services provided by our clinics through a national survey that was done
by the Health Systems Trust. This highlighted areas of progress in our
clinics and also areas of concern.

Progress is reflected in the following: the availability of antenatal care
has improved substantially, the Dots approach to treating TB is widely
established, the ratio of patients to health workers has improved in nearly
all provinces, the proportion of clinics with electricity has gone up from
65% to 92%, and the supply of condoms, oral rehydration solutions, oral
contraceptives and certain drugs has also improved substantially.

On the negative side: essential tests, including tests for HIV/Aids and
syphilis, are not always available, essential equipment is still lacking in
some cases, many clinics are still without piped water and there has been a
decline in the availability of a few drugs.

A critical feature of primary health care, and a strong reason for locating
these services at the local level, is to create Government structures that
can be directly influenced by people living in the communities that they
serve. I would like to inform the House that I intend to address the formal
restructuring of primary health care services in my speech to the NCOP next
week.

When it comes to HIV/Aids, STDs and TB, I would like to point out today
that 5 June is a particularly significant date. It is exactly 20 years ago
today, on 5 June 1981, that the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta
published its historic report recognising Aids for the first time as a
distinct syndrome. When one considers the impact of HIV/Aids on the
continent of Africa, the destruction it has wrought on families,
communities and economies, it is astounding to think that the official age
of this medical condition is just 20 years.

We are privileged to have with us Dr Peter Piot who is visiting Parliament.
He heads UNAIDS. Dr Pyott has worked hard to promote the position that
HIV/Aids burden in Africa and Asia must be dealt with as a global
challenge. We welcome him to our country.

In the absence of a cure for Aids, prevention and appropriate management of
those infected and affected are fundamental. An effective response demands
that we tackle the hidden and overt prejudice against people living with
Aids.

Last month I had the opportunity of addressing the World Health Assembly on
behalf of the SADC region. I explained our approach to fighting HIV/Aids
through a complex set of interventions. Together, these form a
comprehensive multisectoral approach that is fundamental to success. The
interventions that we believe are key are the following: socioeconomic
upliftment, strengthening of health systems, strong preventive programmes,
robust and aggressive treatment of opportunistic infections, strong
mitigation programmes, and the targeted and appropriate use of anti-
retrovirals.

In terms of prevention, there are signs that safe sex messages are
beginning to bear fruit among the youth. A range of youth surveys show a
high awareness of HIV/Aids, good knowledge of prevention methods and even,
in some instances, reports of increased condom use. In addition, in the
past two years our antenatal surveys have shown a drop in HIV rates among
teenage mothers, a much less dramatic increase in the prevalence of HIV and
a sharp drop of 50% over three years in the syphilis rate.
During the past year we have also registered meaningful advances in
relation to treatment and care. We significantly expanded our facilities
for voluntary counselling and testing for HIV by using rapid test kits for
the first time. We developed and published guidelines on various aspects of
treatment and care. The response to these has been enormously positive.

We began to provide fluconazole to patients with fungal infections that are
associated with HIV/Aids. Fluconazole was previously beyond our budget
limits, but we negotiated a partnership agreement with Pfizer. In terms of
this, the company has donated a two-year supply worth R375 million to
public sector hospitals.

Our management of opportunistic infections is gradually improving as health
workers are trained to use the relevant guidelines. We follow the highly
effective syndromic approach to STD treatment in the public sector.
However, we believe that there is a need to make the sexual health services
a lot more patient-friendly. In addition, we are co-operating with private
practitioner groups to introduce syndromic treatment in that sector.

Tuberculosis is receiving particular attention. We have improved cure rates
to around 65%. We have successfully integrated HIV and TB management at
pilot sites. This has resulted in an increased uptake of HIV testing and
many HIV-positive patients are getting medication to prevent them from
developing active TB. We are now extending these pilot sites in all
provinces to at least one per health district.

During 2000 we commissioned an audit of TB hospitals, funded by the state
and run by Santa and Lifecare. We uncovered serious deficiencies in the
management of the Santa hospitals. As a result, the Health Minmec resolved
that the national department, in collaboration with the provinces, would
commission a forensic audit of Santa. Preparations for this audit have
commenced.

There is tremendous public interest in the nevirapine programme to prevent
mother-to-child transmission of HIV. We have invested considerable time and
energy preparing the research sites for this programme. The programme
involves much more than administering a dose of nevirapine to mother and
child. It has to be grounded in a research setting. It therefore involves
developing counselling services at the chosen sites; introducing rapid HIV
test methods; setting standards for the antenatal and postnatal care of the
mother; providing nutritional supplements to mother and child; ensuring
viable and safe infant feeding options; creating systems to collect data;
and developing mechanisms for follow-up on mother and child.

The 18 sites have been set up within a research framework precisely because
we want to answer several as yet unanswered questions. These relate to drug
resistance and toxicity. They also relate to the ability of HIV-positive
women to sustain safe infant feeding practices in a population where mixed
breast-feeding is the norm. The benefits of nevirapine are more likely to
be reversed where mothers mix breast milk with other foods. Furthermore, we
will also have to get to grips with the costs of these integrated and
comprehensive services.

In the final analysis, we will only claim that we have successfully
prevented mother-to-child transmission when we have prevented zero
conversion in the infant for two full years and sustained the mother in
reasonable health for that period. In this regard, I would like to mention
that we are at present awaiting the final two-year results of the SAINT
study into nevirapine that was partly funded by the national department.

With regard to the use of anti-retrovirals in triple therapy for the long-
term management of Aids, our position remains the same. We have no plans to
introduce the wholesale administration of these drugs in the public sector.
Anti-retrovirals are not a cure for HIV/Aids. In addition, we remain
concerned about aspects of toxicity, the availability of laboratory
services and infrastructural and educational constraints, particularly in
the rural areas. I would however like to assure this House that this
position is not ideological. Obviously, we will continue to explore all the
options available to us, including the provisions of our legislation and
the World Health Organisation and UNAIDS-sponsored negotiations with
pharmaceutical companies.

The biggest challenges in the year ahead will certainly relate to the
initiation of a national programme of community and home-based care. The
model for this has been drafted and it deals comprehensively with the
health, psychosocial and welfare needs of families affected by HIV/Aids.
Furthermore, it integrates the care of Aids orphans into the broad
community care approach.

None of us should underestimate the challenges of getting a programme of
community and home-based care off the ground. Each local care network is
unique and complex, and each needs strong co-ordination. We must find the
means to generate hundreds of these networks in a very short time.

Thinking of the task ahead from the vantage point of this historic day -
the 20th anniversary of the naming of Aids - my mind goes back to the early
1980s and the rise of the final round of mass resistance to apartheid. The
price was repression on an unforeseen scale, but that repression simply
generated new forms of organisation - the crisis committee, the parents
support committees and the advice offices. We created communities of
amazing care in the face of vicious repression. Fellow members, many of us
here were architects and builders of people's care structures. Let us renew
our commitment to the people of this country by taking up the Aids-care
challenge in a similar way.

The fifth item that I shall raise concerns South Africa's involvement in
the international health arena. At the heart of all our international
contact is our guiding principle of meeting the day-to-day needs of the
South African people. Our success in the recent Medicines Act court case is
still fresh in our minds, and I am sure this House needs little reminding
of the role that local and international solidarity played in this. I would
especially like to acknowledge the support of the ANC Women's League, our
labour movement and people living with Aids.

Less than a week ago we published, for comment, the regulations to the
Medicines Act that will enable us to implement the legislation that has
been delayed for three years. The regulations, like the Act itself, are
fully consistent with the international trade agreements to which we are
party. There will be a full three-month period for comment on the
regulations, and we look forward to robust engagement with all
stakeholders.

South Africa has also done extremely valuable work at the international
level in relation to tobacco control. We have made a strong contribution to
the drafting of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. We hosted the
African consultative meeting on this convention in March this year, where
representatives from across the continent developed a unified position on
international tobacco control. When the global meeting on the convention
took place in May, the coherence of Africa and the strong stand that Africa
was taking were clearly evident.

Here at home, the ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship is in full
force, and the control of smoking in public places is gaining ground. There
are, of course, some disturbing exceptions, and we will use the powers
vested in us by the Tobacco Control Act to deal decisively with them.

Perhaps our most valued work across national borders is the development of
health sector co-operation in the SADC region. Member countries have set
clear priorities for co-operation and, with regular contact, we have
developed durable joint positions on several critical issues. In
particular, we have adopted a common set of principles to guide our
responses to the discounted packages of Aids care. SADC health ministers,
as a group, will meet representatives of the major drug companies in
Pretoria on Friday this week.

The health sector is contributing actively to the development of the
Millennium African Recovery Programme, spearheaded by our own President and
the heads of state of Nigeria and Algeria. Our experience in relation to
TB, HIV/Aids and the issue of affordable medicines has been critical in
shaping our inputs to MARP. We successfully hosted the health ministers'
meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in Johannesburg in March. The
declaration produced by that meeting formed the basis for a resolution
tabled at a World Health Assembly in May.

Some of our most valued international exchanges are made not in
multinational fora but in terms of the professional work of generous and
skilled medical practitioners who come to South Africa from other
countries. Foreign doctors serving our people in terms of a number of
bilateral agreements make an invaluable contribution to health care in our
rural areas. For instance, we have a group of Tunisian doctors who have
organised a number of visits to our country to help reduce the backlog in
cataract surgery. A group of African-American medical practitioners, known
as the Zenzele doctors, has partnered with private South African
practitioners, and they too use vacations and spare time to take specialist
skills to outlying hospitals.

Finally, in relation to our international liaison, I would like to comment
briefly on the many bilateral arrangements that we have with a number of
countries that provide valuable technical assistance to us. It is my
intention, in the coming year, to focus on making the most of these
international partnerships in order to ensure that we derive the maximum
benefit.

My sixth and final area concerns our involvement in the private sector.
When it comes to private sector health care provision, Government continues
to play a critical role through legislation and policy development. When
the Medicines Act becomes effective, patients who pay for services out-of-
pocket and medical scheme members stand to benefit hugely and rapidly from
its provisions. As medicines become more affordable, the costs of health
care cover will be contained, members will get better value for the cover
that they buy and more people will be able to purchase health care.

The Medical Schemes Act that we passed two years ago is beginning to have
the desired impact. The Act not only outlaws exclusion from schemes on the
grounds of age or health status, but also guarantees minimum benefit
packages and attempts to protect members through prescribing minimum
reserve levels in the funds.

The Council for Medical Schemes administers the Act and, in a short period,
it has tackled its regulatory role with imagination, putting a high premium
on public education and effective responses to complaints. The council is
still partially funded by the Department of Health but it will, in future,
be financed through levies on medical scheme members. An amending Act will
be brought before this House, before the end of this year, to fine-tune the
principal Medical Schemes Act in line with the lessons we have learned in
the first two years since this ground-breaking law was passed.

I would like to highlight the fact that the relationship between the
Government and the private health care sector is not a one-way street. Take
the contributions of the Ophthalmological Society of South Africa. No fewer
than 300 ophthalmologists have pledged to contribute 60 000 free cataract
operations over the next five years to help eliminate cataract blindness.
[Applause.] Private sector patients will pay for their own hospital costs.
The Bureau for the Prevention of Blindness will sponsor low-income
patients.

In conclusion, I would like to end my speech with a reminder and an
announcement. The reminder is that the World Health Organisation has made
mental health its focal area for the year 2001. This is in recognition of
the fact that mental illness takes an enormous toll of countries, at all
levels of development. While mental illness might not feature clearly in
the mortality figures, the WHO estimates that it will be the biggest single
cause of disability in the world within 50 years. In the face of this, only
16% of countries devote more than 1% of their health spending to mental
health programmes.

South Africa does allocate more than 1% to mental health spending. This
year we will increase the allocated amount by reprioritising spending in
the national office. Furthermore, during this session we will table a new
mental health Bill, the first fundamental revision of the statutory
framework for mental health care in several decades.

The announcement concerns our intention to host a national health summit
later this year. The idea is to engage a wide range of experienced
individuals and critical interest groups in a constructive debate on the
direction of national health care. The health summit has been conceived in
the belief that strategic planning is a dynamic practice and that openness
to new influences enriches the process.

In closing, I would like to express my thanks, and I assure members that
they are not ritual thanks, but are sincerely felt. This is a rare
opportunity to thank all those committed health workers, throughout our
country, whose invaluable contribution to the nation is so seldom
recognised.

Throughout the year senior officials of the department and I have enjoyed a
constructive working relationship with both the portfolio committee and the
select committee, under the leadership of hon members Dr Abe Nkomo and Ms
Jacobus respectively. There has been a very helpful balance between
constructive criticism and support, and I say thank you.

On an ongoing basis, we sustain and build a productive and challenging
working relationship with our political colleagues, including the
President, the Deputy President, members of the Cabinet and the MECs of the
nine provinces. To them all I say, thank you very much.

I would also like to place on record my thanks to the chairpersons and
members - old and new - of the Medicines Control Council, the Medical
Research Council and the South African Institute for Medical Research.

Finally, my thanks go to the officials of the department, particularly the
director-general and the staff in the Ministry, who continue collectively
to support our efforts to provide a just, equitable and humane health
system for all South Africans. [Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I want to say that I am sorry that the
Minister is going to sit behind me, and that I would have preferred to look
at her when I speak. But, obviously, she is hiding and she has much to hide
about. [Interjections.]

The Ministry of Health, certainly this past year, has been shielded by the
court action over the price of medicines. It has managed to focus the
attention of politicians and the public alike on this one single factor in
the health care debate. But while this is admittedly an extremely important
subject and deserves attention, the hype around it has been so great that
most people have taken their eyes off the rest of the health debate.

So, while we have watched the antics of the Minister and her cohorts,
claiming a great victory over the pharmaceutical companies, the rest of the
health system in South Africa has continued to collapse because of lack of
initiatives and actions on the part of the Minister. Today the Minister has
claimed that she has had significant successes in the field of health care.
I think she needs to ask the people to whom her Government is administering
health care, because they, certainly, are not aware of her successes. Their
lives have not yet been touched by her successes at all. [Interjections.]

There are too many unresolved health care issues in this country for the
Minister to claim any victory. Perhaps the most important issue is that of
rural health, where the Government has claimed so much success. The truth
is that the health of the people living in those areas has not improved
because the Government has failed to develop a strategy to ensure that a
sustainable health care system for those people is in place.

A sustainable system will not revolve around the clinics that the Minister
claims to have built. She has bragged about this today, and her predecessor
bragged about it very often. But a sustainable system will revolve around
the personnel that she puts in place. If the health care workers, at all
levels, are not permanent, then the health care system is not permanent
either, and that is exactly what we have in the rural areas.
[Interjections.]
Our rural health care services are in a serious trouble because of people
like those members. [Interjections.] It is serious because very few of our
doctors, nurses and other personnel stay long enough to build up a service
to be proud of. They are too often employed on a temporary basis and at the
end of their contracts they leave for the cities or go overseas. The
department has got to do something to stop this. The long-term consequences
of this are dire.

In 1997, at an international health conference in Durban, the Durban
Declaration was drawn up and presented to the Ministry. [Interjections.] If
the hon member knew anything about health I would listen to him but he
knows nothing. In fact, I do not think he knows anything about anything.
[Laughter.] [Applause.] It dealt with this very issue of how to recruit,
train and encourage health care workers, doctors and nurses to work and
stay on a permanent basis in the rural areas.

The Minister has never ever responded to this declaration. Instead we are
faced, as ever, with a number of quick-fix solutions to the problems, like
the highly controversial employment of Cuban doctors and the system of
community service. But we all know that Cuban doctors are no long-term
solution. They were initially employed to fill a need, but there are
problems because they are from a foreign country. They speak a foreign
language and they have received specialist training and therefore have a
limited capacity to do the generalised work that is required of them in the
rural areas. They also go home after their contracts have expired. Their
scope of practice is limited, some are good and some are bad. The truth is
that, because of the highly political nature of their employment, it is
impossible to properly evaluate them.

The same applies to community service. It is nothing more than a quick-fix
solution to the problem and therefore has no sustainability. Yes, it does
get doctors into rural areas but there are no incentives to keep them
there. They stay for 10 or 11 months and move on, which means no
permanence.

We have a crisis in our nursing service as well. But here the Government
has proved that not only can it not keep nurses in the rural areas, it
cannot keep them in the cities either. Nurses are leaving the profession in
this country in droves and Madam Minister has been remarkably silent on
this. She has not even discussed this issue today.

The salaries paid to nurses are absolutely pathetic because the nurses, as
we all know - even Minister Tshwete would know this - are the backbone of
our health services and deserve a lot better. But it is not only the matter
of salaries that causes nurses to leave; their conditions of service
generally are poor. The number of patients they have to look after and the
state of equipment in hospitals leaves little incentive for these people to
stay.

We need to know from the Minister whether there is a comprehensive plan to
retain our own doctors, nurses and other health care personnel in South
Africa. If so, what is this plan? What does the department have to do to
recruit and retain doctors and nurses in rural and underserved areas? What
plan does it have to do this? We need answers to these rapidly. Time is
running out for our steadily collapsing health systems. The people in the
rural areas certainly deserve far more.

There is another matter of very serious concern. South Africa is burdened
with one of the highest TB epidemics in the world and the Minister has
claimed success in this regard today. How she could do that, I really and
truly do not understand. The national incidence in 1999 was 419 in 100 000,
which is more than double that of other developing countries and 60 times
higher than any rates in the USA or Europe.

The WHO has stated that there are 60 nations not taking the TB epidemic
seriously. Eight of these have enough money to do so but either fail to do
something or have left it too late, and, regrettably, South Africa is
listed as one of those countries. What an indictment of our health
services!

This country has for years relied on the services of the South African
National Tuberculosis Association. The Minister has spoken today about
Santa. It has a very fine history in its fight against TB. However, over
the past two years the fortunes of Santa have sagged dramatically. And
today it is an organisation all but destroyed, with many of the volunteers
and donors on which it so desperately depends seriously disillusioned.

During the course of the year 2000 the situation got so bad that eventually
a financial review of Santa was prepared for the Department of Health by
Hardy and Associates, which uncovered disturbing evidence suggesting that
the organisation operates as an unaccountable empire while absorbing
increased amounts of money intended for the poor and sick. It found that
the management committee headed by the CEO illegally absorbed large slices
of allocations from the Government intended for the betterment of hospitals
and community services, and that Santa head office had no documented
financial policies and procedures.
Much of this management was laid at the door of the CEO, who of course
responded in typical ANC fashion that it was all a case of racism and that
he was being targeted because he was black. We have heard that often
enough. That report was compiled in December 2000. What has the hon the
Minister done since then? It appears she has done nothing. Today she talks
of papers being drawn up for a forensic audit. Why has she waited for six
months before taking action on such a serious matter?

Tuberculosis operates in tandem with HIV/Aids, and TB's greatest scourge is
HIV/Aids of course. Elsewhere in the world, with hard work and the right
policies, TB has proved to be manageable. But the Health Ministry, through
lack of real initiative, has allowed it to escalate out of all control in
this country. I want the hon the Minister to explain to this House today
why she has allowed the situation with Santa to prevail and what steps her
Government is taking to curb the spread of TB in this country.

However, the picture of bad management on the part of her Ministry does not
end there. I want to know what she is doing about Fedsure health. She
talked about medical schemes today. Fedsure's merger with Northern Medical
Aid at the end of 1999 was a cause for serious concern and protest. But the
Registrar of Medical Schemes allowed it to take place on certain
conditions.

Since then two reports have been drawn up, one dated 12 April 2000, known
as the Watson Report, and the second, dated 20 September 2000, was headed
by the accounting and auditing from KPMG. Both reports were equally damning
on the state of both Northern Medical Aid and Fedsure health. It appears
that the merger should never ever have taken place.

The hon the Minister had been warned that Fedsure health was in financial
trouble and that it was probably in breach in many respects of the Act, yet
she has chosen to do nothing and the question must be asked: Why has she
chosen to do nothing? Why has no curator been appointed? Why has she not
acted on the reports drawn up for her department? It also seems that a case
of improper or disgraceful conduct may have been committed in terms of the
merger and subsequent developments in Fedsure. Why then, in terms of clause
16 of the Medical Schemes Act, has the matter not yet been referred to the
National Prosecuting Authority? Why is she failing to take action, leaving
so many people at risk? A bit generally, we have to ask: Why is she so slow
to take action when things are obviously wrong?

As long as this is her policy and her style of management we will never
develop a health care system in this country that we can truly be proud of.
[Applause.]

Dr A S NKOMO: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, Minister and the House, I
also recognise the health team of South Africa seated over here and all
over the gallery. We introduced this Vote by saying it was a budget about
the people, putting the people firmly at centre stage. We say it is a
budget about people who are not empty vessels into which a tablet or a
mixture is thrown by someone wearing a white clinical coat, nor torsos into
which needles are stuck impassionately by a functionary of the health
service.

The Vote on health takes place within the context of tumultuous change. It
happens against the backdrop of the historical and epoch-making, people-
driven victory over the pharmaceutical industry when the people of South
Africa and of the world made the giant bite the dust; it also happens
against the coming of age of local government; it happens when the
Integrated Rural Development and Urban Renewal Strategies of Government are
beginning to take shape; and it happens when there is greater co-operation
across the continent, as evidenced by the recent meetings of health
ministers in the region and in Burkino Faso on the continent and the
meeting of the first ladies of Sub-Saharan Africa in Rwanda.

It happens at a time when there have been various signals that the
international community will join hands in all manner of ways to combat the
HIV/Aids pandemic - witness the global fund, witness the launch of the
international partnership against Aids by Kofi Annan in Abuja and witness
the presence today in this House of Mr Peter Piyott of Unaids.

It is a time of great expectations, to which President Mbeki responds in
the following manner, and I quote:


  Whilst continuing to focus on the maintenance of the correct
  macroeconomic balances we have to pay attention to the critical
  microeconomic issues.

Given that presidential injunction, the portfolio committee convened 31
hours of budget hearings and invited the national Department of Health and
its chief directorates, as well as the provincial health departments, to
deal with the following matters. We focused on hospital services, the
problems and constraints thereof. We looked at the decentralisation of
primary health care, especially with reference to district health
authorities and how they link up to local government. That is why we
applaud the Municipal Structures Act, which gives greater authority to
local government to be able to have continuous borders with district health
authorities now.

We called upon the department to account for the extent to which they were
complementing Batho Pele in conjunction with the Patients' Charter. With
regard to the quality of service, we received numerous complaints of long
queues, in our position as public representatives and also as people who
are serving community-based constituency offices. During the budget
hearings we asked relevant questions that relate to what patients can
expect when they access health services, such as who directs patients to
receive the appropriate care and attention, and issues related to the gate-
keeping and shifting of patients.
Are counselling services available? Are reproductive services and family
planning available? Do hospitals and clinics have sufficient
pharmaceuticals available? Are patients told to come back the next day to
collect their medicines? Can they afford another taxi fare? Is there an
essential data list, and to what extent do hospitals and clinics relate to
communities? Do hospitals and clinics have governing structures in place?
Central to this equation is: Does care extend beyond the walls of the
hospital or the clinic?

In asking these questions, we are trying to get to the bottom of a critical
issue. Does care begin and end in hospital, or does it also extend to the
conditions under which the people live, the abject poverty which they
experience and how our health service is responding appropriately to that
issue? When that care is given, is he or she treated as an object into
which a tablet is thrown, or is this a compassionate event resonating with
the spirit of Dora Nginza and Cicilia Makiwane.

We have been trying to grapple with the issues related to the interface
between health care delivery systems and human beings. And that is why we
have put the Patients' Charter at centre stage to be a living document,
which is known by the people and health care providers and which must be
implemented to the letter and the spirit. These are the questions we have
asked at the hearings.

One of the pillars upon which the health service stands is the principle of
equity - that all shall be equal and have equal access to health care. We
were concerned, then, from our interaction with the submissions about the
extension of access and affordability for people in the farthest reaches of
our land who live in the far-flung districts, who are mostly women and
children. We noted, in this regard, the implementation of the integrated
nutrition programme, a programme which has had its ups and downs, but there
are glimpses of increasing engagement with the people.

Questions do arise, in this instance of the extent to which these
programmes make a difference in the lives of the people. Do they improve
the cognitive skills of the school-going children in the Valley of a
Thousand Hills? When the people access the nutrition programme and make it
their own, they breathe into it a new meaning. When they enlisted the
services of the Medical Research Council and the funding organisations from
the private sector, they did this to interrogate the very question of
whether the nutrition programme does make a difference, whether it is a
school attendance incentive or vehicle for the improvement of cognitive
skills of the learners. This does not happen everywhere, but it is a
solitary lesson that the people who present for health care are not just
empty vessels. It reminds us, as the rest of the world has known, about the
principles which were enunciated in 1978 at Alma-Ata about a people-driven
health service.

We have learned in the context of the cholera epidemic, amongst many other
things, the significance of community health workers, proving once again
that people are not empty vessels. It is in this context that we revisit
our policy on community health care workers and take this into account in
the budget-making process. But we also note the collaboration of different
Ministries and their departments that contributed to the enhancement of a
favourable result.

In this regard, we pay tribute to the various Ministries and departments
that have collaborated, for example Water Affairs, Local Government and
Defence. If the Department and the Ministry of Health alone had had to fork
out for this activity, they would not have managed on their budget. This
underscores how a limited budget can be made to achieve limitless
objectives. Yes, in so doing these departments have broken with the past of
discredited practices of fragmentation and of divisiveness.

We are aware of the Gauteng hospital commission of inquiry, which was led
by Maria Ranto. And we know that there are now mechanisms in place to
respond to the recommendations of that commission. We, therefore, need more
interaction with the Public Health Professions Council to make the
distribution of health workers more equitable. The question of whether we
are producing enough doctors is a matter we have addressed with the deans
of the medical schools. What we are suggesting to the Minister is the
establishment of a central admissions committee. We have suggested this on
a number of occasions.

A matter that cannot be left unmentioned is the question of traditional
healers. Last week we met with Prof Gumbi of the department, who reported
that the interim co-ordinating committee that has been established, on the
recommendation of the portfolio committee, is making steady progress. As we
begin to deal with the incorporation of traditional healers into the
biomedical system, we must also begin to look at the protection of
indigenous knowledge systems and also of indigenous intellectual property.

Last year the community health oversight hearings on the Choice on
Termination of Pregnancy recommended the work which has begun and which has
drawn the attention of the world. A month ago we received an international
delegation from Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Ethopia and the United States, which
looked at our legislation as a beacon for the rest of the world. In the
same vein the French and British invited us to share experiences, owing to
the work of the department in implementing the Choice on Termination of
Pregnancy Act. We received high acclaim for our approach to reproductive
health and gender-related aspects of health care. This budget has made it
possible for us to implement these services.

The Medical Schemes Act has thrown the searchlight onto the issue of public-
private partnerships and the extend to which private-sector patients can be
treated in the public-sector hospitals and vice versa. These are living
examples that these realities have imposed upon us. Interesting questions
are beginning to be raised by the Central Council for Medical Schemes and
the SA Health Review. It is a generally held view that telemedicine and
tele-education is for advanced societies and cities. But this is wrong
because in fact they are meant and are suitable for the rural areas where
people do not have access to transport, and so on.

May I then, in conclusion, refer to the whole question of this people-
driven health care delivery service that we are looking at. We stand today
in a world in which, emerging from the past, we have all these tremendous
imbalances. Therefore, we stand, as Britain stood in 1948 at the end of the
Second World War, when as an incipient and emerging society it had to begin
to understand and recognise that health care was not a commodity, but there
for everyone to receive. So we commend, at this stage, the envisaged piece
of legislation - the national health Bill - as the beginnings of a national
health service for South Africa. We commend this budget to this Parliament.
[Applause.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Madam Speaker, during the first millennium alchemists
tried to find the elixir of life. Now, in the second, biotechnologists are
attempting to create immortality. With the emergence of three technologies,
we are on the verge of a second creation: The genomes define the function
of every living organism's genes; genetic modification can cut and paste
genes from any living species to any other; and cloning can refashion cells
and culture them to produce a new creature. Humans have become God's
genesmiths. Never before in the history of science or medicine have we had
so much power or greater need for a clear ethical vision.

It is in this context that we must evaluate the Health budget, our approach
to Aids and TB, rising health costs, poor morale among doctors and nurses,
and diminishing services in hospitals and clinics. The IFP is concerned
about all of these weaknesses, but our approach to this budget is positive
health, like this gem of a book which we have all received. We will support
the budget.

The book's theme, like the IFP's, is the need to strike a balance between a
healthy body, healthy mind and a healthy spirit; and secondly, how adopting
the right approach with integrity and minimal expense makes a huge
difference to health. Confusion, secrecy and fear breed ill health. Humour,
hope and clarity of focus do the opposite. Our challenges are nowhere more
evident than in our handling of Aids. The total expenditure on Aids-
specific programmes is R296 million, disbursed through Education, Welfare
and Health. An amount of R125 million is for the integrated plan, of which
Health gets a mere R43 million, R9 million nationally and R34 million via
provincial conditional grants.

Provinces must fund their Aids management from their own budgets and
conditional grants, neither of which have been weighted to benefit the
provinces with the highest incidences of Aids. The money is earmarked for
life-skills training, voluntary counselling and testing, and home-based
care. But ring-fencing it makes it difficult to spend, and, owing to the
nature of conditional grants, almost impossible to track.

Policy and checks come from the national level. Business plans from
provincial programme managers must tie in with provincial spending.
Provincial CEO spending must be endorsed by the national and flow through
the Minmec forum on the basis of co-operative governance. The programmes
overlap various directorates and their implementation involves several
entities, such as clinics, hospitals, communication and medicine supplies.

The other R111 million in Aids funding is via the Government Aids Action
Plan, also mainly via conditional grants, for which there is little
information available. Evidently, most of it is for communication. Does the
House wonder that Dr Similela breaks down through frustration when accused,
publicly, of abandoning her wards? How can she climb a mountain when she is
trapped in a maze?

If the Health Department wants to be perceived as Florence Nightingale,
rather than the Grim Reaper, we cannot abandon provincial governments, as
the ANC sometimes suggests, for local governments have even less capacity,
and the problem would be compounded a thousandfold. We must simplify
Government and reduce duplication. Look at how well KwaZulu-Natal coped
with the cholera epidemic, when it was left to manage its own policy and
funds.

It is of little value blaming the past, pharmaceuticals or the media for
our lack of clarity, but without it and without adequate human capacity,
even the cheapest Aids medication will be of little use. Let us start
somewhere and designate those who must receive treatment with drugs: Raped
women, children, pregnant women and nursing mothers.

If we cannot afford more treatment, the IFP repeats its call for more
knowledge. People who test negative know they have a second chance. Those
who test positive are less likely to infect others. For this, we need more
funds and greater political will. At present, less than 40% of clinics
provide testing, and those who do are slowed by one-on-one pre-test
counselling that could be done in groups.

These are the headlines that will bring messages of hope: ``Government
embarks on massive testing drive for infectious diseases, in partnership
with WHO and Unaids'', ``Government enters into partnership with
traditional healers at clinics and hospitals'', ``Government funds research
into traditional and complementary Aids treatment'', ``Government rolls out
nevirapine for pregnant women and cocktails for rape victims'',
``Government tenders for cheap Aids medicines and pharmaceutical companies
respond positively''.

All this, and more, recommended in this book, we can do, while we set up
private management of Government clinics and hospitals to improve
efficiency and infrastructure. We need to start looking beyond Aids and
thinking about biotechnology and the second creation. At the moment, the
gene revolution is way ahead of us, and we have not even decided on a
labelling system for genetically modified foods.

There are simpler ways to bring down the cost of health care, without
legislation that exposes us to counterfeit drugs. We must privatise the
entire chain of medical supplies, to cut back on theft and increase
competition in medicine sales.

Our medical schemes, under the new legislation, are costing more, serving
fewer and providing less. We need a social health insurance scheme, with a
basic package as an option, to a range of schemes and all workers
contributing to medical schemes. For the poor and unemployed, Government
must purchase privately managed care. As a huge competitor, it will bring
prices down.

Let me end by advocating less concern with equality than with equity,
efficiency and a progressive approach. If the system is failing, let us
change it. We are not victims. We need less talk, less bureaucracy, more
partnerships, more integrity and more positive action.
I also want to thank and congratulate all the members of the Health
Department for their sterling efforts and support in the face of terrible
odds. I recommend this booklet to hon members. It will empower them.

Dr B G MBULAWA-HANS: Madam Speaker, I come from the rural area of Cala in
the former Transkei. In that area there is one hospital, and that hospital
has never been without a doctor or nurses, since 1994. Before 1994, that
hospital was only manned by Roman Catholic nuns from Germany, who could
hardly understand English, let alone isiXhosa.

What I am trying to say is that those patients were being treated very well
and are treated very well, but we from Cala are not speaking from
statistical records or reading statistics. We experienced the new
dispensation. [Applause.]

The second thing I think I need to say is that before one produces a
doctor, one needs to admit students to medical school. Train those students
and they will come out as doctors. However, if one trains 80% white
students who want to remain in the comfort of the urban areas, then Cala
will never have doctors. [Applause.]
Let me remind the Democratic Alliance that 25 years ago, when people were
moved to Mitchells Plain, they did not have a community health centre, they
did not have a hospital and all they were given was a mental hospital.
[Applause.] Tell me then, what does it mean, if a whole community with so
many people is given Lentegeur as a primary health care centre?

One of the challenges of introducing a district health system is to ensure
that all citizens of South Africa have universal and equitable access to
health care services, in every corner of the country, whether they are in
the Northern Province, in Mpumalanga or in Cape Town.

By 1999, the country was divided into 45 health regions and 174 health
districts. All health districts had to be demarcated, in line with the
proposals of the Demarcation Board. The transformation of local government,
the completion of the municipal demarcation process and the elections of 5
December 2000, have ushered in the opportunity to restructure the delivery
of health and other basic services. This will lead to the redemarcation of
these districts, and then these districts will share the same boundaries
with the newly demarcated municipalities.
The policy decision then, to decentralise the delivery of primary health
care services to local government, has been welcomed. This will also
address the duplication and fragmentation of services that we have
inherited from the previous regime.

Services under the apartheid government, of course, were short-sighted and
prejudiced, through planning the health services along racial lines. The
Municipal Systems Act provides clear guidelines to formalise community
participation structures by municipalities.

Kufuneka siyazi into yokuba uthi lo Rhulumente uphetheyo, we- ANC, abantu
baya kulawula. Indlela ekufuneka impilo yabantu ilawulwe ngayo kufuneka
ivele kubo, hayi kubantu abafunda iincwadi. Kufuneka kutsho bona ngokwabo
ukuba ziziphi na iimfuno zabo nokuba mabaphatheke njani na. (Translation of
Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[We must know that the ANC-led Government says that the people shall
govern. How people's lives should be governed, should come from them, and
not from intellectuals. They themselves should say what their needs are and
how they should be governed.]
Of course, we, as the ANC-led Government, are not saying that this process
is without problems. No, we need to plan and we need to manage the process
properly. Local government will have to be capacitated, and given all the
necessary support, in order to deliver these services.

However, let me remind the House that from 10 October to 31 October there
will be a census, and some of those people who will be against that census
will be from the DA. [Applause.] I want to invite everybody, all of the
people sitting out there ...

... bonke, bona, abantu abahleli emakhaya bayazi into yokuba kufuneka
babalwe. Bayazi bona ukuba bangaphi abantu, ekhaya. Ke, uthi uRhulumente we-
ANC ufuna ukubabala khon' ukuze acebe ukuba iinkonzo zonyango kubo mazime
ngaluphi na uhlobo. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[... people at home know that the census should be conducted. It is they
who know how many people they are in a homestead; how many others they
should provide for. The ANC-led Government wants to count them so that it
could plan its health system.]

Therefore, I want to encourage all of the people, at home and everywhere,
that they must be counted from 10 October to 31 October. However, let me
also put a challenge to the MPs sitting here, on all sides, that their
constituencies depend upon them for information about the census. If they
want to be part of this moving bandwagon of the ANC, they must jump on now,
otherwise they will be left behind. [Applause.]

In this process of rationalisation, all stakeholders must be involved, that
is, the Department of Health, to which we have listened very carefully
today, and the Department of Provincial and Local Government. Also, we must
not leave Labour behind, because the workers, who Mr Ellis says are moving
overseas to be comfortable, need to be taken on board in the consultation
process, which is exactly what the ANC Government is doing.

Bring the workers on board so that they know what is going to happen,
because when it comes to labour, the same people who are saying the nurses
are moving away in droves are actually against the labour movement. We do
not understand that because they are actually creating confusion among
those people outside. [Applause.]
I think we need to give clear examples of how the district councils work. I
will give two examples from the Eastern Cape, the first from a rural
setting, the Fort Beaufort district council, where Mrs Nyaba is the
district manager. This district council has shown clearly that if one
commits and makes the community participate, one will have a 90% success
rate. The cure rate is high, the interaction rate is low, so the
involvement of our community has changed the TB situation in that area. So
community participation is the key. [Interjections.]

If one takes the new Nelson Mandela metropole in Port Elizabeth, which has
been the first municipality to adopt an intersectoral approach to the
formation of local Aids councils, one sees that municipality is moving,
because we have taken the situation back to the people. The Department of
Education in that area is moving, because the people participate. I think
we must say to this Government and the Minister of Health that what they
are doing is right. In Xhosa we say ...

Imoto engahambiyo ichanyelwa zizinja ukuze ehambayo ikhonkothwe zizinja.
[People will throw stones at an active person, while they do not care at
all if one is idle.] [Applause.]

Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, today I would like to address the problems
facing health care workers in South Africa and, more particularly, the
problems facing doctors - those are both white and black doctors.

Any student interested in studying medicine has to pass a rigorous
selection process. In fact, it is so rigorous and competitive that we know
of cases where students with six distinctions in matric have not been
accepted. If selected, they go through a demanding six-year course of full-
time study and this is followed by one year of internship, followed by
another year of compulsory community service. After completing all of this,
they have a choice of either working at a state hospital or going into
private practice, or perhaps specialising.

The fourth option, of course, is to leave the country. We will discuss that
a bit later. Let us examine the circumstances in a state hospital. In any
state hospital it is more often than not true that they will be faced by a
tremendous workload. To put it bluntly, they will be overworked and
underpaid. They will also have to cope with the very low morale of health
workers in general, and more specifically the nursing staff. In this regard
I must say that the nursing staff have all my sympathy, for whatever goes
wrong in a hospital, it is always the nurses' problem. Whether it be the
air-conditioner or the lost file, the nurses always have to explain.

They are also required to work a certain amount of overtime, which
certainly falls outside the Labour Relations Act, and they have no recourse
to strike or industrial action. They are confronted by a lack of, or
seriously defective, equipment. In most cases their problems are compounded
by a serious lack of senior oversight, for most senior posts are unfilled
or frozen.

In many areas several hospitals have been closed, which led to a
significant increase in patient load in the hospitals that are left over.
In some instances, a hospital has to do the work of three hospitals and
that with an already depleted staff. Add to this the load of accidents,
especially motor vehicle accidents, trauma, specifically bullet wounds, and
lastly, but definitely not least, HIV/Aids. In fact, 50% of all admissions
to medical wards and 80% of all admissions to paediatric wards are Aids-
related.

Hospitals that have for many years delivered services in certain
disciplines, for instance orthopaedics, have had to close these units, and
patients have to be ferried between hospitals by ambulance. When one
examines the hospital budget, it is clear that provincial governments
expect hospitals to downgrade in the face of an increase in demand. The
only possible outcome of this scenario could be a reduction in the quality
of service, which is exactly what we are experiencing. The option of doing
private work has also been seriously curtailed.

The second option is to go into private practice. The doctor is now faced
with the very expensive prospect of setting up consulting rooms. He has to
look at expensive equipment, furniture, telephone and staff, of which the
minimum would be a receptionist, a professional nurse and a bookkeeper. He
must also consider computers and IT programs and, lastly, he must not
forget to pay his medical malpractice insurance. In certain disciplines,
this can be cripplingly expensive.

But let us assume that he has safely negotiated all these pitfalls and is
now ready to work. He will very soon find out that he is at the mercy of
medical schemes, of which there are well over a hundred in this country. He
will find that he is responsible for all the administation on the medical
scheme's behalf to deliver a successful account, remembering that every
single scheme wants an account delivered in a very specific and peculiar
manner. He now starts waiting for his money, but all he receives is mostly
excuses why he has not been paid, that is, if the medical aid scheme
bothers to communicate with him at all, as their contract is with the
patient and not with the doctor.

There must be at least a hundred reasons why medical schemes do not pay
service providers. It ranges from: The patient's ID was wrong; his date of
birth was wrong; the date of service was wrong; the code of the treatment
was wrong; the diagnosis was wrong; the patient is no longer on the medical
aid; to the patient has run out of funds or the claim is too late. And so
it carries on. The bottom line is: For at least 30% of the work that he has
done, he will never get paid.

Every so often the doctor must write lengthy letters at his own expense,
motivating why certain obvious treatments were necessary. If he dares to
charge the patient more than the so-called scale of benefits, the blackmail
kicks in that the medical scheme will directly pay the patient. In those
instances the doctor hardly ever sees any of the money, as the patient
normally spends it long before he realises he should have paid the doctor.

Patients seem to believe that, as long as they are on a medical scheme,
they have absolutely no obligation towards the doctor. After receiving some
of the payment, he realises with a shock that he still has to pay VAT of
14%, and at the end of the financial year, he also has to pay some tax. He
also finds out that the Road Accident Fund only pays after very long
delays, if at all. This lesson, however, is soon learnt and he then totally
shies away from doing any Road Accident Fund work.

He will very soon be faced with a subpoena for something that he has
allegedly done wrong. Complaints against health workers seem to be an ever-
increasing phenomenon. In the meantime, he has to keep himself up to date
with continued medical education, also known as continued professional
development. He will be horrified when he starts calculating what the
congresses cost and what every CME point costs him.

In the very near future his right to dispense will also be curtailed, even
if he runs a practice on the so-called package deal principle, where he
basically gives the medicine away for free. He shall have to do a course in
dispensing, have his premises inspected and apply for a certificate of
need. This certificate of need is of course based on a political decision
and he might even find that a few rand under the table will increase his
need considerably. The bottom line is that the poorer patient will suffer
even more, as they now have to pay the chemist the cost of the medicine
plus R25 per item for the professional dispensing fee. This will more than
double the cost of a visit to the private practitioner for a poor private
patient without a medical scheme.

The doctor will also very soon find out that criminals view doctors as soft
targets. He will be threatened, robbed, exposed to burglaries, hijacks,
and, in the worst cases, even murder. With a shock he will find out that
there is absolutely no comparison between what he is getting paid in South
Africa and what he could be earning overseas. It is therefore not strange
that more than a third of the doctors currently doing their community
service have indicated that they are going to leave the country after
completion of their community service. Many well-established medical
practices are finding it difficult to survive financially. They are also
considering leaving the country.

After what I have told members, it must be very clear that there is a third
option, and that is to leave the country. It is becoming more and more
attractive by the day. Why do we therefore find it strange that doctors are
leaving the country? After what I have told the House, the reasons must be
pretty obvious and clear.

It is up to this Government to rectify some of these anomalies and once
again make practising medicine as a health worker in South Africa more
attractive. If the Government fails to address these issues, I am afraid,
the brain drain of our doctors will increase at an ever-increasing pace, to
the detriment of the country as a whole. [Applause.]

Ms S K MNUMZANA: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President, hon members and
ladies and gentlemen, I have been tasked to talk about mental health.
Mental health refers to the total wellbeing of an individual, which
incorporates physical and psychological health as well as social
functioning. To provide a comprehensive service, it is critical to provide
elements that enable community members to maintain health stability, to
improve their productivity and maximise their potential.

Mental health problems are rated as the single largest health problem,
probably bigger than Aids and TB. Yet mental health is a very
underresourced area of care. Where services exist, they are in most areas
inaccessible, inappropriate and not comprehensive. According to the World
Health Organisation all people are susceptible to mental illness during
their life cycle, hence it is necessary for our country to provide support
systems to prevent mental illness and therapeutic interventions that are
appropriate within the cultural model.

paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to recall some things from the days when I was still growing
up. There was a hospital which was seen as a hospital for mad people, in
Bloemfontein, the Orange Hospital. I remember well, this hospital was on
the outskirts of town, and whenever people had to go there they were afraid
to enter the hospital yard, because the patients there were said to be mad,
and we knew mad people as people who attacked other people. We knew them as
people who killed other people.

However, all that has changed these days. Some women were also taken to the
mental hospital with pregnancy problems, and they were seen as mad people
by the community. Others died in the Orange Hospital because they were not
wanted by the community.]

Women suffer from mental health problems which result from domestic and
sexual violence, stress resulting from domestic and sexual violence, stress
associated with taking care of children, and the burden of unpaid labour
and second-class status in wage labour. In most societies, women appear to
suffer more from depression than men, especially those without support.
This awareness must be integrated into conceptualisation and implementation
of development programmes in all sectors and regions.

The dual objectives of integrating mental health care into general health
care and shifting many people from hospital to community care, which have
been pursued over the past few years, are to be continued. The policy has
met with mixed success. In some general hospitals and districts, mental
health is being provided as part of general health care, while in other
areas there are difficulties in changing to the new approach.
Significant movements have been made with respect to victim empowerment.
Violence surveillance has produced excellent results and will be expanded.
Pilot programmes on violence prevention and parent-child bonding both
produced important lessons which will be utilised as those projects are
expanded. This interventive strategy results in emotional stability, which
boosts mental wellbeing.

Let us touch on a few points regarding the transformation of mental health.
In the past, mental health promotion and services have been neglected.
Services have been fragmented and ill equipped, leaving them unable to
intervene effectively. Authors have stated in the South African Health
Review that these services were delivered within a framework characterised
by racial discrimination, paternalism and institutionalisation, together
with ineffectiveness and inappropriateness of services. These services were
largely also unavailable to the majority of the population, especially
people living in rural areas.

The 1997 White Paper of the Department of Health addressed this issue and
laid the foundation for a comprehensive and community-based approach to
mental health. This policy also promotes intersectoral liaising and co-
ordination of services at national, provincial, district and community
levels.

The Mental Health Care Bill, which should be approved by the Cabinet before
the end of 2001, seeks to address problems highlighted in the presentation.
It will replace the Mental Health Act, Act 18 of 1973. The focus of this
legislative framework is to make mental health services accessible to all
South Africans, to create the environment for treatment and to promote
intersectoral collaboration and community empowerment.

In conclusion, I would like to say the ANC supports our constitutional
approach which says that health is a right and therefore, as mental health
has been a cinderella, the ANC realised that the need for quality mental
health care included rural and disadvantaged areas.

The ANC's approach accommodates holistic models of care, hence there are
currently preventative and promotive programmes, but for sufferers curative
and rehabilitative health support is available, with consideration of human
rights as highlighted in the Patients' Rights Charter within the ambit of
Batho Pele principles.
To prove that the ANC is responsive, the WHO Mental Health Day was
celebrated at the Union Buildings on 7 April 2001. This year has been
marked as a Mental Health Year, as the hon the Minister has already stated.

[In conclusion, comrades, I would like to quote President Thabo Mbeki in
his speech, in the January Statement, when he said:


  The work done by our branches and members on the issue of Aids, and which
  must continue, has highlighted the importance of the question of the
  health of the masses of people and this must continue.

Therefore, it is important for the community to work for and together with
the Government, so that our people in the rural areas can be taught about
home-based care, so that people can welcome these sick people from mental
hospitals, because it is not all of them who are dangerous to the
community. This would help Government with the costs.

The ANC supports this Vote.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I recently heard a story about certain
politicians who prided themselves on the health and wellbeing of their
citizens. One day they decided that the water keeper who looked after the
water supply of the city way up the mountain as its source was dispensable.
They reasoned that because they never saw him and were not sure if he
actually did anything, they did not need him. They therefore decreed that
he was no longer to be acknowledged as the keeper of the water and thereby
stopped him from doing what he usually did, which was to ensure that the
water supply was not blocked or contaminated en route down the mountain to
the city.

For a short while, nothing changed. But soon the water became more and more
polluted, carrying diseases and destruction to the city. The politicians
debated many possible solutions. They poured chemicals into the water and
attempted to treat the many ailments of the people. This helped to some
degree but the problem could not be solved. One man kept insisting that if
the water keeper were put back in his rightful place, the problem would be
solved. There was no way they would even consider listening to the words of
this foolish prophet and they showed their irritation. This solution was of
course too simplistic for such proud politicians who were so wise in their
own eyes.

I want to inform the hon the Minister that it is her and my Father who say
if we listen carefully to the word of the Lord our God and do what is right
in His eyes, if we pay careful attention to His commands and decrees, He
will not bring disease on us. He says: ``I am the Lord your Healer.''

The Minister can work herself to the bone - I am sure she does - and can
consult every authority - again, I am sure she does - yet which one of us
can stop HIV/Aids, cholera, foot-and-mouth, malaria or any other plague if
God says differently? Democratic Alliance MEC Nic Koornhof is quoted in the
media as saying, ``Where HIV is in our schools, you need to have the best
preventative tool available, and that's condoms.'' It is glaringly obvious
that the war against HIV/Aids will only be won by a dramatic change in
sexual behaviour. Promoting condoms as the answer to the epidemic is a
blatant misrepresentation which has obscured the facts.

Statistics reveal that there are almost 15 failures per 100 sexual acts
protected by condoms, and yet we are expected to believe that the HI virus,
which is 450 times smaller than a sperm, can be magically blocked by a
condom. Researchers confirm that the publicity given to the condom has in
fact led to riskier sexual behaviour because of a false sense of security.
The only real prevention of Aids, which politicians believe too lofty a
goal for South Africans to achieve, is sexual abstinence before marriage
and faithfulness in marriage.

The hon the Minister should remember that our God promises to heal our
land, if we pray and turn from our wicked ways. He is a loving and
forgiving God, and will forgive this nation our sins - even the sin of
legalised abortion - if we turn and repent. To date we, as a nation who
voted for a Constitution which allowed for the callous murder of our unborn
children, and voted for politicians who we know supported the Choice of
Termination of Pregnancy Bill, have the blood of more than 150 000 unborn
babies on our hands. For this, we will face the wrath of God who created
each and every tiny baby in every detail with a specific plan and purpose
for their life.

Dear God, have mercy on us! Until this Government has the courage to admit
its errors, stops spending money on condoms and human slaughterhouses, and
puts in place policies which promote life and not death in South Africa,
the ACDP has no option but to vote against the Health budget. [Applause.]

Mrs N B GXOWA: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon members, I am not going to
start a debate on termination of pregnancy. We have passed that chapter and
we have forgotten about it. We have saved thousands and thousands of women
from backstreet abortions. [Applause.]

The ANC-led Government continues to shift resources to build up our new
society. This shift of resources remains an important vehicle for achieving
equity.

In our townships and informal settlements our people still know only rain,
whilst a privileged few enjoy sunshine. Recently, Dr Melanie Kraisin, a
clinical psychologist, experienced the rain first-hand when she visited the
Katorus informal settlement on the East Rand. Dr Melanie went into one of
the shacks, a home to a mother dying of Aids and her two young children.
She came out with tears streaming down her face. Why the tears? The
bedridden woman was asked if she could go to a clinic, if medicines were
available, and her reply was: ``Please, give me some food! Just a piece of
bread!'' That is what she wanted.

In a letter to me, Dr Melanie goes on to say:


  I, too, am guilty of criticising President Mbeki and Minister Tshabalala-
  Msimang for their stance on poverty and Aids. But no more. How can I,
  coming from a middle-class suburban home, really understand poverty, the
  abject misery that taints the lives of so many, a mere twenty minutes
  away from my home where it is considered a tragedy if one of my children
  spills Milo on the carpet?

Poverty is the single biggest cause of ill health, and no number of
clinics, doctors or nurses can compensate for its effects on people's
lives. The current redistributive strategy, which is also intersectoral in
its approach, is correct. But we have a long way to go.

A few areas that require more attention are the following. Firstly,
environmental issues deserve pre-eminence in our planning of programmes and
projects, especially when planning for environments of the poor. These
issues also tend to significantly increase the workload of women. Secondly,
water and sanitation in both rural and urban areas remain a concern, as
badly provided and maintained sanitation systems could create more of a
health hazard. Thirdly, waste removal systems in underserved areas are
inadequate, causing environmental degradation. Lastly, waste landfills are
generally situated very close to marginalised communities, creating health
risks.

Last year we read about numerous incidents in the Western Cape and Gauteng
where medical waste became a major health threat, especially to children.
We need urgent guidelines for the management of chemicals and health care
waste. The initiatives by the Departments of Health and Environmental
Affairs which identified how waste should be managed are welcomed.

The ANC-led Government has introduced a bold plan to discourage tobacco use
through public education, support for smoking cessation programmes and
legislation. Steep tax increases have reduced cigarette consumption, and
increased Government excise revenues. The Department of Health must be
congratulated for these efforts.

New data has shown that smoking causes death from TB, as well as from lung
cancer. Smoking increases the risk of dying from TB by 60%. These findings
are worrying and we, as public representatives, should make every effort to
discourage smoking in our environment.

I have kept a subject that is very dear to my heart for last. That is the
issue of home-based care. The impact of the HIV/Aids epidemic on health
services, families and communities is emerging at a rapid, head-spinning
pace. Home-based care has become a national policy priority - men and women
in our communities, who are working tirelessly and without remuneration,
must be saluted for their dedication and commitment.

As an active participant in the church and women's organisations, I have
gained first-hand knowledge of the magnitude of the crisis we face and the
challenges ahead. A feature of the home-based care projects in my area is
the high turnover that NGOs and organisations face because it is difficult
to get people to commit themselves without any incentives. But we can
initiate nonfinancial incentives through creating a sense of belonging, a
supportive working environment, training to gain skills and so on.

I have also come to see how important the development of partnerships with
service and care agencies are to the success of home-based programmes.
Intersectoral relationships such as those between clinics, hospitals and
welfare agencies are critical to facilitate easier admissions to hospitals,
access to prescriptions and medications, and the provision of food parcels,
transport and other services to the ill.
Unfortunately there has been a lack of standardisation regarding the
training and the quality of services. This is an area that I believe the
department is working on. This is the perfect opportunity for us to
mobilise support and activism in our communities - to deal not only with
the scourge of HIV/Aids but with the broader issues related to poverty.

I have come across many old and sickly people who have no family for
support and no food. They are just lying in their homes waiting to die.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, om 'n volledige gesondheidstelsel en 'n
infrastruktuur in 'n ontwikkelende land te vestig, is baie moeilik. Kyk
maar na die vlak van gesondheidsdienste in Afrikalande om hierdie probleem
te kan verstaan. Om so 'n gesondheidstelsel te vestig terwyl 'n mens in die
middel van 'n pandemie van Vigs is, soos by ons, is bykans onmoontlik. Dit
is die taak van hierdie departement en van hierdie Minister.

Amper 75% van alle mense in die wêreld met Vigs woon in Afrika. Die siekte
het reeds 12 miljoen kinders in Afrika wees gelaat. Dit is nie net 'n
siekte van swartmense soos baie mense glo nie. Suid-Afrikaanse blankes het
'n 20 maal hoër besmettingskoers as enige ander blanke groep in die wêreld.
Dertien persent van Suid-Afrika se arbeidsmag is byvoorbeeld MIV-positief.
So kan ek voortgaan met syfer na syfer.

Ek het nie tyd om die argumente van President Mbeki oor Vigs en armoede
volledig te argumenteer nie. Ek sou graag wou. Ek dink dat dit algemeen
aanvaar word dat daardie debat groot verwarring veroorsaak het, en baie van
die departement se veldtogte baie minder effektief gemaak het. Ek hoop ons
het daardie verwarrende uitspraak oor die oorsake van Vigs nou permanent
agter ons gelaat sodat ons die saak kan aanpak.

'n Tweede punt is dat prof Rachel Gumbi, 'n direkteur in die Departement
van Gesondheid, sê die Universiteit van die Vrystaat en die Universiteit
van Stellenbosch, met hul Afrikaanse taalbeleid, swart studente mediese
opleiding ontsê. Haar feite is verkeerd. Ek ken albei hierdie
universiteite. By die Vrystaatse Universiteit word die volledige mediese
kursus byvoorbeeld ook in Engels aangebied.

As dit oor taal gaan, is haar argument nie logies nie. Hierdie selfde
departement stuur mediese studente na Kuba. Die arme studente moet daar in
Spaans studeer om medies te kan vorder. Hiermee het die departement geen
probleme nie, wél met Afrikaans. Is die direkteur se uitlatings dan nie net
bedoel eintlik om 'n aanslag teen Afrikaans te wees nie, of waaroor gaan
dit?

Ek nooi haar uit om saam met my hierdie universiteite te gaan besoek om te
sien hoeveel moeite, tot Afrikaans se nadeel sover dit my betref, by hulle
gedoen word om studente opleiding in Engels te gee. Waarom sit ons nie
bietjie druk op die Universiteit van Kaapstad om meer moeite te doen om sy
mediese fakulteit toeganklik vir Afrikaanse studente te maak nie, siende
dat die Universiteit van Kaapstad in 'n provinsie geleë is waar 62% van die
mense Afrikaans praat? (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, to establish a complete health care system
and infrastructure in a developing country is extremely difficult. One just
has to look at the level of health services in African countries to
understand this problem. Establishing such a health care system while one
is in the throes of the Aids pandemic, as is the case here, is virtually
impossible. This is the task of this department and of this Minister.

Almost 75% of all people in the world suffering from Aids live in Africa.
The disease has already orphaned 12 million children in Africa. It is not a
disease that only black people suffer from, as many people believe. South
African whites have a 20% higher infection rate than any other white group
in the world. Thirteen per cent of South Africa's labour force is HIV
positive, for example. I can continue to mention figure after figure in
this regard.

I do not have the time fully to debate President Mbeki's arguments
concerning Aids and poverty. I would have liked to do so. I think it is
generally accepted that that debate caused large-scale confusion, and
rendered many of the department's campaigns far less effective. I hope that
we have permanently left behind that confusing statement in respect of the
causes of Aids so that we can tackle the matter.

A second point is that Prof Rachel Gumbi, a director in the Department of
Health, says that the University of the Free State and the University of
Stellenbosch, with their Afrikaans language policy, are denying black
students medical training. Her facts are incorrect. I know both these
universities. At the University of the Free State the entire medical
course, for example, is also presented in English.

If this concerns language, then her argument is illogical. This very same
department sends medical students to Cuba. There the poor students have to
study in Spanish to make progress in medicine. The department has no
problems with this, but they do with Afrikaans. Are the director's
statements actually intended as an onslaught against Afrikaans, or what is
this about?

I invite her to visit these universities with me to see how much trouble
they are going to, to the detriment of Afrikaans in my view, in order to
train students in English. Why do we not exert more pressure on the
University of Cape Town to make its medical faculty accessible to Afrikaans
students, since that the University of Cape Town is situated in a province
in which 62% of the people speak Afrikaans?]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, this debate could not have come at a more
appropriate time than the present.

In previous Health Vote debates we got ourselves entangled in academic
debates about the causes of HIV/Aids. Now HIV/Aids is hitting us. It is
hitting the African states and the Third World countries with a vengeance.
It is estimated that 15 million people have died of HIV/Aids in Africa, and
about 3 million are infected with the disease in South Africa.

Nkosi Johnson bravely put a face to HIV/Aids, and his death has vividly
depicted our pathetic and helpless situation. How can we go to sleep at
night when the flowers of our nation are being wiped off the face of the
earth?

Looking back, it is totally inconceivable that we could have wasted so much
of our precious and valuable time arguing about Aids. Last week, the
Portfolio Committee on Health visited some clinics in Gugulethu and
Khayelitsha. There we saw large numbers of people suffering from mostly
curable and preventable diseases. My heart sank. Elsewhere in South Africa
and in the world, particularly in the rich northern hemisphere, such
situations do not and cannot obtain.

However, in this sea of gloom was an island of hope, the HIV/Aids clinic.
Mother-to-child transmission is being tackled head-on, and Aids victims
receive loving care. The cry and appeal from workers was simple: ``Give us
more money and help so that more people can be reached''. We must get our
priorities on spending right. The saying that goes ``The rich must live
more simply so that the poor can simply live'', bears repetition.

I want to commend, as I did in an earlier debate, the department for
winning the case for cheaper drugs. It is a real shame that the cost of
living is high, the cost of health is high and the cost of dying is also
very high.

I also wish to commend the department for helping to contain the cholera
epidemic, which is another affliction upon the poor, and another curable
and preventable ailment. The use of chlorine and Jik saved our nation. One
person said, rather cryptically, Jik stands for ``Jesus is King'', which is
a clear reference to the power of God to purify all impurities in our
society.
We need to teach our people that they can look after themselves and survive
most afflictions. Churches, of which I am part, must stop teaching people
that when they die of preventable diseases, or even die at the hands of a
wicked murderer, ``it is the will of God''. The will of God is demonstrated
when people have life and have it in abundance.

This is what this debate is about - to devise ways and means of bringing a
fuller and better life to all our people.

Mrs M M MALUMISE: Madam Speaker, indeed, Jesus is King. [Laughter.] This
budget shows the commitment of the ANC to honouring its pledges and
bringing about economic empowerment and social development for all South
Africans.

Today, I want to examine issues related to TB and infectious diseases like
malaria. Despite sustained progress, since the formulation of the new
policy guidelines in 1996, TB remains a major public health threat in South
Africa, and this does not exclude the Western Cape. [Applause.]

The effects of the rapidly spreading HIV epidemic further compounds the
prominence of the TB epidemic and the proportion of TB patients co-infected
with HIV is increasing. We must speed up the integrated management of these
two epidemics in the Western Cape. [Interjections.] The promotion of
voluntary counselling and testing for HIV and TB at treatment centres, the
provision of materials for advocacy and health education for TB, HIV and
Aids, and the development of training and management guidelines for dually
infected patients will go a long way towards achieving this goal.

Since the introduction of the combination of anti-TB drugs in 1999, there
is increased adherence to treatment and reduction in the drug-resistant TB.
But we must further the progress already made in delivering directly
observed supervised treatment to TB patients, particularly within the
context of community-based care. Improvements in the computerised recording
systems will further assist in more accurate documentation of the TB burden
and consequently lead to targeted interventions and increased budgets.

The Department of Health's efforts to contain the epidemic in the country
over the past five years have been notable, but there are areas that still
require sustained attention. A further increase in the provision of the
Directly Observed Treatment System for TB patients and the development of
accurate methods to monitor this should be undertaken.

The Directly Observed Treatment System, Dots, should be fully functional at
primary health care and community level. This should be evident from
improved cure rates if management of dually infected HIV and TB patients
are to be effected.

[Ellis, the health care workers and others in that department, as well as
the community organisations, have to teach communities to prepare for and
support the expansion of community care services, in the cure of TB. If
this does not happen, there will be a problem with the inception of care
for TB, HIV and Aids sufferers in the community. It will be seen as one of
the burdens placed on the shoulders of community volunteers, without their
being paid.]

Mr M J ELLIS: It is nonsense.

Mrs M M MALUMISE: It is true. The hon member did not understand what I was
saying. [Interjections.]

Experience is showing us that even on a global scale TB does not attract as
much attention and sociopolitical mileage as HIV. That is why the
opposition never talks about it. It is not sexy enough or headline-
grabbing. It is no good.

Linking the management of TB and HIV can go a long way towards channelling
funds to efforts aimed at combating TB. Regional partnerships should be
encouraged to strengthen cross-border support in combating the dual
epidemic as well as the standardisation of control strategies. We are
talking here about boundaries such as those between South Africa and
Mozambique and Swaziland. [Interjections.]

We are seeing increased multidrug-resistant TB, which is expensive to
treat. Every effort must be made to ensure improved compliance with anti-TB
... [Interjections.] ... Will the hon Ellis shut up and listen to what I am
saying? Every effort must be made to ensure improved compliance with anti-
tuberculosis medication, through effective patient treatment support
systems and the provision of combination drugs.

One of the issues that the committee discussed during the hearings was the
role of Santa and its role in the future. We are aware of the difficulties
that have beset the organisation. [Interjections.] We welcome the review of
Santa and we hope that the Minister will act upon the recommendations of
the review.

Last year was a watershed year in terms of recognising the serious effect
malaria has on African economies and communities. Last year the Abuja
Declaration on Roll Back Malaria in Africa was initiated by African
leaders. Malaria is becoming a barrier to development and the alleviation
of poverty in Africa.

South Africa is unfortunately not exempted from the potential ravages of
malaria, which affects three northeastern provinces, ie KwaZulu-Natal,
Mpumalanga and the Northern Province that are particularly vulnerable.
There is no single formula for malaria control in this country. There are
provincial differences in both the management and control of research
priorities in order to suit local conditions at provincial level.

Efforts to overcome the escalating problem have involved a wide range of
activities. To keep pace with drug efficacy, drug policy has been updated
repeatedly. I want to tell Mr Modisenyane that insecticide usage has been
changed recently in an attempt to eliminate the dangerous malaria vector
``funestus''. The wider implementation of insecticide-treated bednets is
under discussion. A major regional effort, the Limpopo Special Development
Initiative, is under way and better malaria reporting and information
systems have been introduced.

Analysis of malaria trends indicate a spread to lower-risk areas, but there
is no reason to believe that malaria cannot again be controlled by the
effective use of appropriate insecticides and effective drugs. Although
aspects of malaria control have been decentralised to the district level,
for example diagnosis and case management, there is a need to retain a core
of well-trained and experienced malaria control experts at both provincial
and national levels.

I want to urge the Minister and the MECs of affected provinces to pay
further attention to the continuous monitoring and evaluation of the
malaria vector control programme and its efficacy, encourage the ongoing
surveillance network to monitor both drug and insecticide resistance for
evidence-based decision-making policy, invest resources into the effects of
malaria on the development of communities, the business industry and
tourism, and to increase capacity development at both national and
provincial levels.

The ANC has taken the lead in introducing programmes which have brought
real improvement to the lives of ordinary people. We can be proud of our
record of the past five years. We support this budget. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker and Minister, the main aim of the Department
of Health is to promote the health of all people of South Africa through a
caring and effective national health system, based on the primary health
care approach which is also in keeping with the White Paper on the
transformation of the health system.

The MF finds it commendable that the department hopes to implement the
aforementioned activities through three organisational programmes, namely
administration, strategic health programmes, and external and priority
service delivery health programmes. [Interjections.]

In contradiction to the sharp increase of the budget for health for 1998-
99, the MF is not content with the 2000-01 decreased allocation to the
budget. However, it has been agreed that the negative real growth in the
budget can be partly ascribed to the completion of some construction
projects such as the Nkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital in Durban and
the Nelson Mandela Hospital in Umtata.

The MF compliments the Department of Health on its substantial progress in
the establishment of the National Health Laboratory Service, the national
plan framework, several developments in HIV and Aids strategic planning, as
well as developments in human resource initiatives.

However, a significant decrease has been seen in the amount allocated to
the district health system. There is a need for issues to be clarified in
terms of how the recent local government demarcation could affect interim
health districts and presumably impact on service delivery, and the overall
outcomes of the subprogramme still need to be clarified.

The MF believes that it is important for effective communication to occur
between the Department of Health, provincial and local government as well
as the Demarcation Board in order to define and, where necessary, integrate
pragmatic functions. The MF welcomes the significant increase for the
international health liaison which forms part of the strategic health
programme.

However, there has been an insufficient increase in the amount allocated
especially to SADC activities in the 2001-2002 budget. Therefore, the MF
finds it necessary to ascertain which specific programmes will be
implemented and to enquire whether adequate provision has been made to
cover expenditure for all activities planned by the department.

The MF is not content with the significant decrease, from R693 777 million
in 2000-2001 to R614 177 million this year, in the nutrition programme,
which includes the primary school nutrition programme and income-generating
programme financed by the poverty relief allocation.

Research has indicated that the poverty-stricken are more prone to health
risks such as TB, HIV and Aids. They also suffer respiratory infections
associated with indoor and outdoor air pollution caused by domestic use of
coal and wood for cooking and heat. On the other hand, the MF compliments
the Government on the much-needed allocation increase in the budget towards
the HIV/Aids and tuberculosis programmes.

The MF recommends increasing the funds allocated to the pharmaceutical
policy and planning subprogrammes so as to ensure that essential drugs are
available. The MF also compliments the Government on intending to give the
provinces permission to administer the drug nevirapine to HIV-positive
pregnant women to prevent them from passing on the virus to the babies. The
MF supports the Budget Vote for Health. [Applause.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker, hon members, in 1999 the Department of
Health's strategic framework identified a decrease in the incidence of
HIV/Aids as one of its key focus areas. [Interjections.] Sadly, it has
failed in this area. Prevention programmes have not had the impact that
were both hoped for and expected. This fact is borne out by the rate of new
infections, which is now estimated to be 2 000 per day compared to 500 ten
years ago. Millions of rands allocated to HIV/Aids in this country remain
unspent and it seems that the Government is not doing everything in its
power to help people currently affected or infected by the deadly virus.

During a debate held in the Cape legislature on 24 April this year, it
emerged that R31,9 million of the national HIV/Aids allocation for 2000-01
was unspent. The Department of Health was given until early May to say how
it planned to spend it. Needless to say, details are not forthcoming.
Despite the Government's recent hollow victory over the pharmaceutical
industry, and promises made at the Aids 2000 conference, South Africa's 4,7
million people living with HIV/Aids are not any closer to getting access to
antiretroviral drugs which could suppress replication of the virus.

Last year, 250 000 South Africans died of Aids-related diseases. While it
was difficult for earlier predictions to capture the immense tragedy that
is unfolding, the human and social costs are most starkly illuminated in
the lives of millions of orphans left behind as a result of the epidemic.
It is estimated to date that approximately 150 000 children have been
orphaned as a direct result of the Aids pandemic. By 2005, some 1 million
children under the age of 15 will have lost at least one parent to the
disease and, by 2010, the number of Aids orphans will have increased to 2
million.

While the prospects for any orphaned child are not good at the best of
times, they look much worse when viewed in the context of the Aids
epidemic. The Government says that it is committed to fighting Aids through
education. Now while education may be seen to be one of the keys to
successful development, the Aids pandemic has the potential to adversely
affect the education sector in the sense that households with an infected
adult are less likely to educate their children because labour may be
required at home or because the household can no longer afford to carry any
of the costs of education such as those for fees, uniforms or books.
Simultaneously, the ability to supply education may be impaired.

Recent figures released by Sadtu put infection among active teachers at one
in 10. The reality is that the Department of Health has a limited capacity
to deal with this epidemic. The Minister must evaluate her poor track
record in contending with the epidemic. An analysis shows that there is no
coherent, comprehensive strategy. The DA would like the Minister to
consider her failures in respect of the epidemic. Instead of playing games
with people's lives, she must set up an Aids commission, headed by the
Deputy Minister, whose sole focus would be handling the pandemic.
[Interjections.] The solution to confront the pandemic is to base it on the
hypothesis that HIV/Aids is here to stay and we should treat it as if we
were at war.

The DA has been proactive in its response to the pandemic. We recently held
an intersectoral seminar at which our policy on HIV/Aids was presented.
Furthermore a proposal to establish an Aids desk for members and staff of
Parliament has been launched with the Secretary to Parliament. We have had
a self-righteous proclamation by the hon Mbulawa, to loud applause, about
how she knows first-hand about life in the rural areas. What she failed to
tell the House is that she practised her profession as a doctor in an urban
area. [Interjections.] No doubt some hon member will follow me shortly and
make jokes at the expense of the opposition parties and, as is typical, ANC
MPs will clap their hands and jump up and down. In reality the Government's
track record is no laughing matter.

In conclusion, South Africa has been standing still at the crossroads for
far too long. Aids is the biggest threat to development and peace in South
Africa. Choices made now will reverberate for generations to come. The DA
calls on the Government to stop using the pandemic as a political football.
[Applause.]

Ms A N LUTHULI: Madam Speaker, hon members, I do not know where the DP get
their statistics. [Interjections.] We are faced here with a disease,
HIV/Aids, in which many issues are at play, such as organisms,
socioeconomic conditions, including poverty and education, and, in general,
the living conditions of an individual.

Women are a major casualty in HIV/Aids progression and the reasons are poor
education and the anatomy of a woman, which is open and prone to cervical
tears and abrasions. If a woman has an STD, it is harder to diagnose this
disease than it is to do so in men, and therefore treatment may be too
late. Also women are marginalised in terms of their education and nutrition
and some end up as sex workers, making them even more vulnerable.

I want to applaud the department for the measures they have put in place to
protect sex workers and their initiatives on trucking routes. I want to
encourage NGOs such as Sweat, which has been actively working with sex
workers, providing counselling, education, condoms and so on. We know that
blacks are more affected by this disease, for the same reasons I have
mentioned in respect of women. But we also know that blacks were deprived
in the past, and it is that same sector which deprived them which says
blacks are affected more not because of poverty and deprivation, but
because they are promiscuous. This is a shame. [Applause.]

Allow me to briefly discuss the progress of the disease. In 1992 under 1%
of antenatal cases were HIV-positive, and the epidemic took hold first in
KwaZulu-Natal. Half of Central Africa and Southern Africa export via
Durban, so South Africa is a victim of its own economic success on the
continent, providing faster paths for spreading the virus through very good
ports and trade routes. Now, in 2001, about 5 million South Africans are
HIV-positive. That is about 11% of the population, with the peak age group
being 25 to 35 years. These are married people. As far as the youth are
concerned, there has been a significant drop in the age group 15 to 19
years since the inception of the disease. The drop is about 0,4%. They did
not mention that. However, in the 19 to 25 age group there is an increase.
These are married people. Women need to be empowered in marriage so that
they are able to negotiate condom usage with their husbands and partners
and, really, the terms of all matters concerning sex.

We hope that research into the usage of vaginal microbiocides can help our
women. Also we need more research into a female condom that is acceptable
to women. I must tell the Minister that the women's condom that exists at
the moment is atrocious, to say the least. We have about 200 000 Aids
orphans. South Africa has reached the phase where HIV-positivity is
peaking. We are moving into the next phase, which is the Aids and death
epidemic. What must we do?

If 11% of the population is HIV-positive, it means that 89% is negative
and, therefore, prevention is still our biggest opportunity. We must
continue to strengthen our prevention strategies, such as the ABC. Condoms
must be easily available in all strategic places and sex education from
primary school, before teenagers are sexually active, must be in place.

We must applaud this Government for having introduced sex education in our
schools. Still on prevention, there is the issue of maternal foetal
transmission, where several measures can be used, for example, the
termination of pregnancy in the first trimester; the use of anti-
retrovirals, AZT and nevirapine; proper management of labour, such as no
rupture of membranes, no instrumentation during delivery and avoiding
episiotomies; and the use of Caesarean section, when appropriate.

We need to strengthen the treatment of opportunistic infections, for
example, tuberculosis, pneumonia, cryptococcal meningitis, oral and throat
thrush, diarrhoea, shingles and skin infections. The House will have
noticed that I have not dealt with any aspect of treatment in detail. In
this disease, we can only talk of a comprehensive management strategy.
Every item of treatment is essential at various stages of the illness, be
it nutrition, vitamins, antibiotics, antiretrovirals, emotional support,
etc.

Taking all these together makes a difference in the course of the disease.
I have just emerged from private practice and have seen the devastation
caused by Aids. Sufferers and their families do not know which way to turn.
They are rudely chased away from public hospitals and clinics, offensive
language is used by a significant number of caregivers, and the sufferers
then gravitate to the family doctors, who know what to do, but are limited
by costs. The situation is desperate.

Let me talk about testing. It is the bottom line in HIV/Aids management.
More and more people are willing to be tested, if time and patience are
taken to counsel them and explain that benefits will accrue from knowing
one's status, and that there is a lot to be gained.

There was, and there still is, a resistance to testing, when people think
that one tests only to be a statistic and face stigmatisation. Ways must be
found around these difficulties. I am saying there is a life after testing,
and there are many examples of people who can attest to this.

One of the ways may be to begin to emphasise that Aids is a chronic
disease, in the same way that we categorise diseases such as hypertension,
diabetes, cancer and so forth. We categorise them as chronic, and we should
begin to manage HIV/Aids along the same principles that we do these
diseases.

Sensational adjectives when referring to HIV/Aids, such as killer disease
and umashayabhuqe, do not help. I think we should just think of the
language we use. It frightens people and puts them off coming forward.
Abantu bamane bathi: vele lesi sifo zizongibulala, njengoba kushiwo nje
ukuthi yisifo esibulalayo, umuntu akaphili. Indlela okushiwo ngayo ukuthi
lesi sifo siyabulala, kumane kucace nje ukuthi uma unaso, kumele ulindele
ukufa. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[People just say: ``Of course this disease is going to kill me since it is
a fatal disease, no one has ever survived.'' The way it is said, that this
disease is fatal, makes it clear that if a person has got this disease, the
person is definitely going to die.]

That is how people interpret it. So this discourages people from coming
forward and being testing, when, in fact, they could get some help. What
are the challenges for South Africa ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr O BALOYI: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President and hon members, let us
examine, being reasonable, the subject of so-called poor service delivery
and so-called nonavailability of drugs in some of our clinics, daycare
centres and hospitals.

In the public health service, the following challenges exist: There are
stifling problems which one could point out, such as shortages of suitably
qualified and trained personnel, especially at senior-management and middle-
management levels. There are difficulties of recruitment and retention of
highly and suitably qualified health professionals in the public health
service, which situation is worse in the deep rural areas, where they are
needed most.

There is the challenge of the continuing poor state of maintenance and
upkeep, as well as repair of some of the public health facilities. There
still are challenges with respect to the shortages of appropriate and
suitable equipment in some of our health facilities, and where this
equipment is in place, there are challenges of ensuring that this is
properly maintained.

The drug procurement, distribution and dispensing system remains a
challenge, exacerbated by the increasing illnesses due to HIV/Aids and its
complications. With HIV/Aids, more and more patients require more frequent
medication and treatment. Patient days in hospitals and service delivery
facilities have markedly increased.
Having stated all these challenges, let it be pointed out that reasonable
progress has been made to restructure health services, so that all
communities can afford and access comprehensive integrated primary health
care services, as well as the services at higher levels. Greater focus
needs to be given to the issues I have raised in this debate, and all
energies must be concentrated on addressing these challenges. All available
resources, public or private, must be tapped to ensure well-managed health
services for the country.

We applaud the efforts that are currently under way to formalise the
nonformal health sector, such as traditional healers, and to draft enabling
legislation for the benefit of this sector, as well as the users of this
sector. It is imperative that this process be speeded up to protect the
public from charlatans and opportunists. Appropriate budgets must be set
aside for this process, to create a council to control the affairs of
traditional healers.

It is appreciated that the Department of Health has identified the district
health system development, the disease prevention and control programme
and, among other things, human resource development, as priority areas. We
applaud the department for doing so. The outputs and outcomes of these
strategies will require close monitoring.

There is an expectation from Parliament and the portfolio committee, that
the department will provide ongoing progress updates. The IFP will support
the budget. [Applause.]

Dkt S C CWELE: Sihlalo, inkulumo yami izogxila endleleni abantu abaphatha
ngayo imitholampilo nezibhedlela zethu - engingathi phecelezi ...
(Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[Dr S C CWELE: Madam Speaker, my speech will focus on the way people manage
our hospitals and clinics. This is what I can call ...]

... the quality of care in our health institutions. Gradually, we are
moving away from our painful and inhumane past to a culture of human rights
in our health care. We are moving away from the inhumane and undignified
manner in which our people like Steve Biko, Elda Bani and many others died
in the hands of district surgeons collaborating with the state security
forces. We are moving away from the era when scientists and doctors like
Wouter Basson of Project Coast subverted science and developed drugs such
as Mandrax and other toxins to use against our black township residents
under the guise of research for crowd control.

During its first term the ANC government concentrated on improving access
to health care for all citizens. We brought services closer to the people
by moving away from a hospital- orientated system to a primary health care
approach. We built clinics in deserving areas and started rehabilitating
our hospitals after years of neglect by the NP government.

We introduced a code of good practice for our public servants, namely Batho
Pele. In 1999 our Minister gave real meaning to the code by launching the
Patients' Rights Charter. This expressed the Government's commitment to the
fundamental values of the national health system. It is a comprehensive
service available to all and it is responsive to the expressed needs of our
people, and above all, a service delivered with compassion and respect, at
all times preserving the dignity of the recipients of the service.

Lesi sibophezelo sikaHulumeni sithi masibe nobuntu, nenhlonipho nesizotha
uma selapha iziguli emitholampilo nasezibhedlela zethu. Nakuba
siwahalalisela la magalelo enqubekela-phambili, uKhongolose -
njengenhlangano engumnsinsi wokuzimilela emphakathini - ukhathazekile
ngobudedengu nesihluku abantu abaphathwa ngaso kwezinye izikhungo zempilo.
(Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[This governing principle says that we should all have ubuntu, respect and
humility when we treat patients at our clinics and hospitals. Although we
appreciate these steps forward, the ANC as an old organisation in our
society is unhappy about the negligence and rudeness with which people are
treated at some health institutions.]

It is against this background that critique reviews of the quality of
service by the Public Service Commission, the Health Systems Trust and from
the ordinary people themselves are welcomed by the ANC, because they can
make us serve our public better.

U-ANC uthi akwamukelekile ukuthi kusekhona omabhalane, abahlengikazi
nodokotela imbala abasaqhubeka nokuphatha iziguli ngesihluku - bezenza
izikhonzi lapho kuyilungelo lazo ukuthi zelashwe. Kusekhona izikhungo lapho
imithi kuyaywe kuthiwe iphelile noma kuthiwe leyo okufanele ikhishwe
ngosuku isiqediwe, ngisho ama-script quotas. Kuyaye kuphoqeleke ukuthi
iziguli zihambe amabanga amade, zibuye ngakusasa zizokuma emigqeni emide,
ukuze zithole usizo nemithi.

Kusekhona izibhedlela lapho iziguli kudingeka ziphathe izingubo zokulala
khona, fuze zilaleze, ngenxa yobudedengu kwabaphethe amalondolo. Ama-
ambulensi awenele noma kawatholakali kweminye imitholampilo ezindaweni
zabantu abamnyama nasezabelweni, ikakhulukazi ebusuku. Kuyadabukisa ukuzwa
ukuthi e-Northern Province kunomama owayekhulelwe, wawa ku-ambulensi
washona ngesikhathi umhlengikazi ethokomele esihlalweni esingaphambili
nomshayeli. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[The ANC says it is unacceptable that we still have clerks, nurses and even
doctors who treat patients rudely. They are making patients feel like
subjects, while it is their right to be treated. There are institutions
where they say they have no medicines or they have no script quotas.
Patients are sometimes forced to walk long distances and to come back the
next day to stand in long queues for medicines. There are hospitals where
patients are expected to bring their own blankets otherwise they sleep
without any blankets because of the carelessness of those who are running
laundries. There are not enough ambulances or there are no ambulances at
all at clinics situated in the areas where black people live and in the
rural areas, especially at night. It is saddening to hear that in the
Northern Province there was a pregnant woman who died in the ambulance
while the nurse was sitting comfortably with the driver.]

The ANC has zero tolerance for those who blatantly display ill discipline.

Akwemukelekile ukuthi kwezinye izikhungo zempilo, njengase-Addington
Hospital nakweminye imitholampilo, amasango ayavalwa ebusuku. Lokhu kubeka
impilo yabadinga usizo engcupheni. Sithi nasemphakathini akwemukelekile
ukuthi kukhona abantu abagqekeza imitholampilo, bantshontshe baze
bahlukumeze abahlengikazi nawodokotela. Lokhu kwenza ukuthi singakwazi
ukuzivula imini nobusuku izikhungo zempilo noma kudingeke ukuthi siqashe
onogada ngemali engabe sisiza ngayo imiphakathi.

Ama-ambulensi nezimoto ezihambisa imithi ziyaphangwa emalokishini
nakwezinye izindawo zasemaphandleni. Labo baphangi bezimoto benza kube
nzima ukuthutha iziguli ebusuku, ikakhulukazi ezindaweni ezifana noBhizana
noLusikisiki.

Kusekhona izibhedlela nemitholampilo lapho abantu bebuya khona
bengachazelwanga ukuthi baphethwe yini noma kwenzekani kubo. Kwesinye
isikhathi abakhathalelwa nokubuzwa ukuthi bahlala ezindaweni ezinjani
nokuthi eyabo imibono ithini. Bavele bagidlabezwe ngemithi kubizwe
olandelayo. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[It is unacceptable that in some health care institutions like Addington
Hospital and others, the gates are closed at night. This puts the lives of
those who need assistance in danger. To society we say it is unacceptable
that there are people who break into clinics to steal things and even
harass doctors and nurses. This makes it impossible to open these
institutions day and night or we need to hire security guards who should be
paid with the money that is supposed to help communities.

Ambulances and vehicles that transport medicines are hijacked in townships
and in other places in the rural areas. Those hijackers make it impossible
to transport patients at night, especially in places like Bhizana and
Lusikisiki.

There are hospitals and clinics from where people return home without
having been told what they were suffering from. Sometimes no one cares to
ask about the type of environment in which they live and to ask their
opinion. They are just given medicines and a pharmacist calls the next
patient.]

Some of the interventions will cost us nothing. It costs nothing to be
courteous. One needs to smile, and show respect and dignity to the patient,
because he needs a change in attitude.

All of us have the responsibility to popularise Batho Pele and the
Patients' Rights Charter. This should not just be an event, but a living
campaign in our communities. We need to train and support our managers,
particularly in the phase where there is an interface with the public, to
move away from a service-oriented to a patient-oriented approach. We need
to revisit the hospital boards and clinic committees. We must have
representatives from the areas where most of the patients live in these
communities.

It is in this way that we can ensure that the views of the users, not a
distant elite, are taken into account when planning and delivering our
services. We need to maintain the constant contact with our communities,
take their concerns seriously and inform them about the levels of service
we offer at a particular institution. It is our view as the ANC that local
government councillors should be encouraged and empowered to play an active
role in these committees.

In conclusion, we pay tribute to all those men and women in our health care
service who, under challenging circumstances of transformation, continue to
inspire our communities through hard work, compassion and dedication. It is
because of them that we support the annual health care awards at both
district and national levels. It is time to introduce the long-awaited
Cecilia Makhiwane award for the most dedicated nurses.

We should draw from many examples of good practice throughout the length
and breadth of our country. We should draw from the experiences of the
health Batho Pele pilot projects we had in the North West province.
Clearly, we can never eradicate all the problems of years of neglect in one
day. We should dedicate this term of office to improving the quality of
service we render. We should unite in purpose to ensure better health care
for all our citizens. Ngiyabonga. [Thank you.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Madam Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to
respond. First of all, I would like to thank all those who participated in
this debate. Some of the comments have indeed been useful and will assist
us as we map the way forward towards improving the quality of care that we
give to our people. I must particularly acknowledge the quality of the
debate by the ANC members in this Parliament. It just went to show that
they indeed understand the issues that are facing us and have guided us as
to how we need to tackle them.

I think it would be absolutely foolish of me even to begin to listen to the
DP, particularly as they advise me on issues regarding HIV and Aids. Where
were they all this time? They have only just had one summit at which they
talked about HIV and Aids. They have only developed their policy at the end
of last year. They are the Johnnies-come-lately in the response to HIV and
Aids. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

I think they can scream as much as they want to. There are many people in
this House who have more valuable advice than Ms Kalyan and Mr Ellis. I
will not take their advice, because they do not know what they are talking
about. All that these people know is to run to Geneva and Switzerland in an
effort to develop ...

Mr M J ELLIS: We did not go to those places!

The MINISTER: They did and I am not going to listen to them. They do not
know anything about these issues because, after all, they are not even
rooted in the communities. So how can they even begin to talk about these
issues? [Applause.]

They have eight years to catch up with us. We introduced a policy on
HIV/Aids and the strategic plan in 1992. Where were these members? They
were here and we were in exile. They were here and they did not say
anything and therefore they cannot advise us. [Interjections.]

I could not have dealt with all health issues in the short period of just
30 minutes, These are issues that relate to the health resources
development plan and rural health. I did indicate that I would deal with
these issues in the NCOP. Then hon members who asked questions around these
issues will have the opportunity to read the speech. Hon members are
therefore invited to come and listen to me in the NCOP next week.

We are working very closely with Denosa and the Nursing Council and we are
dealing with the issues that have been raised in this regard, particularly
around health development.

I want to inform Dr Gous that not all doctors in this country are male. The
hon member kept on saying ``he, he, he''. This just indicates the hon
member's attitude, language and sexist and class ethos. The hon member has
not moved an inch. The ANC will continue to fight for gender sensitivity.

I also want to inform Ms Dudley that we will continue to pray. I appreciate
the fact that the hon member has joined us in spreading the message of
abstaining and being faithful, but, of course, using condoms. This should
be done by those people who cannot do the first two. With regard to
abortions, I just wanted to inform the hon member that I am sure that she
is not rooted in the communities. There are many church women and families
who are grateful that this piece of legislation was introduced and that we
have been able to save many women's lives who otherwise were exposed to
backstreet abortions. The hon member needs to come along with us as we
visit these communities and listen for herself. She may change her
opinions.

I want to deal with the issue that was raised by the hon Mulder and in part
by Ms Kalyan and Ntate Mogoba. I have just returned from Geneva, where I
attended a consultative forum where we were trying to assist the Secretary-
General of the United Nations to give shape and form to the global fund on
HIV/Aids and health. What became very clear in that meeting was that the
Sub-Saharan member states have developed strategies and have policies in
place. The only problem is that there is a big gap between having
strategies and having the resources to implement those strategies. This was
recognised by all participants at that forum.

Having attended all these meetings, I can say that never before in the
history of the WHO and UNAids has the issue of HIV/Aids and poverty taken
such a high profile in debates on these issues. It is thanks to our hon
President Mbeki who in the first instance posed these questions. All
programmes and decisions that are taken at these forums today testify to
the fact that one cannot deal with HIV/Aids and forget about poverty.

And so I would like to thank Mrs Gxowa for the letter that she received and
also for the compassionate manner in which the hon member dealt with these
issues. It is in this context that we are today working very hard in the
development and shaping of the Millennium Africa Recovery Programme. It is
by addressing the issues of poverty and underdevelopment that one can begin
to think of an intersectoral approach both to HIV/Aids and to the issues of
health.

Questions were raised about the training of lay counsellors and that this
was not co-ordinated. I just want to remind this House that in one of our
interventions we did mention the fact that we have now completed the
curriculum and it is there. We therefore urge provinces and everybody else
who trains lay counsellors to use that curriculum. We have worked very hard
to ensure that there is co-ordination and equality of training, so that it
will benefit the HIV-positive people, of whom we should be taking care, and
those who are affected.

I want to inform both hon members Mulder and Rev Mogoba that we need to
translate our words into actions. There is no confusion about HIV/Aids. All
we need to do is to pool all our efforts and energies, and ensure that we
respond in a way consistent with our strategic plan to those affected and
infected by the virus. Reference has also been made to the fact that
perhaps we do not allocate enough resources for HIV/Aids and health in
general. This may well be, but let me also remind this House that after our
debt payment, two thirds of the budget of this country is allocated to
social services.

In our view, if one has not attended to issues of water, sanitation,
welfare and education one cannot even begin to talk about health. We know
that it is these very same components that impact on the health status of
our people. We are satisfied that as the Government we are moving in the
right direction and have ensured that there is an increase for service
allocation in the services in this country.

I want to inform Mrs Malumise, since she referred quite a great deal to TB,
that a meeting of SADC member states started today, where we are developing
tools for training managers on the TB and HIV epidemic. This is very
important because these issues need to be addressed in an integrated
manner.

The hon Rajbally referred to the two hospitals that are being built. I want
to thank her very much for that observation. But, let me also inform this
House that over and above that we have upgraded over 86 hospitals in the
country. Hon members will recall that there was an audit of hospitals in
1986 in which it became very clear that we needed R1 billion to upgrade and
improve hospitals so that they are user-friendly to the people who visit
them. We are in the process of doing this. I did refer to the hospital
revitalisation programme in this regard.

The hon Ms Luthuli referred to the need for research. Let me inform the
House that there is continued research on microbiocides and the female
condom. We are strengthening the distribution of condoms from
nonconventional points.

I will answer some of the issues that I have not been able to refer to
during question time. I am hoping that this time the questions from the DP
will not be rhetoric, as they always are. They should listen to the
speeches that are presented and the answers that we provide them with when
these questions are asked.

In closing, and having already thanked all those who officially work in the
health sector, I would like to express just one final private and very
personal thank you. That personal thank you goes to my husband, Comrade
Mendi Msimang, who is sitting over there in the gallery. [Applause.] His
support, experience and knowledge are absolutely invaluable to me, and
therefore, I believe, also to the people of South Africa, especially the
poor, whom I serve with humility and passion. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                        REMARK MADE BY MR H P CHAUKE

                                  (Ruling)

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Before I go on to the next Order of the Day, I
wish to give a ruling on two points of order which were raised on 29 May
2001 during the speech by Mr Chauke on the Sport and Recreation Vote.

The first point of order by Mr Lee was to the effect that Mr Chauke had
implied that Mr Lee was a thief by linking him with Mr Abe Williams. I have
examined the Hansard and found that Mr Chauke's remarks concerning Mr Abe
Williams and Mr Lee do not provide sufficient grounds for making the
inference that Mr Lee is a thief.

A further point of order was raised by Mr Moorcroft, namely that Mr
Chauke's words constituted a threat. Mr Chauke had said: ``We will lock him
up somewhere and leave him there.'' [Laughter.] Those words were followed
by: ``We will be dealing with him.'' [Laughter.] It is actually not funny,
as the other members are saying. These remarks, taken together, may be
regarded as constituting a threat, and that is unparliamentary. I
accordingly call upon Mr Chauke to withdraw these words.

Mr H P CHAUKE: Madam Speaker, as an hon member of this House, I would like
to withdraw the words. We are not going to take Mr Lee to the correctional
services. [Laughter.]

                            ESKOM CONVERSION BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President
and hon members, I am pleased to present to the House the Eskom Conversion
Bill. Allow me to commend the chairperson, Mr Saki Belot, and members of
the portfolio committee for their hard work in processing this Bill. I also
wish to thank the various stakeholders who used their time to make
submissions and to engage with my department on this Bill. Their engagement
has been valuable, and the amendments have considerably improved the Bill.

This Bill has its origin in the Eskom Amendment Act of 1998, which paved
the way for the removal of Eskom's tax-exempt status and also instructed
the Minister for Public Enterprises to incorporate Eskom as a company in
terms of the Companies Act. Therefore, this is a technical Bill with a
specific objective. It seeks, in a nutshell, to incorporate Eskom as a
public company in terms of the Companies Act, without interfering with any
of its current operations and obligations, and also without diluting its
existing obligations regarding performance, financial reporting and
accountability. These safeguards are maintained through the Public Finance
Management Act, and are also enhanced by the Companies Act.

The Bill's definition of ``deeming'' includes the protection of the rights
of Eskom employees and workers, and respect for collective agreements
entered into between the employees and Eskom, thereby strengthening the
safeguards I have already mentioned. Our Government's commitment to Eskom's
developmental role in our society is undisputed. This Bill requires that
the development of the enabling documents, such as the shareholder
compacts, will not spell out its development role in much more detail in
the Bill. We have stated before that Eskom occupies a strategic position in
our economy, and that it is critical to the realisation of Government's
efforts for a better life for all South Africans.

Hon members, there will not be any tampering with the running of Eskom as a
business despite the repeal of the Eskom Act of 1987, which currently
administers Eskom. To ensure continuity, and that there are some safeguards
in this particular regard, the shareholder compact, as well as the
memorandum and articles of association of the new company, will serve as
custodians of any responsibilities imposed by the Eskom Act, even beyond
incorporation.

The Eskom Conversion Bill is not introducing anything new to subject Eskom
to a tax regime. Critically, the tax-exempt status was dealt with in the
Tax Amendment Law of July 2000, and we have to implement the provisions of
that particular law. All that the Eskom Conversion Bill seeks to achieve in
this regard is to define the process of how such a tax regime will be
implemented.

Concerns have been raised that taxation of this entity presupposes a hike
in the price of electricity. I wish to alleviate those fears by publicly
stating that the movement in the electricity prices is not dictated by
elements such as taxation. The fact remains that other variables such as
input costs, of which tax is not a part, inform movements in the price of
electricity.

For the sake of completeness, it is imperative that the electrification
programme is not sacrificed by the taxation of Eskom. Our Government is
committed to redeploying funds and other resources into the National
Electrification Fund. There already exists a solid agreement between
various departments and the SA Revenue Service that the taxation of Eskom
will be phased in gradually and systematically to avoid any unintended
consequences.

Whilst wishing to maintain continuity in terms of Eskom's operations and
obligations, it is necessary to highlight some of the key benefits of
conversion. Government needs to have a consistent approach in its
management of state-owned enterprises. It is within this context that
Government wants to create Eskom as a tax- and dividend-paying entity,
which resources will be used to enhance the programme of Government on
economic and social development. Conversion will also level the playing
field between Eskom and its counterparts in the telecommunication and
transport sectors such as Telkom and Transnet, which are also companies in
terms of the Companies Act.

By converting Eskom into a company, the payment of dividends by Eskom to
its shareholder becomes a normal business practice in the corporate sector,
as understood by both investors and lenders internationally. I should
emphasise that this is important for Eskom's ability to raise capital at
competitive rates so that the relationship between Government as
shareholder and Eskom is located within the framework of corporate
governance that is understood by all stakeholders.

The conversion of Eskom will also enhance the governance structures of this
entity. The two-tier structure of the Electricity Council and the
management board will also be done away with. This will be replaced with a
board of directors to be appointed by Government as a shareholder and as
required by the Companies Act. This will also apply to all subsidiaries of
Eskom since the latter will be a holding company for existing subsidiaries
and those that are to be established in the future.

I want to emphasise that this Bill is not about the privatisation of Eskom.
I have stated before that, in considering the restructuring options for
Eskom, it was important to recognise that Eskom is one of the most
efficient and low-cost producers of energy in the world. Eskom plays a very
critical developmental role in ensuring that energy is accessible to the
majority of South African citizens.

In recent times, Eskom has also started to operate in other African
countries to provide energy and other energy-related services. As a
Government, we do not intend to undermine these strengths, nor its
strategic capacity.

Our Government is committed to the managed liberalisation of the energy
sector, implemented within the context of retaining Eskom as a dominant
energy supplier in South Africa. It is our intention to engage with labour
on the restructuring of the energy sector, which we do from time to time,
in general and with Eskom in particular. The place for such engagement is
not the forums aimed at discussing the Eskom Conversion Bill, but the
National Framework Agreement between Government and organised labour.
Therefore, I wish to reiterate our Government's commitment to a rigorous
engagement with organised labour on the energy sector restructuring plan.

Hon members will agree with me that it has not been easy to come this far.
I, therefore, wish to conclude by sincerely thanking members for having
turned this process into a reality. Allow me to express a word of gratitude
to the office of the Chief State Law Adviser for their advice and guidance.
I also wish to thank the team from Eskom, particularly, Benji Mothibedi,
Mpho Matjila and Mohammed Adam, together with the officials from my
department, for the manner in which they gave themselves selflessly to see
this process to completion. With those words, I would like hon members to
support the Eskom Conversion Bill. [Applause.]

Debate interrupted.

                               POINT OF ORDER

                                  (Ruling)

The SPEAKER: Hon members, I regret interrupting the debate in order to give
a ruling. This concerns a point of order that was raised during the
President's Question Time on Wednesday. The hon Mr Andrew asked whether it
was parliamentary for the Minister of Safety and Security to shake his fist
at opposition members. I undertook to check the video footage. I have now
seen the video and confirm that the hon Mr Andrew's point of order was well-
taken. The hon Minister of Safety and Security has requested an opportunity
to make a personal explanation in regard to those events. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Speaker, the waving of that fist
was not done with any intention to inflict harm on any member of the
opposition. I do acknowledge that, indeed, I did wave the fist in that
direction, and I would like to extend an apology for that. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, there is no excuse for waving your fists in the
air. [Laughter.] I am glad that no one has taken a point of order on the
waving of a finger. Hon Mr Andrew, thank you for being in the House.

                            ESKOM CONVERSION BILL

                    (Resumption of Second Reading debate)

Mr R J HEINE: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, hon Minister, and hon
members, the purpose of the Bill is to convert Eskom from a statutory
juristic body into a public company with share capital incorporated in
terms of the Companies Act in order to, firstly, bring about more
efficiency and competitiveness in the running of Eskom. Secondly, to expose
Eskom to global trends and, thirdly, to ensure that Eskom observes and is
run in terms of a protocol on co-operative governance.

The benefit to the country on the unbundling of Eskom is that in the long
run Eskom might decide to draw on the benefits of listing on the Stock
Exchange and, in that event, citizens and foreigners alike will be in a
position to acquire shares in Eskom. Eskom can only be listed on a stock
exchange if it is a company, and Government is preparing for that
eventuality, should it arise. I do not think that any person who has the
interest of the country at heart can disagree with this motivation to
process the Eskom Conversion Bill.

It is therefore surprising that Cosatu and the SACP have been so vehemently
opposed to this conversion, except to reiterate what I said on Friday, that
they are pursuing an ideology that is long dead and buried, and therefore
cannot see the wood for the trees. They are now, in their latest press
release, trying to blame the department officials for not looking after
their interests.

Cosatu was fully involved in this whole process, but it now appears that
they are expecting the department's officials to motivate their amendments
to the portfolio committee and the portfolio committee simply has to rubber-
stamp their proposed amendments. [Interjections.]

For the record, I must state that all their proposed amendments were
brought to the portfolio committee and the end result that we have today
was derived after a full discussion by the portfolio committee. However,
let us not waste further time on this issue and let us rather look at the
way forward.

I want to refer to the speech by Mr Lionel Jospin, the French Prime
Minister, when he addressed Parliament on 31 May 2001:
  Globalisation is the reality with which we have to live today. Markets
  opening, free movement of capital, and the unprecedented speed at which
  information flows today have created a global growth dynamic. This is a
  reality.

I would like to suggest that Cosatu and the SACP take a hard look at this
statement and examine their future role in the strengthening of our economy
and job creation. What is important for our success is the future
management of these state-owned enterprises in strict adherence to
corporate governance. Corporate governance is not a matter of choice, but
is a must for state-owned enterprises and entities to be successful.

As early as 1997, Government had already taken a view that corporate
governance in state entities was necessary, and through the protocol, a way
was paved for good governance to prevail in the state entities.

The instruments of corporate governance have to be observed and
implemented, in other words, the shareholder compacts - and the Minister
has referred to that - the reporting strategies, legislation, etc. Time
does not allow me to measure our success so far in achieving these goals,
but we do not need another Coleman Andrews disaster.

In closing, I wish to thank all the department's and Eskom's officials for
their contributions and the portfolio committee for bringing this Eskom
Conversion Bill to finality. We extend our best wishes to the hon the
Minister on implementation. The DA supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr S T BELOT: Mr Chairperson, Deputy President, Ministers and hon members,
I wish to join the Minister in thanking the members of the portfolio
committee for processing the Eskom Conversion Bill in a constructive and
efficient manner. This Bill is a result of a directive by the Eskom
Amendment Act of 1998, as indicated by the Minister, so that it could be
corporatised.

I am pleased, therefore, to report that the portfolio committee has
satisfied itself that, in fulfilling this directive, all the necessary
prescribed requirements have been met and satisfied. The portfolio
committee invited stakeholders and interested parties to make written
submissions, which were followed up by verbal evidence given before the
committee. I am happy, therefore, to report that our major stakeholders
seized this opportunity. They interacted with the portfolio committee and
made their views known.

As indicated earlier on by the hon the Minister, the Bill seeks to
incorporate Eskom as a public company in terms of the Companies Act. This
will be done without interfering with any of the current operations and
obligations of Eskom. The committee painstakingly considered all the
proposed amendments to meet all stakeholders' concerns. One of the proposed
amendments was the section that states that:

Eskom conversion does not -


  The conversion of Eskom does not -


  (a) affect the continued corporate existence of Eskom as from the date of
       its first establishment;


  (b) affect any of the rights, liabilities or obligations acquired or
       incurred by Eskom, or on Eskom's behalf, at any time before its
       conversion; and


  (c) affect the terms and conditions of service of its employees.

Section 6(5) reads as follows:


  When entering into the Shareholder compact as well as determining the
  articles of association, the Minister must take into account the
  following -


  (a) The developmental role of Eskom Holdings Limited; and


  (b) the promotion of universal access to, and the provision of,
       affordable electricity taking into account the cost of electricity
       ... financial sustainability and the competitiveness of Eskom.

Once more, I wish to repeat that the ANC continues to be informed by the
perspective that economics is about people, their work, their ownership of
productive assets or lack of it, their share of what they produce, what
they buy and sell, their accommodation, their recreation, in fact, every
element which one describes as quality of life, flows from the structure
and management of the economy.

I once more need to repeat, for emphasis, that this Bill is not about
privatisation. I need to caution that to deliberately interpret the policy
of restructuring as privatisation is not only misrepresenting the policies
of this country, it is tantamount to badmouthing the country, because
privatisation is just an element of the whole programme of restructuring.

I therefore wish to say that this Bill will assist in assuring that the
Government's development agenda is realised. We therefore support this
Bill. [Applause.]

Dr S C CWELE: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it parliamentary for
Mr Heine to shake his head against the ANC whilst the speaker is on the
floor.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That is not a point of order.

Mr M D MSOMI: Mr Chairperson, the great father of the Rolls Royce motor
manufacturer, whom I admire very much, Henry Royce, once said, and I quote:


  Let's try for perfection in everything we do. Take the best that exists
  and make it better. When it does not exist, design it, accepting nothing
  nearly right or good enough.

This is notwithstanding the dream I once had that one day I would own a
Rolls Royce.

This Bill is part of an evolutionary process, started by the Portfolio
Committee on Public Enterprises in the 1997-1998 financial year to expose
Eskom to market conditions so as to become competitive and efficient in the
global village of other energy utility entities. The intention of the Bill
is intertwined with the Government's strategic intent of restructuring,
reframing and revitalising the state-owned enterprises to become tax-paying
and dividend-declaring legal entities and to maximise Eskom's contribution
to economic development in South Africa, in which the state is the sole
shareholder.

This is an empowering piece of legislation which creates an investor-
friendly environment which provides for certainty in Eskom's ability to
service its debts, without tampering with its assets base, and gives
comfort to long-term loan repayment schedules. This piece of legislation
provides guarantees for the employees of Eskom even beyond the Labour
Relations Act passed by this Parliament, to give certainty to succession
planning and long-term stability in the energy market in a manner that has
not been done before.

This Bill grants the Minister discretionary powers to ensure continuous
attention to the memorandum and articles of association and the shareholder
compact to compel employees of Eskom to take responsibility for their
actions in executing their mandate in line with the shareholder compact,
and has created a precedent whereby the shareholders' compact and the
memorandum and articles of association of state-owned enterprises will come
before Parliament for our scrutiny where the state is the sole shareholder.

This Bill seeks to reaffirm the developmental role of Eskom in providing
electricity to the underdeveloped areas of our society, to correct the
imbalance of the past, as well as to make the process transparent and
subject to public scrutiny without impacting negatively on Eskom's ability
to attract inward investments.
It is very encouraging to note that the portfolio committee, in its
consideration of this Bill, followed a hardline business approach on a
nonpartisan basis, carrying no brief for anybody, but were determined to
create an enabling legislative environment to enable Eskom to become
globally competitive in a market-driven economy.

The IFP supports this Bill. We can sate without hesitation that we have had
a positive effect on the the final Bill through our participation in the
portfolio committee's deliberations. We convinced the committee to follow
the correct route in converting Eskom without limiting the discretion of
the Minister too much to mandatory procedures before he could execute his
mandate.

What did we achieve? We achieved harmony between Eskom's obligation to long-
term loan repayments with social responsibility and the development role to
poor communities. We achieved the declared peace between future investor
demands and the hotly contested labour relations issues. We went to war
with a number of stakeholders on principle-centred issues and we finally
secured peace and paved the way for this Bill to become binding on all
stakeholders and to be respected by generations to come.
Finally, we exercised the constitutional mandate of the parliamentary
committee's legislative role to the best of our ability in the best way
possible without harming relations with the majority of the stakeholders.
[Applause.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Mr Chairperson, when Neil Armstrong took his first
step on the moon he proclaimed: One small step for man, one giant leap for
mankind. Today the tabling and approval of the Eskom Conversion Bill will
be one small step for Parliament but one giant leap for Government in
ridding itself of the bondage of Cosatu and the SACP and the grip it has
over those positive-minded members within the ranks of the ANC.

The DA has always said that it would support every good piece of
legislation that was aimed at building the South African economy. Therefore
it is with ease that we can talk in support of this Bill before Parliament.

The aim of this Bill is exactly in line with what I pleaded for during the
Budget Vote on public enterprises. The conversion will bring about more
efficiency and effectiveness in the running of Eskom in a competitive
environment, not only locally but also globally, where Eskom will be
exposed to global trends. It will ensure that Eskom is managed according to
the principles of co-operative governance. I must say that I did not think
for one moment that the Minister and the department would adhere and
respond to my request so speedily. I want to thank the Minister.

As this Bill is also aimed at enabling Eskom to make a substantial
contribution to the state coffers in future, Eskom will also contribute to
the Government's responsibility in achieving its social objectives - an
area, we all know, where the Government is failing dismally and then
usually opts to hide behind apartheid as a scapegoat at every opportunity.

The DA believes that one of the social objectives of this Government should
be to build South Africa into one nation irrespective of race, colour or
religion. Unfortunately, the member Mrs Newhoudt-Druchen and Minister Pahad
lost an opportunity to lay a solid foundation for nation-building when they
addressed this Parliament in the presence of the children who attended the
Children's Day celebrations. [Interjections.] Those children who sat in the
gallery on Friday are part of the future of this country. They are those
towards whom we have a responsibility. They are not interested in the hate
that the hon the Minister and that member carry within themselves.

My question to those two members is: Why was it necessary to contaminate
those children with their hatred and bitterness? How long do they still
want to keep this nation apart? Can they not become part of a message of
unity and hope? I want to say to those members: This Parliament does not
need them, as much as South Africa does not need the negative approach ...
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Van Jaarsveld, could you please
address the subject of the debate?

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: I am addressing the subject, Chair. This Parliament
does not need the negative approach of Cosatu and its tirades of anarchy
and chaos when things do not go their way. We in the DA say to Cosatu: It
is bad for the comrades who want to make a positive contribution and it is
bad for those people who want to invest in this country. Economic growth
provides employment which will enable those of us who care for all the
people of this country, be they young or old, black or white, retarded or
gifted, to create hope for the future and to improve the quality of life of
all South Africans.

I want to close by congratulating the chairperson of the committee, the hon
Belot, the staff of the department, the representatives of Eskom, and in
the final analysis, the Minister for Public Enterprises for their dedicated
effort in driving this process of the Eskom Conversion Bill. This was
amidst the allegations of Cosatu that the Minister was taking the country
backwards instead of forwards with the privatisation of state assets
programme.

Cosatu thought that they could bully us around in the committee by using
the President. In the Cosatu documents submitted to the portfolio committee
they said, and I quote:


  Further, the then Deputy President Mbeki wrote a letter of reassurance to
  the Cosatu leadership that Government was not intending to privatise
  Eskom.

The latest state of Cosatu is indicating that the cracks in the alliance
are rapidly becoming bigger and bigger. One of these days the walls will be
crumbling down. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: The portfolio committee did not budge an inch.
Instead we agreed to launch Eskom on its way to restructuring and
ultimately to privatisation, whether the Minister wants to acknowledge that
or not. [Interjections.] The DA supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr M T GONIWE: Chairperson, on a point of order: I think the behaviour of
that member is totally unparliamentary. Contrary to your calls for order,
the speaker deliberately ignored the Chair. I would like you to rule on
that, please.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, all hon members - I am
addressing the whole House - it becomes very difficult when you know the
Rules in the House and you do not follow them. There is time prescribed for
the debate in this House and as Chair I have to adhere strictly to the time
given by the Chair with the agreement of the Whips. If I call on any member
that his or her time has expired, that member should not stay at the
podium. The hon member is quite correct. You are undermining the Chair and
I personally as a Chair do not like that. We have to co-operate on the
issue.

Secondly ... [Interjections.] Order! Secondly, there is a subject that you
need to address. If the Chair feels you are out of order and I call on you
to address the subject before the House - it is a Rule, it is there -
according to that Rule, I have the right to stop you immediately, but I do
not do so because at times members want to support their statements.
However, when it is vividly clear that you are out of order, I do call you
out of order to ask you to return to your speech. Let us co-operate with
the Chair for the better working of this House. [Applause.]

Mr M S BOOI: Chairperson, given the ruling you have just made in this
House, I just want to find out whether it would not be appropriate for the
member to apologise to the Chair for ignoring him. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, I have made a statement
addressing all of you in the House. I hope that all the members will adhere
to the statement that I have just made to the House.

Mr C T FROLICK: Chairperson, hon members, the overall aim of the Eskom
Conversion Bill has been clearly stated. Specifically the Bill aims to
bring about greater efficiency and competitiveness in the running of Eskom,
expose Eskom to grow with trends and ensure that Eskom observes and is run
in terms of a protocol and co-operative governance. The department has
argued that the benefit to the country of the unbundling of Eskom is that
in the long run Eskom might decide to draw on the benefits of listing on
the Stock Exchange and in that event citizens and foreigners alike will be
in the position to acquire shares in Eskom.

Eskom can only be listed if it is a company and the Government is preparing
for that eventuality, should it arise. These imperatives mean that
Government has to balance international investor demands for greater
competition and private sector involvement with local pressure for job
retention and creation whilst bolstering black economic empowerment.
Concerns have been expressed during the public hearings about the possible
escalation of electricity prices. Affordable electricity, competitively
priced against international norms, is one of the aspects that prospective
investors will look at. Already there is a perception that the cost of
doing business in South Africa is high. This factor needs to be closely
monitored. However, we welcome the Minister's undertaking in this regard.

We must not lose sight of the plight of workers at state-owned
organisations and enterprises. They have real fears and concerns about job
security. However, we urge stakeholders to deal with this issue decisively
within the proper forums instead of on a piecemeal basis. The criticism
aimed at the portfolio committee by Cosatu is a case in point. It appears
that Cosatu is using the opportunity to oppose certain aspects of the
restructuring process instead of taking their concerns about the overall
restructuring policy to the appropriate forum.

The committee took on board certain proposals on the bold, but it must be
noted that a complete acceptance of all proposals would have led to a messy
piece of legislation. The UDM supports the Bill.

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairperson, the ACDP stands squarely behind the concept of
privatisation, but it is the exception that proves the rule and we believe
in this instance Eskom is that exception. Whilst we agree that
organisational steps to make Eskom more accountable and transparent are
good, we believe this Bill represents enormous risk. This is a complex
issue that boils down to what the impact on tariffs would be. Eskom belongs
to the consumers and not to the state and it is in the interests of the
consumers to keep tariffs down. It is likely that black economic
empowerment may well gain, but at the expense of every household and much-
needed jobs.

This Bill cannot be taken lightly, as its consequences will reach into
every home, business and industry in South Africa. Very importantly, the
future development of Africa is reliant on electricity, as it is on
education, and with industry and the rest of the world suffering from
higher input costs, there is a move from manufacturing to service
industries, leaving Africa the opportunity of meeting the need for
manufacturing. This, however, will never be a reality unless there is
access to   low-cost power.

The impact of this Bill on SADC could be enormous, which begs the question:
Has SADC been consulted? Eskom has in fact been the greatest single agency
of development in Southern Africa, and, in breaking Eskom down, it would
become an unwieldy tool which could hinder South Africa's development.

South Africa is one of the oldest, most cost-effective producers of
electricity in the world - a fact which shielded us from the devastating
impact of rising oil prices. We are world leaders and have been ground
breakers. When rail, worldwide, was going diesel, South Africa electrified.

The privatisation of Eskom is clearly not a pressing priority, as a reason
for privatisation is cost-effectiveness, and in Eskom we already have
reasonable efficiency. Why then do we want to change fundamentally and take
the risk?

It is the view of the ACDP that there is insufficient understanding and no
real in-depth analysis of the situation and we will therefore vote against
the Bill.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson and hon members, the Eskom Conversion Bill
seeks to turn Eskom into a public company, and that will make it possible
for the facility to be free to be listed on the Stock Exchange. While we
welcome the fact that the envisaged Eskom Holdings Limited will inherit the
status of Eskom, warts and all, may we call on the Ministry to guard
against job losses that characterise such changes?

Clause 5(a) stipulates that Eskom must pay compensation for any damage
caused by its officers or employees in the performance of their duties upon
the land. Electrification causes damage to the environment, especially
during the installation stage. We hope, therefore, that the new company
will always compensate communities in whose areas they operate, without the
community leaders being vilified as impeding development by upstart civic
matters.

The UCDP, however, supports the Bill.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairman, this Bill is being debated in this Parliament at
a time when the four million people of Soweto have been at arms with Eskom
over its electricity services.
Eskom has embarked on a credit control drive to recover the R742 million it
claims it is owed. The people of Soweto are not campaigning for nonpayment
of money owed to Eskom. They complain that rates are unfair. Soweto
residents are charged 28 cents per kw, while Sandton residents are paying
16 cents and big businesses pay seven cents. In the rural areas, consumers
are charged 48 cents per kw.

The Bill serves to provide for the conversion of Eskom into a public
company, having a share capital incorporated in terms of the Companies Act.
The conversion will serve a good purpose only if the poor will not pay more
for electricity than the rich.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the MF welcomes the Eskom Conversion Bill, as
it allows for the state to gain from the tax collectors, as well as for
dividend payments from the incorporation of Eskom.

The MF applauds the Bill, since this could assist in bringing about
competitiveness as well as exposing Eskom globally. It is evident that the
Bill will be of much benefit for the country in terms of the Stock Exchange
as well as attracting many foreign investments.
Eskom is one of the most efficient enterprises in South Africa, supplying
95% of South Africa's domestic electricity requirements and nearly 60% of
the electricity consumed throughout South Africa.

The MF compliments the Government on consulting various departments,
including Eskom, before the introduction of the Bill, and also supports all
Government's initiatives in implementing the Bill.

The MF supports the Eskom Conversion Bill. I finished in the exact time,
Chairperson. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I wish all the other members could do that.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, die AEB steun gesonde sakebeginsels.
Hierdie wetgewing wat Eskom van 'n statutêre liggaam in 'n openbare
maatskappy verander, is 'n positiewe stap in daardie rigting. Ons glo dat
die nodige effektiwiteit en vaartbelyning hierdeur aan Eskom gebied sal
word, ook om wêreldwyd kompeterend te wees. Die AEB staan vir 'n kleiner en
meer vaartbelynde regering en privatisering, maar ons neem kennis van en
ons het begrip daarvoor dat die staat hier die alleen-aandeelhouer is, want
elektrisiteit is 'n strategies kritieke kommoditeit. Ons begryp dit ten
volle. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairman, the AEB supports sound business principles. This
legislation which converts Eskom from a statutory body into a public
company is a positive step in that direction. We believe that this will
give Eskom the necessary effectiveness and streamlining, and will also
enable it to be competitive worldwide. The AEB supports a smaller, more
streamlined Government and privatisation, but we note and understand that
in this case the state is the sole shareholder, because electricity is a
strategically critical commodity. We fully understand that.]

Eskom's track record on nondiscrimination, however, is not good. Complaints
of language discrimination against Afrikaans have been upheld by PanSALB,
and at present a complaint by the MW solidarity that certain employee
benefits are selectively granted is running.

Finally, I propose as an amendment that the Bill makes provision that if
the hon Van Jaarsveld again exceeds his time, Eskom can cut the
electricity. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Chairperson and hon members, there was
a moment when I was not sure in which debate I was participating,
especially because of the opportunistic attacks on Cosatu and the SACP by
Mr Van Jaarsveld.

I want to assure him and the opposition that those attacks will get them
nowhere, because the ANC-led alliance is much larger than the opposition's
petty politics. The alliance is not a Jericho. Its walls will not fall, no
matter how loudly Mr Van Jaarsveld shouts. [Applause.]

However, seeing that all of us in this House are singing from the same hymn
book, except for the ACDP, I think all that remains for me to say is amen
to this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.
The House adjourned at 17:25.
