                      TOURISM IN KOUGA AND EASTERN CAPE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -
       (a)  this 27th day of September is World Tourism Day;


       (b)  in the Eastern Cape, the Kouga region, which is the area between
           the Nelson Mandela Metro and the Blaauwkrans Bridge   and  which
           must not be confused with the Coega development,  east  of  Port
           Elizabeth, is where the highest number of tourists, both foreign
           and local, commute;


       (c)  at present, an estimated 800 000 tourists commute  through  this
           region on their travels between Port Elizabeth and Cape Town;


       (d)  very few of these tourists explore the rest of the Eastern  Cape
           for a variety of reasons, inter alia the safety risk; and


       (e)  funding is required to develop the potential of tourism  in  the
           Eastern Cape; and
  (2) calls on the Minister of Environmental Affairs and  Tourism  to  look
       into this important matter.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

 VIOLENT ACTION THREATENED BY USA, PLEA FOR RECONCILIATION AND CONDEMNATION
                                OF TERRORISM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) gravely observes the growing intimidation of God's people  throughout
       the world by threats of the  USA  through  the  same  terrorism  that
       killed thousands in North America on 11 September 2001;


  (2) notes that the world continues to be involved in ardent  navel-gazing
       and twiddling of thumbs while God's people get killed in  the  Middle
       East;


  (3) urges the USA to desist from this callous action and to rather  fight
       ideas of terrorism with alternative  ideas  that  turn  enemies  into
       friends;


  (4) notes that we are working together with our adversaries, who are  not
       our enemies, and that we gave them leadership positions as we  strive
       to be one family;


  (5) notes that the whole world is tired of violence and wars; and


  (6) commits itself to abhor and condemn terrorism  everywhere  no  matter
       where it occurs or who does it.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to the motion? There  is
an objection. The motion will therefore become notice of a motion.

                       PROUDLY SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGN

           purchase quality South African goods;


       (b)  the Proudly South African label will be a guarantee of adherence
           to fair labour and environmental standards; and


       (c)  by exercising the choice to purchase goods bearing  the  Proudly
           South African mark, members of  the  public  can  contribute  to
           promoting economic growth, job creation and poverty  alleviation
           in the country;


  (3) wishes the Proudly South African campaign well;


  (4) calls on all members of Parliament to actively support  the  campaign
       and do whatever they can to publicise it; and


  (5) calls on the Government and parliamentary structures to do  all  that
       they can to ensure that procurement decisions take due cognisance  of
       this campaign.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                         DEPUTY PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Chairperson, hon premiers, hon members of  the  House,
in late 1948, as a little boy of less than 10 years, I used to hear  a  song
which was popular at the time, with lyrics that went:  ``Imithetho  kaMalan,
isiphethe nzima, asazi la sofela khona.'' [Malan's laws are tough on us;  we
do not know where we will die.]

One day I asked my maternal grandmother who this Malan was, and she said:


  uMalan uhulumeni, indoda enkulu emhlophe, efaka amaklesibhande, ehlala le
  ePitoli. [Malan is the government, a big white man who wears  braces  and
  who lives in Pretoria.]

My grandmother's response was no different from that of  millions  of  other
black South Africans who were excluded from  the  political  system  by  the
apartheid government. Those who lived at the time would remember that  often
people viewed the government not as  their  own  or  their  friend,  but  as
somebody who came to cause problems for them, who oppressed them.  They  had
never seen this person and therefore the imagination visualised  a  powerful
person somewhere in Pretoria. Everybody would say that  that  was  what  the
government in Pretoria had said.

Given this background, as the first democratic government of  this  country,
we had a historic mandate and a duty to bring  about  dramatic  and  visible
change to the concept of government and governance.

We had to establish a government of the people, one that all South  Africans
could relate to and understand. This government had to be brought closer  to
the people. We had to formulate and implement programmes that  would  ensure
that  government  improved  the  quality  of  lives  and  reduced   poverty,
inequality and vulnerability.

We faced immense challenges, but,  through  co-operative  governance,  built
the necessary institutional capacity, formulated and implemented a range  of
policies, and strengthened our financial management systems.

Section 41 of  the  Constitution  spells  out  the  notion  of  co-operative
governance. The crux of this section states that all spheres  of  government
and all organs of the state must assist and support each other.

We are proud of the fact that, in just a few years,  we  have  succeeded  in
changing the face of our government  and  the  manner  in  which  government
conducts its business. We have done this in ways  that  very  few  countries
have achieved in decades of democratic rule.

We strongly believe in our mission of bringing government closer to all  our
people, in particular the poorest of the poor. In this regard, we  abolished
the four provinces which had been established in  1910,  and  replaced  them
with nine provinces and nine provincial governments.

This was aimed at ensuring wider participation of people  in  the  governing
of their lives,  and  to  allow  for  greater  access  to  government.  This
establishment of more than one sphere of government was to lay the basis  of
co-operative governance. I am pleased to address this House on  this  topic.
As  you  are  all  aware,  the  NCOP  forms  the  backbone  of  co-operative
governance, as  the  only  structure  that  brings  together  the  national,
provincial and local spheres of government in one chamber.

The direct involvement of organised local government and  special  delegates
from the provincial legislatures in the affairs of  this  House  means  that
this House has its ear to the ground.

I am also aware that this House recently held a workshop  on  improving  co-
operative governance, in which a number of questions were  debated.  I  look
forward to reading the final report of the workshop with interest.

It is our well-considered  view  that  co-operative  governance  facilitates
creative  and  crosscutting  thinking  on  policy  issues.  It  also   makes
government more effective and efficient, as it allows for integrated  policy
development,  prioritisation,  planning,   execution   and   evaluation   of
Government programmes.

At the executive level, co-operative governance is no longer  a  theory  but
daily practice. Members are aware of the formation of  the  Cabinet  cluster
system, which effectively compressed 26 Ministries into six  clusters.  This
system is replicated at the level of director-general, through the Forum  of
Directors-General, which is also attended by the nine provincial  directors-
general.

Co-operative governance between  the  national  and  provincial  spheres  is
further facilitated through the  President's  Co-ordinating  Council,  which
brings together the President and premiers  to  discuss  matters  of  mutual
concern.

In addition, Ministers, whose area of  responsibility  includes  matters  of
provincial competence, meet with members of  provincial  executive  councils
to ensure collective discussion on both the development  and  implementation
of policy.

Our last leg in the democratisation process  was  the  finalisation  of  the
local government sphere in December  2000.  This  truly  brought  the  ``big
man''  sitting  in  Pretoria  to  people's  back  yards.  This  has   indeed
demystified the ``big man'' and made people realise that government is  part
of their daily lives and is made up of ordinary men and  women  coming  from
within their own communities.

As my compatriots in  this  Chamber  know,  the  ability  of  Government  to
deliver depends on how it plans  and  manages  its  finances.  To  ensure  a
properly functioning intergovernmental system,  the  Government  has  passed
enabling legislation and put in place  the  necessary  financial  management
systems.

We have established the Budget Council, which comprises  representatives  of
national and  provincial  government  and  which  makes  recommendations  on
provincial allocations. We have also established  the  Budget  Forum,  which
includes  representatives  of  all  three  spheres  and   considers   budget
allocations for local government.

Furthermore, there is a financial and  fiscal  commission  tasked  with  the
role of ensuring  equity  in  the  division  of  nationally  raised  revenue
between the spheres and within each sphere.

It is pleasing to note that significant successes have been achieved in  the
area of financial management and budget reform. In 1998, the Budget  Council
oversaw the introduction of the three-year rolling budgets, the  Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework.

This, together with improved political oversight and the  early  publication
of the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, has  enhanced  the  transparency
of the intergovernmental fiscal system and has facilitated better  alignment
between policy and budgets.

This is not to suggest that the process has been smooth. But,  in  instances
where problems arose, we were quick in finding good  and  lasting  solutions
and were decisive in implementing them.

For example, in  the  1997-98  financial  year,  provinces  ran  a  combined
deficit of R5,4 billion. Through co-operative governance  we  were  able  to
turn the deficit into a surplus of R0,6 billion by the next financial year.

A further monitoring tool we have  now  put  in  place  through  the  Public
Finance Management Act is a statutory  obligation  on  all  departments  and
provinces to report on the state of their finances at  least  every  quarter
so that  we  can  identify  potential  problems  before  they  reach  crisis
proportions.

Details on improvements in financial  management  at  provincial  and  local
government levels are contained in the intergovernmental review of 1999  and
2000. The year's review, as hon members  know,  will  be  released  in  this
House early next month.

I  am  informed  that  the  NCOP  is  intending  to  conduct  an   intensive
examination of the review involving representatives of all three spheres  of
government.

In bringing government to the people  and  ensuring  co-ordination  and  co-
operation among the three spheres, we are able to improve  service  delivery
and ensure that delivery points are brought closer to the people.

We are proud that some residents of remote rural villages now receive  basic
services such as welfare grants and can apply for birth, death and  identity
documents in their own villages without having to travel long distances.
This has been done through the Government's multipurpose  community  centre,
or MPCC, programme. The  multipurpose  community  centre  programmes  are  a
collaboration  between  different  government  departments  and  have  truly
brought government to the people in a manner unthinkable before 1994.

There  are  already  a  number  of  multipurpose  community  centre  success
stories. As of this July,  10 000  birth  certificates  and  5 000  identity
documents have been issued at the Tombo MPCC near Port St Johns,  which  was
launched in December 1999. We  are  also  informed  that  approximately  200
people visit the Namahadi MPCC in QwaQwa daily.

A real test of our intergovernmental system usually comes  during  times  of
disaster, as it did during the 1999-2000  financial  year.  All  spheres  of
government came together  and  worked  out  a  strategy  to  fund  emergency
reconstruction and implemented relief and rescue programmes.  An  additional
amount of R895 million was allocated to provincial governments last year  in
support of their disaster relief programmes.
Further amounts of R600 million in 2001-02,  R400  million  in  2002-03  and
R200 million in 2003-04 have been set aside for provinces  to  complete  the
reconstruction process.

Another example of successful co-ordination was  in  the  combating  of  the
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and  the  cholera  outbreak  in  KwaZulu-
Natal. The co-operation of  the  different  spheres  of  government  ensured
success in containing these epidemics.

Members  of  the  House  would  be  aware  of  the  Government's  Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Programme,  which  is  also  premised  on  the
ongoing interaction  of  all  three  spheres  of  government.  This  is  one
programme that requires the full attention of this House, as it  will  bring
about visible transformation in the countryside.

While we are pleased with our successes thus far, we are  aware  that  there
are challenges remaining.

The nine provinces created out of the ruins of the apartheid  infrastructure
no doubt had teething problems initially. These  have  been  dealt  with  as
shown in the financial turnaround mentioned earlier.

It is to be expected that there will be  similar  problems  with  the  newly
created democratic local government structures. However,  we  are  confident
that we will face these challenges head-on.

The successful delivery of services  to  the  people  also  depends  on  the
dedication of our public servants. I am saying this at the appropriate  time
as this week is Public Service Week. This week's  theme,  ``I  am  proud  to
serve you'', encapsulates our attitude as Government to the public  that  we
serve. We need a Public Service that is  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the
people in the spirit of  Batho  Pele,  to  ensure  effective  and  efficient
delivery of services. Public servants should be ready and prepared to  serve
with respect, humility and courtesy at all times.

Let me reiterate that  we  are  determined  as  Government  to  improve  the
conditions of the poorest of the poor in our country  and  ensure  a  better
life for all South Africans.  Our  commitment  to  achieving  this  goal  is
unwavering, and our track record speaks for itself.  The  Government  cannot
be accused that its policies are a deviation from  serving  the  poorest  of
the poor. I am referring,  in  particular,  to  our  economic  policies  and
programmes.

Anyone who wishes to challenge the Government's programmes  must  check  his
or her facts thoroughly. It is of even greater concern  if  the  accusations
are made by those who purport to speak on behalf of the poor.

Most of the accusations have come from people who have been  reflecting  the
interests of their narrow sectors and ignoring the bigger  picture.  On  the
other hand, as Government, we have to ensure that we serve the interests  of
all sectors, and not one sector.

What we need from everyone, in the spirit of democracy, transparency and co-
operation, are constructive suggestions that will enhance  the  delivery  of
Government's programmes.

The establishment of representative institutions,  such  as  the  NCOP,  was
something that was well thought out.  These  institutions  help  extend  the
participation of the people in the exercise of power.  We  need  to  enhance
and enrich them for the sake  of  our  people.  This  House  has  a  serious
responsibility in the manner in which it works. It must continuously  remind
us about the correct decisions we took in the  past  in  establishing  these
institutions.

Democracy may be expensive and  time-consuming,  but  it  helps  to  prevent
autocratic and dictatorial tendencies. It stops a  few  people  taking  ill-
considered decisions that adversely affect the lives of the  majority.  This
House is well placed to ensure that power is exercised fairly  and  properly
in all spheres of Government.

We have come a long way since 1994 and, together with  all  South  Africans,
we can ensure that South Africa ranks amongst the greatest  nations  of  the
world.

In closing, let me convey a  message  from  the  Minister  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism, who said that I should remind this House that today  is
World Tourism Day. Fortunately, we have been out there in the lobby,  and  I
am sure that the House is very conscious of it, and that we  should  reflect
on how we can continue to promote our wonderful country. We must be part  of
changing the ``big white man'' to an ordinary person. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Having welcomed the Deputy President,  I
should now proceed to welcome all the special delegates from  the  provinces
who have joined us for this debate.

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, permanent and special delegates to the  NCOP,  it
is my pleasure once again to warmly welcome the Deputy  President,  the  hon
Mr Jacob Zuma, to this House. I would also like to take this opportunity  to
extend our greetings  to  our  premiers  from  the  various  provinces,  and
members of the Cabinet who may be with us this afternoon.

Tuesday, 9 October 2001, is cause for celebration for  all  NCOP  activists.
It is a cause for celebration precisely because to  us  it  is  seen  as  an
occasion of importance for members of this House who, together with  members
of Cabinet, have actively engaged their energies in securing  the  right  to
table the 2001 Intergovernmental Fiscal Review in the House.

As members would know, the previous  two  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Reviews
were not tabled in the manner in which  it  is  being  done  now,  which  is
basically a major achievement for the NCOP.

As members of the NCOP, we are of the view that the  NCOP,  this  House,  is
the correct place  for  tabling  the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review.  As
members would know, Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Reviews  outline  the  fiscal
framework that  informs  the  division  of  resources  between  the  various
spheres of government, of which in this case there are three. They  lay  out
the division of resources between and within the spheres of  government  and
summarise projected spending trends over the next three years.

The Intergovernmental Fiscal Review  becomes  the  document  that  seeks  to
provide a snapshot of how intergovernmental fiscal relations  are  currently
evolving,  highlighting  the  successes  and  the  shortcomings.   It   also
indicates the variances that exist between provinces and municipalities.

An interesting feature, therefore, of the forthcoming  review  will  be  the
simultaneous release of nonfinancial performance indicators of  money  spent
on key sectors, such as welfare, education and health. This will  also  make
key distinctions between output and outcomes of financial  expenditure.  The
key emphasis, in terms of the forthcoming fiscal  review,  will  be  on  the
monitoring of performance of nonfinancial indicators. This distinction  will
be a key instrument in  assessing  the  progress  of  our  fight  to  reduce
poverty in South Africa. It may be fine for us to  say,  for  example,  that
hundreds of thousands will be spend by provinces on education  in  the  next
financial year, but the key question ought to  be  whether  this  additional
spending will result in a higher number of learners obtaining  matriculation
certificates, whether more preschool children  will  have  access  to  early
childhood education or  whether  a  larger  population  of  learners  become
computer literate.

The 2001 Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review  will  break  new  ground  in  the
evolution of intergovernmental fiscal relations, and we are proud that  this
epoch-making document will be tabled in this House, as I have mentioned,  on
9 October 2001.

In this light I would appeal to hon members of this House to participate  in
the  public  hearings  on  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  which  will
commence on 10 October  2001.  A  special  request  is  therefore  made  for
increased participation, particularly in the social sectors.  The  education
component of the public hearings will be held  on  12  October,  the  health
component on 16 October and the social development component on 12 October.

May I also take this opportunity to mention a few successes which  the  NCOP
has had in  this  area.  Of  particular  relevance  and  importance  is  the
initiative of the Select Committee on Finance, under  the  guidance  of  the
chairperson - Chief Whip of the Council - and, indeed, the  other  presiding
officers. This accorded us the opportunity to  be  able  to  conduct  public
hearings in the various provinces during  August  this  year;  to  begin  to
interrogate  together  with   provinces,   and   other   stakeholders,   the
recommendations  of  the  Financial  and  Fiscal  Commission.  These  public
hearings awarded the committee, together with the FFC,  an  opportunity  for
the FFC to be able to formally share its recommendation on the  division  of
nationally  raised  revenue  to  the  provincial  legislatures   and   their
counterparts in local government.

One would know that the FFC has in the past never made such  recommendations
directly to the provinces and local government. This exercise also  assisted
us  in  terms  of  ensuring  that,  indeed,   there   was   greater   public
participation, which participation, basically, was  taken  to  new  heights.
Only the NCOP with its unique institutional  features  has  the  ability  to
intensify and accelerate such public participation.

More importantly, regarding the provincial equitable share, we also had  the
opportunity, together with the FFC, to be able to engage  provinces  further
in the kind of work they have been doing and in  beginning  to  explain  the
formula which the FFC is now using. The formula is based on the averages  of
the school-age population, the proportion of the population  without  access
to medical aid funding, the elderly, the disabled, and the province's  share
of the total population of the country. In the  case  of  local  government,
the formula is also based on a number of households below the poverty  level
for each local authority.

In this light, I would like to appeal  to  all  elected  representatives  to
ensure that citizens residing in their constituencies are counted on  census
day. This would ensure that the kinds of  approaches  we  have  adopted,  in
terms of accelerating the pace of transformation in this  country,  are  not
hampered by lack of data, which, in many ways, will  have  precarious  cost-
raising implications. We may  have  the  best  policies  and  programmes  to
achieve our social and economic objectives, but if we do not  have  reliable
data, the poor will not have access, basically,  to  much-needed  resources.
Such policies, whatever they  may  be,  will  then  be  meaningless  to  the
majority of our people.

We therefore appeal to each  and  every  citizen  of  this  country  to  get
counted on census day. Could I also take  this  opportunity  to  make  quick
references to the way forward, as we see it, basically at the level  of  the
committee and, indeed, at the level of the NCOP. Continual  discussions,  as
hon members would know, are ongoing in terms of how best we can  expand  our
oversight role as the NCOP. I will therefore make some brief  comments  with
reference to the kind of oversight role we should play  as  a  committee  in
respect of finance.

Perhaps we in the NCOP should not duplicate the oversight function with  our
counterparts  in  the  National  Assembly.  The  NCOP  should  not  exercise
oversight over national institutions, as the point has been made  from  time
to time. We ought to oversee  the  budget  to  ensure  that  provincial  and
municipal interests are properly accommodated  and  that  the  division,  in
respect of revenue, is shared equitably amongst provinces.

The separate tabling of the Division of Revenue Bill  from  the  tabling  of
the national Budget could also expand the oversight role of the NCOP.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE NORTHERN CAPE (Mr E M Dipico): Chairperson of  the  NCOP,
Deputy Chairpersons, hon Deputy President, hon members  and  colleagues,  it
is indeed a great privilege and honour for me to be part of  this  important
gathering,  to  focus  on  intergovernmental  relations   and   co-operative
governance in  our  country,  flowing  from  the  1999  and  2000  national,
provincial and local government election mandates to the  elected  officials
in our respective provinces. We have committed the entire  province  of  the
Northern Cape, its organs of government and civil society,  to  striving  to
realise the goals and objectives of a better life for all our people.

The provincial government has, during the first  quarter  of  2001,  engaged
the entire  district,  local  municipalities,  mayors  and  chief  executive
officers and approved the revised integrated provincial strategy  for  2001-
04, with the resolutions of the national lekgotla involving 11 themes.

As a  result  of  this,  the  MEC  mayoral  forum  meets  monthly  with  the
provincial MEC for housing and local government, who, in  turn,  reports  to
the clusters - the social  cluster,  the  economic  cluster  and  the  joint
cluster of the executive council  respectively  -  on  matters  relating  to
local integrated growth and  development,  as  well  as  on  addressing  the
glaring inequalities in our  society  and  taking  the  necessary  steps  to
eradicate poverty and other social ills, in order to ensure that our  people
are afforded the dignity they deserve.

As  reported  at  the   last   Presidential   Co-ordinating   Council,   the
transformation of local government in the province is on track, and the  IDP
processes are well advanced. A meeting between the  Northern  Cape  and  the
North West will be held on the second of next month to  discuss  the  future
and how to manage the cross-border municipality  of  Kgalagadi,  noting  the
complexities we are going through.

Indeed, the launching of the Kgalagadi nodal rural area is  a  challenge  to
us to ensure that  all  the  departments,  national,  provincial  and  local
government,  including  the  district  councils,  can  throw  their  budgets
together to ensure that we create success in that  area.  We  hope  that  we
will be able to make a difference in the lives of those people who  are  the
poorest of the poor in our country.

One of the very good exercises that we have been  going  through  and  which
has worked for our province has  been  ``The  cabinet  meets  the  people'',
which continues every second week. On Wednesdays the  cabinet  moves  around
the province, going to rural areas and faraway places. A fortnight  ago  all
MECs and heads of  the  departments  were  in  Leliefontein.  We  call  upon
regional office heads, from minerals and energy, water, etc, to join us  and
sit with municipalities, district councils and the people in those areas  to
address the issues affecting  those  people  for  the  whole  day  and  find
resolutions to the problems and look into implementation. We  have  seen  it
working. It has produced major  results  in  areas  that  we  visited,  like
Riemvasmaak, Schmidtsrift and a number of other rural areas.  We  have  seen
immense potential from the resources from all other departments.

I  would  like  to  tell  the  Deputy  President  that  we  did  not  choose
Leliefontein in the Richtersveld as a coincidence. We chose it because  this
period is the tourism  month  and  flower  season.  When  one  goes  to  the
exhibition one will see the Northern  Cape,  with  the  flowers  blossoming.
[Laughter.] We are attracting everybody to come and  look  at  a  carpet  of
flowers of different colours stretching more  than  500  km  -  a  beautiful
area! If hon members have not been there, I wish that they would go  to  the
Richtersveld in  order  to  know  their  country.  Leliefontein  is  not  in
Zimbabwe but it is in the Northern Cape,  in  South  Africa.  [Laughter.]  I
hope that hon members will be able to join  us  when  we  go  out  to  those
areas.

Another area which has worked, particularly regarding co-ordination, is  the
one that we have mentioned: one-stop services which started in the  Northern
Cape three years ago. We have launched these  one-stop  service  centres  in
Augrabies, Pescodia and Galeshewe, and the services rendered  in  a  package
under one roof are immense. They cater for all the departments, from  people
who want to apply for death and birth certificates, and licences, to  people
who want to pay for their services like electricity.  There  is  a  one-stop
service next to the Deputy President's constituency office in Galeshewe,  in
the Northern Cape, which also caters for those who want to get  married.  It
creates a beehive of activity, because people do not  go  to  town  to  Home
Affairs' magistrates, but use the one-stop services and  marry  very  nicely
without any problems. [Laughter.] That is what we  want  to  see.  Everybody
who goes there gets a service from the Department  of  Labour,  municipality
service, Home Affairs and all other services. We do get information for  the
people who use those centres in the rural areas.

Indeed, we believe that proper co-ordination is working to  roll  out  these
one-stop services throughout, and others will be launched by  the  President
in two months in Colesberg and we hope that other  areas  will  be  able  to
benefit from this integrated approach.

In order to enhance the ongoing  streamlining  of  interaction  between  the
three spheres of  government,  it  is  thus  both  a  constitutional  and  a
practical necessity to restructure  the  flow  of  information  between  the
various national, legislative and executive structures. There is a  need  to
ensure that co-ordination is well  structured,  particularly  with  the  new
local government structures which need  to  be  assisted  by  the  provinces
where messages go straight to them, and at  times  provinces  cannot  assist
and give the necessary support if they  are  not  notified  by  the  various
departments from the national Government.

Another area which we have seen working is with regard to crime  prevention.
We have launched the crime prevention committee, which is led by  the  judge
president in the province, where  broader  correctional  services,  defence,
safety  and  security,  the  judiciary,  welfare,  education,   health   and
economics  departments  are   working   together.   We   also   brought   in
municipalities and the private  sector,  particularly  insurance  companies.
That has brought the situation under control  in  Galeshewe.  The  President
highlighted the crime rate in Galeshewe and the okapi knives that  are  also
used in the USA. We  understand  them  much  better  in  the  Northern  Cape
because they have a history in the province.

We are dealing with that matter  and  making  a  difference  in  that  area,
because it is not only a matter of crime,  but  also  one  of  looking  into
underlying problems. We have seen the private  sector  contributing  to  the
installation of cameras throughout the  CBD,  buying  new  bakkies  for  the
police and paying for the call centres  throughout  Pescodia  and  Galeshewe
where  people  press  for  emergency  services  rather  than   running   for
telephones. It has  worked  because  we  can  respond  very  fast  to  those
matters.

Our  provincial   government   is   currently   well   advanced   with   the
implementation of its integrated and coherent approach of  service  delivery
to the people. It has been  organised  in  a  manner  that  focuses  on  the
strengths of Government in a more collective way. The executive council  and
the heads of departments have realigned  their  activities  to  clusters  to
ensure that priorities are implemented in such a manner  so  as  to  achieve
national and provincial benchmarks.

The clusters which have been operating from 1999  are  the  social  cluster,
which involves education, health, social welfare, safety, liaison,  housing,
arts,  sports  and  culture;  the  economic  cluster,  comprising   economic
affairs, tourism, transport, public works, agriculture, nature  conservation
and environmental affairs, and finance; and the joint cluster,  which  deals
with all the matters which cut across, and is chaired by the premier in  the
cabinet.

The policy and planning unit, which is located in the premier's  office  and
includes  intergovernmental  relations,  has  been  mandated   to   optimise
alignment among the various  strategic  planning,  budgeting  and  decision-
making processes that take place in Government.

Effective co-ordination of the activities between national,  provincial  and
local governments is directed via the cabinet office. The  premier  together
with  the  director-general  ensure  that  reporting  is  done  through  the
technical committee for the President's co-ordinating council  on  achieving
Government's strategic  objectives.  Such  interactive  forms  of  decision-
making and  service  delivery  will  undoubtedly  continue  to  promote  co-
operative governance and intergovernmental relations between the spheres  of
government.

I believe that as we seek to achieve the reconstruction and  development  of
our society we must foster a spirit of mutual  co-operation,  co-ordination,
impact assessment and evaluation, not only among spheres of government,  but
also among our people. I agree with  the  Deputy  President  that  when  the
people talk about this big person, we should demystify  this  big  baba  and
show them that we, as  Government,  belong  to  them.  I  hope  that  as  we
continue doing that we are in a position  to  get  the  stories  which  were
heard many years ago, and are seen to be able  to  deal  with  our  problems
without failing our people.

In conclusion, allow me also to extend my  heartfelt  appreciation  for  the
support which the Northern Cape government has been receiving, including co-
operation from the various national departments  and  the  Presidency.  With
the limited resources we have, we have been able to make headway.

We have made progress as far  as  improving  service  delivery,  growth  and
development is concerned, and have ensured that all  agencies  are  able  to
optimise what they do in their respective areas of work, as well as  in  the
province and their local areas. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE FREE STATE (Ms  I  W  Direko):  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy
President, hon Premiers, hon members of the NCOP and colleagues,  it  always
takes me down memory lane when I visit this House, having been a  member  of
this  respectable,  august  House.  No  premier   understands   better   ...
[Laughter.][Applause.] ... what a dynamic House this is. We  are  second  to
none in the NCOP.

The Constitution establishes norms of co-operative governance in  which  the
various  spheres  of  governance   are   distinctive,   interdependent   and
interrelated. The Constitution spells out clearly that no man is  an  island
in governance. In  pursuit  of  this  distinctiveness,  interdependence  and
interrelatedness, I wish to focus on  our  contribution  as  a  province  in
building a more co-operative and prosperous South Africa.

The co-operation between the various spheres of  government  is  central  to
the realisation of the agenda  of  reconstruction  and  development  of  the
country,  as  well  as  the  achievement  of  a  nonracial,  nonsexist   and
democratic society. I am pleased, therefore, to indicate that  our  province
participates  with  great  interest  and  commitment  in  the  key  national
Intergovernmental Relations Forum established by  the  national  Government.
We think this is necessary if we are to realise the founding provisions  and
principles of the Constitution.

The  relationship  between  the  provincial  executive   council   and   the
provincial legislature is very sound, and  our  challenge  remains  the  co-
ordination of activities between our NCOP representatives,  the  legislature
and local government to ensure effective  co-ordination  for  the  province.
There is no way the right can go on doing a, b, c and d when the  left  does
not know what the right is doing.

It is also important to continue to strive for the better  co-ordination  of
activities and decisions made by the three spheres of  governance.  This  is
particularly important where decisions made  at  one  sphere  of  governance
have  financial  and  administrative  implications  for  another  sphere  of
governance.  It  is  desirable  that  when  this   happens   the   necessary
consultation must take place.

It was a robust step on the part  of  the  Government  to  reorganise  local
government. It is therefore important  that  making  this  third  sphere  of
government work is approached in  a  robust  manner.  That  is  why  working
together becomes so critically important.

In  order  to  improve  co-ordination  and  to  ensure  that  the  necessary
consultation takes place between the provincial and  local  governments,  we
have established a provincial and local government forum, which we refer  to
as  Provloc.  Provloc  simply  means  monthly  meetings  between  the  local
government and the provincial government so that we move  forward  together.
While this forum is still at its initial stages, it has a good potential  to
improve relations between the provincial and local governments.

If people on the ground must benefit from us in the province  and  those  at
local  government,  we  must  of  necessity  work  together.  We   are   not
representing  ourselves  there,  but  the  people.  The   people   are   the
beneficiaries of both spheres of government, and if we have to deliver  what
the people expect from us, then it is  critically  important  that  we  work
together as a team.

In addition, we meet regularly with executive mayors to  discuss  issues  of
mutual interest and the need for an integrated approach  to  development  in
the province. The mayors - I did see one or two mayors  around  here  -  are
critical to the success of local government. It is important that we in  the
province move along  with  them,  and  that  we  come  together  monthly  to
identify problems. No two areas are the same. Fundamentally the  differences
are the same, but there  are  particular  problems  that  exist  in  various
municipalities that are not the same. When we  get  together  we  can  solve
each other's problems. That is why we also have this mayoral platform.

The above-mentioned  co-operation  assisted  the  province  to  develop  and
finalise its integrated development plan. The province now has  a  draft  of
this plan. It contains not  only  provincial  input,  but  also  input  from
municipalities, so that when we go to the people and say that  this  is  the
integrated development plan of the Free State, it is, indeed, a  Free  State
development plan, which is informed by the  interim  integrated  development
plans of municipalities.

Our measurement of the success of co-operative  governance  has  to  be  the
substance of our integrated development plans, which will  be  finalised  by
March 2002. The challenge is for national  departments  to  join  provincial
and local governments in making those plans effective.
The process of implementing the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural  Development
Strategy is also a practical way to move  intergovernmental  relations  from
rhetoric  to  real  co-operation.  People  are  tired  of  talk.  They  need
delivery. It is  important  that  we  as  leaders,  in  whatever  sphere  of
government, recognise that need. Our people down there need hope. They  need
to be given hope. It is only by working  together  that  we  can  give  them
hope.

This process has forced us to look at how we work and  seek  to  change  the
fragmented  ways  that  bedevil  our   ability   to   implement   Government
programmes. There are good Government programmes; it is our strategies  that
we need to spruce up to be able to deliver to the masses.

Good governance in our province has  provided  us  with  an  opportunity  to
establish strategic partnerships with, amongst other things,  the  house  of
traditional leaders. We get on very well with our traditional leaders.

Ek weet nie of die Khoikhoi saamwerk nie, maar  in  die  Vrystaat  werk  ons
saam. [Gelag.] [I do not know if the KhoiKhoi are co-operating, but  in  the
Free State we are working together. [Laughter.]]

They  are  after  all,  the  people's  leaders.  They  must  be  given   the
recognition they deserve, and one gives them  recognition  by  working  with
them. [Interjections.]

Regarding religious leaders, we had a very good seminar of  1 300  religious
leaders who came together at a  conference  organised  by  themselves.  From
that conference has emerged a permanent structure, which includes  business,
religious leaders and agricultural unions across the board.  That  religious
body has produced an integrated forum of  everybody  who  is  interested  in
seeing the Free State make progress.

By the way, we are working on a new Free State. We are  producing  new  Free
Staters to be able to produce a Free State  which  becomes  a  force  to  be
reckoned with. [Interjections.]
Ons sal nie terugstaan vir die groot plekke  nie.  [Gelag.]  [Applous.]  [We
will not stand back for the bigger places. [Laughter.] [Applause.]]

We also have regular meetings with the farming  communities.  Through  these
partnerships we  have  recorded  successes  with  regard  to  HIV/Aids.  The
farmers,  the  religious  leaders,  communities  in  the  rural  areas  come
together because, I would like to say to Comrade Deputy  President,  we  now
have our district Aids councils that include everybody,  particularly  those
in the rural areas.

We have achieved all  the  above,  because  of  our  commitment  to  solving
problems and challenges through co-operative and peaceful means provided  by
our country's Constitution. Next year, at this time, I would like to say  to
Comrade Deputy President, we will be able to report more progress. But,  for
the moment, we  are  strong  enough  to  challenge  anybody,  including  the
diamond province. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  members,  I  did  not  note  the
strong presence of representatives of  organised  local  government  in  the
House today, so we welcome Salga representatives to the House. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF GAUTENG (Mr M S Shilowa): Chairperson and Deputy  Chairperson
of the NCOP, Deputy President of the Republic,  hon  members,  the  teacher,
principal and recently professor, I understand, is a  hard  act  to  follow.
[Laughter.]

From the input of the Deputy President, it is clear that we  are  discussing
our  system  of  governance  not  because  we  doubt  its  correctness   and
appropriateness. The purpose of the debate is to find ways and means to  co-
operation and co-ordination among the three spheres of government to  ensure
that they function effectively for  the  benefit  of  the  people  of  South
Africa.

Since the Constitution came into force  both  the  national  and  provincial
spheres of government have had time to grow, clarify their roles and  create
the necessary capacity to fulfil their obligations  and  functions.  We  now
have new municipal structures, some of which are  still  going  through  the
similar growing process that the other spheres had to go through.

A challenge for all of us, as we look at how  we  can  enhance  co-operation
among the three spheres, is to  assist  this  newly  established  sphere  of
government in its growing  phase  and  ensure  that  it  has  the  necessary
capacity to fulfil its obligations and functions.

In Gauteng we have already started a process of working  together  with  all
municipalities to ensure  that  they  go  through  the  growing  phase  much
quicker and create the necessary capacity to  serve  their  communities.  Of
the six metropolitan areas in the country, three  are  located  in  Gauteng.
The viability of the country's economy ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Premier, I wonder if I could ask you  to
move to the microphone directly behind you. It seems we have a problem  with
the microphones owing to our ceiling being  over  100  years  old  and  very
leaky.

The PREMIER OF GAUTENG (Mr M S Shilowa): Thank you very  much,  Chairperson.
In my previous job, if such things happened, I would simply  have  organised
a walkout. [Laughter.]

I was saying, hon Chairperson, that of the six  metropolitan  areas  in  the
country, three are located  in  Gauteng.  The  viability  of  the  country's
economy is linked to the success of these municipalities. As the  provincial
government,  we  therefore  have  a  duty,   working   together   with   the
municipalities, to ensure that the economic growth potential in these  areas
is fully exploited.

We also have three district councils  that  bring  together  key  towns  and
cities in the province. Over  the  past  year  we  appointed  transformation
managers to help transform these municipalities into centres  of  excellence
in service delivery. Together with the national  Government,  we  have  also
assisted in building the capacity of councillors and officials.
We have set aside resources to enhance the viability and  sustainability  of
these new municipalities. We are currently finalising the  establishment  of
the  municipal  institutional  support  centre   to   assist   with   change
management, development of new financial systems, debt control  and  revenue
generation, building  treasury  capacity  in  municipalities,  and  creating
effective municipalities.

The last Gauteng intergovernmental forum meeting also agreed on a  range  of
measures aimed at strengthening the capacity  of  local  government  and  on
working together to ensure the effective  delivery  of  services,  including
the provision of minimum amounts of  free  water  and  electricity,  and  on
improving the billing system.

As part of our efforts to align policies of all spheres  of  government  for
effective  economic  growth,  development  and  service  delivery,  we  have
examined  integrated  development  plans  of  various   municipalities   and
suggested ways  and  means  in  which  they  can  be  linked  to  provincial
strategies and plans.

One of the challenges we face  in  the  province  is  that  of  cross-border
municipalities. This challenge is how to provide  uniform  quality  services
across provincial boundaries. Together with the  provincial  governments  of
Mpumalanga and the North West, we will continue to look  at  effective  ways
to manage cross-border municipalities in ways that  are  beneficial  to  the
citizens of the respective provinces.

We would want to suggest that  the  NCOP  visit  some  of  our  cross-border
municipalities to see how they are functioning to ensure that  no  province,
ourselves included, abdicates its responsibility or dumps it  on  the  other
province, particularly in areas that are not shared  responsibilities,  such
as health, education, housing and roads.

Together with national and local government, we need to find a response,  in
a multidisciplinary way, to the  fact  that  an  estimated  25%  of  Gauteng
households do not yet have access  to  waterborne  sewerage,  clean  running
water and electricity. We are currently working on  a  plan  to  ensure  the
provision of these basic services to all Gauteng residents within  the  next
three years. However, its success will rely  on  the  extent  of  the  close
working relationship and joint planning by all three spheres of government.

There is also a need to discuss the sometimes  controversial  issue  of  the
powers and functions of all spheres  of  government.  There  may  indeed  be
powers and functions  that  currently  reside  at  national  and  provincial
government levels, which may be better performed by local  government.  This
is in addition to powers and functions that may currently  reside  with  the
national Government but require to be devolved  to  provincial  governments.
This, in my view, will in turn  reduce  the  number  of  conditional  grants
usually made available to provinces and municipalities.

The argument is sometimes raised that  we  should  scrap  provinces  because
most of them are not able to rise to the challenge of service  delivery.  We
disagree with this position. We need to recognise first  and  foremost  that
South  Africa  has  emerged  from  the  transition  with  one  of  the  best
constitutions and a system  of  government  unprecedented  anywhere  in  the
world, albeit a hybrid of many systems of Western democracies. We must  work
hard to ensure that it works. We must  not  allow  the  little  haggles  and
teething problems to detract us from this resolve.

The problems of capacity to deliver  services  effectively  and  efficiently
are problems we must acknowledge, and we do acknowledge them as the  Gauteng
province. What most provinces are  experiencing  are  indeed  problems  also
faced by a number of national departments. It  would  be  wrong  to  suggest
that  national  departments  struggling  to  find  their  footing  must   be
dissolved, and if it is wrong to say so, it is  also  wrong  to  say  so  in
respect of provinces.

I think what is required is for the system of South Africa's  governance  to
be consolidated. We must be proud of the nature of our democracy,  including
how it was attained and how it is evolving  day  by  day.  A  South  African
brand of democracy is being born here and many nations are watching  to  see
how it prospers so that they, too, can learn from it.

The South African Constitution is stronger in  many  areas.  An  attempt  to
dislodge  one  of  its  fundamental  aspects,  namely   the   structure   of
government, will not only send the wrong signals to  our  citizens  and  the
world, but does indeed shake our commitment to seeing our democracy mature.

Provinces serve not just the practical functions  of  service  delivery,  as
has been the focus of some critics, but  also  serve  political  imperatives
such as the political representation  of  a  spectrum  of  people.  What  is
required is to confront the real issues of the weaknesses of  provinces  and
to continue to seek ways of addressing them.

National Government has an obligation to play  a  role  in  this  work  too.
Local government, on the other hand, plays an important role in  our  system
of governance, conceived largely as  a  delivery  and  developmental  organ.
Section 153 of the  Constitution  requires  that  local  government,  and  I
quote:


  ... structure and manage its administration and budgeting,  and  planning
  processes to give priority to the basic needs of the  community,  and  to
  promote the social and economic development of the community ...

Seen as a developmental and delivery sphere of government, local  government
is accorded by the Constitution what can be referred  to  as  administrative
functions, as  opposed  to  policy  and  legislative  functions,  which  are
explicitly accorded  to  national  and  provincial  spheres  of  government.
Although municipalities have powers to make  by-laws,  this  is  limited  to
making their administrative functions possible to carry  out,  thus  limited
to their delivery and developmental  functions,  evident  in  the  kinds  of
issues both Parts B of Schedules 4 and 5 stipulate.

Together with municipalities in Gauteng, we are aware of the fact  that  our
people cannot be spectators in  policy  formulation  and  service  delivery.
That is why we continue to give expression  to  our  commitment  to  people-
centred governance through a sustained programme of direct  interaction  and
engagement with the people of our province, where they live.

This year alone, we have visited Randfontein, Zenzele and Bekkersdal on  the
West   Rand;   Vanderbijlpark,   Everton   and    Rotunda    in    Sedibeng;
Bronkhorstspruit,  Zithobe  and  Rethabiseng  in  the  Metsweding  district;
Daveyton  in  Ekurhuleni;  Atteridgeville  in  Tswane;  and  Ivory  Park  in
Johannesburg. This programme is a living  expression  of  direct  government
accountability to the people. It gives effect  to  peoples'  right  to  know
what Government is doing and plans to do. It enables citizens to make  their
voices heard and impact directly on service delivery in their areas.

I would like to respond to a few points of what the Deputy  President  said.
Firstly, I am happy to announce that Gauteng's audited  financial  statement
for the 2000-01 financial year has been done and it  will  be  debated  from
the middle of October in the legislature. This is going to be  done  at  the
same time as we debate the annual reports, which means we are not  going  to
debate the annual reports and only next year look at the resources.  We  are
going to be looking at the annual reports, looking  at  the  resources  that
have been spent, and then we are able to justify why we  were  not  able  to
implement programmes that we have said we would  be  able  to  implement.  I
think this will make the Deputy President's  job  easier  in  terms  of  the
review.

Secondly, we have requested all MECs to brief all committees  on  priorities
for the next three years, to get input prior to  finalisation  in  November.
We have also taken a view, based on the report we received yesterday  during
the extended Cabinet meeting, that we will  participate  in  the  integrated
fiscal review debate. We think in that way we will also be able to  indicate
what it is that we are doing, what the challenges and problems are and  what
we can do.
In conclusion, there are a number of  areas  around  which  we  are  working
together with local government. If one takes Pretoria, there  is  work  that
we are doing with them in terms of the IT hub and the auto cluster.  If  one
takes Ekurhuleni - his Excellency Mayor Bavumile is here -  we  are  working
with them as well in terms of revamping the manufacturing areas  of  Alrode,
Germiston and Wadeville. We are also working on a similar approach with  the
mayors of Sedibeng in the Vaal, as well as those of the West Rand.

A similar approach is taking place with Johannesburg and  the  Minister  for
Justice and Constitutional Development. We are working on  a  constitutional
Bill in which we seek to preserve the women's section of the  Old  Fort  and
turn that into a proper museum, hopefully to house  the  Gender  Commission.
The Old Fort is the only prison in the world in which  two  legends  of  our
time, Mandela and Gandhi, both spent time. We think it is important that  we
preserve that. There are therefore a number of areas  around  which  we  are
working and we believe we can succeed.
The co-operative nature of the South African system of  governance  requires
that each sphere of government does not  act  in  isolation,  and  that  the
country's resources are used in a way that balances the different  interests
of each sphere of government, as well as geographical areas, by  emphasising
issues of shared interest to ensure maximum efficiency. [Applause.]

Mr C B HERANDIEN (Western Cape): Madam Chair, hon Deputy President,  members
of the NCOP, it is indeed a privilege for me to address  the  Council  today
on behalf of our premier, Mr Gerald Morkel. Please allow me  at  the  outset
to  tender  an  apology  on  behalf  of  my  premier.  Due   to   unforeseen
circumstances, he will not be able to be with us here today.

Vergun my om ten aanvang dan ook 'n lansie te breek vir mnr  Morkel.  Ek  is
seker dat alle politici  wat  vertroud  is  met  die  gebeurlikhede  in  die
provinsiale regeringsfeer  sal  saamstem  dat  mnr  Morkel,  sedert  hy  die
premierskap oorgeneem het, homself as 'n leier van  formaat  onderskei  het.
Hy het veral daarin geslaag om klein  politieke  asook  kleinlike  politieke
slaggate te vermy, en toe te sien dat die  politieke  besluitneming  in  die
Wes-Kaap in belang van al die inwoners van die Wes-Kaap  is.  Ons,  as  Wes-
Kaap loof hom daarvoor. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Allow me at the outset also to put in a good word for Mr Morkel. I am  sure
that all politicians familiar  with  events  in  the  provincial  sphere  of
government will agree that since Mr Morkel took over the premiership he  has
distinguished himself as a formidable leader.  He  especially  succeeded  in
avoiding petty and small-minded political pitfalls,  and  in  ensuring  that
the political decision-making in the Western Cape is in the interest of  all
the inhabitants of the Western Cape. We, the Western Cape, applaud  him  for
this.]

Before I comment on the performance of the Western Cape government, I  would
like to share with the House  the  principles  on  which  the  Western  Cape
policy framework is based. The overall objective of the Western Cape  fiscal
policy framework is to direct departmental budget allocations  and  planning
towards attaining the provincial strategic outcomes. These desired  outcomes
were formulated by the Western Cape during 1999, with  a  10th  being  added
towards the end of 2000. These outcomes serve  as  the  ultimate  goals  for
which all departments should strive.

They entail the  following:  to  contribute  to  the  creation  of  a  safer
environment for the people; to create an enabling environment  for  economic
growth; to prepare the people of the Western Cape for the knowledge  economy
of the 21st century; to contain the spread of HIV/Aids and tuberculosis;  to
empower the poor people of the  province  through  the  provision  of  basic
services; to improve the quality and the accessibility of  services  offered
by the provincial government; to protect,  enhance  and  promote  the  total
environment for the optimal development  of  the  people;  to  maintain  and
improve the physical infrastructure required  for  the  development  of  the
province; to bind the province as the gateway to  Africa;  and,  lastly,  to
improve on rural development.
The Western Cape government has, since the last general election,  succeeded
in maintaining a proud record of clean government. The watchdog bodies  such
as the Public  Protector's  office  have  investigated  no  major  cases  of
corruption in this province. This is the result of a quite unique  style  of
financial discipline and precision management that earmarks  the  managerial
style of  the  provincial  officials  of  the  Western  Cape.  A  specialist
forensic  audit  component  with  legal  capabilities,  consisting   of   14
investigators, has contributed greatly to the prevention of irregularities.

A very important flagship project in the field of human resources  was  also
completed during the previous financial year. The primary objective  of  the
project,  aptly  named  Transformation   2000,   was   to   inject   greater
representivity into the top  provincial  management  echelons.  The  Western
Cape realised that the demographics reflected in  the  1996  census  figures
were not mirrored in the senior management profile of this province.

I must  immediately  point  out  that  our  objective  was  not  to  enforce
transformation at all cost. There are already several reported case  studies
that  proved  that  such  an  approach  can  lead  to  detrimental  results.
Therefore, our aim was rather to promote the principles  of  Batho  Pele  by
creating a management team that represented a balanced  range  of  community
interests.

I am proud  to  announce  today  that  our  approach  did  render  excellent
results. More than 3 000 applications were received  for  the  60  positions
that became available. We were not only able to bring our senior  management
profile in line with the demographic profile of the province,  but  we  were
also fortunate enough to secure the services of some of the  best  qualified
and most capable candidates from the previously disadvantaged communities.

I supervised the whole process and participated in most  of  the  interviews
as a panel member. I can assure the House that it is a total myth  that  the
top talent amongst the previously disadvantaged communities  does  not  want
to work in the Western Cape. The  applications  and  appointments  resulting
out of  the  Transformation  2000  process  proved  that  the  Western  Cape
government and provincial administration  are  much  sought-after  employers
amongst all population groups. [Interjections.]

The Western Cape has in the past been accused of seeing itself as  a  little
political island. [Interjections.] I can assure members of this  House  that
nothing  is  further  from  the  truth.  Since  the  adoption  of  the   new
constitution the Western Cape has gone out of its way to position itself  as
a fully fledged supportive partner  in  the  provincial  sphere.  Since  the
recognition of three independent spheres of government forms  the  basis  of
our Constitution, it is of paramount  importance  that  all  nine  provinces
wholeheartedly participate in the intergovernmental structures that  act  as
the roots of the system.

I want to assure members  today  that  the  Western  Cape  has  taken  these
structures very seriously. Our  politicians  and  officials  are  diligently
attending  the  meetings  of   the   various   intergovernmental   relations
structures  and  our  commitment  and  contributions  are  well  documented.
[Interjections.]

I am not going to embark upon a long list of comparisons in order  to  prove
that the Western Cape is the leading province in that sphere of  government.
[Interjections.] On the other hand, I would be forsaking my duty  if  I  did
not  share  a   few   relevant   socioeconomic   facts   with   the   House.
[Interjections.] Not all the premiers are here today. [Interjections.]

With regard to health services, it is an accepted fact that life  expectancy
is a reliable measure of  access  to  health  services,  as  well  as  other
socioeconomic variables such as housing conditions  and  social  order.  The
average life expectancy in the Western Cape is 68, whereas in  the  rest  of
the country, according to  Statistics  SA,  it  is  only  63,2.  The  infant
mortality rate of 26 deaths per 1 000 live births is  also  way  beyond  the
national average of 41 deaths per 1 000.

In the field of education, the Western Cape  government  has  been  actively
promoting the establishment of a knowledge economy as one of  the  cabinet's
primary objectives. The adult literacy rate of 95% places the  Western  Cape
more than 10 percentage points higher than the  national  average.  Historic
data corroborated by Statistics SA confirm that 95% of all children  between
the ages of 6 and 17 are enrolled in educational institutions.

The Western Cape government and administration put in a concerted effort  to
enhance their capacity in the field of information technology. The  computer
network was increased from 5 800  to  7  100  end  users.  The  network  now
provides services to 84 sites  throughout  the  province.  This  includes  a
comprehensive electronic mail service and a hi-tech data warehouse.

Gender issues also  received  ample  attention  with  the  establishment  of
departmental gender structures. The formulation  of  guidelines  and  policy
and  the  development  and  implementation  of  training   and   educational
programmes paved  the  way  for  the  promotion  of  gender  issues  in  the
provincial arena.

Urbanisation and migration have also left their mark on the economy  of  the
Western Cape. The province has  experienced  a  high  degree  of  functional
urbanisation,  mainly  as  a  result  of  the  hardships  suffered  by   the
agricultural sector. Unfavourable  weather  patterns  earmarked  by  lengthy
droughts have caused job  losses  in  the  rural  areas.  The  migration  of
farmworkers to the metropolitan areas has  further  been  augmented  by  the
influx of migrants from other provinces. The labour market  could  not  cope
with this rapid expansion of  the  urban  labour  forces,  resulting  in  an
increase in small-time crime and squatting.

Looking at the very important field of housing, 1994 saw  the  launch  of  a
new housing subsidy scheme. This scheme was aimed  at  providing  1  million
houses within five years. The Western Cape was allocated  114 000  units  as
its portion of the national target. Although the national  target  was  only
met recently, the Western Cape managed to  complete  its  quota  within  the
five-year timeframe.

It has continued this excellent performance by providing shelter to as  many
families as its budget allows. I am proud to announce that, by  the  end  of
the 2000-01 financial year, we had created no less than 148 000 new  housing
opportunities in the Western Cape. We have  also  spent  every  single  cent
allocated to us by the national Department of Housing.

This is a major achievement compared to some of  the  other  provinces  that
regularly end up with large amounts of unspent  housing  money.  I  want  to
place on record that the Western Cape provincial department of  housing  has
to date allocated more than R1,8 billion  to  housing  projects  within  the
provincial boundaries.

It is, however, necessary to  place  these  figures  into  perspective.  The
housing backlog in the  Western  Cape  is  currently  estimated  at  310 000
units. It is projected that this number will grow to  a  staggering  410 000
units by the year 2006. If the government can secure the building of  42 000
units per annum, a potential beneficiary will be on  the  waiting  list  for
ten years and the backlog will be eliminated in 24 years from now.

The delivery of 40 000 units per year will see a beneficiary on the  waiting
list for eight years  and  the  backlog  wiped  out  within  15  years.  The
problem, however, is that a budget allocation  of  R736  million  per  annum
will be needed to fund the building of 40 000 units per year.

The cold reality is that the Western Cape only  received  R322  million  for
the current financial year and can look forward to  an  allocation  of  R343
million for the next financial year. In practical terms, this means that  we
will be playing  catch-up  forever,  trying  to  eliminate  an  unmanageable
backlog.

To add insult to injury, the subsidy amount  is  shrinking  in  real  terms.
This  makes  it  increasingly  difficult  to  provide  the  acceptable   and
sustainable family units that are needed for the  creation  of  more  stable
families and communities.

Daar  is  politici  wat  openlik  verkondig  dat  hulle  vertroue   in   die
provinsiale regeringsfeer verloor het. Daar is diegene  wat  van  mening  is
dat die skrywers van die Grondwet gefouteer het deur vir drie  regeringsfere
voorsiening te maak.

Ek verskil van hulle. Agb lede moet onthou dat  ons  Grondwet  nog  'n  baie
jong een is. Grondwette neem dekades, dikwels eeue om gevestig  te  raak  en
ek meen dit is voortydig om nou reeds 'n oordeel oor ons  nuwe  Grondwet  te
vel.

Ek glo die provinsiale regeringsfeer  vervul  'n  belangrike  rigtinggewende
rol in  die  grondwetlike  omgewing.  Dit  was  veral  duidelik  tydens  die
onlangse drastiese herstruktureringsproses wat die plaaslike  owerheidsektor
ondergaan het. Dit is juis in tye soos dié wat die provinsiale  regering  sy
staal  toon  om  die  belangebalans  tussen  'n  makro-ingestelde  nasionale
regering en 'n gefokusde plaaslike owerheidsektor te handhaaf.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[There are politicians who state openly that they have  lost  faith  in  the
provincial sphere of government. There are those  who  are  of  the  opinion
that the drafters of the Constitution erred in providing for  three  spheres
of government.

I do not agree with them. Hon members must remember  that  our  Constitution
is still very young. It takes decades, often  centuries,  for  constitutions
to become established, and I think it is premature to pass judgment  on  our
new Constitution at this stage.

I believe the provincial sphere of  government  fulfills  an  important  key
role in the constitutional environment. This  was  especially  clear  during
the recent drastic restructuring process that the  local  government  sector
has undergone. It is precisely in  times  like  these  that  the  provincial
government shows  its  strength  in  maintaining  the  balance  of  interest
between a macro-attuned national government and a focused  local  government
sector.]

The emergence of provincial leadership of this sort is a natural  result  of
a  balanced  three-tiered  government  system.  The  challenges  that  await
resolution, namely the redistribution of wealth, opportunity and  resources,
can best be dealt with at provincial level. [Applause.]

Mr P A  MATTHEE:  Chairperson,  in  his  keynote  address  at  the  national
conference on the imperative of  co-operative  governance  on  8  May  1998,
Deputy President Mbeki, as he then was, inter alia said that the real  value
the NCOP could add to the costly exercise of governance was evident  in  the
manner  in  which  the  NCOP  dealt  with  the  Eastern  Cape   intervention
concerning the affairs of the Butterworth municipality.  This  also  brought
to the fore the important oversight role the NCOP had to play in future.

The  two  constitutional  amending  Bills  of  this  year  potentially  have
profound implications for the NCOP's supervisory role over interventions  in
provincial and local government. I want to thank Prof Nico Steytler  of  the
University of the  Western  Cape  for  his  excellent  exposition  of  these
implications.

Sections 100 and  139  of  our  Constitution  contain  specific  checks  and
balances for when a provincial  government  intervenes  in  a  municipality.
This House, as indicated by the  President,  plays  an  extremely  important
reviewing  role  where  a  provincial  government  assumes   the   executive
obligation of a municipality.

The proposed new section 155(8) provides  that  either  the  national  or  a
provincial government may exercise executive and  legislative  authority  on
behalf of a municipality either when the municipal council  cannot  function
or when there is a serious and persistent financial emergency.

This proposed new section is not directly linked  to  the  present  sections
100 or 139.  If  these  sections  are  not  applicable,  then  none  of  the
safeguards apply, even though the scope of  the  intervention  can  be  very
intrusive, including the assumption of legislative authority.

Not bound  by  any  constitutionally  prescribed  safeguards,  the  national
legislation enabling an intervention as envisaged by  the  proposed  section
need not include the supervisory role of the NCOP. By allowing  for  a  less
cumbersome procedure, the proposed section may render the  supervisory  role
of the NCOP in this regard a dead letter.

The proposed creation of new  grounds  and  procedures  for  very  intrusive
interventions, if allowed at all, should make the supervisory  role  of  the
NCOP more important, not less.

In terms of the present sections 100  and  139,  this  Council  is  given  a
special task to ensure that each and every intervention is not only  lawful,
but also compatible with the spirit of co-operative governance.

This House ensures that the proper balance  between  the  three  spheres  of
government is maintained, but the  proposed  amendments  turn  this  process
around and shift the  onus  from  the  intervening  national  or  provincial
government  that  must  convince  the  Council,   this   House,   that   the
intervention is justified, to the province or  municipality  subject  to  an
intervention.

The reason for these proposed changes is unclear at this stage. The  absence
of a mandatory review of interventions will be compounded by the absence  of
a strict timeframe within which it must be done.

A sense of urgency is needed  because  an  intervention  by  one  sphere  in
another conflicts directly with co-operative governance, which is  based  on
the principle that no sphere encroaches on the geographical,  functional  or
institutional integrity of government in another sphere.

One cannot help being astounded at  these  proposed  measures,  which  would
very seriously undermine the  supervisory  role  of  this  Council  and  its
capacity to also look after the  interests  of  both  provincial  and  local
government.

The delicately balanced structures agreed to  by  all  the  parties  at  the
constitutional negotiations would be undermined by these  amendments,  which
would weaken the control over local government by provincial government  and
would seriously water down the supervisory role of the Council.

It  seems  that  there  are  widespread   objections   to   these   proposed
constitutional amendments. I noted the  serious  objections  of  Salga,  the
governments of the Western Cape and North West provinces, Dr  Sutcliffe  and
even Cosatu. It is of great concern that the ANC government agreed  to  such
far-reaching constitutional amendments with, it  seems,  little  attempt  to
achieve a wide consensus, even within its own ranks.

I think I speak for most members of  all  parties  in  this  House,  in  the
provincial  legislatures  and  councils  ...  [Interjections.]  ...  when  I
seriously ask the Deputy President, as  Leader  of  Government  Business  in
this  Parliament,  to  request  Cabinet   to   reconsider   these   proposed
constitutional amendments.

I would like to tell the Deputy President that  I  have  little  doubt  that
most members would openly agree with my argument were it not  for  the  fact
that the undemocratic antidefection clause is unfortunately  still  part  of
our law.

I am sure that other members would appreciate it  if  the  Deputy  President
could indicate to us what the  Government's  thinking  is  in  this  regard,
because this Parliament and, indeed, our democracy, cannot  afford  to  lose
another Andrew Feinstein. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon  member,  I
allowed you  to  proceed  and  debate  a  Bill  which  is  not  even  before
Parliament, and is also not the subject matter of our debate  today.  It  is
not a matter before the House.

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, hon Deputy President,  premiers,  members  and
mayors present here today, allow me this opportunity to first of all make  a
very important announcement.

I want to congratulate my premier on his first-born  girl.  He  is  a  daddy
now. I wish him well with baby-sitting, and I will teach him how  to  change
nappies. [Laughter.]

This debate is a crucial one for us. Over  the  years  we  decided  that  we
wanted to build a particular kind of democracy in our country. This  is  now
happening and the vital role of the NCOP is part of that process.  Therefore
this debate will inform us much more about the key issues  around  the  role
of the NCOP.

When South Africans adopted the  interim  Constitution  prior  to  the  1994
elections, little was known about the difficulties  that  lay  ahead.  Quite
clearly, the Senate was becoming another House  of  Parliament,  replicating
the National Assembly's activities and debates,  rather  than  dealing  with
provincial matters.

It needed to be restructured to ensure  a  link  between  senators  and  the
provinces which they come from. Thus the NCOP  was  formed  to  ensure  that
those interests were taken into account.

Our mandate is to ensure that provincial interests are  taken  into  account
in the national sphere of government. This is done  primarily  by  providing
for  provincial  participation  in  the  national  legislative  process  and
through public participation in the national forum on issues  affecting  the
provinces.  In  this  way,  it  provides  for  a  dynamic  and  much  closer
relationship between the province and its NCOP representatives.

In a nutshell, our  role  is  shaped  by  our  constitutional  mandate,  the
provincial interests arising from  national  policy  action  and  provincial
experience, and the functioning and planning of our committees.

Most importantly, it strengthens  the  representation  of  poorer  and  less
populous regions so as  to  promote  development  and  growth  in  the  less
developed  provinces  without   inhibiting   development   in   those   with
historically greater resources at their disposal.

This mandate goes beyond being a national forum. It provides that we  should
facilitate public participation. It links the NCOP to the  local  government
sphere  and  provides  important  oversight  powers  with  respect  to   the
provincial and national officials. In that  way  it  is  the  heart  of  co-
operative governance.

Despite the challenges we have been facing as the NCOP, we have  managed  to
prioritise our work in a very meaningful way. We  hold  the  view  that  our
committees are the most challenged of all in the South  African  legislative
environment. They are  few,  with  hard-pressed  members  who  face  a  wide
agenda. Despite being a team of 54 permanent members, we are expected to  do
work that is shared among 400 members in the NA. Time  management  has  been
our watchword.

In this short period of time,  we  are  proud  to  say  that  amongst  other
accomplishments, we have improved our liaison  with  the  provinces  through
NCOP Online, which has become a source of  information  for  the  provinces.
Through what I can call our crossing of the technology  Rubicon,  provincial
issues have become easier and better, and  legislative  processes  are  more
organised.

The  strategies  currently  employed  by  our  permanent  delegates  include
working closely with our NA counterparts during the consideration  of  Bills
and ensuring that proposed amendments are taken on board in the  NA.  It  is
also important to know that quite a number of Bills scrutinised by the  NCOP
are amended and then adopted by the NA.

The  NCOP  plays  a  vital  role  in  intergovernmental  relations  and  the
promotion of horizontal relations between local  governments.  Some  of  our
achievements   include   the   implementation   of   municipal   legislation
initiatives aimed at building the capacity of municipalities, the review  of
delegated legislation; the review  of  national  and  provincial  government
interventions and resolving disputes about the  administrative  capacity  of
provincial governments.

The constitutional basis of the power  of  the  province  to  monitor  local
government is set out in  section  155(6)  of  our  Constitution,  where  it
provides that each provincial government must  establish  municipalities  in
its province, in a manner consistent with legislation enacted  in  terms  of
subsections (2) and (3) and by legislative or other measures.

I have noticed that all the speakers before me touched on local  government.
One is quite impressed to see that we have such a large delegation of  Salga
members here today. I think that  they  can  play  a  more  active  role  in
interacting with us in the legislative process. We regard  local  government
as a very important sphere of government,  because  that  is  the  level  of
government that is closest to our people.

Section 139 of the  Constitution  authorises  the  provincial  executive  to
intervene in a municipality when it does not fulfil an executive  obligation
in terms of legislation. This section covers more  than  just  a  provincial
executive taking remedial action. It  also  includes  a  process  whereby  a
province reviews and monitors the  actions  of  the  municipalities  falling
within its jurisdiction.

This section has, however, two components, the first being  the  process  of
provincial review of the actions of local government  in  order  to  measure
the fulfilment by local government of its executive obligations. The  second
is a process of correction,  should  local  government  fall  short  of  its
obligations.

With regard to  interventions,  we  have  taken  the  view  that  they  were
regressive and they had to be prevented by  setting  out  an  early  warning
system, as well as healthier monitoring on the part of the  provinces.  This
would mean a more  consistent  interaction  and  sharing  of  ideas  between
provincial government and the NCOP  about  those  municipalities  which  are
affected and experience difficulties.

Provinces like the North West and the Northern Cape, which had a  number  of
municipalities that were bailed out by means  of  provincial  interventions,
already had such systems in place before the end of last  year.  Right  from
the very first intervention in Butterworth,  the  NCOP  adopted  a  problem-
solving approach to its role in interventions. It examined  each  and  every
case on the ground, not just on the  merits  or  the  papers  submitted.  It
interviewed the communities, provinces, and councillors  concerned,  engaged
with them and mediated any conflicts that may have existed between parties.

One of the most critical areas, the role of Salga within the NCOP, which  is
a  direct  link  between  the  local  government  and  national  Government,
highlights the special role of co-operative governance played by the NCOP.
The NCOP's role is unique in as far as it is compared to the  NA's  position
regarding  the  provincial  legislature's  role.  Neither   the   provincial
legislature nor the NA is in a position to identify and  act  upon  problems
with those national policies that are implemented by provincial executives.

The NCOP, therefore, provides a forum for  the  articulation  of  local  and
provincial government concerns at national level. It plays  a  central  role
between the spheres of government. It is in that link between  the  national
Parliament and  the  provincial  legislatures  that  the  NCOP  is  uniquely
situated.

The  South  African  Constitution  obliges  Government  to  involve   public
participation. It therefore stands to reason that the NCOP would not  regard
public  participation  as  just  an  ordinary  exercise,   but   rather   as
obligatory.  This  entails  that,  in  collaboration  with  the   provincial
legislatures, the NCOP has a duty to ensure  that  decisions  taken  on  the
national level have involved the public.
In conjunction with the above, one of our areas  of  success  has  been  the
achievements  of  the  review  debates.  These  debates  are  organised   by
provinces together with the NCOP, to deal with certain issues of policy.

These debates  provide  an  opportunity  for  provinces  to  look  at  their
objectives, what they have achieved, and whether their  programmes  were  in
tandem with those of other provinces or the national Government.

They bring to life issues that affect provinces. In that way,  they  reflect
different voices  from  different  provinces.  The  aim  of  fostering  this
constitutional obligation of public participation  is  to  encourage  public
participation at the provincial legislature level, which  must  be  informed
by the desire to target certain  priority  issues  in  which  the  NCOP  can
exercise  more  influence  in  terms  of  decision-making.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr D E AFRICA (North West): Chairperson of the NCOP,  Mr  Deputy  President,
premiers, representatives of Salga, and special and permanent  delegates,  I
stand here today to represent the Premier of the  North  West  province,  Mr
Popo Molefe, who is recuperating after major surgery. He, however, sent  his
warm greetings and support from the North West  provincial  government.  May
I, in the same breath, thank the NCOP for arranging this  important  session
and  the  Deputy  President  for  his  illuminating  speech  on  this  ever-
challenging notion of co-operative and cogovernance, which  must,  following
the new system of local government, be ever present on the agenda.

This debate could not have come at a better  time.  The  future  powers  and
roles of provinces and local government have, of late,  become  subjects  of
intense media speculation. It has been widely suggested that, with  the  new
local government dispensation which provides more power  to  municipalities,
the role of provincial government is becoming minimal.

We are further told that the inclination on the part of  central  Government
is to deal directly with  municipalities.  This  development,  it  has  been
emphasised, will result in municipalities becoming more and  more  powerful,
with a  smaller  role  for  provincial  government  in  relation  to  issues
relating to local government.

The Deputy President's speech  to  this  august  House  this  afternoon  has
confounded supporters of the  above  theory.  It  has  confirmed  our  long-
standing belief and practice that the relationship between  all  spheres  of
government is grounded on the  firm  principle  of  sound  intergovernmental
relations and co-operative governance. The three spheres of  government  are
integral parts of our body politic.

They are part of a bigger whole, hence, they  are  distinctively  autonomous
but interrelated. One cannot function efficiently  and  effectively  without
the support and participation of the others. This House further confirms  in
this sitting the need to give effect to the provisions of Chapter  3  fully.
We are satisfied that today's debate has reconfirmed the  sanctity  of  this
principle, as clearly stipulated in Chapter 3 of  the  Constitution  of  the
Republic of South Africa.

We are certain that a more programmatic  framework  shall  be  developed  to
practicalise Chapter 3 of the  Constitution,  with  the  specific  focus  on
ensuring that both the provincial and national spheres play a critical  role
in strengthening local government.

The North West provincial government has and will continue  to  nurture  the
relationship with other spheres of government. We are an  active  member  of
the President's Co-ordinating Council. Through  this  forum,  the  President
has created a platform on which provinces are  afforded  an  opportunity  to
discuss directly with the President issues of common interest.  We  wish  to
reiterate the views expressed by the Premier of Gauteng that in  this  Forum
we should begin to give  more  attention  to  the  issue  of  cross-boundary
municipalities to ensure that this system, as  envisaged,  works  cohesively
countrywide.

Indeed, the PCC has the potential to be at  the  apex  of  intergovernmental
relations and can continually refine our approach to give  real  meaning  to
the principle of cogovernance,  with  the  NCOP  playing  a  major  role  in
ensuring that no sphere of government deviates from this approach.

We have also established similar structures at provincial  level.  We  have,
accordingly, established the provincial intergovernmental forum that  brings
together the premier, supported by all members  of  the  executive  council,
representatives of organised local government, and the house of  traditional
leaders. This forum is guided by the need for effective co-operation and co-
ordination between provincial and local government,  whilst  respecting  the
autonomy of the various spheres. It is sufficiently flexible to  respond  to
potential synergies, whilst retaining  the  strategic  vision  which  guides
this forum.

The PIGF has as one of  its  important  members  the  house  of  traditional
leaders. We are pleased to inform this  House  that  the  relationship  with
traditional leaders in our province has  been  a  cordial  and  constructive
one. We can confidently report that the  Bafokeng  royal  administration  is
now participating in the  new  system  of  local  government,  after  having
agreed on an agency agreement with the municipality  of  Rustenburg.  It  is
envisaged that the provincial government, through the PIGF,  will  foster  a
partnership with traditional leaders in order to  implement  the  Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development  Strategy  that  was  announced  earlier  this
year.

Since its formation in 1997,  the  provincial  intergovernmental  forum  has
occupied  centre  stage  in  provincial  government  relations  with   local
government. It is heartening to report that through the PIGF  we  were  able
to successfully drive the process of ensuring that local  government  played
a critical role in provincial planning processes.

It is also through this forum that a successful conference was held to  look
at how we can begin to deal with the issue of the provision  of  free  basic
services to our communities. Indeed, the PIGF has proved to be an  important
consultative forum, where all relevant stakeholders rally  around  a  common
developmental vision.

The  newly  established  local  government  structures  have  presented  new
challenges to  the  intergovernmental  systems  and  structures.  The  Local
Government: Municipal Systems  Act  imposes  a  duty  on  municipalities  to
facilitate compliance with the  principle  of  co-operative  governance  and
intergovernmental relations. To this  end,  the  provincial  government  has
established the Premier's Mayoral Forum through which the premier  seeks  to
forge consensus with mayors on key developmental challenges.

The  new  approach  of  the  integrated  development  planning  process  has
revolutionalised  the  way  local  governments,  and,   indeed,   provincial
governments, conduct their business. We  view  the  role  of  the  premier's
forum as being one of co-ordinating and facilitating a common  framework  on
integrated development and planning.

We have to ensure that all plans of provincial  and  local  governments  are
synergised, and have created a provincial IDP  review  committee  where  all
spheres of government and departments come together to ensure that  all  our
plans are integrated and reflected in the IDPs.

However, there are some hurdles that we need to overcome if we are  to  live
true to the principle of sound and co-operative governance. It seems  to  us
that the major battle is ignorance about the discipline itself. It seems  we
need to do more to expand our knowledge  and  understanding,  and  also  the
understanding  of  the  broader  community  on  this  wonderful  system   of
intergovernmental  relations,  for  we  cannot  prescribe  proper   remedies
without  a  good  diagnosis  of  the  system.  We  therefore  need  rigorous
education and an information-sharing  programme  in  order  to  promote  the
principle and practice  of  intergovernmental  relations,  for,  as  we  are
sitting here today, we are intergovernmental practitioners, indeed.

It is the wish of the North West provincial government that the  process  of
fostering strong partnerships between all spheres of  government  continues.
This  will  ensure  that  every  sphere,  while  autonomous,  interacts  and
consults with one another in the spirit of co-operative governance  and  the
achievement of common goals in all matters of mutual interest.

The real test  of  our  approach  to  intergovernmental  relations  and  co-
operative governance is how  we  empower  local  government  to  propel  our
people into an environment in which they will  be  the  real  architects  of
microtransformation; integrated development and  change.  They  should  also
play a critical role in changing the microcharacter  of  our  cities,  towns
and villages.

We will all benefit greatly if this House can, within the first year of  the
existence of the new system of local government, develop a  framework  which
will  comprehensively  engage  all  three  spheres  to  take   forward   and
practicalise the notion  of  co-operative  governance  and  cogovernance  in
order to ensure  that  we  deliver  and  provide  services  in  a  cohesive,
integrated, systematic and programmatic approach. [Applause.]

Mr  L  RAMATLAKANE  (Western  Cape):  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy   President,
premiers and members, I would like to thank the  hon  the  Deputy  President
and the NCOP for this important debate on the subject that  is  particularly
and uniquely relevant to the Western Cape.

In order to understand intergovernmental  relations  we,  firstly,  need  to
understand  the  role  of  the  three  spheres   of   government   and   the
constitutional imperative of Chapter 3 on co-operative  governance.  In  the
Western Cape, we see this understanding seriously  affected  by  the  ruling
political  party  objective  on  the  part  of  the  DA  -  this  prejudiced
constructive intergovernmental relations. I was provoked to speak the  truth
and I think that they must listen to it. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon member,  can
you please take your seat. I would like to ask hon members not  to  howl  at
each other. I will immediately name somebody because you are,  now,  getting
out of order.

Mr L  RAMATLAKANE  (Western  Cape):  Chairperson,  only  yesterday,  in  the
provincial legislature, we witnessed an  example  of  how  intergovernmental
relations should not be conducted. The MEC for agriculture  in  the  Western
Cape, with the full backing of the provincial cabinet, tabled a  Bill  which
seeks  to  privatise  the  provincial  department   of   agriculture,   thus
converting  it  into  a  statutory  body.  Our  concern  is  that  this  new
privatised board  would  put  agricultural  services  beyond  the  reach  of
emerging African and coloured farmers.

A further concern is that the department itself is totally  unrepresentative
of the people in this province, contrary  to  Transformation  2000,  as  was
mentioned earlier on. The transformation  of  this  sector  will  be  almost
impossible if this Bill becomes law.

The Western Cape MEC has never  formally  raised  this  Bill  at  the  Minec
level. To make matters worse,  the  department  has  not  received  official
National Treasury approval for a Western Cape Bill.  The  national  Minister
has also cautioned the MEC that she would have to oppose  this  Bill  if  it
went forward.

It  is  this  tendency  called  ``go  it  alone''  which  goes  against  the
transformation agenda and which often characterises  the  DA  government  in
the Western Cape. The DA continues to exploit the votes of the coloured  and
poor to promote and retain white privilege. [Interjections.]

We remember very well how the DA-controlled  Western  Cape  government  took
the national Government to court in  an  attempt  to  keep  the  Khayelitsha
community out of the Tygerberg municipality. This  was  an  example  of  the
taxpayers' money being used to  gerrymander  boundaries  to  promote  racist
apartheid divisions. The Western Cape lost this  case  and  Khayelitsha  was
indeed included within the Tygerberg municipality. Not only did this  impact
negatively on intergovernmental relations, but it also cost the taxpayer  R5
million.

The recent flood disaster on the Cape Flats left poor African  and  coloured
families homeless and destitute. The  DA-controlled  spheres  of  government
consistently failed to act on this crisis. A full two  months  lapsed  while
provincial and local government failed to intervene. It was  only  when  the
national Government intervened and declared it a disaster area  that  things
were put in place. This is simply unacceptable. This neglects the  poor  and
not only exposes the DA's race priorities, but also highlights  the  failure
to  co-operate  constructively  with  the  other  ANC-controlled  levels  of
government.

Another example was the refusal by the provincial government to throw  their
weight  fully  behind  the  national   Government's   court   case   against
pharmaceutical companies. Instead, the MEC for  health,  the  hon  Koornhof,
accompanied the leader of the  DA,  Tony  Leon,  on  a  trip  to  Europe  to
negotiate separately with the very same  companies.  Clearly,  such  conduct
undermines intergovernmental relations or even  co-operative  governance  as
directed by Chapter 3 of the Constitution. It also sends mixed  messages  to
the international communities. The continuing attitude of the  DA  can  only
be summarised as a revolt against the Constitution.

Only yesterday the MPL Patrick McKenzie again  moved  a  motion  asking  the
premier to investigate the abuse of power by the MEC  for  local  government
in Theewaterskloof local government and other municipalities.  Here  the  DA
disregards the principles of intergovernmental  relations  and  co-operative
governance, and court action, without pursuance of  co-operative  governance
and the principle of intergovernmental relations, is the order of the day.

Currently, in the Western Cape provincial and local government  we  see  the
following  problems:  The  first  is  the  abuse  of  provincial  and  local
government budgets to  fight  interparty  political  battles,  such  as  the
street-naming fiasco. Over R1 million was spent to help the DP in its  fight
against the New NP to get rid of Peter Marais, while  other  allegations  of
corruption  by  DA  councillors  are  simply  ignored.  For   example,   the
allegation of corruption in housing that  have  been  reported  in  Westbank
have not been mentioned or dealt with yet.

The second problem is the abuse of the provincial government budget  in  the
form of a survey by the DA on its support, and running  a  public  relations
campaign to improve its image. The survey shows that  the  DA  is  perceived
as, and I quote, ``uncaring, out of touch, insensitive towards  the  African
and Coloured people.''

The province now wants  to  spend  R12  million  to  manipulate  the  public
perception by misleading the public into believing that  the  DA,  in  fact,
cares.

Thirdly, the NCOP also has certain powers to intervene in  local  government
on request by provinces. What concerns us is the selective manner  in  which
the MECs choose to  intervene.  Despite  being  requested  by  the  national
Minister to appoint a committee to investigate the  DA-controlled  Langeberg
municipality, the MEC concerned has refused to do so. Maybe the NCOP has  to
intervene and deal with this problem  without  undermining  the  independent
role of this sphere of government.

The NCOP must be aware of the international relations which provinces  build
independently. We are concerned that  our  provincial  government  has,  for
instance, entered into  a  relationship  with  what  we  call  a  right-wing
dominated local  government  in  Upper  Austria,  led  by  Jörg  Haider.  My
question is: How can such an agreement  be  reconciled  with  the  country's
overall foreign policy objectives? [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Order!  Order!
Hon members Ackermann, Dlulane and Majodina, you  are  causing  disorder  in
the House.

Dr Z  L  MKHIZE  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Mr  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  President,
premiers, hon members, I want to start  by  extending  an  apology  from  my
premier, Mr Mtshali, who  was  unable  to  attend  because  he  was  in  the
National Assembly yesterday and has to  be  in  the  provincial  legislature
today.

I also want to take the opportunity to thank the  Deputy  President  for  an
enlightening and analytical address. I want to say to this  House  that  our
province always considers the  NCOP  to  be  very  important.  But  we  also
believe that our province is one specimen of  how  South  African  democracy
works [Applause.] ... having moved from very  severe  violence  to  complete
peace. With the largest population in the country, it is  the  one  province
that has  got  seven  political  parties  and  a  coalition  government.  We
believe, therefore, that the voice of the provinces is important to hear.

We also believe that  the  NCOP  has  made  a  significant  contribution  by
creating an avenue for the provinces to express their  views  and  influence
national decisions. The fact that several provinces  had  to  be  to  placed
under section 100(1)(a) as a result of financial difficulties sounded  alarm
bells  for  all  of  us.  However,  the  support  and  co-operation  between
provinces and national Government, has ensured that, to  date,  no  province
has  had  to  be  placed  under  section  100  (1)(b),  where  the  national
Government has to take over its obligations.

There has also not yet been a need to invoke this section, as  a  result  of
either lack of ability or the lack of will to co-operate  by  any  province.
We believe that our constitutional democracy is  maturing  and  co-operative
governance is well understood and practised.

The existence of the  Presidential  Co-ordinating  Committee  has  played  a
pivotal role in addressing the problems experienced by  provinces.  Attempts
to solve  problems  in  close  co-operation  with  Treasury,  combined  with
stringent  financial  controls,  removed  KwaZulu-Natal  from  section   100
(1)(a), giving KwaZulu-Natal a positive and healthy financial status.

In addition to our fight against corruption, we are quite confident that  we
are able to direct our funds to our people.  The  cluster  system  that  has
also been adopted by the executive council has facilitated  interaction  and
promoted interdepartmental co-operation. We are now planning  a  forum  that
will include provincial  government,  local  government  and  the  House  of
Traditional Leaders in order to strengthen our co-operative governance.

I also think that it is notable that there has not been a  serious  conflict
either between the national Government and provinces or  between  provinces,
resulting in the need for a wide use of section 125 (4) which  provides  for
the NCOP to intervene in disputes. While the use of these provisions  is  an
acceptable and a normal sign of democracy at work, it  is  significant  that
the spirit of understanding between provinces and  our  national  Government
has not made the use of these provisions necessary.

Considering the  deep  conflict  from  which  South  African  democracy  has
emerged,  and  the  political  differences  and  diverse  interests  of  our
different communities, this is an outstanding  achievement.  It  is  also  a
compliment to the South African people and the leaders they elected.

The agenda of this House, the NCOP, and  the  spirit  of  debate  on  issues
involved will always remain a barometer of the political mood and  impending
or existing political turmoil and constitutional crisis in this country.

We also believe that  political  stability  in  our  province  and  the  co-
operation of the  parties  involved  in  the  coalition  government  in  our
province have contributed to the stability of South Africa as a country.

Allow me, therefore to raise a few topical issues  of  concern  that  affect
our  province,  which  the  support  of  national  Government  will   remain
paramount in ensuring that our province is able to cope  with.  Firstly,  we
want to welcome the prioritisation of four district councils,  Umkhanyakude,
uMzinyathi, Zululand and Ugu, for  the  implementation  of  the  Sustainable
Integrated Rural Development Programme. Few other  programmes  are  able  to
demonstrate an integrated approach and co-operative governance  amongst  the
three spheres of government as this particular programme is doing.

We also look forward to the extension of this  programme  to  the  remaining
district councils, because they are no richer.

We continue to appreciate the support the national  Government  is  offering
to our province in terms of projects that  are  geared  towards  stimulating
economic growth,  such  as  the  international  airport  and  other  related
projects.

The issue of the five basic services is also an issue  that  we  would  just
want to comment on. While these policies offer welcome relief  to  the  very
poor who are faced with the burden of making ends meet, it has  also  become
clear that the best-developed cities with  larger  financial  resources  are
best placed to take advantage of the policy. The smaller  municipalities  in
rural areas with  poor  infrastructure  face  a  steeper  challenge  in  the
implementation of this particular policy.
There was also an earlier confusion about the allocation of equitable  share
to the B municipalities, while the C municipalities bear the  responsibility
of the function. This also added to the challenge. We, however, welcome  the
news that additional resources have been  made  available  to  address  this
issue. We also welcome the work  that  is  being  done  to  concretise  this
policy in so far as the electricity supply is concerned.

The poor  supply  of  safe  and  clean  water  in  our  province  dramatised
complications during the outbreak of cholera, when more than 105 000  people
were affected and 228 deaths noted. However, we also note that  this  number
of deaths is less than  1%  of  deaths,  which  is  the  best  ever  figure,
resulting in the WHO sending  its  expects  to  record  this  experience  to
develop guidelines for other countries to follow.

But I think we must admit  that  the  cholera  problem  is  endemic  on  the
eastern side of our country. Therefore, it will continue to be with  us  and
will always show up where the water supply is not at its best. At a cost  of
more  than  R150  million,   this   is   also   the   best   reflection   of
interdepartmental co-operation and national support.

I want, therefore, to take this opportunity at this stage to pay tribute  to
the volunteers from all the provinces who  have  been  to  KwaZulu-Natal  to
assist us  in  fighting  this  problem.  Their  gesture  was  a  gesture  of
friendship.  It  was  a  mark  of  friendship,   solidarity   and,   indeed,
patriotism.

I therefore want members here to convey to  their  different  provinces  our
sincere gratitude for the  support  that  we  obtained  from  the  different
provinces.

I realise that the Deputy President has already stated  that  the  foot-and-
mouth disease has been another  example.  Again,  the  co-operation  between
national Government and our province during the outbreak of foot-and  mouth-
disease was also a hallmark of the best of intergovernmental relations  that
we could hope for.

We are now proudly able to announce that our province is free  of  foot-and-
mouth disease, thanks  to  co-operative  governance  and  the  support  from
national Government. We are also in a position to  give  some  news  to  the
United Kingdom which seems to be suffering from the  problem  that  we  have
already solved. [Applause.]

There is no  other  way  to  demonstrate  co-operative  governance  than  in
ensuring that our people will always emerge victorious  and  united  in  the
face of extreme challenges. These challenges that one has spoken about  have
brought our people together and made sure  that  we  could  survive  despite
those difficulties.

Another tragedy struck just when the farming community was settling down  to
count  the  cost  of  the  foot-and-mouth  outbreak  which  destroyed  their
valuable property. I think a lot of us would be aware that for  the  African
community the value of cattle is economic, cultural and spiritual, and  that
they are the embodiment of their very life  and  very  existence.  In  early
September a raging veld fire in the northern part of our province  destroyed
a lot of livestock and caused more to die  of  starvation,  causing  extreme
anguish and severe financial losses. As though this was not enough, a  spell
of cold weather with rains  and  snow  devastated  the  same  area,  causing
untold damage and losses.

The fire caused over R250 million's worth of damage on  timber  plantations,
as more than 50 000 hectares of grazing land were destroyed, while the  cold
weather caused damage of more than R43 million in livestock, that is  sheep,
cattle, goats and others.  There  was  more  than  R1,5  million  damage  in
infrastructure, involving five  district  councils  and  17  municipalities,
which is the basis on which our province requested the President to  declare
the area a disaster area.

Another issue is the scourge of HIV/Aids, which is taking its  toll  on  the
province, straining all the departments and drowning our  meagre  resources.
Again, a joint approach between the Government and civil society  and  clear
political  leadership,  from  national,  provincial  and  local   provincial
governments, has strengthened our effort to mobilise our people to face  the
problem.

The  Provincial  Aids  Council,  headed  by  our  premier,  has   encouraged
stakeholders to embark on programmes to reduce its spread. A successful  and
unique programme which focused on men resulted in a march  by  thousands  of
men pledging to play a role in the fight against Aids. Those  marching  were
political leaders, traditional and elected leaders,  religious  leaders  and
ordinary members of the community, who marched under the slogan: ``Men  make
a difference. Give her love and not Aids.''

This event was held  on  National  Women's  Day  on  9  August  and  it  was
addressed by the chairperson of Sanac, the Deputy President and the  Premier
of KwaZulu-Natal. The programme focused attention and  also  sent  a  strong
message on the problem of domestic violence,  for  the  reduction  of  which
more resources are necessary.

We are therefore also pleased to note that the FFC is now  considering  that
HIV/Aids should be a  factor  in  the  process  of  budget  allocation.  Our
province  fully  supports  the  national  Government's  focus   on   poverty
eradication, which will go a long way towards dealing with  the  problem  of
HIV/Aids and improving the lives of our people, because one of  our  biggest
problems has been that poor infrastructure and poverty have made the  impact
of any disease much worse. This has been the reason why we have had  such  a
high number of people with cholera. I think we face the  same  problem  with
HIV/Aids, because with poverty it gets worse.

The other challenge we have had to face is that  of  malaria.  The  KwaZulu-
Natal province carries more than 50% of the malaria load  of  this  country.
But,  again,  the  co-operation  of  local  government  and   the   national
Government and our local communities resulted in such  a  drastic  reduction
of this problem following  the  1999  floods,  that  KwaZulu-Natal  has  now
earned South Africa an SADC award for the best programme on the  control  of
malaria. [Applause.]
The issue that, I think, has been raised here, which continues  to  dominate
part of our political debate, is that of traditional leadership. All we  can
say right now is that this issue remains an area of concern and  tension  in
the province. Needless to  say,  there  are  also  divergent  views  amongst
political parties in the province and within the coalition  government.  We,
however, remain confident  that  the  pragmatic  approach  of  our  national
Government will ensure an amicable and  lasting  solution  to  this  matter,
which has seen very vigorous debates and public displays of disagreement.

Whilst I do not wish to underplay the  significance  of  the  focus  day  on
tourism, I will not dwell on the well-known  virtues  of  the  KwaZulu-Natal
tourism industry, as there are very few members in this  House  who  do  not
have their own personal experience of these virtues. Those members who  have
not been to KwaZulu-Natal will  eternally  regret  what  they  are  missing.
[Laughter.]

Lastly, we as the people of KwaZulu-Natal  and  of  Durban,  in  particular,
were greatly honoured to host the third World Conference against Racism.  We
believe  the  significance  of  the  conference   lay   in   it   being   an
acknowledgement by the world of the role that South Africans have played  in
fighting for nonracialism. There remains a lot of  work  for  us  to  do  in
stamping out all forms of discrimination, especially in ensuring that  young
people, particularly children at school and at home,  grow  up  without  any
form of racial prejudice.

The conference  proceeded  to  its  conclusion  without  any  disruption  or
breakdown in law and order, and the security  of  the  delegates  was  never
threatened. Almost all of the 16 000 participants left with a very  positive
feeling about South Africa. The declarations and  resolutions  adopted  will
forever be associated with our democratic new South Africa.

South Africa  was  shown  to  the  whole  world  as  a  haven  of  political
tolerance, peace and nonracialism. That was the best  show  of  co-operative
governance, as all the different spheres of government  were  involved.  Our
province is still prepared  to  accept  the  honour  of  hosting  any  other
international conference and of hosting heads of state on  behalf  of  South
Africa in the future. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, comrade  Deputy  President,  hon
premiers  and  MECs,  special  delegates,  representatives  from  Salga  and
colleagues, the hon the Deputy President may recollect that  in  his  debate
in this House a year ago, I had to mention to a  member  of  the  opposition
that he appeared to be like a cowboy riding a tired donkey into  the  sunset
firing blanks. The person that I was referring to at the time was  Mr  Peter
Marais. In fact, it appears as if it was very  prophetic  and  true.  He  no
longer is the mayor of the Cape Town unicity.

The difficulty that we faced that time, in  terms  of  the  content  of  his
contribution to the debate, was that he was not concerned about  the  nature
of the debate. The Deputy President  had  spoken  about  urban  renewal  and
integrated rural  development,  but  Mr  Marais  was  more  concerned  about
scoring political points in  a  very  vociferous  way  to  create  a  divide
between the Western Cape on the one hand and  the  other  provinces  on  the
other.

It does appear as if we now have a similar situation with Mr C B  Herandien,
the hon MEC for housing. He seems to have used his speech  to  showcase  the
Western Cape. Quite clearly, the intention  of  the  Constitution  was  that
provinces would be established and created not as  competing  fiefdoms,  the
one against the other, but as efficient instruments of  government  to  make
government accessible to our people so that we could  enhance  participatory
democracy.

The reality that was accepted by all provinces alike  was  that  development
in the provinces was asymmetrical. Certain areas had historical  advantages.
Certain areas had  used  influx  control  to  ensure  that  privileges  were
extended to people of a particular racial group.

To showcase a  province  now,  on  the  basis  of  advantages  that  it  has
incurred, is quite wrong. I respectfully feel that one should not, like  the
proverbial ostrich, bury one's head in the  sand  and  forget  that  one  is
living in one united South Africa.

The mere response of Mr Ackermann when Mr Ramatlakane  spoke,  the  hostile,
aggressive approach towards him, is an indication of the fact that there  is
a denial and unwillingness to accept the truth. In fact, the DA  does  care.
I do not think that Mr Ramatlakane has worry about money  being  spent  from
the budget. It cares about those  who  are  privileged  and  those  who  are
white. It should care more about those that are  disadvantaged,  those  that
come from the coloured  areas  and  those  Africans  who  are  suffering  in
informal settlements.

I think the central key to our democracy is caring and responsiveness.  Once
we achieve that, we will fundamentally understand the purpose of  the  NCOP,
because this institution has to prove to  be  somewhat  different  from  the
National Assembly  or  any  other  institution.  In  this  institution  when
matters, however contentious they are, are debated - this has happened  over
the past two years - the debate has concluded with  a  resolution  that  has
been adopted by all provinces and all political parties affirming a  common,
united position. We say that this is the House of Ubuntu. This is the  House
where divergent views are expressed and  articulated,  but  where  consensus
can be found.

If this is the defining character of the NCOP, it  must,  in  fact,  be  the
defining character of intergovernmental relationships  among  provinces  and
among  the  different  spheres  of  government.  When  we  talk  about   our
commitment to  housing,  that  commitment  must  prevail  not  only  in  the
Northern Province but also in the Western Cape, Gauteng  and  elsewhere.  We
cannot talk about advancements of technology in a particular  area  and  say
we are doing better than the other provinces.  We  should  rather  laud  the
achievement   of   Gauteng,   which,    notwithstanding    its    historical
disadvantages, it is able to provide more than 90% of its schools  -  public
schools, not private Model C schools -  with  computers  and  IT.  That,  in
fact, is an achievement that says: Here is a redress  of  the  disadvantages
and inequalities of the past. This is a  province  that  is  moving  forward
because of its commitment to transformation and development.

In the nature of this House, I think that  there  is  an  open  and  candid,
frank  way  to  deal  with  matters.  I  think  a  concern  has  been  quite
legitimately raised by Mr Matthee. The concern was  in  terms  of  the  Bill
that has been introduced, but Mr Matthee seems  to  be  missing  the  point,
which is that we take pride in our democracy, a democracy  which  makes  the
articulation of that particular view that he is  expressing  in  this  House
possible because of public hearings.

It makes it possible for Mr Darkie Africa to come to  a  public  hearing  of
Parliament and speak as an MEC  concerned  about  a  particular  issue,  not
because he is a member of  ANC,  but  because  he  is  concerned  about  the
different spheres of government  and  inter-governmental  relationships.  He
may be right, he may be wrong, but he is not denied the right to  articulate
and express a particular point of view. Here we see provinces able  to  come
to the national forum to express that.

What Mr Matthee should understand is that one  cannot  look  at  legislation
from a particular perspective. One should ask, for  example,  when  we  talk
about interventions in terms of section 139: Is the amendment going to  have
the effect of limiting the role of the NCOP or, honestly,  is  it  going  to
have the effect of expanding the  role?  Have  we  debated  that  particular
issue? What the amendment does, is to say  that  we  can  intervene  at  any
time, and it gives us that latitude, but  there  may  be  a  counterargument
which says that section 139, as it exists within the framework, is quite  in
order and quite adequate, and there may be alternative mechanisms  that  one
has to look at.

I think what this kind of debate has done, in terms of the  discussions  and
engagements at the public hearings where both the  Houses  participated,  is
that it has brought to our attention the fact that we are dealing with  very
complex  and  difficult  constitutional  issues.  Before  we  even  consider
adopting the legislation, we should consider whether various  other  options
could be canvassed in order to find the best  possible  solutions  so  that,
wherever possible, we do not tinker with the  Constitution.  If  Mr  Matthee
did, in fact, have an opportunity - and I think  this  House  will  have  an
opportunity - to debate this matter at length, I  believe  that  the  Deputy
President would take into account the concerns  that  have  been  raised  in
this regard. The final word has not been spoken.

I would like to take this opportunity to raise  certain  things.  I  do  not
want to sound like a praise singer, but we must thank the Deputy  President,
in his  capacity  as  Leader  of  Government  Business,  for  assisting  and
supporting the initiative  to  introduce  section  76  legislation  in  this
House.

It has brought a tremendous amount of  enthusiasm  amongst  communities.  It
has affected provincial legislatures in a very pronounced way in  that  they
look at legislation with much greater interest  and  passion,  because  they
know they are able to shape the legislation.

What seems to be the case now is that most of the amendments are,  in  fact,
being initiated by the NCOP as  a  representative  of  the  provinces.  Very
little of that is happening in the National Assembly once  it  receives  the
legislation, which means that the provinces have really shaped  and  changed
the legislation in terms of their  experience.  It  also  enables  provinces
then to have public hearings, so  when  public  hearings  are  held  in  the
National Assembly, the views of  provinces  have  already  been  taken  into
account.

I also believe that one area that perhaps should be looked at  in  terms  of
intergovernmental relations is the area of co-ordination,  which  Mr  Darkie
Africa raised. I think it is a very important area. But certainly,  the  two
central issues  regarding  intergovernmental  relations,  particularly  with
respect to the new  municipal  structures  and  new  dispensation,  are  the
following: Firstly, the provincial governments would now  have  to  redefine
their roles, and have to play a much more integrated role in  terms  of  how
they deal with  the  budget.  It  also  means  that  local  governments  and
district  councils  would  provide   provincial   governments   with   their
integrated development plans  and  their  proposed  budgets.  Those  budgets
would, in fact, determine the  priorities  of  the  province.  The  province
would look at the programmes,  the  needs  and  the  requirements  of  local
governments and then, on that basis, would be able to determine these.

In order to monitor and ensure that this occurs in an integrated way, it  is
important that we have linkages with local government.  Here  I  think  that
IT, which we had to grapple with in the NCOP in the past and which has  been
so beneficial to us in engaging very  meaningfully  and  actively  with  our
provinces,  would  be  a  very  key  and  central  instrument  in  terms  of
monitoring, in terms of oversight.

It has been a very long debate but  I  have  to  say  that  this  House  has
responded to the call of the Deputy President. To give a  few  examples:  We
have tried to establish a provincial focus. We also have tried to  establish
that we are responsive.  The  Deputy  President  has  raised  the  issue  of
disasters,   which   was   a   classical   phenomenon   or   expression   of
intergovernmental relationships. This House  went  to  the  disaster  areas,
exercised oversight there, invited the different spheres,  including  Salga,
to participate in debates, compiled a report and  submitted  the  report  to
the executive, which I believe had some kind  of  impact  in  terms  of  the
process of  intergovernmental  relations,  horizontally  and  vertically  in
terms of disaster management.

In terms of the matters that were raised by the hon  the  Deputy  President,
regarding  urban  renewal  and  integrated  rural  development,  this  House
intends setting aside dedicated  time  for  provincial  legislatures,  local
government  and  the  NCOP.  We  will  also  extend  an  invitation  to  our
counterparts in the NA to  visit  those  areas  and  to  see  what  are  the
successes, challenges and  difficulties  that  are  encountered.  We,  as  a
legislature, would be able to respond to  government  action  in  the  three
spheres with regard to priorities that we have all accepted  and  that  have
been set by our President. This is amongst the  other  issues  that  we  are
going to raise.

The previous speaker raised the importance of the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal
Review. I think one of the important features of that particular area -  and
premiers, MECs and members of the legislatures  who  are  here  should  take
note of this - is that for the first time, there is going to be an  analysis
of key social areas such as education, local  government  and  health.  That
analysis has never been done before in the manner in which  it  will  appear
in the report. It means that it will reflect the determination of  provinces
in terms of programmes and priorities that provinces  have  to  accept.  The
report will therefore be one which all provinces  should  engage  with,  and
could then be developed  by  the  NCOP  as  representative  of  the  various
provinces  and  representing  also  the  local   sphere   and   be   debated
meaningfully here.

With these few words, I would like to thank the premiers, the  chief  Whips,
the MECs and the members of  the  legislatures  for  the  support  and  also
acknowledge Salga for their participation. We do believe that  in  the  near
future, given the fact that it  has  had  teething  problems  with  its  new
structure, Salga will be able to  participate  much  more  meaningfully  and
effectively in the work of this council.

Mr B H VILAKAZI (Salga): Deputy President,  Chairperson,  hon  delegates  to
the NCOP, premiers, MECs, executive  mayors  and  representatives  of  local
government who are part of this debate and discussion this afternoon, it  is
indeed an honour for me to deliver what could be called a maiden  speech  on
behalf of Salga in this  important  debate,  as  introduced  by  the  Deputy
President of the country. May I  start  by  tendering  the  apology  of  the
chairperson of  Salga,  the  executive  mayor  of  Pretoria-Tshwane,  Father
Mkhatshwa, who could not be with us this afternoon.

South Africa's municipal elections, held on  5  December  2000,  closed  the
chapter of transitional local government and therefore marked the dawn of  a
new era for municipalities in this country. Until 1994 the vast majority  of
our people had been denied the right to elect the representatives  of  their
choice.

Local government in South Africa is a very critical  sphere  of  government.
It is tasked with the responsibility to serve  the  people  and  to  provide
essential social and economic services to the communities. Section 40(1)  of
the Constitution captures this new  constitutional  status  of  the  various
spheres of government as follows:


  In the Republic, government is constituted as  national,  provincial  and
  local spheres of government which  are  distinctive,  interdependent  and
  interrelated.

The Constitution spells out the developmental role and the mandate of  local
government in terms of its objects, which are, according to section 152(1):
  (a)  to  provide  democratic  and   accountable   government   to   local
       communities;


  (b) to ensure the provision of services to communities in a   sustainable
       manner;


  (c) to promote social and economic development;


  (d) to promote a safe and healthy environment; and


  (e) encourage the involvement of communities and community  organisations
       in the matters of local government.

We should also add to this  the  ward  committees  structure.  This  mandate
places local government at the centre of service delivery. Local  government
can only rise to  this  challenge  if  municipalities  are  financially  and
institutionally empowered. Local government cannot fulfil its  developmental
mandate without being  part  of  the  national  and  provincial  development
agenda. All spheres of government must, in  line  with  the  spirit  of  co-
operative governance, co-operate with one  another  by  fostering  relations
with one another and enriching and  fostering  successful  budget  processes
and management through the now established national  budget  forum  and  the
Financial and Fiscal Commission.

One of the critical requirements of all municipalities in the country is  to
produce IDPs and the value of IDPs, for the municipalities  is  embedded  in
the  formulation  of  focused  plans  that  are   based   on   developmental
priorities. This approach will endorse a system that entails  the  directing
of resources to areas where they are needed most, maximising our  capacities
in  improved  service  delivery  in  all  our  communities  to  remove   the
inequalities and imbalances of the past.

Municipalities are also required to align their plans  with  the  provincial
and  national  spheres  of  government  in  the  delivery  of  national  and
provincial development plans at local level.  Municipalities  also  have  to
incorporate a wide range of  sectoral  programmes  like  water,  health  and
small business development into their own municipal  development  programmes
and also comply with the requirements of a  range  of  national  legislation
aimed at facilitating development.

For this  to  succeed,  co-operative  governance  and  a  proper  system  of
intergovernmental relations  are  very  critical.  Without  all  spheres  of
government adhering to the principles of Chapter 3 of the  Constitution,  we
cannot succeed alone in local government. We need to promote and  develop  a
close  working  relation  between  the  spheres  of  government  and   bring
governance close to the people.

Salga is a statutory body broadly mandated to represent local government  at
national level. This mandate stems from section  163  of  the  Constitution,
which recognises an important role of  organised  local  government  in  the
South African sociopolitical landscape. In  line  with  this  constitutional
provision, the Organised Local Government Act was passed  by  Parliament  in
November 1997.

The NCOP, by virtue of its status, plays an important role as an  instrument
of intergovernmental relations. Salga,  as  a  representative  of  organised
local government and the third sphere of government recognised by the  South
African Constitution, takes part in  all  NCOP  activities  affecting  local
government.

Salga's role in the NCOP, therefore, is to represent the interests of  local
government at national level,  and  specifically  the  national  legislative
process, and to advise other spheres of government on  the  implications  of
various pieces of legislations and policies that affect local government.

Organised local government's role is to be the direct link between the  NCOP
and municipalities. However, Salga faces a number of challenges in its  role
of  representing   local   government   in   the   legislative   branch   of
intergovernmental relations.

The intergovernmental relations audit report commissioned by the  Department
of Provincial and Local Government  identified  some  key  issues  hampering
Salga's  participation  in  the  NCOP.  Amongst  these   were   the   NCOP's
legislative cycle, the lack of resources and infrastructure, the absence  of
permanent  delegates  and  the   lack   of   participation   in   provincial
legislatures.

With  local  government  covering  the  whole  country,  it   is   therefore
imperative that we find ways and means and processes  to  make  it  possible
for local government to  meet  the  deadlines  as  dictated  by  the  NCOP's
session cycles in terms of obtaining the required mandates,  even  from  the
most remote parts of this country.

Through joint workshops we need to be able to  identify  and  put  in  place
mechanisms  to  provide  for  enough  time  for  consultation  with   member
municipalities once legislation has entered the cycle  and  amendments  have
been effected to the Bill.

Salga, as a national structure, represents and acts as  a  voice  for  local
government. Therefore, if Salga is to speak  for  local  government,  proper
consultation with even the smallest of the municipalities should take  place
before  the  local  government's  position  can  be  tabled  as   input   to
Parliament.

We welcome the comments of the hon Sulliman and agree that there  is  indeed
a more meaningful role that needs to be played by Salga in this  legislative
process. However, I again  want  to  note  that  the  absence  of  permanent
delegates and the lack of resources should inform us on the urgent  need  to
address this matter mutually in order to capacitate  and  enhance  organised
local government's participation in the NCOP.

Unlike provinces, Salga does not have  members  permanently  at  Parliament.
This problem reduces our ability to critically analyse the  implications  of
each piece of legislation with implications for local government.  It  tends
to be too costly for Salga to ferry  delegates  to  and  from  provinces  to
Parliament each time such legislation finds its way into the cycle.
Due  to  the  lack  of  local   government   participation   in   provincial
legislatures and the  absence  of  voting  rights  in  the  NCOP  for  local
government, Salga has not been  able  to  submit  a  negotiating  and  final
mandate as provincial legislatures do.

In conclusion I want to say that we appreciate and accept the invitation  to
continue our participation in the doings of the NCOP. Today's  participation
in this debate should facilitate  Salga's  continued  participation  in  the
NCOP. This will enable municipalities to make inputs into  various  policies
and pieces of legislation that impact on local  government  to  ensure  that
local government is able to fulfil its developmental role.

Proper intergovernmental  relations  structures  and  mechanisms  should  be
established at both a legislative and executive level  within  provinces  to
ensure that  co-operative  governance  starts  at  provincial  level.  Salga
welcomes the establishment  of  different  forums  in  different  provinces,
bringing together premiers, mayors, MECs and organised local  government  to
enhance governance and co-operative governance. Intergovernmental  relations
are  therefore  critical  for  the  proper  implementation   of   government
policies. All of us must adhere to these principles for such  implementation
to succeed.

Lastly, Salga would like to congratulate the Deputy President on this  long-
awaited debate and its success through his participation this afternoon.

We want to join those who have extended  goodwill  wishes  to  Premier  Popo
Molefe for  a  speedy  recovery  from  what  seems  to  have  been  a  major
operation. We also want to join everyone  in  the  House  in  congratulating
Premier Manne Dipico on the  evident  sudden  growth  in  the  size  of  the
population of his province and his contribution through  the  birth  of  his
daughter.

With that we want to thank you for the opportunity and for  welcoming  Salga
back into the NCOP. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE NORTHERN PROVINCE  (Adv  N  A  Ramatlhodi):  Chairperson,
Deputy President and colleagues, I wish to use this occasion to  join  those
who have acknowledged the  presentation  by  the  Deputy  President  of  the
Republic of South Africa.

The initiated would know that our Constitution is a  product  of  sufficient
consensus. In that sense it represents  the  minimum  commonly  agreed  upon
positions  by  various  units,  class  forces,  groups  and  others.  It  is
therefore based on the mutual accommodation of all these interests.

Given that it is an embodiment of the collective will of our people, it  has
been successful in producing the stability that our country enjoys.  We  are
therefore enjoined not  only  to  promote  the  letter  and  spirit  of  the
Constitution to the best of our abilities, but  indeed  to  be  seen  to  be
doing so.

At the heart of our dispensation is the notion of  the  communal  management
of various institutions catered for  under  the  Constitution.  That  notion
derives from the saying which was formulated by our ancestors 46  years  ago
when they said that the people shall govern.  We  have  thus  created  these
institutions  to  enable  our  people  to  govern  themselves.  Co-operative
governance therefore is not an options, it is indeed an imperative.

If we look at co-operative governance in a vertical sense, that  is  between
and amongst the three spheres of government,  there  are  given  instruments
which  allow  for  the  seniors  amongst  equals  to  exercise  an   overall
oversight. That notion  is  normally  referred  to  as  national  norms  and
standards, meaning that all of us  should  conform  to  uniform  and  single
norms and standards.

Normally these norms and standards would then belong to the  province  of  a
particular  Minister  who  would  therefore  have  the   responsibility   of
determining  what  constitutes  common  norms  and  standards  -  not   only
determining, but applying those common norms and standards or  alternatively
ensuring that they are being adhered to.

That is the role of the national Ministers of the Republic.

In playing this role, the national Ministers might, at times, be tempted  to
cross the sacred line and find themselves compromising the  principle  which
goes together with that of interrelatedness, which  is  distinctiveness.  As
we implement co-operative governance,  we  should  therefore  guard  against
that possibility.

Similarly, local and provincial governments have a duty  and  an  obligation
to co-operate with the norms and standards of a country. As I  said,  it  is
not an option. In co-operating, they also have a  duty  to  make  sure  that
they remain distinct within the confines of the Constitution.

Sometimes provinces and local governments might  want  to  hide  behind  the
notion of autonomy in order to avoid adherence to the norms  and  standards.
What we need to look at is that those of us  who  are  at  different  levels
have equal responsibilities in the communal management of our country.
I will come to horizontal co-operative governance. Let us take the  national
sphere,  for  example,  between  the  departments  which  are   within   the
provincial sphere. The tendency  is  for  the  departments  to  seek  to  be
sailors on their own, and for the Ministers or MECs to compete and  outshine
one another. That undermines co-operative governance.

What is required is what we have tried to do,  namely  make  sure  that  the
cluster system is perfected to its  highest  efficiency,  at  least  at  the
provincial and national levels. I am sure that local  government  will  find
that it will not necessarily need to  reinvent  the  wheel,  but  rather  to
enrich what we are in the process of creating.

Regarding co-operative  governance  between  provinces,  earlier  on  I  was
listening to some  the  debates  here  and  I  was  reminded  of  a  peacock
performing a mating dance before a peahen. [Laughter.]

We have a common responsibility to manage  these  provinces  communally  and
collaboratively. We should not take pride in the fact that  some  are  ahead
and others are behind. [Interjections.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Why not?

The PREMIER OF THE NORTHERN PROVINCE (Adv N A Ramatlhodi): We  should  worry
about what we all do communally to  bring  along  those  who  are  backward.
[Applause.] That is at the heart of co-operative governance.

We know that different parts of our  country  are  at  different  levels  of
development, and that has been authored by our own history.  Either  we  had
something to do with it or we did not, but that is  the  objective  reality.
If we want to build a stable, sustainable and prosperous nation,  we  should
stop laughing at ourselves, because when one laughs at one's  brothers,  one
is laughing at oneself.

Those of us who are behind have a responsibility not to pull back those  who
are in front. As they give a helping hand, we must  follow  and  make  their
task easier by doing our bit and not blaming history.

I thought that I should address the broad principles, rather  than  go  into
the details of what we do in the Northern Province. There are  things  which
are very similar to most of what has been said here.

Ms  C-S  BOTHA:  Madam  Chair,  hon  Deputy  President,  special  delegates,
premiers and hon members ... [Interjections.] I always do, madam.  You  must
listen. [Interjections.]

The NCOP is seldom privileged to have the Deputy President in  our  Chamber.
Therefore, I would have thought  that  we  could  use  this  opportunity  to
discuss matters of more immediate relevance so as to share his views.

Luister! [Listen!]
Instead, we are debating a subject that was already exhaustively studied  by
the Ministry and the Department of Provincial and Local Government in  1999.
At that time, its report concluded that a clear  conception  of  the  NCOP's
mandate and greater focus  on  its  potential  to  enhance  the  quality  of
intergovernmental relations were needed. But since we are  now  deliberating
on intergovernmental relations, it would help  if  we  had  clarity  on  the
future of both the NCOP and provinces. [Interjections.]

Uncertainty is fuelled by remarks such as those of Premier Stofile that  the
current governmental structures are going to cause a  lot  of  problems  ...
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! What is out of order, Madam?

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, what is out of order is codes of conduct. It  is
unbecoming for this prestigious place to have  an  hon  member  saying,  ``I
always do, you must listen.''  It  sounds  arrogant  and  not  courteous.  I
therefore ask that we respect  this  place  and  discontinue  messages  like
that.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The point is  taken.  The  member  may
continue. I have noted the point.

Ms C-S BOTHA: Uncertainty is fuelled by remarks such  as  those  of  Premier
Stofile that the current governmental structures are going to  cause  a  lot
of problems, as well as similar sentiments by another premier quoted in  the
report as having said:


  I am  doubtful  of  the  Government's  commitment  to  the  NCOP  or  the
  provincial system of Government.

If these doubts are laid to rest, it will result in greater  legitimacy  for
these new democratic structures, and greater respect for  the  Constitution,
as well as the rights and obligations of citizens. But if the future of  the
main actors is not secured ... [Interjections.] I care about  democracy  and
hope that the member does too. But, if the future of the main actors is  not
secured, intergovernmental relations will remain fluid.

Currently  there  is  a  big  debate  around  the  proposed   constitutional
amendments before this Parliament. I am glad that the  hon  Surty  supported
the hon Matthee in  raising  these  issues.  I  certainly  intend  doing  so
myself, and I disagree with the previous Chair, who thought that  they  were
not relevant.

These amendments will allow the national Government the right  to  intervene
in the executive and legislative functions of local authorities, as well  as
downgrading the role  of  the  FFC.  Throughout  the  hearings  of  the  ...
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  member,  there  is  a  point  of
order.

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, it has already been ruled in  this  House  that
the speakers are pre-empting a matter that is  about  to  come  before  this
House, and this is against the Rules. It is not up to a  member  to  decide.
The Chair has already made a ruling. The previous speaker was out of  order,
and this speaker is continuing to be out of order. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! At the moment  the  member  is  right.
The matter is still to be tabled in  the  House.  [Interjections.]  Can  you
carry on, hon member, but noting that the matter is  still  to  be  debated?
[Interjections.]

Ms C-S BOTHA: [Inaudible.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I am saying so. Dorothy, please! Oh  no,  and
I have the right to ask the ushers to  take  you  out.  [Laughter.]  Member,
continue. The member may continue,  but  not  on  a  matter  that  is  still
expected to be tabled. That is my ruling.

Ms C-S BOTHA: Madam  Chair,  I  accept  your  ruling  but  I  find  it  very
difficult to ignore what is currently going on in this Parliament, as if  it
were not relevant to this  debate.  I  therefore  suggest  that  Mr  Surty's
support of Mr Matthee was proper and that I should be allowed  to  continue.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, this is defiance of a  ruling  of
the Chair. [Interjections.]

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, I asked the Chair to make a  ruling  that  this
was contempt of the House, and the member  is  defying  a  decision  of  the
Chair. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I have said that I have made  a  ruling.  Hon
member, you only have a half a  minute.  Carry  on.  You  have  30  seconds.
[Laughter.]

Ms C-S BOTHA: Madam Chair, I object. I actually object to having 30  seconds
left. I had six minutes to speak, of which most was taken  up  by  positions
that are really not supposed to have been held in this House. Therefore,  30
seconds does not ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon  member,  I  asked  you  to  continue  to
debate.
Ms C-S BOTHA: Good, Chair, I will proceed then with why I  think  we  should
consider both the position for interventions at the moment and  those  being
tabled in the House. I will proceed with an example. I submit that there  is
something of a provincial paralysis resulting from  the  lack  of  political
will to expose existing shortcomings, both at provincial  and  local  level.
These  may  be  personal  or  institutional,  but  their  net  effect  is  a
profligate waste of money, and likely to lead to a constitutional breach  in
the delivery of services at the end of the road. I  have  cut  out  a  large
slice of my speech.

I want to give hon members the example of Ngwathe municipality in  the  Free
State this past fortnight. It has run up debts  of  which  those  that  have
reached crisis proportions  amount  to  over  R16  million.  This  does  not
include their rescheduled  debt  to  the  DBSA,  on  which  it  has  already
defaulted. To prevent seizure of their assets by the  Free  State  Municipal
Pension Fund, they had to obtain an interdict,  which  is  concomitant  with
cost implications. This situation tends  to  shed  a  sympathetic  light  on
Treasury's requested amendments.

Madam Chair, I am not sure about my time now.  Is  it  30  seconds  or  not?
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, I have the duty  to  say  whether
your time is over or not.

Ms C-S BOTHA: However, to give substance ... Pardon?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, Sandra, I have the duty  to  tell
you when your time is up. I have not told you so. [Interjections.]

Ms C-S BOTHA: Thank you, Madam Chair. However, to give substance  and  shape
to the provisions of co-operative governance, lack  of  capacity,  at  which
door too many failures of political will are laid, should be addressed  with
concrete plans.

The DBSA is one entity that may well be able to make a  significant  impact.
Until such time, much of the discussions around principles ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time is over. [Applause.]

Ms C-S BOTHA: I find that extraordinary.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time is over.

Ms N C  KONDLO  (Eastern  Cape):  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  President,  the
premiers  present  if  there  are  any  at  this  stage,  hon  members,  the
delegation or representatives from Salga ...

... ndifuna ukuqala ngokuthi ndicelele iNkulumbuso yephondo leMpuma  Koloni,
uMfu Stofile, uxolo kule Ndlu nakuSekela  Mongameli  ngokuba  engekho  nathi
apha kule Ndlu. [... I would like to begin by apologizing  for  the  Premier
of the Eastern Cape, Rev Stofile, to this House and to the Deputy  President
for his absence in this House today.]
It is almost five years since the new Constitution  was  adopted  and  great
strides have been taken in our new democracy.  Co-operative  governance  and
positive  intergovernmental  relations   are   the   cornerstones   of   the
Constitution and our maturing democracy.

To ensure that the current momentum in promoting democracy and  co-operation
is maintained, it is  imperative  that  we  reinforce  the  structures  that
promote intergovernmental relations and  co-operation.  To  ensure  that  we
succeed in building a better life for all the people of  this  country,  co-
operation among the three spheres of government should be greatly  enhanced.
This will contribute immensely  to  good  governance  and  improved  service
delivery. All three spheres of government should  continue  to  nurture  co-
operative governance. This route will definitely ensure the  vision  of  the
ANC-led Government.

As  a  province,  we  have  taken  a  resolution  to  continually  lay   the
foundations for us to succeed in promoting these  relations.  To  that  end,
we, as a province, have already established  the  forum  that  will  improve
what we are here to debate.

In terms of the Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa  and  the
mandate given  to  the  ANC-led  Government  by  the  electorate,  the  core
objective of the Government is  to  deliver  services  to  our  people.  The
province of the  Eastern  Cape  resolved,  after  identifying  that  service
delivery is unco-ordinated  and  haphazard,  to  establish  a  structure  to
address this  anomaly.  National  departments  in  the  province  and  local
government have been engaged in service delivery activities that were  never
known to be possible in the province of the Eastern Cape.

The executive council has mandated the director-general to  co-ordinate  the
establishment of an intergovernmental forum, and this structure has been  in
existence since  September  1999.  This  forum  brings  together  provincial
departments, national departments in  the  province,  local  government  and
parastatals both provincially and nationally. Its purpose is  to  facilitate
the co-ordination of plans  and  programmes  of  the  different  spheres  of
government within the province.

The key objective of the forum is integrated service delivery  that  is  co-
ordinated at the centre. The IDPs are the critical parts  that  inform  this
process. We are of the view that this approach will have a  positive  impact
in terms of which resources are pulled together for one good cause.

Furthermore,  this  forum  facilitates  the  economic  growth   and   social
development in the province and ensures that the current  initiatives,  such
as the integrated sustainable rural development strategy, the urban  renewal
strategy and poverty alleviation, will be effectively delivered.

The work done to date on the four nodal points that were identified  through
the national President's speech,  O  R  Tambo,  Chris  Hani,  Khahlamba  and
Alfred Nzo, are a clear example of co-operative governance in motion.

The intergovernmental  forum  has  both  the  technical  and  the  political
branches. The technical branch  is  the  part  that  drives  the  integrated
service delivery programme of the province. The secretariat  of  this  forum
is there for the purposes of implementation of the day-to-day activities  of
the structure. The IGF  will  ensure  co-operation  instead  of  competition
amongst the spheres of government and therefore ensures  prompt,  efficient,
effective and optimal service delivery.

We acknowledge that, as different spheres of government and parastatals,  we
serve the same communities, and the best way to do this is  to  enhance  co-
ordination and integration  of  planning,  as  well  as  implementation,  to
secure maximum service delivery.

The collective approach to governance will add value  to  the  establishment
of  the  developmental  local  government  as  envisaged  and  having   been
implemented since the December 5 elections. The  outcome  of  these  efforts
should be a win-win situation for both communities and Government.
The integrated service delivery approach is currently being  implemented  as
a pilot in  the  rural  municipalities  of  Emalahleni  in  the  Chris  Hani
municipality. This initiative involves institution-building,  the  provision
of economic and social  infrastructure,  and  various  economic  development
projects for sustainable development. The outcome of these initiatives  will
expand the tax base  of  the  areas  and  ensure  that  developmental  local
government is a reality.

The IGF political structure is to convene towards the end of the  year.  Its
goal will be to ensure political leadership for  the  IGF  technical  forum.
This  includes  the  identification  of  common  priorities  and  the  joint
allocation  of  financial  resources,  especially  in  respect  of   capital
projects. The Integrated Sustainable  Rural  Development  Strategy  and  the
executive  council  outreach  programme  have  managed  to  bring  both  the
provincial and local government political leadership closer  to  each  other
towards resolving some of the problems.

As the province, we appreciate the commitment and  continuous  support  that
we receive from the  national  Government  departments,  and  this  approach
should be sustained. All these positive developments  are  informed  by  our
provincial growth and development strategy and  all  key  stakeholders  have
been mobilised behind our initiatives. I am referring here to  the  business
sector and communities at large, as well as nongovernmental organisations.

The projects that we are currently pursuing have  the  potential  to  unlock
the untapped economic opportunities in the province as demonstrated  by  the
example of Koega, the Wild Coast SDI and the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural
Development Strategy that I referred to earlier. We are all  united  in  our
resolve  to  fight  poverty  and  unemployment  and  to  defeat  crime   and
corruption. [Interjections.]

We are determined to improve service delivery and mechanisms  are  in  place
to ensure that we succeed. We cannot fail  as  our  people  look  to  us  to
achieve the noble goals of a better life for all.
Our Government will continue to support other structures  that  promote  co-
operative governance. The Minmec structure, for example, is one of  the  key
noble ideas and should be seen as a consultative and  interactive  structure
rather than a structure that gives directives to provinces,  and  it  should
be seen as a structure for interaction in order to meet our challenges.

... [In addition to that, even  the  departments  that  are  represented  in
Parliament and not in the provinces ...]

... intergovernmental forums as well as co-operative  governance  should  be
able to see how best we ensure service  delivery,  as  provinces  and  local
government, in terms of engaging these  departments  whether  they  be  Home
Affairs, Justice or Labour, so that as governments that are run and  managed
nationally we are able, like the other spheres of  government,  to  have  an
impact on how resources are allocated and what it is  that  these  resources
are for, ie for a better service to our people.
The presidential consultative council plays  a  useful  role  to  bring  the
provinces  together  with  the  Presidency  to  ensure  that  there  is  co-
ordination and integration of all our efforts.  The  challenges  facing  our
legislatures and this  House  lie  more  in  ensuring  that  the  pieces  of
legislation that need our feedback as provinces are  timeously  communicated
so that, as provinces, we can give well-thought-out feedback.  At  times  we
gloss over very important policies for our democracy and at the end  of  the
day suffer reversals.

It is, however, an inspiring development that, with a young  democracy  like
ours, we have been able to strike a balance between focusing on our  spheres
of Government and promoting intergovernmental relations in the  manner  that
we have so far.

In conclusion, adherence to Chapter 3 of the Constitution, in as far as  the
Eastern  Cape  is  concerned,  is  key  to  the  success   of   co-operative
governance. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Thank you,  hon  member.  I  would  just
like to remind hon members that we do  have  a  practice  in  terms  of  the
Rules, that members do not obscure the Chair when a member  is  speaking.  I
notice that members have now begun to walk in the House in front of  members
who are actually addressing the Chair. This is unacceptable. It seems  quite
clear to me that if we are indeed members of  this  House  it  is  important
that we know the Rules, firstly, and that we observe them. So I  would  like
to ask members to please ensure that they do observe the Rules.

The PREMIER OF MPUMALANGA (Mr N J Mahlangu): Chairperson,  Deputy  President
and hon members, I would  just  like  to  share  some  ideas  regarding  our
experiences in Mpumalanga. I would start by saying that it  was  José  Rizal
who said, and I quote:


  A stone is worthless if it is not part of an edifice.

Today  we  gather  here  in  these   hallowed   portals   as   leaders   and
representatives of our respective provinces - stones in the edifice that  is
our beautiful country, South Africa. I believe that we are all in  agreement
that public attitudes towards Government and its role  have  changed  a  lot
over the past couple of years. Not only in Mpumalanga, but  also  throughout
the country the public is now more demand like to service  and  explanations
if we cannot deliver on time.

Now, some people may  want  to  know  what  brought  about  this  change  in
attitude. The answer lies in our commitment to being in daily  contact  with
the people, listening and learning from  them,  and  a  commitment  to  hold
report-back meetings so that the community can give us report cards.

In the past years we  have  been  hard  at  work  in  Mpumalanga,  fostering
friendly relations with the communities and other stakeholders. That is  why
we were able to deal in a co-ordinated manner with the floods,  the  cholera
epidemic and the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. We  would  not  have  been
able to do that without  a  strategic  plan  devised  by  all  of  us  as  a
collective. But where did it start, one may ask.

In October 1999 the Mpumalanga provincial executive council took a  decision
to embark on a programme of reaching out to people of the province.  One  of
our aims was to reach out to and  engage  communities  and  stakeholders  in
discussions around development, and  also,  for  us  as  the  executive  and
bureaucrats, local authorities and national government departments based  in
the province, to understand the dynamics and problems in the  areas  and  to
reach consensus on a broader programme of action for service delivery.

In  short,  we  are  taking  government  to  the  people.  We  believe  that
communities have become more informed about what Government does  and  about
plans put in place for future development in the province. Communities  have
come forward to appreciate efforts by government to speak to  them  face  to
face.

How do we deal  with  the  integrated  development  plan  in  the  province?
Firstly, through the outreach programme of the Mpumalanga executive  council
outlined  above,  we  fortnightly,  as  a  collective,  meet  a   particular
municipal council  and  police  station  commanders  in  a  particular  area
visited.  In  the  afternoon,  each  MEC  addresses   and   interacts   with
communities in a preplanned meeting. A full record of  this  interaction  is
kept, co-ordinated and followed up  by  the  premier's  office  through  all
affected provincial and national  departments  as  well  as  relevant  local
government structures.  Feedback  from  government  on  concerns  raised  by
communities and councils  is  given  by  the  affected  departments  in  all
instances.

The records of this feedback are also kept in the premier's office  so  that
when outreach programmes go back to the same places, answers are  ready  and
communities are reminded of the government's response.

Secondly, we have  interaction  through  cluster  committees.  In  this  way
departments are able to consult and plan  together  so  that  a  deliverable
Government programme, based on a totally integrated approach, is adopted.

As premier, I chair the  governance  and  administration  cluster  which  is
attended by the executive mayors of the province.  The  cluster  focuses  on
the element of monitoring the implementation  of  provincial  priorities  by
both spheres of government.

We also have the economy, investment and employment cluster and  the  social
services cluster. Our cluster committees are supported by technical  cluster
committees, comprising  the  respective  heads  of  departments.  The  three
district  council  municipalities  and  other  executive  mayors  also  send
representatives to both the cabinet  cluster  committee  and  the  technical
cluster committee.

Structures have been set up at provincial level to  deal  with  co-operative
governance and intergovernmental relations. The functions and activities  of
the Mpumalanga intergovernmental relations forum  are  co-ordinated  by  the
department of local government. This forum meets quarterly and  the  purpose
is to invite politicians and senior managers in municipalities to  meetings.
Matters  of  mutual  interest  affecting  municipalities,  in  a  provincial
context, are discussed at these meetings.

If matters that are not necessarily vested within the  department  of  local
government are to be discussed, role-players from other  departments  within
the province, and even from national level, are also  regularly  invited  to
address these meetings. These meetings are especially  aimed  at  discussing
policy-related matters that have an impact on service delivery and  the  co-
ordination of activities, and at reporting on issues of common interest  and
soliciting consensus in this regard.

The MEC for local government has established three different mayors'  forums
within the  province.  Municipalities  of  similar  size  and  with  similar
capacity are grouped together in the three forums. The aim  of  the  mayors'
forum is to create a structure within which the MEC and  mayors  within  the
province can meet in order to discuss matters of mutual political  interest.
This also serves to update the MEC and the  mayors  on  progress  made  with
regard to matters affecting municipalities, and also to discuss measures  to
improve their performance.

Cross-boundary district and local municipalities  were  established  between
the province of Mpumalanga, the  Northern  Province  and  Gauteng.  Although
there are  challenges  facing  these  municipalities,  such  as  having  two
authorities in one  and  the  same  municipality,  our  structures  are  co-
operating very well on the ground and it  seems  these  problems  are  being
overcome.

Again, the  MEC  for  local  government  regularly  meets  with  traditional
leaders, leaders of the local government association of Mpumalanga  and  the
Masakhane  co-ordinating  committee.  Several  municipalities  have  already
established ward committees and  a  number  of  municipalities  are  in  the
process of establishing such committees.
Our local economic development programme  strives  for  the  eradication  of
poverty and  unemployment  through  the  implementation  of  local  economic
development programmes. As a province, we are bold  in  our  ambitions  that
within this decade we will have the capacity to fight poverty.

There are serious challenges still facing us. The first one has to  do  with
the  autonomy  of  municipalities.  There  is   always   the   danger   that
intervention will sometimes be construed as  interference  or  intrusion  in
the sphere of municipalities.

The other  challenge  is  really  being  able  to  manage  the  cross-border
municipalities. We are all new in this sphere and this is a  new  phenomenon
in the country.

In  the  instances  of  the  Marble  Hall   and   Groblersdal   cross-border
boundaries, it is really cumbersome that people  living  across  the  border
with Mpumalanga should travel hundreds of  kilometres  to  Potgietersrus  in
the  Northern  Province  to  register  their  vehicles  when  there   is   a
registration office a few kilometres away in Mpumalanga. This  challenge  is
being looked at, but it is a challenge.

Regarding national departments in provinces,  one  would  like  to  see  the
greater involvement of provinces, which is sometimes not the case. To  quote
an example, the Department of Water  Affairs  and  Forestry  normally  deals
with municipalities directly regarding bulk water supply. But provinces  are
automatically drawn in by complaining  residents  once  there  are  problems
regarding water shortages. I believe that if these interactions could  start
at the planning stage, such problems could be avoided. Even the  involvement
of the province would be very meaningful  because  the  community  does  not
know about the division of national, provincial and municipal  powers.  That
co-operation between the three spheres of government is very important.

The land affairs Bill will have an impact on municipalities  and  will  most
certainly have an impact on the land facilitation  Act.  Our  department  of
local government is not directly involved with the Bill and it  is  doubtful
whether municipalities are indeed fully involved.

Finally, maybe on this,  the  first  day  of  Public  Service  Week,  it  is
important to note that the provincial Public Service has, like the  rest  of
the South African society, changed a  lot  over  the  seven  years.  I  have
noticed the difference between the Public Service that I now work  with  and
the Public Service that I worked with before 1994. I am happy  to  say  that
most of the changes that have occurred over that period of  time  have  been
beneficial.

I think there is great allegiance and commitment by the  Public  Service  to
upholding the Constitution of the Republic of South  Africa  and  the  Batho
Pele principles.

One would say  that  co-ordination  between  national  departments  and  the
province is crucial, for one cannot, when someone raises a complaint  in  an
outreach programme, say  to  the  person  that  the  matter  is  a  national
department affair and so one cannot handle it. Co-operation is there, but  I
think much can be done to improve it. [Applause.]

Mr  B  J  MKHALIPHI:  Chairperson,  His  Excellency  the  Deputy  President,
premiers and hon members, it is generally contended that there is no  single
best  model  for  co-operative  governance  and  intergovermental  relations
anywhere in the world. The way  in  which  intergovernmental  relations  are
practised is an exercise unique to each country,  which  is  rooted  in  the
social and economic context of that particular country.

In South Africa we have developed a new model  for  co-operative  governance
and intergovernmental relations,  which  is  most  appropriate  to  our  own
social, economic and political history. It is a history of  governance  that
was characterised in the past by a lack of effectiveness  and  transparency,
and  an  absence  of  accountability  and  coherence.  It   is   a   history
characterised  by  huge  disparities  in  social,  economic  and   political
development between the different sectors of our population.

Our particular system of intergovernmental relations aims to  address  these
imbalances. This is the  broad  historical  context  within  which  we  must
locate any discussion around intergovernmental  relations  and  co-operative
governance.

Co-operative governance and intergovernmental  relations  denote  a  complex
work of relationships between the different spheres of government,  on  both
a vertical and a horizontal level.

On  a  vertical  level,   intergovernmental   relations   refer   to   those
relationships between the national Government and provinces,  provinces  and
local government and national Government and local government.

On  a  horizontal  level,   intergovernmental   relations   refer   to   the
relationships between one municipal council and another, between a  district
council and another, or between one province and another.

Although the intergovernmental relationship  between  different  spheres  of
government is a complex issue, our Constitution has made it easy for  us  to
define this relationship. Chapter 3 of our Constitution  outlines  a  number
of principles which serve as a guide  for  the  implementation  of  our  own
system of relations.

In terms of these, all spheres of government  must  co-operate  and  respect
the constitutional status, institutions, powers and functions of  government
in the other spheres. All spheres of  Government  are  obliged  to  exercise
their powers and perform their functions in such  a  manner  that  does  not
encroach  on  the  geographical,  functional  or  even   the   institutional
integrity of another sphere.

In addition, these spheres should also co-operate with each other in  mutual
trust and good faith by assisting and supporting each other, consulting  one
another on matters of common interest and  by  co-ordinating  their  actions
and legislation. The success of our hybrid system of government is based  on
efficient and effective  intergovernmental  relations.  Without  these,  the
system  of  relations  may  struggle  even  to  eliminate  the   unnecessary
duplication that might still be there, or to make services  more  responsive
to local needs. Further on, it may also not be able to  empower  our  people
to participate more in decision-making processes.

This honourable House, the NCOP,  we  believe,  plays  a  critical  role  in
ensuring   the   efficiency   and   effectiveness    of    intergovernmental
relationships. This is because the NCOP has created a  particular  niche  in
its oversight and monitoring function in that it has become  the  formalised
structure in terms of which all nine provinces can bring to the  table  both
their traits and traps.

The  way  in  which  the  NCOP  fulfils   its   monitoring   and   oversight
responsibility has been primarily through  its  constitutional  obligations,
particularly those contained in sections 154, 139  and  100.  Here  we  note
that these references are being made in reverse. That is  my  interpretation
of their importance.

The  need  for  this  kind  of  intervention   and   support   arises   when
municipalities,  and/or  provinces,  do   not   exercise   their   executive
obligations in terms of the Constitution. The  interventions  in  Ogies  and
Butterworth municipalities are practical  examples  of  the  oversight  role
that the NCOP played in restoring their respective  capacities  for  service
delivery.

I must immediately contend that  it  is  difficult  to  take  this  form  of
drastic action. But, ultimately, when a province or municipality  cannot  or
even does not or is unwilling to, as  we  have  heard  in  this  House  this
afternoon, fulfil any executive obligation in terms of  legislation  or  the
Constitution, the NCOP has no other option but to intervene  by  taking  any
appropriate steps to ensure fulfilment of that obligation.

This intervention must be handled sensitively and cautiously and should  not
cause any breakdown  in  the  co-operative  governance.  This,  necessarily,
imparts on the autonomy of  provinces  and  local  government  and  has  the
potential of detrimentally affecting their relationships.  The  NCOP's  role
with regard  to  local  government  extends  beyond  interventions,  as  our
interpretations might see interventions as a negative exercise. We are  also
looking at other legislative paradigms such as  the  guidelines  offered  by
the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Systems  Act,  the   Local   Government:
Municipal Structures Act and other relevant pieces of legislation.

In terms of the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, councils  and  even
district councils are obliged to develop integrated  development  plans,  in
short, the IDPs. These IDPs are  a  framework  for  local  development  that
involves various provincial departments, such as health, housing,  transport
and many others.

Currently,  the  MEC  for  local  government  has  the   responsibility   of
monitoring and overseeing these IDPs to  ensure  that  they  correlate  with
provincial priorities, whereas the municipal councils  are  responsible  for
their implementation. It  makes,  thus,  more  sense  to  create  a  broader
structure to oversee the implementation of the IDPs.

Given the fact that the NCOP is  ideally  placed  to  provide  the  national
platform for these three spheres to come together, we could play  a  pivotal
role in merging  and  integrating  these  different  development  plans  and
priorities into a cohesive whole. Best practice  modules,  which  emerge  at
the NCOP platform, could serve  as  a  conceptual  framework  through  which
norms and standards could be duplicated in all  provinces.  I  am  referring
here  to  the  conferences  and  summits  that  we  usually  hold  with  our
counterparts in the province.

In conclusion, I understand the role of the NCOP  as  being,  to  those  who
know, like the mechanics of a vehicle, what is called a thrust bearing.  The
function of a thrust bearing is that it stabilises the  vehicle  during  the
changing of gears. In the absence of this thrust bearing, the car  will  not
move steadily forward. If one ignores this  thrust  bearing,  one  may  even
damage one's car or it will not move an inch. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Chairperson, I must thank  you  and  also  thank
the hon  members  who  have  debated  the  whole  afternoon  this  important
principle of co-operative governance. It is clear from the  inputs  that  we
have come to appreciate this principle and that  we  want  to  ensure  that,
indeed, it happens for the good of our government at all levels.

The various inputs have been made on a  number  of  issues,  some  demanding
this House to consider and others demanding other levels  of  government  to
consider. I believe, after having listened to the  contributions,  that  one
feels very comfortable and confident that this  House  does  appreciate  its
role and that it would want to ensure that this role is  effectively  played
in the process of the governance of our country.

I have always felt that this House needs quality time  to  consider  issues,
precisely because of the strategic nature of  the  House  and  where  it  is
placed in our constitutional arrangement.

I know that we all get under pressure because of time. At  times  there  are
Bills that are coming, and we have to rush.  We  have  to  receive  mandates
from the provinces, and we have to rush.  The  executive  is  keen  to  pass
legislation very quickly, and we have to rush. But  I  believe  this  House,
perhaps more than the other House, needs quality time  to  consider  matters
that are of great concern to our people. This House is placed in a  position
where it can be almost 100% objective on matters, given the fact that it  is
not like the provincial side  of  government  or  the  national  Government,
which might from time to time, as Premier Ramatlhodi  was  saying,  tend  to
overlap in a particular way.

It sits in a place where it could help to stabilise  whatever  is  happening
within the system. It therefore needs  that  quality  time  to  ensure  that
indeed people exercise power, participate and have  access.  I  do  not  see
that any other House could do that without some prejudice  of  one  kind  or
another. Here, one  sits  with  members  of  Parliament  from  the  National
Assembly  who  participate,  as  well  as  provincial  members   and   local
government members. It is a unique position that history, in  terms  of  our
Constitution, has allocated this House. It is therefore an  important  House
and I think we need to emphasise this, and  therefore  say,  whether  people
are rushing, on whatever side of the  House,  we  should  be  a  stabilising
factor so that we do  not  commit  mistakes,  but  do  things  properly  and
satisfy everyone.

I think it is here, under one roof in one joint meeting,  that  when  people
look at the debate, they see all levels  of  government  debating  a  single
issue.  It  is  therefore  very  important  indeed.  I  believe   that   the
discussions that have taken place probably give the  answer  to  a  question
that was raised by one  speaker:  What  is  the  future  of  the  NCOP,  the
provincial governments or provinces? I did  not  detect  in  the  discussion
that there was any doubt on the part of members here  about  the  importance
of this House. What I detected was a lot of input and motivation  concerning
how one would ensure that this House does its work to  strengthen  democracy
and communication in the country.

I doubt the question warrants to be answered or even to be asked, because  I
believe that  the  contributions  from  the  different  parties  to  debates
indicate the importance of this House. Who, then, would come  and  say  this
House is not important? Where shall that person come from? I  take  it  that
people who have been making inputs here come from all parties. If there  are
people who have any doubt, I think it is important that they listen  to  the
debates, because I am sure they will then be in a position to  realise  what
happens. After all, it is an important element,  if  not  ingredient,  of  a
democratic system that ensures broader participation by the people.

Within our system, the Council is also the place  that  ensures  interaction
and interconnection between the different levels, so  that  they  gel,  they
dovetail, and we are able to govern this country as one people. I think  the
principles that Premier Ramatlhodi raised  in  relation  to  how  much  each
level  should  respect  the  other  and  help  the  other  is  an  important
principle, given our history, where we come from, and how much  we  need  to
be engaged in the transformation and reconstruction of  our  country  rather
than to move in a different direction. This  House  helps  to  cement  that.
That is why I believe it needs to have more time and not  to  be  rushed  by
us, because at times we rush because we think that  we  need  to  do  things
immediately.

I am very thankful for the inputs  that  were  made  on  different  aspects.
Members have raised a number of important issues. I was happy to hear  those
inputs that say that specific attention will be given to the  Urban  Renewal
Strategy and the Integrated Sustainable Rural  Development  Programme.  That
pleases me indeed, because it is this House that must ensure that  decisions
and programmes of the Government are indeed implemented and  that  there  is
co-ordination and integration, as the programmes suggest.

I am very  happy  that  members  have  indeed  considered  it  important  to
allocate specific time and pay specific attention to these areas. It  is  my
considered view that if we  succeed  with  these  two  programmes,  we  will
certainly, within a short space of time, see a difference and change in  the
quality of life of our people.
I am also pleased to hear that the members are going to undertake  a  fiscal
review of the intergovernmental situation. That is  very  important  because
Government  on  its  own,  without  finances,  is  not  a  government.   The
Government is judged by whether it is succeeding or not  in  the  manner  in
which it handles its fiscal systems.

If members review this particular aspect, they are in fact checking  whether
the Government is operating properly. Are we able to  deliver?  Do  we  have
any shortcomings? It is only then that we can  realise  whether  departments
are spending or not, or delivering  or  not.  It  is,  again,  an  important
factor and I hope it will inform us, particularly at executive  level.  Once
we do the review, which I believe will be  objective,  we  will  know  where
there have been shortcomings.

Some issues have been raised which, as I say, are important, but one  cannot
respond to all of them. One of the issues that has been raised, I  think  by
two speakers, is the issue that relates to traditional leaders. I think  one
speaker talked about the relationship  between  traditional  leadership  and
Government. I would again say this House should  concern  itself  with  that
issue and try to help,  if  anything,  by  discussing  it  and  making  some
inputs.

I think it is an issue that really affects all of us,  probably  more  Salga
at the level of the districts. It is an issue on which we  cannot  stand  by
and watch and not participate. They might  have  a  solution  or  contribute
towards a solution. I thought it was important that we underline the  issue,
but something needs to be done about it.

Actions are being considered and I have had a meeting with the  subcommittee
of the Cabinet that is handling this matter. The Cabinet has  given  it  the
responsibility, and very soon  I  will  be  participating  in  organising  a
meeting between the traditional leaders' representatives and that  committee
to look into the  issues  again.  This  is  done  in  conjunction  with  the
committee. It will also be important for this House to  concern  itself  and
discuss the matter, because it relates again  to  the  manner  in  which  we
govern this country, in particular at the level of local government.

With regard to the  relationship  between  the  Government  and  traditional
leaders, I am sure that at the right time we might come back  when  we  have
got some distance on the issue. It is important not to look  at  that  issue
as one that relates to the national government or a specific department.  We
should all embrace it and try  to  find  a  solution.  I  doubt  that  as  a
country, having gone through such difficult issues, we could  fail  on  this
one. We cannot fail. We will find a solution. This House can also appeal  to
all of those who participate not to become too emotional and  angry,  as  it
happens at times. They might listen better if one puts across wise words  to
them.

Having said all of that, all that really remains is to express  appreciation
and also to indicate that I listened very attentively to  what  the  members
of this Council were saying as a contribution to the debate.  The  issue  of
co-operative governance is a dynamic issue, a living issue  that  we  should
talk about, not only today, but from time to time. We need to  put  together
our views and dovetail our understanding and have  a  common  view  of  what
needs to be done by different layers of government as well as ourselves.

The participation of Salga is very important. When I came here as an  MEC  I
used to listen again and again to  Salga  saying  that  they  did  not  have
resources and did not know how to achieve. I think  something  ought  to  be
done to consider this. Perhaps Salga itself could try  to  budget  for  this
particular activity.  Salga  is  no  longer  just  a  small  thing.  It  has
unicities. Some of them very rich. It is a  question  of  budgeting  for  it
rather than saying, ``Please help us.'' I think  it  is  important  that  we
note that. Their participation here, almost on a permanent kind of basis  in
the form  in  which  they  are,  again  enhances  the  interaction  and  the
democratic practice and culture in which we talk and get to  know  what  has
happened.

I would be very keen, for example, on this House in  future  being  able  to
get a kind of report or a briefing on what is  happening  nationally  in  so
far as different sectors are concerned where they operate. In  this  way  we
may get a fair idea, given in a composite kind of a report as a briefing  to
this House. I take it as an important kind of an element and I am  therefore
saying to the mayor that he should go back to the other mayors,  since  some
of them run very huge budgets, and find out if they can work  out  something
among themselves.

I was also pleased to see the number of premiers here  today,  but  not  yet
fully satisfied, because they were not all here. If there  is  any  occasion
at national level that really belongs to the premiers,  to  me  it  is  this
occasion. Their having other arrangements on this day is not, I think,  very
welcome. [Applause.] They ought to prioritise this.  It  is  important  that
they be able to come here and share views with us  and  also  hear  what  we
say. I know that they have a possibility and opportunity to meet  when  they
meet with the President, but, given the nature of the House,  I  think  they
should prioritise this. I would be very happy if they  were  able  to  come,
all of them, when we have such debates.

As hon members know, the President also comes  here,  and  I  am  sure  they
ought to be here when  the  President  is  here.  At  times  even  when  the
President is here they are not all here. I am  hoping  that  the  colleagues
from the provinces will certainly raise this point,  because  I  think  that
although we have not raised it very strongly, it is important.

In a sense, it indicates  and  demonstrates  their  respect  for  their  own
constitutions that they have taken an oath to, as well as  respect  for  the
government system, as it were, and for Parliament. From their level I  think
it is important that they take this very seriously, so  that  they  give  it
the dignity and respect it needs, and are able to participate and listen.

I would say that if they come here, they should actually spend the night  in
Cape Town. One of the issues is that they speak, other  premiers  listen  to
them, and then they go without listening to other premiers. I do  not  think
it is fair. [Applause.] We know of the date some  time  ahead,  so  I  think
they could adjust their diaries.

I am merely making an appeal because I think this is important. If  they  do
not come here, if the very people who ought to be taking it  most  seriously
are not here - and this is called the ``National Council  of  Provinces''  -
other people will begin to wonder: ``Is  this  thing  important?''  This  is
just an appeal. I am asking my colleagues, the premiers who are  still  here
and those who represent the others, to tell them. I think  it  is  important
that they give the necessary respect to this occasion.

Without taking too much of your time, Madam Chair, thank you very  much  for
the debate. I hope next time we will be able to say that we have  moved  on.
We have moved a little further than last time.  The  grandmothers  of  today
should not have the need to say to  their  children:  ``Le  indoda  sePetoli
efaka amaklesibhande.'' [The Government's  men  in  Pretoria  wear  braces.]
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Order!  We  thank  the  Deputy  President  for
having initiated this important debate. I think it is the  first  time  that
we have had such a review in this context of Parliament.

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 18:21.

                ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS

                        WEDNESDAY, 26 SEPTEMBER 2001

ANNOUNCEMENTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    The Speaker and the Chairperson:


     (1)    The Joint Tagging Mechanism (JTM) on 26 September 2001 in  terms
         of Joint Rule 160(3), classified the following Bill  as  a  section
         75 Bill:


         (i)     Basic Conditions of  Employment  Amendment  Bill  [B  70  -
              2001] (National Assembly - sec 75).


     (2)    The Joint Tagging Mechanism (JTM) on 26 September 2001 in  terms
         of Joint Rule 160(4), classified the following Bill  as  a  section
         76 Bill:


         (i)     Mental Health Care Bill [B 69 - 2001] (National Assembly  -
              sec 76).


     (3)    The Joint Tagging Mechanism (JTM) on 26 September 2001 in  terms
         of Joint Rule 161(1), classified the following Bill as follows:


         (i)     Immigration Bill [B 46 - 2001]


          The Bill was introduced as a section 75 Bill.  Clause  12  of  the
          Bill contains a money Bill provision within the meaning of section
          77(1) of the Constitution, while the rest of the Bill  deals  with
          matters  that  are  not  subordinate   and   incidental   to   the
          appropriation of money or  the  imposition  of  taxes,  levies  or
          duties. Therefore, the Bill cannot be classified as a  section  75
          Bill.


          Accordingly the JTM finds that the Bill is constitutionally out of
          order in terms of Joint Rule 161(1)(e).


     (4)     The  following  Bill  was  introduced  by  the   Minister   for
         Agriculture and  Land  Affairs  in  the  National  Assembly  on  26
         September 2001 and referred to the Joint  Tagging  Mechanism  (JTM)
         for classification in terms of Joint Rule 160:


         (i)     Planning Profession Bill [B 76 - 2001]  (National  Assembly
              - sec 75) [Explanatory summary of Bill and prior notice of its
              introduction published in Government Gazette No  22639  of  31
              August 2001.]


         The Bill has also been  referred  to  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
         Agriculture and Land Affairs of the National Assembly.


         In terms of Joint Rule 154 written views on the  classification  of
         the Bill may be submitted to  the  Joint  Tagging  Mechanism  (JTM)
         within three parliamentary working days.


     (5)     The  Minister  for  Justice  and   Constitutional   Development
         submitted  the  Wysigingswetsontwerp  op  die  Grondwet   van   die
         Republiek van Suid-Afrika [W 68 - 2001] (National  Assembly  -  sec
         74) to the Speaker and the Chairperson on 26 September  2001.  This
         is the official translation of the Constitution of the Republic  of
         South Africa Amendment Bill [B 68 - 2001] (National Assembly -  sec
         74), which was introduced in the National Assembly by the  Minister
