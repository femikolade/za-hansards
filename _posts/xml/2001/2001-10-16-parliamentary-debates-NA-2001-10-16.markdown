                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its concern at the announcement by Zimbabwean President
       Robert Mugabe that he is abandoning market-led economic policies in
       favour of a socialist-style command economy;


  (2) recognises that this move will -


       (a)  hasten the economic decline of the country leading to increased
           shortages and hunger; and
       (b)  have a destabilising effect on the region; and


  (3) therefore, calls on President Mbeki to -


       (a)  revise his policy of quiet diplomacy towards Zimbabwe in the
           interests of the economic well-being of the region; and


       (b)  make it clear that the behaviour of President Mugabe and his
           government will preclude Zimbabwe from being part of the New
           Africa Initiative until such time as the Mugabe government
           changes its current policies and practices.

[Applause.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock and sadness that an intruder on a farm at Kromdraai,
       near Krugersdorp, senselessly and brutally shot dead a mother and her
       daughter, and then critically wounded another daughter on Monday, 15
       October 2001;


  (2) conveys its condolences and sympathies to the family of the deceased
       and prays for the recovery of the wounded daughter;


  (3) further notes that a man allegedly in possession of two firearms that
       belonged to the family was arrested on Tuesday morning, 16 October
       2001, in connection with the murders; and


  (4) commends the police for the swift manner in which they tracked down
       and arrested the suspect.

[Applause.]

Mrs Z A KOTA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that President Thabo Mbeki visited the Eastern Cape last
       weekend;


  (2) further notes that the President used this visit to hold imbizo and
       to interact with ordinary people;


  (3) believes that consultation with ordinary people and the value that
       the ANC places on people-driven development is important for our
       country; and


  (4) commends the President for his successful visit to the Eastern Cape
       and his commitment to eradicate the poverty and violence which plague
       this province.

[Applause.]
Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the MRC report on HIV/Aids mortality indicates that the epidemic
           is undoubtedly the biggest cause of death in South Africa;


       (b)  the Government is misusing Statistics SA to discredit the MRC
           report in order to defend the President's unjustifiable position
           on this matter;


       (c)  it is inconceivable that the Government is using one state
           department to discredit another; and


       (d)  a visit to any hospital or mortuary will confirm that the MRC
           report is a true reflection of the severity of the disease; and


  (2) calls on the ANC Government to accept that HIV/Aids is the biggest
       killer of South Africans and to act accordingly, before more South
       Africans become part of our HIV/Aids statistics.

[Applause.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) salutes the many South Africans who live with HIV/Aids and the many
       who are committed to finding solutions, in the face of the
       Government's stupidity bordering on genocide;


  (2) expresses its disgust at the Government's delays and reluctance to
       release the Medical Research Council's report about HIV/Aids, coupled
       with blatant attempts at discrediting facts which do not fit with the
       President's confused agenda;


  (3) expresses its concern at yet another example that Government is out
       of touch with the realities in South Africa, as indicated by
       Gauteng's overcrowded mortuaries being allegedly forced to pack up to
       three corpses into a drawer made for one body;


  (4) calls on all South Africans to unite in their fight against the
       challenge of HIV/Aids despite the Government's self-inflicted
       incapacity; and


  (5) calls on the Government to acknowledge its incapacity in dealing with
       HIV/Aids and thus abandon its stubborn resistance and rather ...

[Time expired.]

Ms P K MOTHOAGAE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with deep concern the deliberate failure of the DP spokesperson
       on public accounts, the hon Taljaard, to honour an engagement with
       the students of the Eastern Cape Technikon;


  (2) further notes the consistent failure of the same member and the
       entire DP component to meet the Mozambican parliamentary delegation
       recently;


  (3) believes that these failures confirm that nonracism, nonsexism and
       gender equality are foreign to the DP and that these actions militate
       against the very essence of nation-building; and


  (4) urges the hon Tony Leon and his party to treat all delegations
       equally and to honour engagements with all sections of the South
       African population and not only those from Europe and privileged
       backgrounds.

[Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the MF:


  That the House -


  (1) acknowledges the Hindu nine-day celebration of Navaratri in honour of
       the goddesses Durgah, Lakshmi and Saraswati, representing strength,
       knowledge and wealth;


  (2) takes this opportunity to congratulate and wish well all those
       followers celebrating these festivities spent in dance, fast and joy
       throughout the world; and


  (3) wishes that this fast brings peace and harmony to our country.

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the FA:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the ANC Government has followed policies in South Africa
       which destroy jobs rather than create conditions conducive to
       increased employment;


  (2) further notes that over half a million jobs have been destroyed since
       the ANC came to power;


  (3) recognises that rigid labour legislation, low productivity,
       deteriorating infrastructure, ill-considered taxes, under-funded law
       enforcement, corruption, mismanagement and a foreign policy based on
       sentiment rather than good sense are all working against job creation
       in the future; and


  (4) therefore calls on the ANC to step into the 21st century and look at
       successful programmes in the world, and learn how to encourage job
       creation in South Africa.

[Applause.]

Dr R H DAVIES: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes reports that a United States bomb fell near a crowded
       marketplace and killed civilians in Jalalabad;


  (2) further notes reports that predict that 100 000 Afghan children could
       die this winter unless food reaches them in six weeks;


  (3) believes that innocent and unarmed civilians, especially children and
       women, must be protected from injury, pain and suffering; and


  (4) reiterates our view that whilst perpetrators of acts of terror are
       given no quarter, everything must be done to ensure that civilians,
       children and women are not caught in the crossfire.

[Applause.]

           environment''; and


       (c)  the state could find itself as a potentially unsuccessful

           year;


  (2) calls on the Minister of Transport to explain why his department has
       neglected road maintenance and allowed road safety to deteriorate to
       such an extent; and

       regressive economic policies entailing the nationalisation of private
       property and the disruption of the economy;


  (3) concedes that -


       (a)  Robert Mugabe is blatantly holding South Africa and the region
           hostage;


       (b)  he is making a mockery of President Mbeki's Millennium African
           Recovery Plan and its principle of the rule of law, responsible
           economic policies and democracy; and


       (c)  his active promotion of political and economical policies that
           lead to the destabilisation of the region brings into question
           the credibility of the diplomatic approach we have adopted
           towards that country ...

                     PENSION FUNDS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker and hon members, it is a pleasure to
table the Second Reading of the Bill, which deals essentially with the
apportionment of surpluses built up in pension funds.

This Bill, some members will recall, served before the committee about two
years ago. It was recalled for further discussion and, after it served in
the committee, it was followed by exhaustive and exhausting discussions in
the context of Nedlac. Within Nedlac we failed to reach an absolute
consensus, but the process in Nedlac allowed for extensive learning -
certainly by Government - of the views of stakeholders. Drawing on these
experiences we have now produced a Bill that provides for both balance and
equity.

In the context of the hearings in the Portfolio Committee on Finance, there
were lengthy presentations by a number of organisations who have a keen
interest in the outcome of this legislations, and I think it is appropriate
that we express our appreciation to those organisations. Indeed, they were
able to contribute to fairly significant refinement of the Bill and to the
development of a series of regulations.

The Bill is essentially about redressing past injustices. It provides for
the equitable and sustainable apportionment of actuarially determined
surpluses in pension funds. But the Bill also introduces new obligations
for the provision of minimum benefits in private pension funds.

It is quite important that we just pause for a moment and consider what
these actuarial surpluses are. Essentially, they are about constructing a
careful balance between the assets and liabilities and ensuring that the
assets in funds can cover the liabilities. However, the Bill also allows
boards of funds to establish contingency reserves to deal with instances
like capital gains tax and incidents of HIV/Aids within the fund.
The Bill also allows for the creation of investment reserves to cushion
against the vagaries of stock markets. The co-principles are those of the
involvement of stakeholders, permits on equity, on limitation of risk
sharing for employers and employees together, on the protection of savings
performance, on the separation of the past and future, and of maintaining
or developing stability in the sector. In constructing the balance, it
calls for us to develop an approach that recognises that no group could
claim exclusive rights to the surpluses, except, perhaps, to recognise that
former members and pensioners of funds, who were members or pensioners
since 1 January 1980 had a first claim on actuarial surpluses.

It was also established that on 31 December last year, there was an
estimated R80 billion of surpluses build up in private pension funds. The
surpluses were sometimes built up because of better than expected investor
performance, but more often than not they were the result of inadequate
information and education. And I think that what we were able to establish
in the course of the engagement on this Bill, was that members have a
reasonable expectation of an improvement in their benefits if surpluses
exist. What clearly will be ongoing will be the convening of technical
committees within each fund of the representatives of employers, employees
and pensioners together to revalue and determine the assumptions and to
ensure that the underlying minimum benefits are in line with what the
pension fund can afford.

In addition, the process now brings into being a series of regulations in
the draft Bill. Firstly, that the board of the fund shall appoint a person
or persons to represent the interests of former members. Secondly, as I
said earlier, that former members are viewed as all those who were members
in the period between 1 January 1980 and the present. Thirdly, the employer
becomes responsible for any part of the surplus which he or she or they
improperly use. Fourthly, that there be a top up to ensure that former
members and pensioners have a first charge against the surplus. Fifthly,
that the remainder be equitably distributed in the interest of all
stakeholders.
The Bill does not require funds that do not have a surplus now to create a
deficit by topping up. The Bill does create a special tribunal and allows
pension funds to draw from panels for this. There is a very clear
commitment in the Bill and in the entire approach to ensure that employers
do not save and cash from surpluses, because we believe that this will
create huge macroeconomic risks. The Bill also creates an obligation on
employers to fund future deficits. I trust that this Bill will be supported
by all parties in the House, but in doing that, I think we must recognise
that having the legislation is only part of the battle. What lies ahead is
the enormous amount of education that will be necessary of all members of
pension funds, but especially higher intensity training of trustees and,
secondly, that there needs to be the exercising of caution in respect of
investment decisions.

This legislation brings to an end a saga that we all lived through in
respect of this Bill, a saga that was marked certainly by a lot of passion
and greed, a saga that went to the heart of the power relations between
employers and employees, and between wronged people who have future
expectations. But it is a saga that has spanned the period, certainly,
since the early 1980s.

I would like to express sincere appreciation to Deputy Minister Mpahlwa,
who is in Danhug at the moment, for having piloted this through and sat
through those very exhausting negotiations, to the team in the National
Treasury and, in particular, Elias Masilela and Chris Malan, to the
Financial Services Board and the Chief Actuary, Jeremy Andrew in
particular, to the various organisations that made  presentations at the
Portfolio Committee on Finance, to Nedlac and its Executive Director
Phillip Dexter for their involvement in trying to reach consensus and, last
but not least, to all members of the Portfolio Committee on Finance and the
chairperson, Barbara Hogan, in particular.

In tabling the Pension Funds Second Amendment Bill for its Second Reading
debate, I invite all parties in this House to support the Bill. [Applause.]

Chairperson, I apologise; I should call you ``Deputy Chairperson''.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Yes, we do these things behind
your back, Minister.

The MINISTER: Chairperson, I shall ask that you kindly install rear-view
mirrors here.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes.

Ms B A HOGAN: Chairperson, this is an important Bill, because, as the
Minister said, it will redress past injustices that were done. Briefly, a
surplus that was calculated at about R80 billion arose in pension funds
over a long period of time. How is it that a surplus of that magnitude can
arise that easily? Well, part of the reason is that those people who left
funds did not receive the full amount which they should have received.
Those pensioners who were receiving pensions from that fund, were possibly
not receiving the amount that they should have been receiving.

Those employers, particularly when one talks about defined benefit funds,
who were contributing to that fund, were contributing more than they should
have, because they were basing their contributions on conservative
actuarial figures. And finally, of course, investment returns were greater
than was anticipated. So over a period of time, a surplus which is now a
significant one, started to develop in these funds.

The question then arose as to who should be entitled to that surplus.  And
that is where the deadlock happened in Nedlac. Businesses, believing
themselves to be the main contributors and the main carriers of risk,
particularly as regards defined benefit funds, believe that they should
have a right to those funds, because they were, in fact, contributing in
excess of what they should have.

However, in a famous court judgment it was ruled that the pension funds
belong to the fund and it is the board that should make a decision on what
should be done with those funds. Likewise, the court noted that there was
no legislation ruling on what should be done with surpluses in those funds
and, therefore, suggested that Parliament should enact such legislation.
And that is what we are doing here.

The approach taken by this legislation is to say that all stakeholders
should have access to that surplus. In other words, current members of the
fund, who include current pensioners, contributors, former members or
people who left those funds, and employers - and that is very important -
should have access to that surplus.

However, former members and pensioners, particularly former members who
left those funds - remember that in the 1980s there was a concerted drive
by the trade union movement to ensure that members transferred out of the
defined benefit to defined contribution funds for a number of reasons,
which I will not go into now - should have prior access to that surplus and
actuaries in the fund will determine what surplus should be their due. They
should then have that prior access.

After that, the surplus funds remaining in that fund would then be divided
between members and employers and placed in the respective surplus accounts
of each. The Bill goes further and makes provision for a minimum benefit
that a person should enjoy when they leave the fund or when that fund
terminates, when it is liquidated or when it converts from a defined
benefit to a defined contribution. And it also ensures - remember these are
only minimum benefits - that injustices in the past, where people were
allowed to leave pension funds without taking the full amount that they
should have taken, are now redressed.

In this way, it is envisaged that surpluses will no longer be able to
develop in the funds as they did in the past. Likewise with pensioners,
there is a prescription on what should be a minimum pension increase. That
minimum pension increase will be inflation-linked but it will not be
indexed because, as we all know, inflation is a tiger that is often very
difficult to control.

Once the surplus is distributed to the members and employers, it can only
be used under certain conditions. It is not a freehold and employers cannot
use it as they like. One of the important conditions for employers is that
they can use it for a contribution holiday. They can also, importantly, use
it if a retrenchment is required. This can facilitate the use of employer's
surplus funds and the prevention of job losses.

Every pension fund is now going to have to identify its former members
through advertisements, through checking, through records and through
consultation with unions. A person has to be appointed by that fund to
specifically represent the interests of those former members. Each fund
will then have to work out a plan of how it is going to apportion that
surplus. Once that plan is drawn up, it must be submitted to the Registrar
of Pension Funds, who can then approve it. The registrar must also receive
a report of all the complaints that have been lodged. If the registrar is
of the opinion that a proper apportionment process has not taken place or
that the pension fund itself cannot apportion the surplus - as there is a
deadlock in the fund - the registrar can refer it to a special tribunal,
which will then take a final decision.

Therefore, there are various protections built into this process of surplus
apportionment. The other protection is that at least 75% of the members of
the board of the fund must approve the scheme. But there is a certain
period in which members cannot complain. Importantly, it will not be the
pension fund adjudicator who will be determining the complaints but a
special tribunal.

I would like to thank Christopher Malan, Mr Elias Masilela, Jeremy Andrew,
and in particular the trade union movement, who paid scrupulous attention
to this Bill and interacted with our committee in many ways, for the hard
work they put into this legislation.

What has been disappointing is that business interacted and engaged with
the committee in a far less sustained way. One hopes that the needs of
business have been met, as we often had to conjecture what the needs would
be. But, as the Minister has said, the next two to three years are going to
be crucial years in which the success of this venture will be tested. The
actuarial profession is going to be placed under enormous strain to meet
the requirements of this fund, and we request all former members and
pensioners to please contact their funds to ensure that they can benefit
from what this legislation is trying to achieve. [Applause.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Mr Chairperson, this Bill deals with the distribution of
surpluses in pension funds and future minimum benefits for members. It is
an extremely complex Bill and has been very controversial. Nedlac debated
it for years and no agreement could be reached between Government, business
and labour.

It has been subjected to thorough examination and substantial amendment by
the Portfolio Committee on Finance. During this process, the committee was
given considerable assistance by various officials from the National
Treasury and the Financial Services Board, particularly Mr Jeremy Andrew,
to whom a special word of thanks is due.

Over the years pension funds, particularly many defined benefit pension
funds, have accumulated large surpluses totalling an estimated R80 to R200
billion. The Bill is designed to determine who is entitled to that money.
Business claims that the employer is responsible for deficits in a fund and
is therefore entitled to any surpluses. Labour points out that a pension
fund is an independent juristic person, and not simply an extension of the
employer, and therefore claims that all the money, including surpluses,
belongs to members and former members.

Those pension funds which have surpluses differ as to the causes giving
rise to the surplus. Major causes include poor benefits paid to employees
who resigned or were retrenched; low cost-of-living increases granted to
people already on pension; investment returns above the expected levels;
and unreasonably low transfer of funds when members and employees
transferred from defined benefit pension funds to defined contribution
pension funds - something which happened on a large scale during the 1980s
and the early part of the 1990s. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon Mndende!

Mr K M ANDREW: In his evidence to the portfolio committee, Prof John
Murphy, the Pension Fund Adjudicator, summarised the situation very well,
and I quote:


  The legislative scheme in general seems to embody an attempt at a
  legitimate compromise, reflected, I suspect, in the fact that no single
  interest group will be entirely satisfied with the result.

And further:


  In the period leading up to the democratisation of our country, employers
  and trade unions, in pursuit of their own interests and with an eye on
  international trends, set about extensively restructuring pension fund
  rights and liabilities from a defined benefit to a defined contribution
  basis of funding and entitlement. The schemes and arrangements which
  followed, designed by actuaries and consultants acting on behalf of
  employers, more often than not calculated transfer values on the low
  side, resulting in substantial surplus assets being left behind in the
  defined benefit funds for use by a handful old order members and the
  employer, with the ultimate aim in many instances of repatriating the
  bulk of the surplus to the employer.


  Had the actuarial methodology and assumptions applied in the original
  calculations produced more equitable transfer values, the present
  legislation would not have been necessary.

The Bill steers a middle course, attempts to remedy the injustices of the
recent past in a rational way, and ensures a fair deal for all members of
pension funds in the future. The Democratic Alliance will therefore be
supporting the Bill. There are, however, some issues that deserve further
comment. [Interjections.] I know the Minister only likes compliments, but
of course the world is not perfect. Neither is he nor his Ministry.

Firstly, as the Pension Fund Adjudicator highlighted, the Bill is an
acknowledgement that the regulatory function has failed us. There has been
a failure of regulation, which the Bill seeks to remedy. Can the Minister
assure us that the necessary regulatory mechanisms and capacity are now in
place to monitor the implementation of pension funds legislation - this
Bill and others?

Secondly, it was disappointing and worrying that the Financial Services
Board was unable to provide the committee with reliable statistics relating
to the size of various fund categories, transfers etc, apparently because
information was lost during a change in computer systems.

Finally, and most importantly, I would like the Minister to tell Parliament
when similar legislation dealing with withdrawal and future benefits of
Public Service pension funds is to be tabled. We should be practising what
we preach to the private sector.

The Democratic Alliance will be supporting the Bill.

Mr H J BEKKER: Mr Chairperson, this Bill has four main objectives: Firstly,
minimum values that have to be paid from retirement funds in future are
introduced; secondly, the Bill will prevent the creation of future pension
fund surpluses by introducing minimum increases and interest for early
leavers of the fund; thirdly, the Bill deals with the equitable
distribution of the existing surpluses in pension funds between members,
former members and the employer; and fourthly, the Bill determines how the
surplus may be used in future.

The existing pension funds surplus had been estimated at more than R80
billion in 1999. Clearly, whatever the reasons for the accumulation,
employers and employees are entitled to an equitable share of the surplus.
The Bill creates a formula for achieving this purpose which can be said to
be fair and reasonable.

Importantly, the Bill entrenches the principle of protection for pension
funds in dealing with a fall in the value of their assets and other
contingencies. This is vital for the long-term survival of the retirement
industry in South Africa.

The Bill, however, also caters for past members who left funds,
transferred, converted or were retrenched. In this way, members of the
portfolio committee were of the opinion that the distribution of the
surplus would attain greater legitimacy and equity for a greater number of
people. The problem that may arise by going back too far in the past, is
that the pension funds may no longer have these records in place and as
such may open themselves up to litigation.

Let us in this case envisage a scenario where a company in trouble has been
taken over and completely restructured. In practice, cases do exist where
such companies have retrenched more than 50% of their workforce. The
question arises now whether such retrenchments and utilisation of surpluses
could theoretically be deemed improper or illegal, despite the fact that at
the time of implementation they were allowed in terms of the Pension Funds
Act of 1956 and all other applicable legislation; were approved by the
board of trustees of each fund; involved rule amendments which were
approved by the Financial Services Board and the SA Revenue Services; and
lastly, may have required section 14 transfer certificates which were
approved by the Financial Services Board.

In theory, the improper use of a surplus at that time can now be offset
against any surplus which will now be allocated to the employer. Several
employers are of the opinion that this will be of little value since the
provisions of the Bill will, according to them, only allocate a small
portion of the surplus to this category and once this surplus has been
absorbed the company itself may be litigated against in its personal
capacity. I believe that it is important for the Minister to clarify these
perceptions and thereby set employers' minds at rest.

The repayment of pensions to previous employees should be restricted only
to the allocated surplus for this category, and protection against further
claims against the fund or employer should be guaranteed. In this regard
the IFP, of course, only considers employers who have indeed acted
according to the rules and, in terms of the previous dispensation, strictly
according to what they should have done.

Hopefully, the distribution of the surplus will lead to higher levels of
domestic investment and savings, but additional consumer spending could be
expected at the very least. This should provide some impetus and momentum
to the economy. We fully realise that this legislation put forward a
compromise, and therefore both employers and employees will not be 100%
satisfied. Furthermore, we believe that this legislation, under the
circumstances, is the best possible which there would be.
With these cautionary remarks, and a request for improved communication
with role-players, the IFP will support the legislation. [Applause.]

Prof B TUROK: Mr Chairperson, as I was coming into the ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Are you rising on a point of
order regarding the fraternal greetings? [Laughter.]

Prof B TUROK: I hope the timing has not started yet, because I have a lot
to say. And Ken Andrew will be educated in the process.

As I came into the hall today, somebody said to me: ``As you are dealing
with pensions, I have a small suggestion - a small amendment to this Bill
to allow for a pension for the hon Tony Leon and the hon Van Schalkwyk
would get rid of a major problem that we have at the moment. This would be
conflict resolution by Parliament.'' So, although I cannot formerly move
it, I do want to suggest that the Minister may find a way of doing
something about that.

Listening to the debate this afternoon, one is absolutely surprised at the
tame legislation - as it appears - that we are bringing before the House.
Whereas, in fact, in the committee there was enormous heat, so many
meetings, so many documents placed before us and so much controversy, one
is a little bit surprised as to why in the House itself today we seem to be
dealing with something rather insignificant, whereas in fact the Bill
represented a major battle. And I ask myself, why? It seems that the answer
lies in the question of history. I think that this Bill reveals something
about the history of South Africa which people are perhaps missing in this
debate.

The ANC is often charged with complaining too much about history, but I
think that this Bill reveals that that complaint is often - and
particularly in this case - fully justified.

Clause 15(b)(3) of the Bill states that any pension fund must take into
account the financial history before distributing a surplus. Why is it that
the Bill should specify that history is so important when it comes to
apportioning a surplus which may be there? The answer is that it reveals
past inequities and requires a certain historical imagination on our part
to understand what that history is. It is hidden somehow in the clauses of
the Bill itself, and I am going to try, very briefly, to bring it out.

I should bring it out by making a comparison between people who brought
evidence to the committee, namely the Financial Services Board on behalf of
Government, business and labour, and this led to a distillation of opinion
in the committee which somehow was able to rise above those contending
views and really dig into the history and find out what history will tell
us about this particular controversy.

The Financial Services Board raised the question: How did this R80 billion
arise? By the way, let me say that I am absolutely flummoxed that an amount
of R80 billion, which is apparently lying around somewhere, is regarded
with a certain casualness in this Bill. Eighty billion rand is a vast
amount of money, and that is why there was heat from labour and business
who all wanted a share of the pie. I think Parliament must understand that
there was a battle around this issue.

The committee was told that the funds in the past - going into history -
were run by employers. Senior employers were executives on the boards;
trustees were appointed by the employer and, we were told, labour people
were sometimes bribed by employers on the executive of these funds. There
was little differentiation between the board and the employer; the fund and
the employer, and there was insufficient disclosure to members.

A vital element of the fund, as people have pointed out, was the transfer
from defined benefits to defined contributions, which meant that executives
were raiding the funds. Surpluses were used improperly, there were higher
benefits for executives than for ordinary members, and so on, showing that
in the history of South African pension funds administration, there is a
gross inequality in the way that things were handled.

Business South Africa then came to us and said that the employer owns the
surplus. They also said that payments in the past were made in line with
approved practice under a system in which workers and employers were part
of a highly inequitable system in which employers manipulated the fund.
They also said that payments were paid in line with the practices of the
time. I am saying that history tells us that the approved practices of the
time were totally inequitable and unjust, and that is why our committee had
to battle with this issue of how we could correct that history.

We were told that the surplus was due to actuarial conservatism. This is a
nice euphemism for what was going on in some of these funds - and I am not
saying in all of them, but in some of them. Certainly, the evidence that
was brought to us was that there was manipulation of a high order in
certain funds and it is the job of Parliament and the finance committee in
so many months to try and get to the root of this historical injustice.

What surprised us a little was that the actuarial society, through the
president no less, in a document to us, said that it is not practical to
impose a new basis for past transactions. Surpluses should only go to
current employees. They said - and I am talking about history now - that
past actions were in good faith and in line with accepted practices, and
that the proposals in the Bill are unfair. I would appeal to the House to
give cognisance of the fact that these actuaries who were supposed to be
objective and neutral were in fact taking the side of the employer in
saying that past practices were reasonable and fair and that the proposals
in the Bill were unfair.

Labour on the other hand said that in the 1990s there was no regulation in
the industry, there were no worker representatives in the defined benefit
funds, workers were not informed; unions went on strike, there was no
information, the employers encouraged movement from defined benefits to
defined contributions and so on. Furthermore, investment reserves had been
stripped and they said that the funds are for beneficiaries and not for
employers.

The committee then had to display the wisdom of Solomon and see where it
should go. Our conclusion was that it was broadly understood that the role
of Parliament is to stand for the public interest. We stand neither for the
employers nor the employees. We simply stand for the public interest, which
meant equity for all, taking account of our history.

We took the decisions that have been outlined to this House by the Minister
and the hon Hogan, namely that the money belongs to the fund and that
distribution must be done on the basis of equity; that history is
important; and that any legislation which comes before the House must be
seen in a historic context. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, you still have
eight seconds to go but you are finished. [Laughter.]

Dr P J RABIE: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members ...
[Interjections.] No, I did everything myself!

The Pension Funds Second Amendment Bill deals in particular with the
distribution of surplus funds in pension funds, and future minimum benefits
for members. This is a very complex and technical Bill and can be
categorised as a fair piece of legislation because it allows the respective
stakeholders to participate with regards to the distribution of surplus
funds.

Two basic concepts are extremely important if this particular piece of
legislation is evaluated, namely the distinction which is made between
defined benefit funds on the hand and contribution pension funds on the
other. A very simple example of a defined benefit fund is where a member is
guaranteed a certain benefit at retirememt. A set formula that relates to
years of service and the final salary are two key variables in determining
the final pension benefit. A defined contribution pension fund has to a
large extent been replaced by a direct benefit pension fund and it
basically means that the employer and the employee contribute an agreed
proportions of the employees salary, and the pension available at
retirement depends on the months contributed plus investment growth.

The Bill also clarifies who is entitled to the available surplus money. Two
conflicting views emerged at the public hearings, namely that labour was of
the opinion that the pension fund is an independent legal entity and not an
extension of the employer, therefore all the money, including surpluses,
belongs to the members and former members of the pension fund. However,
business stressed the point that the employer is responsible for a deficit
and contributes a substantial amount of money, and is therefore entitled to
the financial surplus. That is one of the positive factors about this Bill
in that both these two components are actively involved and are taken care
of.

It is estimated that the surplus funds vary from anything between R80
million and R200 million. At present there is a fair degree of controversy
regarding how pension funds were administered in the past. Some of them
ended up in the Appeal Court in Bloemfontein recently regarding this
particular factor. Basically, pension funds which have surpluses furnished
a number of reasons as to what gave rise to their surpluses, and some
reasons are alarming.

Firstly, poor benefits were paid to employees who resigned or were
retrenched. Secondly, the low cost-of-living increases granted to
pensioners who were already struggling to make ends meet on their present
pensions was another reason that was given. What is of particular concern
is that it was mentioned at the public hearings that a number of pension
funds deliberately transferred unreasonably low amounts from direct benefit
pension funds to direct contribution funds, something which appears to have
occurred fairly regularly in the 1980s and the early 1990s. This is clearly
not acceptable, and this piece of legislation will fill the shortcomings in
the present legislation. [Interjections.]

Later, wanneer ek my toespraak voltooi het, sal ek die agb lid hieroor
antwoord. [Later, when I have finished my speech, I will answer the hon
member about this.]

I will come to that member later as well, because I did not hear anything.
This Bill can be defined as an honest attempt to act as a compromise
between all respective interest groups.

In the 1980s and 1990s employers and trade unions encouraged their members
to extensively restructure their assets and liabilities from a defined
benefit fund to a defined contribution fund on the basis designed by
actuaries and consultants acting on behalf of employers, who often
calculated transfer arrangements in an inequitable manner and also failed
to give reasonable benefits and rights to members.

It is my belief that this piece of legislation will address some of the
injustices of the past and will result in a more equitable distribution of
assets to members of pension funds. The DA supports this piece of
legislation.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Chairperson and hon members, the Bill before us has a long
history of negotiations. The first draft Bill was withdrawn in 1998, based
on objections voiced by organised labour. In subsequent discussions no
consensus or solutions could be reached between labour and business in
Nedlac. This Bill is therefore a compromise attempt by Government.
Ironically, neither business nor labour is fully satisfied with the product
as it stands.

This situation is a litigator's dream and a portion of the value of the
surplus to be apportioned will without doubt be spent on lawyers' fees in
the future. It is disturbing and cause for concern that the full economic
and fiscal impacts of such an important Bill on our economy have not been
researched and established.

It is indeed possible that this Bill may have severe and potentially
detrimental implications for the South African economy. As a matter of
fact, the National Treasury has referred to the following risks involved in
this process in their presentation to the Portfolio Committee on Finance:
firstly, a possible negative market impact and, secondly, an extended
negative effect on equity.

Many unanswered questions remain around the implementation of this Bill.
What strain will be put on the retirement industry? What effect will this
Bill have on some listed shares on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange?
What effect will penal retrospective legislation have on investor
confidence? How will companies which are not in a position to repay money
and are suddenly burdened with a huge debt, react in terms of a possible
liquidation, downsizing, possible job loses and reduced profitability? Will
employees be effectively traced and fully compensated for what is due to
them in terms of this Bill?

We fully support the principle that provision should be made for the
apportionment of actuarial surpluses and to address the historical improper
use of surpluses by some employers, to the detriment of pension fund
members. The uncertainty surrounding the possible negative effects of this
Bill in its current form on the economy and on the financial market poses a
serious problem. It is important that the economic and financial impact of
this Bill is determined and quantified in the interest of both employees
and employers.

The UDM has hereby noted its concerns in respect of the Bill and expresses
the hope that all role-players will act in such a way that the
apportionment of the surpluses will be done in a manner that will not
negatively affect our economy and financial markets. I trust that this will
be the objective of both employers and employee when the apportionment of
the surpluses is being negotiated.
Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, hon Minister and members, this Bill paves the
way for equitable benefits where historically pension payouts lacked
legislative security in this regard. Whatever surplus is accrued by the
fund, negotiated arrangements will determine the minimum levels of
contributions that will be allowed for. This form of equitable or fair
value calculation automatically raises the standards and norms of the
pension fund industry. The challenge this Bill offers to pension funds is
clause 15(b)4, which deals with redressing past unfair calculations of the
pension surplus. A legal imperative will be placed upon the pension fund
industry to re-examine and redress its historical payout schemes.

Inasmuch as this clause is laudable and an acceptable provision, we must
ensure that reasonable certainty exists that historical redress is
feasible. Actuarial research into historical data will be costly and will
probably be a lengthy process. The retrieval of historical data as well as
the economic assessment of such data may not yield the desired outcomes
this Bill hopes to achieve. What is preferably needed is to introduce a
formula upon which equitable surplus averages can be calculated against a
historically acceptable rate.

We support the view that all past and present members of a pension fund
should benefit from any surpluses created by the fund. The Government and
the pension fund industry can define a formula upon which such averages can
be calculated in order to avoid the possible problems clause 15(b)4 may
cause.

The ACDP supports this Bill, because we believe it is a sincere attempt to
address the injustices of the past. It also attempts to equitably
distribute the surplus to both employees and employers.

Mr M N NENE: Chairperson and hon members, the pension surplus we are
discussing today accrued some time in the past, during the apartheid era.
This is how insensitive this system was to the vulnerable. The majority of
the victims were undoubtedly the poor and mostly black. As we have heard
from previous speakers on how this surplus accrued, it is clear that as
Parliament we had to put in place a system through which this injustice
could be addressed.

This Bill, amongst others, makes new provisions for the apportionment of
actuarial surpluses and the minimum benefits to be set. The people shall
share in the country's wealth. This is what the ANC's Freedom Charter
states and this is what we envisaged in 1955 when the people's charter was
drawn up. While the minimum benefits are set to ensure that what happened
in the past is not repeated, the apportionment of the surpluses ensures
that they are distributed equitably among stakeholders. Why do we say
stakeholders? It is because the ANC Government, as much as it was concerned
with members' plight, could not address these concerns to the detriment of
business. This then gave birth to the stakeholder concept. It means former
members and the employer.

As a committee, we were faced with a very complex and difficult situation
of extremely divergent views between labour and business. These are both
major players in our economy. The apportionment of the existing surplus
will take place under very stringent conditions. The board will submit to
the registrar a scheme for the proposed apportionment of the surplus after
all the stipulated conditions have been satisfied. Since the entire
actuarial surplus belongs to the fund as ruled in the Tek court case, no
party has a right to repatriate the surplus. Two very important reserve
accounts are established to facilitate the apportionment process. The first
is the employer surplus account and the second the member surplus account.

Section 15B provides for a process to ensure that the trustees and members
give their informed consent in apportioning the surplus. At least 75% of
the board must approve the distribution, and the board is made up of a
50/50 representation between employees and employers. Members must have
adequate information on time - which is approximately four weeks - to
consider the distribution and it must be endorsed by an actuary that it is
equitable. The registrar has the right to require an independent actuary to
review the distribution. Lastly, the registrar must be satisfied that the
process has been followed correctly and that distribution is reasonable and
equitable.

I do not want to bore this House with details but perhaps it would be
appropriate to outline how the stakeholders will be allowed to use the
surplus. The use is for members and former members and will be as follows.
This surplus can only be used for the improvement of current benefits and
those previously paid to former members. It can also be used to reduce
current contributions, which is equivalent to a contribution holiday. It
can also be used to meet expenses which would otherwise reduce the
proportion of the members' contributions that are invested for retirement.

On the employer's side it can only be used for the improvement of benefits,
for meeting the expenses which the employer is obliged to pay in terms of
the fund and also to avoid imminent job loses and the transfer of the
surplus from one fund to another. It can also be used for funding
contribution holidays.

Other issues are the minimum benefit, which has already been covered by our
hon chairperson. These are the minimum pension increase, individual
account, contribution accumulation and individual reserve. The pension
increases, to mention but a few, are specified to be at a lower rate than
the fund can afford to give on the basis of its investment returns earned,
less the cost of pension increases granted and the change of CPI from the
date of retirement. This will ensure reasonable pension increases for
pensioners.

The introduction of the concept of minimum benefits to be paid in the
future is aimed at removing possible abuses perceived in the past in
connection with the transfers and convergent values. Convergent values,
retrenchment benefits, pension increases and interest rates are payable on
a refund of contributions. The people shall share in the country's wealth.
These noble words, enshrined in the Freedom Charter 46 years ago, are still
true today and will continue to be true. The ANC supports the Bill.

Dr C P MULDER: Voorsitter, ek dink die agb lid Nene vat die saak 'n klein
bietjie ver om met hierdie kwessie by die Vryheidsmanifes te gaan draai.
Dit is nie regtig noodsaaklik nie. Die toets is doodeenvoudig: As daar
politiek agter hierdie ding was, sou daar sekerlik vandag 'n surplus gewees
het en het die mense wat met die geld te doene gehad het, dit waarskynlik
onder hulle pelle versprei. Feit van die saak is: Daar is min dinge so
tragies en hartseer as om iemand op sy oudag te sien wat nie behoorlik vir
sy aftrede voorsiening gemaak het nie. So 'n persoon word gestroop van sy
waardigheid en word dikwels gedwing om terug te val op die hulp en
ondersteuning van familie, vriende en kinders of op die staat vir
versorging.

Maar dis eenvoudig nie moontlik vir die staat om deur middel van
staatspensioene die al groterwordende behoefte vir die versorging van
afgetredenes te sorg nie. Juis daarom is dit so belangrik dat daar privaat
pensioenfondse bestaan en dat mense aangemoedig word om selfs tydens hul
aktiewe werkloopbaan vir hulself te beplan en daarby aan te sluit en
voorsiening te maak. Sodoende kan mense vir hulself baie hartseer op hul
oudag spaar.

Die VF sal alle wetgewende maatreÃ«ls wat die saak van private
pensioenfondse verbeter, steun. Ons dink dit is absoluut noodsaaklik. Die
VF verwelkom daarom veral die bepalings in artikels 14A en 14B van die
wysigingswetsontwerp, om voorsiening te maak vir 'n minimum voordeel vir
lede van pensioenfondse. Hoe beter die voordele vir 'n lid is, hoe meer sal
ons dit ondersteun. Die probleem egter is dat dit inflasie is wat maak dat
mense wat vandag aftree, nie hulle pensioen kan gebruik nie. Binne 'n kort
tydjie vind hulle dat die pensioen net nie meer voldoende is nie. Daar word
nie verniet gesÃª: (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Chairperson, I think the hon member Nene is taking the
issue a bit far by referring to the Freedom Charter on this issue. That is
not really essential. The test is very simple: If politics was behind this
thing, today there would certainly have been a surplus and the people who
dealt with the money would probably have distributed it among their
friends. The fact of the matter is: There are few things as tragic and sad
as seeing someone in their old age who has not made adequate provision for
their retirement. Such a person is stripped of their dignity and is often
forced to fall back on the assistance and support of family, friends and
children, or on the state for care.

However, it simply is not possible for the state, by way of government
pensions, to meet the ever-increasing need for the care of those who have
retired. Precisely for that reason it is so important that private pension
funds exist and that people are encouraged to plan for themselves during
their active careers and to join such pension funds and make provision. In
this way people can save themselves a great deal of unhappiness in their
old age. The FF will support all legislative measures which improve the
cause of private pension funds. We think they are absolutely essential. For
this reason the FF particularly welcomes the provisions in clause sections
14A and 14B of the amending Bill, to make provision for a minimum benefit
for members of pension funds. The better the benefit for a member, the more
we will support it. However, the problem is that it is inflation which
causes people who retire today to be unable to use their pension. Very soon
they find that the pension is no longer sufficient. Not for nothing is the
following said:]

Inflation is like this: two years ago if one retired, one was given a gold
watch. Last year if one retired, one was given a silver watch. Now if one
retires, one is given fifty cents and a number to dial for the time.

Feit van die saak is, die VF sal graag die wetsontwerp ondersteun. Ons glo
dat in terme van hoe die wet voorstel dat die surplusse hanteer word, dit
in almal se belang sal wees wat hierby betrokke is. Ons is bly dat daar 'n
kompromie gevind kan word en ondersteun graag die wetsontwerp. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The fact of the matter is, the FF will gladly support the Bill. With
regard to how the Act proposes that surpluses be dealt with, we believe it
will be in the interests of everyone involved. We are glad that a
compromise could be found and gladly support the Bill.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson, hon members, when people invest their labour,
time and energy in any job, they look forward to a reward when times of
need come.

Pensions are put in place to allow those fortunate ones with jobs to
feather their nests in preparation for a rainy day such as disability or
old age. This Bill seeks to do just that. The Bill introduces new concepts
such as ``deferred pensioner'' which is defined as ``a member who has not
yet retired but has left the service of the employer concerned, prior to
normal retirement date leaving in the fund the members rights to such
benefits as may be defined in the rules''.

The introduction of such beneficiaries makes sure that employees will no
longer forfeit their benefits because they did not serve up to retirement
age. The introduction of a clause that makes it imperative for any pension
fund board to establish and implement a policy with regard to increases to
be granted to pensioners and deferred pensioners is most welcome. The Bill
takes into account that increases have to be made to offset price inflation
and consumer price indexes. Sections 15A to 15K are being inserted into the
existing Act, among other things, to ensure that members of the fund are
not disadvantaged, and to put it beyond doubt that any credit balance in
the members' surplus account is used for the benefit of members. Former
members of funds will also be represented by appointed persons, so that
their voices can be heard on an ongoing basis. The proposals and intentions
of the board of the fund will be made known to such former members through
such appointees.
The new insertions, particularly section 15D, spell out clearly that,
should the board decide to utilise surplus funds, it should only be,
amongst others, to improve the benefits paid to the members and former
members, so that members' and former members' quality of life can improve;
and to reduce the current contributions due from members so that they may
have spending money.

The Bill seeks ways and means in which people who have invested their
labour in some companies or institutions do not end up worse off. The UCDP
supports the Bill.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, the PAC rises to support the Pension Funds
Second Amendment Bill. Its purpose is to amend the Pension Funds Act of
1956. This Act is 45 years old.

This Bill is aimed at making provision for the apportionment of actuarial
surpluses for minimum benefits, and to provide for matters connected
therewith. Clause 1 defines ``actuarial surplus'' in relation to a fund
which is subject to actuarial evaluation, ``as the difference between the
value that the valuator has placed on the assets of the fund less any audit
balances in the surplus accounts and the value that the valuator has placed
on the liabilities of the fund . together with the value of those
contingency reserve accounts which are established or which the board deems
prudent to establish on the advice of the valuator''.

A ``deferred pensioner'' is defined as ``a member who has not yet retired
but has left the service of the employer concerned prior to normal
retirement date ... '' The ``employer'' in relation to a fund, is defined
as ``an employer participating in the fund''. These definitions and many
others in this Bill are helpful in the interpretation of law in the event
that there is a dispute.

Clause 3 of the Bill provides for a number of minimum benefits for a
member. The Bill provides minimum levels of pension increases and minimum
levels of interest added to member contributions in respect of any leavers.
This will prevent the degeneration, in future, of a surplus as a result of
the inequitable treatment of members leaving the fund and receiving pension
increases.

The Bill seems to be a fair compromise, as the interest groups which
negotiated it could not achieve consensus. Their positions were far apart
on several major issues. The PAC supports this Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the MF notes that at the closure of 1999, the
South African private retirement fund had a surplus concentrated within the
defined benefit funds of approximately R80 billion. Having viewed the
sources of this surplus, it is felt that the redistribution of the surplus
is necessary and correct. The Bill advocates an equitable redistribution
between all parties concerned.

The MF compliments the department on the provisions made for a set
procedure to culminate in the redistribution of the surplus proceeds. The
redress of the past inequitable benefit payments from the funds that have a
surplus will certainly have a positive impact and is applauded.

We should ensure that our workforce is given what they are entitled to. All
these corrections are welcomed. Each and every being, if spared, is
destined for old age, and pension funds are a major part of welfare
provision for the elderly. Bearing this in mind and our undertaking in the
Constitution, it is our duty to ensure that what is due is made available,
correctly and efficiently. It is sincerely felt that this Bill assists us
in this process and, if instituted correctly and efficiently, it will bring
the rewards and results intended.

The MF supports the Pension Funds Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, hierdie wetsontwerp hanteer 'n situasie
waarvan sowel dominees as politici nie juis veel ondervinding het nie,
naamlik surplusfondse. In wese is dit dus 'n lekker probleem. Iewers is
daar iets wat nie klop nie. Pensioenfondse sit met surplusfondse van meer
as R80 miljard. Terselfdertyd is daar talle pensioentrekkers wat veral in
die armer tye met pensioen gegaan het, wat kwalik 'n bestaan kan voer. Ons
kry hulle veral in ons ouetehuise. Dit is mense wat lewenslange diens
gelewer het of hul eggenotes, maar dan met die tyd en inflasie eenvoudig
net nie meer punte bymekaar kan kry nie. Ons verwelkom die wetgewing sodat
dit 'n beter bedeling, veral vir ons bejaardes kan skep. Veral verwelkom
ons die prioriteit wat voormalige werknemers geniet by die uitdeel van
fondse, sodat hulle pensioene eerste op 'n hoÃ«r vlak gebring kan word.

Daar is 'n groot diskrepansie tussen pensioentrekkers wat byvoorbeeld in
die tagtigerjare afgetree het en die van vandag. Ek wil twee belangrike
sake onderstreep. Eerstens, ons vind hierdie bejaardes onder die broodlyn
baie keer onder voormalige staatsamptenare. Wat is die posisie met
betrekking tot die staat se pensioenfondse en oorskotte? Kan die Minister
ons daarop 'n antwoord gee? Kan ons soiets ook daar verwag? Tweedens, die
onus rus op pensioentrekkers om in antwoord op advertensies te reageer ten
einde hul voordele te ontvang. Baie van hierdie mense het nie redelike
toegang tot koerante en ander media nie. Ons wil voorstel dat 'n spesiale
projek geloods word deur gebruik te maak van kerke, welsynsorganisasies en
ouetehuise om hierdie mense se nuwe regte onder hul aandag te bring, sodat
hulle daarop kan aanspraak maak.

Hierdie wetgewing lÃª my na aan die hart. In die bediening het ek
eerstehands kennis gemaak met mense wat veral op hul oudag moet sukkel.
Persoonlik is dit onmoontlik vir my wat nie op die portefeuljekomitee dien
nie, om op die hoogs tegniese punte kommentaar te lewer. Ons ondersteun
hierdie wetgewing. Ons mag nie toelaat dat fondse ophoop, terwyl hulle wat
oor die jare alles gegee het, onder die broodlyn leef nie. Ons wens die
Minister en sy departement alle sterkte toe met die implementering van
hierdie baie ingewikkelde saak.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, this Bill deals with a situation of which
both ministers of religion and politicians do not have much experience,
namely surplus funds. In essence it is therefore quite a tricky problem.
Somewhere there is something that does not add up. Pension funds have
surplus funds in excess of R80 billion. At the same time there are many
pensioners who went on pension in poorer times who can hardly survive. We
encounter them in our old age homes in particular. These are people who
worked all their lives, or their spouses, but who can, with time and
inflation, no longer make ends meet. We welcome the legislation so that a
better dispensation could be created, especially for our elderly. We
welcome in particular the priority that former employees enjoy at the
distribution of funds so that their pensions could be brought up to a
higher level.

There is a large discrepancy between pensioners who retired in the
eighties, for example, and those of today. I want to emphasise two
important matters. Firstly, we find that these elderly people who live
below the breadline are often former public servants. What is the position
in respect of the state pension funds and surpluses? Could the Minister
give us an answer in this regard? Could we expect something like this in
that area? Secondly, the onus rests on pensioners to react to
advertisements so as to receive their benefits. Many of these people do not
have ready access to newspapers and other media. We want to suggest that a
special project should be launched, using churches, welfare organisations
and old age homes to bring the new rights of these people to their
attention, so that they could claim them.

This legislation is dear to me. In the ministry of religion I personally
met people who have to struggle in their old age. It is impossible for me,
who does not serve on the portfolio committee, to comment on the highly
technical points. We support this legislation. We may not allow funds to
build up while they who have given their all throughout the years live
below the breadline. We wish the Minister and his department everything of
the best with the implementation of this very complicated matter.]
Mr B A MNGUNI: Mr Chairperson, this Bill is addressing a history that was
plagued by deceit and mistrust between labour and employers. The ignorant
and the powerless at the time, who had no say on the conditions under which
they were employed, saw their hard-earned remuneration packages slashed in
half when they resigned from their places of employment or when they were
dismissed. This Bill is trying to rectify that.

Clause 15K on specialist tribunals states that a dispute that may exist
will be resolved by the board. The board will try by all means to ensure
that labour and employers negotiate a proper settlement. Should that fail,
both parties can resort to an arbitrator who will be appointed by the
Pension Fund Adjudicator. If both parties are still not satisfied they can
go for a special tribunal. They notify the registrar and the special
tribunal will actually be constituted by at least three specialists, one of
whom must be an actuary, one a lawyer and anyone who is experienced in
pension or retirement funds. As these panelists will be appointed by both
stakeholders, that will ensure that the special tribunal has credibility
and everybody can trust it.  Moreover, it will be independent of any of the
stakeholders.

The remaining question is: How will a retrenched mineworker or an old
pensioner have confidence in the specialist tribunal? As already said, the
board itself is constituted by members, former members and employers. So in
the instance of a concerned poor mineworker down in the Free State in
Qwaqwa, or down in the Southern Free State around Koffiefontein, who is
retrenched from the diamond fields, this Bill will make sure that he has
representation on the board. The board will elect or nominate a panelist
who will sit when deliberations about the surplus are done. That is how
credibility will be created around this special tribunal. However, should
any of the parties still have a concern about the special tribunal or the
determination of the specialist tribunal, he can go to the court of law.
The specialist tribunal's determination, however, will be final and binding
except on the registrar.

Most of the time I usually like to say that the opposition should be given
an opportunity to make right what they did wrong in the past. I am
referring to the members of the opposition who were serving in the previous
government under the apartheid regime. It is no wonder that they support
this Bill because it cuts across colour lines. It matters not whether one
was white or black, when one resigned the salary was cut in half because
the employer would withdraw his or her contributions. [Interjections.] I
wonder how the hon member Mr Bekker, as one who supports the employers,
would feel if he had a surplus that was equal to that of the employer when
he resigns so that he can give it to the Government to make a better life
for other people.

The Bill goes further than making a better life for other people or for the
poor. From an economic point of view the Bill allows every member or
individual, who has the potential to go further in life or who has the
potential with regard to his profession, to deliver as his capacity allows
him or her to, because that person will be able to move from one job to
another without fearing that his or her pension will be cut. In that way it
encourages labour flexibility, which is a necessary part of a stable
economy that attracts investment and makes a better life for our people.

Lastly, I would like to congratulate the Minister on pushing through this
Bill so that the thousands of mineworkers who left their employment during
those times of retrenchments in the 1980s, who had no voice that
represented them in those mines and who were forced - under the closed-shop
agreement - to belong to labour organisations that did not represent them,
at least to get a fair share of the pensions that were unscrupulously taken
away from them by the employers. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! In order to comfort both the
last speaker and the Minister, the Chair is an office: it is neither male
nor female, except perhaps for the French grammar.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Mr Chairperson, let me start by expressing my
appreciation to all the parties, because I think the broad support that
this Bill received is indicative of not only the amount of due care and
attention that members have given, but also the general maturity. There
were moments in the debate when both sides had argued so strongly that it
could have gone either way, and I would really like to express my
appreciation for that.

Let me deal with the few concerns that were raised: In respect of the
issues raised by the hon Mr Andrew, I think the first point to recognise is
that legislation and regulation clearly need to keep up with an industry
where the rate of exchange is fastest. So with regard to issues relating to
a single regulator, going forward it is going to be important to deal with
it. I share his outrage on what the Financial Services Board had said about
losing records. It is completely unacceptable.

I will come back to the Public Service pension funds in a moment, to tidy
up what the hon Aucamp has raised. We are talking about surplus today, but
the one reality that I think we all must try to understand and engage with,
is that many funds, especially defined contribution funds, are losing money
hand over fist. A newspaper this past weekend published a table of funds
that are invested offshore. These funds are largely pension funds. About
50% of them are performing more poorly than even the exchange rate of
rental between the US dollar and the rand. That is exceedingly worrisome.
So whilst we may be talking about R80 billion in surpluses, the reality, in
respect of investment decisions that were taken where fund managers can
walk away, is that there is no responsibility for dealing with it.

The other issues before the committee, in relation to the Financial
Advisory and Intermediary Services Bill, FIAS, become exceedingly
important. But, as we said earlier, the key issue - and this arises across
the board from the concerns raised by all parties - is that we cannot leave
pensioners or members of pension funds or trustees without the necessary
education. The power relations in respect of decisions about investment are
too big to just leave people to their own devices. In concluding this
debate, my appeal is that we should all take an interest in this matter as
part of our constituency or past through work, to ensure that people are
equipped, and are able to ask the appropriate questions, and not try to get
at people with abusive jargon.

The issue I am concerned about today in dealing with the surpluses is,
perhaps, the loses accumulating in these funds right now. And I think that
is what is perhaps more important than the issues that the hon Dr Koornhof
raises, because I do not see a huge outflow of finances in the short-term
out of the funds. I mean in the way in which we have handled it, there is
no risk of negative equity resulting from this.

I think the key issue is the battle for ethical considerations. That has
very much been the centrepiece of what has constructed this broad consensus
that we have here this afternoon. The ethical considerations about who owns
what. And I think if that continues to guide us and if we recognise that
even trustees in the technical committee can be confused by issues they do
not understand, then we recognise that it is not just the legislation. It
is about the care and support that we can provide to people who often feel
that some of these issues are not what they immediately understand.

Let me just touch on the Public Service pension fund. The first point to
make in respect of what Dominee Aucamp raises is that there is not a
surplus in the country. In respect of the issues of law, we have a pension
fund law passed through because it was tied in to the old Public Service
Act, negotiated in the central bargaining chamber and, because of the way
in which that law was styled, the agreement on establishing the pension
fund then had the force of legislation approved by Parliament.

In terms of that legislation there are meant to be 12 trustees. This was
passed through, I think, in about March 1996. This comprised twelve
trustees, that is six employers and six employees. Every time we try and
negotiate because the unions cannot present us with six trustees, because
the risk of the Minister of Finance being the sole trustee goes against the
entire spirit of everything we are discussing. If one accepts as a given
that the pension fund does not belong to the employer, then the fact that I
serve as the sole trustee is wrong.

I would like to assure hon members, including the hon Andrew, that this
issue has been on the agenda of the Public Service central bargaining
chamber year after year, because it is not a responsibility we want, and it
is a failure on the part of the unions to resolve this issue, and for that
reason, as members know, I have stepped back from the Public Investment
Commission as I have nothing to do with it, because it would create a
conflict. But, certainly, we want the Public Service or the Government's
employees' pension fund to be in exactly the same position. It is still a
defined benefit fund, and the issues here relate primarily to the way we
have had to change from defined benefits to defined contributions. Unlike
us, the public office bearers, we have a defined contribution fund, and I
know that members are concerned. But, there is a board of trustees, and we
know the board is ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, your time has
expired.

The MINISTER: Chairperson, I trust that I was able to respond to the
concerns raised. Let us keep the discussions alive. We must try to do that,
because they affect us and, more importantly, we have a responsibility to
people out there who would be affected by pension funds. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

Papers:

1.    The Minister of Finance:


     Written Explanation from the Minister of Finance in terms of section
     65(2)(a) of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999)
     setting out the reasons why the South African Revenue Service could not
     table its Annual Report and Financial Statements for 2000-2001 in time:


         Written Explanation in terms of section 65(2)(a) of the Public
         Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999) for late tabling
         of Annual Report and Financial Statements


         In terms of section 55 of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999,
         the South African Revenue Service (SARS) must prepare and submit
         its financial statements to the Auditor-General and the relevant
         treasury within two months after the end of the financial year.
         The audited financial statements must be submitted to the relevant
         treasury and to the Minister of Finance within five months of the
         end of that financial year.  Section 65 of the Public Finance
         Management Act, 1999, provides that the annual report and
         financial statements must be tabled in National Assembly within
         six months after the end of the relevant financial year.


         The financial statements of SARS, as a public entity, must be
         prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice
         (GAAP), unless the Accounting Standards Board approves the
         application of Generally Recognised Accounting Practice (GRAP). As
         the Accounting Standards Board has not been appointed yet, the
         Accountant General (National Treasury), performing the functions
         of the Board in terms of section 93(3) of the Public Finance
         Management Act, 1999, approved the application of GRAP on 21Â May
         2001.


         Section 91(1)(b) of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999,
         however, also requires that the Minister of Finance must issue
         regulations prescribing the standards set by the Accounting
         Standards Board (in this case the National Treasury), before these
         standards can apply. Approval, in principle, was granted for the
         publication of these regulations and the regulations were
         published for public comment on 6 September 2001. Once the
         deadline for comment expires on 8 October 2001, the final
         regulations will be published after taking into account any
         comments received.


         In terms of section 55 of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999,
         the audited financial statements had to be submitted to the
         relevant treasury and the Minister of Finance before 31 August
         2001. As the regulations prescribing GRAP had not at that stage
         been published yet, SARS requested extension until 31 October 2001
         for the submission of the audited financial statements, which
         extension was approved by me on 14 August 2001.


         The annual report containing the financial statements can,
         therefore, not be tabled in National Assembly by the end of
         September 2001, as required by section 65 of the Public Finance
         Management Act, 1999, as the financial statements will only be
         finalised after the regulations setting the standards of GRAP have
         been published.

     Report and Financial Statements of the Department of Transport for 2000-
