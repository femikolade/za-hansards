                   ANNIVERSARY OF ADOPTION OF CONSTITUTION

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I would like to welcome you back
from your recess. I would also like to remind you and South Africa that
today is the fifth anniversary of the adoption of our Constitution.
[Applause.]

I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate South Africa on the
new Constitution and on the way that we have tackled the challenges of
building our new democracy guided by the Constitution, which itself, of
course, was a challenge to us as we were putting it together. May we
continue to bravely face the challenges of nurturing this very delicate and
young democracy. May we succeed.

                                 NEW MEMBER

                               (Announcement)

The Deputy Speaker announced that the vacancy caused by the resignation of
Gen C L Viljoen had been filled, in accordance with item 6(3) of Schedule 6
to the Constitution, 1996, by the nomination of Mr P J Groenewald with
effect from 1 May 2001.

                                 AFFIRMATION

Mr P J Groenewald, accompanied by Dr C P Mulder and Dr P W A Mulder, made
the affirmation and took his seat.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms P N MNANDI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a group composed of black professionals placed an
       advertisement in the weekend newspapers, condemning the vicious
       attacks on the President by right-wing forces under the guise of
       liberal politics;


  (2) believes that the sentiments expressed in this advertisement
       represent the views of the majority of our people who support the ANC
       and the President in uniting our people for change; and


  (3) reiterates the views expressed in this advertisement and commends
       President Thabo Mbeki for his steadfast resolve and commitment to the
       creation of a caring society, the eradication of poverty and a better
       life for all.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]
Mr R S NTULI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) recognises that disparities exist regarding facilities between
       historically disadvantaged schools and former Model C schools as well
       as independent schools;


  (2) notes that the solution to these disparities does not lie in
       destabilising and disrupting learning and teaching in former Model C
       schools and independent schools;


  (3) therefore strongly condemns the announcement by Cosas that they
       intend disrupting such institutions;


  (4) reaffirms the constitutional right of such schools to exist; and


  (5) encourages the Minister of Education to continue with his stand to
       affirm the right of such schools to operate.

[Applause.]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) reseverdly accepts the Minister of Education's view that
       dysfunctional governing bodies should be replaced;


  (2) acknowledges that the effectiveness of governing bodies will realise
       the need and desire for co-operative governance and democracy;


  (3) cautions that a daring step to replace governing bodies with curators
       appointed by the superintendent-general of education would defeat the
       very core of co-operative and participatory democracy; and
  (4) pleads with the Minister of Education to assist the provincial
       departments of Education in making more funds available for the
       training of the ailing governing bodies, thereby providing these
       bodies with the necessary technical skills.

Mrs M S MAINE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with satisfaction the editorial comment in Business Day  which
       supports unequivocally the hon the President, Mr Thabo Mbeki;


  (2) believes that this statement confirms our long-held view that the
       President runs the country meticulously; and


  (3) calls on the progressive NGOs, the media and civil society to emulate
       this example and mobilise our people in partnership with Government
       to unite in action to eradicate the twin scourges of poverty and
       racism.

[Applause.]

Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the latest estimates show that there are at least 4,7
       million HIV-infected South Africans, with another 1 700 being
       infected daily;


  (2) further notes that the private sector is -


       (a)  drafting a treatment plan that will supply cheap antiretroviral
           drugs to workers; and


       (b)  taking the lead in the fight against HIV/Aids, due to the
           Government's inactivity and lack of any programmes to deal with
           the HIV/Aids epidemic; and


  (3) welcomes the initiative taken by the private sector and urges the
       Government to support this Aids drugs campaign and not to stand in
       the way of making HIV/Aids treatment widely and cheaply available to
       the people of South Africa.

[Applause.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with trepidation that the bodies investigating the arms deal
       are continuing with their investigation, launched by Scopa, despite
       the fact that Scopa has not issued the terms of reference for the
       investigation;


  (2) further notes that the investigative team has unilaterally announced
       their intent, without consulting Scopa or Parliament, to conduct
       hearings in public;
  (3) expresses its concern regarding the subpoenas being issued by the
       investigators, which have served to shift public attention onto the
       whistle-blowers as opposed to the suspects; and


  (4) calls on the investigators to clarify whether they are operating on
       the terms of reference of Scopa, the Executive, the ruling party or
       their own.

[Applause.]

Ms N E HANGANA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that two thirds of the people of South Africa voted for the ANC
       in the last election;


  (2) recognises that the ANC's support is based on its policies and
       principles built on 90 years of commitment to dignity, equality,
       democracy and freedom;
  (3) cautions those opposed to transformation that attempts to weaken the
       ANC through attacks on its President and its leaders will prove
       futile, for its strength lies in its policies and history, its vision
       and its ability to bring about change; and


  (4) reaffirms its support for the President, the leadership, and the
       policies of the ANC .

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

The hon members there should shut up!

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with great concern threats by the Congress of South African
       Students to disrupt private school classes and interfere with the
       transport of pupils;


  (2) further notes that if state subsidies were withdrawn, private school
       fees would be much higher than public school fees;


  (3) cautions Cosas not to resort to lawlessness that would deny some
       students their constitutional right to education;


  (4) advises Cosas to use their energy and time wisely in studying and
       ensuring that students who aimlessly roam our townships and towns
       during school hours return to the classroom where they should be;


  (5) commends the Minister of Education for his decision that, should
       Cosas go ahead with its plan, the police would be called in to
       protect property, and the innocent lives of students and teachers,
       and to arrest all those breaking the law; and


  (6) commends the Minister of Education for the strong stand he has taken
       on this issue, thus ensuring that valuable hours of teaching and
       learning are not lost due to unlawful activities by misguided
       students.

Dr C P MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem van die uiters onbevredigende toestand waarin die totale
       openbare vervoersisteem in en om Kaapstad tans verkeer;


  (2) die besluit van die sakegemeenskap van die stad, om hierdie week die
       provinsiale kabinet te ontmoet om by hulle aan te dring op dringende
       oplossings vir hierdie probleem, ten volle ondersteun;


  (3) van mening is dat hierdie swak en onvoldoende vervoersisteem beslis
       besig is om besighede en toerisme in die stad negatief te raak; en


  (4) 'n dringende beroep doen op die DA provinsiale regering om hierdie
       probleem wat hulle oor die afgelope paar jaar reeds moes
       ge√Ødentifiseer en reggestel het, nou onmiddellik aan te pak en op te
       los.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the extremely unsatisfactory condition in which the entire
       public transport system in and around Cape Town currently finds
       itself;


  (2) fully supports the decision by the business community of the city to
       meet with the provincial cabinet this week in order to insist on
       urgent solutions to this problem;


  (3) is of the opinion that this poor and inadequate transport system is
       definitely having a negative impact on businesses and tourism in the
       city; and


  (4) makes an urgent appeal to the DA provincial government immediately to
       address and solve this problem, which they should already have
       identified and corrected in the course of the past few years.]
Ms N M TWALA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the recent historic victory by the ANC-led Department of Health
       over pharmaceutical companies;


  (2) believes that this victory confirms the ANC's commitment to the
       provision of affordable medicines for all the people;


  (3) further believes that through this victory the ANC has guaranteed
       access to medicines by the poor;


  (4) applauds the court's ruling to uphold the Medicines Control Act,
       which enables the expansion of access to cheap and effective
       medicines; and


  (5) congratulates the ANC for winning this battle and for boldly
       representing the interests of the underprivileged in society.

[Applause.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That this House -


  (1) notes that from 1 May the City of Cape Town became the first unicity
       to fulfil its election promise of delivering 6 000 litres of water
       free to every household in the municipality;


  (2) congratulates the DA-run municipality for delivering on its election
       promise and for making an impact on the quality of life of all the
       people in the municipality;


  (3) encourages the preparations by the City of Cape Town to supply 20kw
       of free electricity to council-served households in the municipality
       from 1 July; and


  (4) calls on the other ANC-run megacities - Nelson Mandela, Ekurhuleni,
       Tshwane and Johannesburg - to follow the example of the DA in the
       City of Cape Town.

[Applause.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) in response to the warning from environmentalists with concerns about
       the regulation of genetically modified organisms, notes that -


       (a)  the science of genetic modification is still in its infancy;


       (b)  the effect of genetically modified crops on surrounding
           vegetation is difficult to monitor and the effect on the public
           of eating such crops is far-reaching;


       (c)  accountability for the damaging effects to health or natural
           crops caused by cross-pollination by GMOs is not clearly
           specified in our legislation;


       (d)  the onus for harmful side-effects resulting from the use of GMOs
           does not fall squarely on producers;


       (e)  labelling of foodstuffs as free of GMOs is difficult to monitor;
           and


       (f)  while the Departments of Agriculture, of Environmental Affairs
           and Tourism and of Health each fulfil their prescribed role,
           there is inadequate co-ordination between them; and


  (2) calls on the Ministers of these departments to work more closely on
       GMO legislation, to work more closely and transparently with civil
       society, and to seriously consider calling for a five-year moratorium
       on GMO production.

Mr R D PIETERSE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the recent reluctant implementation of the ANC's free basic
       water-to-all policy by the DA-controlled Cape Town Unicity Council;


  (2) also notes that the Durban City Council had successfully implemented
       this policy long before the elections;


  (3) commends the ANC and its followers in Tafelsig, Khayelitsha,
       Macassar, Guguletu, Mannenberg and Langa for forcing the DA to
       implement the ANC's humane policies; and


  (4) calls on the DA to further prioritise other ANC policies for
       immediate and long-term implementation so that the people of Cape
       Town and the Western Cape can also benefit from the ANC's policies
       for the many, not just the few.
[Applause.]

Mr H A SMIT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the tragedy caused by the cholera outbreak in the Durban-
       Westville prison;


  (2) acknowledges that the situation is worsened by the fact that the
       prison is 131% overcrowded;


  (3) expresses its condolences to the family of the deceased and wishes
       the infected prisoners a speedy recovery;


  (4) calls on the Department of Health to lend their support and to help
       get the situation under control;


  (5) urges the Department of Correctional Services to implement the
       necessary precautions to make sure released prisoners will not spread
       the disease; and


  (6) believes that the outbreak of cholera in the Durban-Westville prison
       is a crisis and must be dealt with accordingly.

Mr D G MKONO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes with cautious optimism the announcement by President Chiluba
       of Zambia that he will not be standing for a third term;


  (2) congratulates the Zambians on their vigilance in preventing a member
       of the ruling elite from changing the country' constitution;


  (3) calls on the ANC to acknowledge that the will of the people will
       never be subverted by the will of the elite; and


  (4) calls on the ANC to refrain from changing the Constitution in order
       for President Mbeki to serve a third term as President.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, on a point of order ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! What is the point of order?

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Given the fact that an hon member of the FF was sworn in
after a long absence from the House, should not the hon member Winnie
Mandela also be sworn in after her long absence from the House? [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! That is a very naughty point of order.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 29 - Minerals and Energy:

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President
and hon members, it gives me great pleasure to stand here today and
appraise you of the developments in the Department of Minerals and Energy.

Slowly but surely, we are making our way. The beacon of hope shines through
ever so brightly. Our people have demonstrated their readiness to make
tough choices and to take the difficult road to the land of milk and honey.
As representatives of the people, we should always remember, as Alfred,
Lord Tennyson once said, and I quote:


  ... and tho'
  We are not now that strength which in old days
  Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;
  One equal temper of heroic hearts,
  Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
  To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
I would like to start by recapping what we said during our Vote debate last
year. During that Vote debate we presented this House with a set of plans
designed to assist us in the task of carrying out the mandate of our
portfolio. Today, my Deputy Minister and I will share with you the progress
that we have made in implementing those plans. We will recap on both the
highs and the lows of the past year and on some of the key deliverables
that we promised.

The year 2000 was a productive year for our department. Each directorate
can boast of the successful implementation of many programmes. It is,
however, noteworthy that the current Department of Minerals and Energy
budget still indicates a more that 60% transfer to our associated bodies.
Out of the 40% balance, only 19% is for the department and 31% for
electrification. This therefore should indicate to hon members how tight
the budget of the Department of Minerals and Energy is and how essential it
is to us that we use every cent in the best possible way.

Although this is indicative of the department's commitment to put resources
into social development programmes and effective implementation of policy,
it is also clear that this is a very underresourced department. For the
current year, the department's responsibility, budget wise, has increased
by 50%, with the inclusion of the national electrification programme. The
department has subsequently requested additional funds that will ensure the
implementation of the new approved structure.

The following are areas that we concentrated on last year. Therefore some
of the work will be ongoing, and some of the major challenges facing us
will be the new additional tasks, such as the national electrification
programme previously undertaken by Eskom.

In the area of management service, last year we focused on the department's
strategic plans and on ensuring that we align the departmental plans with
the broader strategic objectives of Government. We focused on skills
development and empowerment, in particular gender equity. We focused on
developing a performance management system. We also focused on re-
engineering our organisation in order to align our size and shape with our
responsibilities.

In the area of rural development, we continued with the efficient and
effective regulation of the mining industry, we abolished the Lebowa
Mineral Trust as part of the realignment of our institutions with the
current constitutional dispensation. We also released the long-awaited
draft Bill on minerals. We restructured some of the entities that fall
under our ambit. We also made sure that we started implementing the
outcomes of the mining summit. In relation to the implementation of the
mining summit, we also incorporated some of the resolutions of the mining
summit into our Bill on minerals development in order to ensure that some
of those long-term objectives are institutionalised.

We have also made vigorous efforts to ensure that we focus on mine
rehabilitation and, in that respect, ensure that we protect our communities
from undue environmental hazards. We also made a commitment in regard to
mine health and safety, which the Deputy Minister will address. In relation
to energy, we committed ourselves to energisation, specifically the
integration of different energy sources, we committed ourselves to the
development of an integrated energy plan, and we committed ourselves to the
diversification of energy sources, inter alia, the introduction of natural
gas and renewables.

We also committed ourselves to the restructuring of the energy sector,
especially electricity, in order to keep energy as a low input cost for
commercial and domestic users. Specifically in relation to energy, amongst
our undertakings for 2000, we wanted to make sure that we sustained the
excellent progress made by Eskom in the implementation of the RDP
electrification plan in order to come closer to attaining our universal
target, and I am glad to say that the vigour with which the electrification
programme has been carried out has not been interrupted.

We also focused on developing a national integrated electrification plan
which is computerised. We developed a plan to mitigate against the negative
environmental impacts of coal and fossil fuels. We also made progress on
the long-awaited electricity distribution industry restructuring strategy,
and presented to Cabinet an electricity supply industry restructuring
policy. We moved with speed and success to solve the problems of governance
within the National Electricity Regulator, and successfully positioned it
as one of the best regulators that the country has ever seen.

In relation to hydrocarbons we announced the task team to drive the process
for black economic empowerment in the liquid fuel sector. I am glad to
report that it has culminated in a charter adopted by the industry and
relevant Government bodies, and is now being implemented. We drafted the
gas Bill, which is now on its way to Parliament. We have no doubt that it
will be passed before the end of this year - in fact, in the first half of
this year.

We also committed ourselves to signing cross-border agreements with
Mozambique and Namibia, in order to facilitate the importation of gas. We
have already signed the agreement with Mozambique and we are waiting to
sign the same agreement with Namibia. We have established a state gas
pipeline development company, as we promised, in order to facilitate the
construction of gas infrastructure by the state, as we anticipate the
introduction of gas into our economy.

We also promised that we would merge Soekor and Mossgas into a state oil
company. We have now completed the legalities of that process and we are
well underway also in finalising the details, to ensure that an appropriate
business plan and a business case for this merger is in place.

We promised the House a strategic stock policy, and that policy was
developed and adopted by Cabinet. These are some of the promises that we
made last year and some of the progress, in brief, that we have made. We
made a commitment to the House as well in relation to nuclear energy and
renewables. The Deputy Minister will address those aspects in detail. The
Deputy Minister and I will also report to this House on some of the
developments that we regard as vital to the effective implementation of our
mandate.

With regard to performance management, in order to ensure cost-
effectiveness and quality of expenditure, the performance management and
development system which was anticipated in the year 2000 budget speech on
the Vote has now been developed and was implemented in April 2001. High-
level workplans have been compiled and these provide a foundation for key
performance areas of all programme managers in the department.

We have also proceeded to develop a new structure and presented it to the
Minister for the Public Service and Administration, who has also approved
it. We are now, starting from this financial year, restructuring ourselves
quite fundamentally, particularly the energy branch, which has the least
number of posts needed to cope with the major responsibilities that we
have. So next year we will be able to report how those changes have
impacted on our delivery in that branch.

In relation to human resource development and capacity-building, we have
undertaken extensive training of both our own staff and members of the
public, as well as young students. We have an exciting programme which we
are implementing jointly with Petronas in Malaysia. As we are talking, more
than 20 South African students are undergoing extensive training in the
area of gas, oil and other related fields.

We have established an internship policy, which has been finalised.
Therefore we have been able to bring young people into the department, who
are acquiring skills. For the first time they have jobs, and they have been
able to assist us to address our capacity problem.

I would now like to address what has happened in relation to mineral
development. For more than a century South Africa's mineral industry was
largely supported by gold, diamond, coal and platinum production. These
minerals made a contribution to the national economy and continue to do so.

The mineral sector, comprising both the primary and secondary sectors,
continues to play a critical role in our exports and in relation to job
creation. We have therefore undertaken, as agreed also in the mining
summit, to ensure that we promote this sector extensively. This saw us
participating in many exhibitions at home and abroad, bringing on board
junior and small miners, promoting South Africa's minerals at international
stands in Canada, Zambia, Burkina Faso and Cape Town.

Mintec and the Geoscience Council will continue to play a critical role as
respected institutions, not just in South Africa, but also around the
world. They have also played a decisive role in ensuring that these
endeavours are successful.

Through the mineral promotion division of the department, more than 5 000
information booklets were also published and distributed. We have also
improved the turnaround time required to issue licences and to provide the
various services that the public requires.

In 1998 the Government adopted the White Paper on Minerals and Mining
Policy in South Africa. This document was the result of consultations with
various stakeholders over a period of four years. The draft Bill on
minerals development crafts into law the principles contained in
Government's policy on minerals and mining. These policy principles are
therefore not up for renegotiation.

The consultations on the Bill that we are undertaking are about the
implementation of these policy principles. We have gained a lot from the
public comments, and we are now ready to incorporate these comments into
the Bill in order to improve it and to ensure that there are no unintended
consequences in its implementation.

In giving impact to these policy principles, we are cognisant of the need
to protect established business and new entrants. We will ensure that both
parties realise their return on their investments and that their
shareholder interests are not compromised.

We are committed to ensuring that applicants for prospecting in mining
rights, who have complied with the requirements of the proposed
legislation, are granted the rights they applied for. We are also committed
to ensuring that where people have legitimate expectations - as set out in
the use-it-or-lose-it principle - to continue their work, they are not
interrupted.

The implementation of the Bill will ensure that the ownership pattern and
character of this industry is changed forever. Significant black economic
empowerment must be the result of this Bill. The Bill must also usher in a
better dispensation for the downtrodden workers in the mining industry and
the communities that are affected by mining.

We acknowledge that historically we have had a raw deal in this sector, and
we feel that this must now be corrected, as instructed by the Constitution.
This must, however, not be done at the expense of - and in the process
destruct - the established and existing institutions and projects. Within
the context of the African Renaissance, this industry will go a long way
towards assisting us to achieve the goals set in the Millennium African
Recovery Programme.

The use-it-or-lose-it principle is, therefore, there to protect existing
operators and ensure that new entrants, both foreign and local, are given
an opportunity to enter the industry. It protects the existing operators in
the sense that if one is using it, one is not losing it. But it also
encourages new entrants in that if existing operations lose it, then we
have something that we can offer them.

We are obviously concerned about some of the discussions and debates around
the Bill which have compromised the image of the country to some extent. At
a recent meeting, at Nedlac, one of the representative of Nafcoc stated,
and I quote:


  The negative perception on the Bill created by established mining
  companies has created more harm to South Africa than any single clause in
  the draft Bill.

We hope that before people bad-mouth the country, they will also ensure
that they think about the long-term consequences of this approach.
With regard to energy, which is a critical sector in our economy, we have
also made great strides. I have already mentioned that the Department of
Minerals and Energy will now become involved in actually facilitating the
electrification programme. We have also made progress in relation to the
electricity distribution industry. The six regional distributors of
electricity that are envisaged will be established. We anticipate that this
will happen around 2003. However, in the middle of this year we will
establish the holding company which will take the responsibility for
unfolding this process. The stronger municipalities will, in that process,
support the weaker municipalities, and the strengths of Eskom in
distribution will be incorporated in the new system.

Government has also adopted a programme to alleviate poverty in communities
by offering free energy and free water. I am glad to say that it is not
actually accurate that the Western Cape is the first municipality to embark
on this undertaking. Pietersburg did so long ago, Tshwane announced that
they have started and Durban began long ago. Cape Town has just come on
board and we congratulate them because that is noble. [Applause.]

What is being offered in this programme is 50 kwh per household, which will
save our people about R40 a month. It will allow them cooking time of three
hours per day free, four hours of lighting per day free, three hours of
ironing per day free, and access to television, radio and computers for
about six hours a day per month. However, this cannot be accumulated. If a
family does not utilise the service in a particular month, it does not mean
that they will be able to use it in the next month. They must use it or
lose it.

The National Electricity Regulator now has a new board, and I am sure this
board will continue with the same high level of governance as the previous
board. Mr Colin Matjila will now be the new chairman of this board. We will
be bringing to Parliament the Bill on energy before the end of this year,
and in that way we will be able to craft, in legislation, some of the
principles that are embodied in our energy policy.

We have also made progress in the area of liquid fuels, as I have
indicated, and we are also making progress within the state institutions.
The restructuring of a group of companies is under way. Mossgas and Soekor
will now be merged into one company. Before the end of this year we will be
in a position to announce, and to establish, the state oil company.

Together with the state's institution and the private sector we will be
embarking on a managed liberalisation of the sector. This will see, in some
cases, regulation, and in other cases, self-regulation. We anticipate that
over a period of 10 years we will have changed this industry, and ensured
that as we change it, we have been able to create a safe location for our
people within the industry through the deals that are currently being
negotiated between the established merger and the black economic
empowerment companies.

I have said that the Deputy Minister will speak about renewable energy. I
would just like to highlight that we are attaching a lot of importance to
that sector, because we realise that our dependence on coal does challenge
us in relation to the environment, and renewable energy offers some of our
small businesses the opportunity to enter the energy sector.

I would like to end by announcing sad news. Today, at Beatrix Gold Fields
mine in the Free State, there was an explosion, possibly associated with
methane gas at the no 1 shaft, sixth level. Eight workers are unaccounted
for, four bodies have been recovered and five workers have been injured. It
is this kind of challenge we face that makes it imperative that, as we
enter the regulation of this sector, we as a government take the
responsibility of making sure that the Minister and the Government have
adequate powers to intervene in order to make sure that the industry
adheres to the highest possible standards of safety, as required by the
laws of the land.

We would like to express our condolences to the families and we will, as
usual, be supporting the company concerned. Obviously we will also be
taking a very hard line to establish if this could have been averted,
because one death in this industry and in this country is one death too
many. [Applause.]

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Madam Speaker, first of all I would like to associate the
DA with the condolences that the Minister expressed in respect to the mine
accident. Last year the DP supported the budget of the Minister and her
department in that we recognised that, notwithstanding certain glaring
problems faced by the industries covered by her department, the Minister,
new to her portfolio, was making determined efforts to address these
problems.

With this mind we were patient, perhaps too patient, because one year down
the line we must register our disappointment for, notwithstanding at times
much publicity hype, we detect little real substantive progress. Let me add
that our own sense of disappointment is enhanced by a similar sense that we
pick up in our interaction with business and other institutions which deal
with the Ministry.

Let me be more specific. In respect of the energy sector, we began to see
the beginnings of major interventions by Government in order to start the
process of deregulation and privatisation. This was to be welcomed.
However, it is becoming increasingly evident that many of the initiatives
are being bogged down by ideological constraints, administrative incapacity
and possible lack of adequate research, all of this leading to indecision
and inaction.

Four years after the release of the White Paper on energy policy, we have
yet to see the much talked about, highly necessary but little seen,
integrated energy policy. Despite this, Government proceeds with
initiatives to restructure the electricity industry, broadens the role that
nuclear energy will play in the total energy mix of South Africa, tables
legislation enabling gas to become a more competitive player in the
industry, and crafts a laudable but somewhat hollow Black Economic
Empowerment Charter for the liquid fuels industry which does nothing to
advance the essential restructuring of that industry.

Many of these initiatives may well be good in themselves, but outside of an
integrated policy framework, these initiatives could well end up by working
against one another. Let me give you a classic example. In the Western Cape
and in the Northern Cape nuclear energy is a major power producer. Gas
fields are about to come on stream, but they need anchored customers, such
as the City of Cape Town and Mossgas, in order to make their exploitation
viable.

Yet the energy field is becoming overcrowded. Not only do we have an
independent power producer in Cape Town, but Government has now given Eskom
the go-ahead to conduct a detailed feasibility study of the proposed
nuclear pebble-bed reactor. While this is a study, critics argue that
Eskom, in the development of this project, has proceeded with little regard
to the Government's White Paper, and is so far down the line in the
development of the reactors that Government will have little option but to
agree to their development.

In all this, of course, the much-vaunted renewable energy policy seems to
have been lost, and I look to what the Deputy Minister has to say as far as
that is concerned. Clearly the department needs to get its act together.
Now we in the DA agree that Government's job is not to make commercial
decisions for companies in the energy sector, but what Government has to do
is provide a clear policy framework within which commercial companies can
assess the opportunities and take risks.

The restructuring of the electricity industry is another example in which,
conceptually, an excellent Government initiative seems to be coming unstuck
because of a policy that has not been adequately thought through.
Restructuring the industry with a view to unbundling it into three
different areas of activity, namely generation, transmission and
distribution, has been debated since the early 1990s. Government appointed
a task team, Price Waterhouse Coopers, to come up with recommendations in
respect of the distribution industry. This they did, after years of
research and interaction with stakeholders. Cabinet, however, has now
rejected the blueprint and has appointed yet another committee of so-called
experts to review the work of Price Waterhouse Coopers. With several
fundamental issues unresolved, it seems as if it could well be back to the
drawing board completely.

Turning to the liquid fuels industry, we find yet another example of an
initiative grinding to a halt. Having set itself the objective in the White
Paper of a deregulated industry, a step which the industry as a whole
welcomed because of the real potential of consequent lower fuel prices at
the pump, the Government then made such deregulation dependent on the
achievement of a number of milestones, one of which was the laudable
objective of black empowerment companies achieving a 25% stake in the
industry.

With rising fuel prices one would have thought that deregulation or, at
least, reregulation, would have been an absolute priority. Instead, after
four years of Government treading water, a wishy-washy, self-enforcing
charter is produced, so vague that a proverbial bus or, more appropriately,
petrol tanker can be driven through it. The real effect is to put the
deregulation timetable back by 10 years.

The mineral sector has likewise been plagued by inaction and missed
opportunities. Faced with problems regarding the operating effectiveness of
the SA Diamond Board, and more particularly, the diamond valuator, a task
team known as the Taljaard task team was set up to investigate complaints
regarding co-operate governance in the board. An investigation was held,
which confirmed most of the allegations and appropriate recommendations
were made, which the Minister accepted. Yet, one year down the line most of
the recommendations remain substantially unimplemented. Meanwhile the
board, once one of our most financially healthy organisations, now hovers
on the brink of insolvency.

More inaction is seen with regard to the Mining Summit held last year. Held
amid much publicity, the summit focused on various initiatives designed to
turn around an ailing industry characterised by massive retrenchements.
Four areas were focused on, namely, a strategy to promote the industry;
promoting the concept of mining and tourism; promoting mining potential in
SADC countries and smallscale mining. One year down the line, I only hear
of smallscale mining, and little has been heard of the rest.

Finally with regard to the mining industry, the initiative referred to by
the Minister and by Government to facilitate easy access by the
disadvantaged to mineral rights seems to be coming unstuck. This time we
say thank goodness because, in the face of major opposition by both
domestic and international investors, Government seems to be having a
rethink over its clumsy attempt to circumvent the Constitution, and now
seems to be opening the way for major changes to the draft Bill, by the
announcement of the preparation of a new draft and the appointment of an
international advisory panel to advise Government on the Bill.

The question has to be asked: Why did Government not take heed of earlier
warnings by institutions such as the Chamber of Mines, of the likely
consequences of the Bill as far as investment is concerned? And more
particularly, why did the Minister renege on an undertaking given to the
chamber to enter into intense constructive negotiations of the draft Bill
prior to its publication?
In closing, I would be remiss if I did not mention the Strategic Fuel Fund
scandal. Here the country's strategic fuel reserve was effectively
privatised and sold off by persons appointed by the Minister, a deed done
notwithstanding the Minister having a representative on the board. Despite
the Minister claiming that she knew nothing of the transaction, which I
accept, such a scandal would have resulted, in any mature democracy, in the
Minister submitting her resignation to the President.

What we have witnessed is that she has good intentions, but little action,
prevarication and indecision have become the hallmarks of this department,
resulting in lost opportunities. Our patience has come to an end. We await
the Minister's response before we decide on whether to support the
department's budget this time around. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Madam Speaker, members of
Parliament, members of the department, distinguished guests, Douglas must
stop provoking me. [Laughter.]

In the past years several milestones have been achieved along the route to
transforming the minerals and energy industry and its promotion of the
growth of the national economy. Therefore it is my privilege today to
present the second part of the budget speech of our department. Perhaps, to
recap a bit, the hon member Davidson needs to tell this House and the world
the truth about the development and progress which we have made as a
department. Some of the issues he is raising have been resolved. I think he
needs to be informed, and I hope he does attend the portfolio committee
meetings from time to time, so as to ensure that his information is
updated. Some of the things he has said have reached a stalemate.

As a result of a concerted effort by the department, we can proudly report
today in this House that ERPM Gold Mine, which is on the East Rand, has
reopened under new ownership. Therefore the question of black empowerment
is real, and it is part of this Government's duty to ensure that we
continuously empower our people, contrary to what the past regime did. With
ERPM we have managed to save 2 500 jobs, and at the same time were able to
maximise the state's financial and environmental interest.

As stated by the Minister, in pursuance of Goverment's job creation
initiatives, a highly successful mining summit was organised, which had as
its most important outputs a shared vision of a sunrise mining industry and
agreed strategies in all the key areas of mining and mineral development.
In managing the downscaling in the mining industry and developing a mining
industry social plan and assistance, mechanisms were developed to reduce
job losses. We are all aware that two marginal mines in Gauteng have been
saved.

When it comes to the area of mine health and safety and rehabilitation, the
department is currently actively involved in continued planning and project
management pertaining to the rehabilitation of derelict and ownerless
asbestos mines and mine residue deposits. Most of these asbestos mines
closed down more than 40 years ago and are a serious hazard to us.

This is not part of our problem, but we, as the department and the
Government, are nevertheless committed to ensuring that there is
rehabilitation in order to improve the health of our people. We are
currently rehabilitating the Whitebank asbestos mine in Kuruman, and we
have spent many millions of rands to ensure that we are able to deal with
this matter as part of our commitment. Whilst we acknowledge that the task
ahead of us is enormous, to date we have succeeded in rehabilitating a
total of 53 mines in the Mpumalanga province, the Northern Cape province
and the Northern Province.

In the area of mine health and safety, I also have to refer to the award
systems for excellence in mining and environmental management. Considerable
progress has been made with the implementation of this system on a regional
basis. Within the nine provinces, 86 nominations have been received. These
nominations were screened in the regions according to predetermined,
acceptable criteria. Nominations were received in all four categories,
which are small opencast, large opencast, underground and offshore
operations.

The evaluation of the regional nominations was finalised during October and
November 2000, and regional prize-giving ceremonies have taken place to
award winners in each category with floating trophies and replacing and
rating certificates. This system will follow a two-year cycle; the first
will be regional awards and the second will be national awards.
Improved safety performance, as the Minister has indicated, is one of our
priorities. Since the introduction of the Mine Health and Safety Act in
1996, the fatality rate, which was 1,2 employees killed in mine accidents
per 1 000 employees in 1995, has steadily declined to the current level of
0,72 per 1 000 mine employees. As the Minister has pointed out, this is not
enough and we are currently committed to ensuring that we move towards a
situation of no fatalities in the mining industry, and we will continue to
strive for improvement in this particular area.

Although mine health and safety statistics show that the safety performance
in the mining industry has improved, as has the causal rate associated with
rock bursts, we want to say that the situation has not improved. The number
of accidents associated with transport and machinery remains, again,
significant, and the control of flammable gas remains a cause for concern
for all of us in the industry.

I want to point out the steps which we have taken in this regard. We have
set up a rock burst commission which has identified flaws in the rock
mechanics approach and practices, and problem mines have been identified.
The inspectorate has called on the industry to address the concerns
identified. Audits and inspections have also been stepped up.

The results of investigations into recent mine fires have been widely
distributed, and directives have been issued to the affected mines.
Similarly, lessons arising from investigations of transport and machinery
accidents are publicised and followed up during routine inspections.
[Interjections.] Madam Speaker they are making a noise.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Madam Speaker, in order to speed up the investigation
of mine accidents, the inspectorate has committed itself to completing
major investigations within two months. In future, the extension of these
deadlines will have to be properly motivated. The operations and demands of
tripartite systems of governance and regulations development are under
review, in consultation with the stakeholders, that is labour and business.
These systems will be altered to free up more time for underground
inspections and address capacity problems by both labour and the
inspectors.

To ensure that the standards applied in the South African mining industry
are in line with international standards, research and communications with
other inspection agencies are the first step in the process of developing
regulations. Currently inspectors offer advice and guidance to small-scale
miners from the regional offices. Specific capacity to serve small-scale
miners may, however, be necessary.

The occupational, health and safety needs of small-scale mines will be
formally investigated, documented and evaluated in the course of the
current financial year. I wish to inform the hon Mr Davidson that this is
an area of concern for us and he needs to keep himself abreast of
developments in this area.

The Director of Occupational Health and Hygiene is developing legislation
and guidelines to reduce the personal exposure of workers to occupational
hygienic stresses such as thermal noise-induced hearing loss and exposure
to air-borne pollutants. This should ultimately lead to an improvement in
quality of life and the reduction of compensation claims due to the chronic
effect of past exposures.
Moving further to the area of mine health and safety, following the Cabinet
decision to nationally integrate occupational health and safety, the mine
health and safety inspectors, in conjunction with the Departments of Labour
and Health, are developing a concept document as the first phase of the
implementation process. On completion of the concept document a policy
formulation will be prepared and presented for consideration by Cabinet.

As the Minister stated, nuclear energy in South Africa, as we all know, is
not a big industry, but it plays an important role in our country and
energy sector. Currently it employs approximately 2 700 people and
accounted for forensic earnings of R330 million in the year 2000.

Under the new Act, the Nuclear Energy Act, and the National Nuclear
Regulator Act of 1999 which commenced in February 2000, we are continuing
and endeavouring to transform the nuclear energy industry and to improve
our governance of this technology. Yet we all know that it is sometimes a
controversial industry.

One of the major tasks we are engaged in is the drafting of new
regulations, ie notices of declarations required under the new nuclear
regulations. Although one new regulation has been published in the Gazette
in the year 2000, much work still lies ahead to draft legislation on
matters such as the management and the discarding of radioactive waste and
the radiated nuclear fuels co-operative governance, as well as fees in
respect of nuclear authorisation and the level of financial security
required for nuclear installation and safety standards.

We are currently restructuring the current company Nexur. We are proud to
inform hon members that at this stage we have appointed Ms Louisa Zondi as
the new Chief Executive Officer. We think she has all the competencies and
qualities required for this particular post.

Renewable energy is a technological area which will contribute towards an
energy mix, and it has been recognised that renewables are going to be a
significant energy source for the future. Growing awareness has shown that
the conventional electricity grid will not reach people living in remote
areas. To this end renewable energy technologies are well-suited to
decentralise small-scale electricity generation. Mini high grid systems
will be addressed as an element of the renewable energy strategy. We are
looking at regulation that will provide incentives for renewable energy.

Currently the department is facilitating the development of bulk
electricity generation through wind energy at the Darling wind farm. The
project has been declared a national demonstration project, and the lessons
learned will be used for policy development. As we are aware, South Africa
will be hosting, through the Department of Environmental Affairs and
Tourism, the World Summit on Sustainable Development - which is Rio+10 -
next year. The Department of Minerals and Energy is part of this process.
We are planning to have a major renewable energy exhibition and conference
for energy Ministers.

International pressure, as hon members are aware, is becoming an increasing
reality of global warming. These are some of the major issues that need to
concern us as an energy intensive economy, particularly because of our
dependence on fossil fuel. As the department, we will continue to
strengthen our participation at national, regional and international forums
on the environment. This will ensure the sustainable development of the
South African energy sector, increased investments in clean energy
technologies and compliance with the environment.

An issue of importance to us is HIV/Aids. The mining industry, like any
other industry, is currently affected by this epidemic. A tripartite
committee is soon to be launched to consider ways of addressing the impact
of HIV. The terms of reference of this committee were recently finalised.
Several initiatives have, however, been underway at mines and at regional
level.

Knowledge, awareness and life skills are being addressed in most of these
initiatives, which also include members of the wider community. An example
is the Mpumalanga power belt project, which was initiated by Anglo Gold,
Sasol, Ingwe, Duiker Mines, CSIR, Mintech, Eskom and the department.
Obviously, we need to pool our resources in order to make an impact. No
single agency acting on its own can really make a meaningful and lasting
impact on the issue of Aids.

In conclusion, we would like to emphasise that our key challenge now as a
country is to ensure that the channels provided by the democratic process,
such as Government departments, institutions and other state bodies, will
actually deliver on their commitments. As hon members are aware, all
Government departments are working together to ensure that we are able to
work in an integrated way to address the needs of our people.
[Applause.]

Prof I J MOHAMED: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President, hon Minister, hon
Deputy Minister and hon members, it is a pleasure for me to support the
Vote of the Department of Minerals and Energy.

I wish to pay my respects to the memory of the late Nadia Davids, former
chief director of electricity in the Department of Minerals and Energy, who
passed away in January of this year after a short illness. Nadia was a
student of mine in mathematics while she studied electrical engineering at
the University of the Witwatersrand. She graduated from Wits in 1985 and
later graduated from Warwick University in England with a masters degree in
information technology. We also worked together politically. It is with
sadness that I convey my condolences and that of the portfolio committee to
her family.
We welcome the victory of the Department of Minerals and Energy, in that
State Expenditure has at last zero-rated VAT on paraffin. This is a major
victory for the poor. But - and this is a big but - while the paraffin
price is not regulated, traders will be free to charge whatever they like
and thus wipe out the VAT gain. The department must speedily address this
situation.

On another front, the general public is alarmed at the escalating petrol
price. As long as crude oil is imported at IBLC - that is, In Bond Landed
Cost at dollar prices - we will continue to see this escalation as the rand
value of the dollar increases and fluctuates. The Department of Minerals
and Energy and Government must resolve this problem.

In addition to the above, the department must ensure that the mining sector
develops appropriate technology, to mine at levels going down to 4km
underground. Serious problems of health and safety are posed at these
levels and more dependence will have to be placed on more sophisticated
mechanical and technological methods and health protection measures. The
development of the gas and oil industry requires further human resource
development, and I took note that the Minister has sent people abroad for
training in that direction.

My colleagues will speak on the issues of mining, liquid fuels, alternative
energy resources and gas development and I will, therefore, not touch
further on these. I shall now address the need for a bigger budget for the
Department of Minerals and Energy, the nuclear waste problem and meeting
energy needs in the long term.

The budget of the Department of Minerals and Energy decreased in 1998 by
18,6%, in 1999 by 9% and in 2000 by 1,3%. This year there was a small
increase of 0,34% which, after inflation is taken into account, is a
decrease of the order of 7,5%. Of course, this decrease is mainly due to
the changing role of Necsa, the Nuclear Energy Corporation or the old
Atomic Energy Board. If these are compounded over the period 1998 to 2001,
the Vote shows a decrease of 26,6% which, after taking inflation into
account, is a massive 45,1%.

I understand the fiscal problem that the country faces, but the real
decline of over 45% in four years must have a serious, detrimental effect
on the department. At this rate, how can the capacity be developed to carry
out urgent tasks? I believe this is a problem of many departments.

I would just like to cite, as an example that when I write to some
departments, not the Department of Minerals and Energy, I have to write
letter after letter before I get a reply. I recall, recently, that I stood
in a hospital queue with a ninety-seven year old lady from six o'clock in
the morning until ten o'clock at night. To me, that says: there is a
problem of capacity in various departments.

I am not speaking of the Department of Minerals and Energy in this
connection, but I am trying to highlight, in fact, that when one has
capacity problems, then there are constraints on the budget. This year,
2001-02, there is, in fact, an increase of R621,083 million, of which R600
million is due to the National Electrification Programme reverting back to
the Department of Minerals and Energy, as the Minister has already
indicated. The Department clearly and understandably does not have the
technical capacity for such a massive programme, and so it will commission
Eskom, I understand, to carry out this project and will then exercise
oversight.

I now turn to the problem of nuclear waste, where it is clear that Koeberg
has a storage problem, and the fact that we do not have a high level
nuclear waste facility. A major leakage or meltdown at Koeberg will mean a
monumental disaster for the Western Cape and South Africa. This extremely
dangerous high-level nuclear waste cannot simply be transported across the
length and breadth of the country. Indeed, there is no facility to which it
can be taken and, for that reason, it is stored in ponds at Koeberg.

This is not just a problem for us, but a problem worldwide. It is clear
that technical capacity must be developed to address this difficult
problem. The Department of Minerals and Energy may have to commission
Geoscience to survey the country for a suitable deep-level geological clay
site that must be able to withstand, over a long geological timespan, the
storage of nuclear waste without rupture. Of course, the Department of
Minerals and Energy may, in addition, also get Necsa and the National
Nuclear Regulator to help in that research.

Finally, I want to address, briefly, the problem of future energy sources.
Imported fuel is costly and, as we have noted, with the declining rand, it
will have serious implications for fuel-induced costs to industry and the
economy. It seems fairly clear that the rand will decline at its present
rate and, thus, continue to compound the problem.

It is clear that hydrocarbons must continue to be the main source of energy
for our country. However, there are serious problems of pollution and
global warming, as has already been said by the Minister. Gas and oil that
we can access have a lifespan of some 20 years. This is an important
development, but 20 years is a short period in the economic life of any
country. The quantities are small in comparison with North Sea Gas, but the
problems of hydrocarbons are serious and we have to look at nuclear energy,
provided one can solve the environmental problems of hydrocarbons and the
high level waste problems of nuclear waste.

The department and Cabinet are to be congratulated on having given Eskom
the go-ahead for the environmental assessment study of the PBMR, the Pebble
Bed Modular Reactor, as well as for its technological soundness. When I say
that we must give more money to the Department of Minerals and Energy,
where would this funding come from? Hon members know that the department
has been saddled with loans to the Atomic Energy Corporation, which stems
from the time of the bomb project. Those loans need to be taken over by the
fiscus and the Department of Minerals and Energy must be given its budget

Mr E J LUCAS: Madam Speaker, the Minister of Minerals and Energy and her
department have been facing challenging times. It unfortunately appears
that things could get worse before they get better. I would like to commend
the Minister, however, on the way she handled the CEF issue. The
professionalism and the speed with which she dealt with the issue give us
hope that she and her department will be able to face the challenges ahead.

Allow me to make the following observations: The amount of R1,205 billion
is R621 billion more than the revised budget for the 2000-01 financial
year, which amounted to R603,7 million. The reason for this massive
increase is determined in the White Paper on Energy Policy. The Department
of Minerals and Energy took over the funding of the National
Electrification Programme from Eskom on 1 April 2001. An amount of R600
million is, therefore, included in the Department of Minerals and Energy's
budget, which explains the increase. This addition skews the budget to a
great extent. Without the addition, the budget would have grown nominally.

A matter that needs urgent and honest clarification is whether the
department has the necessary expertise to manage the National
Electrification Programme, which, up to now, has been managed by Eskom. It
is vital that the necessary capacity exists within the department, to
ensure the continued success of the National Electrification Programme. I
am pleased to say that, during the Minister's address, she did touch on
this issue.

The IFP further notes that the Minerals and Energy 2001-02 budget is
comprised of five programmes. It notes that there was an increase of 13,8%
in administration, an increase of 8,4% in promotion of mine safety and
health, and an increase of 24% in mineral development. Energy management
shows an increase of 120%. This perceived dramatic increase is due to the
allocation of the National Electrification Programme, which I have already
made reference to. Without this allocation, however, the energy management
programme would have decreased by 30%.
While the SA Nuclear Energy Corporation has a decrease of 9,9%, the
National Nuclear Regulator receives an increase of 3,5%. Mintec has had a
decrease of 1,45% and the Council for Geoscience receives an increase of
8,3%. If the R600 million budget allocation to the National Electrification
Programme were to be ignored, however, it is worth noting that the Minerals
and Energy budget would have increased by R1,8 million from the previous
financial year. This would translate into an effective increase of 0,3%.

It is the view of the IFP that the Minister and her department must be
applauded for their stance regarding the small-scale mining sector. For
example, in a place like Osizweni in KwaZulu-Natal, people were extracting
coal and clay in extremely dangerous conditions. Now, the miners have been
relocated to a safe area, not far from their homes. This is a good
practical example of how Government can effectively help relieve people of
their heavy burdens.

The plight of the small-scale miner is enormous. Government must take up
the challenge to find more hands-on methods of relief. For the small-scale
miner, it is extremely difficult to enter the industry because it needs
large financial investments. Financial institutions, however, are not
willing to extend financial assistance to them because of the risk factor.

I know that the department is aware of the catch-22 situation that miners
often find themselves trapped in. I hope that a solution can be found in
order to help them. I am sure that the regional minerals and energy
officers can play an important role in finding the solution for that and
other problems that are facing small-scale miners.

The IFP recognises that there has been a decrease in fatal accidents from
12 deaths per 1 000 employees in 1995 to 0,69 deaths per 1¬†000 employees in
the year 2000. It¬†would appear that the safety and health programme is
producing effective results. We encourage further research aimed at
eliminating all potential danger in the working environment.

We cannot ignore that a serious problem still remains with long-standing
mines that are still in very poor condition. The IFP notes that, while
there is always room for improvement in the area of rehabilitation of land
and vegetation, mining companies - generally speaking - are doing a
sterling job. The disposal of nuclear waste is and will remain an important
issue. The people of South Africa will have to be assured and convinced
that the issue of waste disposal has been professionally attended to. It is
our right.

The price of petrol, diesel and paraffin is on the minds of and is felt in
the pockets of all South Africans, including all stakeholders. The
statement by a group of petrol dealers that Government must hand over any
decrease in the fuel price to them was unfortunate in the extreme. The
problem, as we all know, is mainly due to the value of the rand against the
US dollar. The price of crude oil dropped from US$ 30 to an average of US$
27 a barrel. Understandably, the price of fuel increased because of our
weak rand.

The IFP believes that the time has come for the Minister and her department
to consider an alternative pricing formula. Maybe, by so doing, the actual
fuel price would be more realistic. The time has come to investigate and
workshop the fuel price issue in order to produce workable recommendations.
That workshop will need a very inclusive approach which must include the
Department of Finance.

The reality is that our petrol price reflects more than the cost of petrol
itself. It has hidden costs and provisions for other areas such as third
party insurance. We need to realistically address all cost centres and
determine the value of that as opposed to affordable petrol costs. The
workshop will be essential and will give a broad input based on concerned
groups who can give Government insight into the reality and needs of a
sector of society.

The reality of us, as South Africans, is that even with the taxation relief
our basic expenditure on essentials - of which energy is one the most
important - has spiralled out of control. Our daily financial expenditure
will increase and not decrease, even with our taxation relief. As
representatives of the people we, as legislatures, must protect those
sectors of our society that are most vulnerable. This continued spiral is
severely detrimental to the marginalised and impoverished members of our
society.

The IFP believes that the budget of the Department of Minerals and Energy
should be supported as it shows the commitment to fiscal discipline while
continuing the trend of greater emphasis on service delivery. The IFP
supports Vote 29 and will be closely monitoring expenditure trends.
[Applause.]

Ms M M RAMAKABA-LESIEA: Madam Speaker, hon members of Parliament and
colleagues, one of the greatest successes of the Reconstruction and
Development Programme has been the Government's electrification programme.
The RDP set a target of electrifying 2,5 million households by the year
2000 in an attempt to address the enormous backlog that resulted from the
legacy of apartheid. In fact 2,74 million homes were electrified during
that period - 240 000 more than the original target.

According to the National Electricity Regulator, 66% of all households in
South Africa now have electricity. A total of 80% of households in urban
areas have electricity and 46% of households in rural areas also have
electricity. One cannot underestimate the impact of electrification. It is
difficult to appreciate this fully unless one has grown up without it. The
poorest of the poor now have access to electricity. Children and their
parents can now study by electric light which will influence a whole
generation.

Fires caused by paraffin and candles, asthma and pneumonia caused by indoor
smoke, can become a thing of the past thus saving the economy millions of
rands and saving poor communities much suffering. Yet, there is still a
problem. Even though the poorest of the poor have access to electricity,
many cannot afford it. For this reason, I commend the Government's
commitment to provide free electricity to the poor up to 50kw per month.
This will be justified on avoided costs alone. It is estimated that health
care and hospital costs which will be avoided by communities by switching
from paraffin and candles to electricity will go a long way towards paying
for the subsidy.

We must now consider the future. The RDP target has been met. What now?
Everything has changed since the electrification programme began. We
finally have new postapartheid local authorities. The distribution of
electricity, which has long been dominated by local authorities, is being
placed in the hands of six new regional electricity distributors. The
electricity supply industry is being restructured to facilitate
competition. Tariffs, which in 1994 were a tangle of inconsistent and
widely ranging charges and not reflective of the cost of supply, are being
rationalised and pegged to the real price of electricity. All of that is
the outcome of the ANC Government's efforts to achieve a properly regulated
industry which will in turn achieve the goals outlined for the energy
sector by our President in his state of the nation address.

The National Electricity Regulator, which was established in the early days
of the current Government, has become a highly successful institution at
the centre of this process. A competitive market for the supply of
electricity, combined with good regulation practices, will protect the long-
term interests of consumers and the economy. It will also allow easier
access to the industry through new and more efficient technology and new
sources of energy such as gas.

What next in electrification? It is vital that the expertise built up over
the last seven years in electrification should not be lost in the
restructuring process. At the moment, most of that expertise lies with
Eskom. As Eskom is corporatised and restructured we must ask ourselves
where the most appropriate home for this capacity will be. Not only is
there much work to be done here, but these skills will be of benefit to our
neighbours in SADC and the rest of Africa.

The Department of Minerals and Energy is currently undertaking a wide-
ranging study to assess the impact of electrification, particularly on
rural development, before starting the next phase. This is essential.
Electricity is not an end in itself. We need to know what the impact of
electricity is on households and small businesses, and what mechanisms need
to be put in place to make sure that the process is sustainable. Are people
able to make full use of electricity? Are there other mechanisms that need
to be put in place? This is even more true for off-grid electrification.

Since Eskom has become a normal taxpayer, funding for electrification is
now channelled through the fiscus and the programme will be under the
control of the department. That will allow the programme to be more closely
integrated with national energy policy goals and programmes.

Because each connection was cheaper, electrification in the 1990s
concentrated on urban households. As far as household energy is concerned,
the current decade should be the ``decade of rural energisation''.
Technology such as solar panels, minigrids and other small-scale energy
options are ready to be deployed in rural areas where the grid cannot be
extended economically.

Off-grid electricity systems such as solar panels cannot provide for all
the energy needs of such rural households because of lack of power. Other
sources of energy, such as LPG, Liquified Petroleum Gas, need to be
considered for cooking and heating. An innovative scheme based on consensus
is the key to current delivery in remote rural areas. Some of these areas
are being supplied with the solar electricity system and LPG as a package.
It is hoped that infrastructure will be established to maintain these
energy systems, which will also boost rural development through the
creation of small energy business.

Other options, such as biogas and fuel cells need to be explored and
properly researched. The massive potential of energy-efficient housing,
which is a cheap and effective energy option, has not been realised at all
in South Africa. A pilot project in Kimberley has been very successful in
using the housing subsidy to build low-cost energy-efficient houses that
will save the inhabitants millions of rands in heating costs over the next
fifty years as well as the environmental costs of generating extra
electricity or burning extra coal or paraffin. More co-operation across
Government departments is necessary to implement this kind of policy. [Time

Mnr A H NEL: Mnr die Voorsitter, soos ons almal die afgelope twee weke kon
sien, loop daar 'n verskuiwingslyn, of ``fault line'' op Engels, deur die
hart van die ANC en verskyn daar al meer krake in sy mondering.

Die spanning tussen die faksies word al groter en hoe meer lede dit ontken,
hoe opvallender word die verskille. Binne die ANC is hierdie verskille eers
toegesmeer met die ``struggle'' teen apartheid en daarna is kritiek oor
sulke verskille as rassisme afgemaak.

Noudat die kritiek oor die grondliggende spanning wat di√© verskillende
sienings veroorsaak van binne die ANC self kom, word dit besweer deur
sogenaamde komplotte teen die leier van die organisasie te ontdek. Hierdie
foutlyn van verskillende filosofiese benaderings loop ook deur die
ministerie van minerale en energie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr A H NEL: Mr Chairperson, as we could all see during the past two weeks,
there is a fault line running through the heart of the ANC and more and
more cracks are appearing in its facade.

The tension between the factions is increasing and the more members deny
this the more obvious the differences become. Within the ANC these
differences were initially papered over with the struggle against apartheid
and thereafter criticism about such differences was dismissed as racism.

Now that criticism about the underlying tension caused by these different
views is coming from within the ANC itself, it is being averted by
discovering so-called conspiracies against the leader of the organisation.
This fault line of different philosophical approaches also runs through the
Ministry of Minerals and Energy.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, could you take your seat?
Hon member, is that a point of order?

Mnr S K LOUW: Mnr die Voorsitter, met alle respek, die agb lid dwaal
heeltemal van die punt af en pak nie die onderwerp van die portefeulje of
begrotingspos minerale aan nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] [Mr Chairperson, with all
due respect, the hon member is deviating entirely from the point and is not
addressing the topic of the Minerals portfolio or Vote. [Interjections]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, take your seat. [Interjections.]
Hon member, continue with the debate, but stick to the topic before us.

Mnr A H NEL: Ek kan verstaan dat mnr Louw taamlik fyngevoelig daaroor is.

Hierdie foutlyn van verskillende filosofiese benaderings loop ook deur die
ministerie van minerale en energie. Aan die een kant 'n sosialistiese
benadering teenoor die meer markgerigte benadering aan die ander kant.
Hierdie wydsbeenstaan oor, myns insiens, twee onversoenbare stelsels, bring
natuurlik mee dat daar uit twee monde gepraat word en teenstrydighede
ontstaan. Die onsekerheid wat hieruit voortspruit, be√Ønvloed nie net die
bestuur van die departement nie, maar dit is ook die beeld wat na die
beleggers daar buite uitgedra word, en dit in 'n nywerheid soos die mynwese
wat juis sekerheid in eiendomsreg en regulering vereis.

Laat ek 'n paar voorbeelde noem van wat ek s√™. Op 28 Maart het ek aan die
Minister gevra of sy die nuwe wetsontwerp op die ontwikkeling van minerale
na die Konstitusionele Hof gaan verwys. Die antwoord van die Adjunkminister
was dat die ministerie dit nie gaan doen nie, die President kan as hy wil.
Slegs 'n maand vantevore, op 14 Februarie, het die Minister egter ges√™ dat
sy en haar departement die wetgewing na die Konstitusionele Hof sal verwys.
Hierdie stelling van haar is in minstens vier koerante gepubliseer,
duidelik twee verskillende standpunte.

'n Tweede voorbeeld: In 'n pamflet wat deur die departement uitgegee word
om buitelandse beleggers te lok om hier te bel√™, staan daar, en ek haal aan
``mineral rights in South Africa are recognised as rights in land and thus
enjoy constitutional protection''. Op 28 Maart antwoord die Adjunkminister
op 'n opvolgvraag en ek haal aan ``as the hon member knows, in terms of the
Bill of Rights, mineral rights ... are not a fundamental right''.

Die Minister onthou mos nog dat haar departement verlede jaar op dieselfde
vraag oor die Emanuel Shaw-geval twee regstreeks teenstellende antwoorde
verskaf het en dat altwee daardie antwoorde in Hansard onder haar naam
verskyn. Dus is haar amptenare in effek verantwoordelik dat sy die
Parlement mislei het. Sy het verlede jaar aangedui dat sy aandag hieraan
sal gee, maar nog niks het gebeur nie. 'n Departement mag mos nie s√≥
funksioneer nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A H NEL: I can understand that Mr Louw is fairly sensitive about that.

This fault line of different philosophical approaches also runs through the
Ministry of Minerals and Energy. One has a more socialistic approach on the
one hand as opposed to a more market-oriented approach on the other. This
straddling of, in my opinion, two irreconcilable systems naturally means
that two voices are used and contradictions arise. The uncertainty which
arises from this situation not only influences the management of the
department, but is also the image which is conveyed to the investors
outside, and that in an industry such as mining which in fact requires
security of property rights and regulation.
Allow me to mention a few examples of what I am talking about. On 28 March
I asked the Minister whether she was going to refer the new Bill on the
development of minerals to the Constitutional Court. The reply from the
Deputy Minister was that the Ministry was not going to do so, the President
could if he wished. However, only a month before, on 14 February, the
Minister said that she and her department were going to refer the
legislation to the Constitutional Court. This statement of hers was
published in at least four newspapers, clearly two different positions.

A second example: In a pamphlet distributed by the department to attract
foreign investors to invest here, it is stated, and I quote ``mineral
rights in South Africa are recognised as rights in land and thus enjoy
constitutional protection''. On 28 March the Deputy Minister replied as
follows to a follow-up question, and I quote: ``as the hon member knows, in
terms of the Bill of Rights, minerals rights ... are not a fundamental
right''.

The Minister surely still remembers that last year in reply to the same
question on the Emanuel Shaw incident her department supplied two directly
contradictory replies and that both those replies appear under her name in
Hansard. Her officials are therefore in effect responsible for her
misleading Parliament. Last year she indicated that she would give
attention to this matter, but nothing has yet happened. Surely a department
cannot function this way.]

Let me come to something more positive: It is common knowledge that very
large parts of our country will never be serviced by grid electricity, and
this is also where we find the most vulnerable and poor people of our
nation. Therefore, we welcome and commend the work done by the department
on renewable energy.

I have read through the plans and strategies of the department and I want
to agree with the objective to introduce renewable energy as an activator
of rural development. We want to urge the Minister to see to it that
renewable energy sources and the development of rural areas, through
sufficient energy, take a high priority in the integrated energy plan.

The Minister likes talking about the cost-effectiveness of measures. I can
think of nothing more cost effective than money spent on supplying energy
to the rural areas. I truly believe that when people are given the tools,
they will, to a large extent, uplift themselves.

When we talk about renewable energy, we only mention solar, wind and
biomass energy. But there are exciting prospects and projects of new
sources of clean energy out there. Let me name a few: Tidal-wave turbines
in sizes that range from 7,5 megawatts to 15 megawatts; a machine to tap
into electrostatic energy; a hydromagnetic dynamo which can be built to the
size of a thousand megawatts and many others. My request is that the
department should investigate these new methods and sources, and try to
facilitate investment and production in South Africa.

As die Adjunkminister nie weet waar dit is nie, kan ek vir haar die goed
gee dat sy dit kan kry. [Tyd verstreke.] [If the Deputy Minister does not
know where this is, I can provide her with the necessary information, so
that she can find it.]] [Time expired.]]

Mnr S K LOUW: Mnr die Voorsitter, laat my toe om ter aanvang van hierdie
debat onmiddellik te reageer op die snert wat die vorige spreker hier
kwytgeraak het.

'n ABG LID: Kap hom, Sellie, kap hom.

Mnr S K LOUW: Dit is ongegronde inligting, maar dit is hoe die NP nog altyd
funksioneer.

Laat my ook toe om, namens ons portefeuljekomitee ons adjunkdirekteur, dr
Bredell, wat op 30 Junie 2001 met vervroegde pensioen aftree en ons
departement na meer as 30 jaar diens gaan verlaat, voorspoed toe te wens.
Sy bydrae in terme van hervorming en herstrukturering het nie ongesiens
verbygegaan nie. Ons in die portefeuljekomitee en in die departement sal
hom mis, maar wil hom 'n gelukkige en voorspoedige rus toewens. [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr S K LOUW: Mr Chairperson, allow me at the start of this debate to
respond immediately to the nonsense the previous speaker uttered here.

An HON MEMBER: Nail him, Sellie, nail him.

Mr S K LOUW: This information is without foundation, but that is how the NP
has always operated.

Allow me, on behalf of our portfolio committee, to wish our deputy
director, Dr Bredell, who is going on early retirement on 30 June 2001 and
will be leaving our department after more than 30 years of service,
everything of the best. His contributions with regard to transformation and
restructuring did not go unnoticed. We in the portfolio committee and in
the department will miss him, but want to wish him a happy and prosperous
retirement.]

During the President's state of the nation address, clear directives and
indications were set up. What was more clearly displayed was the pivotal
role the Department of Minerals and Energy has to play in steering this
major achievement of our Government, in order to ensure free electricity
for all, promote a competitive market and facilitate a gas trade between
our countries and other countries.

Our Ministry rises above the challenges and demands when they are faced
with issues that were reflected in the President's speech. I want to
commend the Minister, the Deputy Minister, the director-general and his
team for the very good team spirit in terms of their oversight role, as
well as our chairperson, Mr Duma Nkosi, who keeps on pushing to ensure that
the committee remains focused on their mandate.

It is correct to highlight the need and responsibility of the mining
industry to determine the ethical climate in which their business should
operate and for the department to set an appropriate example through moral
leadership and measurement, taking the necessary steps to determine what
the existing climate is within the mining industry and inform the audience,
voters and other role-players about their progress. We will be able to
modernise the mining industry and come up with major transformational
challenges, bearing in mind that mining is a significant contributor to job
creation and rural economic and regional development.

Another important issue is the mine health and safety aspect of the
industry. The tripartite partners approach is having an impact. The summit
which was held recently to review the state of mine health and safety
showed progressive improvements. The fatality and accident rates have
declined significantly. This decline has been faster since 1994.
Previously, it was profits before people; now it is people before profits.
We must also consider that the gold mines remain the main source of
fatalities, and the decline in fatalities in this sector has been less
compared with others in the mining sector.

I want to extend our condolences to the bereaved families of the three
miners at Savuka Gold Mine in Carletonville who died in a rock blast
recently and those who died in a mine blast this morning at Beatrix Mine,
and wish a speedy recovery to those who were injured. The incidents of
accidents and fatalities in the mining industry remain our deep concern,
but we cannot doubt the fact that radical progress has been made towards
addressing these. The statistics for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 showed a
significant decline in the rates of fatalities and injuries. There has been
a reduction in these figures, and I want to commend the department for
taking the lead in this major success.

I would be irresponsible if I did not touch on the silent war that we are
facing in our work and social life, which is the war against HIV/Aids in
the mining industry. Education and awareness campaigns have to be a
continuous programme in our workplaces. The efforts by the unions,
Government and the mining companies have thus far not made significant
progress. They have not succeeded in making a discernible impact on high
risk behaviour. It is believed that the infection rate amongst mineworkers
probably exceeds the average for adults, and may in some workplaces be as
high as one in three.

The recommendation made at the recent tripartite mine health and safety
summit to establish a special committee to address this crisis in the
industry, with funding from the state, is most welcome. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Chairperson, the priorities of the 2001 Main Budget
presented by the Minister of Finance in this honourable House are economic
development, job creation, poverty alleviation, skills development and
ensuring of safety and justice. This Vote augurs well for the goals of the
Main Budget, and the UDM will support this Vote.

The proposed organisational structure of the department, comprising
associated institutions such as the Atomic Energy Corporation, Council for
Nuclear Safety, Mintek, South African Diamond Board, National Electricity
Regulator and the branch and directorate components of the department, is a
step in the right direction and we believe that Government will provide
sufficient funds for the implementation of this organogram.

The UDM recognises and appreciates the initiative taken by the department
in the establishment of the Gold Crisis Committee to address the decline in
the gold mining industry, which was followed by a holistic and integrated
approach to the decline in the mining industry in general and to deal with
the causes of the decline, the limitation of the impact in terms of job
losses, and the reduction of the severity of the consequences of
retrenchments.

We also noted with appreciation a variety of initiatives which involved
Government, the labour movement and the Chamber of Mines, which were
undertaken to counter the decline in the mining industry. The UDM believes,
however, that these positive initiatives should also seek ways and means to
address the continuous escalation in fuel prices which has become a thorn
in the flesh of the nation.

It is common knowledge that the mining industry in South Africa has a
myriad ways which contribute to the wellbeing of the economy. Corporate and
Government bodies that had evolved over many decades in the mining industry
were unacceptable both at home and internationally. Management and
workplace practice in the mining industry were archaic and a relic of the
colonial and apartheid eras. The Department of Minerals and Energy has
succeeded somewhat in modernising and democratising the industry.

The department's estimates that as many as 250 000 new jobs could be
created by the year 2010 through the promotion of a jewellery manufacturing
industry, are encouraging. Much must however be done to avoid job losses.
The mining industry has been shedding jobs for over a decade. Between 1989
and 1998, 325 000 jobs were lost in this sector. It is common knowledge
that most of the job losses in the mining industry were as a result of
restructuring to reduce operating costs.

Go a tsebega gore batho baso ba lefase le ba dikile ba gamiswa dikgomo
eupsa maswi a tsona ba sa je. Ba dikile ba episwa mahumo a ka tlase ga
naga, gomme ba solelwa maamuso a ditsweletswa ao ka ntlhana ya lehwana.
(Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[It is a well-known fact that our people had to milk cows and that they
were not allowed to drink that milk. They had to dig out wealth
underground, yet they were paid very meagre salaries.]

South Africa is a major exporter of processed minerals, mainly to Europe,
North and Central America, and the Pacific Rim countries. It is hoped that
the mineral development and beneficiation branch will facilitate the
beneficiation of raw minerals or materials within the country, thereby
creating more job opportunities for the people. However, the UDM wishes to
propose, in view of the new Bill on mineral development, that the
Government's policies should continue to attract mining investment. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Ms E NGALEKA: Chairperson, Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka and hon members,
allow me to focus my debate on women in mining. I quote:


  No female shall work underground in a mine and no person shall cause or
  permit any such female so to work, except a female in a management
  position not performing manual work, a female employed in a health and
  welfare position, a female who, in the course of study has to spend a
  period of time underground for training or research purposes, a female
  who has to occasionally go underground for the purposes of a nonmanual
  occupation ...

The above was one of many of the NP's discriminatory apartheid laws that
kept certain women out of the economy of this country, ensuring that these
women suffered a triple oppression. Section 22 of the Bill of Rights states
that every citizen has the right to choose their trade, occupation or
profession freely. Therefore our central goal is to address economic
imbalances and structural programmes in industry, mining and labour
markets.

Culture often gives men the role of head of the family, and women the role
of mother and wife. This distinction leads to a division of labour that is
based on gender.

Women play an important but largely unrecognised or unrewarded role in
mining. A few women are permit holders and entrepreneurs in a few
countries. There are more who are members of co-operatives or less formal
groups, but the vast majority do unskilled, menial work, particularly in
mineral processing or providing goods and services to mines and mining
communities.

While some women receive equal payment when they do the same job as men,
the fact that certain jobs are prescribed or seem to be restricted to women
means that women commonly earn less than men. In some cases, however, women
have demonstrated a certain advantage that they can exploit, for example,
when it comes to more delicate tasks such as panning.

Cecilia Nkambule said:


  Women must not be content to remain in the shadows of their husbands.
  They must venture into jobs that have up to now been reserved for men. We
  are just as capable as men.

Also, mainly in Africa, women have been able to breach the barriers of
tradition to become the owners of mining titles. Areas in which women can
be disadvantaged is in how and how much they are paid for their mining
activities. When the work is carried out in a family context, women have
little or no access to, or control over, financial matters.

The Unifem study found that only 6% of women miners have been able to
obtain a loan to invest in their mining operations, largely due to a lack
of collateral and the negative attitude of bankers towards women in
business. As a result, women miners rely heavily on personal savings and
family contributions for funds.

Women miners do not have a professional mining background, even though
several of them have extensive experience in running businesses of other
types. Their lack of mining skills often makes it difficult for them to run
an efficient mining operation. Training courses and the provision of
technical advice and assistance geared specifically to women's needs and
circumstances are needed. [Interjections.]

A beginning has been made, and the private sector needs to meet Government
half way to ensure that growth in the mining sector is sustainable. The ANC
supports this Vote. [Applause.]

Mr J P I BLANCH√â: Mr Chairperson, we were informed at a portfolio committee
meeting briefing that 19% of this budget would be expended on the
department. The rest will apparently be transferred to associated
institutions. That, we believe, is totally inadequate to implement the
policies and the functions which this Ministry must perform.

Having only five mining environmental inspectors in Gauteng's Witwatersrand
region may be the reason why the Minister is fed with replies to questions
in Parliament that can be construed as ambiguous, evasive and not
transparent. I want to explain why I am saying this. During the past six
years, we have experienced mining companies neglecting their
responsibilities to rehabilitate the environment in which they operate, and
freely allowing squatters onto their properties, whom the local authorities
cannot afford to provide with infrastructure, services or energy.

Because of this, minerals and energy is placing a financial and service
burden on local authorities in Gauteng which they are not geared for, and
which residents cannot afford. Where local authorities could have
developed, they now cannot do so because, stretching right from Germiston
up to Springs, along the mining belt, no development can take place because
the mines have vacated that land.

Despite the fact that various Witwatersrand communities have petitioned the
local authorities, MEC Metcalfe, the department and our Minister to attend
to the dust emission from unrehabilitated mine dumps, the problem has not
been solved. Instead, the taxpayer will now have to pay for the legal
action the Legal Resource Centre is taking against the department and 15
mines for not applying the mineral and energy laws.

I want to provide the facts regarding the other accusations that I am
making. On 16 March, I asked the Minister whether there are any open mine
shafts on the East Rand, to which the Minister replied: ``No.'' I asked a
follow-up question whether deaths or injuries have been caused by such open
mine shafts, and the Minister's reply was:


  No. However, an old steeply inclined shaft situated in the informal
  settlement on the ERPM mining area slumped, leaving a hole 25m deep. A
  resident fell into this hole towards the end of 2000, and subsequently
  died. The hole has since been filled.
In this reply, the Minister contradicts herself more than once. She first
says, ``No, there are no abandoned shafts'' and then she says that there is
one. Then she says that there were no deaths, and, in the same breath,
admits that somebody fell down a hole and died. By referring to it as a
hole, the department wants us to believe that it was dug with pick and
shovel. The Minister says that the hole was 25m deep. The firemen who did
the rescue work said it was 45m deep. Twenty-five metres is as deep as this
building. That is not a hole. A hole is the kind of thing one finds on the
roads since the ANC has been governing South Africa.

I have more bad news for the Minister. Not one but three people have fallen
down shafts in the Boksburg and Germiston area, and two of them have died.
[Laughter.] There they are, sitting and laughing about it. [Interjections.]
I could take her to at least eight open shafts in the area of Primrose,
Geldenhuys, Germiston and Boksburg - eight open shafts which have not been
covered as the law requires them to be. [Interjections.]

In her reply, the Minister also referred to the informal settlement on the
ERPM mining land, which shows that she admits that her department does not
take steps to prevent the settlement of poverty-stricken communities on
dangerous mining ground. They allow this to happen and when people get
killed, they blame apartheid for the tragedy. [Interjections.]

I have further questions for the Minister. Firstly, why did she allow the
Enderbrooke Mining Company to take over the ERPM mine under the existing
mining permit which allows the new owner to continue mining under the
outdated regulations? Had she insisted that Enderbrooke Mining apply for
the new mining licence, they would not have been able to get it and then
they would not have been able to continue with it because they would be
doing illegal mining.

Secondly, why did she not insist that South Africans be employed at that
mine, situated as it is in a region where 25 000 black South Africans are
unemployed? Why did she allow migrant labour from Mozambique to be employed
at the Enderbrooke Mine? [Interjections.] Why continue bringing migrants to
Johannesburg? Why continue doing that? [Interjections.] I would very much
like to help the Mozambicans but let us teach them to farm, not to work on
outdated mines. [Interjections.]
Lastly, why did she allow a R3 million rehabilitation fund to rehabilitate
the ERPM mine dumps to be depleted with a process that failed to stop the
dust emission from the dumps, whilst several companies had offered other
products that could do so?

I cannot come to any other conclusion than that this department has not
been transformed. [Interjections.] [Time expired.]

Mr G G OLIPHANT: Mr Chairperson, despite what the prophets of doom have to
say about the department, this debate today takes place at a time when the
Department of Minerals and Energy is stronger than ever before, and ready
to tackle the challenges of the 21st century, the African century.

I therefore wish to take this opportunity to commend the hon Minister,
Comrade Phumzile, the Deputy Minister, and the staff of the department for
the sterling work done. The Mineral Economics Directorate has published a
very useful profile of the minerals industry which should enrich our
planning in mineral exploitation.

The minerals industry has been active in South Africa for more than a
century and still remains a well-established and resourceful sector of our
economy. Our country is well-positioned to compete globally with a strong
geological endowment, a high degree of technical expertise, a strong
knowledge base, mining services, and a committed and organised workforce
under the visionary leadership of the National Union of Mineworkers.

According to a study conducted by the Graduate School of Business at the
University of Cape Town, South African reserves of key minerals are some of
the most extensive in the world. South Africa is also a leading producer of
many of these minerals, including manganese, chrome, vanadium, platinum
group metals, gold, and titanium minerals.

However, we regret the fact that the socioeconomic conditions of the
majority of mineworkers have not changed for the better. They remain at the
receiving end of the downscaling in the mining industry, owing to
retrenchments and mine closures. They are the most affected by the
dangerous conditions associated with this industry, and become victims of
mine accidents.

The sad news of the mine accident at Beatrix mine in the Free State
confirms this state of affairs and what we should expect any time, any day,
in these mines. The ANC wishes to take this opportunity to extend their
condolences to the family and friends of the deceased.

The hon Mr Blanch√© came here to talk about the dangers associated with what
has happened in the mines that have closed and things like that. He went on
to attack the Minister on these issues, but did not say anything about the
diggers of those holes, those who mined before and left behind danger in
those areas. The low wages received by mineworkers, who constitute an
important part of the industry, also leaves much to be desired, despite the
fact that this is a R500 billion industry.

The scourge of the HIV/Aids pandemic prevalent in the mines, owing to the
problems of the migrant labour system and associated problems, needs to be
addressed urgently. The mineworkers are the ones who are left to die in the
rural areas and neighbouring countries after they have served the South
African mines with dedication and commitment. This sad state of affairs
calls for the Government, the mining cluster and organised labour to work
together more closely to correct the unfortunate image the mining industry
in South Africa has created for itself.

We are very encouraged by the outcome of the mining summit held in February
2000. The stakeholders in this industry produced a consensus report, which
attempts to address most of the problems raised above. We need committed
implementation teams to support the work of the five-a-side committee and
to take forward the work of the summit.

The Bill on mineral development released by the department for public
comment is most timely, and seeks to address the challenges of this
century. In this regard, the Freedom Charter is very instructive, in that
it states, and I quote:


  The national wealth of our country, the heritage of South Africans, shall
  be restored to the people. The mineral wealth beneath the soil shall be
  transferred to the people as a whole.

We cannot fail to realise the implementation of this historic mandate.

In their strategic plan for 2001 to 2004, the Department of Minerals and
Energy recognised that sustainable economic development and enviromental
management would only be fully attained if the general population
participated meaningfully in the economy. The department has therefore
identified access to ownership and management of the mining industry, by
historically marginalised individuals and communities, as a key strategy in
improving the quality of life of all South Africans.

We must aim to have an industry which is no longer exclusive. We must aim
to significantly increase black ownership of mines and significant
participation in management in order to facilitate the participation of
women at all levels in the industry and to ensure that local communities
benefit.

Small-scale miners need to be supported and should not remain small
forever. The big mining companies, therefore, and the Government have a
responsibility to support black economic empowerment initiatives
financially, legislatively and in the human resource development
programmes.

The latest Breakwater Monitor report on demographic trends in the workplace
reveals that over 90% of the management in the mining industry consists of
white males, which indicates a dire need for affirmative action in this
sector. One might ask why this state of affairs persists seven years after
the demise of apartheid. Let us today celebrate our democratic Constitution
with the resolve to realise the economic ideals of our noble Constitution.

I see that my time has expired, so, in conclusion, I wish to say the same
applies to the petrochemical industry. I wish to thank my colleagues in the
portfolio committee and the committee section for the support they gave to
the committee. The ANC supports this Vote. We also have an obligation to
take along the DA, screaming and kicking, to support this Vote too.

[Ms N V CINDI: Chairperson, Ministers, leaders and our visitors, we visited
our provinces to see the small mines that our people are mining. We found
that our people were encountering problems in their efforts to create jobs.

We discovered that our people use wheelbarrows and chemicals which are not
good for their health. Our people were doing their own excavation as they
have mining experience. In KwaZulu-Natal they are engaged in job creation,
so that Government projects should supplement what they are doing.

Some of them, including the people of the North West, even though we did
not go to them - in the areas of Schweitzer-Reneke, Wolmaranstad and
Boskuil, where I come from - are still earning R50 per week. They are still
oppressed, but the committee, which is led by two powerful women, will
bring about changes.

At Barberton, in KwaZulu-Natal, women mine coal using their bare hands.
They also dig out the clay that is used to make bricks. These things do
happen.]

If properly regulated and supported, small-scale mining has many
advantages. Unlike large-scale mining, employment and profits usually
accrue to local communities. An emphasis on beneficiation could lead to a
proliferation of secondary enterprises.

Many small-scale miners are engaged in activities that could more
accurately be described as processing of materials than mining, such as the
collection of scrap metal from old mining sites. If the scope of small-
scale mining was extended to this kind of activity, the same kind of
enterprise could thrive in urban areas. Small-scale mining ranges in size
from micro enterprises employing up to five people, to medium-sized
businesses employing up to 300 people.

What can Government do and what is Government doing to support and promote
this activity? Our President, in his state of the nation address, spoke of
giving priority to integrated rural development. Developing small-scale
mining should be a key part of this vision.

Historically, small-scale mining has not been encouraged in South Africa,
both by a hostile legal framework and by a market structure that favoured
only big players. One of the biggest problems faced by small-scale miners
is finance. There are two aspects to this. The first is capital needed for
prospecting and the process of licensing, and the second is financing of
mining equipment. Another significant problem is mineral rights. The
current system of mineral rights in South Africa allows large mining houses
to control extensive mineral rights to resources that they do not plan to
exploit.

The other four chief problems that face the sector are health and safety,
environmental concerns, wage levels and marketing. Innovative ways need to
be found to promote the same standard of health and safety at small-scale
mines and mines which exist in other parts of the mining industry. The same
applies to environmental concerns and working conditions. If it is to
contribute positively to development, small-scale mining needs to be
brought inside the law.

Marketing is another problem, especially with bulk material, such as
kaolin, which poses unique transport problems. The obvious solution is
local beneficiation, which would need to be part of the broader development
strategy in the region. To this end, a number of initiatives are being put
in place by Government.

The Department of Minerals and Energy is developing a national small-scale
mining development framework to provide support to small-scale miners
through the national steering committee of service providers of the small-
scale mining sector and a number of regional small-scale mining committees,
on which a number of institutions are represented, including Government
departments and associated institutions. The aim of the regional committee
is to explore the problems faced or created by small-scale mining in each
province and identify ways in which these can be solved, including
provision of technical advice, the investigation of various financing
options and the provision of training.

The new Bill on material development promises to create unprecedented
access to mineral resources for small-scale miners, and the department aims
to provide ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr B G BELL: Chairperson, Deputy Minister, fellow members of Parliament and
guests, it is my privilege to speak on behalf of the DP and the DA in this
budget debate. There are three aspects I will speak to, that is budget
allocation, electricity restructuring and the mines inspectorate.

Regarding budget allocation, when analysing the budget for this portfolio
we found that the amount has decreased each year and is now inadequate to
fulfil the tasks given. The generation of electricity is the most important
factor that drives our economy. Without this energy we will be living in
the dark ages. The mining industry has been the backbone of the development
of our country. Coal mining, from which 80% of our electrical energy is
generated and from which the major portion of our local liquid fuel
production is gained, gold mining, precious metals, platinum, palladium,
etc, diamond mining and base metal mining, are all important in their own
right and need a strong department to set the scene and make sound policy
decisions.

In the liquid fuel industry, oil, gas, petrol, diesel, paraffin and oil
from coal and gas are all vitally important to all persons and all
industries. It is extremely important that policies and regulations that
set a healthy climate in which these sectors can operate are in place.

Finally, the budget allocation to associated services - the research and
development section - has been reduced every year since the 1997-98 budget
year, and as a result we as a nation are legging behind in research and
development. When we say that only R600 million is needed to regulate,
monitor and develop these highly important sections of our economy, we are
stunned, and would find it extremely difficult to support a budget that we
know is inadequate to do the job.

When we talk of electricity restructuring, the White Paper on Energy Policy
outlining future plans was produced four years ago, and was a good idea.
But, unfortunately, it has as yet not been properly implemented. When
enquiries are made as to the integrated energy plan, which is an integral
part of that White Paper, we are told that due to a lack of manpower, this
document is still not complete. This illustrates to all the inadequacy of
the budget. Yet we find that some movement is being made towards
implementation of what would be a major plan. We appeal to the Minister to
please complete the integrated energy plan now, so that we can have a plan
on the table to work towards.

When we talk of the mines inspectorate, last year I made an appeal not to
allow the mines inspectorate to be attached to the Department of Labour. I
am encouraged that this has not yet materialised. The Minister has
intimated that besides safety and health, the inspectorate will take on
some energy matters.

In conclusion, the DP/DA appeals to the Minister to ensure that we have
some major progress by completing the integrated energy plan, sorting out
the SA Diamond Board, seeing some progress in re-regulating the liquid fuel
industry, making some decisions on the future of nuclear energy and
doubling the money allocated to research and development. [Applause.]

Mr J H NASH: Chairperson, I am really tempted to answer Mr Blanch√©. His
government created those mine dumps. His government placed nonwhites next
to those mine dumps, not a single white person lives next to a mine dump.
[Interjections]

Change is on the horizon as the budget of the Ministry and the Department
of Minerals and Energy indicates. This budget increasingly reflects the
Government's prioritising of transformation, minus the liability inherited
from the apartheid era. The budget has shifted resources towards the
previously marginalised. However, further change needs to occur to ensure
delivery to the ordinary South Africans who were excluded and marginalised
by apartheid.

The least amount of change has come from the hydrocarbon branch. The oil
industry has seen virtually no changes towards transformation since the
ushering in of the democratic transition. [Interjections]. In fact,
premiums in the form of a pricing formula, namely the notorious IBLC and
the import parity formula, are still being paid on the basis of the
apartheid formula. [Interjections.] Though this formula has no bearing on
the current international standards and local economic development goals of
ensuring that liquid fuel products reach the consumer at the cheapest
possible price, international benchmarking of these formulas has still not
occurred. There is a need to change dramatically in order to bring relief
to our people who cry out daily for relief.

The country's pricing formula, commonly known as the IBLC, is a sanctions-
busting apartheid formula, which was designed to overreward the oil
companies for their support of the apartheid regime. The formula is
designed to increase the price of refined products in the domestic market
and does not make the economy internationally competitive. International
factors such as the rand-dollar exchange rate, and the price of crude oil
and refined products, certainly play a role in increasing the local price
of refined products. However, locally refined products are put to bed in
the local market not at the cheapest import alternative but at the
apartheid regime based formula, the IBLC.

An HON MEMBER: Why do you not change this?

Mr J H NASH: The ratio between the spot and posted prices is not in line
with international best practice and must change. I am reliably told that
there is currently more than $100 million worth of fat on the formula which
could be ploughed back into the economy if the pricing formula were
changed.

Mr T D LEE: Why do you not do it?

Mr J H NASH: This is $100 million of fat. This is what they have been
benefiting from all this time. The formula must now change to the cheapest
import alternative. Relief for the urban poor and rural communities can and
must happen. Apartheid premiums that were brought in by the past regime
must be stopped.

In this country paraffin for the poor is priced not at the IBLC but at the
same price as jet fuel. Fuel for the poor cannot be priced in the same way
as fuel for the privileged. Two years ago the 50 litre drum of paraffin was
deregulated by the Department of Minerals and Energy to the advantage of
oil companies and to the detriment of the poorest of the poor. I am still
waiting for an answer as to why this was done.

We are normally told by the oil industry that deregulation would result in
cheaper prices. Even though paraffin is a noncontrolled product, it is
still priced at the IBLC price of jet fuel and has increased considerably
in price since its deregulation. The hon member Davidson should listen. His
pleas for deregulation are not going to help him at all. There is a need
for the Department of Minerals and Energy to regulate paraffin in order to
bring relief to the poor. It should be delinked from the price of jet fuel.

Over the next ten years natural gas will become an important energy carrier
bringing much-needed energy for economic development especially in rural
areas. Proper regulation of this industry is necessary if we are not to
repeat the trajectory of the liquid fuels industry. Natural gas can
certainly not be priced on the current IBLC formula which was brought into
being by members on my left, otherwise the country will develop the same
high price and super profit syndrome as that which prevailed with other
liquid fuel products. It is unclear how the industry makes provision for
black economic empowerment in the sector. The department needs to pursue
this issue vigorously.

I want to inform the hon the Minister that gas can certainly not be priced
into the market at IBLC. There is a situation where there is a potential
for oversupply when the gas fields come on stream. However, it is important
for this House to note that there are two important problems with IBLC in
relation to the pricing of liquid petroleum gas.

Firstly, the IBLC pricing formula for liquid petroleum gas is only R10 per
ton less than the petrol price. This is tantamount to supplying petrol for
domestic use. Yet liquid petroleum gas is a byproduct of the refining
process. No refiner would refine merely to produce a higher volume of
liquid petroleum gas. Secondly, import parity pricing of liquid petroleum
gas is in relation to Kentucky in the USA and this artificially inflates
the transport element in the price for liquid petroleum gas.
[Interjections.]

This hon Minister is not acceptable in the context of attempting to create
a better life for all. It is imperative that people are educated on the
benefits of using liquid petroleum gas, as this would considerably relieve
consumers of the use of paraffin.

South Africa has for far too long developed a culture of passing price
increases purely to the consumer, without creating industry efficiency.
[Applause.]

Mnu D M NKOSI: Sihlalo neNdlu ehloniphekile, siyabonga kuNgqongqoshe
nePhini lakhe. Mangibonge kuMnu uNogxina, onguMqondisi-Jikelele, nakubo
bonke abasebenzi bomkhandlu wezimbiwa nezamandla. Ngicela ukuthi
siqhubekele phambili ngokubambisana nekomidi.

Uhlelo lwekomidi luzosiza ngokuthi, okokuqala, sibonisane ngenqubekela-
phambili ezakhiweni zokusetshenziswa kwezimbiwa nazo zonke izinhlangano
ezisebenzelana noNgqongqoshe kanye noMnyango ezibizwa ngokuthi, phecelezi,
ama-associated institutions. Okwesibili, kudingeka sivumelane ngomthetho
wokwakha isimo sokusebenzisa amandla ezimbiwa eziphathelene nalokho
okuthiwa, phecelezi, yi-liquid petroleum gas njengoba kukhona
uMthethosivivinywa weGesi ophambi kwekomidi njengamanje.

Amazwe afana noNamibia kanye neMozambique kufanele sibambisane nawo
ekwakheni umnotho. Izwekazi le-Afrika kufanele ukuthi silakhe kabusha.
Abahlali basemazweni afana noMozambique kubalulekile ukuthi babonakale
bengabantu abayizakhamuzi nomakhelwane, hhayi kuthiwe bangamakwerekwere
noma amakirimane. Sizovakashela eMozambique nabakwa-Sasol siyikomidi ukuze
siyobona umsebenzi wokuletha izimbiwa zamandla noma igesi lapha eNingizimu
Afrika.

UMthethosivivinywa wokuThuthukiswa kwezeziMbiwa obuye ubizwe nge-Minerals
Development Bill, abanye abakwazi ukuwufunda kahle. Ngicela ukuthi
kengiwachazale kancane amalungu. Siyakwesekela ukuthi lawo malungelo
angasetshenziswa yizinkampani ezinkulu mawadluliselwe kuHulumeni khona lezi
zinkampani ezincane zabamnyama zizokwazi ukuba namalungelo.

Abesifazane kufanele banikwe ithuba lokuthuthukisa umnotho ngezimbiwa.
Abasebenzi bezimayini mabanikwe amakhono okwenza ngcono izinga lomkhiqizo
wabo. Izindawo zasemaphandleni maziphuculwe khona izimpilo zabantu zizoba
ngcono. Sizocela uNgqongqoshe noMnyango ukuthi basiphe inqubekela-phambili
ngohlelo lokusiza abamnyama abasafufusa abasebenza ngezimbiwa, ikakhulukazi
ngezingxenye ezimbili okuyiBakopong Initiative kanye ne-National Small-
Scale Mining Development Framework.

Ngifuna ukwengezelela kulokho okushiwo ngoProfesa Mohamed, njengoba kade
ekhuluma lapha, mayelana nokuzwelana nomndeni nezihlobo zomsebenzi wegatsha
lezimbiwa namandla uNksz Nadia Davids osishiyile. Okunye, ngifaka elami
igama ukuzwelana nabasebenzi abadilikelwe umgodi njengoba esebikile
uNgqongqoshe. Ngicela ukuthi uNgqongqoshe aqhubeke nokuphenya nokuzama
ukunqanda izingozi emigodini yezimayini.

Empini yomzabalazo wenkululeko yezwe lakithi abantu abasishiya bangaphansi
ngenani kunalabo abasishiya ekusebenzeni emigodini. Izimayini zikhule
zathuthuka kakhulu ngezithukuthuku negazi labantu balapha eNingizimu
Afrika. Ziyaqhubeka izinkampani ezifana nawo-De Beers futhi siyaziqhenya
ngazo. Kodwa-ke kunemibuzo esinayo. Ngizobuza kuNgqongqoshe yena-ke uzozama
ukuthi edlulise. Ngoba baningi abantu abangafundanga lapha abangasazi
isiZulu, ngizozama ukuthi ngibasize - ngoba lokhu engizokusho kubalulekile
kakhulu - ngibachazele ngesiNgisi. [Uhleko.] (Translation of Zulu
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr D M NKOSI: Chairperson and honourable House, I would like to thank the
hon the Minister and her deputy for what they have done. My words of thanks
also go to Mr Nogxina, the Director-General of the Department of Minerals
and Energy, and to all employees of this department. I would like us to
continue working together with the Portfolio Committee on Minerals and
Energy.

Firstly, the committee's plan will assist us in discussing the way forward
as regards the structures used in mining and by other organisations that
are working together with the hon the Minister. She is working with
institutions known as associated institutions. Secondly, we should agree on
the law that will help in creating a situation in which we can use minerals
and other things like liquid petroleum gas, as we have a Bill on gas in
front of us.

We should co-operate with countries like Namibia and Mozambique in building
our economy. We should rebuild Africa. It is important that we should
regard people from other countries, like Mozambique, as neighbours. We
should not call them ``kwerekweres'' or ``kirimanes''. Sasol and we as a
committee will visit Mozambique to explore the possibility of bringing
minerals or electricity to South Africa.

Some people cannot understand the name of the Bill concerning developing
minerals, the Minerals Development Bill. Let me explain this to hon
members. We support the idea that the rights that are not used by big
companies should be transferred to the Government so that the small black
companies will be able to have rights.

Women should be given opportunities to develop the mineral economy. Mine
workers should be skilled so that they will improve the level of their
economy. Rural areas should be developed so that people's lives will
improve. We would like the hon the Minister and the department to give us a
way forward regarding the plan to help new black miners, especially in the
two areas of the Bakopong Initiative and the National Small-Scale Mining
Development Framework.

I would like to associate myself with what Prof Mohamed said when he was
expressing words of sympathy to the family and relatives of Ms Nadia
Davids, who was an employee of a certain mining company, and who recently
died. I would also like to convey my sympathy to those workers who were
involved in the mining accident, as the hon the Minister explained. I would
like to encourage the hon the Minister to continue investigating the causes
of these accidents that are taking place in the mining industry.

During the struggle for freedom in our country, the people who died were
half those who died in the mines. The mining industry flourished on the
blood of the people of South Africa. Companies like De Beers continue to
grow and we are proud of them. However, we have some questions that are
reserved. I will ask the hon the Minister and she will pass on the message.
Since there are people in this house who cannot understand Zulu, I will try
and help them. I am doing it, because what I am going to say is very
important. I should explain to them in English. [Laughter.]]

Regarding the De Beers transaction to delist from the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange, I understand that the country will benefit in terms of capital
injection. But what will be the capital outflow in the long run?

Umbuzo lowo engifuna ukuthi angisize ngawo uNgqongqoshe. [This is the
question that I would like the hon the Minister to answer.]

Secondly, we will request that the Minister give us the detailed analysis
informing us of the Government's decision to support the transaction. I am
sure that the Ministry will, in collaboration with other Ministries and
departments, support the request.

In the same vein, the committee will need more information on
interdepartmental cluster programmes and international binational
agreements or programmes, because it affects the capacity of departments,
particularly our department, Minerals and Energy.

There are just too many issues and the challenges are huge. Balancing
policy and budget will be one issue, prioritisation of programmes will be
another. Overloading and underperforming officials of the department will
be the other critical issues, when we look at the budget.

Ukuvala, angibonise lokhu. Umsebenzi mningi. Njengoba umningi umsebenzi,
ugesi uyafuneka emalokishini. Okunye, amafutha noma uphethroli, kanye
namafutha esibani noma uphalafani, kuyaluma esikhwameni.

Ngizocela-ke ukuthi iNdlu ingivumele ukuthi ngisisekele isabiwomali
soMnyango weziMbiwa namaNdla. Ngicela ukuthi udadewethu noma umama
uMaMlambo, asibophele phezulu isiketi ngoba umsebenzi sengathi mningi.
[Uhleko.] [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Let me conclude by mentioning that we still have a lot of work to do.
Similarly, electricity is needed in townships. Things like oil, petrol and
paraffin are too expensive.

I would like the House to allow me to support the budget of the Department
of Minerals and Energy. I would like my sister Mlambo to pull up her socks
because we still have a lot of work to do. [Laughter.] [Applause.]]

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Mphathisihlalo, angiyazi-ke le ndaba
yesiketi - yesigqebhezana. [Uhleko.] [Chairperson, I do not know much about
the issue of a skirt or a short skirt. [Laughter.]]

Just before I comment on some of the questions raised by hon members, I
just want to make sure that I also thank the team that I work with in the
department, which is here in full force, scattered among the Foreign
Affairs people, as well as the CEOs of the institutions that we work with,
ie CEF, NER and NECSA, who are extremely supportive; also, the stakeholders
from the industry, the Black Empowerment community and the NGOs, who are
all here with us today. They continue to be a source of strength, challenge
and sometimes very difficult engagement, but I think all of them are a
necessary combination that makes our work very exciting and meaningful.
They should please keep it up.

Kodwa-ke, balume baphephethe. [But, they should stop their deception, they
are hurting us.]

They should not hit us too much. I would just like to highlight and express
appreciation for the kind of work that they do in the committee and for
their frankness, including the members of the opposition actually, who,
under the leadership of Duma, are always able to play a relatively
constructive role. They should please keep it up. They may just be on their
way to get to the right place, across. [Laughter.]

Hon member Davidson, who used a lot of anecdotes and tried to spin them
around and turn them into facts, I just, as Duma said, want to educate him,
because he does not know Zulu, so it means he is not educated. [Laughter.]
He needs capacity building for Zulu and for a general understanding of what
is happening in South Africa.

He raised the issue of the lack of progress in relation to electricity
reform. Cabinet has adopted a policy on the electricity supply industry.
Cabinet has also adopted a policy on the electricity distribution industry
and we are about to establish a holding company for the purpose of the
restructuring process in the distribution sector, so I am not so sure what
this indecision is that he is talking about.
We are dealing with an extremely important and big industry. The generation
capacity in electricity is between R80 billion and R150 billion,
transmission is between R10 billion and R15 billion and distribution is
between R20 billion and R30 billion. Asingomandongomane la. [This is not
peanuts.]

Mr I O DAVIDSON: What has happened to the report now?

The MINISTER: We are implementing it. That is what I am telling you.

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Has Cabinet rejected it?

The MINISTER: Cabinet did not reject it. The hon member's spy - whoever he
or she is, and however the hon member got that information from - gave him
wrong information. Cabinet never rejected it. It advised us on the areas
that need strengthening, and we are continuing with the work as we
strengthen the report.

In the process the review panel brought in other international expertise,
which has enhanced the report. They continue to fraternise with us as the
implementation unfolds. So, we will meet the deadline. There is no crisis.

Mr I O DAVIDSON: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER: Now, something is happening. You are one of those people who
say if they were not there, the event did not happen. It is happening
without you, because you are not governing. That is why you do not know.
[Applause.]

The hon member also raised anecdotal points based on some gossip that he
might have picked up, about what I said and what letter I received from the
chamber. I will not even deign to reply to that gossip that he is trying to
turn into a fact here, about how I should have consulted the chamber, just
one stakeholder, single them out and concur to write the policy with them
to the exclusion of everybody else. I do not know what that is all about.
So I am not interested in answering that, I can just tell him.

So, by and large, I just find the hon member's comments unhelpful, but I
will grant him one thing: I think that on the integrated plan, we are in
the wrong. We should have done much more by now as far as that is
concerned. The kind of restructuring, however, that we have been doing in
the electricity sector or, for that matter, in any other area of the energy
sector, has not been through thumb sucking.

At the time when the White Paper was developed, a lot of information was
generated, which continues to provide us with the reservoir of information
which we draw from to make some of the decisions that we are making.
However, I agree that that does not replace the importance of the IEP. I
promise the different members who have raised that issue that that is also
a priority. I am just as concerned as they are about that aspect.

On the issue of progress in other areas that was raised and the fact that
there is indecision, I actually think that in my department there are too
many decisions that we are taking. We do not have a problem of teetering
and not taking any decisions.

In terms of gas, we are far ahead of schedule on the things that we have
committed ourselves to do. In the areas where we have not moved, it is
because we just cannot jump to stage three when we have not moved to stage
two. So, I am really not worried about that.

In relation to nuclear energy, we have a policy. It is on our website. In
case the hon member does not know it, it is www.dme.gov.za. The hon member
will see that there is progress. In addition to that, we have actually
developed regulations. The regulations that we committed ourselves to when
we passed the two nuclear energy Bills are there. They will be coming to
the members in due course. There is no problem of indecision there.

Regarding the other point that the member raised, ie that we are changing,
I would like to say that we are not changing. The hon member should read my
lips. The principles of the Minerals Bill will stay as they are. We are,
however, discussing with the chamber and interested parties as to how best
to implement this Bill in such a way that there are no unintended
consequences. As far as that is concerned, we are committed to making sure
that we have the best possible mechanism to implement the Bill in such a
way that we do not in any way disrupt and inconvenience the industry.

We remain very committed to black economic empowerment. In fact, when we
look at the different companies that we believe must benefit, there is ARM,
if I may digress a bit, which is one of the black economic empowerment
companies which have done sterling work in this area. They now want to get
into platinum. That is a deal that we are looking at with a lot of interest
and on which we would like to see progress. This kind of a Bill must enable
more companies to achieve that progress because, for us, that is very, very
critical. Those principles are not in question and they will not be
compromised. The social plan, as we have it in the Bill, will not be
compromised either.

Oom Nash, wayi, uyabetha man! [Oom Nash, you are really excellent!]

Regarding the issue of the In Bond Landed Cost, because of the limits of
time I would just like to bring to the member's attention - and he probably
knows this by now - that there are different studies that we have embarked
upon to address the issue of the IBLC. The truth of the matter is that
petrol and oil are very expensive now. The price is genuinely high. We have
tried to look at how we can tinker with and look into the IBLC in order to
improve the value that accrues to the customer. We have not been able to
find what we can call a comforting answer. However, that does not mean that
we are not working on it. Outside this meeting, I can tell him about the
different initiatives that are in place.

There was also a comment on the SA Diamond Board. The SA Diamond Board is
in good hands. Mr Chikane, who is sitting over there, is the new chairman
of the diamond board and he is doing sterling work. There is no crisis in
the diamond board. They are continuing with their work.

Mr I O DAVIDSON: He has just been appointed.

The MINISTER: No, he has not just been appointed. He has been there for a
few months. He has been able, within the time that he has had to turn the
situation around. I appeal to that member not to dwell on the past.

Regarding the issue of deep-level mining, work is being done. Government is
supporting the work that is being done in deep-level mining. Of course, we
remain committed to ensuring that we can increase safety, because, as
members can see, we do have problems of accidents and we are therefore
committed to investing resources in order to improve the situation. I am
running out of time.
On the issue of small-scale mining, I take the points that have been made.
We are also concerned about the extent to which it continues to be
difficult for small-scale mining to progress in the manner in which we
would like it to. However, we do have measures in place, including a joint
venture which we are going to undertake with the industry to provide
finance to small-scale mining. The venture is called Bakopong.

The issue of Eskom and Pebble Bed Modular Reactor was mentioned. It is not
true that Eskom is moving ahead without due regard to policy. Before Eskom
can implement the PBMR project, they have to come back to Government for
approval. As far as we are concerned, they are busy with the feasibility
study. That feasibility study has not yet come back to us. When it comes
back to us, we will be in a position to take a decision. They have not
prejudged the issue. Thus, I think that it is actually a red herring to
regard that as a done deal, because there is a lot of work that still needs
to be done.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, your time has expired.

The MINISTER: I would also like to join Comrade Oliphant in expressing
appreciation for the kind of contribution that the NUM continues to make
and for the leadership that they provide.

On the issue of women training in both minerals and energy, I would just
like to say that I support the points that were raised by hon members. I
would also like to say that we have spent a lot of time supporting women
who are involved in mining, oil and gas. A training programme has already
been put in place for women involved in oil and gas, in order to make sure
that we can facilitate their integration into the industry.

In relation to beneficiation, a lot of ground has already been covered.
What we promised members in the past year - ie the establishment of a
champion who will look into the strategic questions that need to be
answered, so that we can advance the beneficiation to the jewellery sector
in particular - is in place. Probably at any time the portfolio committee
can invite institutions to come and give them a progress report. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 3 - Foreign Affairs:

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Chairperson, hon members, Deputy
President, ladies and gentlemen, and comrades, first and foremost, I would
like to thank the Chair and all the members of the portfolio committee for
their co-operation and understanding, particularly for the Minister's
absence from the country most of the time. The co-operation of my Cabinet
colleagues is also appreciated. I wish to thank the director-general and
his team, who are working very hard to carry out the mandate of the
Government. Lastly, allow me to thank my mother and my children for their
understanding.

John Reader says in his book on Africa entitled Africa: A Biography of the
Continent:


  South Africa preserves a flickering hope of transforming dreams into
  reality.

He further says:


  Nelson Mandela and the shifting political power that he represents affirm
  the value of integrity and ideas in an era where economic pragmatism is
  the dominant theme of world affairs. He and South Africa offer hope for
  all humanity. Yes, hope from a continent that for too long has seemed to
  generate nothing but despair.

Our foreign policy, therefore, is not only anchored in our domestic policy,
but on this very fact and responsibility that John Reader is talking about
- that South Africa offers hope for all humanity. Thus, we cannot only
strive for a better life for South Africans, but we have to contribute to
the ongoing struggle for a better world. That is what gives us a degree of
moral authority in the world.

Our words and deeds, individually and collectively, have to make sure that
this flickering hope of transforming dreams into reality is not dashed.
This has to start with transforming South Africa into a nonsexist,
nonracial, democratic, stable, peaceful, just and equitable society - a
nation united in its diversity.

Internationally, we continue to struggle for a world with the following
values, amongst others, democracy, good governance, people-centred
development, peace, stability and security, promotion of co-operation,
partnership and good neighbourliness. As Africans, our major efforts are on
the African continent and amongst the developing countries.

Regarding democracy, South Africa actively supports the establishment of
democratic governments, not only in the continent but the world over. The
resolve of the African leaders to isolate and banish any leader who takes
power through a coup is a very revolutionary step. The major challenge is
to strengthen democratic institutions to defend and sustain democracy.
South Africa is prepared not only to support but to defend democracy, as we
did in Lesotho. We are working closely with Rwanda, for example, which is
struggling very hard to turn the nightmare of the genocide into a dream of
hope where there will be peace, democracy, justice and prosperity for all
Rwandese.

Internationally, we have seen a resurgence of right-wing parties,
especially in developed countries. In the recently held conference on the
Community of Democracies, we exchanged information and examined the
workings of democracies with developed countries. It emerged that developed
countries, too, have problems with the working of their democracies. For
instance, during elections they have very low turn-outs and weak coalition
governments. Maybe they do need some assistance from us.

With regard to peace, stability and security, South Africa is committed to
making a contribution towards a peaceful continent and a peaceful world.
Peace and stability are the prerequisites for democracy, development and co-
operation. The UN Security Council remains the agent of our collective
security. In discharging our responsibilities as members of the UN, we are
actively participating in the UN's peacekeeping missions in Ethiopia,
Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where we sent a contingent of
specialised units. We are also participating in an effort to restore peace
in Burundi, with former President Mandela as facilitator.

Judge Langa is involved in the efforts to resolve the problems in Fiji
through the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, peace in Angola and Sudan is still
elusive and therefore presents a challenge to all of us. We commend Ecowas,
together with the UN, for the good work they are doing in Sierra Leone. As
South Africa we are very concerned about the situation in the Middle East,
in Palestine. It is, in the first place, the most serious crisis in the
world at present. If not resolved it has the potential to destabilise not
only the region, but the world. It might unleash the worst form of
terrorism.

The Palestinians have a right to self-determination and therefore the
realisation of a Palestinian sovereign state remains a goal. Israel, of
course, has a right to exist and to be secured, but the security of Israel
is also linked to the security of the Palestinians and the region as a
whole. It is important to encourage the Israelis and Palestinians to go
back to the negotiations. We also endorse the call by President Arafat to
use the Egyptian-Jordanian plan as a basis for their negotiations. It is in
that spirit that, as the Chair of the Nonaligned Movement, we convened the
committee on Palestine here in South Africa last week.

There are concerns around matters of stability in our region. Stability in
our region and around our borders is very important. In this regard we
would like to welcome President Chiluba's decision not to go for a third
term. This will strengthen democracy and encourage stability in Zambia, and
we hope everyone will follow that example.

Zimbabwe, of course, remains a great concern to us. We have to continue to
engage the Zimbabwean government, whilst pointing out firmly and frankly
where we disagree. We have a responsibility to avoid a complete collapse
and not to make things worse for the ordinary Zimbabweans. All of us can
help up to a point, but it is the Zimbabweans who must, surely, take the
final decisions. The future destiny of Zimbabwe is in their hands. Of
course, the land issue still needs to be resolved, because it will not go
away. But it has to be resolved lawfully and peacefully.

South Africa must continue to act in a way that maintains that flickering
hope of transforming dreams into reality, rather than to get that short-
term praise that does not solve the problems, in the same way that the
Lockerbie impasse was unlocked by engaging the Libyans and other parties,
and not by condemning them. Of course, the Government was condemned at the
time, but we persevered until a solution was found.

With regard to disarmament, global disarmament is high on our agenda for
peace and stability in the world. Today, if I may remind hon members, is
the 56th anniversary of the end of World War II. This, surely, must remind
the world of the important international treaties and agreements which
should be implemented and strengthened, in order to finally eliminate all
weapons of mass destruction. The agreements and arrangements inevitably
involved compromises on all sides. Unilateral actions destabilises fragile
global security arrangements, and should be avoided.

South Africa has placed a high priority on the elimination of antipersonnel
mines and the illicit trafficking and proliferation of small arms and light
weapons. These weapons are contributing to conflicts. We have collectively
expressed our views through the OAU Bamako Declaration of 2 December 2000
and through the ADC declaration on firearms in March 2001. We shall
actively participate in the first UN conference on this topic and we shall
seek to promote international co-operation in the fight against illicit
trade in small arms and light weapons.

With regard to the culture of human rights the UN Universal Declaration of
Human Rights recognises, inter alia, that all human beings are born free
and equal, with dignity and rights. They have inherent dignity, equality
and the inalienable rights of all members of the human family, which are
the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. It also
proclaims the enjoyment of freedom of speech and belief, freedom from fear
and want as the highest aspiration of ordinary people, and reaffirms faith
in fundamental human rights, the dignity and worth of human persons and the
equal rights of all people.

South Africa is in the forefront of this struggle, having introduced this
culture of human rights, through the ANC Government, for the first time in
our country. Human rights have to include the right to education, health,
shelter and food. Human rights include children's rights and we have to
work hard for the elimination of child soldiers, child labour, child abuse
and trafficking in children. Children must be allowed to develop their full
human potential in a peaceful, stable and secure environment. Women's
rights are human rights. South Africa is also in the forefront of the
struggle for a nonsexist world. We hope that the international community
will continue to support these struggles for the emancipation of women in
all countries.

The world is becoming increasingly intolerant. Racism, xenophobia and
religious intolerance, including Islamophobia, are on the increase. We have
to be relentless in this struggle, given our tragic history. Our
contribution to the world conference against racism is going to be very
important, not only in hosting it, but in the actual debates and
influencing the outcome of the conference. South Africa was chosen
precisely because of this flickering hope of transforming the nonracial,
nonsexist dreams into the reality that South Africa holds. These are
challenges of our time and we have to rise above them.

With regard to people-centred development, there is now consensus the world
over that the biggest challenge of the 21st century is Africa's
underdevelopment. South Africa is expected to play a leading role, together
with other countries, in tackling this challenge. It was agreed in Cairo
last year that we need a Marshall Plan for the recovery of Africa.
President Mbeki, with the presidents of Algeria and Nigeria, was then
mandated to develop this plan. Senegal and Egypt have now joined the team.

They are developing what is called the Millennium African Recovery
Programme. This is a plan inspired by Africa's own architectural, artistic
and cultural heritage, as well as Africa's ancient civilisation. It is
informed by the challenges facing us, especially Africa's underdevelopment
and marginalisation in this global village, and it identifies priorities
that must receive immediate attention. These include the following: Peace,
security and governance, investing in Africa's people, including education,
health, food and food security; diversification of Africa's production and
exports; investing in information; communication technology and other basic
infrastructure; and developing financing mechanisms.

For the successful implementation of the plan, we need partnerships at
various levels with governments, business and civil society, as well as
multilateral organisations such as the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund, and other institutions. We also need co-operation with the
G8, the EU, the Nordic countries, China, Japan, Brazil, India, and the Arab
countries as well as the countries of the South.

In pursuance of these objectives, later this month, we shall also be
participating in the third UN Conference on the Least Developed Countries
in Brussels, which will decide on measures to improve the plight of the
LDCs. Next year, the UN Conference on Financing for Development will take
place in Mexico, further to find means and ways to extricate developing
countries from conditions of underdevelopment. The Conference on
Sustainable Development to be held in Johannesburg next year is very
important, in this regard, in people-centred development.

South Africa will have to contribute to this not only by attending
conferences and developing plans, but by making its own institutions and
resources available for the implementation of this Millennium African
Recovery Programme.

Africa also needs institutions to carry out this agenda at the national,
regional, continental and international levels. So, to this end, the
restructuring of SADC should result in raising the effectiveness of this
organisation. The recent extraordinary summit held in Windhoek approved the
report on the review of the operations of SADC institutions presented by
the Ministers. The major recommendations of the report include a more
streamlined and centralised structure for the organisation, which moves
away from the sectoral approach of the past, in favour of an integrated and
co-ordinated programme of activities for the region.

The organ of politics, defence and security which has been in existence
since 1986, under the chairpersonship of Zimbabwe, will henceforth be
chaired on a rotational basis, with the period of chairpersonship being a
year. The chair of the organ shall not simultaneously hold the
chairpersonship of SADC and will be accountable to the chair of SADC and
the summit. Like SADC, the organ will also function on a troika basis. The
successful conclusion of the restructuring exercise is certain to impact
positively on SADC's regional quest to position the region favourably to
collectively address the challenges ahead.

What institutions do we need on the continent? We know that the African
Union is almost a legal entity. Two-thirds of the countries have ratified
the Constitutive Act. In this regard, I commend the swift action taken by
this House to enable Government to ratify this Act, and, as a result, we
are amongst the 36 founder members of the African Union. The African Union
is going to deal with political and stability issues as well as
developmental and economical matters.

There will be technical committees which will deal with the following:
rural economy and agriculture; monetary and financial affairs; trade,
customs and immigration; industry, science and technology, natural
resources, environment and energy; transport, communication and tourism;
health, labour and social affairs.

The Constitutive Act makes provision for a defined transitional period to
ensure a smooth and gradual transition of the OAU and AEC into the Union.
The Pan African Parliament, in which members of this House will
participate, has a critical role in evolving common values of democracy,
human rights, governance, nonsexism and tolerance on the continent.

Democracy is not only important for countries, but international
institutions must also be democratic. In order to achieve a just world
order, the reform of international institutions is a must. South Africa is
committed to the reform and fundamental renewal of multilateral
institutions to bring about a system of global governance that is more
just, representative and sensitive to the needs of Africa and the South.
The UN Security Council, the World Bank, and the IMF, to name but a few,
are of particular importance in this regard.

The Security Council is the premier global instrument to safeguard
international peace and security, but because of its unrepresentative
nature it is facing major challenges to its credibility. It is therefore
not in an ideal position to effectively fulfil the fundamental
responsibilities entrusted to it by the international community at the time
of the adoption of the charter. The issue is of particular importance to
Africa and the developing world.

As a Government and a department, do we have the institutional capacity to
carry out this formidable task before us? My simple answer is that we are
not. We are short-staffed, both at head office and abroad. But the Deputy
Minister will, in his speech, deal with what we are doing to restructure
our own department in order to meet all these challenges.

Before I conclude, I would like to remind the hon members that there are
global health challenges that we are facing. Two weeks ago the leaders of
the continent were grappling with the question of HIV/Aids, TB, malaria and
other communicable diseases in Abuja in Nigeria. The struggle for health
care is right and must continue. In a few months, the UN will also focus on
the most serious health challenge of our time - HIV/Aids. But, for all
these challenges and struggles, we need to mobilise the most important and
dependable partner, the masses of our people in South Africa, on the
continent and in the world.

It has been shown that with their support, the struggle for justice, peace
and development can be won. The small but significant victory against the
pharmaceutical companies is a good example. The struggle for affordable
drugs is a just struggle to save lives and humanity. We must continue to
offer this hope. In the same vein, let me express my deep gratitude to the
international community for its solidarity with South Africa on this
matter.

I do hope that the opposition parties, particularly the New NP, the DP and
the others, which voted against this Bill at the time and launched a
scathing and vitriolic attack against the Government, will be big enough to
admit that they were wrong and join the ANC in the struggle for a just and
equitable world, rather than be informed by narrow and sectorial economic
interests and the protection of the rich. The struggle for a better world
continues. [Applause.]
Mr E I EBRAHIM: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, and hon members, today my
committee will make a case to this House that South Africa, as one of the
leading nations in the global south, assumes a heavy responsibility that
requires, from the Government and people of the country, not only an
ideological commitment, but resources.

For some years now, the world has heard us talk about the African
Renaissance, and South Africa's pivotal role in realising that vision. We
have talked about liberating the developing world from the marginalising
effects of globalisation through regional, economic and political
integration.

Since January this year President Mbeki has outlined the Millennium Africa
Plan to heads of states from the north and south. These leaders have thrown
their support behind the plan for an African-led revitalisation of the
continent. Now the time has come to translate these visionary ideas into
action, to operationalise the concept of bridging the digital divide, to
ensure that the overwhelming debt burdens of poor countries are reduced, to
form an African peacekeeping contingent, to facilitate conflict resolution
processes, to build our infrastructure, and to invest in our people.

There is only one way to ensure that we move beyond rhetoric, and that is
to give our department of Foreign Affairs and other relevant departments
the necessary economic means with which to implement MAP and other foreign
policy priorities. Six years ago my predecessor, Raymond Sutner, complained
that only one sixth of the funds budgeted for foreign missions was
allocated to missions in Africa. At the time this indicated that
expenditure priorities on foreign missions in developed countries did not
match our rhetoric about promoting south-south co-operation as a foreign
policy goal. We are now expanding more of our resources into Africa despite
an overall shrinking Foreign Affairs budget and greater expectations of the
role South Africa should play in international affairs.

However, we should note, with concern, the fact that Cuba, with far greater
economic constraints, currently has more diplomatic missions in Africa than
our own country. The message is twofold: The Foreign Affairs budget should
be augmented if we are to marry our words to action. There is every reason
for South Africa to play a key role in the south if we are to make
globalisation work to our advantage.

On May Day this year, we witnessed violent demonstrations against the
process we have come to know as globalisation. People in London, Sydney,
Berlin, Zurich, Moscow, and many major centres around the world, protested
against the capitalist forces they blame for their own disempowerment. How
much more severe is the marginalisation of people in developing countries,
where in terms of the seeding demonstration in Africa, half of the
population of sub-Saharan Africa live on 65c a day, the continent
contributing only 1,2% of the world'd GDP?

Perhaps our lack of radical demonstration is testimony to the sense of
disempowerment and the accompanying apathy many of our people feel.
However, the continent is yearning for leadership to champion its causes.
It is looking to South Africa, in partnership with others, to speak for the
developing world and to push its agenda. As the chair of the Nonaligned
Movement, a leading voice in the South and leader of other forums, South
Africa needs to ensure that the developing south, notably Africa, remains
relevant and fully integrated in the global economy.

Despite the Afro-pessimism that has prevailed in much of the international
media, Africans and the developing world have considerable potential in the
global marketplace. If we are to prosper we need to accept the realities of
globalisation and actively confront the challenges of the New World Order.
Through our solidarity we can collectively ensure that we capitalise on our
strengths, gain preferential access to key markets and leap-frog stages of
development.

South Africa, by virtue of its economic and political clout, needs to be
the steam engine that drives forward the practical implementation of the
continent's renaissance plan, as we confront globalisation head on. We have
not shied away from this role, taking up the challenge in bodies such as
NAM, SADC and, most recently, pushing for the creation of a G5 or G-South
gathering of leading developing states. Along with Egypt, Brazil, Nigeria
and India, we have committed ourselves to playing a key role in the setting
and implementing of a new agenda for the South. This will entail working
closely with multilateral institutions while pushing for their reform.

We must break the monopoly of influence held by former colonial powers and
the United States. It is up to us to spearhead initiatives for the reform
of the United Nations Security Council and to ensure that the developing
world has veto powers on matters of peace and security. As a leading nation
of the South, we also need to continue to press for the need for deeper and
faster debt relief. It is unacceptable that some developing countries pay
more to service their debt than they spend on health and education. Debt
reduction is an issue that our President has championed unrelentingly in
multilateral meetings, and representatives abroad need to sustain the
momentum behind the debt-reduction drive.

While we strive to liberalise our own markets, we must ensure that the
northern countries do the same. We cannot play the liberalisation game on
our own, removing local subsidies while European countries subsidise their
farmers to the tune of $360 billion a year. We cannot accept the behaviour
of major powers, such as the United States, when they slap import taxes on
South African steel as soon as we are seen to offer serious competition to
American steel producers.

It is also our responsibility to ensure that unbridled capitalism does not
strip our continent of its wealth of resources. As an economic bloc, we
need to develop protocols and rules to regulate and monitor lucrative
extraction industries in Africa. All these responsibilities call for an
activist foreign policy that takes pre-emptive measures, as opposed to
reacting to events around us. It is through strategising and mobilising our
communities in the South that we will take charge of our own economic
destiny. Just as foreign policy must seek to extract major commitments from
the industrialised north, so we are to continue laying the foundation for
south-south co-operation.

Building strong regional organisation will enable us to remain influential.
In our own case that means strengthening SADC structures and defining clear
economic objectives and strategies. The SADC Free-Trade Protocol that came
into effect in January 2000 shows that we are moving in the right
direction. Our Ministers are concentrating on developing an integrated
industrial and agricultural strategy. South Africa's leadership in building
a strong economic community will be decisive for the region's fortunes. A
strong economic community will be decisive for the region's fortunes. As
the largest and most industrialised economy in the region, contributing 75%
of SADC's GDP, we have the capacity to build a strong economic bloc.

The leitmotiv of our strategy to revive our region and our continent must
be economic empowerment. This requires us to provide decisive leadership in
our foreign policy and strengthen the strategic partnership with other key
countries in the south. We can only provide this leadership and strengthen
the structures of SADC if we invest the necessary resources in the
Department of Foreign Affairs.

Coupled with our economic imperatives, our focus also needs to be on
building sustainable peace on our continent. This means expanding resources
for conflict resolution efforts at the political level. We need to be
proactive in preventing, managing and resolving conflict through timeous
diplomatic intervention leading to negotiated settlement. It is not enough
to watch the tragedy unfolding in Sudan. It is up to us to push for the
Africanisation of the peace processes on the continent and to put pressure
on belligerents, on all sides of this conflict, to get serious about peace.

We have seen the reluctance of the north to contribute troops to conflict
areas on the continent. While the United States has referred to the
conflict in the DRC as ``Africa's first great war capable of engulfing the
entire region'', they are unwilling to place a single American soldier on
the ground. The gap between the rhetoric and practice remains in force.
There are all the signs of growing Western disengagement from the
continent.

Like the Clinton administration, Bush will continue to circumvent efforts
to place anything but a token force in the Congo, and reject intervention
in Sierra Leone and other conflict zones outright. Despite the best efforts
of South Africa's most revered statesman to bringing peace to Burundi, if
that country implodes, there is no mechanism in place to intervene with a
rapid-response military force.

We have talked endlessly about the need for a standby force with this
capability but, seven years after the genocide in Rwanda, we are still
unsure how we would mobilise for such an intervention. It is time to start
learning from history, time to exercise our muscle to galvanise our
regional partners to put their structures in place. If one is not prepared
to set aside additional funds for such initiatives, our intentions will
merely remain intentions.

While it is conflict in Africa that preoccupies us, we cannot ignore the
devastating conflicts in other parts of the world. Not speaking out against
the deteriorating situation in the Middle East and strategies for peace in
that region, would be a shameful dereliction of our moral responsibility as
leader of the developing South.

South Africa believes in the universality of human rights. We have to work
to protect the human rights of those, not only in Africa, but wherever they
are, who are abused. We cannot accept what amounts to virtual ethnic
cleansing in the Palestinian area by Israeli forces. We condemn the
bulldozing of Palestianian homes, the killing of innocent children,
including a four-month-old baby, and the continued occupation of
Palestinian land. As the Chair of the Nonaligned Movement we are in a
position to influence the situation and bring the parties together for
strategising for peace.
In conclusion, South Africa has a special responsibility and leading role
to play, both in Africa and the developing South. We cannot purport to
implement visionary plans without committing the necessary funds to make
them happen. While my committee recommends the adoption of the Foreign
Affairs budget by Parliament, we would like to see it augmented. We should
all realise that a stable, developing Africa and a broader South properly
integrated into the global economy are in the vital national interest of
South Africa. It is time to harness the forces of globalisation to our
advantage: it is time to liberate the South.

In conclusion, I would like to thank all members of my portfolio committee
from all parties for the wonderful co-operation I received throughout the
year. [Applause.]

Mr C W EGLIN: Madam Speaker, the hon the Minister gave us an interesting
and fairly extensive overview of the activities of the department
throughout the year, and anticipated activities in the future. We
appreciate this. In the brief moments that I have available, I would
perhaps gently touch on one of them from a different perspective.

The process of globalisation, combined with the development of electronic
information communication technology, is having a profound impact of the
nature of international relations and the manner in which these relations
are conducted. While bilateral relations between countries will remain an
important component of foreign affairs as national boundaries become less
significant in determining the destiny of peoples, foreign affairs
activities are increasingly being conducted through a number of
multinational organisations in which discussions, negotiations and policy-
making take place on a regional,
shared-interest, global basis.

This trend has resulted in a considerable increase in the work and
responsibility falling on the Presidency, the Minister and her department.
During the past year South Africa, under President Mbeki, played a
significant and constructive role in international affairs. In this we have
all been assisted greatly by our evergreen former president Mandela. The
Minister has tackled her responsibility with energy and dedication, which
explains why she is so seldom in the House. We accept that. The department,
hampered by limited funds, aggravated by the declining value of the rand,
has battled to provide a reasonable backup for South Africa's ever-
increasing foreign commitments. The officials of the department deserve our
appreciation. Perhaps the tangible way we can express this is by voting the
department significantly more funds than presently provided for in the
budget.

There are a few questions of an administrative nature that I would like to
put to the Minister. The first concerns the crisis that has occurred
amongst the department's personnel as a result of the Receiver of Revenue
deciding to tax the allowances of personnel serving abroad, a decision that
will cut the income of interns by up to 30% and more. In reply to a
question, I was informed that the department is making representations to
the Treasury. I put this to the Minister. Has this matter been resolved in
a way that will be fair to the personnel who are affected?

Secondly, in a world becoming increasingly geared to the use of modern
computer and information technology, our foreign service cannot afford to
be left behind. Is the department taking adequate steps to see to it that
this will not happen? Thirdly, what steps is the department taking to
recruit, train and equip young women and men for careers in the diplomatic
service? Is there still a cadet training scheme and, if so, what results
has it produced in recent years? Topping up the diplomatic corps by
redeploying politicians is an easy way out. But it is bad for the morale of
staff members wanting to make the foreign service their career. In the long
run, as a personnel practice, it will be counterproductive.

The Minister has already stated that to be coherent and of optimal value to
South Africa, foreign policy must be structured as a integral component of
our overall national policy. Firstly, it must reflect the values to which
our nation is committed. In the past, democracy and human rights have been
defined as one of the cornerstones of our foreign policy. Secondly, our
foreign policy must be in harmony with our national priorities. Foreign
affairs must be conducted in a manner that will support and not undermine
the attainment of these priorities.

The DA has no doubt that South Africa's national priority at this stage
must be economic growth in order to achieve human development. Indeed, this
was the thrust of the President's opening address in Parliament this year.
However, as the Minister would know, a government's ability to achieve
positive results in the international arena and to influence people and
governments out there, depends to a major extent on what is happening
inside a country - the integrity of its government; the stability of its
society; the strength of its economy; the depth of its commitment to
democracy and the rule of law; and the stature and behaviour of its
leaders. These criteria apply to South Africa as much as they do to other
countries. It is against this background that the Minister of Safety and
Security, in two minutes of blasting on television last week, did more
damage to the stature of South Africa and its President in the field of
foreign affairs than any other persons or any group of persons has done to
South Africa since we became a democratic country several years ago.
[Applause.]

Secondly, a further consequence has been that South Africa has had the
invidious experience of its head of state being questioned at length on
British television not only on the alleged plot to oust him, but on the
allegation that he had been involved in the assassination of Chris Hani. I
imagine the millions of overseas viewers shaking their heads in absolute
disbelief, asking: ``What is going on in South Africa? Can this be the same
South Africa that produced the political miracle of 1994?'' No wonder South
Africa's missions around the world, were inundated with calls and
enquiries. Our foreign diplomats, who would normally use their time to
promote South Africa's interests, were forced to use their time to do
damage control.

Recently President Mbeki, accompanied by the Foreign Minister and others,
paid a state visit to Cuba. During the visit, Presidents Mbeki and Castro
praised each other's governments and people, especially in the context of
their historical relationship. During that visit, they both avoided
referring to the sensitive issues of democracy and human rights. It was
Minister Zuma who, towards the end, spoke of these matters. Coming from a
country whose past struggle and present Constitution are centred on
freedom, democracy and human rights, the Minister's comments were
disturbing, for they have serious implications for the direction that our
foreign policy takes in the future. Indeed, they cast doubt on the
Government's concept of democracy and commitment to human rights. The
Minister is quoted as saying:


  Yes, it is so that there are not many political parties here, but ask the
  Cuban government how they make laws and you will be amazed at how
  democratic they may be.
Does the Minister not realise that democracy is not primarily about how a
government makes laws, but whether or not a government was put into place
by a free and fair election? If there are no other parties around in Cuba,
it is because parties are not permitted to be around, because they are
banned and their supporters are detained, in jail or in exile.

The Minister links lying in the gutter with having a vote. She is quoted as
asking: ``Would you rather be lying in the gutter with a vote, or be a poor
person in Cuba? Further, would you rather be a hungry person with the right
to speak, or do you want a good education with enough food?'' To link lying
in the gutter with having a vote is ridiculous. To link hunger with the
right to speak is absolute nonsense. The poverty which persisted after 40
years of Castro rule is largely because the Cuban people have not had the
free vote which would enable them to decide on the best economic system for
their country. They do not have the right to engage freely with the
economy, to empower themselves to be entrepreneurs. They live on as
dependants of the state.

Yes, there are positive things that we can learn from Cuba, such as
prioritising of scarce resources, the delivery of selective services and
the sense of humanity which exists amongst the people. Those are things
which we could learn, but none of these justify a South African Minister
defending an all-authoritarian political system. On the contrary, South
Africa should be extolling the virtues of democracy and using the power of
democracy to stimulate the economy, roll back poverty and create a better
life for all. I want to ask the Minister to think very seriously about what
she said and to explain to us how this could be seen, in terms of our set
of values, as far as democracy and human rights are concerned.

Perhaps the greatest challenge facing South Africa in the field of foreign
affairs is in Africa, in and within Africa, right here in the Southern
African region. On the wider African scene, two important developments have
taken place this year. One was the ratification of the treaty to constitute
the African Union. The other is the Millennium African Recovery Programme,
MARP, which was outlined by President Mbeki in Davos this year. Both of
these developments present exciting challenges for the future.

Mr N J GOGOTYA: Madam Speaker, will the hon member please tell us about the
40 years of Cuban blockage by the United States, and whether it is
democratic, as part of his speech. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! I am sorry I cannot hear you. Is it a point of order
you are raising?

Mr N J GOGOTYA: Yes, it is a point of order. I would like the hon ...

The SPEAKER: Order! Will you remove your hand from the microphone, please.

Mr N J GOGOTYA: I would like to ask the hon member to tell us about the 40
years of the United Sates blockage ...

The SPEAKER: Order! I am sorry, hon member, that is not a point of order.
[Interjections.]

Mr C W EGLIN: Madam Speaker, may I continue? I have now lost one minute of
my time. The immediate challenge is right here in the Southern African
region. The fact is that the SADC region is not in good shape. The war in
Angola continues, seemingly without end. In the DRC, the war splatters on
while the process of democratisation has not even commenced. In Zimbabwe,
presidentially condoned anarchy has now spread to businesses, shops,
factories and tourist resorts.

Clearly, South Africa's policy towards Southern Africa, whatever it was
intended to be, has been unsuccessful. The Minister has admitted that SADC
has not done enough, compared with Ecowas and Mercosur. She said much
energy must be put into SADC, and South Africa might follow a more dynamic
approach to diplomatic measures in the region, instead of merely reacting
to situations.

Could the Minister please tell us of this more dynamic approach, in so far
as it affects Zimbabwe, in so far as it affects the SADC. Has the time not
come for South Africa to give more focused attention to the SADC region?
Should there not be a special department, at least, headed by a Deputy
Minister, whose function would be to co-ordinate the activities of the
various departments, keep in constant touch with SADC structures and
governments, and give some impetus to the whole process of regional
integration?

Regrettably, the African Renaissance will remain just a dream if an
important region like ours cannot get its house in order. We, the DP,
believe that it can and must be done. [Applause.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, I am a bit surprised at the attack
which the hon Mr Eglin made on the Minister. [Interjections.] He spent much
of his time attacking the Minister, and I think that he used arguments that
are not sound. I think he should be ashamed. The Minister, the Deputy
Minister and the department are doing their best, and we think they should
be applauded. Thank you, Minister, for what you are doing. [Applause.]

I also wish to extend a special word of thanks to the ... [Interjections.]
Why do you not ask for an opportunity to speak? The reason why you make so
many interjections is because your Whip does not trust you to come and
stand here, and make a speech. [Laughter.]

I also wish to extend a special word of thanks to the hon the Deputy
Minister of Public Works, Mr Musa Zondi, who, until elevated to that
position, was the IFP's chief spokesman on Foreign Affairs.
An HON MEMBER: We wish he still was.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: I do not blame you, and this is only the beginning of
what I am going to do to you and your party. [Laughter.]

The Minister is asking Parliament to appropriate R1,660 billion for the
year 2001-02, which is R165,3 billion more than the previous year. It is an
increase of 10%, but, taking inflation into account, it is only a 4%
increase. It is, therefore, clear - and I think Mr Eglin should take notice
of this - that the Minister has succeeded in keeping her budget within
reasonable limits.

There are some interesting expenditure claims over the seven-year period
from 1997 to 2004. Firstly, the budget programme for foreign relations
dominates the budget by consuming about 72% over the seven-year period.
Secondly, expenditure on the Vote as a whole grows by an annual average of
about 5,9%. It is interesting to note that the increase of 5,9% is below
the average inflation rate of approximately 7,5%, bearing in mind that the
budget was continuously under pressure from the danger of currency
devaluation. Therefore, in essence, the Foreign Affairs budget demonstrates
a real decline in expenditure, despite strong pressure from variables which
are difficult to control. We therefore support the Vote.

Looking at the international political theme from a macro point of view,
one asks the fundamental ... [Interjections.] Please leave Ambassador
Jannie Momberg out of this, will you? [Interjections.] Incidentally, Mr
Ambassador Momberg, when are you leaving us? When are you being appointed?
I believe that the Minister also wants to appoint Mr Mike Ellis to a
diplomatic post. He is going to become the ambassador on Robben Island.
[Laughter.]

I want to ask a fundamental question, and that is: With which countries is
South Africa to side in the international world? Now that the bipolar
system of the USA and the USSR has disappeared, we are dominated by only
one superpower today, the USA, and we feel that we should ask the question:
Are we doing the right thing today, when we openly interact with the Cubas,
Libyas and Yasser Arafats, which was not the position in the past?

I want to tell Mr Eglin that I was very surprised with Cuba.
[Interjections.]
Mr C W EGLIN: There is no democracy in Cuba.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: He says that there is no democracy in Cuba. What type
of democracy is it when there is only one party, but 90% of the people vote
for Castro, and they do not have to vote. What is that called? Is that not
called democracy? [Interjections.]

In Cuba - and I hold no brief for them - they have transplanted more than 1
000 hearts; they have enough teachers for the whole population and they
have enough doctors. And all those people have work. If I may ask: What the
hell has the DP to do with Cuba? Why do they want to prescribe to the
Cubans?  [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: [Inaudible.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: I do not blame Mike. I think he should get that
diplomatic post immediately. The Minister is sending him to Robben Island
today, but without pay. [Laughter.]

In conclusion, we wish the Minister and her deputy well. We also wish the
officials of South Africa's Department of Foreign Affairs the best of luck.
They are the people who have to fight our battles far from home, often in
the cold. They are our A team. They must go well. [Applause.]

Mr E M SIGWELA: Madam Speaker, hon Minister and colleagues, I note with
pleasure that the most central objective of the Department of Foreign
Affairs is to see that South Africa's policies, programmes and services
promote this country's national interests and values abroad.

It is not in the interest of the ANC-led Government to throw its weight
around in other countries. We do not, like some people would like us to,
desire to extend the hegemony of South Africa to other countries. It is not
our style, and not our taste, to give orders to any nation that they should
march to the right, to the left or to the centre, ordering their affairs.
What we would like most to happen is that nations of the world should live
in peace and friendship with each other, respecting the independence, self-
determination and territorial integrity of each other.

This, we believe, should be the basis of our co-operation with other
nations. This is the fundamental principle that, for example, drives our
relations with our neighbours in the SADC region. When we co-operate with
them in projects such as the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, the Maputo
Corridor SDI, the Maguga Water Project in Swaziland, and the Trans-Kalahari
SDI, from Botswana down to Namibia, we are propelled and guided by the
desire for peace, security and mutual friendship among the peoples of
Southern Africa.

Yes, our detractors will point to the current turbulent state of the SADC
region, the wars that seem to have no end in sight, the volatile situations
in Zimbabwe, Swaziland and, to a minimal extent, Lesotho. They will see our
ideal of peace and friendship as an unrealistic Utopia. They would like to
see us rattling the sabre against those of our neighbours who seem not to
show enough respect for our ideals and values. [Interjections.] The hon
member knows them. We know that kind of diplomacy.

The old South Africa of the NP, the South Africa of oppression and
repression, not only rattled the sabre against its Southern African
neighbours, but it terrorised and brutalised them in a manner that had
never been seen elsewhere before, except, perhaps, in the current manner in
which Israel deals with the Palestinian authority areas and its
neighbouring states.
Ndilikhumbula kakuhle - ixesha apho uMzantsi Afrika wawusebenzisa isandla
esingqwabalala - andiqinisekanga nokuba inkonzo yotoliko iyafumaneka na ...
[I remember very well the period during which South Africa was very
repressive ...]

... at least Mr Eglin understands - against its Southern African
neighbours.

Wawunyhukrula, ubulala, ushiya izidumbu, iinkedama, abahlolokazi nabahlolo.
Ndithetha ngexesha apho nkqu namajoni ... [He terrorised, killed, left
corpses, orphans, widows and widowers. I am speaking about the times when
even soldiers ...]

... their own soldiers, the young people of the SA Defence Force at that
time, were wondering what was happening. They were thrown into Botswana one
night when there were raids on three countries, ie Botswana, Zambia and
Zimbabwe. The South African soldiers were inside Botswana already. They
were standing there, ready for anybody who resisted.

I remember the interview that I had with Paul, the young soldier who
deserted from Voortrekkerhoogte and travelled all the way, thinking that he
was going to a foreign country when he went to Transkei. He only found
himself being prepared to be sent back to Pretoria. I remember very well
the things that he told me about how they were being abused - the
traumatisation of the youth of our country. The white youth is also our
youth, never mind that I am black. Black like I am, they are our youth. I
remember vividly. I knew then that something was wrong with the South
Africa that we came from.

I would like to urge the hon the Minister to be strong. We should never go
back to that. We should entrench our policy in the principles that we
believe in which are the principles of peace and friendship with other
people and respect for the independence, integrity and self-determination
of other peoples. That should be our guiding principle. We should not waver
to this or that side because we have detractors making noise at our ears.

I want to say that the ANC-led Government will not shed its responsibility
of contributing to or even taking the initiative in the resolution of
conflicts in our region. However, in doing so, among other things, we will
be guided by our knowledge of the social, economic and political history of
the region. We will not only deal with the outward manifestation of
conflicts, but also, and more particularly, with their internal dynamics,
because it is only by so doing that we will able to find lasting
solutions.] [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, if the hon member Koos van der Merwe is
to be appointed as ambassador, it will definitely be New Orleans out of
fear that if they send him further, he would be on his way back again.
[Laughter.]

The hon the Minister referred in her speech to the global health
challenges. Allow me in this regard to ask the hon the Minister a direct
question. Will the South African Government support Taiwan's entry into the
World Health Organisation which is due for consideration next week in
Geneva? Health hazards do not recognise ideological barriers. Taiwan's
entry is of the essence and they can make a valuable contribution in this
regard. I will appreciate a reply from the hon the Minister.

Someone once asked what the difference is between a diplomat and a
politician. In civilised diplomacy, diplomats speak well of each other in
public and are rude in private. In civilised politics, politicians are rude
to each other in public, but are friends in private. Being a civilised
politician, I hope that slight rudeness on my part in this debate on
Foreign Affairs will be forgiven.

The alleged investigation by the state police of possible contenders for
the presidency must make it extremely difficult to market South Africa
abroad as an investment haven. Despite this, many diplomats on the home
front and abroad excelled in doing just that and they undoubtedly deserve
the thanks of the House. Unfortunately, a few, yes, perhaps a few too many,
embarrassed South Africa through bad behaviour. No names, no pack drill.

Diplomate behoort met groter omsigtigheid gekeur te word. Hoewel dit die
President se prerogatief is om hoofde van missies aan te wys, behoort die
portefeuljekomitee ook by die proses betrek te word en hoofde van missies
behoort op 'n tweejaarlikse grondslag verslag te doen aan die
portefeuljekomitee op buitelandse sake. Dit sal die band tussen die
Parlement en die buitelandse verteenwoordigers versterk.

Die eensydige besluit van die Suid-Afrikaanse Inkomstediens, die agb lid
Colin Eglin het daarna verwys, om buitelandse toelae met 38% te belas en
wat tot 'n aansienlike salarisvermindering gelei het, is onaanvaarbaar.
Hopelik sal die agb Minister so gou as moontlik die gesprek hieroor met
haar kollega die Minister van Finansies hervat. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Diplomats should be selected more carefully. Although it is the
President's prerogative to appoint heads of missions, the portfolio
committee should also be involved in the process and heads of missions
should report on a two-yearly basis to the portfolio committee dealing with
foreign affairs. That will strengthen the ties between Parliament and
foreign representatives.

The unilateral decision by the South African Revenue Service, to which the
hon member Mr Colin Eglin made reference, to tax foreign allowances with
38%, which resulted in a considerable reduction in salary, is unacceptable.
It is hoped that the hon the Minister will resume her discussions in
respect of this with her colleague the Minister of Finance as soon as
possible.]
The department should be complimented on its tireless efforts to secure the
release of Callie and Monique Strydom who were taken hostage by a
Philippine splinter group. All the people of South Africa rejoiced in their
safe homecoming. Tough but crucial questions, however, remain unanswered.
Was a ransom paid for their release and if so, by whom? What is the
Government's position on the payment of ransom money?

If Col Gaddafi was the benefactor, did he indeed pay the ransom or did he
merely persuade the Abu Sayef rebels, whom he trained and bankrolled in his
own country, to release the hostages? If the latter is the case, he surely
does not deserve the praise bestowed upon him by the South African
Government, because it could be argued that if he did not train and
bankroll the rebels in the first place, they would not have been in a
position to take any hostages at all. The South African Government should
refrain from embracing Col Gaddafi too openly, because the final word on
Lockerbie has not been spoken yet.

The Minister's defence of Cuba's human rights record and the support given
her by the hon member Koos van der Merwe, is astonishing. If one
whitewashes a country where hundreds of peaceful opponents of the
government are behind bars, one makes a nonsense of one's own foreign
policy of promoting democracy and human rights.

A new approach should be adopted by the international community towards
pariah states such as Libya, Iraq and Cuba, and the South African
Government should follow suit. Instead of punishing the people of Cuba,
Iraq and Libya, the self-imposed tyrants should be isolated internationally
and brought to book if necessary. [Interjections.]

What further raised the eyebrows was the Minister's astonishing letter to
her counterpart in London, Robert Cook, in which she complained about Peter
Hain's criticism of South Africa's so-called quiet diplomacy towards
Zimbabwe. Believe it or not, by his continual refusal to reprimand
President Mugabe publicly for what is currently happening in Zimbabwe,
President Mbeki seems to be the only stranger in Jerusalem.

By not publicly reprimanding President Mugabe, President Mbeki is
ironically shooting his own illustrious Millennium African Recovery
Programme in the foot. Strong regional economies form the cornerstone of
the Millennium Africa Recovery Plan, but by continually inciting the so-
called war veterans to occupy industrial farms, to intimidate
businesspeople, to harass political opponents, President Mugabe has not
only pushed Zimbabwe's economy over the cliff, but has also brought the
region's economy to the brink of collapse, to the detriment of the
Millennium African Recovery Programme.

President Mbeki can no longer afford to play the role of William the
Silent. The time has now come to reprimand President Mugabe publicly in
order to sideline him politically. If the President does that, the New NP
and the DP, alias the DA, will support him fully. [Applause.]

Mr M E MABETA: Madam Speaker and hon members, I would like to start off by
asking the hon the Minister a few questions.

Firstly, has the Minister, in any way, been in contact with the Zambian
government in the run-up to attempts by them to alter the constitution?
Secondly, in her speech, the Minister of Foreign Affairs mentioned that
there is a need for the mobilisation of masses of our people in the
advancement of our foreign policy's basic objectives. Is the Minister going
to create space here, beyond the portfolio committee, for the different
political parties to participate and, in some way, make a contribution?
Thirdly, the other question I would like to ask the hon the Minister is:
What attempts are being made to mobilise different South Africans beyond
the ruling party to participate in changing the regimes of the
international institutions?

To this effect I, firstly, would like to congratulate the Speaker of the
House for the very leading and instructive role she has played in the
establishment of the Constitutive Act of the African Union. Secondly, I
would like to express my personal appreciation for the initiative taken by
the Director-General of Foreign Affairs, Mr Sipho Pityana, and his
spokesperson, Ronnie Mamoepa, for formally asking His Grace, the Right Rev
Bishop Lekhanyane of the Zion Christian Church, to include in his Easter
message to 3,5 million congregants a prayer for peace and national
reconciliation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We say peace in the
DRC, peace in Africa, peace in the whole world and peace in our lifetime
with regard to Israel and Palestine.

We, as a country, having been inspired by the democratic principles
underlying our Constitution, made a commitment to contribute to the
advancement of democracy on our continent and the world. President Thabo
Mbeki, his foreign Minister, the hon Dlamini-Zuma, with the much-needed
support from Africa's statesman, former president Mandela, have
participated and contributed to numerous bilateral and multilateral
dialogues for peaceful settlements of dispute amongst groups locked in
bloody civil wars in our region.

I would like to state quite clearly that these efforts will go a long way
towards being meaningful if we can, at the same time, as a country and,
together with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, take definite, bold steps in
the reorganisation of the different organs within SADC, so that we do not,
as a country, make contributions to peaceful settlements of disputes when
our regional organisations are lagging behind and, in many ways,
undermining these efforts.

Our constitutional right as opposition parties compels us to demand of
Government a foreign policy that is coherent, consistent and in keeping
with the promotion of our national fundamental interest. Equally, duty
demands of us as political parties in the opposition, to contribute to the
advancement of these basic interests by honestly pointing out the
weaknesses where they exist and volunteering to assist where we can make a
difference.

I am sure I will be the first person to recommend that the hon Mr Eglin be
made the next ambassador to Cuba. I know that country and I am sure that he
will be accepted very well. I am sure he will change his views on this one.
[Interjections.]

The UDM calls on the Foreign Minister to adopt a clear and tough policy
with regard to Zimbabwe. How much room is left for the situation there to
collapse completely? Can we really take the risk of deferring on what is
happening in that country? Zimbabwe is a big economic burden on our
country. We need to continue to pressurise that government by diplomatic
means, not in a reckless manner. We need to stand firm and say to the
people of Zimbabwe that we are calling for democratic rights for all people
there, white, black, everybody, just as we did in South Africa. We should
not make the Zimbabwe issue a party-political issue. [Time expired.]

Mr M RAMGOBIN: Madam Speaker, the Minister, colleagues in Parliament,
perhaps it would have been good if Mr Van der Merwe had asked Mr Colin
Eglin whether he supported Dhlakama, the war criminal in Mozambique whom as
Mr Colin Eglin knows, the NP government supported.

However, I believe that for most people on the DA side the African
Renaissance is an event. I do not believe it is so, as any matric student
could illustrate to them that it is a revolution, which, to my mind, is
permanent. And rooted in this revolution is what we call the Millennium
African Recovery Programme.

This ideally must engender the resolve among all South Africans that they
are Africans. This resolve can best be illustrated by all of us in this
House to our respective supporters who sent us here. With our Parliament,
we are living examples of the phrase: ``Our country belongs to all who live
in it'', even though, in the words of President Mbeki:


  ... we are a people of many colours, races, cultures, languages and
  ancient origins, that tie to one another by a million visible and
  invisible threads. We share a common destiny from which none of us can
  escape, because together we are human, we are South African, and, above
  all, we are African.

On the basis of this common humanity and Africanness, President Mbeki's
profiled African vision is rooted in the needs of our country, indeed, as
well as in the African continent. The ANC, through the Government, ensures
that the two legs of our policy towards the continent are solidly anchored,
one in the developing world and the other in the developed.

Of course, for our foreign policy personalities such as former president
Mandela and our current President Mbeki are essential components. But the
ANC has further ensured that South Africa develops a sustainable foreign
policy which is more dependent on policy and processes than on
personalities, a policy which, in the words of the former director-general,
Jackie Selebi, ``... is more predictable, and not one that suggests that we
collide with events''. A question arises: If this is the background of the
ANC's policy options, is the Foreign Affairs' budget adequate for these
processes? I would politely say: No.

Given its history, the ANC has set itself a challenge in transforming our
own country on the basis of a revolutionary ethic. We are consciously
committed to another revolution. As co-initiators of the Millennium Africa
Plan, we are saying that Africa must cease to be a theatre of war, poverty,
disease and pestilence. Instead of being recipients of handouts, we can,
and have to become a bread basket.

On the basis of shared interests, this plan emphasises the need for global
partnerships, as the hon the Minister has said in her opening remarks,
between our continent and other parts of the world. Because this is not an
easy task, Foreign Affairs alone cannot provide the basis for the success
of the plan.

The architects of Map did and still visualise the engagement of interline
functions. Whether it is human resources development, the agri industries,
urban renewal, rural development and information communication, there has
to be a co-ordinated initiation of programmes and an oversight of these to
measure outcomes. I believe that the budget, in its present form, does not
provide for it.

The African leaders and the forum of leaders who make decisions on
programmes and subprogrammes and review progress on their implementation
will, of necessity, have to deal with multilateral organs such as Unicef,
Unesco, WHO, and others. They will have to co-ordinate NGOs in the
different countries with special reference to women's rights, human rights,
the environment, youth, religious institutions, professional bodies,
institutions of higher learning and technology, and business and trade
unions. Governments alone will fail to achieve these goals of the
Millennium African Recovery Programme.

I think, as an example, that the Earth Summit of 2002 will be a very good
experience for South Africa, because I believe it will be a major step for
the consolidation of mapping out the MARP initiative for sustainable
development and will perhaps be a challenge to the US policy on the
environment as it exists today.

We in South Africa are saying that these people can and must ensure an
appropriate policy environment. We have this under the leadership of the
ANC. What we need now, as a matter of urgency, is a national will. Instead
of sections of South Africa hankering for the idiocies of apartheid, social
separation and subjugation, coupled with the economic exploitation of
colonialism, all of us have to be part of efforts to stabilise our country
and our continent.

It is not good enough to pronounce and mobilise opinions and resources, as
was done in the case of anti-Aids drugs in Switzerland, and doing nothing
to mobilise against the South African pharmaceutical companies who took us
to court and failed. NGOs have a critical role to play as partners and not
with a holier-than-thou attitude, as shown by some members of this very
Parliament.

For MARP to succeed, I believe we have to take a step backwards and find
out what some members of the opposition are saying about our foreign
policy. They are saying that South Africa, on the question of Zimbabwe, has
reached a defining moment. They are saying that we should have more sticks
and fewer carrots. They are saying that it is not the willingness and the
capacity and exercise of efforts towards peace and stability as seen, among
other things, in our contribution to the peace efforts. They are not saying
this. They are not saying that our efforts in Zimbabwe and in the Great
Lakes area are bearing fruit. They are not saying that it is in the
interest of South Africa as a whole and the region, in particular, and the
African continent, in general, for us to adopt this method of quiet
diplomacy.

What they are saying is that we should give them more sticks and fewer
carrots. This is according to Mr Eglin's leader, who was quoted in the Time
magazine of 28 April as saying that President Thabo Mbeki should give Mr
Mugabe more sticks and fewer carrots. It is the wrong policy and I think it
should be ignored with the contempt that it deserves, because they are
ignoring the fact that the defining moment of our foreign policy is not
rooted in the interest of white South Africa, it is rooted in Davos, in UN
multilateral institutions, in NAM, in South-South considerations and
positively in the IMF, defining their methods of engagements for the rest
of Africa. [Interjections.] [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, post-1999 there has been a rapid increase of
participation by our country in international affairs. This is owing in
part to the MARP initiative. Despite our domestic and regional problems,
our country is and is seen as providing a crucial platform for economic
trade and the development of the rest of the continent.

The ACDP wishes to support the recent pronouncements by the President on
MARP, which puts the emphasis on Africans themselves as being responsible
for putting their house in order, so as to become effective players in
world trade. In this regard we must continue to work towards an end to the
conflicts in the continent, especially in the SADC region. The Government
must continue to work to establish peace, encourage African leaders to
leave office after their terms have expired and promote multiparty
democracy.

The President, speaking at a recent foreign affairs conference in Cape Town
a few months ago, raised the question of whether the department has
sufficient capacity to effectively ensure the success of MARP. The said
capacity, in my view, not only relates to competence and planning, but also
to whether there are sufficient resources in the department to carry out
this MARP initiative. The recent trip by an American multimillionaire,
Dennis Tito, into space, is an indication of how far one can go if there
are enough resources.

In view of the increased role of the department in creating opportunities
for economic trade all over the world and the undoubted scarcity of
resources in the countries to support this initiative, has the time not
come for more and closer co-operation between this department, Trade and
Industry, and to a lesser extent, Defence? The recently announced plans to
tax the allowances of employees in the foreign service if not accompanied
by an equivalent increase in those allowances will, in my view, become a
self-inflicted impediment in the advancements of the MARP initiative.

The ACDP supports the budget, but has serious reservations as to the
adequacy of resources in the department to carry out the MARP initiative.
The time has come for the relevant departments - the ones I have mentioned
above - to stop speaking about clusters, but to begin to plan, to share
resources and to work together to ensure that the initiative succeeds.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, hon members, as the
Minister and various speakers have indicated, the current global system is
characterised by the restructuring of international organisations and
institutions in order to meet the challenges of globalisation. Equally, the
Department of Foreign Affairs has to restructure and transform itself to
deal with broadened responsibilities and greater challenges that we have to
tackle.

The department embarked on and made progress with several transformation
initiatives at different levels. It is clear that in order to fulfil and
contribute effectively to our challenges and obligations, we need to have
more capacity in terms of resources, both human and financial, as well as
diverse representivity, reflective of South African society. These are
integral aspects of the department's restructuring and transformation.

We have developed a four-year strategic plan with specific priorities for
2001. The strategic plan would ensure that the implementation of South
Africa's foreign policy objectives is conducted in a co-ordinated and
integrated way. It also forms the basis on which business plans of all
units of the department and performance management agreements have been
developed. Ultimately this process will culminate in more efficient service
delivery by the department and a sharpened focus on the attainment of the
country's foreign policy objectives.
An important component of Government's broad reconstruction has been the
shift towards co-ordinated governments through the cluster system.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I think
it is shameful that when the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs is speaking
here, there should be so much chatter, especially across there. We should
all listen to the Deputy Minister when he is speaking about these very
important matters.

The SPEAKER: Thank you, hon Minister. Hon members, I hope you will pay heed
to what has been put forward and listen to the speakers. The purpose of our
meeting is to debate. Please proceed.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: The Cabinet cluster of international relations, peace
and security has developed a long-term four-year strategic plan. It
constitutes the high-level objectives, priorities, strategies and action
plan. The cluster also produced the 2001 strategic priorities which include
the political, security, development and co-operation issues. This also
incorporates the programmes of action, as well as the key departments
responsible for their implementation. The IRPS cluster has also instituted
mechanisms to monitor and guide us on the successful delivery of the agreed
programmes. It is important that the relevant portfolio committees and
Parliament are continuously seized with these developments.

It is in this spirit of the integrated approach of Government that an early
warning centre has been established. I believe that this centre will
increase South Africa's capacity to respond to ever-changing world demands
and to meet peace and security obligations. As the challenges of our
foreign relations grow, so does the need to expand our operations abroad.
Missions in Tripoli and Kigali are currently being established, and several
other centres have been identified where South African representation is
essential to expanding and developing political, economic, social and
cultural relations. The institutional and organisational changes that I in
brief referred to that the making of South Africa, also internationally,
will fail if all of us do not seriously accept our patriotic
responsibilities.

Mr Cronje, Chairman of Absa, wrote in Business Day of 27 October 2000:
  Today, internationally, Afro-pessimism is a reality. Who is responsible
  for this? Some South Africans too often market their country as the
  basket case of the world. Some South Africans publicly extol the values
  of South Africa, only to inform listeners privately of the deep concern
  about the way things are going.

He goes on to say:


  Business leaders cannot expect international investment if they are not
  willing to invest themselves. Business confidence relies on a degree of
  positive massaging and marketing to maintain a positive side.

He ends by asking: ``Why is our society so convinced that things can only
get worse?''

A successful foreign policy strategy demands that we answer Cronje's
questions. Why do some of us consistently orchestrate the theme that things
can only get worse? It is worth recalling that eight years ago our country
was undergoing one of the world's worst racial conflicts. Thanks to far-
sighted political leadership and the humanity of all South Africans, we
astounded the world and gave birth to a democratic South Africa.

Today we can proudly proclaim that South Africa has taken giant strides in
consolidating its nonracial and nonsexist democracy and in tackling the
legacies of the past. This does not mean that we do not have much more to
do. However, those who are objective and honest have to admit that the
Government is succeeding in creating a caring and people-centred society.
Despite what the DA continues to say, South Africa is becoming a winning
nation.

Mr Cronje said in the same article, and I think he reflected the view of
many, and I quote:


  South Africa is succeeding because the signs are there. Government
  borrowing is down, inflation is under control, monetary policies appear
  to be in safe and competent hands, the needs of disadvantaged communities
  have been addressed more actively than at any other time in our history,
  personal and corporate tax have been reduced, exchange controls have been
  effectively removed for the vast majority of South Africans, and the
  economy is growing close to a rate not seen since the gold boom in the
  1980s.

The things Cronje referred to have been manifest in many studies. The
latest World Competitive Report has found that South Africa is now one of
the world's top performers in industrial electrical supply, the cost-of-
living index, telecommunications investment, effective personal income tax
rates, and public expenditure on education. We were ranked above major
players such as the USA, Japan, Britain, France and Germany.

This is the success that we are talking about and not the negative things
that the DA opposition keeps harping on about, or indeed, the spokesmen for
DA policies on many occasions. The Financial Mail noted on 27 April that,
since its positive report two weeks before, South Africa's economy was
better than originally thought. It went on to say that a report from the UK
research firm, Investment Strategy Group sketched a glowing picture of
South Africa, exhorting investors to go along on equities and the rand. It
went further to say that South Africa had the greatest potential in the
emerging countries to grow in the coming period. Therefore, it is vital
that all South Africans, including the DA, accept this reality and reflect
a new patriotism that allows them to become ambassadors projecting the
image of South Africa as a winning nation.

Surely the DA must come to the conclusion that party politicking in this
crucial stage is not enough. Surely they must understand that the positives
that we have achieved in our country outweigh the negatives. It is for this
reason that the President established the International Marketing Council,
which brings together top business, marketing, nongovernmental and relevant
governmental structures to advise the Government on improving South
Africa's image abroad.

Unfortunately, I must once again say the discussion today reflected that
this is not an easy task. The problem lies not in the abilities of the
Government or other structures involved in market South Africa, but sadly,
as Cronje said, with South Africans projecting South Africa as a so-called
basket case where nothing can be rectified. These are the people wanting to
deny the enormous progress we have made, the possibilities our country
offers and the significant returns on investments in our country.

I accept that it is vital in an open democracy for citizens to question
policy. But when members of the opposition openly systematically distort,
indeed, sometimes frankly lie and misrepresent positions of South Africa,
then we must accept that they are becoming the proponents of that which
gives us a negative image abroad. Therefore we must accept that the DA must
accept its responsibility to become better citizens.

It is therefore important that today, as the DA has spent a lot of time on
mentioning the negative image that the hon Minister Tshwete is giving South
Africa, I take the opportunity to quote some examples of South Africans
spearheading the campaign to negatively project South Africa
internationally. Today, given what the DA had been saying, let me reflect
on what the Leader of the Opposition, the hon Leon, said recently in
international conferences. Indeed, it was sad to hear the DA reflecting
some of those same negative sentiments in South Africa.

These sentiments state that South Africa is in a crisis, that there is a
crisis of confidence because of morbid racial paranoia. He made this speech
to the United Stated Business Council. It goes on to say that South
Africa's crisis is because of Zimbabwe. It further states: ``Instead of
President Mbeki condemning Mugabe, he has sat down and had tea with the
arsonist.'' It goes on to suggest to the American audience that South
Africa must uphold land rights by acting against a small but alarming
number of copycat land invasions in our own rural areas.

I want to ask: How is it possible for the Leader of the Opposition,
speaking to a major American audience, to begin to suggest that there is
even a possibility of South Africa becoming a country where we will allow
land invasions to take place? It was the hon Leon who was espousing the
thesis that he will help the Americans to put pressure on us to prevent
this.

HON MEMBERS: Sies! [Disgraceful!]

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Why did he not reflect what this Government's policy
is? In fact the same hon Leon, in another speech, surpassed himself even
further when he was talking to the SA-US Chamber of Commerce. He again
harped on the same nonsense that my colleagues were talking about, which is
Zimbabwe, and said ...

An HON MEMBER: Which was the truth!

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Absolute distortion! Most damaging of all to the
confidence in Africa, is the impression created by SADC, including
President Mbeki, that neighbouring states agree with land grabs and state
intimidation of opposition parties as an acceptable way to run a country.
Where did they get this distorted logic that they can project this as what
is happening in the Southern African region?

But, more dangerously, in this speech the hon Leon, after quoting some
ridiculous statistics, said that the ANC had begun to highlight racial
differences in our society and played the race card at every opportunity.
[interjections.] ``By now Nelson Mandela's party is closing many doors of
political, economic, and cultural advancement one by one in the face of
minorities.'' This is Tony Leon speaking to an American audience.

Increasingly, the principle of nonracialism is being sacrificed on the
altar of power politics. It is a tactic which our society, media, judiciary
and opposition must see for what it is and resist with all our resources.
Is the hon Leon trying to mobilise support in the United States and
elsewhere in a kit and kit argument? I want to warn Leon and his entourage
that, like Hitler and Goebbels, they will learn very quickly that to play
the racist game is a very dangerous game and, like Hitler and Goebbels,
they must wake up to the reality and stop playing this game of the ANC
becoming a racist organisation, threatening the stability and security of
all minorities.

This is not the reality in our country, and I believe the Democratic
Alliance, through their leader and individually, must stop playing this
card, because it is not in the interest of South Africa as a whole. I want
to make a call on the DA. Surely the time has come that they should grow
up. Infantile, childish disorder is okay for a certain period, but if they
continue to remain infantile, childish and disorderly, we in this House
have to ask whether this is acceptable and possible.

Surely they must wake up to the reality that they cannot find a few more
votes, get another extra dollar or gain more support internationally by
playing this negative card that they are playing. I want to say that for
international relations and for international politics, and for the
interest of South Africa, we want to call on the opposition, especially the
DA, to act more responsibly, in the interest of the country and the people,
and not in their personal interest. [Applause.]

Ms F HAJAIG: Madam Speaker, Minister and Deputy Minister of Foreign
Affairs, colleagues and comrades, I rise to support this Vote.

The Treasury has made available R1,6608 billion for the budget of 2001-02.
The Department of Foreign Affairs has been given ever-expanding tasks and
one needs to ask the question whether this sum is sufficient to enable them
to carry out their mandate.

We would like to thank the director-general, the deputy directors-general
and other personnel who have worked so hard to bring about the necessary
restructuring in the Department of Foreign Affairs. I am glad to say that
there are at least four women here today, which is pleasing. [Applause.]
That is very significant. Thank you for starting the process.

An HON MEMBER: They have got brains as well.
Ms F HAJAIG: Which you do not have. [Laughter.] Since 1994, with the birth
of our democratic state, South Africa has made great strides in putting
South Africa on the world map as a respected and responsible nation which
takes its domestic and international duties and commitments seriously.

In every corner of this world, our transition to democracy is hailed as a
victory for the dignity of humankind. Our achievements have been many since
1994, but our great challenge is yet to come: The realisation of the
economic and social development agenda for Africa, namely MARP, the
Millennium African Recovery Programme.

Two spokes in the wheel which will drive MARP are a strong and efficient
Organisation of African Unity and Pan-African Parliament. Fundamental to
this process is the restructuring of the institutional framework of the OAU
and the regional economic communities, which, in our case, is SADC.

On 11 July 2000, the OAU, AEC and the Assembly of Heads of States and
Governments adopted the Constitutive Act of the African Union. The African
Union will evolve from the OAU and the AEC, into one unified institution.
The Act makes provision for a defined transitional period of a year or
more, which will ensure a smooth and gradual transition of the OAU and the
AEC into one union. The ratification ...

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Dream on! Dream on!

Ms F HAJAIG: I do not know why you are in South Africa. Please leave.

An HON MEMBER: Tell him! Tell him! Tell him!

Ms F HAJAIG: The ratification of two-thirds of the OAU's 53 member states
will establish the African Union. Furthermore, the Constitutive Act
specifies that the organs of the African Union and its structure should
reflect the transitional approach, with priority given to the establishment
of organs and institutions identified, such as the Pan-African Parliament.

Apart fron the Pan-African Parliament, the Act also provides for the
establishment of a common court of justice, a common African central bank,
an African monetary fund and an African investment bank, as well as several
specialised technical committees in areas such as rural economy and
agriculture; monetary and financial affairs; trade, custom and immigration;
industry, science and technology; energy, natural resources and
environment; transport, communications and tourism; health, labour and
social affairs; education and culture; and human resources.

The Lusaka Summit scheduled for July 2001 will officially declare the
African Union. The adoption of the Act should be seen as the first step in
an ongoing process to streamline and rationalise the existing
organisational framework of the continent, in so doing making the African
Union relevant to the demands of the 21st century and to achieve the
ultimate goal of complete African unity.

The Constitutive Act will eventually replace the OAU Charter of 1963. South
Africa will assume the chairmanship of the first African Union Summit in
July 2002, providing us with a unique opportunity to further our objectives
of promoting the vision of the African Renaissance and the principles of
good governance, democracy and respect for human rights on our continent.
Lest we forget, it was the OAU that relentlessly assisted us in our fight
for freedom.

Some of the objectives of the African Union are to achieve greater unity
and solidarity between the African countries and the peoples of South
Africa; to defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence
of the member states; to accelerate the political and socioeconomic
integration of the continent; to promote and defend African common
positions on issues of interest to the continent and its peoples; to
encourage international co-operation, taking due account of the United
Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; to promote
peace, security and stability on the continent; and to promote democratic
principles and institutions, popular participation and good governance.

My time is unfortunately running out, so I am going to skip some of the
things which hon members can read up, especially those on the left-hand
side of the House. I hope they do read the Constitutive Act. I do not think
they have. [Interjections.] No, they have not. [Laughter.]

I just want, very briefly, to outline the draft agreement for the Pan-
African Parliament. Parliamentarians from all over Africa met in Pretoria
in November 2000 to draft a protocol which has been adopted by the Heads of
State of the Organisation for African Unity.

The idea of a Pan-African Parliament came from the Abuja Treaty, adopted in
1991 by the OAU. The Pan-African Parliament would bring the elected
representatives of Africa together to deliberate on common African issues,
particularly to take forward the objectives of achieving the successful
development of the continent. The Pan-African Parliament budget will remain
an integral part of the African Union budget.

The Pan-African Parliament can become an important point of influence in
Africa. It was agreed that the Pan-African Parliament would receive regular
reports from the African Union. It will also deal with development in
countries on the continent. There will also be regular meetings for the
general gathering of members. Parliamentary committees will also be
established to look at important objectives such as peace and democracy.
The languages of the African Union, namely English, Arabic, French and
Portuguese, will be used. Initially the Pan-African Parliament will be a
deliberative organ. It will not have legislative powers.

These are very important developments for us and our continent. We as South
Africans are fully committed to our destiny, which is Africa. It is in
Africa that we find our biggest markets. We have come home to Africa after
350 years. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairman, I have four minutes and I want to discuss
four issues in this limited time. If one plays a game of chess, at a
certain point in the game chess players start talking about the end game.
In Zimbabwe, we are now moving into the end game phase, as far as I am
concerned.

It is sad to see a country's leaders destroying their own country. The
question is: Is the South African Government ready to play this end game?
Are we putting all our money on President Mugabe to survive and win the
presidential elections? What is our position on the leader of the
opposition, Morgan Tsvangirai? At the moment he is the accused, with a
possibility of a life sentence. In Africa my experience is that tomorrow he
may be the next president of Zimbabwe. Do we plan for that? Do we take that
into account in our actions?

Surely the Government must have realised that their policy of silent
diplomacy which they have followed up to now, has failed. The hard reality
is that when Zimbabwe makes mistakes, South Africa suffers as well. When
the Zambian President Chiluba makes mistakes and tries to ignore the
constitution, South Africa suffers as well. The dream of an African
Renaissance, with multiparty democracy in Africa as the cornerstone, as the
President stated, moves away from us.

My tweede punt: Aan die begin van hierdie jaar het ek die voorreg gehad om
China en Hong Kong te besoek. Die verhouding tussen China as 'n soewereine
staat en Hong Kong as 'n eiesoortige gebied wat homself regeer, maar dan
tog ook deel van China is, is uniek.

Die implikasie hiervan is dat Hong Kong as deel van die ooreenkoms tussen
China en Hong Kong sy eie internasionale ooreenkomste met ander lande
aangaan. So het meeste lande reeds ekonomiese en ander ooreenkomste met
Hong Kong gesluit. Suid-Afrika huiwer egter om hierdie ooreenkoms op die
oomblik te sluit. Miskien omdat ons bang is dat ons daarmee aanstoot gee
aan China, en tog keur China hierdie werkswyse van Hong Kong goed. Suid-
Afrika verloor tans talle ekonomiese en handelsgeleenthede teenoor ander
lande, omdat ons nie ons ooreenkomste met Hong Kong sluit nie. My vraag is:
Het ons al hierdie ooreenkomste met Hong Kong gesluit, en indien nog nie,
wanneer beoog die Regering om dit wel te doen? (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The second point: At the beginning of the year I had the privilege to
visit China and Hong Kong. The relationship between China as a sovereign
state and Hong Kong as an autonomous area that governs itself, but is also
part of China, is unique.

The implication of this is that Hong Kong enters into its own international
agreements with other countries as part of the agreement between China and
Hong Kong. In this way most countries have already entered into agreements
with Hong Kong. However, at the moment, South Africa is still hesitant to
enter into these agreements. This is possibly because we are afraid that by
doing so we will offend China, and yet China approves of this modus
operandi of Hong Kong. South Africa is currently losing many economic and
trade opportunities with other countries because we are not entering into
agreements with Hong Kong. My question is: Have we already entered into
these agreements with Hong Kong, and if not, when does the Government
intend doing so?

My third point is: Why do we have ambassadors and representatives abroad in
different countries? One of the main reasons, surely, is to enable us to
communicate better with the people of other countries and to tell them
about South Africa. Therefore, in most embassies, translation services are
important to translate our messages into the local languages of those
countries.

In the Netherlands, we have a website on the internet which the explains
South Africa and its policies to the people of the Netherlands. I can give
members the address. My question is: Why is that website only in English? I
will be willing to translate it into Afrikaans to make it easier for the
people of the Netherlands to understand our message. But, surely, the ideal
situation is to translate it into Dutch and show our respect to those
people and their languages.

As Jan Momberg of Karel Niehaus in Nederland was, kon hulle ons gered het.
Ek weet nie waar die fout ingekom het nie, maar dit gee tog aanstoot.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[If Jan Momberg or Karel Niehaus were in the Netherlands, they could have
bailed us out. I do not know where we went wrong, but it nevertheless
offends.]

My fourth point is that South Africa became the 35th member state of the
Organisation of African Unity which deposited its instrument of
ratification of the Constitutive Act of the African Union to the OAU
General Secretariate. South Africa, Nigeria and Egypt are seen as the big
and strong countries in Africa. In international affairs, small countries
always want to get some power and influence over the big ones.

Some articles in the Constitutive Act are overidealistic and ignore, as far
as I am concerned, some basic principles of the sovereignty of countries.
The problem that we faced, as members of Parliament, was that we could not
really amend the document and we were under pressure to adopt it because of
limited time. In future, the South African Government will have to be very
careful not to let small countries, specifically African countries that are
part of the OAU, try to use these articles to prescribe to us, using the
Constitutive Act, and maybe at the end of the day try to influence and
attack our sovereignty as far as that is concerned.

Hier is vandag baie oor Kuba ges√™ en ek wil tog net vinnig daarop reageer.
Die finale toets is: Of mense na 'n land beweeg of uit 'n land uitbeweeg?
Ek was nog nie in Kuba nie, maar die feit bly staan, as twee miljoen mense
uit Kuba vlug, dan moet ek 'n vraagteken daarby plaas, veral as mense na 'n
ander land vlug. Dit is 'n baie ernstige toets wat Kuba tans nie slaag nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[A great deal has been said about Cuba here today and I would briefly like
to respond. The final test is: Whether people move into a country or out of
a country? I have never been to Cuba, but the fact remains, if two million
people flee Cuba, then I must put a question mark next to it, especially if
people flee to another country. This is a very serious test that Cuba does
not pass at this stage.]

Ms M M MAUNYE: Ke a leboha Modulasetulo [Thank you, Chairperson]. Hon
Minister, comrades and friends, I will start by quoting what Comrade
President Mandela once said:


  If we move with undue speed towards the noble ideals of full integration
  and trade liberalisation, negative migration in capital, skills and
  labour might well set in. We would wish to see balanced and equitable
  development throughout the region, to the mutual benefit of all its
  people.

The issue of regional integration efforts is not a new phenomenon in
Africa. Africans have recognised this fact as a necessity right from the
1950s. Africans recognise that for them to make a dent in the international
political and economic system, they need to co-ordinate their economic and
political efforts.

I want to focus on the issue of the Southern African Development Community,
its relevance today, and the importance of democratisation in the region
and in Africa in general. What we do must reflect in what we say.

The globalisation process has left us with very limited choices. The first
choice is to join the globalising world without any questions. The second
is to close our markets and isolate ourselves from the rest of the world.
This choice does not work and its future is bleak. The third, and last
point, is to have countries of the South in general negotiating as a bloc.

Regional integration is exactly for that purpose. The regional integration
process provides us with the opportunity to negotiate, as a bloc of
countries from the South, with a stronger voice and guarantees us the
chance to get a better deal for our countries and the people of our region
as a whole.

For all this to be possible certain things have to be done by African
leaders and the people they lead. Among those are the following: democracy
and democratisation, transparency and human rights.

The gospel from the 1950s onwards has been democracy. We cannot allow
despots to continue to rule our countries and loot the national resources
which are desperately needed for the development of our people and
countries. Organs of civil society must help governments set up democratic
structures. If we do not democratise, the international community will
further marginalise us.

The whole world has a negative impression of Africa. We have the duty to
correct this impression. We need to demonstrate to the world that we are
serious about our democratisation efforts and the development of our
people. If we do not move with haste in this regard, we will be left out in
the cold.

Transparency and human rights are cornerstones in the process of renewing
Africa. The issue of human rights is critical. If we do not respect human
rights, our democratic efforts are guaranteed to fail, something we can ill
afford.

The issue of the Southern African Development Community is critical. As I
indicated before, the regional integration process is not new on the
continent. SADC, as a community of nations, is undergoing transformation.
Among the institutions to be established is the one dealing with women.
This is very important today, because women constitute more than 50% of the
entire population. If we leave them out of the process of development and
integration, our efforts will be futile.

Women are cardinal to our society's development and progress. They need to
be empowered and encouraged to play a pivotal role in the process of peace
and social progress. SADC has great potential for their development and
economic growth, but hard work still needs to be done.

Challenges facing the region and continent, among others, are the
Democratic Republic of Congo, the Angolan situation, attracting foreign
direct investment, child labour and slavery. The situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo is changing for the better. It seems, once
more, that efforts put together by the Africans for the Africans are
bearing fruit. The Lusaka peace agreement is, once more, demonstrating our
capacity as the people of the continent. The people of the DRC will enjoy
peace for once in their lifetime.

Angola remains one of the biggest challenges facing the region and the
continent. Stability in Angola promises great development for the region.
Angola has everything the country needs for its development, but the war
continues to hinder its progress. We need to redouble our efforts for peace
and social progress. [Time expired.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Mr Chairperson and hon Minister, in considering this
budget, certain fundamental principles, such as the following, must be
taken into account: acknowledging that the Department of Foreign Affairs is
responsible for the maintenance and promotion of South Africa's external
international relations, the weak rand exchange rate, South Africa's
leading role in Africa, and the hosting of various important events.

Senior officials in the department often complain that the budget that the
Ministry receives is inadequate to effectively carry out its various policy
objectives and to maintain and increase its foreign representation abroad.
The question that must be asked about the 100 plus missions abroad is: Are
they producing results? Has any cost-benefit analysis been done? If not,
why not?

The introduction of tax on foreign service allowances will impact
negatively on officers' salaries. Maintaining the same net after-tax salary
for diplomats abroad entails increasing the personnel component of foreign
representation by R178 million.

The negative effect of exchange rate volatility on the Department of
Foreign Affairs' budget is a recurring problem. A joint task team including
the Department of Foreign Affairs' and the Department of Finance's
officials should, on a quarterly basis, monitor the rand performance and
study some contingency measures.

It is evident that the R1 666 814 voted for 2001-02 is inadequate to meet
the Department of Foreign Affairs' priorities. [Time expired.]

Dr S E PHEKO: Mr Chairperson, now that the Pan-African Parliament and the
African Union, ushered in by the irresistible vision of Pan-Africanism, are
a reality, African states must rise to the occasion in defence of Africa's
interests and take the destiny of this continent into their own hands for
posterity. Africa must not be a spectator in world affairs. The primary
role of Pan-Africanism is to redeem Africa from years of foreign
domination, powerlessness and humiliation.

The PAC is disturbed that not much has been done by African states to
resolve the present political instability and to end the civil wars in
countries like Sierra Leone, Liberia, Somalia and Guinea. Instability in
any African country affects the continent. Our foreign policy must assist
other African states to avoid attracting excuses from foreign powers for UN
sanctions.

At 12:01 on Monday, 7 May, the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on
Liberia. The resolution was jointly sponsored by the USA and Britain. It is
over a complaint that Liberia is assisting the revolutionary United Front
rebels in Sierra Leone in exchange for diamonds. Liberia has denied this,
arguing that it has its own diamonds and has no interest in Sierra Leone's
diamonds.

It is critical that the coming Pan-African Parliament assists African
member states to solve their own affairs, instead of leaving them to the
Security Council. This council is still dominated by the five permanent
members, especially the USA and Britain. That is the reason it is so easy
to impose sanctions on the countries of the south than on those of the
north, examples being Libya and Iraq. [Interjections.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, electricians are sorting
out the power failure. We will suspend the debate.

An HON MEMBER: Should we not adjourn?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: No, we are not adjourning. [Interjections.]
This will take about two minutes. [Interjections.]

Business suspended at 18:51 and resumed at 19:01.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, another danger facing African countries, which
our Ministry of Foreign Affairs must take note of, is the dumping of toxic
waste on the African continent by Western countries. This dumping is a
health hazard and causes environmental damage. The alternative to
irresponsible dumping is clean technology. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs
must seriously pay attention to the dumping of toxic waste in African
countries, including our own country.

The PAC supports this Vote. The PAC wants to put on record that sanctions
on any country, particularly a developing country, punishes not the
government, but the ordinary citizens of that country, the women and
children, and exacerbates underdevelopment. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, Suid-Afrika is vanjaar die voorsitter van
die Onverbonde Beweging, die Nonaligned Movement. In daardie geledere is
dit 'n posisie van die hoogste aansien, en was in die tyd van mense soos
Nehru, Mev Ghandi en Maarskalk Tito inderdaad 'n baie gewigtige posisie.

Met sy leerstuk van 'n Afrika-renaissance probeer die agb President ook om
Suid-Afrika, veral ook wat Afrika betref, in 'n leiersposisie voor die hele
w√™reld te plaas. Dit is so dat Suid-Afrika en die hele Afrika leierskap
nodig het. Dit is so dat daardie leierskap uit Afrika moet kom en dat dit
Renaissance-leierskap moet wees wat sal lei tot herlewing.

Nou wil ons graag van die President en ook die Minister weet, waarheen
presies hulle Suid-Afrika lei. Sy leiding word tog in die eerste plek
weerspie√´l in die prioriteite van die Departement van Buitelandse Sake. Hoe
lyk daardie prioriteite? 'n Man word tog aan sy vriende geken. Vandag is
Suid-Afrika se vriende, in die o√´ van die hele w√™reld, mense soos die
Castros, die Ghaddafis en ander kommunisties-sosialistiese lande soos China
en Indi√´, die ou vriende van die struggle se dae. Soos die Oujaarsliedjie
lui: ``Sal ons ou vriende ooit vergeet ...''.

Die Minister van Buitelandse Sake het dit pertinent vroe√´r vanjaar, veral
met verwysing na Kuba, ges√™ ons het 'n ereskuld teenoor hulle, en dit lyk
vir my die agb Fidel van der Merwe stem daarmee saam. Wie geniet die
hoogste posisie in ons protokol? Wie was die laaste en tweedelaaste
staatsmanne wat die podium bestyg het met die President se inhuldiging?
Arafat en Ghaddafi.

Dit word hier plaaslik raakgesien en aangeteken en dra by tot die gevoel
van vervreemding wat baie van ons mense tans ervaar. Maar dit word nie net
hier ter plaatse opgemerk nie. Oral word verwys na Suid-Afrika se intiemste
vriende. En wanneer een van die ou vriende oortree en deur sy eie
egogedrewe paranoia sy land en die hele substreek die afgrond inlei, dan
maar liewer stille diplomasie, want 'n mens baklei mos nie met jou vriende
voor ander nie.

Daar is nog 'n verdere inkonsekwentheid waarop ek wil wys. Aan hierdie
vriende word meer regte toegeskryf as wat ons eie mense gegun word. In sy
verwelkoming van Jasser Arafat het Minister Kader Asmal Israel gekritiseer
oor ``sy ontkenning van 'n volk se reg tot nasieskap'' - 'n uitspraak
waaroor die Regering hom nou ook sal moet verantwoord teenoor die Afrikaner
in sy stryd om selfbeskikking.

Dit is duidelik dat hy in die geval van die Palestyne 'n volk beskou as 'n
bepaalde etniese eenheid met kollektiewe regte en aansprake. In die geval
van die Palestynse volk word hulle reg erken om as 'n volk bekend te staan,
regte uit te oefen en erkenning te geniet. Hy vra nie, in ooreenstemming
met die meeste van sy uitsprake, van Palestyne om maar net deel van die
meerderheid te word nie.

Hierdie klem op 'n volk se reg tot nasieskap moet verwelkom word. Hoekom
niks daarvan vir die onderskeie volke in Suid-Afrika nie? Daar is niks van
hierdie volkserkenning by die Minister en sy kollegas te bespeur as dit
gaan oor die regte van Afrikaners en ander gemeenskappe nie. Dit is ironies
dat hy die Palestyne 'n eie land gun, maar die Afrikaner nie eers sy eie
universiteit of 'n eie skool nie.
Ek is bevrees Suid-Afrika het tans net o√´ vir die onverbondes en dit
kategoriseer hom in geen onduidelike terme nie. En soos hulle sukkel, sal
Suid-Afrika sukkel. Dit, meer as enigiets anders, is die hoofoorsaak vir
die lae randwaarde, vir die onvermo√´ om beleggingskapitaal te bekom.
Beleggers sal altyd vir 'n mens s√™: Hoe nader jy aan sosialisme beweeg, hoe
skaarser raak die beleggings, want sosialisme is mot en roes wat verniel.
Die land se ekonomie ly daar onder. Ek pleit by die President en die
Minister om hulle te skaar aan die kant van hulle wat 'n rekord het van
gesonde vryemarkekonomie√´. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairman, this year South Africa is the Chair of the
Nonaligned Movement. In those ranks this is a position of the highest
respect, and was also, during the time of people like Nehru, Mrs Gandhi and
Marshall Tito, indeed a very significant position.

With his tenet of an African Renaissance the hon the President is making an
effort, specifically as far as Africa is concerned, to place South Africa
in a position of leadership before the whole world. It is true that South
Africa and the entire Africa require leadership. It is true that that
leadership must come from Africa and that it must be Renaissance leadership
which will lead to revival.

Now we would like to know from the President and the Minister exactly where
they are leading Africa. His leadership is indeed reflected in the first
instance by the priorities of the Department of Foreign Affairs. What are
those priorities? Surely one is known by one's friends. Today South
Africa's friends, in the eyes of the entire world, are people such as the
Castros, the Ghaddafis and other communist-socialist countries, such as
China and India. These are the old friends from the days of the struggle.
As the New Years' Eve song goes: ``Should old acquaintance be forgot ...''.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs said pertinently earlier this year,
especially with reference to Cuba, that we owed them a debt of honour, and
it seems to me as if the hon Fidel van der Merwe agrees with that. Who
enjoys the highest position in our protocol? Who were the last and the
second last statesmen on the podium when the President was inaugurated?
Arafat and Ghaddafi.

This is noticed and noted here locally and contributes to the feeling of
alienation that many of our people are experiencing at present. But this is
not just noticed here locally. Everywhere reference is made to South
Africa's most intimate friends. And when one of the old friends
transgresses and, because of his own ego-driven paranoia, leads his country
and the entire subregion to ruin, then it is better to follow quiet
diplomacy, because surely one does not quarrel with one's friends in front
of others.

There is a further inconsistency which I want to point out. These friends
are granted more rights than our own people. When he welcomed Yasser
Arafat, Minister Kader Asmal criticised Israel for ``denying a people its
right to nationhood'' - an utterance the Government will now have to
justify to the Afrikaners in their struggle for self-determination.

It is clear that in the case of the Palestinians he considers a people to
be a specific ethnic unit with collective rights and claims. In the case of
the Palestinian people their right to be known as a people, to exercise
their rights and enjoy recognition are acknowledged. He does not as he does
in most of his utterances, simply ask the Palestinians to become part of
the majority.

This emphasis on a people's right to nationhood is to be welcomed. Why then
is there none of this for the various peoples in South Africa? None of this
recognition of a people is to be detected in the Minister and his
colleagues when it concerns the rights of Afrikaners and other communities.
It is ironic that he allows the Palestinians to have their own country, but
he does not even allow the Afrikaners to have their own university or
school.

I am afraid that at present South Africa has eyes only for the non-aligned,
and this categorises the country in no uncertain terms. And as they
struggle, South Africa will struggle. That, more than anything else, is the
main cause of the low value of the rand, and the inability of the country
to obtain investor capital. Investors will always say: The closer one gets
to socialism, the scarcer the investments become, because socialism
destroys. The country's economy suffers the consequences. I am appealing to
the President and the Minister to side with those who have a record of
sound free-market economies.]

Mrs F MAHOMED: In the name of God, most gracious and most merciful.
Chairperson, colleagues and friends, I feel I have to respond to Mr
Aucamp's remarks. Our friends are the very people who supported us against
oppression and aggression, if he does not know, and they will remain our
friends for ever.

When one looks at the fossilised shells on the shores of our beautiful
country, one realises that history goes back more than 300 years. Our
country has gone through fundamental changes, from absolute isolation to
global integration. The six-year rule of the ANC-led Government is marked
by profound and substantial modification of the system of international
relations, technological progress and the emergence of a new generation.

Our interventions and negotiating skills on peace brokering has earned us a
special place in the New World Order. The NAM meeting concerning
Palestinian issues is only one such example. The recognition of equal
rights of all countries is vital. Therefore the principle of the domination
of major powers needs to be challenged.

We are indeed anxious that the UN regains its true pivotal and democratic
role in furthering the interests of the developing world. Justice for all
in the world is imperative. For example, the genocide and gross human
rights violations in Palestine must be addressed. International
institutions should take heed of the global problems without prejudice.

A shift in foreign policy that recognises economic development is crucial
and fundamental to realistic and pragmatic changes. The African continent
must and should be an image of democratic governance. Erratic efforts to
change the constitution without respect for the rule of law could have
disastrous effects on our development agenda. Developing countries deserve
the right to prosper and make socioeconomic progress. Harnessing and
developing our resource base, with a parallel effort towards collective
policy formulation, will boost and regenerate African economies.

Our President has constantly raised this issue at many summits. Our efforts
to compete on the global markets will help us realise our true potential as
South Africans. The recent South Africa-EU negotiations have taught us many
skills and created many challenges. The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act
of the United States has given us many opportunities to accelerate our
economic activity. At this juncture we need to commend the President of the
United States and hope that other developed countries will follow suit.

Every nation nurtures a dream of recovering its past to give a better focus
to its present and inspire the future. Colonialists tried to put chains in
our brains and exploited and enslaved our people by destroying their inner
strength and human dignity. But currently we are reclaiming our inherent
humanity by excavating our hidden histories, which restore the pride of our
nation, because without this effort we will continue to carry the
debilitating self-images and will militate against our positive
contribution to the global paradigm shifts.

Perhaps I should also mention to Mr Eglin that it is ironic that the DA
talks about damage control with regard to our country and its image. I wish
to advise him that the DP should actually reflect on their own patriotism,
as true diplomacy is not about point-scoring or party-politicking.

As Africans we need to promote a culture of peace and tolerance. We also
know that external forces resulting from colonialism cause instability,
civil wars and conflicts in Africa. This has impacted negatively on all
spheres of development. Regional institutions must be reviewed,
rationalised and reformed.

Our ability to recognise early warning signals is crucial, so that we are
able to find African solutions for Africa's security problems. It has been
proven that negotiated solutions provide sustainable and mutually
beneficial ways of resolving conflict. Good governance, human rights,
democracy, transparency and accountability could be reinforced if positive
values are inculcated into the international community. I am talking about
values such as dignified self-reliance, independence and acknowledgement of
development needs, towards a participatory democracy.

It needs to be noted that free trade should be regulated with equitable
implementation of multilateral trade rules which will make changes to the
one billion of the world's poorest of the poor. Reduction of debt is
crucial to an equitable New World Order. Clearly, most of these challenges
affect the lives of women.
I wish to make a few comments on the budget. As we are aware, the
department has requested additional funding amounting to R363 million to
reprioritise South Africa's foreign policy objectives. We are of the view
that fiscal shifts should take place, to achieve global competitiveness and
to achieve equality and participatory democracy. It needs to be noted that
new missions need to be opened. To increase our presence in Africa, it is
important to open missions in Rwanda, the DRC and Mali. Without the
monetary clout, the Department of Foreign Affairs cannot achieve its set
targets.

On another level, I wish to comment on the restructuring and transformation
of the department. I wish to congratulate the director-general and the hon
the Minister on transforming the department to a great extent. I believe
enough is not done regarding women's involvement in the higher echelons of
the department.

Some recent statistics have shown that only 16% of career diplomats are
women as compared to 84% of men. More opportunities should be made
available for women to participate and contribute positively to the
enhancement and implementation of foreign policy objectives. They should be
given a chance to acquire skills needed to engage in multilateral fora.
They should be part of the high-level negotiating teams wherever possible.
They also need to be trained to recognise conflict, and more money should
be spent on training women as heads of missions. At present the figure
stands at 19% as compared to 81% of men.

I want to say that it needs to be remembered that true democracy cannot be
achieved without an engendered democracy. [Applause.]

Mrs I MARS: Chairperson, Madam Minister, Deputy Minister and colleagues,
the Department of Foreign Affairs uses three budget programmes to achieve
its strategic priorities. These priorities broadly encompass the general
function of missions, with special reference to foreign investment,
international trade, tourism, building regional and international co-
operation and enhancing the image and understanding of South Africa's
foreign policy objectives.

Of these three programmes, foreign relations dominates the budget,
consuming an average of 72.5% over a seven-year period. This important
programme promotes relations with foreign countries and South Africa's
participation in international organisations and institutions such as the
UN, OAU, SADC and NAM. South Africa's bilateral relations focus on
sustainable development, peace and security, stability and co-operation and
public and economic diplomacy.

South Africa has become a leading player in Africa's regional conflicts in
terms of conflict resolution and has also ably responded to unforeseen
events such as the Mozambican floods. Multilateral relations, ie dealing
with our participation in global and regional institutions, has received an
increase of 22% and we can only hope that this will prove adequate.

There are likely to be further demands on the Foreign Affairs budget in
terms of the African Renaissance and the proposed African Parliament. In
this South Africa is one of the leading players and it is therefore
necessary to examine the financial implication. Everything we do in the
context of Africa is of vital importance. Africa's stability or lack
thereof impacts in every way on South Africa. Therefore we cannot spare
efforts to achieve stability and development throughout the continent. This
must be an absolute priority.
The bilateral relations budget has increased substantially due to the large
number of missions abroad, many of which are, unfortunately, subject to an
exchange-rate volatility and therefore reflect negatively on budgetary
provisions. We are pleased to note that the programme still reflects that
Foreign Affairs is taking control of foreign property. Hopefully, we shall
be able to acquire more properties abroad as, ultimately, this will prove
to be more cost-effective. As far as the 100 missions abroad are concerned,
we do have a question: Is the Department satisfied that they are producing
results in terms of the various policy objectives? Are cost-benefit
analyses done on a regular basis? If not, why not?

Other concerns are as follows: Firstly, the impact of income tax on foreign
service allowances. Obviously compensatory arrangements will have to be
made. How will this affect the Foreign Affairs budget? Secondly, the
progress made, or lack thereof, with the selection and training of the 50
new recruits. Thirdly, the training component, which appears to cater to a
large extent for head-office staff rather than personnel abroad. Fourthly,
the lack of capacity in our mission on the African continent to make
effective contributions to peace and stability, which is an absolute
priority.

I conclude by noting that the Minister, her Deputy and her department have
played a vital role in South Africa's re-entry into the international
community of nations, and we congratulate them. However, as the spotlight
of various international fora are fully on South Africa and much is
expected from us, the budget increases from 1997 to 2004 is below the
annual inflation rate. Therefore, the Foreign Affairs budget will show a
real decline in expenditure at a time when the demand on its services are
increasing. We all need to be concerned about this.

The IFP supports the Vote. [Applause.]

Dr Z P JORDAN: Mr Chairperson, translating ideas into reality is something
that is very easily stated, but not so easily achieved, and I shall try to
demonstrate this by talking about the very thorny problem of Zimbabwe.

In the discussions that the ANC has had with all the political parties in
Zimbabwe, we have warned against the dangers of subverting the rule of law.
We have warned that subverting the rule of law is more likely to impede
change by heightening tension and promoting lawlessness.

We have also, in the most unequivocal terms, warned that the reckless
actions of intimidation, thuggery, physical assault and murder committed by
government-supporting militias who claim to be war veterans, can only
damage the economy of that country and compromise the international
confidence Zimbabwe so badly needs, if it is to attract foreign investment
and foreign tourists.

We have also consistently appealed to the very values and norms that the
national liberation movement in Zimbabwe waged the struggle to attain. The
values of democracy, accountable government, the rule of law, an
independent judiciary, nonracialism, political tolerance and freedom of the
media - we have also pointed out that these things came to Zimbabwe with
the victory of the national liberation movement.

That we have done these things is a matter of public record. But in the cut
and thrust of political debate, the opposition would like to pretend that
this is not so. We understand. Perhaps that is the nature of politics.
What I would like to appeal for, though, in discussing our foreign policy,
especially in relation to the Southern African region, is reason. When we
discuss this region, let us be level headed and rational, because the
courses of action we advocate are very likely to have immediate effects -
effects that will find expression on our borders and in the streets of our
cities.

If it were possible to convince the government of another country to change
its course and follow our advice - good, bad or indifferent - merely by
offering newspaper editors a good headline, there would be no need for
diplomacy. Regrettably, the world is not that simple. The challenge we face
in Zimbabwe, as in the rest of the SADC region, is ensuring political
stability and economic growth. With those objectives in mind, South
Africa's task in Zimbabwe is assisting the people of that country to get
the economy back on an even keel.

Yes, former Minister Moyo has warned that the actions of the government in
which he recently served are undermining that purpose. We agree, and we
have said so. But having said that, do we then smugly fold our arms and
wait for Zimbabwe to unravel?
The options that the opposition would have the Government pursue are not
only unrealistic, they are unworkable. It might make some of us feel good
to ban Zimbabwean Ministers from travelling to South Africa, but what
effect would that have? Could South Africa, having done that, then expect
our Ministers to travel to Harare the following week to offer advice? Or
even to say the very rude things that Dr Boy Geldenhuys would like us to
say to President Mugabe?

Regrettably, there are those who think that precipitating economic collapse
in Zimbabwe will spur the fall of that government. But have they considered
what that would imply for the party that followed Zanu-PF as the
government?

Mhlalingaphambili, akukho lizwe lingazilandeliyo √Øzinto ezinomdla kuzo.
Kodwa, thina apha eMzantsi Afrika kuthiwa masenze kanye le nto iza
kusenzakalisa. Abathi masitshonise iZimbabwe, bathi masitshonise uMzantsi
Afrika. Abathi masivimbe iZimbabwe umbane, mabakhumbule ukuba loo nto iya
kubangela ukuba elo lizwe lihlale ebumnyameni. Mabakhumbule futhi ukuba
kanye lo mbane siwufumana eKariba udlula eZimbabwe apho. Abo bathi
masivimbe iZimbabwe amafutha eenqwelo mabakhumbule ukuba, nangani loo nto
iya ayisayi kuluphelisa uthontelwano ezigaraji, koko iya kwenza ukuba lube
ngakumbi. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, there is no country that does not follow up on things that
are of interest to it. However, here in South Africa we are told to do
exactly what would harm us. Those who tell us to sabotage Zimbabwe are
suggesting that we should sabotage South Africa. Those who say we should
cut the electricity supply to Zimbabwe must remember that that would cause
that country to live in darkness. They should also remember that the very
electricity that is supplied to us from Kariba passes through Zimbabwe.
Those who say that we should cut the fuel supply to Zimbabwe should
remember that although that would reduce congestion at our garages, it
would be because there would be no fuel in that country.]

We are repeatedly warned and told that South African diplomacy has failed.
That might or might not be the case. But have those who make that charge
considered that the diplomacy of White Hall and the US State Department has
been any more successful? Have the denunciations from London and Washington
saved a single life? Have they halted a single farm invasion? Have they
persuaded the Zanu-PF government to change its course? Well, the answer is
obvious. If what we are hearing is true, what is happening instead is that
these very same governments are now appealing to South Africa to assist
them in reopening avenues of communication with Harare.

Let us understand that diplomacy is not feel-good gestures. South Africa
today is not merely an active member of the international community, but is
also a highly respected one. We have achieved that by being true to
ourselves, by being an African country on the African continent. We have
used our chairmanship of the Nonaligned Movement not only to try and assist
in securing peace in the Middle East, but also to co-ordinate the
initiatives of developing countries of the south to meet the challenges of
globalisation.

In the Commonwealth, as one of the few multilateral institutions that
brings together developing and developed countries, it is universally
recognised that South Africa is punching way above its weight, and that we
are doing that despite the financial and personnel constraints our
Department of Foreign Affairs is facing.

We have heard numerous complaints about the regular absences of our Foreign
Minister. But when we measure the results her efforts have achieved for our
country and our continent, I would say those absences are very well worth
it. [Applause.] Even as we speak, the outcomes produced by South African
diplomacy are slowly unfreezing what seemed to be an intractable situation
in the lacustrine countries. Steady and consistent effort is persuading the
belligerents to disengage and foreign participants to be withdrawn. Our
Foreign Affairs Ministry has been at the centre of those developments.

The primary focus of our foreign policy, quite correctly, is on the African
continent. That is sound and will remain so. However, we should nonetheless
be alert to dangerous trends elsewhere that threaten to have a very adverse
effect on Africa and the rest of the world. A new arms race accompanied by
a cold war can only do us harm. I am certain that our Foreign Affairs
Minister will bring the concerns of our country and this House to the
attention of her US counterpart when they discuss these matters.

Having survived the second half of the 20th century under the constant
threat of nuclear war, it is of paramount importance that the 21st century
does not witness a rerun of that painful history. The ANC will support this
Vote. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Chairperson, I would really like to thank
everybody who has participated in this debate. Some have given very sound
advice and others have not done so, but they have made the debate lively. I
thank them for that.

For the ANC, I do not have a lot of time, so I cannot answer a lot of the
questions other than to say that, yes, I agree with many things the members
said, including that we must have proactive and not quiet diplomacy, and
that we must increase our missions in Africa. We need money to do that.
Indeed, it is true that we have fewer missions in Africa than Cuba has, as
the chairperson said. That is a true reflection of affairs. We do not like
that and we are trying to do our best. However, we need resources.

There was a question that I think I should answer, which was whether we
have resolved the question of the tax of our foreign diplomats. That matter
is still under discussion between the Treasury, Public Service and
Administration, ourselves and Sars. That matter is being discussed.

As for the questions about Zimbabwe and so on, I think I will not spoil the
good presentation the hon Pallo Jordan has just made. I think that that
answers those questions. Thus, I will not go back to that. Hon Mabeta asked
a few questions. Because of the limited time, I will maybe answer one and
answer the others at the cocktail party. He asked whether we have been in
touch with Zambia on the question of the third term and the changing of the
constitution.

On the question of translating our website into local languages, I think
that that is very good idea. They must give us resources and we will do it.

An HON MEMBER: But he will do it free of charge.

The MINISTER: He only knows Afrikaans. He will translate everything into
Afrikaans all over the world. Nobody speaks it. [Laughter.] He can only do
it in the Netherlands and maybe in Flanders and that would be it. He cannot
do it in the rest of the world. However, we do need resources to be able to
do that.
On the question of whether we are recruiting young people into the
Department of Foreign Affairs, I want to say to the hon Eglin, who has been
in this House for many years, that I am quite sure he can see that there
are new faces in Foreign Affairs. [Interjections.] He can see that there
are young, bright, vibrant new people in Foreign Affairs. It is very
obvious. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Sure, we may be using politicians as ambassadors, but what we would like to
do, as we are doing, is to recruit young people, ground them in the
department and then eventually send them abroad. [Interjections.] We are
recruiting. Hon members can see we have got bright sparks. I want to say to
the hon Eglin not to worry about that. [Interjections.] That answers the
hon Eglin. [Interjections.]

In terms of women, yes, I think we need to do more in terms of women
ambassadors. But when one considers where we started, we have done very
well. [Interjections.] We have close to 20 women ambassadors in very
powerful places. [Applause.] They are in places such as Washington, London,
Paris ...

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Havana. [Interjections.]
The MINISTER: Not yet, but maybe. [Laughter.]

And they are in places such as India, Poland and the Netherlands. We have
people in Malaysia. We have lots of women there. But this is not enough.
[Interjections.] It is not enough, and we are still going to send and
recruit more women. [Interjections.] Unfortunately Robben Island, I think,
will be stuck with only the hon Eglin or Mike Ellis. It will not be a
woman. [Laughter.]

In terms of our friends, I really do not think the hon Eglin was serious
when he said that we must join hands with him and be friends with him in
fighting Mugabe, in fighting President Castro, in fighting Cuba.
[Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: He never said anything of the sort.

The MINISTER: Why does he think we will go along with him? The hon Eglin
said we must condemn President Mugabe in public, and that the DA would
support us in that. [Interjections.] Why? Why should we do that?
[Interjections.] Why should we do that? Just to get their support? We do
not need their support. [Applause.] [Interjections.] We do not need their
support. We are doing just fine without it. [Interjections.]

I want to say thank you very much to Koos van der Merwe for answering a lot
of the nonsense that came from somewhere on this side. [Interjections.] I
want to thank the hon member very much. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon members! Can we give the Minister
the opportunity to reply to the questions? You have had your time.

Mr M J ELLIS: She is not doing very well. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER: Let me tell you, Mike Ellis, I am not going to talk to you.
You can go on with your coffin business. I am not about to talk about your
coffins or anything else. [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER: You have left your coffin business. Congratulations.
[Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: You made me give it up. I gave it up because you told me to.

The MINISTER: You gave it up? [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Because you told me to.

The MINISTER: Then I am sure you will support the health policies of this
country for a change ... [Laughter] Applause] ... because the health
policies of this country do not lend themselves to selling too many
coffins. [Interjections.] So that is very good. [Interjections.]

I am not going to worry about the other issues raised by people as to
whether or not we should be friends with Cuba. I am sure we are old enough
to choose our friends, to choose them well and to support what is just and
right for our country. We will continue to do that in the same way that we
delivered democracy, we delivered human rights ... [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: [Inaudible.] [Interjections.]

The MINISTER: ... to the world. That is why the hon Tony Leon can go
jumping around like a spoilt brat in all these countries, talking about how
badly South Africa is doing. [Interjections.] He thinks people appreciate
that.

People think he is mad. [Interjections.] I wonder why he is going around
telling everybody how badly South Africa is doing, when it is this very
Government that has allowed him the dignity to even show his passport in
public. Before that they could not even show their passports in public,
indicating that they were South Africans. They were hiding them, not
wanting them to be seen. We have, at least, given them some dignity to walk
tall and be proud that they are South Africans. So thanks for their advice,
but we will not take it. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 19:37.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry on Budget
     Vote 31: Trade and Industry, dated 27 March 2001:


     The Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry, having examined Budget
     Vote 31: Trade and Industry for the 2001-02 financial year, as well as
     the forward estimates for 2002-03 and 2003-04 included in the Estimates
     of National Expenditure, reports as follows:


     A.     Main features of Budget


         1. The Department is allocated R2¬†214,6 million for the financial
              year 2001-02, while forward estimates anticipate it receiving
              R2¬†465,1 million and R2¬†625,9 million in the years 2002-03 and
              2003-04, respectively. This compares to the R2¬†116,4 million
              voted in last year's Budget, which rose to R2¬†245,4 million in
              the adjusted appropriation for 2000-01. The Department's
              Budget for 2001-02 is broadly in line with last year's forward
              estimate for 2001-02 (which was R2¬†264,2 million), but the
              amount anticipated for 2002-03 represents an increase of 12,6%
              over last year's forward estimate for 2002-03, which was
              R2¬†332,2 million. The Department's Budget can thus be
              described as a constant Budget with minor fluctuations.


         2. The 2001-02 Budget is divided into five programmes, compared to
              the previous four. They are Programme 1 - Administration (4%
              of the total); Programme 2 - Trade, International Trade and
              Economic Development (1%); Programme 3 - Enterprise and
              Industry Development (46%); Programme 4 - Enterprise
              Organisation (34%); and Programme 5 - Trade and Investment
              South Africa (15%). The new programme structure arises
              directly from the restructuring of the Department and provides
              for better correspondence with the Department's major
              operational divisions.


         3. The Budget for Programme 1 is increased from R107,4 million in
              the adjusted appropriation for 2000-01 to R148,7 million in
              2001-02. This relates mainly to the establishment of a new
              Executive Management Unit in the Department.


         4. The Budget for activities falling under Programme 2 is
              increased from R23,4 million in the adjusted appropriation for
              2000-01 to R28 million in 2001-02. The main activitities
              budgeted for under Programme 2 are multilateral and bilateral
              trade negotiations, the promotion of African economic
              integration and the activities of the Commission for
              International Trade Administration (previously known as the
              Board for Tariffs and Trade).


         5. The Budget for Programme 3 is reduced from R955,4 million in
              the adjusted appropriation for 2000-01 to R835,8 million in
              2001-02. Programme 3 is the Department's largest programme and
              includes most of the Department's services and supply-side
              incentives to businesses, including its dedicated small
              business and black economic empowerment promotion programmes.
              85,5% of the expenditure under Programme 3 consists of
              transfer payments. The decrease in expenditure in the present
              budget year is largely due to the financial independence of
              the Competition Commission and the cessation of contributions
              to the National Empowerment Fund.


         6. Programme 4's Budget is increased from R819,7 million to R942,2
              million, with an anticipated further rise to R1¬†268,9 million
              in 2003-04. The most significant factor behind the expected
              increase in respect of this programme is the implementation of
              new investment incentives and industrial support measures.


         7. Programme 5's Budget decreases from R339,5 million to R259,8
              million. The main reason for this is expected reduced
              contributions to the Export Credit Reinsurance Fund.


         8. A feature of this year's Budget is the inclusion in the
              Estimates of National Expenditure of a table of "expected
              outputs" and "service delivery indicators" for Programmes 2 to
              5. A further simplified list of "deliverables" was also
              included in the presentation to the Committee by the Director-
              General. Together, these offer, for the first time, measurable
              targets against which the Department's actual performance can
              be assessed.


         9. Transfer payments account for 82,5% of the total Budget. A
              significant part of these transfer payments are made to
              associated "family institutions". There are now 18 public
              entities and three other bodies that report to the Minister of
              Trade and Industry. They now participate in regular meetings
              of the newly established Council of Department of Trade and
              Industry Institutions (CDTII).
         10.     There has been a welcome improvement in the Department's
              record on spending. The amount of the 2000-01 Budget not spent
              at the end of the financial year was R80 million, but could be
              reduced to R60 million if the National Treasury approves
              certain virement requests. This compares to the underspending
              of R600 million, more than a quarter, of the total Budget for
              1999-2000.


         The Committee had an opportunity to engage on budgetary issues
         with four of the Department's associated institutions - the
         Industrial Development Corporation, the Council for Scientific and
         Industrial Research, Ntsika and Khula. Highlights of these
         discussions are included below.


     B.     Industrial Development Corporation (IDC)


         1. The IDC aims "to be the primary driving force of commercially
              sustainable industrial development and innovation" through,
              inter alia, "identifying and supporting opportunities not yet
              addressed by the market". It is largely self-financing and
              pays dividends to its sole shareholder, the State.


         2. The IDC provided investment assistance of R4,2 billion (5,9% of
              the fixed investment in the South African economy) last year.
              It is also extensively involved in the SADC region, where it
              has 30 projects in nine countries.


         3. The IDC reported encouraging progress in its efforts to promote
              small and medium enterprise development as well as black
              economic empowerment. Over the past five years, it has shifted
              focus away from large capital-intensive projects. 42,3% of its
              total funding approved for projects last year went to small
              and medium-sized companies, compared to 11% in 1998. The
              proportion of approvals going to empowerment firms increased
              from 6% to 27% over the same period.


         4. The IDC remains financially strong, with assets of R17,4
              billion and a retained income last year of R631 million. It
              faces, however, a risk arising from its involvement in two
              poorly performing steel projects - Columbus and Saldanha. We
              were told that, worst-case scenario, the IDC could lose R4
              billion if Saldanha were to fail. The IDC's leadership are,
              however, engaged in a major effort to turn Saldanha Steel
              around, linked to a broader process of restructuring the South
              African steel industry.


     C.     Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)


         1. The CSIR provides scientific and technological support for
              industrial development. 60% of the CSIR's funds emanate from
              clients and contracts. They will receive R302,8 million from
              the government in 2001-02, while forward estimates anticipate
              this falling to R301 million in 2002-03, before rising to R312
              million in 2003-04.


         2. The CSIR reported that there was now a much improved working
              relationship with the Department. They participate in meetings
              of the CDTII, and now have a formal co-operation agreement
              with the Department.


         3. The CSIR indicated that there is a worrying trend towards
              declining private sector involvement in research and
              development (R&D). A number of key private sector facilities
              have been downsized, outsourced or moved offshore recently,
              including facilities at Plesseys, AECI, Anglo-American, De
              Beers, Dow Chemicals (previously Sentrachem), the Chamber of
              Mines, Fishing Industries Research and Iscor. While robust R&D
              work continues to be carried out by some private companies and
              parastatals (e.g. Sasol, Telkom and Eskom), this, we are told,
              is becoming "the exception rather than the norm". The last
              time South Africa's gross expenditure on R&D was measured, was
              in 1997, when the total expenditure was R4¬†013 million (0,69%
              of GDP). Approximately 50% of this was then financed and 55%
              was actually performed by business.


         4. Against this background, the CSIR delegation expressed concern
              at the trend towards progressively reducing government
              spending on R&D. They said that government spending on R&D now
              represented 0,34% of GDP, which was less than those in many
              developed countries (trading partners), and which placed us in
              the same league as Greece and Mexico. No comparative figures
              for developing countries were provided.


     D.     Ntsika Enterprise Promotion Agency


         1. Ntsika is seeking to refocus its activities. It considers its
              current mandate to be too broad, and wants to shift away from
              its current main activity of accrediting service providers to
              a demand-driven provision of particular services to small
              business.


         2. Five integrated programme areas are envisaged:


              (1) Supplier Development - aimed at developing capacity of
                  potential entrepreneurs and enhancing that of those
                  considering expansion.


              (2) Market Development - aimed at identifying potential market
                  opportunities for small business.


              (3) Business Linkages - promoting links to suppliers and
                  collaborative activity.


              (4) Policy Design - involving research on SMME development.


              (5) Business Generation - aimed at promoting Ntsika's
                  services.


         3. Ntsika is allocated R35 million in the current Budget, and it
              is anticipated that it will receive R50 million in 2002-03 and
              2003-04. Ntsika also plans to generate own funding and donor
              support to boost its available funding by a further R60
              million by 2004. The allocation this year represents a
              reduction on last year's allocation of R50 million in the main
              Budget, which rose to R50,750 million in the adjusted
              appropriation.


         4. Ntsika's long-term future depends on decisions still pending
              about the restructuring of small business support programmes
              by the Department.


     E.     Khula Enterprise Finance


         1. Khula's priority objectives for 2001-02 include
              recapitalisation as a matter of urgency, and formalising
              future capital and grant funding arrangements with the
              Department.


         2. Khula says that it needs R1,2 billion for recapitalisation over
              the next few years to support a somewhat expanded programme of
              activities. It plans to expand its business loans and its
              guarantee, equity fund and institutional support portfolio
              from R462,4 million at the end of 2000-01 to R662,9 million by
              the end of 2001-02. As a result of ongoing negotiations with
              banks, bank guarantees are expected to increase from R380,9
              million to R506,2 million. In terms of job creation/outreach,
              Khula expects to increase its impact from 198¬†912 persons/jobs
              at the end of 2002 to 254¬†483 by the end of 2004.


         3. Khula requested R200 million from the Department for
              recapitalisation during the 2000-01 financial year and
              received a total of R141 million. No provision is made in the
              present Budget for a contribution to Khula's recapitalisation
              - only for grant funding of R20 million. Various assurances
              have, however, been given by the Ministry that this matter
              will receive attention.


         4. The organisation suffered an operating loss of R25 million in
              2000, largely due to the collapse of two non-governmental
              retail finance institutions in which Khula had a R40 million
              exposure.


         5. Khula also indicated that it would be seeking exemption from
              taxation.


         6. It is still not certain that Khula-supported activities are
              sufficiently benefitting target groups in disadvantaged
              communities. Between 1998 and 2000, the guarantee programme
              received over 600 applications from white-owned businesses,
              compared to just over 400 from African-, 200 from Asian- and
              50 from Coloured-owned firms.


     F.     Comments


         The Committee on the 2000-01 Budget noted that ... "expected
         outputs have not been clearly indicated and quantified with the
         result that no real base to measure impact has been provided". We
         are pleased to note that there has been considerable improvement
         in this regard in the present Budget. As indicated above, included
         in the Estimates of National Expenditure and in a simplified form
         in the Director-General's presentation to the Committee is a list
         of expected "outputs" and "deliverables" from each of the main
         programmes. These are not always as quantified or measurable as we
         would like, but do provide a basis for regular monitoring of the
         performance of the Department. The Committee has for some time
         included in its programme periodically focused engagements with
         the Department, at which it requests, inter alia, a report on the
         Department's performance against the Budget. The Committee has
         indicated to the Director-General and the Department that in
         future interactions during the course of the present budget year,
         it will request periodic reports on the extent to which the
         "outputs" and "deliverables" identified in the two documents
         indicated above have been realised. This, we believe, will
         considerably enhance our oversight of the Department's work.


         The Committee notes that there is considerable improvement
         generally in budgeting and budgetary control by the Department.
         Programmes are more closely aligned to the major activities of the
         Department, more effective financial reporting and control systems
         are in place and, as indicated above, the trend evident in
         previous years of significant underspending seems to have been
         corrected.
         The Department continues to define its fundamental task and
         strategy as being to grow the economy, through -


         1. facilitating access to sustainable economic activity and
              employment;


         2. raising the level of investment;


         3. increasing market access;


         4. promoting a fair, efficient and competitive market place for
              businesses and consumers.


         Last year, the Committee was told that the Department had chosen
         to focus its various activities in 2000-01 on three key
         objectives:


         *  Promoting Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs);


         *  Empowerment;


         *  Investment.
         While we appreciate that the Department was preoccupied with
         restructuring last year, it is not clear to us that SMME promotion
         and empowerment have received the priority attention they should
         have. We appreciate and support the Department's position that
         SMME promotion and empowerment need to cease being "ghettoised"
         and need to become the focus of the activities of the Department
         as a whole. However, it seems to us that the restructuring
         exercise has not yet reached the point where it is clear which
         structures and individuals will give focused attention to these
         priority activities. The long-term future of Ntsika still has to
         be decided, although it is said in general that its activities
         will be drawn more closely towards those of the Department. This
         contrasts, for example, with Trade and Investment South Africa
         (TISA), where considerable progress has already been made in
         merging the former Investment South Africa (ISA) with the new
         structure. A strategy for the recapitalisation of Khula, linked to
         improved performance and focus, is also clearly urgently needed.
         It is the Committee's earnest hope that the creation of new
         structures to more effectively promote SMMEs and empowerment will
         receive urgent attention in this budget year.


         The Committee also draws attention to the following:


         (a)     The indication by the CSIR that there may be a reduction
              in involvement by private companies in research and
              development, is a cause for concern. Clearly this is a matter
              that requires further investigation. It also adds a new
              dimension to the debate on desirable targets regarding
              government support for parastatal institutions involved in
              science and technology, like the CSIR. The Committee plans to
              engage further on this matter, both with the Department and
              the CSIR.


         (b)     The IDC has a critical role to play in promoting
              industrial, SME and empowerment strategies. Significant
              progress has been made in advancing these objectives in recent
              years. The potential risks associated with the IDC's exposure
              to the problems associated with Saldanha Steel cannot be
              allowed to jeopardise its effectiveness in this regard. While
              the IDC leadership appears optimistic to be able to turn
              around Saldanha, it is clearly a matter that needs to receive
              the priority attention of the Department as well as the IDC.
