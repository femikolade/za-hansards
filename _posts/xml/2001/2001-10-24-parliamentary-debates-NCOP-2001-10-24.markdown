                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the increase in the number of cases of child pornography  under
       investigation;
  (2) further notes that most  Internet  child  pornography  sites  require
       credit card details before access is allowed;


  (3) welcomes the policy of at  least  one  credit  card  company  not  to
       authorise such transactions; and


  (4) calls on -


       (a)  all credit card companies to implement similar policies;


       (b)  Internet service providers to formulate a policy to identify and
           eradicate child pornography websites; and


       (c)  all South Africans to act to eradicate  child  pornography  from
           the Internet.

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  at  the  following
sitting of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the DP  wishes  to  congratulate  Agri  Wes-Cape  for  the
       initiative taken to set up a code of conduct for agriculture  in  the
       Western Cape - the first province to have such a code;


  (2) also notes that 32 organisations contributed to  the  development  of
       this code over the past two years, the monitoring and  implementation
       of which will be negotiated with interested and affected parties;


  (3) further notes that  in  the  preamble  of  the  code,  Agri  Wes-Cape
       ``understands that our conduct  has  consequences  for  the  economic
       growth, natural beauty, social stability and environmental  integrity
       of this province'' and ``wishes to heal the wounds and injustices  of
       our past'';


  (4) acknowledges that although the  significance  of  this  conduct  lies
       within the monitoring and implementation thereof, the DP calls on all
       the other provincial agricultural unions to follow this example; and


  (5) echoes the words of Adv Wallace A Mgoqi, ``history will  honour  Agri
       Wes-Cape''.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting  of
the House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its concern at the latest evidence  of  xenophobia  in  the
       Zandspruit informal settlement in Honeydew;


  (2) condemns the intolerance of South  African  residents  towards  their
       neighbours of Zimbabwean origin;


  (3) regrets the destruction of property and displacement of people; and


  (4) calls on all people involved to show restraint and  respect  for  the
       rights of others.

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I hereby wish to give notice  of  the  following
motion:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with regret Israel's defiance of the United States by rejecting
       its demands to pull back from  its  military  offensive  against  the
       Palestinian authority;


  (2) further notes that  such  action  will  jeopardise  efforts  to  find
       peaceful solutions to the Middle  East  conflict  and  will  increase
       tensions;


  (3) notes in great agony the constant use of  excessive  and  unwarranted
       force and extrajudicial killings by Israel;


  (4) therefore condemns Israel's invasion over the past  week,  which  has
       left 22 Palestinians dead, adding to the hundreds that have died; and


  (5) mourns the loss of all lives of all backgrounds and resolves that  we
       all stand up for justice for all people so that there  can  be  peace
       for both Palestinians and Israelis.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council -


   (1)      notes the meeting at Abuja for the successful implementation  of
         the New Africa Initiative;


   (2)      further notes the resolve to  end  Afro-pessimism  and  forge  a
         common development plan for the African Renaissance;


   (3)      commends our President for  his  initiative  in  developing  the
         Millennium Africa Plan; and


   (4)      further  congratulates  our  President  for  his  initiative  in
         achieving support from Britain, America  and  other  countries  for
         the New Africa Initiative.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                            BIOLOGICAL TERRORISM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council -


   (1)      recognises  the  real  threat  posed  by  biological  terrorism,
         particularly the use of anthrax;


   (2)      notes that the latest deaths from anthrax in the  United  States
         are of postal workers handling post destined for the  US  Congress;
         and


   (3)      calls on the South African Government to -


         (a)     take all  possible  steps  to  limit  the  risk  to  postal

                        SEX EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with concern,  the  escalation  of  sex  exploitation  in  South
           Africa, including child rape and child abuse;


       (b)  that approximately 180 children per  day  are  estimated  to  be
           abused and about 60 children raped per day;


       (c)  the serious growth  in  the  trafficking  of  children  for  sex
           exploitation, often dressed up as sex tourism; and


       (d)  with concern, that police do not recognise child trafficking  as
           a crime, but only abduction and kidnapping, with  almost  9  000
           cases being reported last year; and


  (2) calls upon the Government to  take  the  necessary  steps,  including
       introducing legislation, to counter the  appalling  exploitation  and
       abuse  of  our   children,   including   child   trafficking,   child
       prostitution and child pornography.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

           RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON INTERGOVERNMENTAL FISCAL REVIEW

Mnr J P GELDERBLOM (Wes-Kaap): Voorsitter, ek wil met 'n  ander  se  kalwers
ploeg en hom nie woordeliks aanhaal nie, maar president John  F  Kennedy  se
woorde is tog van kardinale belang. ``It was not the economy that built  our
roads, but the roads that built the American economy.''

Soos in verskeie ander provinsies  het  ons  ook  al  jare  lank  'n  beleid
waarvolgens padprojekte se haalbaarheid en  doeltreffendheid  aan  die  hand
van sosio-ekonomiese ontledings beoordeel word. Dit wil sê die voordeel  vir
die provinsie se mense en die land in sy geheel  word  bepaal.  Die  jongste
analitiese stelsels sluit in sagteware wat deur die Wêreldbank  as  geskikte
maatstaf aanvaar word. Daarná eers word die finansiële haalbaarheid van  ons
padbouprojekte nagegaan.

Uiteraard is die stelsels wat  met  besluitneming  oor  projekprioritisering
help, nie die uiteinde van die  saak  nie.  Konsultasie  met  die  plaaslike
gemeenskappe is seker die belangrikste faktor wat in ag geneem moet word.

Vir  projekte  waar  sosiologiese  aspekte  aandag  verg,   word   bykomende
maatstawwe soos die armoedsvlakke en werkloosheidsyfers  in  die  gebied  in
die matriks ingebou  om  die  geskiktheid  van  sulke  projekte  te  bepaal.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J P GELDERBLOM (Western  Cape):  Chairperson,  I  want  to  plough  with
another man's heifer and not  quote  him  verbatim,  but  President  John  F
Kennedy's words are nevertheless of cardinal importance. ``It  was  not  the
economy that built  our  roads,  but  the  roads  that  built  the  American
economy.''

As in various other provinces, for years we have had a policy  in  terms  of
which road projects' viability and effectiveness  are  judged  according  to
socioeconomic analyses. This means to say that the advantage for the  people
of the province and the  country  as  a  whole  is  calculated.  The  latest
analytical systems include software that is accepted by the World Bank as  a
suitable yardstick. After that the financial viability of our  road-building
projects is determined.

Of course the  systems  that  assist  with  decision-making  in  respect  of
project prioritisation are not the end of the matter. Consultation with  the
local communities is certainly the most important factor that must be  taken
into consideration.

In respect  of  projects  in  which  sociological  aspects  need  attention,
additional yardsticks such as poverty levels  and  unemployment  figures  in
the area are built into the matrix in order to determine the suitability  of
such projects.]

However, all the analyses in the world and  establishing  a  list  of  high-
priority projects will get us nowhere if we are unable to channel the  right
funding firstly to the maintenance of our existing road networks;  secondly,
to upgrading them and last, but not least, to areas  of  sociological  need.
In the Western Cape, our agricultural  and  tourism  sectors  are  of  vital
importance to the economy, and the  infrastructure  to  support  these,  and
other industries, is vital.

Rural development is a high priority for the provincial government and  this
needs infrastructural support. The provincial government also places a  high
priority on the use of public transport for commuters  in  the  urban  areas
and for the support of rural development. Without a good road network, road-
based public transport cannot operate successfully.

In the effort to maintain what we have,  the  Western  Cape  government  has
placed  special  emphasis  on  the  containment  of  overloading  of   heavy
vehicles. A series of contracts is  being  issued  in  terms  of  which  our
weighbridges will operate for 16 to 24 hours a day. We are hoping that  SMME
firms will as heavily involved in this venture as they will  be  in  various
other projects.  Poverty-relief  funding  for  transport,  most  of  it  not
managed by  the  provincial  government,  will  also  help  to  provide  job
opportunities.

As politicians, though, we would be failing in our  duty  and  it  would  be
irresponsible of us to do nothing of consequence about a road  network  that
is tending towards old age  and  where  walking  sticks,  hearing  aids  and
operations are all coming too late to save faculties that  could  have  been
saved with timely interventions.

In die Wes-Kaap is ons diep dankbaar vir die  nasionale  infrastruktuurfonds
en die toekennings daaruit, al is dit gering. Dit is belangrik sodat ons  'n
doeltreffende padnetwerkstelsel kan bewerkstellig.

In die provinsie se beleid soos uiteengesit in die Witskrif oor Vervoer  van
1997, word bepaal dat ons ons voertuiglisensies na meer  realistiese  vlakke
verhoog en sodoende die moontlikheid van nuwe  programme  inbring.  Ons  het
die hoogste tariewe in die land, maar dit is met 'n spesifieke doel.

In die Wes-Kaap het  ons  ook  'n  tolpadwet.  Chapmanspiek,  wat  tans  vir
verkeer gesluit is, is 'n moontlikheid.  Tolgeld  sal  egter  na  verwagting
slegs help om paaie te herstel, dit sal geensins 'n inkomstestroom  vir  die
provinsiale regering genereer nie. Dit is net  nog  'n  belasting  waaronder
die mense gebuk gaan.

Ná 'n nat winter  in  dele  van  die  Wes-Kaap  is  die  teerpaaie  van  die
provinsie  en  dié  van  stadsrade  aan  die  verbrokkel.  Ons  hoër   order
gruispaaie het 'n gemiddelde dikte van 42 millimeter gruis terwyl ons  graag
'n minimum gruislaag van 50 millimeter sou wou hê. Voertuie sit vas  in  die
hoofpaaie wanneer die kors breek.

Met al die bogenoemde bronne in ag geneem, is die  totale  jaarlikse  bedrag
wat vir die  administrasie  en  instandhouding  van  die  hoër  order  paaie
beskikbaar is, sowat R350 miljoen. Ons het jaarliks ten minste R800  miljoen
nodig om die agteruitgang te stuit, om nie van agterstande uitwis  te  praat
nie.

Die agterstand in instandhouding van provinsiale paaie is tans R1,3  miljard
en die 20 000 en meer kilometer van laagste order paaie is dan nog nie  eens
in berekening gebring nie. Dit het 'n uiters nadelige invloed  op  landelike
ontwikkeling in die Wes-Kaap. Eise is aan die instroom vir voertuie  wat  op
ons  swak  paaie  beskadig  word.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[In  the  Western  Cape  we  are  deeply  appreciative   of   the   national
infrastructure fund and the allocations made from it, even though  they  are
negligible. It is important so that we can build an effective  road  network
system.

The policy of the province, as expounded in the White Paper on Transport  of
1997,  provides  that  we  should  raise  our  aeroplane  licences  to  more
realistic  levels  and  in  so  doing  introduce  the  possibility  of   new
programmes. We have the highest tariffs in the  country,  but  this  is  the
case for a specific purpose.

In the Western Cape we also have a law in respect of toll  roads.  Chapman's
Peak, which is at present closed to traffic, is a  possibility.  Toll  fees,
however, are only expected to help with road repairs, they would not in  the
least generate revenue for the province. It is just another tax  burden  the
people will have to bear.

After a wet winter in parts of the Western Cape  the  tarred  roads  of  the
province and those of town councils  are  disintegrating.  Our  higher-order
gravel roads have an average depth of 42 millimetres  of  gravel,  while  we
would like then to have a  50-millimetre  thick  minimum  layer  of  gravel.
Vehicles get stuck in the main roads when the crust breaks.

Taking all the aforementioned sources into consideration, the  total  annual
amount available for the administration and maintenance of the  higher-order
roads is about R350 million. We annually require at least  R800  million  to
arrest deterioration, not to mention eliminating backlogs.

The backlog in the maintenance  of  provincial  roads  is  R1,3  billion  at
present and the 20 000 and more kilometres of lowest-order  roads  have  not
even been taken  into  consideration.  This  has  an  extremely  detrimental
effect on rural development in the Western Cape. Claims are streaming in  in
respect of vehicles that are damaged on our poor roads.]

I repeat that we as responsible politicians must ensure not  only  that  the
fiscal policy provides the framework within which our officials can  operate
to preserve and extend the infrastructure that is so vital  to  the  economy
of the country, but also provide the resources. [Applause.]

Mr S M A  MALEBO  (Free  State):  Ke  a  leboha  modulasetulo.  [Thank  you,
Chairperson.]

Chairperson, the state of our roads  has  deteriorated.  This  deterioration
has a very negative impact on the performance of our economy and its  growth
and on service provision by Government.

A recent assessment puts about  60%  of  our  roads  in  the  ``very  poor''
category. This high  percentage  is  not  because  of  the  effects  of  the
democratic Government. There are about  four  major  reasons  why  our  road
network has deteriorated so badly: firstly, as a result of neglect over  the
years. From 1975 to the year  2000  the  infrastructure  budget  experienced
serious cuts.  The  budget  cuts  meant  that  roads  were  not  maintained,
resealed or rehabilitated, as required, in a cycle of once in every  six  to
seven years. This neglect has resulted in  a  major  backlog  regarding  our
main roads. The 60% or more bad roads in our road network is the  result  of
underbudgeting. This statement is true for both gravel and tarred roads.

Secondly, the lack of resealing and rehabilitation of our major roads is  as
a result of a lack of funds and of the effort that  is  required  to  ensure
that we protect our investment regarding our infrastructure.

Today the backlog stands at R2,9 billion, and it requires an  allocation  of
at least R638 million per year, plus an additional R60 million  for  current
maintenance, whilst the replacement value of the paved road network  in  the
province stands at R8,6 billion. For regravelling we need about R77  million
for a stretch of 752 km in order to address that backlog.  For  the  current
maintenance budget we need about R146 million annually.  Quite  clearly,  at
the moment, as a province and as a country, we cannot afford  the  kinds  of
allocations that I am speaking of because of the various competing needs  of
our people.

The biggest enemy of our road infrastructure is overloading  on  our  roads.
The damage to our infrastructure caused by a vehicle that carries twice  the
permissible axle weight is 16 times higher than that  caused  by  a  vehicle
with the allowable axle weight.

The serious challenge, therefore, is that  unless  we  work  on  a  plan  to
address the situation of our infrastructure, we will not  be  able  to  cope
with the economic growth that we are all  striving  for.  Instead,  we  must
expand our existing infrastructure if it is to cope with our  annual  growth
rate of traffic that is estimated at between 4% and 6%.

A road that required resealing in 1998 at R140 000  would,  if  it  was  not
done then, require at least R740 000 for resealing two years  later.  If  no
resealing was done at that stage, that road would have to  be  rehabilitated
totally. The cost would then be R2,2 million. From this we can see that  the
damage of our roads, or lack of maintenance of our infrastructure, has  very
negative effects for all of us. But this is felt more in the economy and  in
the service of Government.

I want to illustrate this by saying that we find the  effects  of  that  bad
road infrastructure when we look at the rate of accidents,  which  increases
annually as a result of bad road surfaces. It is estimated  that  about  15%
of our total road accidents are as a result of the bad road top surfaces  of
our roads. We should remember that accidents cost our  economy  R10  billion
annually, in other words 15% of that is what we are paying as  a  result  of
bad roads.

The cost of vehicle maintenance  increases  dramatically,  for  example  the
health authorities complain that because of the bad roads their  maintenance
for ambulances that run on those roads is four times higher than  for  those
ambulances that run on good roads. The general  public  also  complain  that
their spending on the maintenance of their vehicles  increases  dramatically
when they drive on bad roads. Therefore, it is quite clear  that  unless  we
attend to our road infrastructure the cycle  of  poverty  will  continue  to
increase.

It has been proven that every R1 that is spent on our roads  has  a  sixfold
multiple effect on society. Put differently, for every R1 that we spend,  we
can realise about six times that R1 as savings in  the  economy.  Therefore,
the best strategic spending for us as Government, and as a  country,  is  in
the infrastructure. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  MECs  present,  hon  special
delegates and hon colleagues, after the first democratic elections in  South
Africa, in April 1994, there was great expectancy among all South  Africans,
especially those, to use an Americanism, who lived  across  the  tracks,  in
other words the large mass of disadvantaged and deprived South Africans.

With apologies to Julie Andrews and ``The Sound of Music'',  not  only  were
the hills alive with the sound of music  in  celebration  of  our  new-found
democracy, but our hills and valleys and mountains  became  alive  with  the
sound of high expectancy, of delivery and empowerment among  the  previously
downtrodden citizens of our land.

To the credit of the Ministry  of  Transport,  both  the  hon  the  Minister
present and his erstwhile predecessor, the hon Mac Maharaj, have  evinced  a
keen appreciation of the imperatives of these two  buzz  words  of  the  new
democracy: delivery and empowerment.

For delivery to be realistic, the Department of Transport's crucial role  is
obviously to create the enabling conditions for empowerment to  ensure  that
urban and rural access to markets and work opportunities are opened up.  The
responsibilities of the Ministry include not only  the  opening  up  of  new
access roads to millions of  our  previously  disadvantaged  citizens,  but,
more importantly, to maintain existing infrastructure so that the wheels  of
the economy keep turning.

Enhanced mobility for our rural communities, through a combination  of  road
infrastructure  upgrade  and  integrated  transport  service  provision,  is
paramount if all South Africans are expected to play their rightful role  in
opening up  access  to  the  rural  markets  and  employment  opportunities,
especially in areas such as agriculture, tourism,  roads,  construction  and
welfare services.

South Africa has  one  of  the  most  extensive  road  networks  in  Africa,
extending over 500 000 km. All three spheres of government play  a  role  in
managing the maintenance, rehabilitation and development of this network.

Unfortunately a large portion of our roads are still the  old  gravel  roads
and, unfortunately again, these happen to be  mostly  in  the  rural  areas.
This is a problem area, especially in the aftermath  of  disasters  such  as
floods. Old people and the sick are marooned, unable to  visit  the  clinics
or hospitals or collect their pensions or grants. Children are cut off  from
schools and generally community life becomes frozen.

The Government receives some R26  billion  annually  in  taxes  and  licence
fees, yet the Government spends only R3,9 billion on roads,  despite  a  R23
billion backlog in road maintenance and infrastructure development.

The R26 billion paid by road  users  every  year  comes  from  the  levy  on
petrol, toll fees, licence fees, traffic fines, roadworthy certificates  and
vehicle registration fees, which approximates to  about  12%  of  Government
expenditure. National and provincial governments could be liable  for  about
R3,6 billion in damages for accidents, according  to  the  Southern  African
Bitumen  Association's  researchers,  as  quoted  in  last  week's  Mail   &
Guardian, 19 to 25 October, in a report on the roads in South Africa.

A recent High Court ruling found that  in  terms  of  the  Constitution  the
authorities are civilly liable for any accident caused by  preventable  road
defects. Government underspending, therefore,  could  prove  costly  in  the
long run. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr P G MASUALLE (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, hon members of the  House,  the
hon the Minister present here, I am particularly  honoured  and  pleased  to
participate on behalf of the province in this important debate. Up front  we
would want to commend those who put together the document  and,  indeed,  we
want to express our appreciation for the manner  in  which  this  was  dealt
with in the committee.

Road and transport infrastructure is a necessary condition  for  sustainable
development and economic growth.  This  indeed  holds  true  in  very  stark
proportions  in  our  province.  I  want  to  make  reference  here  to  the
provincial fiscal framework in the consolidated document, which  deals  with
the way forward. This is A.2 in the document, and I quote:


  The historical distribution of resources along racial lines  resulted  in
  provinces with vastly different economic and demographic profiles.  These
  differences affect the  demand  for  services,  the  ability  to  provide
  services, the skills base of provincial governments and their capacity to
  generate revenues.

I may add that this dichotomy holds true  even  within  the  confines  of  a
province, in this instance our own  province.  In  the  domain  of  critical
infrastructure we are experiencing this directly and daily. We do  not  read
about this in newspapers; it is an experience that we live through daily.

The notion that was once depicted very  succinctly  and  accurately  by  the
President of the country is the notion of two nations. We want to  make  the
point here that despite the  enormous  strides  -  and  I  want  to  repeat,
enormous strides - that have been made and recorded since  1994,  it  is  no
exaggeration to note that there are still communities in our  province  that
are totally inaccessible by  road  and  this  a  consequence  not  of  their
choice.

Resulting from systematic neglect  and  impoverishment,  we  are  confronted
with huge backlogs that cannot possibly be met in the short to medium  term.
Recent studies have revealed that 89%  of  villages  in  the  province  need
access roads, and in Transkei alone there  are  more  than  6 000  of  those
villages where this can be found.

We appreciate the opportunity in that we can  now  collectively  take  stock
and really assess the impact that we have made. Looking at the  MTR  figures
of the recent past, one can see that until this year, the  total  allocation
for roads has been dropping substantially since the 1997-98 financial  year.
Of course, we are mindful and aware of this in the province, because it  has
been necessitated by a variety of  competing  needs  in  which  very  bitter
choices had to be made.

This resulted in a massive  drop  in  operational  expenditure  and  further
exacerbated  the  backlog  situation  in  the  province  as  it  relates  to
maintenance, upgrading and development of our road network.

Estimates are that we would have needed in the order  of  R1,2  billion  per
annum only to keep the  existing  road  infrastructure  in  good  condition,
without developing it any further. This, I am afraid I  have  to  say,  does
not take into account the many villages I have referred to that  still  need
access roads, that is those villages that through  systematic  neglect  were
never built roads in the previous regimes.

We have put in place a 10-year  plan  that  is  fashioned  on  a  particular
funding scenario and, unfortunately, it does appear that there  is  still  a
deficit between the identified needs and the actual  budgets  available.  In
terms of this approach,  we  would  need,  consistently,  an  amount  of  on
average R2 billion, which would see us able to maintain and  indeed  develop
the network. It is imperative therefore that this trend  that  is  beginning
to emerge of consistent and increasing funding is maintained to ensure  that
lifelong investment in our road infrastructure is secured.

It is our contention that the institutional arrangements  that  support  the
provision of this critical function need to be looked  at  afresh.  Existing
legislation, with all its  good  intentions,  would  appear  to  unwittingly
militate against a well-co-ordinated and focused attack on  this  historical
legacy.

The provision of the infrastructure grant is  bringing  about  hope  and  is
demonstrating that we are beginning to give prominence to  this  fundamental
challenge. We want here to posit that it would indeed  be  helpful  if  this
kind of grant were to  continue,  but  given  the  situation,  as  correctly
mapped out  in  the  review  document,  to  which  I  referred  to  earlier,
particular emphasis must be placed on the backlog component when we look  at
the provinces as we have been doing.

In conclusion, we again welcome this opportunity and we would wish for  more
interaction with the National  Council  of  Provinces  on  matters  of  this
nature. I was a bit taken aback listening to  some  of  the  speakers  here,
because I had referred to us living with these  things,  not  reading  about
them in newspapers. It is  the  reality  that  there  are  areas  which  are
completely inaccessible, and that is as a  result  of  years  and  years  of
neglect. It is quite surprising to expect that within  the  period  of  time
that we have been in Government we would have removed  all  those  backlogs.
[Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I would like to thank the National  Treasury  for
this year's issue of  the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review,  which  mainly
focuses on outputs and service delivery by provinces and  municipalities.  I
would also like to thank the hon MEC of  the  Free  State,  Mr  Malebo,  for
being here today and for his submission to the select committee.

According to the  review,  provincial  expenditure  on  road  infrastructure
increased significantly over  the  past  three  years  since  1998  in  some
provinces only, such  as  KwaZulu-Natal,  the  Eastern  Cape,  the  Northern
Province and Mpumalanga, which received additional  allocations  to  address
flood damage. For the rest, spending on roads  has  been  sluggish  and  the
real average annual growth in provincial spending on roads was only 1,1%.

I am, however, sad to say that in the Free State there  was  no  growth.  On
the contrary, spending on national and  provincial  roads  declined  by  22%
from R240 million in 1998, to R180 million in 2000.  It  is  estimated  that
the actual spending in 2001 will only be R165 million, with the result  that
the road network in the Free State is deteriorating dramatically.

According to the hon MEC, the percentage of poor  -  as  we  heard  him  say
today - and very poor tarred and gravel roads has increased since 1991  when
only 25% was in poor condition compared to nearly 60% at present.

According to the review, the estimated total backlog in road  infrastructure
in South Africa is R23 billion. More than R10 billion per annum is  required
to address the backlog over five years. The estimated backlog  in  the  Free
State alone is R3 billion,  and  more  than  R600  million  is  required  to
address the backlog. One of  the  main  reasons  for  the  build-up  of  the
backlog given by the hon MEC here today is the  declining  budget  for  road
maintenance. It has decreased drastically from 1975 and reached an  all-time
low of R147 million in the year 2000.

I want to repeat, the annual need in the Free State to address  the  backlog
is more than R600 million, but the total amount allocated  to  the  province
the previous year for road maintenance was only R147 million. No wonder  the
poor MEC for roads and transport indicated with sadness  in  his  submission
that the backlog has now resulted in an old crumbling road  network  in  the
Free State that requires far  more  maintenance  than  can  be  provided  or
afforded. I am afraid that somewhere something is terribly wrong.

I am grateful to learn from the report that as from next year  supplementary
infrastructure conditional grants will be allocated  to  provinces.  But  it
can only be a solution if the share of the grant  earmarked  for  provincial
roads equals the amount that is needed by provinces to successfully  address
their backlogs. [Applause.]

Ms B THOMSON: Madam Chair, hon Minister, MECs present and  hon  members,  we
thank the Minister of Transport, his senior officials and the  MECs  present
for  attending  the  public  hearings.  We  certainly  had  insightful   and
illuminating discussions.

Four issues, amongst others, were brought  to  our  attention.  Firstly,  we
refer  to   the   institutional   arrangements   for   road   infrastructure
development.  During  the  public  hearings  we  were  informed  that   road
development is disaggregated as a national, provincial or  local  government
responsibility.

Current institutional arrangements are  inadequate  to  further  develop  or
build new roads because  the  capitalisation  of  national,  provincial  and
rural access minor roads further  complicates  road  upgrading,  maintenance
and building. However,  the  recently  introduced  National  Land  Transport
Transition Act addresses this concern. Section 10  outlines  the  principles
for the establishment of transport authorities for transport areas.

The legislation states that transport authorities  may  be  established  for
transport areas by written founding agreements between the MEC and a  single
municipality. The Act further stipulates that transport authorities  may  be
established if their object is to improve transport service delivery in  the
local sphere of government by grouping transport  functions  into  a  single
well-managed and focused institutional structure.

The Select Committee  on  Transport  should  monitor  the  progress  of  the
formation of transport authorities and should report back to the NCOP at  an
appropriate time. In other words, the Select Committee on  Transport  should
assess what progress the Department of Transport has  made  in  establishing
new institutional arrangements  for  road  infrastructure  development.  The
real issue is whether our  institutional  arrangements  are  appropriate  to
ensure that money budgeted for roads is aptly spent.

The  second  issue  I  wish  to  raise  refers  to  alternative  modes   and
intermodular forms of transport. The Minister stated that most  poor  people
use  minibus  taxis  for  their  transport  needs.  It  could  therefore  be
construed that the benefit of bus subsidies does not  reach  the  poor.  The
department is currently reviewing the issue of subsidies.

We also heard that  the  department  is  keen  to  promote  the  concept  of
intermodular forms of transport with  special  emphasis  on  commuter  rail.
This implies the levelling of the field between the road and rail  forms  of
transport. In this light,  commuter  rail  is  being  restructured  and  its
recapitalisation requirements are being addressed.

A capital expenditure programme was initiated to renew aging  rolling  stock
to enhance safety levels. Metrorail coaches have also been  upgraded.  Major
upgrading was done at Johannesburg's Park  Station  and  72  other  stations
across South Africa.

The  MECs  also  eloquently  argued  in  favour  of  alternative  forms   of
transport.  The  recent  introduction  of  the  Pedal  Power  programme  for
bicycles in their provinces marks the beginning of a new era  in  the  short
distance mode of transport. This development is consistent  with  the  Shova
Lula national bicycle transport programme.

The MECs expressed concern that it is often  not  only  cars  that  are  not
roadworthy, but some roads that may not be vehicleworthy.

The third issue refers to the slowness of cash  flow.  Several  MECs  argued
that, during post-disaster periods, road reconstruction  could  not  proceed
smoothly primarily because  of  the  delay  in  financial  relief  from  the
National Treasury. In fact, financial  aid  only  arrives  a  year  after  a
disaster has taken place.

In addition, provincial departments of transport were informed of  financial
relief only  on  the  eve  of  arrival,  thereby  making  prior  expenditure
planning an impossible task.

The members of the Select Committee on Transport would be keen to  hear  the
views  of  the  National  Treasury.  Members  of  the  Select  Committee  on
Transport also heard that roads and  infrastructure  are  Government  assets
and therefore any policy  that  favoured  the  building  of  new  roads  and
infrastructure  at   the   expense   of   maintaining   existing   ones   is
inappropriate.

This approach will lead to a decay of existing Government assets  while  new
assets are brought on board. This policy design  will  not  produce  maximum
utilisation of financial resources.  The  point  was  also  made  that  road
reconstruction, building or upgrading should be based on the  needs  of  the
provincial economy.

The maintenance costs of  roads  produce  a  higher  return  throughout  the
economy. However, we are  mindful  that  the  failure  to  extend  roads  to
neglected areas has equity implications. This may be construed as  a  catch-
22 situation, but clearly a balancing act is required.

Before I conclude, I would like to refer to the debate which deals with  the
contribution of maximum loads to the  destruction  of  our  roads.  We  were
informed that South Africa has the second highest maximum  load  permissible
in the SADC region. This begs the  question,  ``What  is  the  maximum  load
permissible on our roads?''

I look forward to the views of the Minister on whether excess  loads  damage
our road surface. [Applause.]

The  MINISTER  OF  TRANSPORT:  Madam  Chair,  hon  MECs   present,   special
delegates, members of the NCOP, it is a privilege to be here  today  and  to
participate in this discussion.

Initially I had fears that  this  may  turn  out  to  be  just  a  complaint
session, but I am very pleased that it was not. In fact, the  provinces  who
reported did so in a  positive  way.  They  identified  their  problems  and
indicated what they are doing and what they are trying to  do.  It  is  very
clear to me that provinces desire  to  work  in  partnership  with  national
Government and, of course, also with local government so as to  ensure  that
we address this problem of infrastructure development and  maintenance.  All
of us consider infrastructure maintenance to be extremely important. I  want
to give the House the assurance that I myself see their  inputs  in  a  very
positive light. I welcome the inputs that they have made  and  the  concerns
which they have expressed. I have ensured  that  a  senior  official  of  my
department is here with me, so that we  can  note  the  concerns  raised  by
provinces. As the House knows, the senior  official  from  the  Treasury  is
also here and so, at national Government level, we do regard this  issue  as
being extremely important.

I would just like to make a remark or two about one or  two  of  the  issues
raised. The first is the question of liability  for  damages  which  may  be
sustained on our roads because of failure to maintain them. It is true  that
there is the possibility of claims being instituted  for  bad  roads  -  for
example, potholes have caused damage to vehicles and to people.  Because  of
our constitutional arrangement, all three  levels  of  government  may  find
themselves subject to claims of that kind. It is a  problem  which  we  must
all address together.

At the same time, I think we must  be  very  careful  when  we  speak  about
liability. There is no absolute liability. Liability has always  existed  in
South African law, and not just because of the  Constitution.  I  think  our
Constitution confirms what our legal position has always been. In  our  law,
there is liability for acts of omission, ie when one  fails  to  do  certain
things. That is what we are talking about. However,  that  liability  arises
out of prior commission. So if one builds a road and one does  not  maintain
it, potholes develop or dangers are  created,  and  as  a  result  of  that,
certain things happen which cause damage, then  liability  arises  as  well.
There is no absolute liability.

And whilst I welcome a report from Sabita and  the  attention  that  it  has
given to the question of possible liability, those claims are  often  highly
exaggerated, although that does not mean  that  we  must  not  address  that
issue. We must most certainly do so.

I want to make  just  a  few  overall  remarks.  If  we  look  at  ourselves
together, then, between six and seven years of democracy, we observe ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Order!  I  apologise,  Minister.  The  service
staff keep  approaching  the  Table  while  the  Minister  is  speaking  and
therefore  distract  us.  If  that  could  not  happen,  please.   Continue,
Minister.

The MINISTER: I also apologise for not ignoring it, but it is  difficult  to
ignore at times.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: It is very difficult.

The MINISTER: Thank you very much, Chair.

I think that if we look at ourselves over the past few years, then  we  will
see that in the first six  years  of  democracy  we  did  not  pay  adequate
attention to the question of infrastructure.  In  as  far  as  transport  is
concerned - our roads and other transport infrastructure - there were  many,
many competing demands. For example, a great deal of attention was  paid  to
the  building  of  schools,  and  health  requirements  and   infrastructure
development there.

In fact, a great deal of resources went  to  infrastructure  development  in
areas other than transport, and, of course, there were other  demands  which
had to be dealt with, other claims. I think the Treasury did  very  well  in
trying to steer the country in a way which would address what were the  most
urgent demands and requirements of the country at that time.

At the same time, I think the alarm bells began to  ring  when  it  came  to
transport infrastructure and it became very clear to us, as  time  went  on,
in those first six years, that transport infrastructure had  been  neglected
for far too long. Here I am referring not only  to  roads,  which  are  very
important, but  to  all  transport  infrastructure.  We  talk  about  roads,
railway stations, perways, in relation to railways, our railway  lines,  our
signalling systems and  rolling  stock  in  as  far  as  rail  transport  is
concerned. Then there is our taxi infrastructure,  sea  ports,  land  border
posts and the border posts themselves. As an aside,  one  can  mention  that
the economic integration of the  region  requires  that  all  those  lengthy
delays at our border posts be addressed. We cannot afford  those  delays  if
we want to make ourselves and our region competitive.

The one area in which there was spectacular  development  is  our  airports.
This is because our airports have been successfully  managed.  The  Airports
Company Limited has been reasonably profitable and  has  been  able  to  use
money. This has been our focus - to use the profits made at airports on  the
further development of airports in the country.

There  is  the  very  important   issue   of   taxi   infrastructure.   Taxi
infrastructure is highly neglected. At least 60%  of  our  people,  speaking
nationally,  use  the  minibus-taxi  industry,  an  unsubsidised   mode   of
transport. And yet, if one looks at our taxi  infrastructure,  it  does  not
signal to or tell our people that we care for them, and that they are  equal
to  others  and  are  first-class  citizens.  If  we  look   at   our   taxi
infrastructure in many parts of the country - cold, grey, concrete -  it  is
signalling to our people that maybe they  are  not  as  important  as  other
people are. I know that it is not so, but that is the  perception  which  it
creates.

Therefore, the  issue  of  transport  infrastructure  as  a  whole  is  very
important, and I can say that it is receiving the attention of the  national
Government, as it does  from  provincial  and  local  governments.  So,  the
infrastructure development programme of Government is one which we will  see
unfolding over the next few years. Reference has already been made  in  this
House to the infrastructure grants which have been made, but there  are  the
municipal infrastructure grants which also come  into  play.  Now  that  our
local authorities are in place, they will have a very big role to play.  For
example, with regard to the issue of taxi infrastructure, to  which  I  have
referred, local government has a very important role to play.

In terms of rail transport, we have seen the  beginnings  of  infrastructure
improvements. Already, over 70 stations  have  been  improved  or  upgraded.
Over 70 intermodal exchanges have developed in our country. More  are  going
to be built as time goes on. But we will have to do this  as  a  partnership
between national, provincial and local government. It  would  be  very  easy
for national Government to say that most of these things are provincial  and
local government concerns and have nothing to do with us. But that would  be
entirely wrong. I accept that we are jointly responsible and  that  we  need
to work in partnership.

I can say to this House  that  our  commitment  is  that  we  will  work  in
partnership with local  and  provincial  government,  address  the  concerns
which have been raised and see what we can  do  together  so  that,  in  the
shortest  possible  period  of  time,  we  can  address  the   question   of
infrastructure development.
In this House today, a special reference has been made to road  development.
It is an issue that has been taken up. We intend going to  Cabinet  and,  of
course, we  are  interacting  with  the  provinces,  and  we  will  also  be
interacting with local government to develop a  road  development  plan  for
South Africa. We know that we must look at the problem comprehensively,  but
we must begin to address the problems in an incremental way. If we say  that
our backlog at this stage is X billion rand, it does not mean that  we  will
be able to make X billion rand available. That will not happen.

What we are looking at is a programme  for  infrastructure  development.  In
the case of roads, for example, we would like  to  see  a  road  development
plan which  looks  at  our  primary  and  secondary  road  networks  and  at
national, provincial and local roads, and we would like to  explore  how  we
can secure funding. One of the ways through which we have been able to  make
our national road network look as good as does is by looking at  alternative
sources of funding and the use of tollroads. Unpopular as that  may  be,  in
some instances it has been extremely necessary in  our  country.  There  are
certain practical problems that we need to resolve in that connection,  like
public-private partnerships. Getting consortia to participate on  the  basis
of partnership in the build-operate-transfer programmes has been  successful
in our country and we need to continue to do that.

I would like to say that we very much appreciate that  our  roads  not  only
perform an economic  function,  but  also  perform  a  social  function.  In
implementing alternative methods of funding and using the mechanism  of  the
toll road system, ie imposing tolls, we take into  account  the  fact  that,
very often, local inhabitants, through whose areas  these  roads  pass,  are
hard-pressed and cannot afford to pay these tolls, because  they  use  these
roads every day. So, as we develop an approach to the building of  our  toll
roads, we are refining our approach so that local inhabitants do not  suffer
unduly. For example, in one of the  developments,  which  our  Eastern  Cape
provincial representative can speak much more about that I can because  they
have looked at it, we are looking at a situation in which those who use  the
roads for economic purposes bear the costs of that road.  Local  inhabitants
who live in these areas and have to travel to work and come back should  not
have to pay at all or have to pay very small amounts,  or  there  should  be
substantial concessions or exemptions granted to them. I think that  we  are
refining our approach to the building of  the  roads  through  deciding  who
should bear the costs of them.

In conclusion, I would like to say  that  we  do  recognise  that  transport
infrastructure must receive priority attention, and I am very  confident  in
the way the Treasury has, over the past year, made  more  funding  available
for infrastructure development. We will see that continue over the next  few
years. The challenge before us will be  to  ensure  that  we  have  adequate
plans in place so that we are able to implement  effectively,  so  that  the
money is used efficiently and  so  that  we  are  able  to  deliver  in  the
shortest possible period of time. One of the biggest shames will be  if  the
money is made available to us and there are roll-overs at  the  end  of  the
financial year.

I want to compliment the provinces because that  has  not  happened  in  the
provinces. In a few years, the situation in our provinces has changed.  They
have managed their finances very well, and I have every  confidence  in  the
ability of provinces to deal with the new  challenges  which  now  arise.  I
hope that from a national level we  can,  in  co-operation  with  provinces,
ensure that our new local government structures will also be  able  to  meet
the challenges which face them over the next couple of years. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Thank you, Minister, and again, as  with
all the other Ministers, I should thank  you  for  joining  in  this  fiscal
review set of debates. We now proceed to begin the  debate  on  the  housing
and local government aspects of the review.

We have on our list Mr Ngwenya as the first speaker. Mr Ngwenya, I am  aware
that you have just walked in. Unfortunately, you have to  stand  up  and  do
what you have been deployed to do by your province.

Could the Whips please make sure that the members who are on  the  speakers'
list are in the House so that we can continue with our business.  I  am  not
quite sure why we seem to be rather disorganised. I was informed of  special
delegates and, therefore, everyone should have known when we would begin.

Mr  S  NGWENYA  (Gauteng):  Chairperson,   Ministers   present,   Government
representatives, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for being late.

On behalf of our MEC, Trevor Fowler, I wish to congratulate Minister  Manuel
on a very incisive and informative document on the Intergovernmental  Fiscal
Review. I wish to focus on the  chapters  relating  to  municipalities.  The
national  picture   presented   in   the   document   largely   applies   to
municipalities in Gauteng.

The Intergovernmental Fiscal Review's Chapters 8 through to 11  address  the
expenditure patterns and consequential  challenges  in  municipalities.  Our
Constitution and, indeed, the policies of this Government  are  tailored  to
address these challenges collectively, in short, as  Government  acting  co-
operatively. I  wish  to  address  this  from  the  provincial  government's
perspective.

The role of the provincial government is defined  in  the  Constitution,  in
legislation and by the practical  realities  of  the  current  situation  in
local government.

Chapter 3 of the Constitution defines the  principle  of  co-operation  that
binds all spheres of government - national, provincial and  local.  It  more
specifically defines the functions of national  and  provincial  governments
for co-operation with municipalities in section 154(1) of the  Constitution.
It states that these institutions:


  ... by legislative and other measures, must support  and  strengthen  the
  capacity of municipalities to manage their own affairs, to exercise their
  powers and to perform their functions.

In section 155(6) the role of provincial government  is  explicitly  defined
in  relation  to  this  establishment  of  municipalities.  The   provincial
government must provide the monitoring  and  support,  promote  and  develop
local government capacity.

These imperatives are in plain language and it is clear that the  provincial
government  must  do  the   following:   monitor   the   extent   to   which
municipalities are meeting  their  obligations,  support  municipalities  to
meet  their  obligations  and  provide  leadership   that   promotes   local
government capacity.

There are still millions of our people  who  live  in  poverty.  Government,
particularly municipalities, must contribute to the eradication  of  poverty
if  we  are  to  create   sustainable   communities.   Page   131   of   the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review  refers  to  the  provision  of  free  basic
services as Government's priority and a  concrete  measure  to  address  the
misery of poverty.

In Gauteng, all  municipalities  have  commenced  providing  free  water  to
residents despite the challenges of  administration,  ageing  infrastructure
and other  constraints.  The  reality  is  that  the  past  few  years  have
demonstrated  that  arrears  in  payment  for  services  have  significantly
increased as a result of poverty and  the  inability  of  municipalities  to
administer targeted subsidy programmes such as the indigent policies.

Consequently, the mandate received from the electorate on  5  December  2000
to provide free water and electricity was timely. Municipalities in  Gauteng
are of the general view that the provision of free services  for  the  first
block of consumption and recovery in greater volumes of consumption  is  the
most effective method of cost recovery. It also has a concomitant effect  of
penalising overconsumption in a province  that  imports  about  10%  of  its
water. The real challenge is the mechanism by which  the  rural  and  poorer
districts, such as Metsweding, are going to recover the costs.  Indeed,  the
real challenge to successful implementation is effective revenue  collection
in systems such as accurate billing and credit control.

The Minister has referred to provision of a free amount of  electricity  and
the challenge of electricity sector restructuring in his review. I  wish  to
bring to Comrade Manuel's attention that Eskom supplies most poor people  in
Gauteng. Given the economic profile of  Eskom's  residential  consumers,  we
understand that there are huge financial challenges.

However, the delay in the provision of the free basic amount of  electricity
is placing a huge burden on the municipalities, because many people  believe
it is the municipalities which are delaying access to this  service.  Mayors
have  been  the  targets  of  several  memoranda  and  demonstrations  as  a
consequence.

The Gauteng government is convinced that access to healthy  and  appropriate
water and sanitation is essential in an urban  environment  to  prevent  the
outbreak of disease. We will be investigating the  provision  of  access  to
appropriate water and sanitation for all over the next three years. Soon  we
will announce implementation plans for its provision.

A situational analysis of the state of the  municipalities  in  Gauteng  has
revealed the following strengths and  opportunities  for  transformation  to
viable  and  sustainable  municipalities.  Local  municipalities  have  been
through changes before. There is support  and  commitment  from  Government.
There are new governance structures, and  change  is  inevitable.  Dedicated
resources are available. However, there  are  also  several  weaknesses  and
threats.

Firstly, interim IDPs and planning are not sufficiently driven by  strategic
priorities, nor sufficiently linked to the  budget.  Secondly,  insufficient
human resource management strategies, in particular  change  management  and
stakeholder participation, may result in the loss of experienced  personnel.
Thirdly, management is not sufficiently results-driven. Fourthly, there  are
inadequate skills; and, fifthly, there is poor standardisation.

Madam Chair, this is what the MEC from Gauteng wanted to impress  upon  this
august sitting here. However, the document is too long for me  to  complete.
Oh, sorry, it is not Madam Chair anymore. I am sorry, it's Chairperson  now.
[Laughter.]

In conclusion, having outlined the process, as embarked upon by Gauteng,  we
trust that the National Treasury will be receptive  to  our  perspective  of
beginning a process of creating benchmarks for best  practice,  with  regard
to how municipalities can  be  supported  and  the  extent  of  the  support
required. We are confident that our initiative of setting up  the  municipal
institutional support centre and the possible  migration  to  the  municipal
shared  service  centre  will  go  a  long  way   to   assist   in   putting
municipalities on a sound footing. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  Yes,  hon
members, you must address the Chair, then you will see all the changes  that
are taking place. [Laughter.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Voorsitter, ten aanvang wil ek die Minister van  Finansies
gelukwens met die verslag. Die inligting wat daarin vervat  is,  is  werklik
interessant  en  insiggewend.  [Chairperson,  to  begin  with  I   want   to
congratulate  the  Minister  of  Finance  on  the  report.  The  information
contained in it is really interesting and instructive.]

What is worrying is that although the proportion  of  the  formal  household
dwellings showed a  gradual  increase  of  approximately  4%,  the  informal
dwellings have also increased.

Dit bring 'n mens onder die besef dat behuising altyd 'n uitdaging  vir  die
regering van die dag sal wees. [This makes one  realise  that  housing  will
always remain a challenge to the government of the day.]

According to the report on housing, it  is  mentioned  that  the  Government
``continues to explore innovative alternatives to  speed  up  delivery''.  I
would like to suggest  more  emphasis  on  alternative  building  materials,
building materials that are cheaper than conventional  ones  and  easier  or
quicker to build with. It is also noted that the number of houses  increased
in 1997 to 1998, two years after the initiation of the new housing policy.

The DP would like to warn that the introduction  of  a  transparent  housing
policy will also slow down delivery.  Nevertheless,  the  DP  supports  this
transparent housing procurement policy. It is also encouraging to  see  that
almost half of the provinces have appointed permanent CFOs, that  is,  chief
financial officers. We would also  like  to  call  on  all  the  other  five
provinces to have  their  CFOs  in  permanent  positions  for  the  sake  of
continuity in the newly established CFO forum. This  forum  can  then  start
with the building  of  financial  management  capacity,  especially  in  the
smaller municipalities.

Sustainable low-cost housing delivery is indeed a joint effort, not only  by
the Government and the  private  sector,  but  also  by  different  national
departments, for example Transport and Agriculture.

Dit is byvoorbeeld baie ontstellend om die toestand van  Transnet  se  huise
in Kalbaskraal naby Malmesbury te sien. Ek meen die pryse wat  Transnet  vir
dié huise gevra het, is 'n skande. [It is, for instance, very disturbing  to
see the condition of Transnet's homes  at  Kalbaskraal  near  Malmesbury.  I
feel that the prices Transnet asked for those homes were a disgrace.]

It is also good  to  see  that  Government  is  aiming  at  better  ways  of
mobilising  finance  for  housing  through  the  National  Housing   Finance
Corporation.

Ek glo die regering moet die behuisingsubsidie aanpas.  Dié  subsidie  staan
steeds op dieselfde bedrag as in 1994, naamlik tussen  R15 000  en  R17 000.
In dieselfde tydperk het boumateriaal dramaties gestyg  en  die  waarde  van
die rand het gedaal. Die eindproduk is dus 'n minderwaardige  struktuur,  en
ek glo nie dit is wat die regering in gedagte gehad het vir  die  mense  van
Suid-Afrika nie. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I believe that the Government  should  adjust  the  housing  subsidy.  This
subsidy is still standing at the same amount as in 1994, namely between  R15
000 and R17  000.  Over  the  same  period  building  materials  have  risen
dramatically and the value of the rand  has  slumped.  The  end  product  is
therefore an inferior structure and I do not believe this  to  be  what  the
Government had in mind for the people of South Africa. [Applause.]]

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, bykans 'n jaar  het  verloop  sedert  die  nuwe
plaaslike owerhede in werking getree het. In die Wes-Kaap gaan  dit  in  die
algemeen baie goed. Ons raadslede werk baie hard  en  probeer  hul  probleme
oorbrug om rade goed te laat funksioneer.

Waar dit nie goed gaan nie, is waar die ANC regeer,  soos  in  Worcester  en
Beaufort-Wes. Dáár is dit chaoties. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die President van  dié
land het die mense van Beaufort-Wes belowe  hy  sal  ná  drie  maande  terug
wees. Hy was nog nie  in  Beaufort-Wes  nie  en  die  drie  maande  het  nou
uitgeloop. Ek hoop die mense van Beaufort-Wes neem kennis daarvan. Ek  bring
vandag  hulde  aan  al  die  hardwerkende   raadslede   in   die   Wes-Kaap.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, almost a year has passed since the  new  local
authorities came into operation. In the Western Cape we are generally  doing
very well. Our councillors are working very hard and are trying  to  resolve
their problems in order to enable councils to function effectively.

The situation is less favourable in places where the ANC is in  charge,  for
example in Worcester and Beaufort West. In  those  areas  the  situation  is
chaotic. [Interjections.] The President of this country promised the  people
of Beaufort West that he would be back after three months. He  has  not  yet
been in Beaufort West and three months have now  passed.  I  hope  that  the
people of Beaufort West have taken note of  this.  I  want  to  pay  tribute
today to all the hard-working councillors in the Western Cape.]

Democracy and justice walk hand in hand. Therefore, what a pleasure  it  was
when I walked into the Seven Eleven last night to buy the  Cape  Argus.  Let
me tell the House that the Cape Argus sides with the ANC, and not  with  the
opposition. [Interjections.] And what was on the  front  page  of  the  Cape
Argus? ``City is world number one for value.'' The city of Cape Town is  the
world's number one for value. [Interjections.] Let us hear  what  they  say,
and I hope my colleagues will listen.

Cape Town has been voted the city offering  best  value  for  money  in  the
world.  [Interjections.]  But  it  is  not  resting  on  its  laurels,  with
significant new development  poised  for  the  green  light  from  the  city
council. The city was named the  best  value-for-money  destination  at  the
2001 Condé Nast Traveller magazine's annual readers' awards, and  as  number
11 among the world of cities. Number 11 among the world of cities!  This  is
the Cape Town Unicity. [Interjections.]

The city did not get only this award. It also got an award for the  best-run
city in South Africa. [Interjections.] Do hon members know why  it  got  the
awards? Because the ANC does not govern the  Unicity.  [Interjections.]  The
ANC does not govern the Cape Town Unicity and that is why  we  get  all  the
prizes.  [Interjections.]   That   is   why   we   got   all   the   prizes!
[Interjections.]

The hon Chief Whip is not in the Council at the moment. He said that  we  do
not deliver to the poorest of the poor  in  this  city.  What  is  the  real
truth? If one reads this report of the  fiscal  review,  and  looks  at  the
budget of Johannesburg, the budget of Cape  Town,  and  the  budget  of  old
Pretoria,  or  Tshwane.  [Interjections.]  That  Minister  must  listen.  On
housing alone, there is a backlog of 130 000  houses  in  Pretoria.  Do  hon
members know what that  city  budgets  for  housing?  Pretoria  budgets  R46
million. R46 million! What  does  the  Cape  Town  municipality  budget  for
housing? It budgets R216 million. R216 million!  Johannesburg  budgets  R189
million.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  member,
please take your seat.

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, is it  parliamentary  for  a  member  to  say,
``That Minister'' and do that? It is not. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Hon member,  will  you
continue.

Mr C ACKERMANN: That hon Minister must take note of what is in this report.

Let us take the other issue, on health. The ANC cannot take it. They  cannot
take it when the truth is  on  the  table.  [Interjections.]  Cape  Town  is
spending R252 million. What is Tshwane spending?  Tshwane  is  spending  R90
million. Johannesburg is spending R196 million. These are just a few,  basic
commodities that are very dear to the poor. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana)  Order!  Hon  members,
the Minister will not hear and will not be able to respond if you make  such
a noise.

Mr  C  ACKERMANN:  The  Cape  Town  Unicity  is  spending  more   than   ANC
municipalities  on  the  two  basic  commodities   that   the   poor   want.
[Interjections.] The unicity will  keep  on  delivering.  It  will  keep  on
delivering to the poor. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana)  Order!  Hon  members,
this is not a bar! [Interjections.] Order! [Interjections.]

Mr C B HERANDIEN (Western Cape):  Chairperson,  on  perusal  of  the  report
highlighting the  issue  of  housing,  I  concur  whole-heartedly  with  the
contents of the report. There does, however, appear to be  a  difference  of
opinion in two of the tables, namely 6.3 and 6.5, but I do not believe  them
to be material at this stage to improved housing  delivery,  and  therefore,
no debate or discussion will be of profit.

I do, however, wish to table a few of the  concerns  the  Western  Cape  has
with regard to expeditious and efficient housing delivery.  With  regard  to
the new procurement measures, this province supports  entirely  the  concept
of a transparent housing procurement policy. I do,  however,  wish  to  warn
that  the  introduction  thereof  will,  by   the   very   nature   of   its
implementation, bring  about  an  initial  slowing  down  of  delivery.  The
Department of Finance must take clear cognisance thereof.

In respect to local government and the responsibility for services,  I  must
emphasise that since its inception the housing fraternity has been  carrying
the costs for the provision of trading services  to  our  housing  projects.
This has, obviously, come at a cost to the size of buildings built  for  the
beneficiaries. It is common knowledge that local  authorities  benefit  from
the revenue generated by trading services, despite not  investing  a  single
cent themselves. Surely this must be reviewed to allow our  homeless  people
to enjoy the full benefit of their subsidy, and not just a portion  thereof,
as is the case at present.

The advent of IDPs could not have come soon enough. As part of  the  housing
family, we have not produced integrated realistic housing  environments.  We
have merely perpetuated the planning paradigm prior to 1994, where the  poor
were settled the furthest away from the social fabric of a  town  with  very
little, if any, social facilities. Proper implementation of the  IDPs  will,
I dare say, ensure that we no longer repeat  the  type  of  developments  we
have now.

In talking about integrated development, I must also  make  a  plea  to  all
other national line-function departments associated  with  delivery  to  the
poor, such as water and electricity, to work  closely  with  the  provincial
departments of housing, so  as  to  ensure  a  holistic  approach  to  human
settlement development.

I would like to offer my  compliments  to  the  Department  of  Housing  for
introducing  this  programme.  Our  housing  landscape  is   littered   with
dysfunctional settlements. My plea to the  Department  of  Housing  is  that
this programme should be a permanent housing programme within our  suite  of
housing programmes, and should receive  an  increased  allocation  over  the
MTEF period. It has always been the contention of  this  province  that  the
figures, and not the criteria, should be used for the allocation of  housing
funds, and that that will be based on the true numbers.

The 1996 census figures form the backbone of the  allocation  criteria,  and
it is common knowledge that they have been found  wanting.  To  ensure  that
provinces get what they are actually entitled to, it is strongly urged  that
this dimension of the allocation criteria be urgently reviewed.  Many  local
authorities are now beginning to challenge  the  notion  that  they  can  be
enjoined in the housing delivery loop, as they feel it is  not  a  municipal
responsibility. Specific  reference  is  made  to  the  Constitution,  which
apportions  legislative  competency  in  housing  matters  to  national  and
provincial governments' housing delivery, but it must not be delayed  around
issues of competency and unfounded mandates as alluded  to  by  the  various
municipalities.

An urgent plea is made to  the  Department  of  Housing  to  make  a  public
announcement in this  regard,  setting  out  in  detail  reasons  why  local
authorities  can  be  compelled  to  take  the  responsibility  for  housing
delivery in their areas of jurisdiction. This is  very  closely  aligned  to
the  prescription  of  the  new  procurement  measurements  which  apportion
responsibility to municipalities to act as developers.

A great concern for housing delivery in the Western Cape is the lack of all-
round capacity amongst some of the smaller municipalities to deliver or  see
to the project management of housing projects.

I strongly urge that both  the  provinces  and  the  Department  of  Housing
should join hands in developing and implementing  capacity-building  courses
within municipalities, so as to ensure efficient housing  delivery.  Despite
the advent of newly elected local government structures, the  experience  is
that there is still a great degree of gatekeeping in the  delivery  process,
resulting in a delay in housing delivery. Threats  of  violence  are  common
occurrences.  In  some  instances,  elected  ward  councillors   have   been
assassinated because of their desire to see development.  It  is  imperative
that the housing fraternity not allow themselves to be  held  to  ransom  by
the lawless few, and that the agents of law and order provide the  necessary
support as and when necessary.

As a province, the issue  of  farmworkers'  housing  is  presenting  a  huge
challenge, as the number of farmworkers that are being  evicted  from  farms
increases. In seeking a solution to this vexing problem,  the  province  has
developed a farmworkers' settlement policy, which  provides  scope  for  on-
farm, off-farm and agrivillage formations as solutions. I can almost  state,
with certainty, that this issue is prevalent throughout other provinces  bar
one, and requires the full attention of Government at all levels.

In conclusion, I would like to state that the provinces should  accept  full
responsibility  for  the  housing  of  the  homeless  as  enforced  by   the
Constitution and should join the national Government  in  seeking  solutions
to all the problems and challenges confronting us. [Applause.]

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, Minister, MECs, special delegates and members,  we
are honoured to participate in this debate on the  housing  chapter  of  the
IGFR. Having participated in the public hearings that took  place  recently,
we were struck  by  the  enormity  of  the  challenges  facing  the  housing
department. The IGFR reflects the fact that housing remains one of  the  key
postapartheid challenges, challenges relating  not  only  to  backlogs,  but
also  to  the  spatial  environment  and  the  quality  of  community  life.
Alongside  national  and  local   government,   provinces   play   a   role,
particularly  in  providing  housing.  Since  1994,   the   Government   has
contributed to over 1,2 million low-cost houses, providing shelter  to  over
five million people. This reduced  the  housing  backlog  significantly  and
translates into providing shelter to an estimated one  out  of  every  eight
persons.

These new housing projects could be the conduit to deracialising  societies.
The housing sector faces notable institutional challenges  of  delivery  and
accountability, and these include the consolidated municipal  infrastructure
programme  and  social  economic  infrastructure  that  contribute  to   the
development of sustainable human settlements. Underspending  over  the  last
three years has improved largely as a result of  improved  capacity  in  the
provinces. However, the highest underspending during  2000-01  was  recorded
in the Northern Province as a result of floods.

In October 1999 a household survey shows certain patterns  regarding  access
to housing, water and electricity.  These  patterns  partially  reflect  the
impact of housing delivery on the overall quality of life.  The  portion  of
households living in formal dwellings showed a gradual increase  from  65,8%
in 1995 to 69% in 1999. On the other hand, the number of  households  living
in informal dwellings has also increased, as the  pressure  for  shelter  is
experienced across all types of housing. The 2001 review informs us that  no
new homes were constructed during the current financial year  in  the  North
West province. However, the MEC informed the meeting that 8 379  homes  were
built in the year under review.

Variation in the pace of delivery is  also  evident  in  the  roll-overs  in
housing subsidy funds. Where the provincial  housing  department  had  roll-
overs exceeding R2,2 billion, or 71% of its allocated housing subsidy  funds
in 1995-96, it has estimated roll-overs of R590 million, or  15%,  in  2000-
01. It is clear from this that certain  obstacles  to  sustainable  delivery
have been identified, and government continues to explore ways to  speed  up
delivery,  and  to  contribute  to  the  development  of  sustainable  human
settlement.

Financial management in the sector has improved.  Further  steps  are  being
taken to  improve  and  streamline  the  funding  arrangements  for  housing
programmes. These include converting the housing into a  conditional  grant,
resulting in all funds received  by  provincial  housing  departments  being
deposited into the  appropriate  provincial  revenue  fund,  thus  improving
accountability over such funds. It must also comply with national norms  and
standards.

One of the most problematic obstacles to delivery is the delay in  the  land
transfer process, which is necessitated by legal aspects of  land  transfer.
The recent local government elections impacted  badly  on  the  delivery  of
houses, and municipalities delay in approving new housing  programmes  as  a
result of the  nonpayment  of  property  rates.  This  projects  a  negative
picture, namely that government does not care about the poor.

Secondly, with regard to programmes approved  and  subsidies  allocated,  it
has been established  that  there  is  a  lack  of  communication  from  the
provinces to the  people,  such  that  people  are  not  informed  of  their
allocations, and they take part in land invasions, whereas their houses  are
ready for occupation.

Natural  phenomena  such  as  floods   and   tornadoes   resulted   in   the
underutilisation of conditional grants. Although  the  duration  of  natural
disasters was short,  the  periods  in  delays  were  logically  beyond  the
incidence of the disasters themselves. Some of the most  critical  obstacles
are the double allocation of houses and lack  of  co-ordination  across  the
spheres of government and amongst all sectors. Fraud and  corruption  should
be addressed in the allocation of the houses.

The  following  recommendations  have  been  made:  An  in-principle  policy
decision has been taken that 0,5% to 0,7% of provincial budgets has to  deal
with emergencies such as disasters. All participants should be  captured  in
a database, which links the provinces,  to  avoid  this  double  allocation.
Both the national and provincial governments should work together  to  solve
such problems as housing delivery as it is a priority of both  national  and
provincial departments.

The department has shifted from  its  policy  of  quantity  to  quality,  as
reflected in the fact that speeding up delivery compromises the  quality  of
houses. MECs have to facilitate the problems related  to  bureaucracy,  such
as delays in approving new  housing  programmes  as  a  result  of  property
rates. The Minister has also recommended that women  in  housing  should  be
promoted and not marginalised.

Due to an increase in shelter demand, the upgrading of informal  settlements
should be prioritised so as to bring  water  and  sanitation.  It  has  been
agreed that provinces should indicate problems they experience so  that  the
Minister can be aware of them, such as in  the  case  of  the  Minister  for
Agriculture and Land Affairs, who is helping with the issue of the the  R281
certificates to speed up the process.

There should be a standard  payment  system  in  place  to  minimise  fraud.
Guidelines with regard  to  the  special  needs  of  certain  categories  of
historically disadvantaged people, such as women and the  disabled,  in  the
allocation of houses should be a priority. Local  government  should  comply
with national norms and standards  in  housing,  and  not  raise  standards,
which has caused the collapse of projects.

Local governments should avoid paying a lot of  money  to  consultants.  The
devolution of responsibilities should be accompanied by reciprocal funding.

Mr Ackermann  echoed  and  expressed  the  frustrations  and  anger  of  the
confusion in the leaderless Cape Town. The Minister should  not  respond  to
his infantile outburst. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Before I  go  on,  hon
members, can I make it clear that I will  not  condone  or  countenance  any
deliberate transgressions of the rules of  this  House.  Mrs  Vilakazi,  you
know you are wrong in what you are doing. Are you ready to apologise?
Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, yes, I do apologise.

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Chairperson, I am not sure of the format.  Have  we
come to the end of the input from the provinces?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Probably  as  far  as
housing is concerned.

The MINISTER: Chairperson, I think we have come to a  stage  as  Government,
at national, provincial and local spheres, where there  is  an  urgent  need
for us to focus on issues and come up with appropriate  solutions  to  those
problems.

We have been trying to observe the response of the public, or the  consumer,
in relation to payment for rates and services, and  from  the  feedback,  as
recorded by the different municipalities, it does look  as  if  we  do  have
successes in certain areas, and failures in other areas.  However,  I  think
we need to  look  at  the  issue  at  two  levels.  At  one  level  we  have
unemployment and poverty in the country.  At  the  second  level  it  is  an
observation of poor communities that they have been able to play a  role  in
terms of participating in improving the quality of their lives.

So, when we deal with this problem, we need to take into consideration  that
there are genuine factors and issues, but also that  in  certain  situations
there is plain recalcitrance by those who are supposed to  respond  to  rate
payments.

There has been an input from the lady of the  DP  -  unfortunately  she  has
left for the airport - in  relation  to  alternative  building  material.  I
think those members who have been involved in doing a survey  by  virtue  of
being in areas, and looking at the delivery in those areas,  will  be  aware
of the fact  that  there  is  a  preferred  pattern  by  the  consumer.  Our
consumer, up to now, prefers to have shelter that is provided through  brick
and mortar.

It is very difficult for us to force them to be consumers of material  other
than brick and mortar. However, in the industry one does have a  variety  of
building material coming forward through technology, but our people are  not
yet ready to consume that, partly because  of  experience,  but  in  certain
situations because of culture.

Our people are averse to living in shelters made out of wood. They say  they
are afraid of fires, and if one looks back at our  immediate  history,  fire
has played a very difficult and painful role in terms of transformation  and
change in relation to the communities that were effected by fires, and  they
continue to affect us in the informal settlements.

The issue of adjusting the housing subsidy is a matter  which  is  currently
under  discussion  with  Treasury.  We  will  make  an   announcement   when
necessary. It is an issue that we are aware of.

I need to correct an hon member and remind this member that when we  started
in 1994, the housing subsidy  was  R15 000.  In  1997-1998  it  went  up  to
R16 000. There is an agreement that it is time to  review  this  amount.  We
will come back to the House when we are ready.
Regarding the increase of the subsidy, when we look at that  issue  we  also
have to consider the fact that it is our policy to go back  to  our  housing
paper. Our policy has always invited the consumer, the communities, to  play
a role in accessing housing. This was built into the policy because we  were
cognisant of the fact that Government  on  its  own,  with  its  own  fiscal
ability, may not be able to provide the amount of money  that  people  would
expect.

If one looks at the waiting list of about 7,5 million people and the  amount
of money that we would like to utilise in providing the infrastructure  that
relates to housing, one becomes well aware of the fact  that  it  runs  into
billions of rands. One has to bear that in mind.

I want to say to the hon Mr Ackermann that I really do not want to get  into
the politics of his emotional outburst. [Interjections.]  I  understand  why
he has to be so excited and express whatever he  wants  to  express  in  the
manner that he does. Our condolences are with him. [Laughter.] [Applause.]
In the case of Mr Herandien, I think it has been one of the most  sober  and
amicable presentations from the Western Cape. Hon members are aware  of  the
fights that we have. [Applause.] I think we have  to  commend  him  for  his
sobriety  because  all  of   us,   especially   those   that   are   housing
practitioners, are aware of the fact that this is a very difficult  terrain.
One has to look at the issues and be balanced and rational in  the  way  one
deals with them.

MECs addressed the issue in a conciliatory manner. What  we  still  need  to
see is that members realise that our records are official. They  are  backed
by the census. These records reflect the backlog as  follows:  The  province
with the highest backlog is Gauteng. It  is  not  the  Minister  of  Housing
saying so because she is from Gauteng, not at all. It  is  the  census.  The
census says the majority of informal settlements are  in  Gauteng,  followed
by KwaZulu-Natal and then the Western Cape.

That in itself helps us to plan how we utilise  our  resources  and  how  we
spread the resources to those who need our support. We  need  to  understand
this fact so that we do not politicise it. It is a factual reality.

The same goes for the procurement policy that has gone  through  Minmec.  We
have to realise that in the first term of office it was necessary for us  to
approach delivery in the manner we did. Now we are in the  second  phase  of
delivery. There are certain considerations that have to be tabled.

We now have to ensure that our delivery patterns redress some of the  issues
we were unable to address in our first  term  of  office.  One  is  that  we
delivered in those areas where land was available, that is  former  township
areas. They were serviced and  had  infrastructure,  and  we  could  deliver
there.

The most difficult thing for Government to do was to deliver on those  plots
of land. If we did not, it would have meant  that  we  would  lose  all  the
money that had been invested. However, by doing that, we did  not  say  that
we want to perpetuate the old apartheid patterns. We  have  done  that  with
the more than 198 000 serviced plots we inherited.

Now we have the opportunity to look at our  policy  framework  and  identify
which way to go, and have done that. Under the leadership of  the  President
of this country, we now have to deliver  in  those  areas  where  in  future
there will be economic activity.

That is why we deliver projects such as the one at Coega. It is one  of  our
best projects. People in the rural area participated in housing  acquisition
in  a  manner  never  experienced  before.  The  local  government  is  also
involved.

Secondly, we say let us go out and identify land in the inner city  that  we
can purchase. Our records say there might be  very  little  land  available,
according to the statistics  of  Land  Affairs.  What  remains  of  the  1,2
million hectares of land that belongs to the state?  Some  669 000  hectares
have already been allocated.  The  remaining  pieces  of  land  have  to  be
divided for settlement, agricultural, commercial  and  industrial  purposes.
This Government has to think very seriously about where we want to focus.

Thirdly,  we  have  to  work  and  make  sure  that  we   do   achieve   the
deracialisation of society by bringing people closer to  the  inner  cities.
We have to rework our programmes in a manner that promotes medium density.

I can proudly say that we have taken a decision after extensive  discussions
with Treasury. Henceforth we would like to move slightly on the emphasis  on
medium density. We would like to absorb  the  middle-income  group  awaiting
housing. At the same time we want to include the merging  of  the  different
income groups and classes to create a revenue base. This will enable  us  to
pull people closer to the amenities in the inner cities, which is  something
we have to work on. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr  B  J  MKHALIPHI:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  local
government is probably the key role-player in the delivery of  services  and
development processes in South Africa today.

The transformation process and the establishment of financially  viable  and
sustainable municipalities are crucial if one wants to see local  government
fulfil its developmental role. In this regard, major steps have been taken.

I want to name a few, namely providing  a  clear  and  motivating  framework
through the White Paper on  Local  Government;  the  redemarcation  process,
which resulted in more  fiscally  viable,  although  fewer,  municipalities,
which will also address  the  need  for  sound  financial  management,  and,
lastly, the provision of a new legal framework for local government  through
the Local Government: Municipal Structures Act  and  the  Local  Government:
Municipal Systems Act.

The Intergovernmental Fiscal Review  of  this  year  highlights  the  fiscal
realities that need to be considered to secure the sustainability  of  these
objectives. In line with our  Constitution,  many  national  and  provincial
departments are considering which of their functions are best  performed  in
the local  sphere,  a  major  challenge  as  this  department  devolves  its
functions and powers downwards to the local sphere. The outcry is  for  more
corresponding resources in terms of finance and personnel.  Functions  under
review include housing  delivery,  primary  health  care  and  the  district
health system, water and municipal services and municipal policing.

Regarding water and sanitation services, an outcry has  been  heard  in  the
public hearings that, most of the time, the municipalities  to  which  these
services are devolved always lack the capacity to maintain  and  to  operate
these  services  to  such  an  extent  that  they  eventually  disintegrate.
Already,  personnel  calls  have  become  the  foremost  cost   driver   for
municipalities in recent years. This affects the scope  to  expand  delivery
as budgets come under extreme  pressure.  Therefore  it  is  paramount  that
municipalities manage personnel expenditure properly.

Municipalities also have conditions of service and  salary  bands  that  are
quite different from those of national and  provincial  departments.  Within
these and other spheres, there is one Public Service,  where  all  employees
have the same  system  of  benefits  such  as  pensions  and  salary  bands.
Consolidating the Public Service would, therefore, require  service  benefit
equalisation, as we are seeing now in the new amalgamated municipalities.

Further work such as the financial impact of medical aid benefits which  are
also unequal and the  number  of  employees  in  this  sphere  on  municipal
budgets is also required before consideration can be given to an  integrated
Public Service. At the municipal level, the councils are also challenged  to
include the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Strategy and the  Urban
Renewal Strategy to dovetail with the recent IDPs that have been compiled.

The metropolitan municipalities have distinct and  major  revenue-generating
capacities and are only marginally  dependent  on  transfers  from  national
Government. Many rural and smaller urban  municipalities,  however,  have  a
much weaker fiscal capacity and depend considerably on  transfers  from  the
national Government. The hon member Masemola would be able to tell us  about
municipalities such as Thembisile in the Mpumalanga area.

Government's commitment to assist in the provision of  free  basic  services
requires the implementation of focused and targeted  fiscal  and  integrated
programmes at all spheres of government. This does not,  however,  alleviate
the need for  improved  financial  management  by  municipalities  to  spend
within their budgets and to collect revenue that is  due  to  them,  and  to
also expand, enhance and maintain their revenue bases.

Capital expenditure has been declining as a percentage  of  total  spending,
as actual capital spending is less than budgeted. Being  of  a  discretional
nature, capital expenditure is the  first  victim  when  budgets  are  under
pressure and crosscutting measures are to be put  in  place.  Municipalities
need capital projects such as water and waste  water  treatment  plants  and
distribution networks, solid waste disposal  facilities,  streets,  clinics,
and community facilities, etc.

The  operation  and  maintenance  of  these  facilities  remains   a   major
challenge. Therefore it has become necessary to fast-track  legislation  and
processes to reform  and  to  ensure  that  regulatory  budgetary  financial
management  and   systems   jointly   create   a   conducive   climate   for
decentralisation and sound financial management. This will  further  require
that functions between  category  B  and  C  municipalities  and  associated
revenue streams between the two spheres  of  government  are  clearly  spelt
out.

The enactment  of  new  legislation  governing  local  government  financial
management,  including  a  municipal  borrowing  framework,  in  the  mooted
municipal  financial  management  Bill  is  linked  to  the  enhancing   and
consolidation of intergovernmental transfers and provision  of  guidance  to
municipalities to ensure not only that the system does not benefit only  the
rich consumers, but that the cost of services remains affordable to all  and
that those who can pay for these services actually do so.

In addition, the redemarcation processes have also created the existence  of
cross-border municipalities and associated complications.  I  heard  someone
calling  them  the  fourth  sphere   of   government.   Examples   of   such
municipalities are Carletonville and Stilfontein in Gauteng and  North  West
as well as Bushbuckridge and  Phalaborwa  in  Mpumalanga  and  the  Northern
Province. The boundaries of these municipalities extend over the  provinces,
as mentioned. The challenge, for example, is that it is not clear  to  which
housing board the respective municipalities have access in terms of  finding
financial resources for housing loans. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  members,
allow me to take this opportunity to recognise the  presence  of  the  first
lady, Ms Mbeki, in the gallery. I welcome her to the NCOP. [Applause.]
Mr J I MABENA (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, my name is J I Mabena.  It  appears
on the speakers' list as J S Mabona, who happens to be my uncle, who is  the
MEC for public works.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Chairperson  for  the
opportunity to participate in this debate on what  the  Director-General  of
the National Treasury correctly refers to as a barometer of  provincial  and
local government fiscal trends.

The IGFR can also be described as a very important radar that can  guide  us
towards the destination of improved quality of Government  expenditure,  and
the meeting of  our  major  challenge  of  delivering  quality  services  at
affordable prices and to more South Africans.  The  fact  that  this  year's
edition not only updates all sectors covered in previous reviews,  but  also
deals with housing and provincial roads, is  an  achievement  that  must  be
celebrated by all of us.

The convergence that has developed through, inter alia, joint  Minmecs  must
be enhanced as improved co-ordination remains one of the  prerequisites  for
our success in maximising quality service delivery.

The inclusion of nonfinancial information comes at an  opportune  time  with
the implementation of the PFMA, which shifts the focus  from  how  much  one
spent to whether there is value for money in terms of outputs  and  outcomes
which have been  agreed  upon  upfront.  The  information  will,  therefore,
facilitate the assessment of outputs and outcomes.

We  know  that  the  review  also  highlights  the  important  role  of  the
provincial sphere of  government  in  the  implementation  of  major  social
services, most of which have limited or no cost recovery measures.  We  must
build on the information contained in this  edition  and,  of  course,  find
solutions to blockages  such  as  the  lack  of  a  common  methodology  for
comparisons and readily available information.

It is a fact that infrequent local government elections  are  of  themselves
inadequate mechanisms to ensure local democracy. Tangible delivery of  basic
services at affordable prices and constant refreshing of electoral  mandates
by communities, are fundamental to both social and economic development  and
a successful developmental local government.

The  public-private   partnership   funding   options   for   infrastructure
development must be strengthened. We must use all the means at our  disposal
to make the public-private partnership projects that are already  in  place,
like the the Nelspruit water project, a success. This will require  that  we
deal with all known blockages  and  also  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the
municipalities to monitor  implementation  and  adherence  to  predetermined
service performance criteria by the contractors.

We must, of course, also ensure that the implementation of these  PPPs  does
meet our empowerment policy interests. We must also, in this important  area
of work, as the review does on provincial trends, learn  from  the  mistakes
we may have made in implementing some of these  PPP  projects.  There  is  a
need  to  monitor  and  ensure  that  municipalities  concentrate  on  their
comparative and competitive strengths. I would like to submit to this  House
that there is no area without at least one indigenous exploitable  resource,
as even deserts and steppes can cast a spell that can become a resource  for
tourism. I think that our colleagues from the Northern Cape  can  attest  to
this.

The strengthening of the capacity of  local  government  to  raise  its  own
revenue and to formulate comprehensive integrated development plans  remains
an important challenge. One agrees with the assertion that there is  a  need
to align the elements of the transformation of this sphere, so the  call  in
the  IGFR  for  the  alignment  of  developmental  management  and   service
delivery, institutional reform and  capacity-building,  the  demarcation  of
boundaries,  physical  reform  and  the  creation  of  a  vibrant  borrowing
environment must be supported.

Regarding housing delivery, the backlog of R2,2 million as outlined  in  the
IGFR is huge  and  requires  us  to  do  something  about  the  bureaucratic
problems that impact negatively on the pace of delivery. Our experience,  as
a province, shows that housing delivery  is  an  18-month  cycle,  with  the
first nine months necessary for  the  resolution  of  land-related  matters.
This requires forward planning of up to a  year  before  delivery  can  take
place. We must, through co-operation and comanagement of  infrastructure  in
programmes like the CMIP, deal with problems around property  rates  payment
demands prior to the issuing of clearance certificates, which  also  affects
tenure upgrade programmes.

With regard to the Jobs Summit housing projects,  we  would  really  welcome
the finalisation of issues relating to the funds  by  the  national  Housing
and Finance departments. It is, indeed,  encouraging  to  realise  that  the
review also highlights,  honestly,  some  of  the  major  mistakes  we  made
immediately after 1994 and some of the hard and eye-opening lessons that  we
must learn from those mistakes, most of which were as a result  of  lack  of
capacity.

The lack of capacity to spend in Government departments  and  the  need  for
the creation of a new interface between those who have needs and  those  who
manage the money, as the hon the Minister, T Manuel, once  argued,  must  be
dealt with as a priority. The combination of this  important  tool,  in  the
form of the IGFR and  adequate  and  focused  capacity-building  programmes,
will ensure that we deal squarely with the capacity  conundrum  -  the  DBSA
that Mr Jay Naidoo talks about when arguing that we face  not  a  crisis  of
capital, but rather a capacity one.

In conclusion, we believe that  there  is  cause  for  us  as  a  nation  to
celebrate  the  major  improvements  contained  in   this   year's   review.
[Applause.]

Mr S L TSENOLI (Free State): Chairperson, hon Minister and Deputy  Minister,
and hon members, the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review is a critical one  that
is meant to reflect the relationships in  the  resource  allocation  between
the three spheres of government. It is, therefore,  a  useful  barometer  to
measure the impact of the resources that we collectively collect. But it  is
also a critical instrument in building our co-operative relationships.

The Constitution provides that this relationship  should  be  interdependent
and interrelated, albeit distinct. In examining our resource allocations  to
date, we want  to  be  able  to  see  that  relationship  reflected  in  the
financial flows. In other words, it is not,  in  and  of  itself,  operating
outside of those relationships as anticipated in the Constitution.

We want to add our word of congratulation to the Treasury for a  continually
improving fiscal review, not only in quantity but also  in  the  quality  of
the information contained therein, specifically progressing from no  mention
of local government to a cursory reference to several  chapters  now,  which
is a huge and a very important part of the review. This reference  to  local
government in the manner and the degree to which it  is  mentioned  here  is
significant.

The Canadian Federation of Municipalities head, Jacques  Jobin,  once  said,
in  his  capacity  as  secretary  of  the  International  Union   of   Local
Authorities, that local government is destined to  be  the  institution  for
improving the quality of  lives  in  all  communities.  He  also  said  that
although there are those who dismiss it on the grounds  of  what  they  call
corruption and inefficiency,  rightly  or  wrongly,  they  miss  the  bigger
picture of the evolving significance of  local  government  and,  therefore,
the need for national, provincial and global  structures  of  governance  to
give active support to municipalities. It is for that  reason  that  we  are
particularly well pleased with the amount of work that has been done  around
local government and with the undertaking to improve that work.

The fiscal review itself is also significant in  its  open  and  transparent
reference to some of the weaknesses that are still  there,  including  those
of the potential hazard of unfunded mandate, the inadequacy  of  information
to date  about  local  government  transformation,  and  also  the  capacity
problem that continues to bedevil us. Often we do  not  raise  these  issues
sharply enough and we often underestimate the legacy of apartheid  policies,
especially in relation not only to broad development and infrastructure  but
also  to  the  people  factors  such  as  the  availability  of  skills  and
insufficient numbers at a variety of levels in order  to  make  the  biggest
impact in the institutions that we have created.

The  collaboration  of  municipalities  and  provincial  government  in  the
evolution of this review is a very important one. The manner in  which  that
happens is particularly critical. Again, I would  like  to  refer  to  Jobin
when he said about this matter that the difference between looking at -  let
me talk about a rose because I am from a city of roses -  the  beauty  of  a
rose on a picture, and actually holding  it  in  one's  hand,  smelling  its
pleasant fragrance and feeling the vulnerability of  its  petals,  is  huge.
This is why the participatory evolution  of  this  fiscal  review  involving
local and provincial governments is a crucial one for us. [Interjections.]
The role of  local  government  in  the  development  programmes  generally,
especially in poverty alleviation, is acknowledged by the  UNDP  as  one  of
the key agendas for building governance in that the  integrated  development
plan which our country has adopted as a way through which  local  government
must now inform its budget is important progress.  It  is  also  crucial  to
remind ourselves that it will only be in March 2002  that  the  first  final
IDPs, which have been comprehensively formulated, will be adopted.  What  we
have now are actually interim integrated development plans.

The key around this is that the current practice of provincial and  national
departments is not appropriate to the vision that we have already  designed.
We  require  some  way  in  which,  through  reporting  requirements,   some
incentives and penalties, we can  encourage  both  provincial  and  national
departments to  participate  in  the  formulation  of  IDPs  and  to  do  so
timeously,  but  also  involve  appropriate  senior  officials  in   various
departments.

The impact on housing is an important one.  Local  government  is  going  to
make the biggest difference in housing delivery, especially because  we  are
now talking about integrated development plans, and housing forms a  crucial
part  of  the  integrated  housing  delivery  plans  of  these   IDPs.   The
sustainability of such plans will  lie,  in  very  important  ways,  in  the
degree to which provincial and national  departments  participate  in  these
programmes.

The Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Strategy  is  already  throwing
out very important lessons for  some  of  us  in  terms  of  the  audits  of
projects in this area, of who is doing what in this  area.  Thereafter,  the
replication of that information throughout the provinces is, in  fact,  what
is going to  have  to  characterise  the  nature  of  development  in  every
municipality in our province. The  requirement  for  those  projects  to  be
packaged so that they have bigger impacts is  one  of  the  biggest  lessons
that we are learning through the Integrated  Sustainable  Rural  Development
Strategy.

With regard to the fiscal review and the  nonfinancial  information  it  now
promises to improve, which I hope will include  a  gendered  perspective  on
these issues, we would like, at both provincial and local government  level,
to draw on the lessons which  we  thought  the  Department  of  Finance  had
created in terms of  some  institutional  capacity  to  handle  and  provide
disaggregated  gender-related  information.   Such   information   will   be
critical, and will help us to make a better assessment of what impact  every
rand that is allocated is actually making in the most critical area  of  our
lives.

I raise this issue because the majority of the  population  in  my  province
consists of females and youth. If we look at the levels of  poverty  of  the
province, it actually says that if we are talking about poor people  we  are
talking about women. If we  talking  about  unemployed  people,  we  talking
about women. If we talking about the people on whom  HIV/Aids  has  impacted
heavily, we are talking about women.

It is for this reason that we think the gendered  perspective,  as  part  of
this evolving fiscal review, shows the  relationship  between  our  resource
allocations and the  impact  on  poverty,  and  if  it  is  in  that  manner
especially it will be very useful.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Thank  you,  hon
member, your time has expired. [Applause.]

Order! The new speakers' list that I now have allows me  to  call  upon  the
hon MEC of finance for the Eastern Cape - he was not on my previous  list  -
Mr E Godongwana to address this House.

Mr E GODONGWANA (Eastern  Cape):  Chairperson,  national  Ministers  present
here, colleagues from other provinces, hon  members  of  this  House,  I  am
tempted to respond to the hon Ackermann here.

Mr C ACKERMANN: Do not be tempted.

Mr E GODONGWANA (Eastern Cape): No, I am. I am responding  to  him  and  the
unfortunate language the DA accuses us of using, that of invoking  the  race
card. [Interjections.] The unfortunate part of dealing with the  history  of
this country is that one cannot avoid the concept of race. One cannot!  This
is  because  the  very  fundamentals  of  apartheid  were  based  on   race.
Therefore,  we  cannot  avoid  making  reference  to   history   and   race.
[Interjections.]

Mr C ACKERMANN: Why are all the people from the Eastern Cape coming to  live
here? [Interjections.]

Mr E GODONGWANA (Eastern Cape): I am coming to that  point.  The  reason  is
that they have systematically developed over  decades  ways  of  undermining
certain parts of this country and making them  deserts.  Afghanistan,  which
is being bombed by the Americans, is nothing compared to some of the  places
in the Eastern Cape. The Nats deliberately did that, which is where the  hon
member comes from. [Interjections.]

He deliberately skewed the resources of this country. Let me  just  give  an
example. This House  at  the  moment  is  going  to  debate  the  Industrial
Development Amendment Bill. It is one of the  Bills  which  begins  to  give
powers to the IDC to be able to deal with tourism  infrastructure.  But,  in
this province, even before that mandate was given to the IDC,  the  IDC  was
already allowed to do that - spending R65  million  building  a  nice  thing
that goes on the mountain, a tourist destination - this was part of the  hon
member's history.

We are dealing with the racial resources that were  deliberately  skewed  by
his people. And then he comes here and makes  himself  out  to  have  better
administrators. [Interjections.] Having said that, I  come  to  the  matters
under review here.

With regard to this  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review,  part  of  the  1999
review makes reference  to  some  of  the  provinces  that  began  the  1998
financial year with outstanding debts. The Eastern Cape  was  one  of  those
provinces.

We take pride in saying that we are also, in this  financial  year,  counted
amongst those who have improved financial  management,  but  accepting  that
this was at a cost. We had to  do  a  number  of  things,  for  instance  in
containing personnel costs, we had to reduce personnel from 139 000  to  126
000.  That  was  huge.  Also,  we  reduced  capital  expenditure,  which  is
reflected here in the document, as we did, to some extent  in  some  of  the
complementary inputs that are required for some of our social services.

It has been a painful process but it has paid off. It  has  paid  dividends.
Today we can proudly say that we are now able to focus on  service  delivery
of social services  and  to  prioritise  spending  on  social  and  economic
infrastructure.

We  do  not  deny  that  there  are  important  challenges  that  are  still
confronting us. Chief amongst those is the issue of backlogs. For  instance,
we inherited  about  42 000  km,  which  are  proclaimed  roads,  under  the
provincial government. When we  took  over  only  4 000  km  were  paved  or
surfaced. At the moment we have almost managed to pave about  7 000  km.  We
intend to continue doing that and improving our service delivery.

A key issue in any poor community is HIV/Aids. Again, our focus there is  on
two pillars: dealing with prevention and dealing with  home-based  care.  Of
particular importance in the lessons we have learned is that  we  tended  to
put more resources into health, only to find that the  home-based  care  was
more pertinent to welfare.

Those are some of the issues we are grappling  with.  I  must  confess  that
from our side the focus has not been on what is called treatment.  We  leave
that to national Government. Our assumption at the moment is that -  and  we
stand to be corrected - there is no medicine that does that. The reason  for
the fact that there is too much debate and focus on treatment,  and  not  on
prevention,  eludes  me.  Unless  one  is  a  marketing  salesman   of   the
pharmaceutical companies, I would not know why one would focus on that as  a
major issue.

The third issue, of course, is the child support grant. This is going to  be
a major challenge for us if one  looks  at  the  projected  figures  by  the
national Department of Social Development. Despite  the  fact  that  we  are
number three in terms of population in the country, in terms  of  the  take-
up, at the peak we would be number one at 780 000, with KZN being  600  000.
Clearly that poses a challenge for us. It is an issue which we think  is  an
important point.

Again, the fourth element is  skilled  personnel.  If  one  reads  both  the
Ncholo report and the Presidential Review Commission report, the  well-known
Maphai report, then clearly the issue that is confronting provinces  is  the
issue of skilled personnel. In some of these provinces we have  a  mismatch.
We have personnel that are called additional to the establishment,  but  who
cannot occupy the critical posts.

This is a result of the Bantustan system, which  is  the  product  of  these
fellows -  or  these  hon  members,  rather.  Sorry  for  that.  [Laughter.]
[Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: It was those comrades you appointed.

Mr E GODONGWANA (Eastern  Cape):  Not  us!  With  regard  to  the  Bantustan
system, Kaizer Matanzima, who was working with those hon  members,  employed
tractor drivers. We still have the tractor drivers, but  not  the  tractors.
That is how the system was implemented. [Interjections.]

We are still grappling with those questions. There is a focus  on  improving
skills in our province in  terms  of  educators,  pharmacists  and  doctors.
These are some of the people we want to focus on.

In  previous  reviews  we  made  the  point  that  intergovernmental  fiscal
relations  in  South  Africa  was  a  dynamic  and  changing  process   and,
therefore, needed to be harnessed in a more amicable way.  In  this  regard,
it is important,  therefore,  to  highlight  the  challenges  of  the  local
government transformation agenda. There is a growing  trend  internationally
which suggests that the devolution of functions to local government  becomes
a critical area, and the rationale for this  is  that  efficiency  could  be
achieved at that level. In our case, having successfully transformed 843  to
284 municipalities, that challenge  has  become  acute  and  our  challenge,
therefore, is to make sure that we can transform these local governments  to
be efficient and effective.

At the same time, I also agree with the hon Mkhaliphi that  we  should  move
swiftly to transfer powers and functions to those levels to the extent  that
they can best perform at that level. Again, we should not  use  that  as  an
excuse. I am mindful of the fact that people will say we  do  not  have  the
capacity, and that we cannot transform the functions. My  view  is  that  we
need to transform the  functions,  and,  concomitant  with  that,  begin  to
assist the municipalities with capacity. I also agree with  the  hon  Ralane
that that, of necessity, should follow the principle we have established  in
this intergovernmental framework so that  as  we  move  the  functions,  the
funds must follow.
I would like just to conclude by echoing the sentiments of my colleague  who
was  here  yesterday,  MEC  Kondlo.  UmaDlamini  highlighted  some  of   the
important issues, and I think it is quite important to restate that. One  of
these issues is that, in order to  make  sure  that  this  intergovernmental
process has integrity and functions properly, we need  to  do  a  couple  of
things. One of the challenges that we are facing  as  provincial  government
is the following. She made reference to table 1.1 ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I am afraid that your time has  expired,
hon member. [Applause.] I know that Mr Godongwana did not expect  that  from
me, but I was instructed by the previous holder of this Chair. [Laughter.]

Mr M J KUSCUS (North West): Chairperson, Ministers present  here  today,  my
colleagues, MECs from the various provinces and all members  of  the  House,
following the poetic and passionate and somehow romantic exposition  of  the
MEC from the Free State local government and the input made by my  colleague
from the Eastern Cape to bring a rural perspective to the  debate,  my  task
has been made relatively easy this afternoon.

This afternoon we are busy debating  in  this  House  the  Intergovernmental
Fiscal Review, a document that bears testimony to the  collective  successes
of Government in the area of  fiscal  management  over  the  last  financial
year. But, as we enter this process of measuring or  gauging  our  successes
and the gaps in the delivery of services to our people, it will  perhaps  be
of assistance to us if we heed the words of a wise  president  of  the  USA,
Franklin D Roosevelt, who once stated:


  The future lies with those wise political leaders who  realise  that  the
  great public is interested more in good government than in politics.

Presented to this House, we have the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review,  which
is an attempt to  enhance  good  government  in  this  country,  because  it
accentuates the whole constitutional principle of transparency and  enhances
Government's level of accountability to the populace, and  also  articulates
Government's motives and intentions much more clearly to  the  wider  public
out there.

What distinguishes South Africa from  its  counterparts  in  the  developing
world is our decisiveness in dealing with fiscal matters  in  this  country.
Yes, after the aftermath of 11 September, we clearly see how many  countries
had to run helter-skelter to  beef  up  their  economies,  and  bring  about
macroeconomic stability. But in our country,  through  very  prudent  fiscal
management, we are weathering a very difficult time much more confidently.

Our Government has always engaged  itself  in  those  activities  that  will
result in economic growth to improve the lives  of  the  majority  of  South
Africans, by  both  raising  their  living  standards  and  enhancing  their
economic power.

For the North West province, we would just  like  to  highlight  two  issues
reflected in the Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review.  The  one  issue  is  the
cross cutting matter around human resource development.  On  average,  57,3%
of provincial budgets goes into personnel expenditure. In  the  North  West,
close to 59% of our budget goes into personnel expenditure. What  comes  out
very clearly in this review  is  that  we  are  dealing  here  with  a  very
distorted skills mix, and given  the  deep  rural  nature  of  some  of  our
provinces, and the manner  in  which  this  co-exists  with  low  levels  of
infrastructure,  it  fundamentally  impacts  on  our  ability   to   deliver
services.

Therefore, we need to very seriously look at the whole  rationalisation  and
restructuring of the Public Service because, in a  rural  province  such  as
the North West, as the fiscal review reflects  here,  there  is  a  critical
shortage of professionals such as doctors, nurses, social workers  and  even
certain categories of educators in maths, science and so on.  Just  to  give
an example, in relation to specialists, there are only 1,5  specialists  per
100 000 of the population, as compared to a province such as Gauteng,  where
there are 30,9, and the  Western  Cape,  with  38,5.  There  are  only  12,5
doctors to 100 000 of the population, compared to Gauteng  where  there  are
36 doctors per 100 000 and the Western Cape's 37,2.

Given the human development index of the North West, where we  have  a  high
illiteracy rate of 44%, and infant mortality  rates  of  43  per  1000  live
births, Government must critically look at an incentive package so  that  we
deal with these inequalities in our skills base. There is no way we will  be
able to attract professionals into our deeply rural areas without us  having
incentives to get them  to  go  there.  If  we  do  not  do  that,  we  will
perpetuate some of these things which we have inherited from the past.

In terms of local government and  these  newly  established  structures,  we
still continue to witness a  relatively  smooth  transition  into  this  new
system. A fundamental component linked to the success of this new  municipal
system is the ability of municipalities  to  generate  new  and  alternative
sources  of  income  and  revenue.  We  welcome  the  introduction  of   the
integrated  development  plans,  because  they   will   ensure   sustainable
development of the communities on the ground.

Our observation, however, is that the interim IDPs, though noble in  intent,
do not always link up to fiscal realities and a lot of work still  needs  to
be done to quantify these IDPs  into  realistic  fiscal  projections.  These
IDPs have been identified as  a  vehicle  which  is  going  to  serve  as  a
catalyst to local economic development, and we would like to see a  vigorous
assault on the skills base of these local governments, because if the  local
governments are not properly capacitated with  good  financial  skills,  the
whole notion of accelerated local development will be a wasted idea.

We would like  to  see  these  more  as  challenges  than  as  obstacles  to
development. To overcome some of these problems  and  challenges  that  this
new set of structures is facing as a result of the amalgamation process,  we
see that it becomes essential that we synergise the financial years  of  all
spheres of government. One cannot have a situation  where  local  government
still budgets from 1 July till 30 June, while the rest of the  spheres  have
another cycle.

In terms of the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review we will  then  have  a  more
realistic comparison of Government's delivery processes in  totality  across
all spheres of government, and we can then compare,  more  accurately,  what
has been going on in a specific period of time in our fiscal year.

We, from the  North  West  province,  would  this  afternoon  also  like  to
acknowledge the invaluable role played by the Minister of  Finance  and  his
team, commonly known as ``Team Finance''. [Time expired.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Minister Manuel, there was no intention  on  my
part to stop the member just at that point.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: I will check next time. [Laughter.]

Mr L D MARKOVITZ (Western Cape): Chairperson, it is always a pleasure to  be
at the NCOP, and I thank you for the invitation to be here. I did  not  come
here prepared to speak politics, but I want  to  react  to  the  opportunity
given to me by my colleague  from  the  Eastern  Cape.  I  want  to  ask  my
colleague of the Eastern Cape: Is it going to take  seven  years,  seventeen
years or seventy years to  deal  with  the  question  of  excuses  based  on
history? [Interjections.]

I would have rather expected my colleague of the  Eastern  Cape  to  perhaps
address the NCOP on why they have not spent some R250 million  allocated  to
them for the building of classrooms. [Interjections.] I might say that I  am
not 400 years old, but having said that, it is a pleasure to be here.

The Treasury is to be congratulated - I will deal  with  my  congratulations
at the beginning so I cannot be cut off at the end - on the production of  a
very comprehensive and  useful  overview  of  the  financial  condition  and
service-delivery performance of the three spheres of  government.  It  is  a
most  welcome  step  forward  in  Government's  commitment   to   open   and
transparent fiscal management, and contributes  considerably  to  a  greater
understanding of the complex financial and institutional relationships  that
bind national, provincial and local government.

I believe, however, that this exercise in accountability  would  be  greatly
enhanced were the review to be accompanied by a  briefer  summary  document,
which would enable citizens to measure  the  performance  of  their  elected
representatives in a more accessible and readable manner. As it  stands  now
this  document  is  simply  too  detailed  and   indigestible   for   public
consumption. A simple  guide  to  intergovernmental  relations  would  be  a
valuable tool in the hands of ordinary people who  are  not  well-versed  in
the complexities of fiscal transfers and  equitable  shares,  but  desire  a
better understanding of how government works.

Let me turn  to  two  sections  of  the  review  which  have  long  been  of
particular interest  and  concern  to  me:  taxation  powers  and  borrowing
powers.

While I accept that the collection  of  revenues  from  existing  provincial
sources could, in  many  instances,  be  greatly  improved  upon,  I  remain
convinced that those provinces which have demonstrated effective  management
of both their income and expenditure should be entitled to  explore  further
revenue sources with greater elasticity and creativity.

An HON MEMBER: You always want power.

Mr L D MARKOVITZ: Funny you should say that. There is also a  pressing  need
to accelerate the process of identifying appropriate provincial tax  options
and including  them  on  the  allowed  list.  This  matter  has  been  under
consideration for several years, and it  is  unsatisfactory  that  efficient
and well-managed provinces should be further penalised  while  the  Treasury
grapples with the possible problems which will be posed by  provinces  which
are  less  able  to  efficiently  manage  budgeting  and   cash   management
processes.

Secondly, I welcome the review's encouraging comments regarding  the  urgent
need for a legal and regulatory framework to  govern  provincial  borrowing.
Again,  however,  this  appears  to  be  a   case   where   concerns   about
underperforming provinces are handicapping the  needs  of  those  provinces,
such as the Western Cape and Gauteng, which are able to support an  increase
in  debt  servicing  costs  and  to  meet  the  necessary  budget  reporting
obligations.

An HON MEMBER: Do you know Khayelitsha?

Mr L D MARKOVITZ: I have most probably been there more often than you  have.


Annexure A4  offers  an  interesting  and  insightful  look  at  the  future
development of our intergovernmental systems. It is suggested  that  we  can
either move towards a highly centralised system,  with  provincial  activity
tightly constrained by national laws and  regulations,  or  towards  one  in
which provinces could be granted greater discretion over  both  expenditures
and revenue sources as their capacity develops.

There can be no doubt in my mind as to the direction we  should  be  taking.
If interpreted with a view to maximum decentralisation of powers,  functions
and financial rights, the Constitution  contains  substantial  opportunities
for enabling legislation instruments,  which  will  give  to  the  provinces
greater powers of both taxation and borrowing, and a  substantial  reduction
in conditional grants in favour of  equitable  share.  Following  this  path
would be entirely in keeping with contemporary global  trends,  whereby  the
devolution of governance to the lowest possible subnational levels  is  seen
not only as a powerful guarantor of financial and political  accountability,
but as  an  important  step  towards  restoring  public  confidence  in  the
processes that govern them.

The provinces have been  given  wide-ranging  responsibilities,  whether  as
agents of national Government,  whether  supporting  and  strengthening  the
capacity of local government, or whether executing their own functions  such
as the building and maintenance of  roads,  providing  health  services  and
supplying educational facilities. The extent to  which  we  succeed  in  the
discharging of these obligations would depend on the resources and  revenue-
enhancing opportunities which that sphere of government is allowed.

The review before us makes it clear that more prudent financial  management,
better budgeting and  improved  planning  have  resulted  in  a  substantial
turnaround of provincial  finances.  Likewise,  this  change  in  provincial
fortunes has laid down a solid foundation for accelerated  service  delivery
and improved quality of services.

That is precisely the  positive  environment  which  the  Minister  and  his
department  should  regard  as  an   opportunity   to   empower   provincial
governments, such as the Western Cape, to assign to  them  greater  autonomy
over their financial affairs, and to grant them the means  to  get  on  with
the   business   of   social   upliftment,   community    development    and
infrastructural expansion.

Of course, this must be a two-way  commitment.  The  Minister  is  perfectly
correct in his insistence that greater taxation and borrowing powers to  the
provinces must be accompanied by improved provincial standards of  financial
housekeeping,  information  systems  and   budgetary   responsibility.   The
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review demonstrates that these conditions  are,  at
least, being met, and that most provinces  are  entering  a  new  period  of
stability and maturity.

The turnabout and our manifest commitment to financial prudence must now  be
rewarded.  I  accept  the  inevitability  of  incremental  movement  towards
enhanced provincial powers, but ways must now be found  to  speed  up  these
processes of departmental  investigation  and  legislative  initiative  with
which we have been toying for far  too  long.  The  provinces  are  not  the
stepchildren or mere  administrative  agents  of  the  national  Government.
Rather, they constitute a legislative and executive sphere of government  in
their  own  right,  charged  with  a  host  of  mandates  and  developmental
obligations.

Respect our constitutional rights, honour our  legitimate  expectations  and
strengthen our ability  to  bring  a  better  life  to  all  the  people  we
represent and serve. For our part we shall continue  to  govern  wisely  and
well, but only if we are furnished with the tools and  the  financial  means
to do so.

Cllr D MASEMOLA (Salga): Chairperson, hon  Ministers  and  Deputy  Minister,
members of the  executive  councils,  members  of  this  House  and  special
delegates, I would like to begin by thanking,  firstly,  the  Department  of
Finance for having  been  able  to  produce  this  Intergovernmental  Fiscal
Review report, and then the NCOP, and the select  committee  in  particular,
for the hard work they have done to put forward these issues that are  being
debated today.

It is the first Intergovernmental Fiscal Review  debate  after  the  immense
changes to the system of local government and the December  2000  elections.
Indeed, as so well indicated in the report, local government is  faced  with
a  number  of  challenges  which  alone  cannot  be  addressed  without  the
assistance of other spheres of  government.  As  the  sphere  of  government
closest to the people, it is tasked with the major challenge  of  delivering
basic services. This role  needs  to  be  perfected,  and  we  want  to  see
ourselves performing it to our utmost best.

It has been  indicated,  though,  that  one  municipality  in  the  country,
specifically Thembisile, went for some  days  without  water,  and  that  is
attributed to the fact that there are  constraints  in  the  horizontal  co-
operation  systems  within  our  municipalities.  That  problem  has  really
indicated a need for a strengthened multijurisdictional service provider  in
areas where our local authorities do not  have  the  necessary  capacity  to
provide  services.  That  is  a  problem  which  exists  in  a   number   of
municipalities throughout the country.

On 9 February 2001, the President said:


  The new structure of local government in urban and rural  areas  will  be
  the  focal  institution  of  government  to   ensure   the   co-ordinated
  implementation of our programmes ...

The final phase of local government transition has  therefore  substantially
changed  the  institutional  character   of   municipalities   through   the
redemarcation  of  municipal  boundaries  and  the  new   structural   forms
introduced by the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Structures  Act.  In  this
context, and also in  ensuring  the  finance  management  systems  of  local
government, it becomes  very  important  that  these  systems  enhance  good
governance, effective and efficient management and  cost-efficiency  in  the
way in which municipalities run their finances.

The local  government  transition  and  transformation  have  increased  the
fiscal and financial pressures faced by  municipal  government  in  general.
The December 2000 elections have introduced a range of challenges  faced  by
municipalities. Some of  these  are  mentioned  in  the  report.  They  are,
however, worth mentioning.  One  would  say  the  following:  the  costs  of
establishing these new municipal structures and systems as a result  of  the
demarcation and new legislation; the provision of free basic  services;  the
responsibilities to address the poverty and developmental  challenges  faced
by  local  communities;  addressing  the  legacy  of  apartheid;  increasing
participation and accountability in local governance; and the  reduction  of
budgets, where some municipalities at the  moment  are  forced  to  retrench
their employees. These challenges faced by municipalities are  enormous  and
therefore our presentation is seen in the spirit of  fostering  co-operative
governance with an attempt to provide as much in the  way  of  resources  as
possible for us to address the problems referred to.

The  integrated  development  planning  processes  or  plans  are  the  most
powerful   participative   and   consultative   instruments   to   formulate
development priorities at  local  level,  to  strengthen  the  link  between
community needs and spending priorities. It is therefore critical  that  the
national and provincial spending priorities should be located  within  these
plans, with a view to maximising the allocation of resources and  addressing
the needs identified by the local communities.

In the same context, the actualisation of the Integrated  Sustainable  Rural
Development  Strategy  and  Urban   Renewal   Programme   as   a   strategic
intervention mechanism to make available as much in the way of resources  as
possible should  be  accommodated  in  the  appropriation  of  resources  to
maximise attention to these identified areas.

This  review  takes  into  account  the  enormous  fiscal  burden  that  the
financing of free basic services has on local government. We  therefore  see
a  need  for  a  source  of  funding  to  be  identified  to  assist   these
municipalities to address  the  possibilities  of  budgeting  overheads.  We
think that it would be very important that, in as  much  as  these  services
are being provided, at the same time, an alternative fund be made  available
to assist these municipalities.

Secondly, a national study with regard to the  subsidisation  of  the  poor,
over and above the concept  of  free  basic  services  for  all,  should  be
undertaken within all municipalities to determine the  extent  thereof,  and
find a way of addressing the  social  needs  and  problems  that  the  rural
communities are facing throughout the country.

Local  government  cannot  ignore  its  key  responsibility  of  social  and
economic development. While a significant amount of these costs  are  funded
through local taxes,  a  vast  number  of  municipalities  do  not  have  an
adequate tax base to address all  these  challenges.  Therefore,  again,  an
alternative source of revenue should be identified to finance  the  gaps  in
social and economic development that are faced by municipalities.

We acknowledge the work done by Treasury and support the rationalisation  of
conditional  grants  to  local  government  and  the   proposed   three-year
allocation of grants to municipalities. We also acknowledge and support  the
National Treasury on the  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework  in  order  to
effect proper planning of municipal services because this  will  enable  our
municipalities to allocate their  resources  and  plans  in  line  with  the
available resources that would be availed to them from national Government.

While the role  of  central  and  provincial  government  in  financing  new
infrastructure is acknowledged, the  maintenance  thereof  in  future  years
will create a  major  additional  burden  for  local  government,  and  will
further constrain the limited resources mentioned above.

Accordingly, we need to  consider  how  to  ensure  the  sustainability  and
further maintenance of those facilities with  the  limited  resources  which
municipalities, at the moment, would be able to  provide  to  maintain  that
infrastructure.

The equitable shares to  the  district  municipalities  are  quite  central,
precisely  given  the  lack  of  capacity  of   some   of   these   district
municipalities and the fact that some of them are still  new  and  that,  as
such, there is no way in which they can fund their own programmes. We  think
that, through this process,  some  means  should  be  developed  to  further
allocate these  resources  through  the  equitable  share  such  that  these
district municipalities are also able  to  implement  their  own  plans  and
programmes.

In conclusion, regarding what has been anticipated by  the  White  Paper  on
the creation of strong  district  governments  throughout  the  country,  we
think that that policy commitment should be carried forward. For  us  to  be
able to realise  that,  we  need  to  finalise  the  whole  process  on  the
devolution of powers and functions to these respective  institutions.  That,
probably, should be coupled with enough resources for  these  structures  to
start exercising their own given mandate.

Therefore, if that can be achieved, we hope that  the  two  major  strategic
intervention policy programmes, the ISRDS and the Urban  Renewal  Programme,
will indeed be realised and impact quite positively on  the  improvement  of
the lives of our own people, particularly in those rural areas.

In conclusion, we therefore would like to thank this House for  having  been
able to interact with this document and we believe  that,  probably,  as  we
continue with the implementation, the communities will  be  better  off  and
their lives improved. [Applause.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson,  municipalities  are  constitutionally  charged
with the responsibility of providing essential services to their  residents.
This  obligation  is  directly  linked  to  the  availability  of   adequate
resources.   At   present   most   municipalities   experience   cash   flow
difficulties, partly due to the emerged culture of nonpayment for  services,
a situation which might develop into a state of anarchy.

Most poor municipalities, particularly the rural, can hardly generate  funds
to enable themselves to execute their constitutional  obligations.  Projects
such  as  the  provision  of  strategic  infrastructure  that  will  promote
economic  development  and  the  upgrading  and  continuous  maintenance  of
municipal  infrastructure  require  not  only  skills  and  capacity.  Heavy
financial capital will rather have to be  injected  into  municipalities  in
order to realise these objectives.

Poor and rural municipalities exist in abject  poverty.  The  high  rate  of
unemployment coupled with the scourge of HIV/Aids which targets the poverty-
stricken sector of our society will  continuously  exacerbate  the  economic
status of our rural municipalities.

Being a bona fide resident of one of  these  poor  rural  municipalities,  I
wish  to  commend  the  national  Government   for   having   budgeted   for
intergovernmental transfers, which will be the major source of  revenue  for
the municipalities. However, how long will these  municipalities  depend  on
hand-outs? This is nothing but a maintenance grant similar to that given  to
the poor children under the age of seven.
Municipalities therefore have to utilise the  funds  sparingly  and  with  a
high degree of accountability. The fact that transfers are the  main  source
of  rural  municipal  revenue   poses   great   challenges   to   the   poor
municipalities. The administrative staff and the councillors  will  have  to
demonstrate a high degree of accountability,  cost-effective  and  efficient
administrative practices and rigorous prioritisation processes.

Lastly, the public-private partnerships funding has shown interest in  those
larger and financially viable municipalities like  Nelspruit,  Richards  Bay
and Dolphin Coast. This private-sector participation  seems  to  be  showing
progress.

In 1998 there was a question from one  of  the  members  of  Parliament  who
wanted to find out whether these  partnerships  would  be  extended  to  the
disadvantaged  sectors  of  our  communities.  The  hon  the  Minister  then
answered that it would. Does this response still hold today? [Applause.]

Ms C S  BOTHA:  Chairperson,  the  latest  IGFR  report  is  a  very  useful
document. It is lucid and logical and contains a wealth  of  information.  I
would like to suggest, contrary to the hon  Markovitz's  proposal,  that  it
even be expanded to a second  volume  with  detailed  information  on  local
government included, but split according to individual metros and local  and
district municipalities.

However, despite all its merits - a rose  by  any  other  name  -  political
representatives  cannot  use  the  IGFR  as  a  substitute  for  independent
evaluation through their personal observations. The reality  on  the  ground
can easily be befuddled by statistical aggregates  and  selective  examples,
as well as the perspective conveyed in nonfinancial comment.

The  report  pertinently  acknowledges  the  challenge  presented  to  local
government to evaluate and manage the impact of fiscal choices. Of  the  284
newly demarcated local authorities it was found that few had budgets  linked
to  their  strategy  priorities.  Clearly,  it   is   no   good   committing
municipalities to improved services,  while  expenditure  is  directed,  not
towards delivery, but increasingly towards  salaries  and  operating  costs.
This is confirmed by the fact that 78% of municipal  costs  are  operational
and only 22% are for capital projects. Salaries  continue  to  make  up  the
largest share of this expenditure, 31%, and continue  to  rise  faster  than
inflation and budget growth.

The new demarcation which necessitates  the  equalisation  of  salaries,  no
doubt at the highest level, will also add to this cost in the  same  way  as
council remuneration is likely to rise  towards  the  maximum  upper  limits
provided. Whilst the number of councillors has  decreased  by  30%,  council
remuneration has already increased by 55% since pre-1999.

Additionally, the report highlights  the  failure  of  councils  to  collect
budgeted revenue and to refrain from incurring irresponsible expenditure.  I
have recently seen the appointment of administrative and political staff  to
new councils  in  the  Free  State  with  back-dated  gravy-train  salaries,
regardless of the fact that these choices pushed the municipal  budget  into
the red.

At the same time steps have not been taken to increase debt  collection.  On
the contrary, this has been postponed. On  the  other  hand,  municipalities
are also at the receiving end of political  choices  over  which  they  have
little say, the best example currently being the 1999  election  promise  to
deliver free basic services to all.

The compilers of the review have  tried  to  rationalise  this  compromising
promise through some creative phrasing using the  following  wording:  ``The
policy commitment has sometimes been understood as free basic  services  for
all.'' I say: bunkum! Politicians  had  no  such  reserves  when  they  were
wooing the electorate and I hope this kind of political fine-tuning will  in
future be avoided.

While the  report  reflects  a  Treasury  approach  which  places  financial
disciplines squarely at the heart of  responsible  delivery,  we  need  much
more. We need the speedy implementation of financial and budget reforms  and
politically responsible choices. [Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson,  I  am  not  going  to  waste  members'  time,
because many of the  issues  I  wanted  to  cover  have  been  covered  very
extensively.

May I once again request this Chamber to approve the  report  as  tabled  in
the ATC yesterday. It is not a perfect set of  documents,  but  I  think  we
have tried our best to capture the discussions in the public hearings.

The 2001 IGFR has provided us with a good set of information which  must  be
used to measure Government's performance.  Sectors  covered  in  the  review
consumed a lot of  resources  from  the  fiscus  because  they  are  labour-
intensive. In tables 7.1 and 7.2 in the review it  is  clearly  stated  that
personnel continues to consume a lot of resources despite  the  decrease  in
personnel expenditure. This trend is expected to  stabilise  over  the  MTEF
period.

I will skip other issues.

The review also states that provinces are no  longer  having  problems  with
their overdrafts. Instead they have budget surpluses which  are  being  used
to finance capital  programmes  and  further  increase  spending  on  social
services.

In our view the surplus may reflect the lack of spending by departments  and
provinces or may be because departments overestimated their  budget  at  the
time. We would like to have more information on the issue.

We hope that moving towards the full implementation of  the  PFMA,  we  will
address some of these problems. The move from  cash  accounting  to  accrual
accounting may address these issues.

We know there are national norms and standards for the  provision  of  basic
services. Provinces and local spheres of government, in some  instances,  do
not follow these norms and standards.  For  example,  in  some  areas  where
Government provides R16 000 to build a house, local government  may  provide
R23 000. There is no matching grant in between to get to that standard.

If provinces or local governments have higher norms, they  should  be  in  a
position to match those grants to provide services to the  people  who  need
them, like the hostels in Gauteng  which  were  renovated  and  turned  into
family units.

During the  public  hearings  it  became  clear  that,  in  some  instances,
communities are not consulted in the construction of  infrastructure.  Hence
some of them have become white elephants without people utilising  them.  We
think that communities should play a critical role because they  may  prefer
one route to another. We also  think  that  communities  are  concerned  and
their cultures must be taken into account.

In some provinces, there are communities that do not believe that they  must
have one house with everything in it. They want to  have  houses  which  are
divided into a toilet, kitchen  and  bedroom  separately  built.  All  these
issues must be taken into consideration when one builds  infrastructure  for
communities.

In this  democratic  Government,  we  must  try  to  pursue  the  integrated
developmental approach, through both the rural integrated strategy  and  the
Urban Renewal Strategy. This will help in the sense that when  these  houses
are built, clean  and  safe  water,  electricity,  sanitation  and  sewerage
systems, schools, transport, roads and clinics will be provided.  All  these
will contribute positively towards the development of our community,  unlike
what apartheid did. This will help  to  instil  dignity  and  pride  in  our
communities.

Revenue generation continues to be a problem and a legacy to both  provinces
and municipalities. Although provinces do not have a huge  fiscal  capacity,
the  very  little  that  they  collect  will  make  a  huge  difference.  In
considering the Provincial Tax Regulation Bill, the  capacity  of  provinces
to collect revenue  becomes  very  relevant.  Municipalities  must  increase
their capacities to collect and those who have low  fiscal  capacity  should
be helped by either of the two  spheres  of  government  in  line  with  the
developmental agenda as espoused in new municipalities.

For more than 40 years  the  previous  government,  that  is  the  apartheid
government, continued to create a mess  and  dislodge  people.  People  were
divided on the line of race, ethnicity, religion and so  forth.  Today  when
one looks at Sandton and Alexandra, then one can see  the  clear  mess  that
apartheid created. To redress the imbalances that exist in  Alexandra  alone
will take more than 40 years.

I wish to thank the Ministry and all communities who participated.  We  hope
that in future the document will be released in time so as to allow  members
ample  time  to  engage  and  formulate  the  report.  This  would  be  very
appropriate. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  PROVINCIAL  AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Chairperson,
Minister Manuel and hon members, I am speaking for the first  time  in  this
House and I feel a bit nervous. I am used to being heckled. [Laughter.]

Mr L D MARKOVITZ (Western Cape): Oh, I can do that! [Laughter.]

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER:  I  want  to  thank  the  House  for  giving  me  the
opportunity  to  address  it  this  afternoon.  I  had  the  opportunity  of
addressing the select committee the other day, and there I was nervous too.

May I just remind this House that in February this year, our  President,  in
his address to the nation, declared that our country and indeed  the  people
of South Africa were moving step by  step  further  away  from  our  painful
past. Our President highlighted the fact that we wanted to move our  economy
onto a higher economic  growth  path,  increasing  our  competitiveness  and
efficiency, raising employment levels and reducing  poverty  and  persistent
inequalities.

At  the  heart  of  creating  a  stable  economy  and  good  governance  lie
intergovernmental  relations   and   co-operative   governance,   which   is
entrenched in our Constitution and  aims  at  ensuring  that  the  national,
provincial and local spheres of government work together  in  achieving  our
objective, which is a better life for all.

The Intergovernmental Fiscal Review, which provides us  with  a  budget  and
spending   information   in   all   sectors   managed   by   provinces   and
municipalities, should be able to assist us in  assessing  any  progress  we
are making in achieving these goals we have set for ourselves.

This review follows the decision by national Government to place  the  local
government sphere at the core of our mandate to improve  the  lives  of  our
people, the  disadvantaged  and  rural  poor  in  particular.  However,  our
movement towards creating a better life  for  our  people  comes  with  huge
responsibilities in terms  of  ensuring  that  local  authorities  have  the
capacity to deliver services to each and every household in their areas.
Our President also emphasised that the new structure  of  local  government,
in urban and rural areas, would be the focal institution to ensure  the  co-
ordinated implementation  of  Government's  programmes.  To  this  end,  the
Government  has  adopted  the  Integrated  Sustainable   Rural   Development
Programme and the Urban Renewal Programme. Cabinet, in its wisdom, has  also
delegated the task of co-ordinating the implementation of  these  programmes
across all three spheres of government to the Ministry  and  the  Department
of Provincial and Local Government.

This Ministry and the Department of Provincial and  Local  Government  have,
therefore, taken on this challenge. The  Ministry  and  the  department  are
conscious of the fact that the immediate task  is  the  development  of  the
capacity of local government. This is critical  for  the  success  of  these
programmes.

The very nature of these programmes - integrated, sustainable - require  all
departments, national and provincial,  and  indeed  the  municipalities,  to
reprioritise their budgets in order to accelerate the  provision  of  better
services at a local level.

The challenge facing us is that of strengthening our  local  authorities  in
order for them to succeed in their  efforts  to  better  the  lives  of  our
people. Already the Treasury has allocated R65 million  -  I  wish  it  were
dollars - to boost the institutional ...  [Interjections.]  [Laughter.]  ...
and structural capacity of all the district councils responsible for the  13
nodal areas which were identified for the  first  phase  of  the  Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Programme.

We must accept  that  the  principles  of  good  governance,  effective  and
efficient management and cost-efficiency are also critical for  the  success
of local government. We cannot just  consider  the  recommendations  of  the
fiscal review without taking  into  account  the  fact  that  we  have  just
recently transformed our system of local government.

The  Local  Government:  Municipal  Structures  Act   of   1998   introduced
operational changes, and, parallel to that, the financial systems  of  local
government will be reformed when we introduce the Bill on municipal  finance
management, budget reforms and the generally accepted  municipal  accounting
practice policy framework. This will mean a very sharp  learning  curve  for
some of our municipalities.

The fiscal review points out that only a few of  the  284  newly  demarcated
local authorities have linked their budgets to  their  strategic  priorities
in terms of improving the services they provide to our  people.  However,  I
am privileged to report to the House today that we  have  now  received  the
integrated development plans from all of the 284  municipalities.  Following
discussions with our provincial and local government counterparts,  we  have
set February 2002 as our first  deadline  to  measure  our  key  performance
areas through physical and visual output. As  the  Minister  for  Provincial
and Local Government would put it, we want  to  see  visible  outputs.  Next
week we will also be launching performance indicators and support packs  for
local government.
The IDPs will primarily shift the focus of  municipalities  towards  better-
integrated  and  sustainable  delivery,  nationally  co-ordinated   by   the
Department of Provincial and Local  Government.  Our  new  system  of  local
government, with the guidance of IDPs, will definitely contribute towards  a
shift in budgetary priorities as the fiscal review suggests.

No longer will we see  most  of  our  budgets  being  spent  on  the  actual
administration of local authorities. We will  witness  a  fundamental  shift
towards spending on  development  projects  in  communities,  to  assist  in
developing local economies  that  will  ultimately  contribute  towards  the
strengthening  of  our  national  economy.   Through   these   IDPs,   local
authorities will also be able to clearly  define  moneys  collected  through
actual service delivery.

Also of  particular  importance  is  the  extension  and  rehabilitation  of
municipal infrastructure.  Not  only  will  this  extend  municipal  service
delivery, but it will also have positive spin-offs  for  economic  activity.
However,  municipalities  with  high  levels  of  underservicing  also  lack
capacity to address their infrastructure challenges rapidly.

Two weeks ago, our Minister of Finance, Minister  Trevor  Manuel,  addressed
this House. He indicated  that  the  advances  made  in  transforming  local
government were substantial and added that the fiscal conditions to  support
developmental municipalities were taking shape.

It is our belief that consolidated local  municipalities  will,  in  future,
manage their budgets more efficiently. Our Constitution defines this  sphere
of government as developmental in nature. This means that  local  government
is an important agent for delivery of services, but it is  also  crucial  to
the social and economic upliftment of our people.

Through the  IDPs,  local  government,  in  conjunction  with  national  and
provincial governments, public  and  civil  society  organisations  and  the
private  sector  will  take  on  increasing  responsibilities  for   service
delivery. IDPs set out the vision, needs, priorities, goals  and  strategies
of a local municipality, to develop the community it serves. It  provides  a
framework in consultation with communities  for  determining  its  budgetary
priorities.

Through our new system of local government, it is essential that our  people
become  actively  involved  in  deciding  how  they  are   governed.   While
encouraging municipalities to develop a culture  of  consultation,  our  new
system also encourages local people to actively participate in  the  process
of deciding how they are governed.

From the start, we have said that in view of the  introduction  of  our  new
system of local government, we also had to review the finances allocated  to
this sphere  of  government.  This  includes  the  equitable  share  of  the
national revenue, the proposed new Local Government:  Property  Rates  Bill,
district council levies, intergovernmental grants, the restructuring of  the
electricity industry, private and public  partnerships  and  local  economic
development.

Finally, we  must  look  at  the  transformation  of  our  system  of  local
government as an investment in the economic  and  social  structure  of  the
type of society we wish to establish. Through active participation in  local
government structures, communities will shape their own destinies.

The   democracy   we   are   considering   consolidating   imposes   certain
responsibilities on our people. It demands of  them  to  contribute  towards
the stabilisation of the economy of  their  communities,  through  assisting
the police in the fight against crime, through maintaining  the  quality  of
local facilities and through contributing towards municipal services.

For local government to be effective, we have to ask all South  Africans  to
play their part and to pay for services provided by our  municipalities,  as
this will contribute towards stable and effective local government.
We have set ourselves a number of challenges, but these are  all  driven  by
one objective, that of creating a  better  life  for  all  our  people.  The
people in turn have mandated us the task of facilitating  this.  This  is  a
huge and complex task that will take time to achieve,  but  we  cannot  fail
them. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson and members, firstly, I would  like  to
express my appreciation. The task that we set for ourselves with  regard  to
attempting to initiate discussions on the IGFR  in  the  way  that  we  have
handled it here was, certainly, a complex one. But I think that  other  than
the conclusion and a few little glitches that the hon Mahlangu  referred  to
in the report,  as  printed  in  the  ATC,  it  is  a  task  that  has  been
exceedingly well accomplished. I want to express appreciation and say why  I
think so.

It is a complex task because it involves,  firstly,  the  select  committees
here, sister  committees  in  provincial  legislatures,  representatives  of
provincial and national government, and, last  but  not  least,  the  active
participation of Salga.

This kind of oversight function has not, to the  best  of  my  recollection,
been undertaken yet. So - I think it is for that that  the  NCOP  should  be
commended.

Clearly, the task is about exercising policy choice. In order to do  so,  it
is imperative that we recognise that policy manoeuvrability  is  limited  by
circumstances. Part of that circumstance is  the  history  of  a  particular
part of the country. Unless we  deal  with  that,  we  will  be  like  trees
without roots, because the circumstances that face underdeveloped  parts  of
the country are very different from those that face provinces  such  as  the
Western Cape and Gauteng.

I dare say that many of us would have buckled  under  the  load  imposed  on
somebody like MEC Godongwana when he came into office  and  we  slapped  him
with section 101(a) of the Constitution and asked him to turn the  situation
around from the most dire circumstances. Many would  have  buckled  at  that
kind of challenge, but I think it is in dealing with that that we  begin  to
understand what policy manoeuvrability is. I think  that  those  issues  are
well reflected in the changes that do come through  in  the  various  tables
that  are  published  and  they  were,  I  am  sure,  reflected  on  in  the
discussions here.

One of the two key questions that we asked at the start of  this  discussion
was: Does co-operative governance work? It is  a  complex  arrangement.  One
should look at some of the areas  that  create  more  stress  in  provincial
budgets like welfare payments, both to the aged and the  disabled,  and  the
child support grants, and all of the decisions taken at national  level.  We
then say to provinces they have to finance  these  out  of  their  equitable
share. Dealing with the issue, as a chapter in the IGFR attempts to - and  I
am sure the discussion in the workshops here  attempted  that  -  brings  us
closer to answering the question: Does co-operative governance work?

The second question that the hon Botha posed - not  the  Botha  who  is  the
Deputy Minister, but the other Botha in the House - is  an  interesting  one
because, as we move forward, we need not engage  with  the  quantum  of  the
spend, but its quality. What happens to  the  money?  How  does  it  get  to
people? What does it do to improve the capabilities of people in  the  fight
against poverty? That is the exceedingly important  challenge,  and  I  will
come back to it in a moment.

We could not conceivably have turned these  two  weeks  of  discussion  only
into a request for more money. It is inappropriate that we should try to  do
those kinds of things in these discussions. Everybody would take  a  bit  of
chance - tata machance, tata mamillions - but the process  of  budgeting  is
quite a different one. [Laughter.] In fact, we had hoped that what  we  have
as a starting point, namely the fiscal framework with its  divisions,  would
be taken as a starting point.  That  fiscal  framework  is  made  up  of  or
arrived at through four interconnected issues.

The first is something that  we  as  the  National  Treasury  placed  before
Cabinet, and that is the macroeconomic framework, which  will  indicate  how
much we have available, in other words how much money we have  to  raise  as
taxes and how much we have to borrow.

The second is the vertical division. Whilst this matter has  been  discussed
and will be discussed in the Budget Council  and  the  Budget  Forum,  where
Salga is present with us, at the end of the day it  is  a  political  choice
that is exercised by Cabinet  in  an  attempt  to  give  expression  to  our
interpretation of constitutional functions and responsibilities.

The third, in the respective provinces, is the horizontal division and  that
is largely influenced by the FFC. I know that some  have  been  saying  that
all that they need to do is to count a few more people  in  their  provinces
and they will get more money. It is a lot more  complex  than  that  because
the formula of the FFC has demographics as  only  one  component.  Services,
backlogs, historic disadvantage - all of those things are factored into  the
equation. They are there, and it is a matter of  public  record.  Certainly,
the Select Committee on Finance here in the NCOP  has  discussed  the  FFC's
recommendations.

I would like to invite all of the members whose interest in  fiscal  matters
has been  raised  in  the  course  of  these  discussions  to  go  back  and
familiarise themselves with how those formulas are arrived at.

The fourth set of issues relates to local government, and this is  the  area
that is facing the most change, because the change from 843 -  I  get  these
numbers wrong all the time - to 242 is not  merely  going  to  be  a  simple
division sum. I think we understand very clearly that with the  demarcation,
there were also very substantial changes in  fiscal  capacity.  The  way  in
which we approach these issues as we go forward is going  to  mean  that  we
must, over the next two years maybe, give ourselves the space to  deal  with
this, to  be  informed  by  the  changes  and  to  ensure  that  the  fiscal
responsibility vests  as  we  make  the  commitment  to  ensure  that  local
authorities are  properly  resourced  to  be  able  to  deliver  free  basic
services and maintain those resources.

Turning to some of the issues that were raised in the discussion: The  first
of those was the references to HIV and Aids. I am quite appreciative of  the
extent of the discussion that  took  place,  not  only  in  the  health  and
welfare meeting but also in plenary here. It is important to  recognise,  as
the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review advises us,  that  over  R4  billion  is
spent by the three spheres  of  government  on  HIV  and  Aids  and  related
illnesses. That is not the heart and soul of this  report  as  some  of  the
press seem to suggest, but it certainly does debunk this notion that  nobody
cares.

The second issue that was raised, and something that is under discussion  at
the moment, is the health conditional grants. Certainly the grants  for  the
provision of tertiary services have been located in some provinces. Part  of
the learning from this exercise here in the NCOP,  going  forward  as  well,
will allow us  to  negotiate  changes  to  the  health  conditional  grants,
because we now understand that some provinces have been  excluded  from  the
tertiary grants, but it is actually crazy to think  that  tertiary  services
are not provided in  those  provinces.  Those  issues  are  currently  being
negotiated between ourselves and the Ministry and Department  of  Health  to
ensure a more even spread. On the timing of changes,  I  think  we  need  to
maximise the sensitivities all round.

I was a bit struck by the very  strong  call  for  increases  in  the  child
support grants, because the increases were called for in  two  directions  -
the first to raise the age to 18 and the second to increase the size of  the
grants. None of us here, I think, is that callous that we  would  not  agree
with the spirit. But I think, at the same time that  we  all  must  put  our
heads together and ask what is affordable  in  a  poor  country  like  South
Africa. When we balance all of our priorities we clearly  come  out  with  a
different set of issues. But that is the stuff that  budgets  are  made  of,
that work is ongoing, and Parliament will be advised of the decisions  taken
in the passage of time.

In respect of something else  that  was  raised  here  on  the  Division  of
Revenue Act, namely local government and  its  ability  to  implement  water
schemes, there were some very strong words raised as well.  I  do  not  take
the view that the fault is either inherently in co-operative  governance  or
in the Division of Revenue Act, because we do indeed need  to  have  certain
safeguards to ensure that money transferred and intended for  infrastructure
is spent on it.

I think this is about learning together,  trying  to  effect  these  changes
going forward, and revisiting the safeguards that are in the legislation.  I
think it may be an error to ignore them entirely  in  the  future.  The  key
challenges, from the reports, are  in  the  nonfinancial  areas,  where  the
hardest decisions, clearly, are going to lie. Here, I think  something  that
was not raised is for all of us  to  be  alive  to  the  difference  between
social expenses, which we can transfer,  and  social  processes,  which  are
quite different.

Democracy is going to  be  strengthened  in  this  country,  because  social
processes have strengthened. Social processes involve communities  at  their
most elementary levels. In this regard, I think that  local  government  and
wards within local government are going  to  be  profoundly  more  important
than the discussions we have in the National Assembly  or  in  the  National
Council of Provinces.

It is through ensuring that the processes happen  that  people  can  receive
issues differently, and in terms of this debate MEC Godongwana often  refers
to relating to income availability in rural areas. This is  also  about  the
capabilities of communities and poor people to be able to change  their  own
lives. It is about doing all of those things. Here,  in  the  discussion,  I
think a number of speakers, fortunately,  since  yesterday  made  the  point
that money is not the only solution. It  is  about  managing  the  resource,
about allowing the  resource  to  take  root  in  the  community  and  about
engendering appropriate responses from the communities. I think  that  those
points raised by colleagues in the House yesterday and  earlier  today  need
to be commended,  because  they  speak  of  the  kind  of  maturity  of  our
responsibility to drive and effect the changes.

I had never hoped that this Intergovernmental Fiscal Review would  become  a
kind of league table of who is good and who is  bad,  because  circumstances
have been quite different. I almost said to the hon Markovitz that  although
he may have good tax-raising  ability,  the  province  is  exceedingly  well
endowed. Many rich people live here. Many industries are located here.  Part
of our responsibility in Government and in Parliament at  a  national  level
is to deal with issues of inequality, and  the  absence  of  opportunity  is
part of inequality.

That is the challenge that we have to work through on a continual  basis.  I
do not know, tongue in cheek, as the hon MEC just lost the mayor. What  else
will he lose if we give it to him next? [Laughter.]  [Interjections.]  These
are issues we have to deal with, because they describe this great  joy  that
we have of building a democracy that is deep, not for ourselves  because  it
must touch the lives of our people in a very tangible kind of way.

In expressing appreciation, let me conclude by saying this first. Though  it
is the third time we have had an Intergovernmental Fiscal Review, it is  the
first time that the discussion has been this intense. It is the  first  time
that we have been able to take away with us a report out  of  this  process.
It adds a perspective, and I want to thank colleagues for that  perspective,
because that perspective is informed by a set of realities that will  always
be different from those of the Treasury, but  enrich  what  we  do.  We  say
thank you very much for that.

The second point to make, in conclusion, is that our budgeting is  cyclical.
We can indicate that around the end of October next year, within  a  day  or
five, there will be an Intergovernmental Fiscal Review. The issues  that  we
take on board now will influence the way in which that is done because  this
is an ongoing process. As I said to my colleagues in Cabinet, though we  had
to give a bit  of  an  extension  this  year  because  of  certain  changes:
``Please know that on 30 June next year I expect  a  letter  from  you  with
your budget submissions for the budget in 2003.'' It is a  cyclical  process
and we all need to engage in it in that kind of way.

Clearly there are changes that are going to  be  a  bit  more  gradual  than
others, but we need to mark those changes and  go  along  with  them  as  we
proceed. We need to watch very  clearly  the  policy  choices.  We  need  to
create more policy room as we spend. This  means  that  we  must  watch  the
efficacy of spending. That  is  the  quality  assurance  that  I  think  all
spheres of government must put into this discussion as we go forward.

I hoped that this exercise would empower the participants  in  the  process.
What we sometimes find is that a few people will say, ``I  will  talk  about
these economic issues,'' while other people  think  that  that  is  not  for
them. But part of what we have tried to do here is to involve  everybody  in
talking about budgets, because it is certainly a key part of  our  political
responsibility. Ensuring that there  are  resources  available  and  how  we
spend them is a key part of our political responsibility.  I  hope  that  we
were able to do that. I hope that all of the members of the NCOP feel a  lot
more empowered.

I know that some of the crafting is still in  this  jargon  that  economists
speak, but I hope that we were able to break that down. I express that  hope
very fervently because I think that this process will  work  if  it  can  be
taken a step forward.

That step forward is, hopefully, that  within  provincial  legislatures  and
within local governments these same discussions can happen  because,  as  we
begin to hold those discussions, we empower  public  representatives,  which
is the objective of the exercise. As public representatives,  are  empowered
they will understand that there is no  magic,  that  a  lot  of  the  debate
around macroeconomics is in fact something on the side. The key we  must  be
looking at is how money is spent to  make  a  difference  in  the  lives  of
people.

Once we are sure of that it  is  then  easier  to  talk  about  the  general
availability of the resource - can we tax more, can we spend more -  because
there are parts of what we see now that do suggest, from time to time,  that
we do not have capacity to spend a lot more.

However, that is taking the exercise forward, and it is in that regard  that
I invite you, as Chairperson of the NCOP and the  distinguished  members  of
this Council, to take the process forward.  But  thank  you  very  much  for
enriching the Budget process as we proceed. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Ke batla go leboga Tona Manuel.  Ke  bone  gore
baemedi botlhe ba ba nang le  seabe  mo  tirong  e,  ba  e  dira  sentle.  E
simolotswe ke Tona Manuel. Re rata go mo leboga. [I would like to thank  the
hon Minister Manuel. I realise that the people  who  are  involved  in  this
task are doing very well. I was initiated by the hon  Minister  Manuel,  and
for that we would like to thank him very much.]

Minister, we thank you for the initiative, which  you  introduced,  allowing
the NCOP to interact seriously with  the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review.
Many  persons  have  been  involved  in  putting   the   process   together,
particularly Mr Surty, but I  think  it  was  excellent  that  you  actually
encouraged the  select  committee  to  ensure  that  we  give  the  detailed
analysis. I am sure that the NCOP will take on the challenge posed  by  this
initiative. Thank you very much.

Debate concluded
