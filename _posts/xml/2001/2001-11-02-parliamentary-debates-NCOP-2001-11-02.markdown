                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms C S BOTHA: Madam Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) believes that for democracy to prosper,  a  healthy  balance  between
       majority and opposition parties is necessary;


  (2) recognises that opposition to the Government cannot be effective from
       within the governing party;


  (3)  recommits  itself  to  government  that  is  principled,  efficient,
       accountable and transparent;


  (4) agrees that elected public representatives must serve  the  interests
       of their voters and not the interests of their pockets; and


  (5)  therefore  calls  on  all  public  representatives   to   rededicate
       themselves to the delivery of services and hope to the homeless,  the
       unemployed, those living with HIV/Aids, the elderly and  the  victims
       of crime.

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I humbly give notice of the following motion:
  That the Council -


  (1) notes with horror the rape of three infants in South  Africa  in  the
       past week;


  (2) expresses its strongest condemnation of this form of violence against
       children, who are the most vulnerable members of our society;


  (3) calls on the judiciary to ensure that the perpetrators of such crimes
       are appropriately punished;


  (4) calls on members of our communities to be vigilant in the  protection
       they offer our children and to report all cases  of  sexual  violence
       against children; and


  (5) requests the Minister of Safety  and  Security  to  ensure  that  the
       services of the Child Protection Units remain an important feature in
       the protective mechanisms the state has in place for the  benefit  of
       our children.

Ms S N NTLABATI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting
of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with extreme displeasure how the DP, in its attempt to preserve
       white privilege, has once again embarked on a  vile,  racist  ``swart
       gevaar'' campaign against the ANC by using coloured leaders to  drive
       a wedge between Africans and coloureds in the Western Cape;


  (2) believes that such tactics are indicative of a desperate and  morally
       bankrupt leadership;


  (3) reminds the DP that the breakup of the DA was not caused by  the  ANC
       but by their own backstabbing;


  (4) further reminds the DP that the only example of bad government in the
       country is happening in a province controlled by the DA; and


  (5) calls on the Premier, Mr Gerald Morkel, to stop  vacillating  and  to
       heed the warnings of his party leader, Marthinus van  Schalkwyk,  and
       other New NP members.

                   FREE ELECTRICITY TO POOR IN NORTH WEST

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, I move without notice -


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that on 30 October 2001 the Minister  of  Minerals  and  Energy
       launched a number of projects around the Mathopestad  area  in  North
       West which will provide free basic energy to the poor;


  (2) further notes that in terms of  these  projects,  households  in  the
       province earning less than R800 per month will  be  given  50  kW  of
       electricity free of charge every month;
  (3) also notes that people in the area will now, for the first time, have
       energy for basic household needs such as cooking and lighting; and


  (4) welcomes these poverty relief projects as yet  another  demonstration
       of the commitment of the ANC to improve the living conditions of  all
       our people.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN BY TEACHERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that when we send our children  to  school  we  send  them  for
       education and proper upbringing in the absence of the parents;


  (2) notes with shock that some teachers take advantage of school children
       and abuse them sexually;


  (3) also notes that such malpractices and exploitation of  children  lead
       to various types of sexually transmitted diseases;


  (4) notes with sadness that children are not only destroyed  morally  and
       physically, but that some of them are not victims of HIV/Aids; and


  (5) therefore appeals to the Department of Education to  take  steps  and
       precautions to monitor this awful and dreadful misbehaviour  by  some
       teachers.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                         RAPE OF NINE-MONTH-OLD BABY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with great sadness and shock the case in  which  six  men  aged
       between 24 and 66 allegedly raped a baby of nine months  in  Upington
       in the Northern Cape;


  (2) expresses its grave concern over such a heinous act  of  such  utmost
       savagery;


  (3) is of the opinion that such an act was meant  to  completely  destroy
       the life of the child;


  (4) expresses the fact that this contributes  to  lawlessness  and  human
       rights abuse which cannot be tolerated in this country or anywhere in
       the civilised world; and
  (5) commends the South African Police for apprehending the  rapists  with
       quick  efficiency  and  appreciates  our  bail  laws  that  made   it
       impossible for the accused to get bail.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      ONE-STOP CENTRE IN NORTHERN CAPE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) welcomes the opening of a new One-Stop Centre in  the  Northern  Cape
       Town of Colesberg by former  President  Nelson  Mandela  and  Premier
       Manne Dipico;


  (2) notes that this centre will provide a wide range of  social  services
       under one roof, such as  the  issuing  of  identification  documents,
       death certificates, help with  child  maintenance  queries,  domestic
       violence and other social assistance enquiries;


  (3) further notes that, in the past, people had to travel to  De  Aar  to
       get assistance with regard to the above services;


  (4) acknowledges that because of poverty many people could not  find  the
       money to travel this long  distance,  resulting  in  them  having  to
       forego these important services; and


  (5) believes that the establishment of this centre will pave the way  for
       poor people to access the above  services  and  bring  a  qualitative
       improvement to their lives.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    PANSALB CONFERENCE ON MULTILINGUALISM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat die Pansat vandag in Pretoria 'n  konferensie
       aanbied waar veeltaligheid bespreek sal word;


  (2) hulle sterkte en voorspoed toewens;


  (3) verder kennis  neem  dat  bykans  200  taalregteskendings  by  Pansat
       aangemeld is en dat di√© fokusarea van Pansat minder  as  2%  van  die
       begroting ontvang om sy werk te verrig;


  (4) aanbeveel dat die Minister van Kuns, Kultuur, Wetenskap en Tegnologie
       in die lig van die feit dat Pansat sedert April sonder raadslede moet
       funksioneer, hierdie saak ondersoek en vasstel of addisionele  fondse
       vir uitkontraktering nie 'n oplossing is nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council-


  (1) notes that PanSALB is presenting a conference in  Pretoria  today  at
       which multilingual will be discussed;


  (2) wishes them well and everything of the best;


  (3) further notes that about 200 language  rights  violations  have  been
       reported to PanSALB and that the focus area of PanSALB receives  less
       than 2% of the budget with which to do its work; and


  (4)  recommends  that  the  Minister  of  Arts,  Culture,   Science   and
       Technology, in view of the fact that  PanSALB  has  had  to  function
       without board members since April, should investigate this matter and
       determine whether additional funds for purposes  of  contracting  out
       could be a solution.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  SOUTH AFRICA'S HOSTING OF 2002 UN WORLD SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that South Africa has been  chosen  to  host  the  2002  United
       Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development;


  (2) recognises that poverty  poses  the  biggest  threat  to  sustainable
       development due to the instability, conflict, disease and degradation
       that result from it;


  (3) acknowledges the important role our Government is playing in ensuring
       that the summit agenda will give priority to  issues  of  concern  to
       developing countries, such as poverty;


  (4) believes the hosting of the summit in South Africa  is  an  important
       achievement   which   confirms   our   country's   and   Government's
       significance within the global community; and


  (5) further believes that the summit will provide  our  country  and  the
       African continent with  an  opportunity  to  help  shape  a  globally
       defined sustainable development  agenda  firmly  focused  around  the
       reduction of poverty and  which  will  have  an  enormously  positive
       impact on the everyday lives of  millions  of  people  all  over  the
       world.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

              MARKETING OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Madam Chair,  this  is
actually a very interesting Bill which we have  before  the  House.  It  has
received a lot of attention in the National Assembly's  portfolio  committee
and the NCOP's select committee has also given it very close attention,  but
perhaps I should say something about the background to this amending Bill.

One should actually start with the old Marketing Act  of  1968,  which  made
possible a whole system of controls  over  agricultural  products  with  the
assistance of various systems that could be introduced under  that  Act.  In
actual fact it was  a  completely  regulated  system.  It  was  possible  to
regulate the marketing of almost  any  particular  agricultural  product  in
this way. They declared it a  controlled  product  and  then  a  scheme  was
established whereby certain  measures  were  prescribed  for  that  type  of
product. A control board was then put in place for  the  particular  product
to implement the scheme, as it was called, that was created.

There was all types of systems: a surplus  removal  system,  a  floor  price
system, price control, control over quantities of a product  marketed  in  a
particular area, controls over the quality of the  products  that  could  be
sold  and  even  regulating  the  quantities  that  could  be  imported  and
exported, and a single-channel market.

This completely post-1930s Depression type of system ruled the  scene  until
the Marketing of Agricultural Products Act of 1996  was  introduced  by  the
present  Government.  This  Act  completely  changed  the  profile  of   the
marketing of agricultural products by  doing  away  with  elaborate  control
measures and by introducing a free-market system. It worked  very  well.  It
was a very tough environment for the commercial farming community, but  they
showed their mettle and weathered the storm.  Some  are  doing  excellently.
Exports are growing and we are not doing badly at all.

The new Act put in place transitional  measures  to  allow  for  the  smooth
changeover  from  a  completely  controlled  environment  to  a  free-market
system. Parliamentary committees played a significant role  in  the  process
of 1996. Executive involvement was  provided  for  parliamentary  committees
with the levy system and the establishment  of  the  Agricultural  Marketing
Council, which guided the changeover to the  free-market  system.  The  idea
was to bring political representivity to the major transition taking  place.
That transition is completed.

A number of insignificant legal matters, like the recovery of money owed  to
the former boards, are still outstanding. That is about all  that  is  still
outstanding.

The constitutional environment has also  changed.  The  distinction  between
the functions of the legislature, judiciary and executive are becoming  more
prominent. I listened with interest to the motion  by  the  hon  Botha,  who
asked for accounting by the executive to Parliament. That  is  correct.  The
executive should not only be accountable to the  political  opposition,  but
also to its own party and the provinces.

The principal Act is being amended to provide for these  changes  and  other
technical  matters.  I  want  to  repeat  the  accounting   mechanisms   the
Constitution makes provision for. Section 55 of the Constitution  says  that
the National Assembly should provide  for  mechanisms  to  ensure  that  the
executive organs of state are accountable to the National Assembly.

Secondly, the Constitution says Parliament should  maintain  oversight  over
the executive's exercising of its powers. This includes  the  implementation
of  legislation.  In  other  words,  Parliament  needs  to  put   in   place
mechanisms, more than legislation, to control the executive and monitor  its
actions.

Other sections of the Constitution also refer to  it,  for  example  section
42,  which  says  the  National  Assembly,  as  a  national  forum,   should
scrutinise and oversee  the  actions  of  the  executive  and  that  Cabinet
members are collectively and individually accountable to a body such as  the
NCOP. This is where we want to hear the questions of the provinces.

A problem of crossed lines of accountability occurs when Parliament  or  its
committees  start  exercising  their  executive  functions.  It  means  that
Parliament is then accountable to itself. If Parliament appoints members  of
an executive body such as the Agricultural Marketing  Council  and  they  do
not perform well or cause problems, who is accountable? Who was  responsible
for appointing them? Parliament. That is the problem.

Judge Heath handled a well-known case, reported in 2001,  which  dealt  with
the matter of the division of the powers in the  state.  In  this  case  the
judge said: ``The Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa,  1996,
provides for a separation of powers between the executive,  the  legislature
and the judiciary.'' Laws inconsistent with that Constitution are invalid.

In this case the arguments were about the separation of powers  between  the
executive and the judiciary, but they were also valid for  the  division  of
powers between the executive and the legislature. This amending  Bill  tries
to correct this position.  It  proposes  that  parliamentary  committees  no
longer be involved  in  the  appointment  of  members  of  the  Agricultural
Marketing Council.

At present the Minister appoints its members  after  consultation  with  the
parliamentary committees, which makes it quite  an  extensive  process.  The
Minister is given two names of which she has to choose one. The role of  the
council is executive in nature, and there is no doubt about that.

The Bill also proposes that parliamentary committees no longer  be  involved
in the approval of statutory measures, including levies,  in  terms  of  the
Marketing of Agricultural Products  Act.  Regarding  the  representation  of
industries, the national Agricultural  Marketing  Council  usually  appoints
advisory committees to advise it on matters.

Knowledgeable people should be appointed to the advisory committees  of  the
council. If  they  are  compelled  to  only  appoint  people  from  directly
affected groups, we know exactly what such people would do. They  would  try
to protect their own industry and interests. They  would  not  look  at  the
broader marketing picture. We therefore try to appoint people  suitable  for
the task at hand, rather than using blanket requirements.

I want to refer to a few other major amendments in the Bill. I am  sure  hon
members will refer to this in their speeches. The Bill  aims  to  facilitate
the application of the Public Finance Management Act  regarding  the  fiscal
and auditing requirements for the National Agricultural Marketing Council.

The Public Finance Management Act necessitates these amendments,  which  are
consequential in nature. The Act also makes provision for  matters  standing
over from the old Marketing Act, like  the  utilisation  of  levies  imposed
under this Act. These are not the  same  levies  as  those  imposed  by  the
former control boards.

Provision is made for the transfer of funds to the trusts established  under
the new marketing  Act  to  promote  the  objectives  of  the  Marketing  of
Agricultural Products Act.

By the way, I am not always satisfied with the operation  of  our  different
trusts. We are now trying to amend  one  of  the  trust  deeds  which  makes
provision for, on the one hand, research out of the proceeds  of  the  trust
and, on the other, developmental work, like access to  marketing  to  assist
previously disadvantaged farmers. The Minister cannot  really  control  more
money going to development work. Some  of  the  trust  deeds,  I  must  say,
should be reviewed, but this is difficult. It is out of the control  of  the
Ministry now, because one must have consensus between the parties  when  one
amends a trust.
I also want to say that we must still think of where we are going  with  the
National Agricultural Marketing Council. The  present  amendments  which  we
are effecting are mostly technical. They are about the  appointment  of  the
members and the way levies are handled. Where are we really going  with  the
marketing council? On the one hand, it is important for us to  consider  the
relationship between the department and the National Agricultural  Marketing
Council. Our idea was that the NAMC  looked  at  the  internal  position  of
marketing  in  South  Africa.  We  have  a  very  powerful  section  in  the
department as well - looking  at  international  marketing  situations,  the
relationship with the WTO, international trade. How are we really  going  to
go forward in this matter? We finished this phase of transition.

I can  only  say  that  we  will  consult  extensively  with  the  portfolio
committees on the way  forward  with  the  National  Agricultural  Marketing
Council. Next year we must start developing a strategy on  this  matter  and
see where we must go.

The challenges in Africa and generally in South Africa,  in  particular,  in
the marketing of agricultural products are huge. There are huge  challenges.
Let me put it this way. One cannot succeed in the agriculture of  a  country
by just concentrating on production. One will go  nowhere.  One  must  first
work on marketing, and then one can go forward.

We sit with a terrible problem throughout Africa  and  in  South  Africa  as
well of large underdeveloped agricultural areas. Why are there  no  feedlots
in the traditional areas? If we want to use the American Africa  Growth  and
Opportunity Act, we can export a lot if we get our  vital  sanitary  matters
right. We can export  a  lot  of  meat  to  America.  But  we  do  not  have
productive areas in the traditional areas and it is possible to do this  and
to develop these areas. That is the type of marketing initiative we need.

I think we must build up the NAMC. We  must  look  again  at  where  we  are
going. We must look at the relationship with the  department  and  build  on
this so that it works for South  Africa.  We  have  finished  now  with  the
control systems, the breakdown of them and we have moved into a  free-market
system. Now we must really use this to work for South Africa.

There are also a few other matters in the Bill with which I will end.  I  am
sure that hon members of the select committee must be thanked for  the  work
they have done on this. I am very glad that we have come this far, but  this
is not the end of the  road  of  the  marketing  problem  in  South  Africa.
[Applause.]

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, hon Deputy  Minister,  members  of  this  House,
special delegates, the Marketing of  Agricultural  Products  Amendment  Bill
has been considered by all the nine provinces  and,  after  considering  it,
they all support this Bill.

This Bill is  essential  to  consolidating  the  Marketing  of  Agricultural
Products Act of 1996 by tightening the principles laid out in that Act,  and
assures us that the days  of  single-channel  marketing,  fixed  prices  and
control board domination are over.
The South African Government  has  intervened  extensively  in  agricultural
pricing and marketing in the past. This  exercising  of  statutory  controls
and allocation of subsidies has favoured powerful interests groups, such  as
certain  larger  commercial  farmers,  agricultural  processes  and  control
boards. The needs of low-income consumers and  small  farmers  in  the  then
Bantustans have  been  neglected,  whilst  employment  in  the  agricultural
sector turned to cheap labour and declined.

This Bill before us aims to bring the Act in line with the Constitution.  It
does this by streamlining the processes of appointment  of  members  to  the
National Agricultural Marketing  Council.  Formerly,  these  processes  were
dealt with by parliamentary committees, as the  Deputy  Minister  has  said.
This role of parliamentary committees caused problems in the  administration
of the Act as it confused the roles of the legislature  and  the  executive,
which roles are clearly distinguished  in  the  Constitution,  and  it  also
caused lengthy delays.

The amending of section  22  is  to  oblige  the  Minister  to  consult  the
National  Agricultural   Marketing   Council,   instead   of   parliamentary
committees, as already said. It will also ensure that the Minister  consults
the body that was created especially by the  Act  in  order  to  advise  the
Minister, that is the National Agricultural  Marketing  Council,  which  may
undertake investigations and advise the Minister regarding marketing  policy
and application, the co-ordination of agricultural  policy  in  relation  to
national  economic,  social  and  development  policies,  and  international
trends and developments.

The council that was established to advise the  Minister  is  consulted  and
the Minister is now subject to  oversight  by  Parliament,  as  intended  by
section 42(3) of  the  Constitution,  instead  of  parliamentary  committees
being placed in the position of being both player and referee, which is  the
case at present.

However, for  the  sake  of  streamlining  our  legislature  and  making  it
consistent with the spirit of  the  Constitution,  we  have  simplified  the
process  of  calling  for  nominations  for  appointment  to  the   National
Agricultural Marketing Council.  This  Bill  proposes  that  invitation  for
nomination be published in the  Gazette  and  departmental  newsletters,  as
well as in general media statements and by invitation to  the  parliamentary
committee.

The Minister shall also establish a selection committee,  and  appoint  such
candidates from  the  list  recommended  by  the  selection  committee.  The
Minister must within  30  days  after  making  any  appointment  inform  the
parliamentary committees in writing of the appointment made.

We need a total commitment to and maximum participation  of  the  population
in agricultural business, and not as a retirement or part-time  exercise  to
keep old people and  women  busy  while  men  are  working  in  the  cities.
Agriculture must be seen as  a  serious  business  for  all,  not  just  for
commercial farmers, but also for small-scale and subsistence farmers.

This  Bill  also  provides  for  consequential  amendments   following   the
promulgation of the Public Finance Management Act of  1999,  section  53  of
the Public Finance Management Act of 1999, and business  schedule  3  public
entities. The National Agricultural Marketing Council is listed  as  one  of
the schedule 3 public entities and this Bill brings the  Act  in  line  with
the Public Finance Management Act.

The Bill also provides for amendments to clarify the procedures  that  apply
in the case of levies, and clearly states the public nature of  and  control
over levies collected.  This  Bill  also  addresses  a  lacuna  in  the  Act
regarding the disposal of levies that  were  collected  under  the  repealed
Marketing Act of 1968.  It  does  this  by  validating  the  collection  and
utilisation of those levies before 28 February 1999.

In conclusion, it is my pleasure, therefore,  to  submit  the  Marketing  of
Agricultural Products Amendment Bill to the Council.  We  therefore  support
this Bill and the policy that underpins it. [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, we are fully aware of  the  fact  that  the
National  Agricultural  Marketing   Council   is   not   a   decision-making
institution and only recommends to the Minister, who has  those  powers.  We
are aware of the fact that the section 7 committees  may  be  instituted  by
the council to assist the council.

We are also aware of the problems of having the directly affected groups  as
mentioned by the Deputy Minister, included.  However,  we  want  to  caution
that although the council is not obliged to accommodate  them,  they  should
always be sensitive to the fact that it would be better to include them  and
have consensus with them, rather than leaving them out.

We  are  also  concerned  about  the  fact  that  Parliament,  through   its
committees, now has no specific role to play in the appointment  of  council
members. We urge the hon the Minister to embark  on  a  transparent  process
and to keep the standing and the select committees  of  Parliament  informed
throughout the process of appointing councillors.

We are in touch, especially in this Council, with  various  role-players  at
grass-roots level and can assist the  Minister  in  not  making  unnecessary
mistakes in the appointment of councillors. Agriculture  and  the  marketing
of its products, as mentioned by the Deputy Minister, are two vital  aspects
not only in the South African economy, but also as empowerment  instruments.
For these reasons,  the  Minister  must  have  access  to  the  best  advice
available, and we want to assist.

We agree with the division of powers, as set out  by  the  Deputy  Minister,
and we do not argue wanting to appoint the councillors, but just to be  able
to give inputs, which can be ignored by the Minister.  We  do  not  want  to
appoint councillors, and I do not think we ever did actually.

The Deputy Minister - I nearly said President and that  would  have  been  a
great mistake really - has also pointed out aspects about the levies.

Dit is baie belangrik dat die surplusheffings, wat na die trusts  toe  gaan,
miskien toegewys moet word aan di√© bedrywe wat die heffings betaal het.  Dit
moet nie net wyd aangewend word nie.

Die voerkrale waarna die adjunkminister verwys het, is  'n  baie  belangrike
aspek. Ons probleem in die Suid-Afrikaanse  landbou  is  juis  dat  daar  'n
klomp entrepreneurs is en talle produksieprojekte begin word.  Die  minister
het ook di√© probleem uitgewys.

Ons moet mark- en nie tegnologie- of produkgedrewe wees nie.  Voerkrale  het
'n wonderlike byvoordeel. Velle en huide se gehalte  sal  onmiddellik  styg.
Op sy beurt sal dit weer 'n bykomende bedryf in Suid-Afrika kan stimuleer.

Ons moet egter eers markte kry en die mense wat projekte aanbeveel  en  geld
vir landbouprojekte insamel, bewus  maak  daarvan  dat  dit  markgerig  moet
wees. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It is very important that the surplus  levies,  which  go  to  the  trusts,
should perhaps be awarded to those industries that  paid  the  levies.  They
should not simply be applied broadly.

The feedlots to which the Deputy Minister  referred  are  a  very  important
aspect. Our problem in South African agriculture  is  that  there  are  many
entrepreneurs and many production projects are started.  The  Minister  also
alluded to this problem.

We have to be market-driven and not technology or  product-driven.  Feedlots
have a wonderful spin-off. The quality of skins and hides  will  immediately
improve. This, in turn,  can  stimulate  an  additional  industry  in  South
Africa.

However, first we must have the  markets,  and  the  people  that  recommend
projects and collect money for agricultural projects must be made  aware  of
the fact that this has to be market-oriented. [Applause.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! The special delegate from  KwaZulu-Natal
is not here so we shall proceed to Ms Rossouw of the Western Cape.

Ms A ROSSOUW (Western Cape): Chairperson, Deputy  Minister,  Prof  Du  Toit,
South African agriculture is currently  in  an  enviable  position  in  that
certain sections of the sector  share  many  of  the  characteristics  of  a
developing economy, while the commercial farming sector shares many  of  the
features of a developed economy and is also changing in the same way.

It follows that decision-makers can either chart a traditional  agricultural
development route, or  they  can  develop  a  strategy  that  will  catapult
domestic agriculture into the information society. This  is  because  it  is
tensioned between industrialised and nonindustrialised farm products,  which
is a characteristic of information  society  agriculture.  Such  a  strategy
should,  inter  alia,  make   provision   for   meeting   the   demand   for
nonindustrialised farm produce through the  development  and  implementation
of an internationally recognised enabling  framework  for  terra-based  farm
products. Part of this leg should comprise research on defining  terra-based
products, agritourism  and  demand  and  supply  of  nonindustrialised  farm
produce.

South  Africa's  developing  agriculture,  especially  with  its  wealth  of
traditional knowledge, may benefit. There should  be  understanding  of  the
dynamics and social costs and benefits of supply chains in order to  develop
appropriate support services  like  research,  extension  and  training  for
farmers, especially family farmers.

There should also be special support  measures  for  marginalised  commodity
farmers caught outside supply chains or in nonindustrialised agriculture.  A
reconsideration of policy frameworks should be  undertaken  to  ensure  that
the policies are appropriate for environments where local and  international
trade will more and more be within the vertically integrated  chains  rather
than  between  organisations.  Issues  should  include  trade,  intellectual
property rights, and especially publicly  funded  research  results,  farmer
support and farmer support services.

Teen di√© agtergrond ondersteun die Wes-Kaapse regering die wetsontwerp.  Dit
kan op  die  lang  termyn  bydra  om  die  werksaamhede  van  die  nasionale
landboubemarkingsraad te stroomlyn. Die  wetsontwerp  maak  voorsiening  vir
die nuwe prosedures.

Ek wil my skaar by diegene  wat  bekommerd  is  oor  die  feit  dat  staande
komitees op  landbou  in  die  toekoms  nie  meer  by  die  aanstelling  van
raadslede betrokke sal wees nie. Uit eie ervaring, ook in die Wes-Kaap,  was
dit 'n proses  wat  elke  parlementslid,  ongeag  politieke  party,  tevrede
gestel het oor die gehalte van benoemdes. Dit bly steeds  die  reg  van  die
minister om uiteindelik die aanstelling te maak.

Steeds in belang  van  landbou,  bly  ons  by  ons  standpunt  dat  ons  die
wetsontwerp ondersteun omdat dit sal bydra tot die bevordering  van  landbou
in Suid-Afrika. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Against this background the Western Cape government supports this Bill.  In
the long term this can contribute to  streamlining  the  activities  of  the
National Agricultural Marketing Council. This  Bill  provides  for  the  new
procedures.

I would like to associate myself with those  who  are  concerned  about  the
fact that the standing committees on  agriculture  will  in  future  not  be
involved  with  the  appointment  of  councillors.  Speaking  from  my   own
experience, also in the Western Cape, this  was  a  process  that  satisfied
every member of Parliament,  irrespective  of  political  party,  about  the
quality of the nominees. It is still the right of the Minister to  make  the
appointment in the end.

Still in the interests of agriculture, we stand by  our  viewpoint  that  we
support  this  Bill  because  it  will  contribute  to  the   promotion   of
agriculture in South Africa. [Applause.]]
Mev A M VERSFELD: Voorsitter,  die  totstandkoming  van  'n  vrye  mark  vir
landbouprodukte is deel van die proses van die  ontwikkeling  en  groei  van
die Suid-Afrikaanse landboubedryf.

Dit het tot so 'n mate ontwikkel dat Suid-Afrika een van die min  lande  ter
w√™reld   is   wat,   sonder   staatsubsidies,   'n   netto-uitvoerder    van
landbouprodukte is. Hy ding op internasionale markte  mee  en  dit  het  tot
gevolg  gehad   dat   staatsbetrokkenheid   in   die   bemarking   van   die
landbouprodukte afgeskaal het tot die punt dat  statut√™re  ingrepe  drasties
afgeskaal en uitgefaseer word.

Die vrye mark  vir  landbouprodukte  in  Suid-Afrika  het  vele  gevolge  en
implikasies wat nie altyd besef word nie. Eerstens reageer die vrye mark  op
vraag en aanbod en wanbalanse in die mark kan  lei  tot  groot  ontwrigting,
veral vir die kleiner boer wat nie altyd die wisseling van pryse  finansieel
kan hanteer nie.

Die tweede kenmerk is die wisseling van pryse in antwoord op  die  vraag-en-
aanbodbalans. Ho√´ pryse  vir  landbouprodukte  is  altyd  gekoppel  aan  ho√´
risiko's. Die regering moet van sy kant af toesien  dat  vestigingsprogramme
aan die volhoubaarheidsbeginsel voldoen.

Die grootste probleem wat landbou binne die heersende vrye  bemarkingsbeleid
in Suid-Afrika ervaar, is dat die boer uitgelewer word aan die  wispelturige
mark en die natuur. Soos die agb  adjunkminister  weet,  bied  die  owerheid
baie beperkte hulpmaatre√´ls. Ek meen daar is slegs een vir veeboere.

Ek wil graag 'n voorstel op die tafel sit om die landbouer by te  staan.  In
goeie jare kan 'n gedeelte van sy inkomste belastingvry opsy gesit  word  om
vir maerder jare te vergoed.

Die vrye mark bepaal dat daar so min as moontlik van regeringskant  ingemeng
moet word. Waar die regering wel betrokke is, moet dit op  deursigtige  wyse
geskied. Na my mening gee die wetgewing een persoon, die  minister,  al  die
mag in die hand. As dit egter sal help om die beleid vinnig  deur  te  voer,
ondersteun die  DP  die  wetgewing.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, the  establishment  of  a  free  market  for
agricultural products is part of the process of the development  and  growth
of the South African agricultural industry.

It has developed to such an extend that South  Africa  is  one  of  the  few
countries in the world which, without state subsidies, is a net exporter  of
agricultural products. South Africa competes in  international  markets  and
this has led to state involvement in the marketing of agricultural  products
being scaled down to the  point  where  statutory  interventions  are  being
drastically scaled down and phased out.

The  free  market  for  agricultural  products  in  South  Africa  has  many
consequences and implications which are not always  realised.  Firstly,  the
free market responds to supply and demand and imbalances in the  market  can
lead to great  disruption,  particularly  for  smaller  farmers  who  cannot
always deal financially with the fluctuation of prices.

The second characteristic is the fluctuation of prices in  response  to  the
supply-and-demand balance. High prices for agricultural products are  always
linked to high risks. For its part, the  Government  must  see  to  it  that
start-up programmes comply with the principle of sustainability.

The biggest problem experienced by agriculture within the  prevailing  free-
market policy in South Africa, is that the farmer is at  the  mercy  of  the
fickle market and of nature. As the  hon  the  Deputy  Minister  knows,  the
Government offers restricted aid measures. I think there  is  only  one  for
cattle farmers.

I would like to place on the table a proposal to assist the farmer. In  good
years a portion of his revenue can be set  aside,  tax-free,  to  compensate
for leaner years.

The free market  determines  that  there  should  be  as  little  government
intervention as possible. Where the government is involved, this  must  take
place in a transparent manner. In my  opinion,  the  legislation  gives  one
person, the Minister, all the power. However, if it would help to  have  the
policy adopted quickly, the DP supports the legislation. [Applause.]]

Mr P NKAYI (Eastern  Cape):  Chairperson,  we  support  this  amendment.  We
believe this demonstrates  very  clearly  the  maturity  of  our  democracy,
firstly because we imagine it should not be easy for people  who  are  given
the privilege of power to take a step to legislate themselves out  of  their
power, which is what this committee has done.

I think the Bill talks sufficiently about representivity  in  terms  of  the
marketing of agricultural products, as well as financial accountability.  We
think that the Bill addresses this sufficiently.

We think it makes both political and economical sense  for  legislatures  to
take into account all of these points when they enter, especially given  the
nature of the global situation, into relations with  other  economic  actors
of the world.

Mr P I MALEFANE (Gauteng): Chairperson, hon  Deputy  Minister  and  members,
one man was asked to deliver a speech and was given the  topic  of  sex.  He
took the stand and said the following: ``Ladies and gentlemen, I  greet  you
all.  It  gives  me  great  pleasure.  I  thank  you.''  And  he  sat  down.
[Laughter.] That was the shortest speech I ever  heard  in  my  life.  I  am
tempted to follow in those particular footsteps.

As Gauteng we do not have much to say  on  the  proposed  amendments,  given
that the issues that were raised during our public hearings were  adequately
addressed. We are also encouraged to know that  the  Bill  seeks  to  ensure
that moneys collected as levies will be  used  in  a  manner  that  promotes
agricultural products and assists in the development of the industry.
We are confident  that  those  that  have  been  on  the  periphery  of  the
mainstream of agriculture will now  have  an  opportunity  of  tapping  into
those resources to promote their  agricultural  produce.  It  is  with  this
understanding that we do not hesitate  to  support  the  Bill  and  vote  in
favour of it. [Applause.]

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister, our guests and all our  hon
members, we are debating the Marketing of  Agricultural  Products  Amendment
Bill, which is largely of a technical nature. We know  full  well  that  the
majority of our people still do not own much of the land,  yet  they  labour
for much of its products with very little return for their labour.

Even after many years of life spent farming for subsistence, quite a few  of
them are then evicted from these farms. Some do not get to bury their  loved
ones or even visit them. It is also hurtful to  see  where  the  farmworkers
live as human  beings,  whereas  farm  owners  would  not  house  their  own
children like that.
Many farmers do not make much profit on the land  because  of  unpredictable
seasonal rains on overused soil that is so ill-nourished that has it  to  be
revitalised with chemicals in order to produce.

Farmers have gone bankrupt through drought and the flooding of markets  with
substandard products from overseas, where they are subsidised by  their  own
governments. It is time we boosted our ``Buy South  African''  campaign.  We
need to act now. The ANC-led Government of South Africa was concerned  about
the situation, and that is why  it  passed  the  Marketing  of  Agricultural
Products  Act  in  1996.  Now  there  is  a  potential  for  steady  growth,
production  and  marketing  of  products  for  all  who  choose  to  make  a
meaningful contribution to our beloved motherland.

The Bill proposes to amend the Act to allow new  procedures  for  collecting
levies which are currently in a trust fund that helps  some  farmers.  These
farmers will now be freed to be used to train in  subsidised  projects  that
boost agriculture and its products in our country.  This  will  also  enable
more South Africans to utilise their God-given  time,  talents  and  energy,
locally and abroad.

The  Minister  now  has  direct  communication  and  works  with  provincial
departments of agriculture and is free to appoint whoever  may  be  suitable
to ensure that the spirit and vision of the Acts are realised and  put  into
practice.

The Bill hopes to limit opportunities for corruption  and  the  embezzlement
of levies and funds by providing guidelines  for  their  administration.  It
also desires to alter certain procedures irrespective of financial  matters,
so that it may be in agreement with the Public  Finance  Management  Act  of
1999. It will also enable the Minister  to  dissolve  the  old  boards  that
operate under the Marketing Act of 1968, which has now been repealed.  These
old  boards  did  not  include  farm  owners  and  farmworkers,   who   were
marginalised by race and colour. Many farmworkers did not know of this  Act,
but produced agricultural products, and they were also used to  market  them
as unskilled labourers.

In the pursuit of justice, the  Bill  will  show  how  the  levies  will  be
collected and used and records kept. It states specifically that  no  levies
shall  form  part  of  any  person's  assets,  even  if  also  a   body   or
organisation. It demands that all levies used  and  those  that  may  remain
must be accounted for in a way that  is  determined  for  their  safety  and
efficiency. This too must satisfy the Auditor-General, who  will  audit  the
records annually. It is this Bill that will strengthen the  control,  import
and export of agricultural products in order to maintain high  standards  of
health, safety,  production,  packaging  and  efficiency.  It  empowers  the
Minister and the provincial departments to stop, demand and  allow  products
that do not comply with standards that are required.

It is therefore important that the Department  of  Agriculture  be  given  a
better budget so that more of our young people can be  trained  to  discover
the wide choices of  growth,  development  and  job  satisfaction  that  are
available in the field of agriculture. Agriculture is the  lifeline  of  all
nations.
Our young people can train in order to open, operate  and  maintain  markets
overseas and throughout the continent. For this a great future  has  already
come.  The  field  is  wide  open.  Personnel  are   needed,   for   without
agriculture, no person, bird or animal can survive, no  business  can  exist
and our health and economic future will be doomed. We will be cursed by  our
future generations. We therefore support this amending Bill.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  I  must
thank the members for the debate and  quite  interesting  observations  that
have been made.

I always enjoy listening to the Rev Chabaku. There is  something  optimistic
about her, and she can make any subject interesting. I think she  should  go
into marketing. From the Free State, we are born marketers,  I  always  find
that her speeches are very optimistic.

I would like to thank the hon Malefane, who gave  a  very  sexy  speech,  as
well as the hon Nkayi. Mrs Versfeld talked like a  real  farmer.  She  is  a
farmer, and that is why she is complaining about  weather  and  the  market.
Those are two basic things.

'n Mens is oorgelewer aan die mark en oorgelewer aan die weer. Die  agb  lid
het my innige simpatie. [One is at the mercy of the market and at the  mercy
of the weather. The hon member has my heartfelt sympathy.]

But what  she  is  actually  bringing  to  the  fore  is  that  modern  risk
management practices are integral to successful farming. Risk management  is
actually a very difficult science, and we have  very  few  people  in  South
Africa  who  are  really  good  at  risk  management.  It  is   actually   a
mathematical science.

I agree. The market is quite fickle, as is the  weather.  But  that  is  the
challenge of farming. We have a problem, worldwide, of declining  prices  of
products while the inputs are always going up. But  we  have  seen  how  our
farmers cope with it. For example, we have seen it with the rise  in  diesel
prices. The farmers started to be more  efficient  in  using  their  diesel.
They used it in a way in which they could cope with rising  prices.  I  know
that it is still a problem, and it will remain a problem.  But  it  is  also
true that if you give a challenge to a farmer, whether  he  is  an  emerging
farmer, a small farmer, a big farmer or a medium farmer, I have always  seen
farmers being able to rise to the occasion. There are a tough  lot,  farmers
are, and they can do it. I admire them tremendously.

I thank Mrs Versfeld. We do not have  a  lot  of  power  in  the  Minister's
hands. That is not what it is about at all. I  know  of  one  thing,  namely
that there is nothing like power  in  the  Minister's  hand  in  agriculture
because one will most probably be wrong. Agriculture is  so  difficult,  and
marketing is so difficult. If one thinks  that  one  can  control  that,  it
springs out on the other side and it just gives one  the  opposite  results.
One cannot move without good advice. That is the secret  of  the  game.  The
Ministry must stay close to the different  sectors  in  agriculture  because
they really know what the game is about.

I thank the hon Ms Rossouw for a very well-researched address.  I  was  most
impressed by the knowledge available in the Western Cape about  agriculture.
I thank her for the information.

I can tell Mrs Van Niekerk that we will remain  sensitive  to  all  sectors.
That is the way in which one has to drive this process because  in  the  end
the Government cannot market and  farm.  It  is  a  bad  farmer  and  a  bad
marketer. This is for civil society and its sectors to do their own job.  We
must create the frameworks. We must assist in creating the  support  systems
apart from subsidising. That is not what I am talking about, but  rather  to
create the regulating frameworks, and we will talk more  about  it  when  we
come to animal health just now. That is the  way  to  have  the  systems  to
support it.

Indeed, we must be transparent in the appointments. But what we need  is  an
NAMC  that  can  really  build  and  help  us  to  build  the  marketing  of
agricultural products in  South  Africa.  We  must  succeed.  We  are  quite
successful as farmers in South Africa at the moment. The sector as  a  whole
changes South Africa. But we can always do better and we need an NAMC  which
can help us. We must get the best advice available to do the right things.

I thank the members for this opportunity and the support. [Applause.]

Debate concluded

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             ANIMAL HEALTH BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  the
Animal Health Bill before the Council is actually very important for us.

This is typical of the type  of  thing  which  we  also  talked  about  when
considering the previous Bill. What is the role  of  Government?  Government
must create the frameworks and systems for the industry to produce.

Another thing about this Bill is  that  it  creates  a  co-operative  system
which we think it is an example of how national and  provincial  governments
must work together. We have a formula that we also  developed  in  the  Meat
Safety Bill, and basically we have the same pattern  in  the  Animal  Health
Bill.

The problem is basically this: Animal health and food safety  are  the  same
thing. When one looks at the international position one sees that  the  only
way that one can get acknowledgement  for  food  safety  and  animal  health
internationally, when one exports or imports, is by meeting the  requirement
that the national government must certify. There is  no  way  that  one  can
export meat from Germany and get the government of Bavaria  to  certify  the
meat as safe. The international agreements work  in  such  a  way  that  the
national government must certify. That is the first consideration.

The  second  consideration  is  this.  Animal  diseases   do   not   operate
provincially. Foot-and-mouth viruses and anthrax bacteria do not know  where
the border is between the Free State and the Northern Cape. When we had  the
anthrax problem in the Northern the Cape last year, just near Kimberley,  it
was typical: It came from the game and got  into  the  cattle.  People  were
infected by the cattle, and we  had  deaths  there  amongst  the  Batlhaping
people.

But when I came there, I was in the district of Boshoff, next  door  in  the
Free State, and I found out that they thought that this  thing  was  in  the
Northern Cape, while in fact one of the farms,  which  extended  across  the
border between the Northern Cape and Free State, had a bit of a  problem  as
well. These diseases do not know  provincial  borders.  That  was  also  the
basic problem with the control  of  foot-and-mouth  disease  in  Europe  and
Britain now recently. It was affected by the  movement  of  people  and  the
movement of cattle, the movement of meat and the movement of products.

It is a national thing when we have a problem. It breaks out at  any  place.
So what must we create? In  the  provinces  the  veterinarians  are  on  the
ground, so we must  create  a  system  of  intensive  co-operation  and  co-
ordination between the national level and  the  provincial  level.  In  this
Bill I think we have put down a system which is practical and which  I  hope
we can make work very well with the co-operation of the provinces, and  that
is also the intention of our administration.

It works in this way. A national executive officer is appointed at  national
level and there is provision for the assignment of certain duties  and  also
of delegation  to  MECs  and,  through  MECs,  to  other  officials  to  the
provinces. The system will be just as good  as  it  is  organised.  It  will
depend on provinces putting the funds aside to make it work really well.

We have to do this because when there is an animal disease crisis, it  is  a
big crisis; it is almost a war situation. If only the House  had  seen  what
we had to do in Kwazulu-Natal when we had  the  outbreak  of  foot-and-mouth
disease: One needs the army to provide manpower  and  womanpower,  to  close
the roads, to stand guard, to clean people's feet  and  to  clean  the  cars
with antiseptic.

The chief executive officer must have the powers of a general, as in  a  war
situation, to be able to close farms, to do this and that, to remove  cattle
or pigs, to move things and to close roads. In fact,  the  powers  given  in
this Bill are almost like powers in a war situation. It is the only way.

If one has a loose type of approach towards this type of  disease,  one  can
destroy whole sectors of the economy. The farmers  in  Britain  are  ruined.
The tourist industry has taken a dip that one cannot believe. So this  is  a
serious matter. Of course it is the accountability here that  makes  a  body
like the NCOP, to my mind, so important. If we have a problem in  Mpumalanga
on the border of the Kruger Park, then our NCOP must bring it here  so  that
we can talk about these matters. That is the way that we must go.

The House will see that in this Bill there are  now  very  good  powers  for
fencing. We need these. We have a problem with the  fence  between  Zimbabwe
and South Africa, which used to be a military fence, but now is mostly  used
for animal disease purposes. It has to be maintained and we need powers  for
our officials to put a fence where there is a need for it.

I must thank the provinces, the legislatures and the  committees,  including
the select committees here, for doing the  work  on  this  very  complicated
Bill, but this Bill must change the position which we had previously. It  is
actually a constitutional requirement that we amend this Bill.

Globalisation is enforcing this approach, and only if we have  phytosanitary
and sanitary systems in place can we hope to  expand  our  exports.  At  the
moment exports in meat are steadily rising, but we do have problems. We  had
a problem with consignments to Saudi Arabia, for example,  to  which,  based
on completely wrong information, we were banned from exporting.  These  were
big consignments. The assumption was that  the  foot-and-mouth  disease  was
still affecting the position, while it was not. People just  read  something
on the Internet and proposed a ban.

I am not saying that that is how this matter is  being  handled  in  detail,
but the point is this: We cannot succeed in building exports without  having
an excellent system  of  veterinary  controls  in  place.  The  single  most
important reason for failing is not having that in place. We  must  succeed.
I admit it is difficult. It is complicated these days,  with  different  new
techniques in farming and animal husbandry which make it more difficult.  If
one runs a feedlot, for example, it is basically  a  sanitation  works  that
one is running, so one's hygienic controls must be excellent.  That  is  the
priority when one runs such an operation.

Let me just say another thing about economic  growth  in  Africa,  in  South
Africa, in the deprived areas of South Africa. The place  to  give  a  kick-
start to economic development is animal husbandry. There is a huge trend  of
animal  production  moving  from  the  developed  world  to  the  developing
countries, because we  have  a  competitive  edge,  naturally,  without  the
financial support of government. We can do it, and it is happening all  over
the world. In the Far East there is a huge  revolution,  almost,  in  animal
production. It is happening in parts of the north of Africa.  South  of  the
Sahara  it  is  not  really  happening,  except  in  South  Africa's  highly
commercialised sectors, but the place to start  growth  in  the  traditional
areas in South Africa is by animal production.

We have people there who know how  to  work  with  animals,  but  they  need
support and incentives to be able to put up the production. A large part  of
making it succeed in the traditional areas is  animal  disease  control.  We
can put up the productivity of cattle, goats and  sheep  hugely,  almost  to
revolutionary levels, just by giving some veterinary attention  there,  just
by getting the systems working. When the animal  production  goes  up,  then
there is surplus production.  We  cannot  accept  that  we  must  stay  with
subsistence agriculture in those areas forever and throughout Africa.  Those
areas can attain levels of productivity and can  start  to  add  value,  but
then the infrastructure must be put in place,  and  that  infrastructure  is
this Bill.

The first is ensuring animal disease control and  the  second  is  preparing
roads there and so on, but this is the start. Animal production is  the  way
to kick-start economic life there. We have  seen  that,  for  example,  with
sheep, with the shed systems, just learning how to cut wool  in  some  parts
of the Eastern Cape can mean that the income in that small region, almost  a
small district, can multiply eight or nine times in one year just  from  the
income of wool and good sheep husbandry. This is the way to go.

I am sorry, I have been talking about the politics of  this  matter,  and  I
hope the reverend will tell us more about the Bill. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister,  hon  members,  I  am  also
tempted to talk as the hon the Deputy  Minister  was  talking,  and  not  to
speak about what the Bill says. There was a  concern  from  other  provinces
that the consultation was not according to expectations.  There  were  those
who said that traditional  leaders  had  not  been  consulted  as  had  been
expected.

We feel this Bill challenges the entire country. We should work together  as
white blood cells where this disease is taking hold. We should be  ready  to
address these situations, otherwise great numbers of animals  will  have  to
be killed and burnt. That is a direct attack on our economy, etc.

Information should therefore not remain with commercial farmers, but  should
reach subsistence, emerging farmers - in fact, all members of society.

The Bill before us is one of the most important pieces of legislation to  be
passed by our Government to help us  regulate  and  control  the  health  of
animals, animal products and by-products. One of  the  biggest  problems  of
livestock farmers in South Africa and the SADC region is  the  large  number
of animal diseases on our continent. It is  only  through  effective  animal
disease control and utilisation of updated remedies that we will be able  to
prevent a small outbreak from becoming an epidemic.

The whole nation was sensitised to the importance of having the  appropriate
legislative framework firmly in place to assist provinces in particular  and
the nation in general, especially  during  natural  disasters  such  as  the
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. For those who still do  not  know,  this
disease is an acute, highly contagious viral infection of domestic and  wild
cloven-hoofed animals, often resulting in an extremely high mortality  rate,
especially in young animals.

I am sure most  of  us  have  very  clear  memories  of  the  foot-and-mouth
epidemic that started in mid-September last year in KwaZulu-Natal. Those  of
us who are not farmers heard about the disease for the first  time.  Only  a
few weeks before, some had seen the reports of  the  outbreak  of  foot-and-
mouth disease in the United Kingdom. At that time we  heard  that  the  last
time South Africa had experienced anything similar  to  the  proportions  of
the  unfolding  disease  was  in  1956,  when  3¬†000  head  of  cattle  were
destroyed. Little did we know that our own crisis would rear almost  out  of
control.

As new outbreaks were discovered across the length and breadth  of  KwaZulu-
Natal, both South Africans and the  international  community  realised  that
the increasing incidents reported far exceeded what had  happened  in  1956.
``A national crisis'' was how the DG, Bongiwe Njobe, described the events.

We watched as the national Department  of  Agriculture  and  all  the  role-
players in KwaZulu-Natal started the  drastic  measures  needed  to  control
this  disease.  From  the  initial  reports  from  KwaZulu-Natal   and   the
surrounding area, it spread to almost the entire KwaZulu-Natal. The  disease
control units of the provincial and national governments and  their  support
structures placed KwaZulu-Natal under strict  quarantine.  Some  areas  were
entirely shut  off  with  road  blocks.  Workers  armed  with  disinfectants
guarded the comings and goings of people and animals into  and  out  of  the
area.

The Agricultural Research Council  also  offered  their  assistance  through
clinical   and   epidemiological   investigations,   laboratory    services,
investigations of suspected cases and checking of the infectivity status  of
animals throughout the country through serological surveillance.

Thousands of cloven-hoofed  animals  in  the  surrounding  area  that  could
potentially become infected were inoculated. As  the  disease  continued  to
spread, the international community  began  imposing  partial  and  complete
bans of South African meats and products. Eventually thousands of  heads  of
cattle were not only killed, but  their  carcasses  burned  to  destroy  the
infection completely.

It was clear that a new risk management system was needed. It had to be  one
that would outline norms and standards necessary  for  the  containment  and
monitoring of animal diseases in line with both national  and  international
standards. This new risk management system needed to  anticipate  challenges
and to respond effectively and efficiently to disease disasters.  This  risk
management system also needed to take cognisance of the  fact  that  disease
knows no boundary. [Applause.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson,  the  fact  that  this  Act  was  drafted  in
consultation with provinces through the ITCA working groups,  the  ITC  head
of department and Minmec, and that this Bill was also drafted  in  order  to
bring animal health legislation in  line  with  our  Constitution,  is  very
reassuring.

Measures to prevent and  control  the  occurrence  of  animal  diseases  are
according to international norms and  standards.  The  Office  International
des  Epizooties,  or  OIE  is  an  international  organisation  which  gives
guidance on  all  animal  health  issues.  The  organisation  draws  minimum
standards, guidelines and procedures  for  the  control  and  prevention  of
animal diseases. It also guides countries on the measures which need  to  be
followed when trading with one another.
The OIE  serves  as  the  standard  formulating  body  to  the  World  Trade
Organisation which deals with  trade.  The  fact  that  these  international
standards serve as guidelines for animal health in the country is also  very
reassuring.

Animal health is a  concurrent  function  between  national  and  provincial
government. The responsibility of the national  Departments  of  Agriculture
and Land Affairs is to ensure that policy formulation, norms  and  standards
are maintained, while provinces implement the policy.

The MEC must designate an officer who is a veterinarian to the  province  as
the provincial executive officer. This officer may  delegate  any  power  or
duty to any officer under his  or  her  control.  The  provincial  executive
officer should, on a regular basis, provide the national  executive  officer
with reports of the functions monitored under the Act. The NEO  may  require
in writing certain information from the PEO or  any  other  person  for  the
purpose of monitoring.

I regard the section on the restriction on exportation  as  very  important.
This section is new and does not exist under the current  Act.  The  purpose
of introducing this section is to ensure health guarantees for  all  animals
and animal products exported under this Bill.

This is to maintain the integrity of the country  and  to  ensure  that  all
animals and animal products exported from  South  Africa  do  not  pose  any
health risk to the importing  country.  South  African  veterinary  services
have been challenged before where animals or animal  products  of  a  lesser
health status were exported.

Importing countries set requirements for  the  importation  of  animals  and
animal products. There are countries where there are no conditions  for  the
importation of animals and animal  products.  In  such  situations,  when  a
problem arises, it is not an individual who will be blamed for the  outbreak
of diseases, but South Africa. This affects  the  South  African  market  in
animals and animal products, and no one will trust South African products.
I think this is extremely important. I would like to  refer  to  the  Deputy
Minister, who said that we should have an  excellent  system  of  veterinary
services in this country. I absolutely agree with him.

Earlier this year, in the Budget Vote, I asked the  Minister  why  they  had
cut down on agricultural research, especially at Onderstepoort. We know  for
a fact that Onderstepoort is losing its best doctors and researchers.  Where
do they go? Not overseas. They go to countries like Kenya,  because  of  the
conditions they work under.

Die omstandighede waarin hulle werk, is baie beter as di√© in Suid-Afrika.

Di√© wetgewing is absoluut noodsaaklik, maar dit kan nie alleen staan  sonder
die nodige navorsing nie. As ons navorsing se  geld  afskaal  tot  die  vlak
waarop dit nou is, kan ek nie sien hoe di√© wet enigsins vir ons  van  waarde
gaan wees wat siektes  betref  nie.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)
[The conditions they work under are much better than those in South Africa.

This legislation is absolutely essential, but it cannot stand alone  without
the necessary research. If we are scaling down funding for research  to  its
current level, I fail to see how this Act is going to be of any value to  us
in respect of diseases. [Applause.]]

Ms A ROSSOUW (Western Cape): Madam Chair, hon Deputy Minister, in  principle
the Western Cape supports the  proposed  Bill.  However,  I  would  like  to
comment on certain clauses of this Bill. In terms of clause  4,  designation
of assignees can be done only by the national Minister for  Agriculture  and
Land Affairs, and this could be challenged in terms of section  35(2)(b)  of
the constitution of the Western Cape, in that  it  does  not  allow  a  free
choice to the province to decide who would be allowed to render a service.

This clause was copied in total  from  the  Agricultural  Product  Standards
Act, and also incorporated  into  the  Meat  Safety  Act.  The  Agricultural
Product  Standards  Act  is,  however,  the  sole  function  and   executive
responsibility  of  the  national  Department  of  Agriculture,  while   the
proposed Animal Health Bill  defines  a  concurrent  responsibility  between
provinces and the national authority.

The province should  therefore  have  the  right  to  appoint  assignees  to
deliver services within the province if the need arises, and should  not  be
subject to the  appointment  thereof  by  the  national  Minister.  Although
clause  11,  which  addresses  the  control  over  quarantine  stations,  is
assigned to the provincial authority in clause 5, assurances must  be  given
that a province, as the first line of defence against  the  introduction  of
disease, would have the prerogative to defend its own interest in  terms  of
imported  animals  or  animal  products  via  its  control  over  quarantine
stations.

The ideal would be that the province takes control over quarantine  stations
as an assigned function,  and  that  the  service  rendered  be  ordered  or
monitored by the national department. Clause 8(5)(a)  prohibits  the  export
of animals or animal products, and is not assigned to provinces in terms  of
clause 5 of the Bill.

However, the provincial veterinary authority is  in  the  best  position  to
determine the risk for the importing country, and should have the  authority
to refuse the export of an animal or animal products, if it poses a risk  to
the importing country. This subclause is also  not  compatible  with  clause
8(1) in terms of which the provincial authority can certify the export of  a
product, but not refuse exports in terms of subclause 8(5)(a).

Clause 16 - the animal health schemes - is assigned to  provinces  in  terms
of clause 5, but it should be made clear if a province can initiate its  own
animal health  scheme  disease  surveillance  programmes  with  the  aim  of
establishing sanitary guarantees and  export  facilitation,  for  example  a
scheme with the aim of zoning  a  province  free  of  a  particular  disease
required as a prerequisite for export certification.
The Bill gives national and provincial governments concurrent  functions  in
which the majority of  the  functions  of  the  Bill  are  assigned  to  the
province. The Bill retains  basic  principles  of  animal  disease  control,
which is in accordance with international norms and standards.  It  provides
for facilities such as the establishment of quarantine stations  and  animal
health  schemes,  and  also  describes  the  duties,  responsibilities   and
obligations of animal owners.

The new provisions of the Bill  provide  for  the  assignment  of  executive
authorities to  provinces  and  the  assignment  of  certain  functions  and
administration  by  the  national  Minister  to  nongovernmental  parastatal
organisations or legal persons,  as  well  as  the  suspension  of  assigned
executive functions by the national Minister.

The  Bill  assigns  to  provinces  functions,  and  will  enable  provincial
authorities to control animal diseases and, as such, we support the Bill  in
principle. [Applause.]

Mr M M MAMASE (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, the Animal  Health  Bill  repeals
the Animal Diseases Act, Act 35 of 1994.  This  Act  is  being  repealed  in
order to bring animal health legislation in  line  with  our  constitutional
provisions as well as to accommodate new developments and  changes  in  both
the local and international livestock industries.

This Bill is different from the previous Act in that it puts  more  emphasis
on animal health than on animal disease. This mindset  shift  has  refocused
the attention of Government on prevention of  disease,  and  away  from  the
curative approach. There are certain general guiding principles  that  apply
in respect of all legislation in terms of Schedule 4  of  the  Constitution.
This matter has been dealt with by the speaker behind me, so I am not  going
to deal with it.

The Animal Health Bill seeks to  regulate  veterinary  services  within  the
Republic of South Africa. Animal production is one  of  the  most  important
agricultural activities in this country in general, and in our  province  in
particular, which is heavily dependent on animal  health  to  yield  optimal
production.  Food  security  and  primary  animal  health  care  are   major
priorities at both national and provincial level. The aim is to improve  the
quality of life of the people of this country.

The Bill has, as one of its objects,  the  promotion  of  the  wellbeing  of
South Africans by ensuring an adequate supply of safe  animal  products  and
by eliminating exposure  to  zoonotic  diseases.  This  is  accomplished  by
controlling the spread of various animal diseases within the country.

The Bill intends to regulate the management  of  those  controlled  diseases
that have a direct bearing on the livestock industry. For effective  disease
control, fencing is a prerequisite, otherwise the  poor  provinces  will  be
overburdened with unfunded mandates. During periods  of  disease  outbreaks,
it becomes essential that infected herds are separated from clean  herds  by
solid fences. The provision of fencing will also  address  the  question  of
stray animals, which if left unchecked will not only pose a threat  to  road
users but will also serve as potential carriers of diseases.

The necessity of this legislation, which seeks to safeguard both animal  and
human health, cannot be overemphasised. May I express the  concerns  of  our
legislature in the province. First and foremost, we do not think the  pounds
at local government level are properly managed. This is an issue  that  will
have to be addressed

Secondly, whilst protocol agreements and  bilateral  agreements,  provide  a
basis for countries to get into symbiotic processes, the issue that  remains
is the issuing of certificates for inspection  on  exportation.  This  is  a
matter that we are also concerned about.  Our  committee  expressed  concern
about  the  legal  and  economic  implications  of  exportation  without   a
certificate. The view  expressed  was  that  where  animals  or  things  are
exported to another country without a certificate, the  exporter  would  not
be in a position to defend him or herself if an exported animal or thing  is
alleged to have had a disease at the time of the exportation.

The economic impact could be  that  such  a  country  may  cease  to  import
animals or things from  South  Africa.  Our  experience  is  that  with  the
Newcastle disease outbreak in our province, where most of our  farmers  were
exporting to Europe, exportation came to an abrupt  end.  As  a  result,  we
then began to deploy veterinary doctors at most of the farms  where  ostrich
farming is an economic activity.

We are of a view that animals should be inspected before sale,  particularly
if they are for export purposes. The  concern  we  are  expressing  also  is
about meat handling. There should be  a  standard  set  by  the  country  to
handle meat in abattoirs. Those are the concerns expressed by our province.

Another issue is that in our province there are people moving  from  Lesotho
to areas like Sterkspruit and Herschel, who are employed in those  areas  as
shepherds. When they are robbed by those farmers in that they are  not  well
paid, they pay themselves by taking our animals back to  Lesotho,  and  this
is very problematic. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, arising from what the Deputy Minister  said
in ... [Interjections.] ... I  will  take  my  orders  from  the  Chair.  In
connection with what the Chair ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Mr Van  Niekerk,  will  you  sit  down
please.

Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, on a point of clarity, may I ask  a  question  of
the previous speaker?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! What is clarity? What point?

Ms C-S BOTHA: Sorry, Chairperson, it is a  point  of  order  concerning  the
previous speaker. May I ask a question?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The member has finished speaking, hon Botha.
Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, I tried to attract  your  attention  to  ask  the
member a question.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, I am  very  sorry  to  say
so, but the member has finished. [Interjections.] Hon Mr Mamase,  would  you
be prepared to take a question?

Uyala. [He is refusing.]

Mr M M MAMASE: Hon Chair, yes, I will take a question.

Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, thank you very much. I would like to ask the  hon
member whether I am interpreting his speech correctly when he suggests  that
theft is an acceptable substitute for payment?

Mr M M MAMASE: Chairperson, I did not say that.

The CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  The  matter  is  closed.  Hon  Van
Niekerk, you may continue.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, arising from what the Deputy Minister  said
in connection with anthrax being primarily a  disease  of  animals  and  the
outbreaks we had  in  the  Northern  Cape,  I  just  want  to  say  that  in
connection with the terrorist threats and strategy  to  infect  people  with
anthrax, I was rather shocked during the week when I learnt  that  there  is
apparently  no  strategy  in  place  in  which  the  hon  the  Minister  for
Agriculture and Land  Affairs  and  the  Minister  of  Health  engage  in  a
holistic approach to see how this should be dealt with in  South  Africa.  I
am totally aware of the capacity of Onderstepoort to supply vaccines, but  I
am sure with this threat there should be a holistic approach.

To carry on with that aspect, in this House we very often  mention  that  we
should have an emergency response strategy in place, and some of us do  have
this piece of paper on our desks. But this has not  been  updated.  It  does
not deal with the threat that we have now. Proof of that is the  clumsy  way
in which the threat was handled on Wednesday in  Tuynhuys,  and  as  we  sit
here about 100m from this Council there is another anthrax threat.

We do not know how to handle it. Should I take the envelope, if I  get  one,
and take it to the presiding officers, or to the councillors I do not  like?
Do we know how to handle it?  We  do  not  know.  This  is  a  very  serious
situation, and I am sorry to bring it up in this specific debate.

In connection with the Bill itself, in the light  of  the  impact  epidemics
like foot-and-mouth disease can have on agriculture, we feel  very  strongly
that the national executive officer and the  provincial  executive  officers
to be appointed cannot  be,  as  stated  in  the  Bill,  just  veterinarians
working  for  the  national  Department  of  Agriculture.  They  should   be
registered with the Veterinary Council as well. We would also  want  to  see
the  national  executive  officer,  in  consultation  with  the   provincial
executive officer, amend or withdraw decisions of the  provincial  executive
officer. This cannot be done unilaterally, as stated in the Bill.

Another matter that is very important is the positioning of  the  quarantine
station. This station must be at least a kilometre away from other  animals,
because bovine malignant catarrhal fever - commonly known as  ``snotsiekte''
- of wildebeest can infect other animals as far as one kilometre away.  This
is very important, and the Bill does not deal with it.

It is also of vital importance to look at what fair  market  value  is  when
animals are to be slaughtered, owing to, for instance, an outbreak of  foot-
and-mouth disease, as we had in KwaZulu-Natal where  not  just  millions  of
rand are at stake but also the livelihoods of many communities. The  genetic
value  and  the  reproduction  value  of  the  stock  must  be  taken   into
consideration as well.

We have a problem in this country in connection with capacity.  The Bill  is
fine; the Act is fine. They must be there, but  we  just  do  not  have  the
capacity to comply with what is expected from us. Let me  give  an  example.
The OIE's requirement for veterinarians in  a  province  like  the  Northern
Cape is 16.

Ons het 16 veeartse in die Noord-Kaap nodig. Daar is tans vier en  ons  hoop
om nog twee aan te stel wat die  getal  op  ses  te  staan  sal  bring.  Ons
posisie is dus sodanig dat ons hoegenaamd nie aan die vereistes kan  voldoen
nie.

Ons sal ernstig daaraan moet werk om dit reg te stel. As  ons  nie  aan  die
veeartsenykundige vereistes kan voldoen nie, kan ons  soveel  wette  op  die
wetboek h√™ soos ons wil, dit gaan niks help nie.

Die gedagte wat die agb minister geopper  het  ten  opsigte  van  intensiewe
boerdery wat w√™reldwyd toeneem om regtig vermo√´ te bou  en  ontwikkeling  te
bevorder,  is  'n   uitstekende   gedagte.   Maar,   eerstens,   skiet   die
internasionale vereistes dit in die voet en, tweedens,  is  ons  opleidings-
en voorligtingsgeriewe nie  goed  genoeg  om  mense  in  staat  te  stel  om
intensiewe boerdery te vervolmaak en te bedryf op 'n grondslag  waaruit  ons
regtig voordeel kan trek nie.

Dit is aspekte waaraan ons baie ernstig sal moet aandag gee.

Ons  ondersteun  die   wysigingswetsontwerp.   (Translation   of   Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[We need 16 veterinarians in the Northern  Cape.  There  are  only  four  at
present and we hope to appoint two more which  would  bring  the  number  to
six. Our  position  is  therefore  such  that  we  cannot  comply  with  the
requirements in any way.

We should seriously work on this matter to rectify it. If we  cannot  comply
with the veterinary requirements, we can have as many Acts  on  the  Statute
Book as we like, but it would not help in any way.

The idea the hon the Minister mentioned with regard  to  intensive  farming,
which has increased worldwide, to  really  build  capacity  and  to  promote
development  is  an  excellent  idea.  But,   firstly,   the   international
requirements are shooting this in the foot, and secondly  our  training  and
extension facilities are  not  good  enough  to  enable  people  to  perfect
intensive farming and to manage it on a  basis  from  which  we  can  really
profit.

These are aspects to which we should really give serious attention.

We support the amending Bill.]

Mr P I MALEFANE (Gauteng): Chairperson, there is a saying  that  people  are
what they eat, and I believe that as human beings  owe  their  existence  to
nature, so animals should be viewed within that  context  which  allows  for
the promotion of animal health and the control of contagious diseases.

As  Gauteng  we  are  pleased  that   Government,   while   addressing   the
socioeconomic needs of poor people, does not abdicate its responsibility  of
providing an environment that is habitable for both humans and  animals.  We
should be informed that an environment  that  does  not  take  care  of  the
spread  of  disease  from  animals  puts  at  risk  everything  that  lives,
including human beings.

It is also important to indicate that it  is  high  time  provinces  take  a
proactive step in building capacity to promote animal health  programmes  in
their areas. Gauteng, for instance, played a major role  in  the  successful
combating of  the  foot-and-mouth  disease  outbreak  in  KwaZulu-Natal  and
Mpumalanga. This outbreak had a negative effect  on  exports.  Priority  was
therefore given to certification, inspection and traceability, as  a  result
of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak,  in  order  to  safeguard  continued
exports.

This Bill emphasises the need to ensure that no animal enters or leaves  the
borders of our country without a permit, and also reinforces  the  need  for
consistency in terms of how  animals  are  handled,  which  promotes  animal
welfare.

We hope that the national department  will  also  assist  in  ensuring  that
provinces do play their part in the implementation of this Bill once  it  is
law, and that they unlock resources to build capacity where  such  resources
are urgently needed. Failure to do so will make our laws  paper  tigers.  We
therefore support and vote in favour of this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr V V Z WINDVO√´L: Chairperson, hon  Deputy  Minister  for  Agriculture  and
Land Affairs and hon members, it is unfortunate that in my maiden  speech  I
will start by reacting to what was raised by the hon Mrs  Rossouw  from  the
Western Cape, who mentioned that a certain clause of  the  Bill  may  be  in
conflict with their provincial constitution. I am not sure how long it  will
last or stand the test of  time,  because  the  political  scenario  in  the
Western Cape is changing faster than the speed of sound. [Laughter.]

However, I must say when this  matter  was  raised  in  the  committee,  the
department was very clear that the right to choice by any  province  is  not
prohibited. The same goes even for other provinces, not  in  particular  the
Western Cape. I do understand that due to the DA fiasco it may  happen  that
the hon Versfeld could not report back on this matter to the  committee.  It
should further be understood from  what  the  Deputy  Minister  stated  that
animal diseases know no  boundaries,  hence  one  will  never  ever  have  a
provincial or municipal animal disease.

The purpose of this Bill is to provide mechanisms  to  promote  the  further
development of our agriculture through the combating of animal diseases.  It
would be difficult to understand the impact of this Bill without looking  at
the impact which  animal  diseases  have  on  the  economies  of  developing
countries. Lessening the impact  of  animal  diseases  on  the  agricultural
countries is very important, particularly in developing  countries  such  as
our own, where agriculture contributes a significant portion  to  our  gross
domestic product.

The Deputy Minister - and I will not  make  the  mistake  which  was  nearly
committed by Mr  Van  Niekerk  and  call  him  ``Deputy  President''  -  has
adequately and eloquently  reflected  on  the  spinoffs  of  having  healthy
livestock and quality  by-products.  By  proactively  promoting  health  and
combating disease in animals, our country  can  significantly  mitigate  the
potential losses which may be suffered by outbreaks of animal disease,  such
as the recent foot-and-mouth disease. As a developing  country  we  can  ill
afford the lost revenues and the eradication,  decontamination,  vaccination
and restocking costs which such  diseases  usually  incur.  Neither  can  we
afford the societal effects which  sometimes  accompany  the  major  disease
outbreaks, such as a threat to  human  health  and  the  destabilisation  of
whole communities.

Unlike developed countries, which often have  more  effective  lobbies  with
their trading partners and within  influential  organisations  such  as  the
World Trade Organisation and the European Union, the agricultural sector  in
developing  countries  has  a  more  difficult  time  in  convincing   these
organisations and other trading partners  that  their  animals  are  disease
free. Sometimes small farmers in developing countries also do not  have  the
resources of a developed country's economy, such  as  government  assistance
to restock quickly enough to reduce potential losses as a result of a  major
outbreak of animal diseases.

However,  we  must  mention  that  there  is  provision  in  the  Bill   for
compensation to be made to those farmers who have lost their  livestock  due
to any animal disease. It is only by having regard to this context that  one
can really appreciate the importance of legislation  like  this.  This  Bill
will go a long way in ensuring that  our  country  keeps  its  integrity  by
ensuring that our export animals comply with  the  international  standards,
guidelines and procedures for the control and prevention of animal  disease.
It creates a workable structure in terms of which the  different  levels  of
government should work together to combat animal disease by setting out  the
powers and  functions  of  the  national  executive  officer  and  the  nine
provincial executives.

The Bill strictly regulates the export and import of animals from  and  into
South Africa. The need for  strict  controls  is  obvious.  It  is  both  to
protect the good image of our country and to protect domestic  animals  from
diseases which  may  be  carried  by  imported  animals.  In  terms  of  the
exporting of animals, the national executive officer must  issue  an  export
health certificate, although there are certain  exceptions  as  the  Eastern
Cape has correctly mentioned.  This  gives  a  guarantee  to  the  importing
country that the animals are in a healthy state based  on  the  requirements
of the importing country. This is necessary to  create  international  trust
in South African animals and their by-products.

In so far as the import of animals is  concerned,  the  Bill  requires  that
import permits  accompany  consignments  of  animals  and  animal  products.
Provision is also made for the establishment of  quarantine  camps  for  the
accommodation of any imported animal or animal product that is  required  in
terms of this Bill to be isolated.

I have no doubt whatsoever that this Bill will further  elevate  our  status
as  a  country  with  a  good  record  of  animal  health.  If   implemented
successfully,  this  Bill  will  greatly  contribute  in  expanding   trade,
improving nutrition, exploiting ecotourism and ensuring food  security.  The
ANC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  let  me
just say at the beginning that that cannot be a maiden  speech.  That  class
of speech should be made by a Deputy  Minister  today.  [Laughter.]  I  must
thank the ANC for always coming to the assistance  of  their  comrades,  and
giving the ministerial speech.

I would just like to make a few comments. The hon Malefane reflected on  the
negative effect on exports, and Ms Rossouw also  referred  to  that  matter.
That is the problem. Last year we had the  problem  with  the  exporting  of
animals to Spain, animals such as zebras  and  giraffes.  In  Spain  it  was
stopped in the ports. We know that zebras carry  horse  sickness.  How  does
one say it in English? Horse disease.  ``Perdesiekte''.  [Laughter.]  Zebras
are carrying it. We could not stop that under the previous legislation,  but
now we can do it. This is clearing up a  lot  of  problems  for  us  at  the
moment.

We have to have controls, and that is what the hon Ms Versfeld referred  to.
The international organisations require the national authority  to  be  able
to do  this.  I  really  hope  that  we  have  covered  all  the  loopholes.
Basically, this will be  as  good  as  the  system  that  we  are  going  to
operationalise.  We  can  have  a  very  good  law,  but  we  must  go   and
operationalise it and build our capacity.

I am aware that there is the problem of  not  having  enough  vets  and  the
capacity in the province.  We  are  in  this  together,  both  national  and
provincial government. The hon Mamase referred to  unfunded  mandates.  That
is the problem, because we have to get the funding. I must say that  in  the
new budget we are strengthening veterinary  services  at  a  huge  rate.  Dr
Mogajane is here and she is heading this. I have  the  highest  respect  for
her. We cannot do this without  the  MECs  and  cannot  do  it  without  the
officials. We must make a team effort. This is a national challenge that  we
are facing.
The hon Van Niekerk referred to the  capacity.  I  have  given  instructions
that we must look at the bursary scheme  at  Onderstepoort.  The  veterinary
profession is  becoming  a  female  profession.  It  is  a  good  thing.  At
Onderstepoort, in the faculty there, over 65% -  I  am  guessing  now  -  of
students are women.

HON MEMBERS: Good!

The DEPUTY MINISTER: It is a good thing, but a lot of them have  their  eyes
on pet practices in cities. This  is  a  good  thing,  and  I  have  nothing
against it. A lot of people are also going  overseas.  It  is  mostly  white
females I am talking about. I have nothing against  white  females  becoming
vets. It is excellent. It is a loving and caring profession.

But to go up to the remote northern areas  such  as  Pongolo  and  Makhatini
Flats one needs tough people to go and work with the big  animals  there.  I
am not saying that they are not tough, but what we need is to  promote  more
black veterinarians in this country. The  intake  this  year  was  three  in
Onderstepoort. I have given strict instructions, and  Dr  Mogajane  and  the
dean of the faculty at Onderstepoort and other staff members are working  on
getting a bursary scheme going, because men and women who want  to  go  into
commercial animal practice - what we call production animal practice,  which
is what the economy needs - must be found in the rural areas.  They  do  not
come from Batho in Mangaung. People  who  want  to  work  with  animals  and
become vets come from the rural areas. The faculty at Onderstepoort now  has
a unit which goes  around  schools  trying  to  get  people  to  study  this
subject. We have to get the people and put up the numbers.

Let me just say that Onderstepoort - the research  facilities,  the  faculty
and all the different institutes there - is  one  of  the  great  assets  of
South Africa. We have to maintain that. The animal hospital there is such  a
fine place. If I get ill, I want to be treated there. I must still  take  my
last penicillin for protection against anthrax.  [Laughter.]  Where  is  it?
This is what it looks like, in case members are exposed to anthrax.  I  must
still finish my course  of  penicillin,  because  I  was  involved  in  that
anthrax scare.

While I am talking about anthrax, let  me  say  that  there  is  a  national
strategy  on  anthrax.  It  is  a  holistic   approach   between   different
departments of agriculture and the national  Department  of  Health.  It  is
currently led by Nia, the National  Intelligence  Agency,  and  there  is  a
definite way to treat this matter. I must say that I was most  impressed  by
the way it was handled when we had the hoax  at  Tuynhuys  and  the  way  in
which the staff, in South Africa, handled this type of  thing  and  also  at
the hospital that we were taken to. I am really  impressed  and  I  have  no
fear that we cannot handle this type  of  thing.  We  have  the  people  and
knowledge to treat this thing. But the problem is the hoaxes.

Let me make a few more comments. I think I will ask for a transcript of  the
hon Rossouw's speech and we will study it in closer  detail.  If  necessary,
we will respond to that. I think we must  also  have  copies  of  the  other
speeches.
The hon Versfeld must not be worried about research. Of course there  was  a
cut, but the Government is extremely aware of the  importance  of  research.
We lose people, but we must  realise  that  research  is  an  international,
globalised profession. People go to other places and other  people  come  to
South Africa. I met the most wonderful Polish  researcher  at  Onderstepoort
who is doing wonderful work there. So this is the way it goes. We  must  not
always see something abnormal always in losing personnel. There  are  always
people coming around. This is an international profession.

Let me just tell the hon Mamase  quickly  that  pounds  are  a  big  problem
because they are operated at local government level. But we have to  support
that. We must work out a system. In actual fact we are  coming  with  a  new
Bill on pounds next year because of the problems  of  theft,  stray  animals
and disease control. Everything is contained in that,  and  we  cannot  just
say the local  government  and  the  municipalities  must  find  the  money.
Sometimes it is the poorest municipalities where we have the  biggest  stray
problem. We cannot just say it is their problem.

But there is another thing I need to mention to the hon Mamase. If one  goes
through most of the commercial agricultural areas in South Africa, one  will
see good fencing systems in place  there.  If  one  drives  through  Qwaqwa,
Transkei or wherever, one will see  no  fences.  But  those  fences  in  the
commercial agricultural areas did not just come there from nowhere.  It  was
a systematic support system by different fencing Acts from the 19th  century
in the old colonies and the whole of the 20th century. This was  done  by  a
heavily subsidised system. It was one of those situations in  which  when  a
farmer wanted to pay less in taxes, he would put up a fence. That was  never
done in some of the traditional areas in South Africa, and we cannot  expect
the fencing systems to happen by themselves. We will have to do  it  in  the
public interest and have a support system. It is a matter of safety.  It  is
about animal diseases and all the matters the hon member mentioned. We  will
have to make a plan, put it into place and have a support system.  Otherwise
we will never be able to have an advanced agricultural system. We must  talk
about that.

I think I made some comments on exports without permits. We can take  it  up
within the technical groupings in the departments as well.

I must thank the Rev  Moatshe,  I  have  noted  what  he  said  -  that  the
consultation was not sufficient. We take note  of  that.  We  will  have  to
attend to this matter in future.

I must thank the Council for the debate  and  the  support  that  they  have
given us, and I really enjoyed being here.

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution

(KwaZulu-Natal abstaining).

The Council adjourned at 11:40.

TABLINGS:

National Council of Provinces:

Papers:

1.    The Chairperson:


     The President of the Republic submitted the following letter, dated  29
     October 2001, to the Chairperson of the National Council  of  Provinces
     informing Parliament of the employment of the  South  African  National
     Defence Force:


     Dear Ms Pandor,


     REPORT IN TERMS OF SECTION 201(3) OF THE CONSTITUTION OF  THE  REPUBLIC
     OF SOUTH AFRICA, 1996 (ACT 108 OF 1996) ON THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE  SOUTH
     AFRICAN NATIONAL DEFENCE FORCE IN TERMS OF SECTION (201)(2)(c)  OF  THE
     CONSTITUTION, 1996 IN THE FULFILLMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION TO
     THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI


     This serves to inform the National Council  of  Provinces  that  on  26
     October 2001, I authorised the employment  of  South  African  National
     Defence Force personnel to the Republic of Burundi in fulfillment of an
     international obligation. This employment was authorised in  accordance
     with the provisions of Sections 82(4)(b)(ii) of the Constitution of the
     Republic of South Africa, 1993 (Act No 200 of 1993),  [which  continues
     to be in force in terms of Item 24(1) of Schedule 6 to the Constitution
     of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act No 108 of 1996)], as well as
     Section 201(2)(c) of the  said  Constitution  of  1996,  as  read  with
     Section 227(1)(b) of the Constitution of 1993.


     This employment is in response to a request from the Government of  the
     Republic of Burundi and the facilitator of the peace  process  in  that
     country, former President Nelson Mandela. The United Nations  has  also
     endorsed this deployment.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  South  African
     military contingent will  form  part  of  a  multinational  force.  The
     deployment is  in  compliance  with  the  Republic  of  South  Africa's
     international obligations towards support to the peace process  in  the
     Republic of Burundi in the  mission  of  rendering  protection  support
     services  to  returning  opposition  leaders   participating   in   the
     Transitional  Government.  This  forms   a   critical   part   of   the
     implementation  of  the  Arusha  Peace  and  Reconciliation  Agreement.
     According to the Agreement, the transitional government in Burundi will
     start their activities on 1 November 2001.


     The deployment will consist of 1 431 military personnel. The  estimated
     period of deployment will be from 25 October 2001 until June 2002.
     Based on the latest available information (as at 22 October 2001),  the
     estimated expenditure for a twelve month period  to  mobilise,  deploy,
     sustain, rotate and demobilise  the  anticipated  force  structure  and
     equipment amounts to US$M158 (RB1, 501  where  US$1  =  R9.50).  Former
     President Nelson Mandela has negotiated donor funding for the operation
     from countries such as Belgium and the USA, as  well  as  the  European
     Union.


     I will also communicate this report to the National Assembly  and  wish
     to request that you bring it to  the  notice  of  the  Members  of  the
     National Council of Provinces.


     Yours sincerely,




     T M MBEKI
