                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  I  shall  move  at
the next sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with shock the death of a four-month-old baby who was allegedly
       attacked by gigantic rats at Sebokeng Hospital;


  (2) further notes that the hospital medical  superintendent  acknowledged
       that there is a rat problem in the hospital;


  (3) finds it unacceptable that the required precautions  were  not  taken
       timeously to ensure the safety of patients in the hospital; and


  (4) calls on the Department of Health and all other  structures  involved
       with the safety of  patients  to  take  precautions  to  prevent  the
       reoccurrence of such a nasty health hazard.

Ms B N DLULANE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move  at  the
next sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the DA leader, Tony Leon, has finally had the courage  to  admit
           that his party is dominated by whites and that it has to attract
           more blacks;


       (b)  Mr Leon admits that the African National  Congress  has  brought
           freedom to all South Africans including himself; and


       (c)  the division which  manifests  itself  in  terms  of  leadership
           within the Democratic Alliance poses a question whether a  small
           party like the DA, which cannot consolidate its  own  party  and
           deal with its own problems, can lead the entire country;


  (2) congratulates the Democratic Alliance on  presenting  their  internal
       squabbles to the ANC; and


  (3) acknowledges that this entails that the DA has finally realised  that
       the ANC is the only party that can bring a better life for all.

[Interjections.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the Council:


  That the Council calls upon the Receiver of  Revenue  to  look  into  all
  cases of improper benefits received in cash or  kind  by  any  person  of
  official arising from the  arms  deal,  as  well  as  any  other  similar
  Government  transactions,   and   to   impose   maximum   penalties   for
  nondisclosure of benefits received.

       (b)  statistieke van April verlede jaar tot  Maart  vanjaar  wys  dat
           daar 'n reuse toename in dwelmgebruik is en dat veral die  syfer
           onder laerskoolleerlinge uiters kommerwekkend is;


       (c)  dwelmbase hulle veral daarop toespits om kinders  as  kopers  en
           verkopers te werf; en


       (d)  'n grootskaalse gemeenskaplike poging van  ouers,  gemeenskappe,
           opvoeders, die polisie en ander  regeringsinstellings  sowel  as
           nie-regeringsorganisasies nodig is om die dwelmprobleme van  ons
           land op te los en ons jeug uit dié bose wurggreep te kry;


  (2) sy volle steun verleen aan pogings om  oplossings  te  vind  vir  die
       toenemende dwelmprobleem onder  ons  bevolking  en  om  ons  jeug  te
       beskerm teen die gewetenlose uitbuiting deur dwelmbase; en


  (3) 'n beroep op die Regering  doen  om  maatreëls  te  verskerp  om  die

       (c)  druglords concentrate their efforts on  recruiting  children  as

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council notes that -


  (1) today marks the 46th anniversary  of  the  adoption  of  the  Freedom
       Charter, which declared a nonracial,  nonsexist  South  Africa  which

       putting together this Charter;


  (4) for years, the Freedom Charter has  been  a  living  document  -  for
       decades its eloquence has adequately  answered  the  question  ``What
       kind of South Africa do we want?''; and


  (5) this vision described in the Freedom Charter continues to inspire the
       struggles  of  South  Africa's  people,  to  guide  the  process   of
       fundamental social change and its principles remain at the  heart  of
       the objectives of the ANC and the Government.

  CALL FOR ASSISTANCE TO EMERGING AND SUBSISTENCE FARMERS IN THE NORTH WEST

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Madam Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern that -


       (a)  a large proportion of the emerging and  subsistence  farmers  in
           the North West, which is predominantly rural, are on  the  verge
           of liquidation and bankruptcy due to a  lack  of  the  necessary
           resources and climatic conditions; and


       (b)  many of the rural dwellers who depended  on  agriculture,  which
           had always been their main employer,  are  now  facing  a  bleak
           future and this has aggravated  the  cycle  of  poverty  in  the
           province; and


  (2) calls on the powers that be to assist the farmers to resuscitate this
       industry and to stop allegations that the  UCDP  leader  spoiled  the
       farmers with nonrefundable loans during drought periods.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection  to  the  motion?
[Interjections.] There is an objection. The  motion  will  therefore  become

       gelê.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Ms E C GOUWS: Madam Chairperson, I move without notice:

  (1) notes that -


       (a)  one of South  Africa's  best  young  swimmers,  the  17-year-old

             FAST-TRACKING OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AMENDMENT BILL

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson,  I  move  the  draft  resolution
printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:
  That the Council ratifies the decision the Joint  Programme  Subcommittee
  took on 20 June 2001 in accordance with Joint Rule  216(2),  namely  that
  the Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill [B 37 - 2001] be  fast-tracked  by,
  where necessary, shortening any period  within  which  any  step  in  the
  legislative process relating to the Bill must be completed, in order  for
  the Bill to be passed by both  Houses  of  Parliament  before  Parliament
  adjourns in June 2001 (see Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports,
  p 733).

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 26 - Environmental Affairs and Tourism:

The MINISTER OF  ENVIRONMENTAL  AFFAIRS  AND  TOURISM:  Chairperson,  it  is
indeed an honour and a privilege for me to present my  introduction  to  the
policy debate on the occasion of the anniversary  of  the  adoption  of  the
Freedom Charter. Way back in 1955, representatives of the  oppressed  people
of this country came together and declared for all of the world to know  and
hear, ``South Africa belongs to all who live in it.'' They were bold  enough
to declare, ``The people shall govern.'' That was  right  in  the  belly  of
apartheid and in the darkest days of the  oppression  of  our  country,  and
many critics thought that this was simply a pipe dream.  But  here  we  are,
elected representatives of the people, and we are governing. It is  a  great
privilege for us to be conducting this debate today.

When I addressed the National Assembly a few weeks ago, I  made  an  appeal:
As South Africans we must act while we can to protect the environment.  This
requires decisive action and  can  only  happen  if  all  three  spheres  of
government act together. The NCOP has a special place in the  governance  of
our country. This is where the three  spheres  interact  to  give  real  and
practical meaning to co-operative governance  on  issues  of  pollution  and
waste, the growth of tourism and the management of our protected  areas  and
our coastline.

This unity in action is the best weapon to  combat  poverty  with  practical
programmes. I therefore wish to use this opportunity to  highlight  some  of
the practical ways we are working with provinces and  local  governments  to
address environmental and tourist issues and  raise  some  concerns  that  I
believe we need to address in this relationship.

The  constitutional  role  of  provincial  and  local  government  in  waste
management is  critical.  Refuse  removal,  refuse  dumps  and  solid  waste
disposal are Schedule 5B  functions  of  local  government  under  exclusive
provincial legislative competence. We cannot speak  of  an  effective  waste
management system without talking about the role to be played by  provincial
and local governments.

Currently, 566 million tons of municipal waste is generated  every  year  by
our country. This is a mountain  of  waste.  Only  a  fraction  of  this  is
recycled or reclaimed in any way. When we were preparing  for  this  speech,
most municipalities were unable to give us accurate  figures  on  waste  and
recycling even within their municipal  areas.  Where  is  this  mountain  of
waste going to?

There is a crisis pertaining to  illegal  landfilled  sites  that  continues
unabated, and this includes municipal authorities. Of the 710  landfills  in
South  Africa,  49%  are  illegal  and  do  not  comply  with  environmental
legislation. Some municipalities are complicit in this, and are using  these
landfills illegally. Proper refuse collection is an essential service and  a
basic right. At the moment, 40% of South  Africa's  people  do  not  have  a
proper domestic refuse collection system, which means that  waste  piles  up
around their homes, degrades their environments and  affects  their  health.
We have a national obligation to ensure that  minimum  standards  for  waste
management are met.

The actions taken by provinces to address these  problems  are  clearly  not
adequate. In this regard it is important that we  do  the  basics  right.  A
consistent refuse removal mechanism and strategy,  the  provision  of  basic
dustbins in previously  neglected  areas  and  the  proper  organisation  of
landfill sites in a manner that facilitates effective recycling  are  things
that can be done with the current resources at our disposal. This should  be
linked  to  environmentally  friendly,  integrated  development  plans   for
municipalities. We have to act before it is too late.

My department has actively supported waste management  projects  around  the
country which aim to demonstrate that waste management can be improved on  a
sustainable basis and that jobs and development can be delivered as part  of
this. I am proud to announce that this year we will spend an additional  R32
million  on  waste  projects  linked  to  poverty  alleviation  targets  and
contributing to  Government's  overall  work  on  urban  renewal  and  rural
development.

On 25 September 2001 this year my department  will  host  a  national  waste
summit in conjunction with the nine provinces, as decided upon at  a  recent
Minmec, whose key objectives will be to engage all Government  agencies  and
other stakeholders in practical strategies to implement the national  policy
on integrated waste management. It will also  be  a  golden  opportunity  to
increase awareness among South Africans that they need to act before  it  is
too late.

The socioeconomic development of South Africa and the health of  its  people
can  no  longer  be  affected  by  uncontrolled  and  unco-ordinated   waste
management. During World Environment Week this year,  when  I  attended  the
main function in Bloemfontein in  Batho  township,  I  announced  that  next
year, on World Environment Day, Government would be announcing the  name  of
what we consider to be the cleanest town in the  country  and  we  would  be
making available a reward of R1 million to that town for being the  cleanest
town.

We went further, then, and said - and  I  will  keep  this  promise  -  that
together with that, we will name and  shame  what  we  consider  to  be  the
dirtiest town  in  the  country.  [Interjections.]  I  will  be  requesting,
through the provincial MECs when we next  get  an  opportunity  to  meet  in
Minmec, that we start the build-up at the provincial level and that we  name
the cleanest town for each of the nine provinces and the  dirtiest  town  in
each province, in a build-up to the national awards as such. I do hope  that
I will get the  co-operation  of  the  NCOP  in  unfolding  this  programme,
because  somebody  is  going  to  have  to  make  what  is   an   acceptable
determination of which is the cleanest and which is the dirtiest.

The control of air pollution  is  another  local  government  function  that
currently is inadequately performed. Only 131 municipalities do any form  of
air quality monitoring, and of these  only  97  take  any  steps  to  ensure
compliance. Most township areas - and this is a shame - still  fall  outside
declared smoke control areas, and township  residents  are  exposed  to  the
most appalling  levels  of  air  pollution  from  coal  smoke  and  adjacent
industries. In parts of the Vaal triangle today  one  is  not  able  to  see
one's neighbour standing across the street from where one  is,  because  the
air pollution is so bad.
We have already taken steps to publish new guidelines for the  reduction  in
the emissions of SO2  and next year it is our aim to  present  a  clean  air
Act, which will of course be a clean air Bill when we present it here.  This
Bill is aimed at regularising the situation, particularly when it  comes  to
municipalities fulfilling their responsibilities in this regard.

I would like to announce  that  we  have  taken  a  decision  to  avail  the
aircraft of the  weather  bureau  in  pollution  hotspots  to  increase  our
capacity for random monitoring, particularly monitoring the emission  levels
that are coming from industries.

The bioregional approach to conservation in South Africa  recently  released
by our department is an  indication  of  the  tremendous  progress  made  in
conservation in our country since 1994. Over 155 000 ha  of  land  has  been
added to conservation. This is  the  biggest  expansion  in  any  comparable
period in the history of conservation in South Africa. We hope to  grow  the
current 6% of conservation land in South Africa  to  8%  over  the  next  10
years, in order to sustain this trend.

The provinces have a critical role to  play  in  managing  the  conservation
areas of our country, and improving the standard of  our  provincial  parks.
Much  criticism  has  been  levelled  against  the  state  of  some  of  our
provincial parks and we indeed have a problem in this regard. I am  informed
that in every single province there has been a steady decline in real  terms
in the conservation budgets. We are spending less  and  less  in  rands  per
hectare on managing provincial reserves.  Income  from  provincial  reserves
has also been declining and the parks suffer in provinces where  the  income
goes back to the central Treasury. My department has been  working  actively
with provinces to address this crisis, and in many instances is  intervening
directly to protect biodiversity  that  is  of  national  and  international
significance.

I must say, though, that it is heartening to note that most provinces  will,
over the next three years, increase their  budgets  for  conservation,  some
even up to 40%. I believe that this stated commitment needs to supported  by
the NCOP, and the provinces should be asked to  report  on  steps  they  are
taking to protect biodiversity. I think initially there was  not  sufficient
realisation in provinces that provincial parks and  provincial  conversation
areas are some of the most important assets  that  provinces  have  and,  if
properly managed, can serve to encourage economic activity and create  jobs.
We hope to publish draft biodiversity legislation towards the  end  of  this
year,  which  will  set  certain  minimum  standards  for  conservation  and
biodiversity management,  and  aim  to  ensure  that  the  heritage  of  our
beautiful country is protected for generations to come.

In  some  areas  progress  is  commendable.  Since  1994  this  country  has
established a total of 26 new parks at both national and  provincial  level,
incorporating the 155 000 hectares that I  spoke  about  into  conservation.
Other developments worth  noting  are  the  signing  of  the  memorandum  of
understanding for the establishment of the Maloti-Drakensberg  Transfrontier
Conservation and Development Area between South Africa and Lesotho just  two
weeks ago; the advance preparations  for  the  establishment  of  the  Gaza-
Kruger-Gonarezhou Transfrontier Park between South  Africa,  Mozambique  and
Zimbabwe; the consolidation of the Greater St  Lucia  Wetlands  Park,  under
the World Heritage Authority, including  some  280  000  ha  of  marine  and
coastal land, and the addition of approximately 7 000 ha of land,  which  up
to now has been under Safcol commercial  forestry;  the  addition  of  three
parks to the National Parks since 1994, and the addition of  74  000  ha  to
the Addo Elephant National Park, 77 000 hectares to the Karoo National  Park
and 50 000  to  Marakele  National  Park.  This  is  an  indication  of  our
seriousness about conservation and our resolve to maximise its  contribution
to the upliftment of the poor.

Tourism is one  of  the  key  economic  growth  sectors  identified  by  the
President  in  his  state-of-the-nation  address  this  year.  Many   towns,
townships and rural areas around our country have  already  taken  advantage
of the benefits of tourism and are using  their  local  heritage  to  create
jobs and make development happen. Local and provincial governments' role  in
building our tourism economy is extremely important. The emergence of  local
tourism forums and initiatives around the country highlights the  fact  that
many communities want to own the tourism dream. With this amount of  support
for our policies on tourism, we can conclude that the  Welcome  campaign  is
beginning to take root amongst the people of South Africa.

Over the last year we have spoken about changing the face  of  tourism.  The
role of provinces in making this a reality  cannot  be  overemphasised.  The
role of local government  in  promoting  township  tourism  is  critical  in
ensuring that the  participation  of  black  entrepreneurs  in  the  tourism
industry is enhanced. I would like to take this opportunity  to  express  my
gratitude to all nine provinces  for  the  manner  in  which  the  provinces
supported emerging black enterprises to be represented for  the  first  time
at the tourism indaba held in Durban in April this year.  We  experienced  a
300% to 400% increase in the number of black-owned  enterprises  represented
there, largely as a result of the support and  encouragement  given  by  the
provinces.

We are also  encouraged  by  the  interest  that  the  SA  Local  Government
Association has taken in co-operating with my  department  to  make  tourism
everybody's business. Salga has undertaken  to  discuss  a  whole  range  of
issues within its structures in order to give  practical  effect  to  policy
programmes to promote tourism growth. At a national level we are working  to
bring more visitors to the country and to boost tourism demand for the  wide
array of cultural, natural and other beauties of this country. The  benefits
of tourism flow directly to communities  and  have  become  the  cement  for
building a better life for  all  our  people.  I  call  on  all  spheres  of
government and communities to act now to build the  tourism  dream  for  our
country, a wonder that lies waiting.

Addressing  poverty  is  critical  to  sustaining  a  high-quality   coastal
environment from which South Africa draws significant  social  and  economic
benefits. All spheres of government, including the  private  sector  have  a
significant role to  play  in  promoting  the  sustainable  use  of  coastal
resources. The department has embarked on a number of initiatives in  excess
of R150 million through its partnership programme called  Coast  Care.  This
investment has  been  significantly  bolstered  by  the  recently  concluded
contribution of R50 million  from  the  UK's  Department  for  International
Development over the next three  years  to  support  a  sustainable  coastal
livelihoods programme.

Key focus areas of the  mentioned  programme  include  piloting  public  and
private  sector  strategies  to  create  and  promote  sustainable   coastal
livelihoods for the poor and building  national  institutional  capacity  to
support sustainable coastal development. Provision has been  made  to  build
the capacity at provincial level,  with  the  appointment  of  regional  co-
ordinators.

Despite the above plans, there are  those  in  society  who  have  taken  to
plundering our coastal resources through poaching, the  destruction  of  our
coastline by the building of illegal cottages or the driving of vehicles  on
beaches. However, we have decided that we are going to  act  while  we  can.
Last week the Directorate of Public Prosecutions announced  the  seizure  of
approximately  25  tons  of  Patagonian  Toothfish  and  rock  lobster  that
allegedly was being fished illegally and exported by a private  company.  We
will see more arrests and confiscations in the next few months as  a  result
of much improved co-operation with  the  law  enforcement  agencies  in  our
country. However,  the  co-operation  of  coastal  provinces  and  towns  in
compliance is critical.

The close working  relationship  between  my  department  and  KwaZulu-Natal
Wildlife has meant that we  are  able  to  provide  effective  policing  and
control of all fishing and  coastal  activities  in  the  province.  We  are
funding this activity through a contract with KwaZulu-Natal  Wildlife,  paid
out of the revenues of the Marine Living Resources Fund. This year  we  will
negotiate similar  contracts  with  the  Western  Cape,  Northern  Cape  and
Eastern Cape provinces, and aim to establish a coast-to-coast  comprehensive
enforcement regime. The designation of  fishery  control  officer  posts  in
provincial and local authorities is already  in  progress  and  these  staff
members  are  assisting  departmental   law   enforcement   officials   with
compliance operations  on  a  regular,  well-co-ordinated  and  well-planned
basis.

Working for the Coast is a flagship programme of  the  department,  financed
through  poverty  relief  funding.  This  capacity-building   programme   is
structured around developing participants' literacy levels, business  skills
and environmental knowledge. Currently 1 350 people are  employed,  covering
about 60% of the coast. The department has committed R20 million to  funding
poverty relief projects along the coast during this financial year.

By the year 2004 we plan to generate 5 000 direct jobs per annum in  support
of  the  implementation  of  the  White  Paper   for   Sustainable   Coastal
Development in South Africa, targeting priority areas such  as  the  Eastern
Cape.

The Blue Flag  campaign  is  an  international  scheme  that  rewards  local
authorities for providing safe and clean beaches and marinas.  A  blue  flag
is awarded annually to beaches and marinas that meet environmental,  amenity
and safety criteria.

Currently, the Blue Flag campaign in South  Africa  is  in  its  second  and
final pilot phase with 14 participating locations. If this  pilot  phase  is
successful, South Africa will be the first country outside Europe to  become
a member of  the  scheme.  The  department  has  committed  R1,2 million  as
seeding finance for the programme. Sustainability will be  achieved  through
an operating fee for participating locations, and the  motivation  for  this
comes from increased tourism revenue as a result  of  the  association  with
the Blue Flag campaign.

This year has seen the department move forward with  the  implementation  of
the Marine Living Resources Act for subsistence fishers in all four  coastal
provinces. Where a large number of fishers could be  accommodated,  such  as
in the subsistence fishery for West Coast rock lobster in  the  Western  and
Northern Cape, which had over 1 500 entrants in 2001,  the  plight  of  poor
coastal communities was eased significantly.

In the Western Cape access to the abalone resource is currently going  ahead
for a further 200 applicants.  In  the  Eastern  Cape,  permits  to  harvest
abalone have been issued in two sites, Hamburg and  the  East  London  area,
and access to other high-value species such as East Coast rock  lobster  and
oysters has been granted to several hundred fishers on the Wild Coast.

In KwaZulu-Natal management of all subsistence fishing  is  currently  being
done by the provincial  authority  supported  financially  by  the  national
department. In all areas  and  provinces  where  harvesting  is  for  direct
consumption of the subsistence fisher and his or her family,  the  challenge
facing the department is  to  ensure  that  continued  access  to  resources
remains sustainable.

The Johannesburg world summit to be held in September next year presents  us
with an enormous challenge, but also a unique opportunity. The eyes  of  the
world will be focused on us as we play host to over 100 heads of  state  and
at least 50 000 delegates. We have to ensure that Johannesburg is  not  just
about empty promises, but has concrete meaning for the poor  of  the  world.
It is our challenge to mobilise communities to make an input in shaping  the
agenda of this summit.

Logistical preparations for the summit are at an advanced  stage.  Just  two
weeks ago  the  UN  inspection  team  that  visited  Johannesburg  expressed
satisfaction with the level of preparations.

The imminent hosting of the international  conference  of  local  issues  in
South Africa is an ideal opportunity to build up to the summit with a  sense
of the concrete discussions about sustainable development that  must  be  at
the core of the world summit.

Involving our constituencies in preparations for the summit is the best  way
to honour the confidence shown by the UN in  bestowing  this  responsibility
on our country. I therefore wish to call on the NCOP to assist  us  in  this
regard, and facilitate debates  and  discussions  on  this  summit  and  its
preparations,  not  only  in  this  House,  but  also  in   the   provincial
legislatures and in local councils.

In conclusion,  I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  express  my
gratitude to the MECs of the nine provinces  for  the  high  degree  of  co-
operation I have received from them over the past year. I also wish to  take
this opportunity to express my gratitude to  the  select  committee  of  the
NCOP and its chairperson, the  Reverend  Peter  Moatshe,  for  the  valuable
contribution they continue to make to the  work  of  the  Ministry  and  the
department. [Applause.]

[Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson,  hon  Minister  of  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism, delegates from  different  provinces,  premiers,  members  of  this
House, the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, my brothers  and
sisters, greetings!

We have already seen how the  hon  Minister  Valli  Moosa  has  revived  and
uplifted tourism in this  country  through  his  hard  work  and  remarkable
management style. He managed to change tourism from what it used  to  be  in
the past, discriminating against the poor. His tourism projects now  include
African traditional rhythms and culture.  Minister  Valli  Moosa  also  said
that one has to work hard in order to succeed.

Townships, rural areas and even informal settlements have become  remarkable
tourist attractions in our country. Tourists now  have  the  opportunity  to
visit areas which were  not  visited  during  the  apartheid  regime.  These
changes challenge all  citizens  of  South  Africa  to  participate  in  the
widening and development of tourism. An old saying goes,  ``perseverance  is
the mother of success.'']

Through the visionary leadership of the  Minister,  South  Africa  has  been
able to unlock its vast tourism potential to such  an  extent  that  we  are
fast becoming a global player in the tourism industry.

Our tourism industry  is  entering  an  exciting  period.  Having  laid  the
foundation for the transformation of the industry, we can now  move  forward
to vigorously promote the growth of this sector. This  includes  encouraging
more people from previously disadvantaged backgrounds to  make  use  of  the
new opportunities opening up in the industry.

But in order for us to proceed along this road,  it  is  important  to  deal
with some of the remaining obstacles, such as racism  in  the  industry  and
the lack of tourism infrastructure in some of our  poorer  provinces.  These
two factors  have  made  it  difficult  for  black  people  to  really  take
advantage of the opportunities in the tourism sector.

The number of people who have managed to  cut  through  the  red  tape  that
hinders black entrepreneurs from making it in the tourism industry is  still
too low. Some experts have already  warned  that  the  industry  may  become
unsustainable if we do not make it more inclusive.

Despite these warnings, there are still people  and  political  parties  who
think that  the  tourism  industry  is  the  sole  preserve  of  whites.  In
September of last year, the New NP-DP coalition government  in  the  Western
Cape, for example,  organised  a  tourism  indaba  in  Cape  Town  that  was
addressed and attended by almost exclusively white delegates. How  on  earth
can one discuss  the  future  of  tourism  and  the  challenges  facing  the
industry in the absence  of  people  who  constitute  the  majority  of  the
Western Cape's population?

Some of these white tourism companies  have  even  invented  new  strategies
such as rent-a-black to give a nonracial appearance to their companies,  yet
there is no equity between whites and blacks in  the  companies.  Those  who
deny that racism still exists in  the  industry  are  dishonest.  The  Human
Rights Commission  has  been  called  upon  on  a  number  of  occasions  to
investigate charges of racism by some tourist resorts.

The racism of some South African tourism companies has  even  been  felt  as
far away as Mozambique. On 16  April  this  year  Mozambique's  top  tourist
official accused a South African tourist company in  the  Gasa  province  of
racism, for having put up notices at their resorts which read, and I  quote,
``No  entry  for  Mozambican  children.''  Children  of  foreign   tourists,
including South Africans, were, however, allowed in the resorts.

Tourism is commonly accepted as the one sector with the  greatest  potential
for job creation. However, the sector needs to  be  completely  deracialised
if it is to realise its job creation potential. It should have,  as  one  of
its key objectives, the encouragement of real  black  economic  empowerment,
instead  of  the  rent-a-black  strategy  followed  by  some  white  tourism
companies.

The other big problem inhibiting the growth of the  tourism  sector  is  the
skewed distribution of tourism infrastructure, such as transport,  amenities
and other supportive services.

Although we have very good tourism infrastructure, this is mostly  found  in
traditional destinations such as Johannesburg, Durban,  Cape  Town  and  the
Kruger National Park. The same level  of  infrastructure  is  not  found  in
emerging destinations such as the northern parts of the  Northern  Province.
This limits the dispersal  of  tourism  to  this  area  and  other  emerging
destinations, which are gifted  with  an  abundance  of  the  new  types  of
tourism products such as ecotourism and culture,  which  are  fast  becoming
favourite tourist attractions.

For a province such as  the  Northern  Province,  which  has  great  tourism
potential, it is essential that  we  accelerate  the  provision  of  tourism
infrastructure in our emerging destinations. The North  West  province  also
has a great potential in tourism. There are great plans in the pipeline  for
this sector.

This will greatly enhance the speeding up of tourism  development  projects,
such as the Bakenburg tourism development  project,  the  Blouberg  cultural
village and hiking trail, the Bolobedu cultural village and the Hatsama  Dam
cultural village.

The select committee on land and  environmental  affairs  will  continue  to
support Government in its  efforts  to  rid  the  tourism  industry  of  the
obstacles which prevent the industry  from  realising  its  full  potential.
This includes not only support for tourism development, but also support  in
ensuring that our tourism industry develops responsibly.

A key aspect of our tourism development strategy is to  make  sure  that  it
will be able to sustain  future  generations.  This  means  looking  at  the
impact of increased tourism on our ecosystem. I am pleased to say  that  our
Government is aware of the  potential  harm  which  may  be  caused  to  our
environment  through  increased  tourism.  It  has  already   developed   an
integrated pollution and waste management  policy  which  will  serve  as  a
holistic and integrated  strategy  to  deal  with  the  harmful  effects  of
pollution and  waste  disposal,  including  those  that  may  be  caused  by
tourism.

[It is now more important to take care  of  the  South  African  environment
than it was in the past. There is a need to educate the community about  the
importance  of  conserving  their  environment.  The  community  must   stop
littering, and there should  be  antilittering  campaigns  throughout  South
Africa, as the hon the Minister has already indicated.

There should be laws governing the conservation of our environment. A  clean
and attractive environment would elevate the  standard  of  tourism  in  our
country.]

I want to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for  his  co-operation
with the select committee; that cannot be left unmentioned. We want to  wish
the Minister and the department an energetic time  in  future,  as  we  move
into the 21st century, so that the environment and tourism sector  takes  up
the challenge and makes an impact upon the entire world.

I want to thank the department in particular,  the  members  of  the  select
committee and the provinces as we interact with them as the NCOP  from  this
end. I want to thank those who are present here: the MECs, chairpersons  and
special delegates.

Ka mafoko a ka re, pula a e ne! [Legofi.] [With those few words, I wish  all
members prosperity. [Applause.]]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson,  hon  Minister  Moosa,  MECs  for  environmental
affairs and colleagues, virtually all, if not all,  religions  and  cultures
accept that nature was created by the Almighty for His  creatures  to  enjoy
and to benefit from all its different facets: nature in the form  of  earth,
water, plants and animals, of which we, as human beings, are the  custodians
and which we have a sacred responsibility to protect and cherish.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Can  you  speak
into your microphone, hon member?

Dr E A CONROY: Must I start all over again?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): The clock is ticking.

Dr E A CONROY: We  do  so  also  for  the  sake  of  our  children  and  our
children's children until the end of time.

It is therefore necessary that we should have some sort  of  mechanism  that
will unite our efforts to protect our  God-given  natural  heritage  and  to
manage it in a sustainable way. That mechanism exists  in  South  Africa  in
the form of the Ministry and the Department  of  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism.

The  strategic  approaches  of  the  department  to  performing  this   very
important task placed on its shoulders are the promotion of economic  growth
through sustainable development; the utilisation and the protection  of  our
natural and cultural resources; the empowerment of all  our  people  through
participation,  environmental  education,  capacity-building,  research  and
information services; the conservation of nature; the creation of  a  better
living environment and the improvement of the present and future quality  of
life; the  building  of  a  common  patriotism  and  pride  in  our  natural
heritage; and the unlocking of the full potential of a better life  for  all
our people. These objectives deserve our appreciation and applause.

It is reassuring to know  that,  in  terms  of  the  National  Environmental
Management Act of  1998,  environmental  impact  assessments  are  not  only
needed,  but  insisted  upon,  before  the   construction,   upgrading   and
development of cableways, electricity power stations and  nuclear  reactors;
roads, airfields, railways, marinas and harbours;  canals,  channels,  dams,
weirs, reservoirs and bulk water supply  schemes;  sewage  treatment  plants
and refuse  disposal  sites;  and  public  and  private  resorts,  including
rezoning and changes in land use.

It is also reassuring to know that we  have  officials  and  elected  public
representatives who do not hesitate and are indeed prepared to stand up  and
strictly  enforce  and  apply  these  environmental  protection  instruments
against  structures  erected  and  constructed  in  the  name  of  so-called
development, like the recent well-publicised case in the Tygerberg.

The Minister also assures us  that  the  department  will  not  hesitate  to
legally pursue and order the tearing down of  illegal  structures  and  will
insist on the rehabilitation of the  land  to  its  previous  state.  It  is
reassuring also in the sense that, with these measures in place, we  can  at
least sleep with one eye closed.

Soos met enige saak, is daar sekere aspekte  in  die  werksaamhede  van  die
departement wat kritiek verdien. Ek verwys spesifiek na  die  hantering  van
die sake van die Nasionale Krugerwildtuin. Agb lede moet my verskoon  as  ek
my kritiek baseer op inligting wat ek uit die pers moes kry,  aangesien  die
Parkeraad se beamptes dit blykbaar  nie  nodig  genoeg  gevind  het  om  die
Gekose Komitee oor Omgewingsake eerstehands in te lig nie.

Bewerings word gemaak van korrupsie, afdankings, swak  administrasie  en  'n
grootskaalse  verkwisting  van  geld.  Die  hoof  uitvoerende  beampte   het
byvoorbeeld onlangs teenoor ons erken dat hy nie  toegang  tot  die  dienste
van 'n finansiële amptenaar het nie en dat hy een oggend wakker  geword  het
met die skokkende ontdekking dat die Nasionale Parkeraad finansieel  in  die
rooi is.

Is  dié  aspek  intussen  al  reggestel  of  word  daar  nog  in  finansiële
duisternis rondgetas? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Like with every issue, there are certain aspects in the functioning of  the
department that deserve criticism. I refer specifically to the  handling  of
the issues relating to the Kruger National Park. Hon members  should  excuse
me if I base my criticism on information which I had to get from the  press,
because officials of the  Parks  Board  did  not  see  their  way  clear  to
informing the Select Committee on  Environmental  Affairs  on  a  first-hand
basis.

Allegations  of  fraud,  dismissals,  poor  administration   and   extensive
squandering of money  are  being  made.  The  chief  executive  officer  for
instance admitted to  us  recently  that  he  does  not  have  access  to  a
financial officer and that he awoke one morning and  came  to  the  shocking
realisation that the National Parks Board was financially in the red.

Has this aspect been rectified in the meantime or are they still groping  in
the financial darkness?]

According to the Sunday Times, antipoaching units and research  projects  at
the Kruger National Park are under threat as the park's workforce  is  being
reduced by 33%. It is furthermore reported that unions have warned that:


  ... conditions at the  park  have  deteriorated,  with  camps  dirty  and
  toilets broken ahead of the winter holiday season.


  The warning comes as  the  park  faces  growing  financial  problems  and
  declining visitor figures.
The Minister might wish to react to these allegations which have  been  made
in the press in view of the fact that the National Parks Board has,  despite
several requests to do so, not seen its way open to enlightening the  select
committee of this House on a first-hand basis.

In conclusion, I would like to propose that the title  of  ``chief  honorary
marine conservation officer'' be conferred on the  Minister  in  recognition
for his commendable management of the Department  of  Environmental  Affairs
and Tourism.

Mrs Z T SEBEKEDI (North West): Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members  of
this august House, allow me to  reiterate  the  point  that  the  Government
budget is a policy implementing tool.

People need to understand that this specific Budget  Vote  has  the  primary
purpose of facilitating and implementing  policies,  plans  and  legislation
that  will  lead  the  tourism  industry  towards  delivering   growth   and
prosperity  to  all  South  Africans  while  ensuring  the  responsible  and
sustainable utilisation of natural and cultural  resources.  The  department
should co-ordinate and liaise  with  provincial  governments  regarding  all
aspects of tourism development.

Tourism is a highly complex industry characterised  by  a  huge  variety  of
heterogeneous role-players, stakeholders and  beneficiaries  who  differ  in
their organisation,  style,  functions  and  objectives.  This  necessitates
close collaboration between the public  and  private  sector  and  organised
civil society, which local government is an integral part  of.  It  is  thus
necessary to identify component parts of this complicated industry in  order
to effectively manage it and understand the optimum role that each  one  has
to play.

A  lack  of  understanding  of  market  profiles  and  behavioural  patterns
provides  the  inherent  danger  of  allocating  resources  and  efforts  to
unsustainable markets and product development strategies.

The North West is cognisant of the available opportunity offered by  tourism
and has identified the requirement  for  market  intelligence  that  informs
appropriate market and product development  strategies.  As  people's  needs
and desires change over time, it is also  important  to  alter  and  develop
products according to changes in market demand, especially when it comes  to
placing the focus on the domestic market, which has a potential to act as  a
buffer  to  counter  the  inevitable  and  unpredictable   fluctuations   in
international tourism.

Our Constitution clearly provides for the functioning of local  tourism  and
beaches, amusement facilities and municipal parks and recreation, which  are
functions associated with tourism, but fall under local authorities.

This highlights the need for close co-operation in  this  respect.  National
and provincial tourism strategies  should  be  closely  aligned  with  local
tourism activities for the sake of co-operative governance. The  opportunity
exists for municipalities to create  revenue-generating  activities  through
tourism projects.

But  the  newly  demarcated  areas  of  jurisdiction  place  an   additional
financial burden on municipalities as they have to administer larger  areas,
including rural areas within their areas of jurisdiction, and all  potential
revenue-generating sources are explored at local level.

So could Big Brother - I mean our department here - and  sister  departments
at provincial level please be so kind as to give support  to  municipalities
that have marketing strategies aimed at introducing  their  local  areas  to
potential tourists and investors?

Municipalities are in the remarkable  position  of  being  able  to  have  a
direct impact on the local economy  as  they  have  a  resource  base  large
enough to plan and  implement  positive  economic  interventions,  including
tourism promotion.

When it comes to environmental affairs,  our  concerns  are  about  existing
legislation regarding waste management in  South  Africa.  It  is  generally
fragmented, diverse and ineffectively administered. The  responsibility  for
executing waste management functions and  the  enforcement  of  the  current
waste-related legislation are not always clear as they  are  spread  over  a
number of national, provincial and local government departments.

This unsatisfactory situation is compounded by the fact that the  definition
of ``waste'', for the purposes of environmental  conservation,  specifically
excludes  radioactive,  mining  and  power  plant  waste.  This  should   be
corrected in the Environment Conservation Act. The  co-ordinated  management
of these waste streams  is  an  area  of  particular  concern  and  requires
detailed  attention,   especially   regarding   institutional   issues   and
integrating and consolidating current permit requirements.

The impact of poor waste management, conditions and practices on the  health
of people living in our rural areas is significant in terms of  the  quality
of life and the education and development opportunities of our communities.

The lack of or inadequately maintained or inappropriately  designed  systems
constitutes a range of pollution risks to  the  environment  and  there  are
quite a number of places  in  the  North  West  that  need  to  be  urgently
attended to in this regard.

I commend this department, under  the  able  leadership  of  Minister  Valli
Moosa, for the progress that it has made in its  transformation  process.  I
wish them good luck and success in all their  endeavours  to  achieve  their
objectives.

We support the approval of this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Dankie, Voorsitter. [Thank you, Chairperson.]

The theme of the Minister's Budget Vote on 29 May, as it is today, was  that
we must act while we can. Since the Minister  delivered  his  speech  on  29
May, two very important things have happened.

First, on 16 June South  Africa  became  the  first  associate  member  from
outside Europe to have  Blue  Flag  accreditation.  In  the  Minister's  own
words: ``This strong commitment from national  Government  is  important  as
Blue Flag is regarded as a national flagship towards the  implementation  of
the White Paper for sustainable coastal development.''

Secondly, at the beginning of this month, we had our Coast Care  Environment
Week celebration. However, there is one  coastal  town  on  the  West  Coast
which has no reason for  celebration,  because  of  severe  erosion  of  its
beach. The relic coastline indicates that if the status quo exists, the  sea
would take about half of the town. This town is  Langebaan,  a  Ramsar  site
and part of the newly proposed West Coast biosphere  reserve,  and  thus  of
enormous international importance. As a Ramsar  site,  the  lagoon  supports
dense populations of molluscs and crustaceans, as  well  as  71  species  of
marine algae.

The lagoon is also the nursery for the  development  of  juvenile  fish  and
gobies, klipfish, pipefish, skates, rays  and  small  sharks,  including  15
regular Palaearctic migrants. The extensive intertidal area  of  the  lagoon
supports up to 55 000 water birds in summer, most of  which  are  waders.  I
think there are approximately 23 species. There are a number of  significant
economic activities in the bay that are directly dependent on the  wellbeing
of the lagoon system,  notably  the  Langebaan  community,  the  West  Coast
National Park, mariculture activities, Mykonos, the navy,  and  the  special
forces.

Langebaan plays host to significant recreational and tourist  facilities  on
the West Coat. The northern beach, which has been the focus of the  erosion,
is an internationally renowned  launching  area  for  windsurfing  and  kite
surfing,  activities  which  attract  tourists,  mainly  from  Europe,   who
consider Langebaan to be one of the world's best windsurfing sites.
Ek wil vinnig 'n bietjie agtergrond gee van die situasie. In  1960  was  die
strandwydte van die Langebaan-strandmeer 160 m. Dertig jaar  later  was  die
wydte presies die helfte minder, naamlik 80 m. Die tempo van erosie het  met
die jare dramaties begin versnel, en in so 'n mate dat die 80 m wat oor  was
in die laaste sewe jaar verdwyn het. Erger nog is  dat  feitlik  die  helfte
van hierdie 80 m sedert 1994 verdwyn het.

Die erodering veroorsaak nou weer 'n opbou van sand in ander  gedeeltes  van
die strandmeer wat tot nadeel strek van die ekologie deurdat  getykanale  se
natuurlike vloei geaffekteer word. Genoemde faktore was dan ook die  oorsaak
dat 'n rotsmuur as 'n tydelike noodoplossing gebou is om  die  dorp  van  'n
ramp te red, want 75% van Langebaan-Noord lê 1 m bo  seespieël  en  50%  van
Langebaan se strandfront - huise en erwe - is dus in onmiddellike gevaar.

Verlede jaar is die rotsmuur met 'n verdere 260 m  verleng,  maar  nou  vind
erosie ook onder die see-oppervlakte plaas en bedreig dit die toon  van  die
rotsmuur deurdat 'n 3 m-sloep voor die  muur  gevorm  het  wat  die  vooroor
ineenstorting van die rotsmuur tot gevolg kan hê. (Translation of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[I quickly want to give some background on the situation. In 1960 the  beach
width of the Langebaan lagoon was 160m. Thirty years later the width of  the
lagoon was exactly half of  that,  namely  80m.  The  rate  of  erosion  had
started to accelerate dramatically through the years and to such  an  extent
that the 80m that was left totally vanished over the last seven years.  Even
worse is the fact that almost half of this 80m has vanished since 1994.

The erosion now creates a build-up of sand in  other  parts  of  the  lagoon
that is to the detriment of the ecology because some of the tidal  channels'
natural flow has been affected. The said factors were the reason why a  rock
wall has been built as a temporary emergency measure to save the  town  from
a disaster, because 75% of Langebaan-North is 1m above sea level and 50%  of
Langebaan's beachfront - houses and plots - were thus in immediate danger.
Last year the rock wall was lengthened by a further 260m,  but  now  erosion
is also taking place underneath the sea surface and it  is  threatening  the
base of the rock wall because a 3m gully has formed in  front  of  the  rock
wall which can result in a forward collapse of the wall.]

I would like to say to the Minister that we  must  act  while  we  can.  The
exact reasons for severe beach erosion are unknown.  However,  a  number  of
factors,  some  anthropogenic  and  some  natural,  are  thought   to   have
contributed to this problem. For example, the  above-average  occurrence  of
high-intensity northwest winds  during  winter,  changes  in  the  size  and
position of the sandbanks south of Skaapeiland, changes in the shape of  the
channel carrying the ebb tide from the lagoon between  Skaapeiland  and  the
mainland, the repositioning of the sand shoal to a more southerly  location,
thereby preventing the natural recycling of sediment, which could  replenish
the beach, past dredging of sand northwest  of  Skaapeiland  during  1975-76
and activities at the Saldanha Bay port  may  have  influenced  the  broader
Saldanha Bay system. But what has been done?

The coastal engineers  were  tasked  with  investigating  a  more  permanent
solution presented in an interim report in 1999. In  March  2000  the  local
authority commissioned a scoping study to identify the long-term  options  -
those presented by coastal engineers and other stakeholders.

Part of this process was a specialist workshop to assess the  situation  and
consider proposals. This workshop was held on 9 to 11 May and  was  attended
by local and international specialists - specialists with  local  knowledge,
with international experience  in  sediment  transport  models  and  in  the
construction of groynes; and experts like Dr Ida Broker  from  Denmark,  who
is the head of the coastal engineering department of  the  Danish  Hydraulic
Institute, and Prof  Christopher  Flemming,  an  internationally  recognised
expert in coastal engineering and coastal management.

It is important to note that  the  natural  equilibrium  of  the  beach  has
changed dramatically, and the proposal from the  experts  is  to  work  with
nature and to realign the beach. For  the  first  time  there  is  consensus
between local and international experts, which is  supported  by  the  local
community, on the way that the beach should be restored.

There is also sufficient precedent to show that a  groyne  is  effective  in
creating a pocket beach - that is,  putting  the  sand  back  through  water
movement and trapping it there.  Judging  by  international  experience  and
studies to  date,  there  are  very  few,  if  any,  negatives.  It  can  be
aesthetically pleasing and a tourist attraction, like the old pier  in  Cape
Town and the jetty in the Strand.

To end off, the permanent solution will cost approximately R20 million.  The
critical need is to protect the existing infrastructure - houses, roads  and
storm-water services - and  to  ensure  that  the  revetment  is  adequately
maintained to provide protection for this  winter.  The  proposed  permanent
solutions should be started with immediately.  Through  different  agencies,
for example local government, the National Disaster Fund and the  Department
of Environmental Affairs and  Tourism  -  the  Coast  Care  fund  which  the
Minister has just mentioned - we should be  able  to  save  Langebaan.  Only
when it is seen to be the concern of Government can  one  look  for  outside
funding.

I am sure the Minister would agree with me that  the  problem  is  obviously
far greater than a local authority or  province  can  be  expected  to  cope
with. Already an amount of R4,8  million  has  been  spent  that  could  and
should have been  channelled  into  projects  for  growth.  I  am  sure  the
Minister will also agree with me that there is a need  to  ensure  that  the
integrity of an internationally protected Ramsar  site  is  not  compromised
and that we must act while we can, before it is too late. [Applause.]

follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon Minister of  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism and the House at large, this is a good  day  since  we  are  talking
about nature, something that God has given us. It always depends on  us  how
we realise, celebrate and protect this beauty so that  it  cannot  disappear
and be damaged and even become nothing but rubbish that one  will  not  want
to look at.

Let us take a look at the provinces that are known for  the  beauty  of  our
nature. The Western Cape is known for  Table  Mountain  and  grapes  out  of
which wine is made. It is also known for having a point at which two  oceans
join. It is known for Robben Island and many other things you can think  of.
All these things need a lot of money to protect and keep  them  at  a  level
that will attract tourists.

The KwaZulu-Natal province is known for its forests, sugar cane,  the  ocean
that moves along the coast  and  many  kinds  of  fruit.  This  province  is
completely green. This is what attracts people, reared and wild  animals.  A
green land is beautiful. All provinces have a history  about  their  nature.
Some are known for their strongholds, historical rocks, popular  trees,  and
I do not know what else to add. In the name  of  the  IFP,  this  department
needs money that will enable it to protect this nature at a level that  will
attract tourists. This department should be given enough funds  so  that  it
will be able to develop the economy.

The KwaZulu-Natal province is known for attracting tourist  because  of  its
beauty. Since it is grouped under poor provinces, this means that  there  is
an economy that will grow if we put more  money  into  it  and  nurture  the
nature that we have.]
Chairperson, hon Minister and members of  Parliament,  South  Africa  enjoys
the highest level of  biodiversity  in  the  world.  Our  parks,  mountains,
rivers, wetlands, wild animals and flowers and the 15  000  rock  art  sites
that we have inherited are our pride and the property of the generations  to
come.

From the economic point of  view,  its  value  is  beyond  calculation.  Our
country's rich heritage is vast  and  staggering  in  its  proportions.  For
example, over 3 700 species occur in South Africa and nowhere  else  in  the
world. The Cape floral region is so unique that it has  been  designated  as
one of the six kingdoms. No other  country  is  host  to  the  entire  plant
kingdom.

Tourism, more than any other sector of the economy, holds the  potential  to
create jobs and stimulate economic growth. The growing demand  for  cultural
tourism provides the opportunity to reclaim our proud  history  and  promote
nation-building and renaissance.

In conclusion, the IFP extends its gratitude to the Minister and members  of
his department for the professional and dedicated work that they  have  done
so far in this field. I also wish to  take  this  opportunity  to  call  all
members of this House to join the Department of  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism in the rewarding campaign to  protect  and  restore  South  Africa's
proud natural heritage. I urge all hon members, for the sake of the  tourism
industry and for their own sakes, to  take  a  long  and  extended  holiday.
[Applause.]

Mr G C ADAMS (Western  Cape):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  colleagues  and
members, I am going to stop short of actually agreeing with my colleague  to
giving the hon the Minister an honorary award. Nevertheless,  I  think  that
he has done a fine job so far.

I would like to tell the hon the Minister that we are now seven  years  into
the miracle birth of a new nation.  It  may  not  have  been  an  immaculate
conception, but a miracle birth it was. Seven  years  after  democracy,  the
prevailing and inescapable dynamic that confronts  the  national  Government
is its failure  to  deliver  to  the  most  marginalised  and  disadvantaged
communities. Failure to deliver to the people is what  is  driving  politics
today. We continue to hear of pensioners dying in queues; fisher folk  in  a
poor and desperate situation trying to make a living from the  sea;  budgets
in key delivery portfolios underspent; wide-scale corruption, and so on.

Whilst other ministerial portfolios  have  done  much  worse,  Environmental
Affairs and  Tourism  has  done  relatively  well,  but  should  not  escape
criticism. Whilst I congratulate Minister Moosa, who clearly has the  spirit
and energy to succeed, for his  good  ideas  and  determination  in  getting
delivery on the ground, I cannot escape the  conclusion  that  he  has  also
failed the people.

I say this because  very  little  has  changed  for  the  poorest  and  most
marginalised people through the policies of  the  national  department.  The
Minister's policies still do not have the support of the subsistence  fisher
folk who continue to survive on the scraps of the industry. The lot  of  the
subsistence fisher folk has worsened and many can now  no  longer  live  off
the sea. Crime and urbanisation are their only refuge. We, in the  province,
unfortunately have to pick up the  tab  in  the  form  of  increased  social
spending.

In his speech in the  National  Assembly,  the  Minister  quoted  Kurlansky,
Huxley and  others.  Once  again,  one  hears  these  erudite  philosophical
writers talking about the lot of the  ordinary  people  of  whom  they  know
nothing and never have known anything.  He  should  forget  about  what  the
philosophers and social commentators tell him  and  go  and  listen  to  the
fisher folk. He should go and see what life is like for them. He  should  go
up to the west coast, small rural villages and hamlets  and  listen  to  the
people, and not listen to Huxley,  who  tells  him  not  to  listen  to  the
people.

I would like to tell the hon the Minister that nobody is suggesting that  we
can fish our way out of poverty  or  that  the  resource  is  limitless.  We
indeed applaud him and his department for protecting the fish resources  and
any increase in  the  total  allowable  catch.  To  achieve  this  we  must,
obviously, eliminate poaching. In the light of the events of the past  week,
we must congratulate the Minister on tackling not only  the  small  poachers
through Operation Neptune, but also the big poachers who, under  the  mantle
of respectable business, deplete our resources by the ton. The raids by  the
Scorpions  confirm  a  long-held  suspicion  that  the  established  fishing
industry is as culpable of poaching as the petty criminal. I would  like  to
tell the hon the Minister that we are behind him in his efforts to clean  up
the industry.

In his budget speech, the Minister boasted that 50% of the rights issued  in
the pelagic sector are now black-owned. Without going into the integrity  of
that figure by stripping out the paper quotas, the front companies  and  the
shameful fraud that is being perpetrated in the name of  ``black-owned'',  I
would like to ask the hon the Minister  how  much  of  that  50%  represents
transformation for the really poor and marginalised; and then  how  much  of
the 50%  represents  patronage  for  the  party  faithful.  In  effect,  the
Minister's policies have advantaged those who have access to capital in  one
form or another. Transformation must be transformation for  the  benefit  of
the poorest and most marginalised and not based on race tags, all  the  more
so in that the  integrity  of  the  transformation  is,  in  any  event,  in
question because of patronage.

Ecotourism presents magnificent opportunities for our communities. I am  not
talking about the kind of tourism that  turns  our  townships  and  villages
into large open-air zoos, but genuine ecotourism which is authentic  in  its
experience and empowering to our people. This is an  alternative  to  trying
to fish our way out of  the  problems  of  poverty.  We  urge  the  hon  the
Minister to aggressively promote this sector as well as expand  the  Working
for the Coastline initiative.

I must also commend the Minister on his  conservation  efforts  for  natural
areas. He has good ideas and has made concerted efforts to  ensure  that  we
comply with our obligations,  nationally  and  internationally.  There  are,
however, still  fundamental  problems  in  this  area.  Highly  questionable
developments are still proceeding because of several  uncertainties  in  our
law. Firstly, we must, as a matter of  priority,  ensure  that  law  reform,
and,  in  particular,   amendments   and   regulations   to   the   National
Environmental Management Act are promulgated. With the conflict of laws  and
uncertainty as to what the law is we, in the province, are  being  litigated
against by both developers and conservationists. It is  a  no-win  situation
that benefits nobody. I would like to ask the hon  the  Minister  to  please
expedite the process of giving us a clear legal framework.

Secondly, as Minister Moosa well knows, Koeberg  in  the  Western  Cape  has
been identified as the preferred site ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, let me start off by saying that I see that  we
have little gifts here today. I do not know what this is, but it looks  like
Mother Earth. If one looks at the gemstones here, they  look  like  tiger's-
eye, and I think  that  tiger's-eye  comes  from  the  Northern  Cape  as  a
province. [Applause.]

The  national  objectives  of  job  creation,   economic   growth,   poverty
alleviation  and  development  are  the  guiding  principles  informing  the
policies and programmes of the Northern Cape department of economic  affairs
and tourism. Tourism in the province is therefore used to achieve the  above
objectives.  This  is  done  by   focusing   on   tourism   investment   and
infrastructure in the underprivileged areas where tourism potential aims  to
empower previously neglected communities.

Given the important contribution which tourism can  make  in  achieving  our
development  objectives,  it  is  essential  that  we  create  the  kind  of
conditions, in  our  province,  which  will  ensure  a  thriving  provincial
tourism industry.

As a first step, we have critically reviewed the role of the  Northern  Cape
Tourism Authority and came to the conclusion that its prime  focus  must  be
to promote and market the province as a tourist destination, whilst  tourism
development should be the  responsibility  of  the  department  of  economic
affairs and tourism.

Secondly, we have identified a number of  issues  that  need  immediate  and
ongoing  attention  to  support  and  enhance  tourism  development  in  the
province, such as community tourism  development,  a  proper  communications
strategy, closer co-operation with the national Department of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism, and closer co-operation with the private sector.

Community tourism development has been  identified  as  one  of  the  growth
sectors of our province which need focused  attention  and  assistance.  The
provincial department has already engaged local  tourism  entrepreneurs  and
is assisting  them  in  developing  their  tourism  products.  An  excellent
example of this is the Didimalang luxury guesthouse in Galeshewe.

A peculiar problem experienced in  this  province  is  the  negative  impact
which  newspapers  such  as  the  Diamond  Fields  Advertiser  have  on  the
development of tourism in our province.

This problem has  highlighted  the  need  for  an  effective  communications
strategy to combat the negative impact on  local  thinking  which  is  often
fuelled by our local newspapers. The provincial department is  currently  in
discussions with the Northern Cape Tourism  Authority  to  set  up  a  joint
communication process to change negative  attitudes  and  promote  unity  of
purpose.

In  terms  of  closer  co-operation  between  the  provincial  and  national
departments, the province hopes to enlist national support for  partnerships
that will seek to further develop the province as a tourist destination.

At the same time the provincial department is engaging the  private  sector,
most notably De Beers, to venture into a partnership  agreement  jointly  to
develop the Big Hole, which is one of the major tourist attractions  in  the
province,  as  well  in  South  Africa.  The  above   are   all   short-term
interventions which the provincial department hopes  to  accomplish  in  the
next one to two years.

The department of economic affairs and tourism has also developed  a  number
of medium  and  long-term  strategies  around  tourism  development  in  the
province. As a medium-term strategy, the department will  create  a  genuine
nodal attraction at Kimberley which will provide the province with  a  solid
kick-start for new tourism.

The department will also establish a  tourism  empowerment  fund  that  will
give focus to empowerment  through  a  community-public-private  partnership
approach   and   provide   support   to   ensure   access   to   appropriate
entrepreneurial financial support linked with national  incentives  as  they
unfold.

The department will also create links with the SA  National  Parks.  Through
this link the department  hopes  to  play  a  role  in  the  development  of
national parks in the region so as to maximise  downstreaming  business  and
employment opportunities for the people in the Northern Cape.

The Northern Cape Tourism Authority  will  also  build  networks  with  tour
operators,  travel  agents,  airline  and  hotel  groups  both  locally  and
internationally, and use these networks to drive its own  tourism  promotion
and marketing process.

Given the fact that the Northern Cape is not  a  final  destination,  it  is
important to create or develop existing packages for travel in the  province
and to market these through the networks. This will boost  the  service  and
hospitality industries in our province significantly.

The long-term interventions will no doubt begin to define themselves as  the
outcome of growth in the local industry. It is, however,  likely  that  this
will be guided by the so-called megatrends of tourism.

It is important to reiterate that this exercise needs to be supplemented  in
order to secure unity of purpose as to the  way  forward  for  the  Northern
Cape. As a result, the main long-term intervention should be to support  the
further  planning  and  implementation  of  specific   tourism   development
opportunities as identified for each subregion.

All  of  these  projects  are   of   such   significance   that   commercial
opportunities for the development of new tourism products  are  anticipated.
More  importantly,  given  our  aspirations  for  small,  medium  and  micro
enterprise development, a number of these  projects  look  likely  to  offer
opportunities for community-based tourism initiatives.

We in the Northern Cape are therefore in support of the Budget Vote for  the
Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism. If someone is  in  need  of
some fresh air and quietness, he or she should come  to  the  Northern  Cape
province. We have a slogan that says: Follow the sun and not the crowds  and
you will end up in the Northern Cape. [Applause.]

Mr M M MACKENZIE (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, let me first acknowledge  the
very positive steps that are being taken by the Minister to ensure that  our
environment in its totality is preserved for posterity,  so  that  the  main
user,  tourism,  is  assured  of  a  well-managed   biodiversity   for   the
consumption of visitors.

Let me concentrate my limited time on an area  which  has  not  yet  reached
problem status, but will soon do so if we  do  not  act,  and  that  is  the
recognition of the vulnerability of our parks and  protected  areas  in  all
provinces to the lack of sustainable policy in  regard  to  the  land  areas
immediately adjacent to our parks and protected areas.

It is an inescapable fact that  historically  local  people  were  alienated
from their land in order to establish parks. This has resulted in many  land
claims over parks and protected areas. It is now necessary to find means  of
rectifying these socioeconomic imbalances caused by the  creation  of  parks
and protected areas. Local people have been denied access  to  the  material
benefits which flow from parks. The multiplier effect from tourism in  these
neighbouring disadvantaged communities  has  been  almost  nonexistent,  and
this has  resulted  in  the  management  and  operations  within  the  parks
becoming seriously  problematic,  in  a  socially  and  politically  hostile
environment.

Many parks and protected areas in developing  countries  are  notorious  for
the  antagonisms  that  exist  between  the  management  agencies  and   the
neighbouring  communities.  The  friction  usually  results   from   illegal
utilisation of  wildlife  resources  exacerbated  by  a  history  of  forced
removals or land utilisation; crop or livestock losses from  herbivores  and
large predators; poverty  on  the  outside  versus  perceived  opulence  and
plenty for tourists and officials inside the fence; the nonaccessibility  of
arks  and  protected  areas  and  their  amenities  and  benefits  for  poor
communities; and perceptions among poor communities that  only  the  wealthy
benefit.

The IUCN  recognises  that  parks  and  protected  areas  are  ecologically,
economically, politically and culturally linked to the  areas  around  them,
and therefore buffer zones are becoming an accepted norm internationally  in
both the developed and the developing world. This is  to  reduce  the  hard-
edge effect  of  protected  areas  bordering  on  community  land.  Conflict
between protected areas and  local  people  is  therefore  an  international
phenomenon, but here it is aggravated by the political past.  The  challenge
therefore is to develop a home-grown model based on local circumstances  and
opportunities that will immediately improve relations and result in  a  win-
win situation for both parties.

A proposed strategy exists and is well articulated by Mr  Hector  Magome  of
SA National Parks, who has been liberally quoted in this speech of mine.  It
is therefore viewed as essential that the Minister  avail  himself  of  this
document.

There  are  risks  involved  and  these  can  only  be  overcome  with   the
intelligent use of  available  expertise.  These  risks  are:  inappropriate
communication caused by heightened expectations; bureaucratic and  political
constraints and inadequate advance planning; a lack of detailed and  patient
explanation  and  a  lack  of  internal  park  personnel  support  for   the
recognition and the incorporation of this philosophy.

The success of the whole process will follow the correct application of  the
principle of inclusion as opposed to exclusion, with  the  concomitant  flow
of revenues to the hitherto disadvantaged people. Conservation can  survive,
but only if people realise that to serve it correctly, all life needs to  be
nurtured.

[I have noticed that here in the southern part of  the  country  members  of
Parliament eat fish. Where I come from people eat meat. What we  are  saying
is, if members of Parliament like meat, they should visit us. We will  roast
intibane [warthog] meat for them. It is so delicious! [Laughter.]]

Mr K D S DURR:  Chairperson,  I  wish  to  speak  to  the  Minister  and  in
particular address the acquisition of land for  SA  National  Parks  in  the
Western Cape. I am speaking now of the West Coast National Park. I  wish  to
raise the matter of a farm called Langefontein,  which  is  a  few  thousand
hectares in extent. This tract of land is currently owned by the  Department
of Defence, but is superfluous to their requirements, and the  ownership  of
the land is currently under review.

SA National Parks, whose land to the north of the mentioned  land,  east  of
the R27, is contiguous with Langefontein, has  applied  for  the  land,  but
there are other competing interests. However, the land  is  central  to  the
long-term expansion plans of  SA  National  Parks  that  can  only  be  very
limited, because the area is highly developed, and  will  protect  the  West
Coast biosphere. The land can be transferred to  SA  National  Parks  at  no
cost, because it already belongs to the Government.
The hon the Minister would know that only 1% of West Coast fynbos  is  left.
The rest has gone to the plough, to development or to alien vegetation.  The
Langefontein land in question is one of the  last  opportunities  the  state
has to increase the size and the viability of the West Coast  National  Park
and to expand the biodiversity under its span of control. We  are  the  last
generation,  as  the  Minister  correctly  says,  who   might   have   these
opportunities. Since Langefontein  lies  to  the  east  of  the  West  Coast
National Park, it has slightly better soils and hills,  different  botanical
species and a slightly higher rainfall, and thus would add  to  the  limited
opportunity we have for adding to the biodiversity of the  park,  since  the
principle reasons why that park has been established are ornithological  and
botanical in nature.

The land has extremely  low  agricultural  potential,  but  it  is  rich  in
botanical species even at its present size. Competing interests  that  would
lead to the subdivision of the land would condemn  new  owners  to  poverty.
The land can only be grazed by domestic animals for about three  months  per
year and is not arable. So, even at its present size  it  is  an  uneconomic
unit, and to subdivide it into smaller units would simply be condemning  any
future owners to a life of poverty. The land would provide  the  opportunity
to increase rare botanical biodiversity and to reintroduce rare  species  of
animals.

The land also adjoins Elandsfontein. That is the second  reason  why  it  is
important to acquire this land. It  is  the  last  remaining  land  that  is
extensive and contiguous with the park  and  that  possibly  could  ever  be
integrated into that park. Also, one of those farms, Elandsfontein, has  the
second oldest human remains in Africa, after  Sterkfontein,  and  there  the
University of Cape Town has a permanent dig, an archeological site which  is
of considerable interest and which could add hugely, at  some  future  time,
to the enrichment of the park  as  a  whole.  This  area  has  high  tourism
potential and therefore would create  employment  and  make  the  park  more
viable, because it will attract more people. Thus the eastern side would  be
more commercially viable.
The  SA  National  Parks  application  is  supported  by  the  Western  Cape
conservation authorities, the Western Cape government  and  conservationists
worldwide. There is considerable interest from around the world and  I  also
hosted World Wildlife Fund people here the other day.  I  ask  the  Minister
not to let the opportunity slip and I do not think he will. I would like  to
quote the hon the Minister, who  recently  said,  ``We  must  act  while  we
can.'' There are very few opportunities left  in  that  area,  and  none  so
attractive for conservation.

The hon the Minister would know that the park cannot expand  to  the  north.
Langebaan  lies  to  the  north.  It  also  cannot  expand  to  the   south.
Ysterfontein lies to the south. It can only expand  to  the  east,  and  the
area to the east is almost arable, so conservation  opportunities  are  very
limited, and we are the last generation to have a chance to do something  in
that super-sensitive, rare and fragile part of the world. I  would  like  to
say to the hon the Minister that the matter has been dragging on for  months
if not years, and everybody would like a  settlement  and  finality  to  the
situation so  that  they  can  get  on  with  the  task  of  conserving  and
developing that land and its tourism potential. [Time expired.]

Ms Y M  NAHARA  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Madam  Chair,  I  would  firstly  like  to
congratulate Minister Valli Moosa and his  departmental  officials  for  the
good work and the explanations  they  gave  us  and  for  their  efforts  in
producing a budget document for such a diverse Ministry. Those who  were  in
the select committee would understand  what  I  mean.  This  Budget  speech,
delivered by the Minister today, will be  regarded  in  KwaZulu-Natal  as  a
document, not just a speech, because it comes at a time when the  department
of environmental  affairs  and  tourism  in  KwaZulu-Natal  and  the  nature
conservation services are busy working on the restructuring of the NCS,  the
intention being to improve on the  management  of  our  nature  conservation
reserves and also to improve the standard of services that will attract  our
visitors when they come to KwaZulu-Natal.

The increase in  this  Budget  signals  to  us  greater  commitment  by  the
Minister in ensuring that we deliver  quality  services  in  our  respective
provinces. In  our  province,  for  instance,  with  its  diverse  and  rich
coastline, we are particularly pleased to  hear  that  an  amount  of  R42,5
million has been set aside  for  the  environment  and  the  development  of
spatial developmental initiatives along the East Coast.

We are also encouraged by the increase for environmental  and  planning  co-
ordination and marine and coastal development. I want to place  emphasis  on
planning and co-ordination, and hope that co-ordination  between  provincial
and local government sectors  will  be  addressed  so  that  the  roles  and
responsibilities of these bodies are clear.

When one looks at townships and  poor  rural  areas,  on  the  environmental
side, what one sees there is really discouraging, especially  when  we  have
been in government for seven years. We  still  have  poor  people  who  live
under terrible environmental conditions. One is aware of the fact that  some
of these problems are district responsibilities. However,  I  think  if  the
Minister could assist, and emphasise and reprioritise some  of  these  areas
as environmental sites, it would help a lot. It will also  make  the  people
see and understand that we are now living under a new government that  takes
care of all its people. [Applause.]

Mr D SILKE (Western Cape): Madam Chair, it is indeed a pleasure  for  me  to
enter this debate today on the subject  of  tourism.  Tourism  has  so  many
positive spin-offs for all the people of our country that I  really  do  not
have to enumerate its many benefits. Therefore it is a real pleasure for  me
to be here on behalf of the Western Cape's Minister  of  business  promotion
and tourism, Minister Leon Markovitz.

When dealing with tourism from a Western Cape perspective, let me  say  that
any tourist to the Western Cape is also a tourist to South Africa,  and  any
tourist to the rest of South Africa is  also  hopefully  a  tourist  to  the
Western Cape. So I want to talk from an inclusive point  of  view  and  just
highlight my concern about tourism very broadly within South Africa. I  want
to address in my limited time available just one or two specific  issues  of
getting tourists into South Africa, because I  think  that  is  the  crucial
element that we need to discuss.

I want to highlight that one of the most  critical  problems,  I  think,  in
bringing tourists to South Africa, and a problem that is  an  impediment  to
increasing arrival figures at  South  Africa's  international  airports,  is
Government's aviation policy. I do  believe  that  it  is  blocking  tourism
flows to and within South Africa. We need to  ensure  more  competition  and
flight options on our major routings, in particular from the United  Kingdom
to South Africa.

During our high season  flights  are  often  fully  booked  for  weeks,  and
potential visitors are therefore blocked from coming to  South  Africa.  The
United Kingdom comprises more than 20%  of  our  total  foreign  market  and
offers huge scope for further expansion.  It  is  no  use  staging  a  South
Africa Week in London, and directing millions of rands towards marketing  in
the UK and Europe when, in fact, potential visitors cannot even  find  place
on aircrafts flying into South Africa.

I know of many potential visitors who wish  to  visit  our  lovely  country,
particularly during the high season when  they  can  travel.  But,  frankly,
they are simply put off and give  up  trying  to  find  seats  on  aircraft,
because of the very restrictive policies that exist in terms  of  the  major
airlines flying into South Africa. Given the  seasonal  adjustments  in  air
tariffs as well, one cannot help feeling that this protectionist  policy  is
there to protect the major airlines flying into South  Africa,  rather  than
to really encourage those visitors that we so desperately need.

Bold steps are therefore required to channel visitors to  South  Africa.  Of
course, from our perspective, particularly Cape Town, which is a gateway  to
Africa, I might add that I am very pleased that we now have a  new  airport,
and I think that the Airports Company has done a very fine job, and we  want
to use it and see aircraft arriving. Unfortunately, I have to  report  that,
in fact, over the last few months, there has been a decline, rather than  an
increase, in international arrivals in Cape Town.

The London to South Africa route is certainly the big problem  in  terms  of
increase in capacity, especially with the reduction of  flights  from  other
European countries, for example, those flown by Sabena,  from  Belgium,  and
Austrian Airlines. This has created a  limitation  on  the  seats  available
and, in fact, the problem is becoming more and more acute. There  are  fewer
seats coming into South Africa, and very few new flights are  being  allowed
or sanctioned, particularly on these routes. We need a  more  liberal  open-
skies policy, and I really ask  the  Minister  to  address  this  particular
issue.

Whilst most South Africans have noticed a virtual 25% hike in  international
airline fares since April of this year, it is internal air  travel  as  well
that has become exorbitantly expensive, for South African citizens  and  for
visitors as well. SAA has seemingly monopolised this market and the  ongoing
saga surrounding the remuneration package of Mr Coleman  Andrews  makes  one
think that we should  be  making  airline  travel  more  affordable  to  the
majority of South Africans, who would love to  undertake  domestic  holidays
and do business, rather than lining the  pockets  of  chief  executives  and
their cronies in such excessive ways.

For emerging small business entrepreneurs, it is  fast  becoming  impossible
to extend their markets by making vital business trips across  the  country.
Therefore if we are really serious about getting tourism to  flourish  in  a
long-haul  and  geographically  expensive  destination  like  South  Africa,
airline access and affordability are  paramount  and  these  should  receive
prime attention.

Furthermore, SA Tourism, formerly called Satour, has clearly  not  optimised
its mandate  thus  far.  The  organisation  is  currently  without  a  chief
executive officer and has had four CEOs  in  as  many  years.  There  is  no
definitive marketing strategy and no stringent monitoring and  measuring  of
the impact of the huge budget that has been raised in partnership  with  the
Business Trust.
I am really upset when I look at the foreign  tourism  figures  coming  into
South Africa as measured in terms of  average  growth  ...  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr F M MOKWELE (Northern Province): Chairperson, hon members  of  the  NCOP,
hon Minister Valli Moosa, hon members of different  legislatures,  allow  me
this opportunity to express my  profound  appreciation  at  standing  before
this House today as a representative of the Northern Province's  legislature
and its communities.

It is, indeed, a privilege to be entrusted with this mammoth  responsibility
of ensuring that the aspirations of thousands of our people in the  province
towards environmental justice and sustainable tourism  activities  are  made
known to the entire country and its leadership.

It would also be an act of treason if I did not join the  Minister  and  our
colleagues here in saying that today is a great day for us  because  we  are
celebrating the 46th anniversary of the adoption of the Freedom  Charter  as
a guiding document towards the liberation  of  this  country.  However,  the
celebrations are taking place against the backdrop of  great  strides  which
have been made in the betterment of the lives of people in the country,  and
our province in particular.

With,  side  by  side,  the  national,  provincial  and  local  spheres   of
government, in collaboration with various social forces, the  cause  of  our
struggle for liberation shall definitely  triumph,  as  the  late  combatant
Comrade Oliver Tambo said in Durban in 1991.

The Northern Province has, in the past six years, identified tourism as  one
of the key economic sectors with the potential of unlocking the natural  and
cultural resources found  within  its  borders  and  beyond.  The  Warmbaths
summits on growth and development strategy have given more  impetus  to  the
province's self-realisation effort as a means to move out of the bracket  of
being referred to as the poorest province.

The vision of a golden horseshoe  of  tourism  composed  of  countless  game
parks  and  transnational  peace  parks  straddling  the  borders  with  our
neighbours is being realised as an important tourism future for our  present
and future generations. The Government has since also realised that  on  its
own  it  cannot  and  should  not  run  game  parks.  It  was  within   this
understanding and context that Government decided to allow  communities  and
the private sector to run these parks in a more profitable way. The role  of
Government in this particular regard  will  be  that  of  a  facilitator  in
creating the necessary environment.

The Makuleka story is known to us. This is a particularly  good  example  of
community effort to  do  things  for  themselves.  To  this  end,  we  would
appreciate more resources being made available to that particular  community
in order to realise its objectives.

Talking of cultural heritage sites which are in  abundance  and  untamed  in
the Northern Province, the following come to  mind:  Mapungubwe,  Thulamela,
Makapansgat and other sites and artistic works by the San.

The current policy initiatives by hon Minister  Moosa  on  the  peace  parks
need to be commended. It is the hope of the province that,  at  the  end  of
these processes, communities in the Northern  Province  will  be  the  great
benefactors, thus allowing them to move faster on the  economic  development
front.  I  wish  to  also  quote  the  then  Deputy  President  and  current
President, the hon Comrade Thabo Mbeki, on  the  occasion  of  the  economic
development summit in Warmbaths on 26 February 1999, when he said:


  We cannot say that we are moving forward if our poorer provinces are  not
  the ones that are moving forward fastest.


  It is a critical matter, therefore, that this meeting is about. I believe
  that all of us are agreed on this point.

The  tourism  resort  and  gaming  budget  in  our  province  is  a   paltry
R44,612 million. It is within this context that  in  order  to  realise  our
stated objective the Department of Environmental Affairs and  Tourism  needs
to come and assist us.

Concluding this section on tourism, I wish to invite members of this  august
House to join the communities of the Northern  Province  in  their  cultural
renaissance effort. What I am saying here is that  members  are  invited  to
the Northern Province. Members must walk with us on the ivory  route,  which
is unparalleled in the country and elsewhere in the world. We would use  ox-
wagons if available, because of the toughness of the course,  but  they  are
no longer there, so the 4X4s will suffice, and we will be happy  to  provide
them.

The sustainable management and use of our natural resources  is  needed  for
biodiversity purposes  in  terms  of  species  protection,  enhancement  and
ecological systems protection. The management  of  biodiversity  contributes
to  the  conservation  of  our  natural  life-supporting  systems  such   as
wetlands, clean water and air.

In order to achieve  the  above  and  stated  objectives,  the  province  is
developing the provincial biobase and biodiversity  information  system.  It
is further engaged in efforts to undertake biomonitoring  of  river  systems
within  catchment  areas,  develop  conservation  strategies  and  undertake
annual grass monitoring processes in protected  areas,  and  game  reduction
proposals.

The province is currently working  very  hard  on  the  Waterberg  biosphere
area, as all members are aware. We express our appreciation of the  Minister
and the department's support on this particular issue. In full  bloom,  this
initiative  should  see  communities  being   integrated   into   a   modern
conservation area in the beautiful parts of the bushveld.

It should be mentioned here that Nylsvlei has been declared a  Ramsar  site,
making it one of the few declared wetland sites in the world. This site  has
limitless possibilities for conservation and tourist attraction.

While the province wishes to see itself accomplishing  some  of  these  most
important and critical tasks,  the  section  dealing  with  biodiversity  in
particular is currently understaffed, and that is the  greatest  problem  we
have. The situation needs to be corrected.

It  is  the  view  of  the  Northern  Province  that   the   Department   of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism needs to  be  actively  involved  or  make
more resources available to correct this situation. If the situation is  not
corrected or addressed, there is a risk  that  some  of  the  natural  life-
supporting systems will be degraded to a point at which it is impossible  to
manage areas that produce, for instance, clean water.  These  are  catchment
and wetlands areas.

Environmental education is being taken seriously in our  province.  To  this
end, the environmental  section  of  the  department  of  finance,  economic
affairs, environmental affairs and tourism in the province is ensuring  that
environmental  education  is  integrated  into  the  school  curriculum   by
supporting Curriculum 2005 processes, with a view  to  developing  standards
for environment-related qualifications through the  National  Qualifications
Framework.

The  province  wishes  to  commend  the  Minister  for  ensuring  that   the
provisions of Chapter 2,  the  Bill  of  Rights,  of  our  Constitution  are
implemented, particularly  section  24.  This  has  been  done  through  the
enactment, first and foremost, of the National Environmental Management  Act
of 1998. All our legislation could derive much from its provisions.

As already stated, the scarcity of resources needs to be addressed so as  to
ensure that functions such as environmental impact assessment and  pollution
management receive the attention they deserve.

In conclusion, the Northern Province wishes  to  support  the  Vote  of  the
Minister and I do so on behalf of the province. [Applause.]
Mr A E DE WET (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, I am  sure  there  is  nobody  in
this Chamber here today who would not be aware of the Wild  Coast  community
tourism initiative, and for that we thank the hon the Minister.  I  am  sure
he is also reminded of the day when we saw him in the Eastern Cape with  his
scout hat, shorts and boots, walking along the Wild Coast with our hon  MEC.
I must say right at the outset that the hon MEC would dearly have  liked  to
be here today, to deliver his speech  himself,  but  it  is  my  honour  and
privilege to do so on his behalf.

The Department of Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  administers  various
pieces of legislation, and a number  of  concurrent  competencies  exist  in
terms of that legislation. In the Eastern Cape the  department  of  finance,
economic affairs, environment and tourism is the authority  responsible  for
most of these concurrent functions.

The Environmental Conservation Act makes provision for the  conservation  of
biodiversity  in  South  Africa.  This,  inter  alia,   provides   for   the
establishment and management of protected areas, as well as the  sustainable
utilisation of natural resources.

Protected areas management is one of the core functions of the province,  as
well as the department. National protected areas that occur in  the  Eastern
Cape are the Addo Elephant National Park, the Mountain Zebra  National  Park
and the Tsitsikamma Coastal and Marine National Park, and are being  managed
by SA National Parks.

Various joint provincial and  national  initiatives  are,  moreover,  taking
place within the Eastern Cape province. These initiatives are:  the  Greater
Baviaanskloof Project, the Greater  Addo  National  Park  and  the  proposed
Pondoland Park. The imminent incorporation  of  the  Woody  Cape  Provincial
Nature Reserve into the Greater Addo National Park is of specific  relevance
in this regard.

Sustainable resources utilisation is  one  of  the  core  functions  of  the
department. This includes numerous inspections and  site  visits,  protected
flora permits,  a  certificate  of  adequate  enclosure,  capacity  permits,
proposed game introduction, legal and  illegal  gambling,  crop  damage  and
liaison with role-players in the wildlife and tourism industry.

The department, moreover, administers various international  conventions  on
behalf of South  Africa.  Of  specific  relevance  in  this  regard  is  the
Convention for the International Trade  in  Endangered  Species,  Cites,  in
terms of which  the  Eastern  Cape  is  yet  to  be  appointed  as  a  Cites
management authority. At present, all permit applications thus  have  to  be
referred to the Western Cape for approval, and this,  in  a  province  where
the hunting and the trophy industry is booming, is something that  needs  to
be attended to.

The National Environmental Management Act, inter alia, aims to  promote  the
application of  appropriate  environmental  management  tools  in  order  to
ensure the integrated management of activities.  Furthermore,  in  terms  of
the  Act,  each  province  has   to   draft   a   provincial   environmental
implementation plan, and once it  has  been  submitted  to  the  department,
implement it. I wish to state that the Eastern Cape province  has  submitted
a draft EIP to the department.

The EIA regulations seek to manage and  regulate  activities  that,  in  the
opinion of the Minister, may have a significant detrimental  impact  on  the
environment.  It  entails  the  assessment  of  the  impacts   of   proposed
activities on ecosystems, landscapes, habitat and biota.  These  regulations
have been delegated to the province. However, under  certain  circumstances,
as outlined in the regulations, applications still have to  be  referred  to
the department.

In  addition  to  administering  the  EIA  regulations,  the  province  also
provides comments and input to regional and  local  planning  exercises,  as
well as nonlisted developments, such as mining and rezoning applications.

The province has no delegated authority  as  far  as  waste  management  and
pollution  control  are  concerned.  However,  owing  to  the   absence   of
department officials, except  those  with  Marine  and  Coastal  Management,
within the province, the provincial staff normally find themselves  becoming
heavily involved in various issues relating to this function.

These includes  monitoring,  the  inspection  of  pollution  incidences  and
illegal  dumping,  providing  advice  and  support  to  local   authorities,
dissemination of  information  to  the  public,  and,  lastly,  funding  and
assisting with waste-management-related projects.

I now come to the Sea-shore Act. All structures below the  high-water  mark,
including the approval and annual  renewal  of  the  lease  agreements,  are
regulated in terms of this Act. The Act has been delegated in  its  entirety
to the province. However, currently, these structures  are  only  authorised
in terms of the EIA regulations,  while  the  administration  of  leases  in
terms of the Sea-shore Act is yet to be implemented, and we urge that it  be
done.

I now address marine and coastal management. This function is  performed  by
the Department of Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism,  as  stated  in  the
Marine Living Resources Act. The province  has  no  delegated  authority  in
terms of this Act. However, various issues end up being  the  responsibility
of the province.

Most of  the  relevant  provincial  staff  working  in  the  coastal  nature
reserves in the  province  have  undergone  training  as  fisheries  control
officers, but only some have been appointed as such,  by  the  MCM.  In  the
absence of MCM staff in certain areas, specifically noting the  ex-Transkei,
all marine and coastal management  functions  are  being  performed  by  the
province,  without  any  financial  assistance   or   resources   from   the
department.

Furthermore, until clear management arrangements with MCM are in place,  and
as far as the provincial budget allows, only  priority  cases,  normally  of
abalone poaching, are being handled in the  other  areas  of  the  province.
Field rangers do, however, check on marine resources while on patrol  within
reserves, and I must say that there is good co-operation with the local  MCM
staff, if they are present.

With regard to subsistence fishing licences, the process of  awarding  these
licences at the various communities in the Eastern Cape is being dealt  with
by the MCM. MCM  staff  members,  however,  find  it  difficult  to  operate
effectively from Cape Town, and this process  is  beset  with  difficulties.
Upon request from the  MCM,  the  provincial  officials  have  attempted  to
provide assistance, but found the process to be unclear and  confusing.  Not
much has been achieved as far as subsistence licensing is concerned  in  the
province.

The Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism has no  regional  office
in the province. Its limited presence is restricted to  Marine  and  Coastal
Management, MCM,  and  fisheries  control  offices  in  Jeffreys  Bay,  Port
Elizabeth, Port Alfred and  East  London.  All  these  offices  are  totally
understaffed, with the result that there is a huge burden,  especially  with
coastal management issues being referred to the provincial officials.

It is an accepted management principle that delegated  functions  should  be
followed by the adequate provision of budget  and  staff.  It  is  therefore
imperative that a clear management arrangement between  the  department  and
the province be determined  as  a  matter  of  urgency.  These  arrangements
should be put in place  for  those  functions  currently  delegated  to  the
province, as well as prior to any further functions being delegated  to  the
province by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism.

With  regard  to  the  fishing  industry,  it  must  be  stated   that   the
participation of previously disadvantaged persons is still minimal  in  real
terms. The  control  of  the  industry  is  still  vested  in  a  few  large
companies. Our challenge is to alter this situation  in  a  responsible  and
sustainable manner.

It is regrettable to note that for  nearly  the  whole  of  last  year  most
fishers spent more time briefing lawyers and attending to court  proceedings
than catching fish. This is a a  negative  development.  This  is  owing  to
legal action instituted by unsuccessful applicants over  the  allocation  of
hake longline quotas by the department. As a result of  this  legal  action,
only a few quota holders managed to slip through and actually catch fish  in
January 2000. This was the result of them getting their permits  before  the
court proceedings were instituted.

The Eastern Cape has, in the past, been generally  neglected  in  the  wider
development  and  growth  of  the  fishing  sector.  This  has  led  to  the
concentration of the fishing industry in the Western Cape.

Our challenge is to work out a plan that will spread the  benefits  of  this
marine resource along our entire coastline. We are  mindful  that  the  fish
species have no boundaries in the waters.

The deep-water harbour that is being developed at Coega is going to  provide
opportunities for the upgrading and expansion of the fishing  infrastructure
and facilities so as to be able to grow the sector  in  a  more  responsible
manner.

I now come to tourism in the Eastern Cape.  The  key  delivery  outputs  for
this year are the formulation of a provincial tourism development  strategy,
the establishment of a hospitality and tourism school,  familiarisation  and
educational  trips  by   regional   tourism   organisations   and   emerging
disadvantaged businesses, training and trainer programmes,  business  sector
training,  tourism  month,   facilitating   the   participation   of   black
entrepreneurs in the tourism  industry,  developing  a  provincial  heritage
route  map,  multifunctional   sports   arenas   and   providing   community
development support to the EU project for the Wild Coast - again  I  express
appreciation for the bags that we have been given -  the  co-ordination  and
registration of accommodation facilities in the province ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr A E DE WET: I conclude by saying to the Minister that there is  a  belief
in the Eastern Cape that tourism in South  Africa  will  only  succeed  when
tourism in the Wild Coast succeeds. [Applause.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, anybody who knows me in this House knows  that  I
will not pass up an opportunity to respond  to  the  kind  of  cowardly  and
dishonest speech that MEC Adams from the Western Cape made.

I was really amused at the speech that he made, because he said a number  of
things. He said that the Minister of Environmental Affairs and  Tourism  had
failed the people, that he had issued fishing  licenses  for  patronage  for
the party faithful. He  said  that  the  Minister  was  only  interested  in
transformation for the poorest of the poor, that he  was  playing  tag  with
the rest, and so forth.

It is quite a joke hearing comments like that from somebody who  belongs  to
the party that caused the whole debacle in the first place.  I  must  remind
MEC Adams that he governs in a province where 90% of the  fishing  interests
are still controlled by white monopoly companies, and he  is  doing  nothing
about it. I want to remind him that 99% of the  businesses  in  the  tourism
industry, such as at the Waterfront, are in the hands of white people.

In this province where he governs, 99% of restaurants, hotel  rooms  and  so
forth are in the hands of white people. The only thing he understands  about
black economic empowerment and tourism is to bus white people  in  beautiful
luxury buses through Khayelitsha and Bonteheuwel  and  show  them  the  poor
little people of this country. That is what he knows  about  black  economic
empowerment, and then he makes statements like this.

It is shocking. It is absolutely shocking. I think that he needs to get  his
own back yard in order, I have some words for that, but I do not think  they
are appropriate in this honourable House. But I believe he  needs  to  clean
that up before he comes and talks  about  these  kinds  of  things  in  this
House. But I am not going to waste any more time on  that.  I  am  going  to
make my speech.

I think that  this  House  knows  very  well  that  Gauteng  faces  enormous
challenges. I speak today on behalf of Gauteng. Gauteng covers only 1,4%  of
the country's land area and yet  we  sustain  about  20%  of  the  country's
population. We sustain  about  400  persons  per  square  kilometre  in  our
province. In Gauteng we produce more than 40% of the country's GDP  and  yet
we sustain about 70% of the country's workforce.

We experience a population growth much higher  than  most  other  provinces.
Some figures show that between 1970 and 1995 the population of our  province
more than doubled.

What this means is that together we face the challenges of the  high  demand
on natural resources that urbanisation brings in our  province.  It  impacts
on our water and land resources. There is a high  demand  for  services  and
infrastructure, housing,  roads,  waste  collection  services,  recreational
facilities and the management of sewage and, mostly, for the  management  of
employment opportunities.

As a representative of the province  of  Gauteng,  I  want  to  say  to  the
Minister that our province needs firm strategies,  crisis  strategies,  with
regard to two issues, namely waste management and air pollution. I  want  to
raise some of those things.

The Minister said that we, as a country, produce 566 million tons  of  waste
per year. I want  to  indicate  how  much  of  that  waste  comes  from  our
province. We assume that probably about 80% of the country's waste is  being
produced in the little province of Gauteng.

Domestic waste is being produced  at  about  4,3  million  tons  per  annum,
health care waste at about 14 000 tons per annum and hazardous waste,  which
includes the mines and power stations, probably at about  1,8  million  tons
per annum. The biggest producers of waste in our province are the mines  and
power stations, which, together, produce about 370  million  tons  of  waste
per annum, all in the little province of Gauteng.

That demands some serious consideration about what we are to do about  waste
management of a domestic, industrial and effluent nature in the province  of
Gauteng.

I believe that the Ministry of Environmental Affairs and  Tourism  needs  to
embark on very severe strategies in the province of Gauteng  to  manage  its
waste problem. If we can sort out the waste management problem  in  Gauteng,
we will probably have sorted out about 70% of the  waste  disposal  problems
in this country. I think we will probably also be able to put  down  a  good
model for waste management in other provinces.

The Minister is right, our local  authorities  do  not  have  statistics  in
order to deal with this matter. It  is  also  not  clear  whether  the  mere
delivery of dustbins to areas which require these might solve  the  problem.
It calls for a more comprehensive  strategy  around  how  we  are  going  to
recycle waste. What are we going to do about  waste  that  can  be  recycled
into compost and so forth and waste that is  completely  lost,  which  needs
either to be incinerated or to have something else done to it?

I need to bring up another statistic. According  to  statistics,  about  300
million tons of the country's most valuable  topsoil  gets  washed  off  the
land and silts  up  the  rivers  and  dams  each  year.  Maybe  there  is  a
relationship between how we recycle our waste  and  what  we  do  about  the
silting up of our topsoil. I think  something  needs  to  be  done  at  that
level.

Regarding a waste management strategy, the Minister mentioned  providing  an
award or prize for the cleanest and dirtiest towns. It is a  good  idea  and
it might get towns to realise that something can be done. However, I am  not
sure whether that alone is going to address  the  issues  that  need  to  be
addressed. In some areas, like Gauteng, waste management and  air  pollution
are becoming so critical that it will do no good finding one town  that  has
done well and another that has not. We need a holistic, integrated  strategy
with regard to urban renewal and urbanisation in the Gauteng province.

I want to speak on a few  matters  regarding  air  pollution.  The  Minister
mentioned the Vaal Triangle. Sasol, one of the  biggest  companies  in  this
country, produced R4,7 billion of profits last year, but is probably one  of
the biggest culprits concerning air pollution in that  area.  The  emissions
generated by Sasol and the plants at Sasolburg probably  cause  more  health
problems in the Vaal Triangle in people of all ages and deliver  more  toxic
emission into the air than I  think  any  other  company  anywhere  in  this
country.

Sasol has been speaking about sustainable development  issues,  but  it  has
become urgent that we sit down with people in Sasolburg and say that we  are
not going to tolerate emissions of that kind. It is affecting the  lives  of
the poorest of the poor. The communities around Sasol  and  Sasolburg,  like
Sebokeng and Sharpeville, are the ones that really  suffer  because  of  the
emissions.

I also want to say that in Gauteng we have experienced a very high level  of
emissions arising from motor vehicles. Motor vehicle pollution  is  probably
higher than international guidelines in the Gauteng area.

This goes for all the core areas in Gauteng: the Greater  Johannesburg  area
and Tshwane, Ekurhuleni and the Sedibeng areas. It would be  useful  if  the
department could have a look at what  could  be  done  about  motor  vehicle
emissions in some of those areas. I know that some of these are  section  76
powers, but  I  think  it  is  important  that  the  Minister  engages  with
provincial departments and local authorities in order to do something  about
some of these levels of pollution.

The fear that we have in Gauteng is that we will  become  like  Tokyo.  When
that city was not managing its air pollution well, citizens used to  go  out
onto the streets wearing gas masks in order to make  sure  that  they  could
breathe properly. We know that in Mexico on the news on television one  gets
the weather report, the pollen report, and then they also have to  give  air
pollution reports so that people can decide: ``Today it is  better  to  stay
indoors and wear a mask and not go out.''

Fortunately, our region at the tip of Africa is known as one of those  parts
of the world where biodiversity, and so  forth,  is  still  strong.  We  are
probably one of the third most biodiverse countries in the world.  When  one
looks at Johannesburg and Gauteng the picture is quite different  and  quite
bleak. It is very important that we address that.

The reports for Egoli  2010  indicate  that  Johannesburg  citizens  at  the
moment spend some R280  million  every  year  for  over-the-counter  medical
preparations to help them  with  respiratory  infections.  These  infections
seem to be caused primarily by air pollution. That is R280 million a year!

We also know that one of the big culprits of air  pollution  is  energy  and
the way energy resources are being used. Coal and  coal  burning  is  a  big
issue. In the big houses, in the luxury townships, we switch on a light  and
we think that everything ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon member, your time is up.

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, is my time up already? [Laughter.]  I  spent  too
much time attacking the MEC. [Applause.]

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson,  this  day  is  specially  timed  to  have  this
plenary session in this House when it is the 46th birthday  of  the  Freedom
Charter.  So  I  say,  happy  birthday,  Freedom  Charter,  happy  birthday!
[Interjections.]

Haak Vrystaat! [Go, Free State!]

There is a Portuguese saying  -  and  I  will  not  say  it  in  Portuguese,
although I do speak Portuguese - that goes: ``Visits always  give  pleasure:
if not arrival, then the departure.''

On behalf of the Free State, I would like to convey  to  the  Minister  that
his recent visit to us  gave  pleasure  both  in  the  arrival  and  in  the
departure. The Free State is honoured to have  been  selected  to  host  the
launch of Environment Week on 5 June this year.

This auspicious occasion was celebrated in  the  historic  Batho  suburb  of
Bloemfontein where the ANC, of course, was founded in 1912.  Minister  Moosa
was able to pay a visit to the historic Mapikela  House,  the  home  of  the
first treasurer-general of the ANC. Local supporters in the crowd were  very
excited to hear the announcement  of  the  Clean  City  competition  by  the
Minister. Hence, the pleasure in  the  departure,  as  many  of  the  people
hurried home to begin working on plans to win the million which, of  course,
is a challenge to the rest of the country. The Free State is  determined  to
take the kudos, of course.

The Free State's department of environment and  tourism  has  also  accepted
the challenge of the Clean City concept. In fact, we have gone even  further
with the implementation of a pilot project in Mangaung, Bloemfontein,  which
is supported by the departments of local government and housing, health  and
environment and tourism. This has been named the Healthy City project.

As Free Staters, we are very concerned about  the  problem  of  toxic  waste
transportation. On two recent  occasions  we  have  had  spillage  of  toxic
materials  in  our  province.  Our  appeal  to  the  Minister  is  that  the
legislation  in  this  regard  be  revisited,  given  urgent  attention  and
strengthened where necessary.

Of grave concern to us is the lack of proper waste dumping sites in many  of
our rural municipal areas. A co-ordinated approach between  the  departments
of local government, water affairs and environmental affairs  could  rectify
this situation speedily. The Department of Health should  probably  also  be
directly involved in this interaction, as the number  of  people  scratching
for morsels of food among the discarded waste appears to  grow  daily.  This
will not only lead to the deterioration of our health  standards,  but  most
certainly will discourage visitors to our smaller towns, which are  in  dire
need of that added income.

We in the Free State have great respect for the Minister's handling  of  the
tourism  industry.  His  decisive  decision-making   impresses   and   gives
confidence to innovative thinkers. The recent signing  of  the  Drakensberg-
Lesotho transfrontier agreement is one such project. With the  stroke  of  a
pen, South African product owners and tourism  innovators  can  legitimately
engage in cross-border initiatives to mutual benefit. An issue  which  still
needs attention, however, is how to  speed  up  border  post  crossings  for
tourists.

The Free State is grateful to the Minister  for  his  initiative  in  making
Satour the mover and  shaker  responsible  for  the  generation  of  greater
tourist numbers to  South  Africa,  leaving  provinces  to  improve  tourism
statistics in their own domain. For the first time in three years, the  Free
State's department of environment and tourism has the funding  available  to
implement projects within our disadvantaged communities.

Currently, the Free State has a very active tourism industry centred  mainly
around the following: privately owned game farms where  game  viewing,  game
hunting and wing shooting safaris are available; nature  farms  which  offer
hiking trails, overnight facilities, horse riding, sailing,  mountaineering,
fishing, 4x4 trails, ecotourism,  historic  sites  and  San  paintings;  and
numerous bed and breakfast facilities, both in towns  and  on  farms,  which
provide a network of stopover places for weary travellers.

The above facilities, however, are still largely in the hands  of  only  11%
of the province's inhabitants. A huge challenge  confronts  the  Free  State
MEC and the department of environment and tourism to try to  transform  this
ownership through value adding, so that the majority of the  population  can
become part of this industry, without diminishing the role  of  the  current
product owners.

A lack of knowledge  regarding  the  spin-offs  from  tourism  and  a  clean
environment for the province and its people is still a  problem.  Rectifying
this problem is the highest challenge facing  our  department  in  the  Free
State. This message has to be given exposition from the  grass  roots  right
through to the highest level  of  function  within  the  province.  All  our
people need to know, to be reminded and reminded of the great  opportunities
which benefit the province and its  people  if,  as  individuals,  they  are
prepared to become involved, be it as goodwill ambassadors  with  smiles  on
their faces, or as pickers up of all the rubbish and cleaners of  their  own
home environment.

Each and every one of us as South Africans  can  contribute  to  making  our
areas safer and more tourist-friendly by talking to  and  sharing  with  our
friends and neighbours the importance of movement  and  feeling  secure  for
any visitors.

The dictionary defines a tourist as one who travels for  pleasure,  usually,
sightseeing and staying in hotels. This definition might have to  change  as
more and more of these tourists stay in  guesthouses  and  bed-and-breakfast
facilities.  This, of course, means, on the other hand, that  not  only  big
businesses are benefiting  from  visitors,  but  also  an  ordinary  average
person who has a home with a room or bed to spare if he or she so wishes.

The dictionary also says that a tourist is any person who travels, not  only
persons from another country. More and more South Africans are  choosing  to
travel within the boundaries of this beautiful land of ours. The  more  they
travel and experience the differences in the cultures of the  various  areas
and  local  people,  the  more  we  should  see  a  greater  tolerance   and
understanding developing  amongst  our  diversely  constitutionally  related
people. The  standard  of  living  is  improving  within  the  disadvantaged
communities  through  the  ANC-led  Government's   implementation   of   its
policies.  The  resultant  infrastructure  improvement   is   creating   new
opportunities for even more cross-culture initiatives.

There are  many  people  and  student  exchanges  into  and  from  our  very
communities. A truly South African exchange system  supported  by  business,
Government and  communities  could  further  fast-track  the  demolition  of
racism, misconceptions and fear. One  does  not  have  to  rewrite  a  book.
Continued support of and further implementation of the well-established  AFS
interculture-type programmes could be used.

I truly believe that  such  a  system  could  accelerate  the  united  South
African society so many of us would like to see.  School  pupils,  students,
professionals and all other  people  interested  in  broadening  their  life
experience within our country could participate. George  Bernard  Shaw  said
that  there  are  only  two  qualities  in   the   world,   efficiency   and
inefficiency,  and  only  two  sorts  of  people,  the  efficient  and   the
inefficient. There is still too much inefficiency in South  Africa,  and  in
the Free State too, for us to be able to capture a  big  enough  section  of
the huge financial opportunities generated by international tourism.

Only yesterday, it took one woman more than  five  phone  calls  and  longer
than half an hour to make a reservation at a  leading  hotel  for  a  single
night's booking. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Carry on, hon member.

Rev M CHABAKU: Is there curry?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I said, carry on, hon member.

Rev M CHABAKU: I thought that the Chairperson said  that  there  was  curry.
[Interjections.]

Only yesterday, it took more than five phone calls and longer than  half  an
hour to make a reservation at a leading hotel for a single night's  booking.
What kind of impression does this make on  visitors  from  overseas?  Nobody
can allow opportunities to slip  through  their  fingers  because  of  sheer
inefficiency. Urgent attention also needs to be given  to  the  agricultural
and ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time is up.

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, this was on behalf of my MEC, who, at  the  last
moment, could not come. I tried my best. [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister, members  from  the  provinces  and
colleagues, I am standing in the shoes of my MEC, Dawid Rooi. I  would  like
to just raise issues around  the  environmental  programmes  since  we  have
already touched on the tourism. I will  also  have  to  leave  some  of  the
issues because I have 14 points that I just want to raise for  the  sake  of
the department.

Regarding staff and budgetary constraints, the directorate had to cope  with
serious staff and  budgetary  constraints  during  the  past  two  financial
years, 1999-2000 and  2000-01.  A  total  staff  complement  of  only  three
environmental officers has dealt  with  environmental  issues  ranging  from
waste management and pollution control to  environmental  impact  assessment
reports  and  applications,  the  evaluation  of  mining   and   prospecting
environmental management ...

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, on a point of order: Will the hon member  take  a
message back to his MEC  that  Gauteng  will  sell  all  its  waste  to  the
Northern Cape so that they can improve their budget? [Laughter.]

Mr D M KGWARE: No, we do not want it.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  member  over  there,  please  sit
down.

Mr D  M  KGWARE:  Chairperson,  a  total  staff  complement  of  only  three
environmental officers has dealt with issues  such  as  coastal  management,
community-based environmental awareness and education  campaigns,  asbestos,
asbestosis and the London court case on asbestosis compensation.  These  are
a number of the areas that the directorate is dealing with.

The budget to carry out this function has also been limited to R1,2  million
and R950 000 in the two years, 1999-2000 and 2000-01, respectively.

Regarding  links  with  the  head  office,  the  provincial  directorate  of
environment and conservation could not effectively and  adequately  link  up
with the head office in Pretoria.  As  a  result,  most  inputs  which  head
office required the province to address were not attended to. That has  been
mentioned in paragraph 2 above.

The Orange River Mouth at Alexander Bay was long declared a Ramsar  site  by
the Ramsar convention. However, the site lost  its  status  because  of  the
negative impacts on it from the mining, flooding, etc of the Orange River.

Plans were, however, under way to restore the original  Ramsar  site  status
of the mouth and transfer the overall management to the directorate  in  the
year 2002-03.

Regarding the transfrontier conservation area, together  with  the  Namibian
counterparts, the Department of Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism's  head
office intends to declare the Ais-Ais Fish River National  Park  in  Namibia
and  the  Richtersveld  National  Park  in  South  Africa  as  a  TFCA.   In
particular, this move is aimed at boosting  the  tourism  industry  and  the
environmental and conservation  management  in  the  area.  Eventually,  the
Orange River Mouth Ramsar site will be part of the planned TFCA  which  will
be managed jointly by South Africa and Namibia.

Regarding coastal management,  the  Northern  Cape  has  nearly  380  km  of
coastal line on the Atlantic Ocean. Management of the coast  is  handled  by
the province on behalf of the Marine and Coastal Management  Directorate  in
Cape Town.

Coastal cleanup projects which are part of the provincial job  creation  and
poverty alleviation campaign will  be  implemented  in  due  course  from  a
British aid package to South Africa.

Nine  communities  of  municipalities   have   been   identified   for   the
implementation of the cleanup project in  the  province.  These  communities
are Calvinia, Sutherland, Loxton,  Klipfontein  near  Garies,  Groblershoop,
Prieska, Kimberley Landfill Site, Colesberg and Noupoort.

It is planned that in each community 50 men and women will be employed on  a
short-term  basis  for  three  months  at  R30  per  person  per  day.   The
implementation starts on 1 July 2001. This project is part of the  premier's
poverty alleviation and job creation programme in the province.

Regarding  waste  management  and  the  third  tier  of   Government,   most
municipalities and local government district councils in  the  third  sphere
of government  have  failed  to  cope  with  the  demands  for  sound  waste
management practice within their area of jurisdiction, and I think that  the
Minister has already mentioned that.
All environmental  management  programmes  and  projects  require  capacity-
building  through  their  appropriate  dedicated   environmental   education
programmes  in  order  for  them  to  succeed  and   be   sustainable.   The
directorate:environment and conservation is building in-house  strengths  in
personnel, educational materials and budgetary provision for this exercise.

Regarding  asbestos  and  asbestosis,  the  Northern  Cape  is  bearing  the
negative impacts and brunt of previous asbestos mining in the province.

The Department of Minerals and Energy is currently  rehabilitating  derelict
asbestos mines and the live asbestos dumps within former  mining  perimeters
which are contaminated. Areas outside the mining  boundaries  are  currently
not covered by that department.

We also have the remote granite and nuclear waste area  of  Namaqualand.  In
the province this is currently used  as  a  subterranean  disposal  site  of
nuclear waste from the South African  nuclear  power  plant  stations.  This
province has no expertise or facilities  for  the  effective  monitoring  of
this type of radioactive waste disposal.

Geological and geophysical prospecting and drilling in  the  Atlantic  Ocean
have led to the recovery of a  commercial  deposit  of  gas  and  petroleum,
nearly 80 km from the coast at Hondeklipbaai. Full-scale production  of  oil
and gas is expected to commence  in  2003.  Environmental  impacts  of  this
industrial activity will have to be managed in a sound manner.

Regarding the monitoring  of  environmental  impacts  of  the  developmental
projects, all development has such impacts, either in the short term  or  in
the long term. It  is  imperative  that  the  impacts  should  be  monitored
regularly, so that,  if  need  be,  appropriate  remedial  measures  can  be
effected timeously. The Northern Cape has unfortunately,  due  to  personnel
and budgetary constraints, never carried out an effective  monitoring  role,
in spite of the mandate it has to do so.

In conclusion, the challenges that  the  Northern  Cape  faces  in  handling
environmental issues within its  boundaries  are  daunting  but  manageable.
Given  the  appropriate  budgetary  provisions  and  logistical  support  in
personnel and equipment, it  will  be  easy  to  ensure  that  a  regulatory
framework on sound environmental management is upheld.  With  time  we  will
cope and exceed even better.

Chief M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, there  is  something  fishy.  Like  the  hon
Moosa, I am terribly disappointed by some comments made by the hon MEC  from
the Western Cape, who, instead of coming up with suggestions  or  solutions,
chose to attack and accuse the Minister and his  department  for  not  doing
enough. What a pity. Unfortunately, he was just preaching to  the  converted
and, maybe to try to respond to what he said, will make  people  not  notice
the difference. The select committee undertook a study  tour  to  Kalk  Bay,
Hout Bay and Saldanha  Bay  on  24  May  2001,  as  part  of  our  oversight
function. The main aim of this tour was to do the inspection in loco,  after
the committee received some complaints from people in those areas.

We carefully listened to what people had to say.  After  those  meetings,  a
report was compiled and a copy thereof was sent to the department for  their
scrutiny and response.  We  are  happy  and  delighted  to  learn  that  the
department has started addressing some of the issues raised. The  impossible
is often the untried. I am not going to fathom  this  industry,  because  we
will  be  discussing  the  issue  with  the  department  immediately   after
adjournment.

What  makes  me  sick  is  the  behaviour  of  some  political  parties  and
politicians, like the hon Adams, who now want to use  the  frustrations  and
desperation of our people to score political points. It  pains  me  to  know
that the very same people did not care  a  damn  about  the  plight  of  our
people in the past. Now they want to be seen as people who are fighting  and
championing their cause. What a shame! [Interjections.]

The question is: Where were they all this time? They had  all  the  time  in
the world to  rectify  and  correct  this  mess  created  by  their  regime.
Instead, they did not. They were just sleeping and snoring. [Laughter.]  Let
them be warned that we are watching them.

I would like to thank the hon  the  Minister  and  his  department  for  the
rehabilitation of mine dumps. The programme will  save  many  lives.  It  is
pleasing to know that waste management is high on the  department's  agenda.
Another worrying factor is  to  realise  that  many  factories  do  not  use
designated spots or areas for dumping. They use  any  available  open  space
for dumping. I can only urge the hon the Minister to be very hard  on  them.
In mining, we have direct beneficiaries and indirect  beneficiaries.  Can  I
find out from the hon the Minister what role is played by  mining  companies
and  the  Department  of  Minerals  and  Energy,  when  mining   dumps   are
rehabilitated?  I  do  not  think  it  is  fair  for   the   Department   of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism to carry this burden alone.

Let me  thank  the  hon  the  Minister  for  a  job  well  done,  informally
recognising tourist guides. Legislation  to  this  effect  was  passed  last
year. In the past nobody  cared  about  them.  I  would  like  to  urge  the
departments to make sure that these tourist guides are properly  trained  to
enable them to market our country, because we will know that if  one  shoots
at the moon, even if one misses, one is still high.

It is just unfortunate that we could meet SA National Parks. We  would  love
to engage them about some activities in our parks. Hopefully, when  we  come
back from our recess we will  meet  to  look  into  some  of  these  various
issues. Can  the  hon  the  Minister  tell  me  how  far  we  are  with  the
transformation  or  realignment  of  this  section?  The  attitude  of  some
officials in this  section  leaves  much  to  be  desired.  There  are  some
officials who behave as if  these  parks  are  now  their  family  property.
Trouble usually starts like fun. Maybe I should just leave it there,  hoping
that when we meet, some of these issues will be  clarified.  My  policy  is:
Just tolerate imperfect friends, because perfect friends do not exist.

With this dynamic, vibrant and humble Minister and his department's  policy,
the ANC will find it very difficult  not  to  support  his  Budget  Vote.  I
wonder what would have happened by now if the ANC was  not  in  charge.  For
the first time in the history of this country, our people are in warm,  safe
and reliable hands. The ANC fully supports this Vote and  congratulates  the
Minister on a job well done. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS  AND  TOURISM:  Mr  Chairperson,  many
issues have been raised in this debate, and I would like to thank  the  many
participants who have obviously put in quite a lot of  time  and  energy  to
prepare for the debate. As a result  of  the  many  issues  that  have  been
raised, I do hope that I will be  able  to  respond  to  them  in  the  time
allotted to me, and that with the hon  chairperson  having  just  taken  the
chair and being full of energy, he might not be in a hurry  to  call  me  to
order when my time has expired. [Laughter.] I  do  not  know  if  the  Rules
allow for pleading from the microphone.

Let me start off by expressing  my  gratitude  to  Rev  Peter  Moatshe,  the
chairperson, who has made the important point that many of  the  black-owned
emerging enterprises - SMMEs  -  are  having  a  great  deal  of  difficulty
getting on their feet as a result of a whole range of factors, one of  which
is the red tape.

I think this is an important point, because it is  one  thing  to  encourage
blacks to get into the tourism business  and  become  part  of  the  tourism
economy. Creating the actual  environment  for  that  to  work  is  another,
because at the end of the day, if one opens up a bed-and-breakfast place  or
something of that sort, or a curio shop, or a small hotel or  whatever,  one
will need somebody to come and stay there. One will need a sign on the  road
that says ``hotel'', or ``bed and breakfast in this  direction''.  One  will
need to be featured on maps and all of those sorts of things. One will  need
the banks to co-operate with one because  tourism  businesses  typically  go
through cycles.

Unfortunately, in our country we still have the cyclical patterns  which  we
are trying to do  without.  During  peak  periods  there  is  a  clutter  of
business and then during off-seasons there is no money  coming  in  for  the
business at all. One needs the co-operation of banks,  often  for  cash-flow
problems that arise as a result of this.

This is a problem. We have been  working  very  closely  with  the  Business
Trust in this regard. The Business Trust has now started what is called  the
enterprise development programme and  allocated  an  amount,  if  I  am  not
wrong, of about R60 million to that programme. The aim of the  programme  is
just to help businesses get on their feet. It is not to loan money,  put  up
infrastructure or anything of that sort. But where somebody  has  set  up  a
small business, it gets that business on its  feet  by  making  all  of  the
right sorts of connections and by  giving  training,  for  example,  to  the
owner if the person needs training, and such sort of  backup.  It  is  aimed
precisely at that. The department tells  me  that  many  thousands  of  real
businesses will be created in the  next  few  years  as  a  result  of  this
programme, so it is quite an important programme.

That there are distortions in the tourism infrastructure is, again,  a  fair
point - I think  -  and  it  is  something  that  we  are  looking  at.  The
department has got what it refers to as the patis, the  priority  areas  for
tourism infrastructure or something. I do not know exactly  what  it  stands
for. They have many acronyms. But they have identified a number of  priority
areas around the country for tourism  infrastructure  development.  This  is
where the infrastructure funds will be directed over the next few years.

We are also involved in discussions with the  National  Treasury  to  direct
some of the infrastructure funds that  the  Minister  of  Finance  announced
during his presentation of the Budget into that fund. We  are  working  very
closely with the Minister of Transport and the province to get the  N2  road
through the  Wild  Coast  finally  built.  The  Minister  of  Transport  has
reported to me that everything is in place  for  the  construction  of  that
road to get going. He and I will be going on a site visit  within  the  next
few weeks.

As far as the reports on SA National Parks are concerned, I  must  tell  the
hon Conroy that SA National Parks, like other conservation agencies  in  our
country, does go through financial difficulties from time to time and it  is
no secret that it is going through financial difficulties. However,  I  must
say that  much  of  the  reporting  in  the  newspapers  has  tended  to  be
inaccurate and hyperbolic. Like any business enterprise or any  institution,
one may find, from time to time, that one is  overstaffed  and  has  got  to
shed staff.

It happens in the Public Service  and  in  private  business,  and  it  will
happen in the parks. At times one absorbs staff and at times has to  let  go
of the staff, and the parks in some areas are in the process of  letting  go
of staff. One would not find a person who is being retrenched  thanking  the
boss very much, thanking him or her for retrenching  him,  saying  that  the
boss is doing the right thing and that he or  she  agrees  with  the  boss's
strategy. One will not find that. One is obviously  going  to  find  such  a
person saying that without him or her this park is going to collapse and  is
going to be destroyed. That is what workers who get retrenched anywhere  and
in any sector would say. I think one should take it with a  pinch  of  salt.
But that is not to say that SA National Parks is flush with money. It is  in
financial difficulties. My department  is  working  very  closely  with  the
Treasury and the parks in order to ensure that those financial  difficulties
do not result in any serious problems as such.

We see it essentially as a cash-flow problem, which arose as a result  of  a
number of factors, one  of  which  was  the  dip  in  the  tourism  numbers,
particularly to the Kruger  National  Park,  which  is  the  biggest  income
driver in SA National  Parks.  During  the  period  of  the  floods  tourism
numbers collapsed completely and that put the  national  parks  in  quite  a
difficult position. The second matter that caused the problem was the  doing
away with of what used to be called the transport subsidy  to  the  national
parks for the maintenance of the roads  and  such  things.  But  we  are  in
discussions now with Treasury to reinstate some of those subsidies.  We  are
also in discussion with SA National Parks to put in place  whatever  systems
are needed to get it on its feet. So there is no crisis, I must  assure  hon
members, because I think South Africans have the national parks  very  close
to their hearts. It is important for us to say that there is no crisis.

Recently, when the President went to  examine  some  of  the  reconstruction
work that was done  after  the  floods  in  the  Kruger  National  Park  and
surrounding areas, he  addressed  a  gathering  at  Skukuza  in  the  Kruger
National Park. I would want to refer hon members to his speech - one  should
get it on his website -  where  he  spoke  about  how  Government  sees  the
national parks. He made it absolutely clear that we have  no  doubt  in  our
minds that the protection, the  safeguarding  and  the  upkeep  of  national
parks must remain one of the  priorities  of  the  Government.  We  will  do
everything to ensure that they do remain the jewels that they are.

An important point was made by Mrs Z T Sebekedi about  domestic  tourism.  I
think this is a point we should not underestimate, that  is  the  importance
of domestic visitors within the tourism economy as  a  whole.  While  we  do
everything  to  encourage  international  visitors,  domestic  tourism  will
always be the most reliable source for our tourism  industry.  International
tourist numbers, as has been said quite  correctly,  can  easily  fluctuate,
and on a huge scale, depending on what is happening. If,  for  example,  the
economy of the source market collapses, one is going to find fewer  tourists
coming, or if we get some bad  publicity,  there  would  be  fewer  tourists
coming. But domestic tourists are always reliable. If there  are  floods  in
Mozambique, domestic tourists will not say, ``This year we are not going  to
Cape Town,'' as international tourists  do.  International  tourists  cancel
their trips to Cape Town when there are floods in Mozambique,  because  they
do not really  understand  the  geography  of  the  place.  So  we  must  do
everything to grow domestic tourism, and I hope  that  we  will  succeed  in
doing that.

Regarding the question raised by the hon Versfeld, the erosion at  Langebaan
is a matter which we need to look into quite  seriously.  We  must  bear  in
mind that these sorts of occurrences are often a  result  of  poor  planning
and  bad  development,  although,  as  the  member  has  pointed  out  quite
correctly, natural causes also are a  cause,  but  often  it  is  just  poor
planning and bad management.

We now have the National Environmental Management Act in place, and  one  of
the things that we can say is that in future such things will  certainly  be
avoided. My department  would  be  interested  in  playing  a  role  in  the
rehabilitation of the beach there, and I am informed by the department  that
we have not received any proposal as such from either  the  municipality  or
the province, and we would interact with the province in this regard to  see
what steps can be taken.

Usually in situations like those, the department would get  a  request  from
either the province or the municipality and we would then  try  to  look  at
where we can find the resources and what steps can be taken.

I must agree with the hon Vilakazi that all of the hon  members  here,  when
they rise on Thursday, would be taking a long and  extended  holiday.  After
what we heard about the Northern Province, perhaps that is where  we  should
go in order to promote tourism in that province.

On the remarks of the MEC Glen Adams there have already  been  responses  to
those, but let me say that the uncharacteristic belligerence  of  MEC  Adams
may be based  on  a  lack  of  information  or  on  inaccurate  information.
Firstly, I must say that prior to 1994 the poor  people  living  in  fishing
villages along the coast had absolutely no say  whatsoever  in  the  fishing
industry. They were cut out and thus were not part of fishing at all.  After
1994 this portfolio fell into the hands  of  somebody  from  the  MEC's  own
alliance, during the time of the Government of National Unity, when  the  NP
was running this portfolio.

It was only much later then when my predecessor, Dr Pallo Jordan, came  into
this post that the Marine Living Resources Act was passed, and  the  process
of transformation and that of attending to the needs of the poor had  begun.
Legislation was in place when I came into this portfolio which  started  the
process of actual implementation as such.

During the time when the  MEC's  alliance  partner  was  in  government,  as
anybody can tell the MEC, the actual substance of the fishing  industry  was
something  that  was  completely  neglected  and  misunderstood  by  the  NP
government.

So what  is  it  that  we  have  done?  There  has  been  a  great  deal  of
transformation over the past few years in terms of  the  ownership  patterns
of the big companies. In terms of blacks gaining equity in some of  the  big
companies, there has been a great deal of transformation. Secondly, when  it
comes to the allocation of quotas to new entrants, a very large  number,  in
fact over 50% of all of the quota holders, now are people who  were  not  in
business before 1994. All of these are new quota holders. They are  not  all
big and successful, but they are new quota holders. The MEC might  not  have
known about that.

When it comes to the subsistence fisheries, for the first time this year  we
were able to issue subsistence permits all along the coast. In  places  like
the West Coast, for the first time  in  their  lives,  women  were  directly
given permits to harvest fish. If one  had  gone  to  visit  the  people  in
Elands Bay, Lambert's Bay or Doring Bay, and places like those, those  women
would say that it was not even in their dreams that one day  they  would  be
given  permits  to  fish.  Perhaps  the  MEC  did  not  have  all  of   this
information.

Regarding  poverty  relief,  last  year  my  department  spent   R70 million
directly on poverty relief projects, and I am  not  talking  about  fishing.
That is putting money into the pockets of the  poor  people  doing  a  whole
range of different  sorts  of  projects.  This  year  we  will  be  spending
R99 million, and if one takes the trouble to look at the MTEF one  will  see
that next  year  R175 million  is  earmarked  for  my  department  to  spend
directly on poverty relief projects.

In my main presentation I spoke about the Coast Care programme  and  various
others. All of those are poverty relief projects, and, for the  first  time,
we actually have some injection of  money  going  into  these  poor  coastal
areas. It is something that has never happened before. Then I must say  that
the MEC's attempt to quote my speech in the National Assembly was a  bit  of
a failure because he quoted me incorrectly.

What I was saying about the Huxley commission  was  that  they  adopted  the
view that the observations of the ordinary  fishermen  were  not  important.
That is a point that I was making. I was saying that we must  not  make  the
same mistake ourselves.

What the  MEC  also  does  is  he  presents  a  very  empty  intellectualist
approach. The MEC says, ``Let us listen to the ordinary people, let  us  not
read big books.'' That is what the MEC says. Firstly, Mr Adams must be  told
that I do not need him to tell me to be in touch with the  ordinary  people.
I can assure him that I have been in touch with them and I am in touch  with
more ordinary people, not only along the coast, but all  over  the  country,
than he will frankly ever be for the rest of his life, because that  is  all
that I have done.

The MEC attacked an intellectual tradition which exists, I must say,  within
the ruling party, but certainly within my department also; one which we  are
proud of. Our scientists in the department do read big books and we are  not
ashamed of that. I will tell the MEC  why.  That  is  because  in  countries
where they have not managed their fishing  stocks  on  a  proper  scientific
basis, they are suffering today.  In  South  Africa,  our  hake  stocks  are
increasing. Last year, we granted a total allowable catch of  155 000  tons.
This year, it went up to 166 000 tons. Some of the big stocks -  apart  from
those that are being poached, like abalone - like pelagics, hake,  etc,  are
increasing.
In Europe, the catch is decreasing. The caught  stocks  had  to  be  cut  by
about 50%, and if the MEC had completed the speech he was quoting, he  would
have seen that. As a result of that, the fishing fleets in Europe are  at  a
standstill right now. That is because we are serious about what  we  do.  We
want to engage in rigorous  intellectual  activity  on  which  we  base  our
policies, and that is  something  that  I  would  really  recommend  to  the
Western Cape. I think that if they develop an intellectual tradition in  the
Western Cape, they will not be sorry about that.

On the comments of the hon Sulliman, I must say that I am one of  those  who
adopt the view that the Northern Cape has lots and  lots  of  potential  for
tourism, especially if one  takes  into  account  that  it  is  a  very  big
province from a geographical point of view, and it has  a  relatively  small
and sparse population.

Growth in tourism could make a very  big  difference  to  the  socioeconomic
standards of the population in the Northern Cape. I was in Namibia  recently
and had discussions with my counterpart there. We hope that very shortly  we
will  be  able  to  sign  the  agreement  for  the  establishment   of   the
Richtersveld-Ais-Ais Transfrontier  Conservation  Area  in  order  to  boost
tourism in that part of Southern Africa even more.

The point which Mr McKenzie  made  about  the  need  for  co-operation  with
communities which are next to parks is  well  taken.  I  think  that  it  is
something that we will have to work on an ongoing basis.

The hon Durr raised interesting suggestions about the  West  Coast  National
Park. I certainly found that interesting and I think that  it  is  a  matter
that we will certainly pursue for the consolidation  of  the  area.  It  may
well appear to members and me that the parcel of land which  the  SANDF  has
under its control currently is not really needed by them, but I  can  assure
hon members that when my director-general speaks to the generals, they  will
have very complex and complicated reasons  why  they  need  it.  But  it  is
something worth pursuing, I think.

The hon Silke spoke about the airlines policy, and this is a matter that  we
are  seized  with.  My  department  and  the  Department  of  Transport  are
interacting very regularly. It is a very difficult situation. It is  not  as
simple and easy as I thought, once one gets into the bowels of the  problem,
but it is certainly something that needs to addressed.

His sentiments were, in a certain sense, also shared  by  the  President  in
his state-of-the-nation address,  when  he  said  that  this  year  we  must
increase airline frequencies and capacity into and out of South  Africa.  It
is something that we are working on.

As far as the work of South African tourism is concerned, I  must  tell  him
that, notwithstanding the observations that he  has  made,  the  observation
that has been made by the industry and people around the world, is  that  SA
Tourism is doing much better than it has ever done before. In fact,  it  has
come out of a very old archaic way of working and transformed itself into  a
modern organisation.
Let  me  assure  hon  members  that  there  are   some   very   hard-working
representatives of SA Tourism in various parts of the world  who  are  doing
excellent work. Much more needs to be  done,  there  is  no  question  about
that. But I do think that quite  a  good  job  is  being  done,  under  very
difficult circumstances. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

                       AIRPORTS COMPANY AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Chairperson, hon members,  the  object  of  the  Airports
Company Amendment Bill is  to  effect  a  minor  change  to  and  remove  an
irregularity in the Airports Company Act.

In terms of the current Airports Company Act, the Airports Company of  South
Africa, generally known as Acsa, is granted a five-year permission  to  levy
charges related to airport core  activities.  [Interjections.]  Being  in  a
minority is not nice.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! continue, hon member.

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Airport core activities are  those  activities  that  are
essential to the functioning of the airport, such as runway  fees.  However,
they do  not  include  incidental  matters  such  as  commercial  businesses
located at the airport.

Section 12(11)(a) of the Act  states  that  the  regulating  committee  may,
after consultation  with  Acsa  and  other  interested  parties,  amend  any
condition of the permission given to Acsa to levy airport charges, with  the
approval of the Minister of  Transport  and  Acsa.  The  proposed  amendment
seeks to remove the anomaly of the regulating committee  having  to  consult
with Acsa regarding a proposed  change  of  condition  and  then  having  to
obtain the approval of Acsa and the Minister of Transport.

In terms of the amendment, the regulating committee will no longer  have  to
obtain the approval of Acsa, but it will still  have  to  consult  with  the
company on any proposed changes. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Declaration of vote:

Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, the New NP believes that although  the  amendment
is regulatory in nature, it is an important piece of legislation.  The  Bill
serves to amend the Airports  Company  Act  of  1993,  so  as  to  make  new
provisions for the amendment of the conditions of the permission  issued  to
the Airports Company to levy airport  charges,  with  the  approval  of  the
Minister of Transport and the company.

Previously the Act required the regulatory committee  to  consult  with  the
company and to obtain the approval of the company, as well as  that  of  the
Minister. The effect of  the  amendment  is  that  although  the  regulating
committee will still have to  consult  with  the  Airports  Company  on  any
change to levies, it will not have to obtain the company's approval.

My party believes that this is a sensible  ruling,  and  therefore  supports
the Bill. [Applause.]

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                      ROAD ACCIDENT FUND AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Chairperson, being a  chairperson  means  one  can  speak
twice in a Chamber.

Road safety programmes have become  indispensable  tools  in  our  fight  to
limit the expenses incurred by the Government in dealing with  the  enormous
financial costs resulting from road accidents.  Every  year  the  Government
has to allocate huge sums of money as a result of a  large  number  of  road
accidents. The money we spend in response  to  accidents  could  be  put  to
better use in addressing some of our more pressing social problems, such  as
poverty alleviation.

Furthermore,  the  large  number  of  road  accidents   has   wider   social
implications. It places enormous strain on  our  health  system,  with  many
victims needing expensive  treatment,  such  as  surgery  over  an  extended
period. It also impacts  negatively  on  our  economic  growth  through  the
reduced productivity of victims who need  weeks  and  months  to  recuperate
before they can resume work.

To reduce our expenses incurred as a result of road accidents,  we  need  to
spend more money on their prevention. For this  reason,  we  should  welcome
the Road Accident Fund Amendment Bill. The Bill  seeks  to  amend  the  Road
Accident  Fund  Act  in  order  to  authorise  a  fund  to  make   financial
contributions to  road  safety  programmes  and  projects  approved  by  the
Minister of Transport, such as the Arrive Alive campaign.

Although the impact of this amendment may not be felt immediately,  it  will
have a number of positive spin-offs in the  long  term,  not  only  for  the
provinces, but also for the  Road  Accident  Fund  itself.  [Interjections.]
Liyangxola eli lungu. [The hon member is making a noise.]

Provinces will be able to augment their Arrive Alive campaign  budgets  with
funds obtained from this fund. These funds will in turn be used to  increase
motorists' awareness of road safety and to encourage  them  and  pedestrians
to  observe  all  road  traffic  measures.  The  effects  of  an   increased
observance of road safety measures will mean fewer road accidents which,  in
turn, will reduce the number of claims  brought  before  the  Road  Accident
Fund. This  amendment  will  clearly  result  in  a  win-win  situation  for
everybody involved in road safety and should be  supported  by  all  of  us.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Declaration of vote:

Dr  P  J  C  NEL:   Mnr   die   Voorsitter,   die   Nuwe   NP   beskou   die
wysigingswetsontwerp as  wenslik  omdat  die  stuk  wetgewing  nou  aan  die
Padongelukfonds  die  bevoegdheid   verleen   om   bydraes   te   maak   tot
padveiligheidsprojekte en -programme wat deur die  Minister  goedgekeur  is.
Tot dusver was alle bydraes wat die Padongelukfonds byvoorbeeld tot die  Kom
Veilig Daar-veldtog gemaak het  onwettig  aangesien  daar  geen  voorsiening
daarvoor in die Padongelukfondswet van 1996 gemaak is nie.

Dit is nie 'n gesonde toedrag van sake nie. As in ag geneem word  dat  sowat
10 000 mense jaarliks hul lewe op ons paaie verloor en die  totale  beraamde
uitgawe vir die staat as gevolg van padongelukke  waarin  derduisende  mense
beseer en vermink word in die jaar 2000 R13,8 miljard  beloop  het,  is  dit
nodig dat alle projekte wat deur die  departement  geloods  word,  uit  alle
oorde ondersteun behoort te word.

My party wil die hoop uitspreek dat die Departement van Vervoer alles in  sy
vermoë sal doen om die Padongelukfonds, wat tans teen 'n  geweldige  verlies
van  R10,48  miljard  funksioneer,  so  spoedig  moontlik  op   'n   gesonde
sakegrondslag te plaas. Dit is nodig om die fonds in staat  te  stel  om  'n
substansiële belegging in veiligheidsprojekte te maak.

Dit is ook belangrik dat dié beleggings dividende sal oplewer  in  die  vorm
van 'n aansienlike vermindering in ongelukeise wat teen die  fonds  ingestel
word.

Die Nuwe NP steun die  wetsontwerp.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
declaration of vote follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Mr Chairperson, the New NP  regards  the  amendment  Bill  as
expedient because  this  piece  of  legislation  will  now  grant  the  Road
Accident Fund the power to make contributions to road  safety  projects  and
programmes  which  have  been  approved  by  the  Minister.  Thus  far   all
contributions made by the Road Accident Fund, for  example,  to  the  Arrive
Alive campaign, were regarded as illegal because no provision was  made  for
this in the Road Accident Fund Act of 1996.

This is not a healthy state of affairs.  If  one  takes  into  account  that
approximately 10 000 people die on our roads annually  and  that  the  total
estimated cost for the state amounted to R13,8 billion in the year  2000  as
a result of road accidents in which thousands upon thousands of  people  are
injured and disabled, it is necessary that all projects which  are  launched
by the department should be supported by everyone.

My party wishes to express the hope that the Department  of  Transport  will
do everything in its power to bring  the  Road  Accident  Fund  to  a  sound
business  foundation  as  quickly  as  possible,  because  currently  it  is
functioning at an enormous loss of R10,48  billion.  This  is  necessary  to
enable the fund to make substantial investments in safety projects.

It is also important that these investments yield dividends in the  form  of
a substantial reduction in accident claims  which  are  lodged  against  the
fund.

The New NP supports this Bill. [Applause.]]
Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

     B.     Meeting with Ambassador


         Prof Bengu, the South African Ambassador to  Germany,  briefed  the
         delegation on the Binational Commission between  South  Africa  and
         Germany, for the purpose of facilitating  high-level  dialogue  and
         promoting co-operation on key issues of national concern  to  South
         Africa and Germany.


         The  following  five  focal  areas  were  identified  for   further
         consultation and negotiation:


         1. Educational and vocational training.


         2. Promotion of the private sector, particularly small businesses.


         3. Low-cost housing and infrastructural development.


         4. Rural development and management of natural resources.


         5. Government and administrative  advisory  services,  particularly
              at provincial level.


         The delegation was further informed that the Embassy is at  present
         involving  churches  and  the  private  sector  to  assist  in  the
         elimination of  poverty  in  South  Africa.  Strategies  have  been
         developed by  the  Embassy  to  ensure  collaboration  between  the
         government, the private sector and churches.


         The Germans have developed very  good  policies  on  education  and
         skills training in order to deal with poverty and  unemployment.  A
         study of these in particular would be of use to South Africa.
         The  delegation  noted  that  the  South  African   government   is
         embarking on policies aimed at transformation and development,  and
         that the Committee will benefit from this study tour.


     C.     Consultation 1: German National Coalition for Implementation  of
         UN Convention for Protection of Children's Rights in Germany


         1. Introduction


              The delegation was briefed by Dr Beate Schmidt-Behlau, Dr Jorg
              Maywald and Mr Karl Spath of the Coalition.


              The delegation learnt that on 24 May  1995,  40  German  NGOs,
              engaged in the field of child and youth welfare and  policies,
              formally founded the Coalition. By September 1999, the  number
              of affiliates had risen to 90 organisations, covering a  broad
              spectrum of areas pertaining to the rights of the child.


         2. Aims of Coalition


              (1)  To  encourage  and  monitor  government  action   towards
                  implementation of the convention.


              (2) To invite promotors from a broad cross-section of  society
                  to act towards the implementation of the  convention,  and
                  to hold conferences, workshops and open fora  on  relevant
                  issues.


              (3) To discuss and disseminate the convention in  Germany  for
                  all children up to the age of 18.


              (4) To support the involvement of children and young people in
                  the discussion and implementation of the convention.
              (5) To exchange information on the process  of  implementation
                  at  international   level   and   inform   members   about
                  activities in the  international  field  through  the  NGO
                  group in Geneva.


         3. Structure and working method


              Since March 1996 the German Child Welfare  Alliance  has  been
              hosting the secretariat of the Coalition. Start-up funding was
              provided from the foundation Deutsche Jugendmarke and  enabled
              the  Coalition  to  employ  a   full-time   co-ordinator   and
              secretariat for a year.


              Further funding from the German government has been secured up
              to the year 2001. A steering committee of 16 members, eight of
              whom represented organisations affiliated to the German  Child
              Welfare Association, agreed on a list of principles,  statutes
              and regulations.


              Its decisions are based on consensus among all members, and it
              meets regularly, about every two to  three  months.  In  March
              2000 the steering group  nominated  Mike  Corsa  and  Dr  Jorg
              Maywald as speakers  of  the  Coalition,  for  two  years.  In
              accordance with the member organisations, this group  develops
              a plan of action and decides  on  strategies  to  promote  the
              implementation of the convention.


              As a follow-up on activities  recommended  in  the  concluding
              observations of the Committee,  the  steering  group  examined
              particular themes mentioned in the statement of the  Coalition
              on the government report submitted to  the  Committee  on  the
              Rights of the Child in Geneva in 1995.


         4. Topics covered


              Working  groups  are  sometimes   established   to   draw   up
              recommendations, policies and strategies. These are  discussed
              in the steering group and then forwarded  to  the  government,
              Parliament, the media and the broad  public,  to  promote  the
              full implementation of  the  convention  in  their  respective
              areas.


              Topics that have been dealt with since  the  establishment  of
              the Coalition, are -


              (1) the rights of the child in the reform of parent and  child
                  law;


              (2) ecological rights of children;


              (3) rights of asylum-seeking children, child soldiers and  the
                  rights of children in war;
              (4) rights of children in institutions,  for  example  in  the
                  school system;


              (5) rights of needy children and allocation of resources;


              (6) rights of disabled children;


              (7) rights of children without German passports.


         5. Ministerial support


              The Ministry for Youth and Family Affairs has  financed  1 200
              "media suitcases", which were  distributed  to  libraries  and
              institutions working to promote  the  convention.  A  suitcase
              consists of  a  selection  of  the  best  materials  currently
              available in Germany on children's rights, including  a  video
              series on 20 articles of the convention by German  TV,  music,
              books and a  public  relations  manual  for  teachers,  social
              workers and professionals, in order  to  make  the  convention
              widely known.


              They have a  law  which  bans  violence,  especially  corporal
              punishment, including emotional  violence,  against  children.
              There are also interesting programmes, for example a programme
              aimed at helping children catch up on what they did not  learn
              at school, and a programme called "youth in  work"  for  young
              people who cannot find jobs. The project endeavours  to  skill
              the youth for specific jobs and then find them employment.


              Their definition of children is also interesting. They  define
              a child as being from birth to 14, and a youth as being 14  to
              18.


              Their education takes longer than other countries:  Preprimary
              learning takes place from three to six years. Entrance  is  at
              seven years, and they spend 19 years at school. They therefore
              enter university or other tertiary institutions  at  a  fairly
              mature age of over 24, and they complete  their  education  at
              between 26 and 30 years of age. They therefore enter  the  job
              market at a much later stage.


              They  have  an  ombudsperson  in  each  State,  looking   into
              children's  issues.  These  ombudspersons   are   within   the
              administration and reports to the administration.  Their  main
              aim is towards  ensuring  protection  of,  provision  for  and
              participation towards the best interests of  the  child.  They
              ensure that there is a comprehensive  approach  on  children's
              issues; for example, when they plan traffic  laws,  they  take
              children's needs into account.


         6. What seemed to work well


              (1) The structured working relationship between the government
                  and NGOs seemed to bring positive results,  and  thus  the
                  movement is growing.


              (2)  Media  suitcases  are   an   excellent   idea   for   the
                  dissemination of information.


              (3) Extra programmes for learners who cannot cope.


              (4) The longer period of education results in  a  more  mature
                  and better skilled workforce.


              (5) The idea of ombudspersons and the consultative  mechanisms
                  involving children.


         7. Lessons learnt


              (1) They have access to more funds.


              (2) They have a low rate of unemployment.


              (3) They do not have infrastructural backlogs.


              (4) They do not have a large illiterate population.


              (5) They do not have problems of stark poverty.


     D.     Consultation 2: German Central Institute for Social Matters


         1. Introduction


              The delegation had consultation and briefing sessions with  Mr
              Burkhard  Wilke,  Managing  Director  of  the  Institute.  The
              Institute collects and stores information on  a  database  and
              supplies information to those who need it.


         2. Budget


              The Institute is to a  large  extent  self-sustaining.  It  is
              partly financed by the Ministry of  Social  Affairs,  and  70%
              comes from charity organisations, from the  interest  on  fees
              derived from auditing charity organisations and from fees paid
              by various organisations and individuals for the provision  of
              information.


         3. Focus


              The Institute provides services mainly in Berlin. It  supplies
              information on social issues, leaders in the field, books  and
              articles on  issues  of  social  interest,  lists  of  charity
              organisations  in  the  field  of  environmental  and   animal
              protection and developmental aid.


         4. Method of operation


              The Institute does not conduct research, but collects research
              material from universities and provides  it  to  the  clients.
              They  also  gather  information  from  literature,  scientific
              journals and books.


         5. Clients


              Information is provided to students and private  associations;
              the Minister of Labour  and  the  National  Coalition  on  the
              Implementation of the Convention of the  Child;  industry  and
              commerce;  the  German  Chancellor  of  Cities;  welfare   and
              Catholic associations; donors and students of social work; and
              universities of applied science.


         6. Kinds of services provided


              (1) Information on CD ROM.


              (2) Books.


              (3) Monograph.


              (4) Magazines.


         7. What seemed to work well


              (1) Centralised collection and dissemination of information.


              (2) Efficient and well-run service.


         8. Obstacles


              (1) Lack of infrastructure in rural areas would make a  centre
                  of this kind inaccessible to many.


              (2) Cost would be a problem.
              (3) Poverty would make it difficult  for  people  to  pay  for
                  services, hence self-sufficiency  would  be  difficult  to
                  attain.


     E.     Consultation 3: Basic Programmes of Prevention,  Rehabilitation,
         Policy and Rights of Disabled People


         1. Introduction


              The delegation had a consultation and briefing session with Dr
              Hartmut Haines, Head of the Section.


              The briefing focused on the following:


              (1) Accessibility of buildings for disabled people.


              (2) Social levy system.


              (3) Integration and special schooling system.
              (4) Training of disabled people.


              (5) Monitoring role  of  the  Section  on  policy  related  to
                  disabled people.


         2. Accessibility of buildings


              New buildings established, are accessible to disabled  people,
              but old ones are not. Future planning on the construction  and
              reconstruction of buildings will take into account  the  needs
              of the disabled.


         3. Policy in respect of disabled


              (1) To take steps to ensure that disability is reduced through
                  preventative measures.


              (2) To ensure that disabled people are fully  integrated  into
                  the mainstream, failing  which,  they  must  have  special
                  provisions in order to obtain education and  become  self-
                  sufficient.


         4. Interesting areas


              (1) Social levy system.


              (2) Integration and special schooling system.


              (3) Training of disabled people.


              (4) Employment of disabled people.


              A law requires that every employer must  employ  at  least  5%
              (previously  6%)  disabled  people.  Should  they  receive  an
              application from a  disabled  person  and  select  a  "normal"
              person for the job, then, to the  extent  that  they  are  not
              fulfilling the 5% requirement, they have to pay a levy to  the
              government (for not complying with the quota).  Those  who  do
              employ disabled people, but do not have the full quota, pay  a
              levy of 200 DM. Those who do not employ any  disabled  people,
              however, pay a much higher levy. This levy goes into a fund to
              be utilised for the needs of the disabled.


         5. What seemed to work well


              The levy system was unique and seemed to achieve its goals.


         6. Obstacles


              Access to buildings, etc, was not well developed.


     F.     Consultation 4: Head  and  Assistant  Head  of  Interministerial
         Staff  at  Representative  of  Federal   Government   for   Affairs
         concerning Disabled People


         1. Introduction


              The delegation had a discussion with  Mr  Bernhard  Schneider,
              the Head, and Dr Gerhard Polzin,  the  Assistant  Head.  Their
              briefings focused on -


              (1) the legal framework; and


              (2)  the  integration  of  disabled  persons  in  the  Federal
                  Republic of Germany.


              According to section 10 of  the  Rehabilitation  Harmonisation
              Act, medical services  for  rehabilitation  should  cover  all
              areas  of  support  necessary   to   prevent   a   threatening
              disability, to eliminate a disability, to alleviate it  or  to
              prevent its aggravation.


              According to section 100  of  the  Act,  an  employer  with  a
              workforce of 16 or more are obliged to ensure that at least 6%
              of the workforce comprise severely disabled persons.
              This obligation applies not only to the  private  sector,  but
              also to  public  employers.  The  federal  employment  service
              monitors the fulfilment of this obligation through a system of
              compensatory levies payable by employers who fail to meet  the
              obligation. The revenue from these levies may only be used for
              employment promotion and vocational advancement in respect  of
              severely  disabled  persons;  details  are  embodied  in   the
              Severely Disabled Persons Compensatory Levy Regulation.


         2. Rehabilitation of disabled persons


              (1)  If  a  person  suffers  from  a   physical,   mental   or
                  psychological  disability,  he  or  she  is  entitled   to
                  assistance, regardless of the cause of disability.


              (2) Benefits  such  as  medical  and  financial  benefits  are
                  provided, regardless of  whether  the  person  receives  a
                  disability pension or not.


              (3)  Where  necessary,  medical  rehabilitation  benefits  are
                  provided through hospitals or special facilities.


              (4)  Vocational  rehabilitation  benefits  assist  to  help  a
                  disabled person to keep or get a job.


              (5) This also include other forms of employment and vocational
                  promotion assistance, aimed at making it  possible  for  a
                  disabled person to find adequate and suitable work in  the
                  job market or in a workshop for disabled people.


         3. Vocational youth training centres
              These  centres  work  in  conjunction  with  firms  in   their
              respective regions to provide initial vocational training  for
              young disabled persons who require medical, psychological  and
              educational  assistance  as  a  result  of  their  disability.
              Germany has built up a network of 46 vocational youth training
              centres with a capacity for some  12 300  trainees.  Eight  of
              these centres with  an  admission  capacity  of  approximately
              2 300 are located in the former East Germany.


         4. Vocational retraining centres


              The centres also work together with firms in the  regions  and
              provide retraining and further training  for  disabled  adults
              who require medical,  psychological  and  similar  assistance.
              Germany's network of  28  vocational  retraining  centres  has
              capacity for 15 000  trainees.  Seven  of  these  centres  are
              located in eastern Germany.


         5. Vocational training centres


              These centres are special rehabilitation  centres  for  people
              with  mental  disabilities.   They   aim   to   help   people,
              realistically assessing their job prospects so that  they  can
              rejoin the mainstream job market or go on courses for training
              or retraining. There are currently eight  vocational  training
              centres, with a total of 457 places.


         6. Vocational rehabilitation clinics


              These are special  rehabilitation  clinics  for  persons  with
              special disabilities, such as  head  injuries,  paraplegic  or
              heart diseases. At present, Germany has 17 such clinics,  with
              2 780 beds, in the western part of the country.


         7. Workshops for disabled persons


              These workshops  offer  suitable  jobs  for  persons  who  are
              permanently or temporarily unable to find  employment  in  the
              open  market,  due  to  the  nature  or  severity   of   their
              disability.


              They provide disabled persons with an opportunity to  develop,
              increase or regain the ability to work  productively,  and  to
              earn a wage while doing so. At present, Germany has 640 State-
              approved workshops which offer  166 000  jobs;  173  of  these
              workshops, with approximately  27 000  jobs,  are  located  in
              eastern Germany. Disabled persons working  in  each  of  these
              workshops are covered under Germany's health, accident,  long-
              term care and pension insurance schemes.
         8. Special provision for severely disabled persons


              As a severely disabled  person,  one  can  claim  benefits  to
              assist  in  compensating  for   disadvantages   arising   from
              disability. These benefits  are  normally  contingent  on  the
              existence of specific health conditions, and include -


              (1) tax concessions (in particular, the standard allowance for
                  disabled persons);


              (2) free public transport;


              (3) reduced vehicle taxes;


              (4) special parking facilities;


              (5) exemption from radio and television licence fees.


         9. Free public transport


              If a disability significantly reduces mobility in  respect  of
              road traffic or if a person is incapacitated or  deaf,  he  or
              she is entitled to free public transport on  production  of  a
              pass that is marked accordingly. This applies to trams, buses,
              suburban trains and railway travel, where they are part of  an
              integrated regional transport system. The subsidiary system of
              free transport is limited to  second  class  travel  on  local
              trains within 50 km of the person's home.


         10.     What worked well


              (1) The four-step approach that has been developed, has a  lot
                  of merit. It is clear  and  precise  about  the  different
                  categories of disabled persons and who qualifies for  what
                  kind of assistance.
              (2) Their youth development programme  is  also  a  very  good
                  model.


         11.     Obstacles


              Lack of funds is a problem, but not the major problem.


     G.     Consultation 5: International Street Children  Archive  Research
         and Counselling Centre


         1. Introduction


              The delegation had consultation and discussion with  Dr  Dolly
              Conto Obregen, Director of the Centre. The briefing focused on
              the number of activities and projects in respect of  the  main
              task of the centre - street children, in Germany as well as in
              other locations, such  as  Africa,  Asia,  Latin  America  and
              Europe.


         2. Background of Centre


              The Centre was  established  in  1984  to  document  the  work
              already achieved and  the  different  approaches  to  homeless
              children or street children. Since 1994, the Centre  has  been
              systematically involved in the situation of  street  children,
              both from a research perspective and from a rehabilitative and
              service perspective. Since then, the Centre has realised that,
              in order to be able to develop  lasting  solution  approaches,
              political   intervention,   international   discussions    and
              networking are needed. At present, the  Centre  has  developed
              four projects in respect of street children.


              (1) Information desk project


                  The main focus  of  this  project  is  the  collection  of
                  documentation, project  evaluation,  publications  of  any
                  kind (books, scientific  papers  and  materials  from  all
                  media sectors),  and  to  make  these  available  to  both
                  researchers  as  well  as  the  public.  The  aim  is   to
                  accelerate research  concerning  street  children  and  to
                  develop approaches towards a solution  for  this  category
                  of person.


              (2) Research project


                  Based on the analysis of existing approaches,  the  Centre
                  attempts to demonstrate  new  research  fields  with  this
                  project, where a network of institutions  and  individuals
                  aspire to seek practical solutions.


              (3) Counselling project


                  The  findings  from   the   documentation   and   research
                  activities on the life of street children has  contributed
                  to the counselling work directed towards the following:


                  (a)     Political    institutions,    NGOs,    scientists,
                       educational specialists,  street  workers,  teachers,
                       pupils, students of social  science  and  humanities,
                       and  towards  all  people  who  are  interested,  and
                       active, in the field.


                  (b)  Offering students a service package  to  prepare  for
                       practical  placements  abroad,   as   well   as   for
                       activities in Latin America, Asia, Africa and Europe.


         3. Main work activities


              The main work activities  of  the  Institute  focused  on  the
              following  four  issues:  Documentation;   public   relations;
              training courses and placement; and regional and international
              networking.


              (1) Documentation


                  (a)  Archives about street children all over the world.


                  (b)  Articles in newspapers and magazines.


                  (c)  Unpublished documents.


                  (d)  CD-Roms, internet publications.


                  (e)  Photo exhibitions.

                       and Europe.


              (5) Regional and international networking


                  (a)   Exchange  of  experiences   and   reinforcement   of
                       dialogue.


                  (b)  Improvement of scientific co-operation.

         5. Obstacles


              Placement of children abroad is not such a good idea.


     H.     Consultation 6: Parliamentary State Secretary and Deputy Head of
         Division of Children and Youth Policy


         1. Introduction


              Dr Edith Niehuis, the Parliamentary State  Secretary,  and  Mr
              Jochen Weitzel, Deputy  Head  of  the  Division,  briefed  the
              delegation on the German governmental policy and programme  in
              respect of children and youth.


         2. Child and youth policy


              The  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  has  a  wide-ranging  and
              socially underpinned system of child and youth services. Child
              and youth services describe  the  area  of  social  work  that
              serves to promote the  development  of  young  people  outside
              school.


         3. Youth reports


              Of particular importance to the child and youth policy are the
              youth reports on the situation of young people and the welfare
              achievements of child and youth services,  which  the  federal
              government has to present to the Bundestag  and  Bundesrat  in
              each parliamentary term. Apart from  assessing  and  analysing
              the  current  situation,  the  reports  contain  proposals  on
              further developing child and youth services,  and  each  third
              report should provide an overview of the overall situation  in
              respect of child and youth services.


              The youth report have, inter alia,  two  important  functions.
              These are to make the public aware of the situation  of  young
              people, and to encourage all spheres of  society  to  take  on
              activities which will promote the interests  of  children  and
              young people.


              As already mentioned, child and youth policy cuts across  many
              different policy areas. Family reports are  presented  in  the
              family policy area. The nine youth  reports  and  four  family
              reports which have appeared to date,  document  studies  which
              describe in detail the  situation  and  living  conditions  of
              children, young people and families in Germany. These  reports
              also have a considerable impact on the legislative process  on
              children  and  youth,  on  family  policy,  and  on   specific
              political measures.


         4. What worked well


              (1) Media protection is well-run.


              (2) Youth programmes are good.


         5. Obstacles


              Funding.


         6. Principle of subsidiary bodies responsible for child  and  youth
              services agencies


              One of the main features of child and youth  services  is  the
              activities of voluntary and  statutory  bodies.  NGOs  make  a
              commitment. In the field of youth work, day care for  children
              and residential  care,  the  voluntary  sector  provides  most
              services and facilities.


         7. Statutory youth services


              Statutory youth services represent another  dimension  of  the
              child and youth services system. Together with  the  voluntary
              youth services, they implement the Child and Youth Service Act
              at three levels:


              (1) Federal level


                  The Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior  Citizens,
                  Women and Youth is responsible for  preparing  legislation
                  and  financing  measures  of   national   importance   and
                  programmes intended to serve as a model for the child  and
                  youth plan of the federation.


              (2) Local self-government level


                  They have to legislate for  their  own  areas.  Child  and
                  youth policies are developed  by  voluntary  organisations
                  within  the  parameters  of  the  UN  Convention  and  the
                  Federal Act on Child and Youth Services.


              (3) State level


                  Programmes for child and youth care  have  to  be  drafted
                  for the development of youth.


         8. Voluntary services structure at three levels


              (1) National level (at this  level  models  for  projects  are
                  developed).


              (2) State or provincial level.


              (3) Local or municipal level.


              In addition, to ensure uniformity and cross-border uniformity,
              the federal government has now appointed a Committee of  State
              Secretariat,  and  it  reports  to  the  Youth  Ministry.   In
              Parliament, they also have a youth commission, comprising  all
              parties. There are youth offices responsible for advisory, co-
              ordinating  and  regional  planning   and   further   training
              functions.


         9. Local child and youth services agencies


              The main burden of statutory  youth  services  work  falls  on
              youth  offices  in  districts   and   in   towns   which   are
              administrative districts in their own right.


              The Child and  Youth  Services  Act  entrusts  them  with  all
              decisions  relating  to  individual  welfare  cases  and  with
              responsibility  for  curatorship  by  the  youth  office   and
              guardianship.


         10.     Participation by young people


              Youth participation in shaping youth services is not merely  a
              procedural requirement, but also an essential element for  the
              effectiveness of the  service  itself.  The  Child  and  Youth
              Service Act lays down as a basic principle that  children  and
              young people are to be involved, in line with their  level  of
              development, in all decisions concerning them,  taken  by  the
              statutory youth services bodies.


              According to this Act, children and youths must be informed in
              an  appropriate  manner  of  their  rights  in  administrative
              proceedings and in proceedings before the  guardianship  court
              and the administrative court (s8 - Child  and  Youth  Services
              Act).  Furthermore,  the  law  expressly  provides   for   the
              participation of children or young people in the selection  of
              an institution or foster  home  within  the  scope  of  socio-
              educational provision outside the  family  (s36  -  Child  and
              Youth Services Act).


         11.     Media and protection of young persons
              Section 6 of the Act regulates the dissemination  of  writings
              harmful to young persons. It sets out cases  where  the  media
              must be regarded as a source of danger  to  the  young.  Among
              media representatives likely to cause serious  harm  to  young
              persons, are those who -


              (1) are racist;


              (2) deny the holocaust;


              (3) glorify violence;


              (4) play down violence;


              (5) represent  violence  in  a  manner  which  violates  human
                  dignity, for instance child pornography.


              Media members putting young  persons  seriously  at  risk  are
              indexed by law. In other  words,  there  are  restrictions  on
              making their work available.
         12.     Laws relevant to children and youths


              In addition to the basic provisions, there  are  many  general
              laws such as the German Civil Code, the German Penal Code, the
              Federal Social Assistance Act  and  the  Employment  Promotion
              Act, which are of particular significance to  children,  young
              people  and  families.  There  are  also   laws   which   deal
              exclusively with the specific problems of children  and  young
              people, for example the -


              (1) Juvenile Court Act;


              (2) Protection of Young Persons at Work Act;


              (3) Promotion of the Voluntary Social Services Year Act;


              (4) Promotion of the Voluntary Ecological Service Year Act;
              (5) Vocational Training Act;


              (6)  Vocational  Training  Assistance  through  Planning   and
                  Research Act;


              (7) Adoption Procedures and Implementation Act;


              (8) Federal Education Grants Act;


              (9) Child and Youth Services Act.


         13.     What worked well


              (1) The string of laws are good.


              (2) They are able to tackle the aftermath of HIV/AIDS.


     I.     Guided tours


         The  delegation  went   on   three   guided   tours   of   historic
         significance.


         1. House of Wannsee Conference


              Introduction


              In this house, on 20 January 1942, 14  top  officials  of  the
              ministerial bureaucracy and the SS,  led  by  SS  Obergruppen-
              führer Reinhard Heydrich, chief of  the  Reich  Security  Main
              Office, discussed the  organisational  implementation  of  the
              decision to deport to the East and murder the Jews of  Europe.
              The meeting was called the "Wannsee Conference".  The  summary
              of the Conference, prepared by Adolf Eichmann,  was  found  in
              1947 in the files of the German Foreign Office.


              On the 50th anniversary of the Conference, 20 January 1992,  a
              memorial and education centre was opened  in  the  villa.  The
              house now has three sections:


              (1) Permanent exhibit


                  This exhibits documents not only the conference, but  also
                  its history, starting in 1933, and its conseguences  until
                  1945. it provides basic information on the entire  process
                  of segregation, persecution,  deportation  and  murder  of
                  European Jews. A separate section deals with  the  history
                  of the building.


                  The photographs used, were almost without  exception  from
                  officials, as well as a few private  German  sources,  and
                  were unpublished  at  the  time.  Exceptions  were  German
                  Jewish  activities  after  1933,  taken  by  Jewish  press
                  photographers, and the  liberation  of  the  concentration
                  camps in 1945, shot by Allied cameramen.


              (2) Educational section


                  This section offers youth and adult group  study  days  or
                  longer seminars  geared  towards  specific  interests  and
                  professions,  in  or  out  of  school.  A  wide  range  of
                  subjects is offered.


              (3) Mediotek


                  This contains the standard  academic  literature,  fiction
                  and eye-witness reports on  Nazi  history,  literature  on
                  Jewish  history,  anti-Semitism,  racism  and  neo-Nazism,
                  reference works, a document collection  on  microfilm  and
                  microfiche,  a  picture  and  sound  archive,  films   and
                  videos. These materials  are  available  for  use  on  the
                  premises by seminar participants and individual visitors.


         2. Sachsenhausen former concentration camp


              The visit revealed the horrors of Nazi rule  and  the  inhuman
              conditions under which prisoners were forced to live.


         3. Gandhi to Walesa Museum


              This Museum was housed in a building used as an office at  the
              Check Point Charlie Border  Post.  It  is  dedicated  to  non-
              violence action and non-violent struggle for human rights.  It
              is a comprehensive collection of information, photographs  and
              material in respect of  six  different  non-violent  struggles
              around the world.


              It is of importance to note that South Africa and Germany have
              certain common features:


              (1) There are similarities in both situations,  in  that  both
                  are transforming and grappling  with  issues  of  poverty,
                  unemployment, racism and degradation.


              (2) Germany has more resources, and their problem  is  not  as
                  huge as ours.


              (3) They are also integrating  two  States  and  creating  new
                  systems  and  policies  in  terms  of  international  best
                  practice.


              The tour therefore has revealed many lessons of importance for
              South Africa.


     J.     Recommendations


         1. To SA National Youth Commission


              (1) Germany has access to more funds than we do. They  have  a
                  low rate  of  unemployment,  they  do  not  have  a  major
                  infrastructural backlog, they do not have a large rate  of
                  illiteracy and they do not have as much poverty  as  South
                  Africa.


                  The  Committee  recommends  that  the  strategy  of  media
                  suitcases, comprising publications  on  children's  rights
                  made available to the youth, be  studied  closely  with  a
                  view to copying it.


              (2) Their vocational youth  training  centres  and  vocational
                  retraining centres are excellent  methods  of  passing  on
                  skills to young people. It may  be  a  good  programme  to
                  copy.


              (3) Their programme  of  youth  reports  to  be  presented  to
                  Parliament  each  term,   with   proposals   for   further
                  development and giving an overview  of  the  situation  of
                  youth and children, is an  excellent  method  of  constant
                  review and planning. These reports are  also  based  on  a
                  holistic approach. For  example,  there  were  nine  youth
                  reports and four family  reports  during  the  Committee's
                  visit,  and  those  reports   helped   when   looking   at
                  legislation and policy issues.


              The  Committee  recommends  that  the  above  be  investigated
              further.


         2. To Department of Social Development


              (1) They have a comprehensive  system  of  social  assistance,
                  which needs to be studied  to  help  our  planning  for  a
                  comprehensive social assistance system. Apart from  social
                  assistance, they offer benefits to all  disabled  persons,
                  whether these persons receive social  assistance  or  not.
                  There  is  a  system  of  tax  concessions,  free   public
                  transport,  reduced   vehicle   taxes,   special   parking
                  facilities  and  exemption  from  radio   and   television
                  licences.


                  The Committee recommends that the  above  be  investigated
                  further.


              (2) They have a clear policy in four areas of  assistance  for
                  the disabled:


                  (a)   Social  assistance  for   persons   suffering   from
                       physical,   mental   or   psychological   disability,
                       regardless of the cause of disability.


                  (b)  Medical and rehabilitative benefits are provided  for
                       anyone who needs it, regardless of whether the person
                       receives a disability grant or not.


                  (c)  Education in  an  open  school  as  well  as  special
                       schools geared towards vocational  rehabilitation  is
                       provided for those who are trainable and may be  able
                       to work. They also get assistance to enable  them  to
                       keep a job.


                  (d)  For those who can compete in the open  market,  there
                       is a levy system to encourage employers to employ and
                       promote them.


                       The levy system is legislated, and says that at least
                       5% of the staff of every employer must  be  disabled.
                       If an employer receives an application for a job  and
                       a non-disabled  person  is  selected,  then,  to  the
                       extent that the  5%  requirement  is  not  met,  that
                       employer  has  to  pay  a  levy  to  the  government.
                       Employers who do not employ any disabled persons, pay
                       a higher levy than those who employ some but have not
                       fulfilled their quota. The money goes into a fund  to
                       be used for the needs of the disabled.


                  The Committee recommends that the  above  be  investigated
                  further.


              (3) Legislation and policy are designed to apply at  national,
                  provincial and local government level. There are  problems
                  in  ensuring   uniformity   while   allowing   for   local
                  peculiarities.


                  The Committee recommends that  this  interesting  area  be
                  studied further by those looking  at  comprehensive  child
                  and youth legislation and policy.


              (4) The Committee also recommends that the German control over
                  the media in the interest  of  children  also  be  studied
                  further, in order to look at openness against a degree  of
                  censorship.


         3. To Department of Education


              (1) The introduction of vocational training for  young  people
                  and  the  relationship  between   training   centres   and
                  employers, factories  and  industries  make  the  training
                  relevant and ensures that students  are  trained  for  the
                  work they intend to do. This is working well and helps  to
                  focus on skills development.


              (2) They have a longer period of schooling, which ensures that
                  workers are more mature and  better  able  to  handle  the
                  stresses and strains of work.


              (3) Their efforts to integrate disabled children into the main
                  stream  of  education,  while  also  ensuring  that   some
                  specialised schools are retained, is  an  experience  from
                  which  we  can  learn  in  our  education   transformation
                  process.


              The  Committee  recommends  that  the  above  be  investigated
              further.


         4. To Department of Labour


              (1) The co-operation between the Department of Labour and  the
                  education sector in vocational training is worth copying.


              (2) The levy system to encourage employers to employ  disabled
                  people is also an important system to further study,  with
                  a view to implementation.


              The  Committee  recommends  that  the  above  be  investigated
              further.


         5. To Office of Deputy President


              Policies and legislation compiled and applied by  the  Germans
              have many important features, as outlined above.


              The Committee recommends that  these  be  studied  further  in
              order to see what is already in place in our country, what  we
              still need to do and how  we  can  adapt  some  into  our  own
              legislative and policy framework.


         6. To Joint Monitoring Committee


              (1) The Germans have a conference  with  NGOs  and  groups  of
                  children and youths to discuss issues identified  by  them
                  and to look at ways of overcoming problems. Thus they  can
                  identify what is happening on  the  ground  and  what  the
                  feeling is, and then come up with suggestions.  These  are
                  submitted  to  the  Ministers,   to   look   at   possible
                  legislation or policy  shifts.  This  is  a  good  way  of
                  involving  the  sector  in  a  constructive  way  and   in
                  ensuring that  laws  and  policies  are  not  static,  but
                  continually change to provide for new needs.


              (2) They also have a  unique  central  research  and  resource
                  bank, where material on all aspects of development  issues
                  can be found. Such a facility can assist in ensuring  that
                  there is a flow of information  and  that  people  do  not
                  repeat what has been tried previously,  but  are  enriched
                  by those previous experiences.
              The  Committee  recommends  that  the  above  be  investigated
              further.


         7. To Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology


              (1) Three museums were visited, and each  was  unique  in  its
                  historic    and    comprehensive     research     content.
                  Interestingly,  they  were  still  looking   for   further
                  history  and  artifacts.  Each   also   had   a   specific
                  educational content, and encouraged schools,  universities
                  and   communities   to   participate   in   seminars   and
                  discussions.   Issues   such   as    poverty,    violence,
                  unemployment, racism and degradation are depicted  in  the
                  exhibitions and then discussed. Important lessons  on  how
                  to   preserve,   collect,   annotate    and    disseminate
                  information, can be learnt from these museums.
              (2) South Africa's history of  wars,  racism,  apartheid,  the
                  freedom struggle, peaceful negotiations and  accommodation
                  of diversities are important  lessons  for  posterity.  If
                  collected, preserved  and  annotated  comprehensively,  it
                  can become an  important  message  for  the  international
                  community.


              The  Committee  recommends  that  the  above  be  investigated
              further.


     K.     Conclusion


         The  Committee  delegation  was  well  received  by  their   German
         counterparts at all the institutions and  federal  ministries.  The
         study tour was rich in briefing sessions, to enable us  to  compare
         South African experiences with those of  the  Federal  Republic  of
         Germany.


         The German social levy  system,  the  training  and  employment  of
         disabled persons and the youth services programmes served  as  good
         examples for our country, with a view to improving the  quality  of
         life and status of our children, youth and disabled persons.
