   ENDORSEMENT OF HEAVY SENTENCES HANDED DOWN BY COURTS FOR SERIOUS CRIMES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr J L MAHLANGU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that since the beginning of this year, our courts  have  handed
       out heavy sentences in a number of serious criminal cases,  including
       -


       (a)  the double life sentences imposed yesterday  on  three  men  who
           were convicted for the killing of two guards,  during  the  1999
           cash-in-transit heist in Olifantsfontein;


       (b)  the life sentence imposed on a serial rapist by  the  Cape  High
           Court;


       (c)  the double life sentence handed down by the Pretoria High  Court
           to an HIV-positive man found guilty of  raping  two  11-year-old
           girls;
       (d)  the life sentences imposed  on  two  Cape  Flats  gangsters  for
           robbing, raping and killing two matric schoolgirls; and


       (e)  the  double  life  sentences  imposed  on  the  Valencia  Farmer
           killers;


  (2) believes that  these  sentences  are  the  positive  results  of  the
       introduction by Government of new measures aimed at combating violent
       crimes, such as the minimum sentencing guidelines;


  (3) commends members of the police and prosecutors who work tirelessly on
       these cases to ensure the convictions; and


  (4) wishes to assure them of its continued support in the  fight  against
       violent criminals.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Is  there  any
objection to the motion?

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move as an amendment:


  That, in paragraph (2), ``Government'' be substituted by ``Parliament''.

Legislative measures are put in place by Parliament.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  member
Mahlangu?

Mr J L  MAHLANGU:  Chairperson,  obviously  Parliament  approves  Government
policy. The  initiators  of  this  policy  are  indeed  the  Government  and
therefore I think it is better to say  ``Government'',  because  it  is  the
Government that implements as the executive.  Legislation  actually  effects
those undertakings. I think the spirit is the same, but I  would  appreciate
it if we retained ``Government''. I think Mr Matthee will consider this.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  Mr  Matthee,
are you convinced?

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I then move:


  That,  in  paragraph  2,   after   ``Government''   be   inserted   ``and
  Parliament''.
I really think Parliament is important here.

Mr J L MAHLANGU: I agree to that, Chairperson.

Amendment agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Motion, as  amended,  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the
Constitution, namely:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that since the beginning of this year, our courts  have  handed
       out heavy sentences in a number of serious criminal cases,  including
       -


       (a)  the double life sentences imposed yesterday  on  three  men  who
           were convicted for the killing of two guards,  during  the  1999
           cash-in-transit heist in Olifantsfontein;


       (b)  the life sentence imposed on a serial rapist by  the  Cape  High
           Court;
       (c)  the double life sentence handed down by the Pretoria High  Court
           to an HIV-positive man found guilty of  raping  two  11-year-old
           girls;


       (d)  the life sentences imposed  on  two  Cape  Flats  gangsters  for
           robbing, raping and killing two matric schoolgirls; and


       (e)  the  double  life  sentences  imposed  on  the  Valencia  Farmer
           killers;


  (2) believes that  these  sentences  are  the  positive  results  of  the
       introduction by Government and Parliament of new  measures  aimed  at
       combating violent crimes, such as the minimum sentencing guidelines;


  (3) commends members of the police and prosecutors who work tirelessly on
       these cases to ensure the convictions; and


  (4) wishes to assure them of its continued support in the  fight  against
       violent criminals.

        FIRST EVER BLACK FEMALE PILOT IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN AIR FORCE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with pride the achievement of Lt Annabel Macauley,  who  became
       the first ever black female South African Air Force pilot;


  (2) further notes  that  this  magnificent  accomplishment  was  achieved
       against the many obstacles that face black women in South Africa; and


  (3) congratulates Lt Macauley on her achievements and wishes her the very
       best in her new career.
[Applause.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       PRECEDENCE TO ORDER OF THE DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That precedence be given to Order No 2 on the Order Paper.

I have communicated  with  the  party-political  Whips,  as  also  with  the
Ministers involved.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  I  would  like
to take this  opportunity  to  welcome  the  hon  the  Minister  for  Public
Enterprises and call upon him to address this House.

                            ESKOM CONVERSION BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)
The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Chairperson, hon members, I am  pleased
to table before this Council the Eskom Conversion Bill. I wish to  take  the
opportunity,  though,  of  commending  the  chairperson  of  the   portfolio
committee, Mr Fenyane, and other members of the Select Committee  on  Labour
and Public Enterprises for their sterling work and for the  discipline  that
has been displayed during the challenging period leading  to  where  we  are
right now. I am aware that because of the nature  of  this  Bill,  there  is
consensus  amongst  the  various  political  parties  on  its   object   and
mechanisms.

Allow me to also thank the various stakeholders  who  made  submissions  and
engaged the department on the content of  the  Bill.  I  will  always  value
these engagements which have impacted positively on the content and  quality
of the Bill that we are tabling this afternoon.

This Bill has its origin in the Eskom Amendment Act  of  1998.  Hon  members
will recall that Eskom had previously not been subjected to tax, nor  liable
for the payment of dividends to the Government as a shareholder.  The  Eskom
Amendment Act of 1998 paved the way for the removal  of  Eskom's  tax-exempt
status and also required the Minister for Public Enterprises to  incorporate
Eskom as a public company, in terms of the Companies Amendment Act of  1989.


I must emphasise that this is a technical Bill  that  seeks  to  incorporate
Eskom as a public company, as I have indicated. It  also  seeks  to  achieve
this objective in a manner that will deem  Eskom  to  be  converted  into  a
public company, without interfering with any of its current  operations  and
obligations. To restate this  fundamental  point,  there  will  not  be  any
tampering with the running of Eskom as a business,  despite  the  repeal  of
the Eskom Act of 1987.

To ensure continuity, the shareholder compact, as well as the  articles  and
memorandum of association of the converted Eskom, will serve  as  custodians
of  any  responsibilities  imposed  by  the  Eskom  Act,  even  beyond   the
incorporation.

Allow me to also highlight some of the  key  benefits  of  this  conversion.
Amongst others, are the facilitation  of  payment  of  dividends  by  Eskom,
which will allow our  Government  to  access  resources  within  state-owned
enterprises and Eskom in particular in a  manner  that  is  consistent  with
good corporate governance and  sound  business  practice.  Access  to  these
resources will further enhance the ability of the Government to  deliver  on
its commitment, in terms of the Reconstruction  and  Development  Programme.
The intention of the ANC Government is, one, to apply  all  these  resources
in a manner that contributes towards the upliftment  of  the  lives  of  our
people, and also strengthens the South African economy; and, two,  levelling
the  playing  field  and  ensuring  consistency   with   other   state-owned
enterprises,  who  are  already  incorporated  in  terms  of  the  Companies
Amendment Act of 1989, such as Transnet and Telkom.

The two-tier structure of the electricity council and the  management  board
will be done away with. This will be replaced by a board  of  directors,  to
be  appointed  by  the  Government  as  a  shareholder.  In  addition,   the
appointment of a board of directors will also facilitate the development  of
a very effective relationship with the  Government  as  a  shareholder,  and
thereby improve corporate governance.

This conversion will also bring Eskom in line  with  the  type  of  business
entity that is more acceptable and  well  understood  internationally.  This
can only have a positive effect in terms  of  Eskom's  global  standing.  It
will also enhance the ability of Eskom to achieve its strategic  intent,  to
be the pre-eminent African energy and related business  of  global  stature.
We need to encourage  national  champions  that  are  African  and  globally
competitive so that they can serve as catalysts for growth  and  development
in Southern Africa and the whole of the African continent.

I want to emphasise one point, that the Eskom Conversion Bill is  not  about
its privatisation. The reality of the matter is that the state  remains  the
sole shareholder in Eskom. The fears generated  in  the  public  domain  and
carried by editorials of various newspapers, such as the  Sunday  Times  and
The Pretoria News, are clearly unfounded. When  I  see  a  poster  with  the
words: ``Hands off Eskom'', it reminds all of us of the critical  role  that
Eskom continues to play in the quality of life of  our  people  and  in  the
whole of the South African economy.

Our Government will not be irresponsible, and does not seek to  destroy  the
capacity that vests in Eskom, built over many, many decades.  The  strategic
challenge for the Government, through its restructuring programme,  will  be
to enhance Eskom's capacity in a  strategic  manner  towards  our  goals  of
growth and a better life for our people.
Let me emphasise that the issue of Eskom's ownership and the change  thereof
is a policy issue that has not been finalised  by  the  Government  as  yet.
This Bill, therefore, does not in any way pre-empt or limit the  policy  and
restructuring options that could be adopted in the future.

Even though as the Government we have  stated  our  approach  regarding  the
restructuring of the energy sector, this is done, and is going to  be  done,
within the context of retaining Eskom as a dominant  energy  player.  It  is
our intention as the Government to  engage  with  organised  labour  on  the
various restructuring options for Eskom.

I must also add that the place for such engagements is not this  forum,  but
the national  framework  agreement  between  the  Government  and  organised
labour. I wish,  therefore,  to  take  this  opportunity  to  reiterate  the
Government's commitment to a process of rigorous engagement  with  organised
labour on all restructuring matters.

My office has received enquiries from various provinces, such  as  the  Free
State, Western Cape and others, regarding the impact of  this  Bill  on  the
price of electricity. I must state categorically that  this  Bill  will  not
affect the price of electricity. There is no link between the  act  that  we
are going to  be  performing  today  and  the  increase  in  the  prices  of
electricity.

In any event, it is important to point out that increases in  the  price  of
electricity must be approved by the National Electricity Regulator, or  NER.
Therefore, Eskom is  not  in  a  position  to  unilaterally  do  so  without
following the necessary approval processes.

Our commitment as Government to Eskom's developmental role  in  our  society
is beyond any reproach. The Bill provides that the memorandum  and  articles
of association, as well as the shareholder compact, must take into  account,
amongst others, Eskom's developmental role.

This is proof enough of our Government, as well  as  Eskom's  commitment  to
making electricity accessible to all our people  as  we  have  done  in  the
past. We have stated before that Eskom occupies a  very  strategic  position
in our economy and it is, therefore, critical  to  the  realisation  of  our
efforts for a better life for all our people. Hon members would  agree  with
me that it has not been easy to come  this  far,  especially  with  all  the
placards outside.
Let me, therefore, conclude  by  sincerely  thanking  all  hon  members  for
having turned this process  into  a  reality.  Allow  me  in  conclusion  to
express, once again, a word of gratitude  to  Advocates  Selokela,  Mbangeni
and Mkhize from the office of the Chief  State  Law  Adviser  for  the  good
advice and guidance that they have provided. Allow  me  also  to  thank  the
team from Eskom who are here today, Dr Benji Mothibedi, Mr Mpho Matjila  and
Mr Mohammed Adam, together with the officials from my department, for  their
commitment in taking forward the mandate of the Government, despite all  the
pressures and obstacles. [Applause.]

Mr S L E FENYANE: Chairperson, I  would  like  to  say  thank  you  for  the
opportunity given to me to speak. I rise to extend the Select  Committee  on
Labour and Public Enterprises's support for the Bill. I would like  to  take
the opportunity to thank  the  department  under  the  able  stewardship  of
Minister Jeff  Radebe  and  the  Eskom  team,  not  forgetting  the  Matjila
brothers, for the support they gave us when  we  navigated  the  passing  of
this Bill through the parliamentary committee's onerous processes.

The processes were occasionally punctuated with hurdles, but  the  committee
and the department persisted and prevailed, nevertheless. The Bill seeks  to
convert Eskom from a statutory body into a public company  which  is  solely
owned by the state. The immediate question that comes to one's mind is:  Why
the conversion? Why do we not leave Eskom as  it  is?  These  are  immediate
questions.

In 1994, roughly 255 000 households had access to electricity,  and  12%  of
these  represented  rural  households.  Eskom,  at  the   behest   of   this
Government,  increased  access  to  electricity  to  roughly  1,75   million
households as at 31 December 1999. Now the question is: Why do  we  have  to
convert Eskom? That is the question.

In an attempt to answer this question, I will employ a philosophical  gambit
to motivate my submission. I will start with inspirational words  of  advice
said by Niccolo Machiavelli in his  letter  to  the  prince,  which  are  as
follows:


  You must know, then, that there are two methods of fighting: the  one  by
  law, the other by force. The first method is that of men, the second,  of
  beasts. But as the first method is  often  insufficient,  one  must  have
  recourse to the second.
This parable symbolically teaches us to acknowledge that  the  modern  world
we live in is fraught with contradictions and controversies. As  Machiavelli
correctly advised the prince, we  should  be  able  to  assume  the  beastly
personality of a fox in order to recognise traps in the global bush, and  we
should also assume the beastly personality of lions  in  order  to  frighten
off wolves in this bush,  when  we  employ  the  second  method  posited  by
Niccolo Machiavelli.

The end of the cold war has ushered in the new era, in which  the  hegemonic
statuses of  the  United  States  and  Russia  are  being  interrogated  and
redefined. The world society  is  continuously  undergoing  a  metamorphosis
whose manifestations  are  reflected  in  the  perpetual  recasting  of  key
political and economic relationships.

The modern world is no  longer  state-centric.  The  rise  of  multinational
corporations and their growing importance as  instruments  of  globalisation
essentially imply that political diplomacy is no  longer  the  preoccupation
of nation states. Economic and industrial diplomacy has  become  central  in
international relations, as the sovereignty of the state is gradually  being
eroded. Even war itself has lost  its  somewhat  nuanced  legitimacy  as  an
instrument of statecraft.

The global village is now arguably controlled by the IMF,  the  World  Bank,
the WTO, multinational corporations and the G8 countries.  In  the  face  of
this hostile environment, countries are expected to shape  up  or  ship  out
and assume the marginal role of peripheral states of the world.

Indeed, the question is not whether  there  is  globalisation  or  not.  The
question is: How do we protect national  interests  on  the  one  hand,  and
adjust ourselves to cope with incremental demands of  globalisation  on  the
other hand? We cannot just sit, pray  and  hope  that  problems  will  solve
themselves. We have to  position  ourselves  appropriately  for  any  future
eventuality,  hence  the  attempt  by  the  state  to  transform  all  state
parastatals, so as to bring them in line with contemporary realities.

The conversion of Eskom into a public company is not an attempt  to  dismiss
employees. Clause (4)(c) in  the  Bill  addresses  the  concern  of  Eskom's
employees adequately. The core developmental role of Eskom is  to  roll  out
universal access to affordable electricity for  all  our  people.  The  Bill
itself indicates that when the Minister determines the  shareholder  compact
and the articles of association, he  or  she  must  take  into  account  the
developmental role of Eskom.

We should understand that Eskom has other roles as well,  such  as  entering
the African market and electrifying Africa for the  advancement  of  African
unity and the African Renaissance. For  it  to  fulfill  these  obligations,
Eskom has to be competitive and its management has  to  embrace  the  letter
and the spirit of co-operative governance.

I am informed that a conservative market capitalisation  of  Eskom  is  R100
billion. So, its restructuring is expected to inject  massive  capital  into
the fiscus and our GDP. When competition eventually comes, we  will  not  be
found wanting. Malcolm X correctly argues  that,  and  I  quote:  ``Tomorrow
belongs to people who plan it today''.

Those who do not plan, and specialise in  criticising  and  lamenting  will,
finally, regress into a primitive stage of development, with the  hope  that
God can place them back into the world's  only  tensionless,  classless  and
blissful environment, which is one's mother's womb. We  cannot  go  back  to
that. We cannot regress as a country, since our earliest primitive stage  of
development was apartheid, and we do not need that.

So we must continue to position ourselves strategically for the future.  Now
is the time for us to do that, because nothing  lasts  forever.  Even  one's
appearance does not last. Today one is one person, and tomorrow a  different
person. We need to position ourselves for the future.  We  cannot  just  say
that because Eskom is doing certain things today, it  will  continue  to  do
those things tomorrow. Nothing lasts forever. So, let us position  ourselves
for the future. [Applause.]

Dr  P  J  C  NEL:  Voorsitter,  hierdie  wysigingswetsontwerp  is  'n   baie
belangrike stuk wetgewing, aangesien die  verspreiding  en  voorsiening  van
elektrisiteit aan die normale huishouding 'n onmisbare element is om in  die
basiese behoeftes van die gemeenskap  te  kan  voorsien.  Die  voldoende  en
ononderbroke voorsiening van elektriese  krag  is  vandag  die  belangrikste
kommoditeit vir die ontwikkeling, instandhouding en  uitbreiding  van  enige
land in die wÃªreld se ekonomie. Die wetgewing het ten doel om  Eskom  om  te
skakel  van  'n  statutÃªre  regspersoon  na  'n  openbare  maatskappy,   met
geÃ¯nkorporeerde aandelekapitaal in terme van die Maatskappywet. My party  is
van mening dat die ontbinding  van  Eskom  op  die  lang  duur  'n  gunstige
uitwerking sal hÃª op die lewering van  dienste  aan  die  gemeenskap  in  'n
ontwikkelende  land  soos  Suid-Afrika,  waarin  die  stygende  aanvraag  na
elektrisiteit  'n  realiteit  is.  (Translation   of   Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, this amending Bill is a very important piece  of
legislation, because the distribution  and  supply  of  electricity  to  the
conventional household is an essential element in meeting  the  basic  needs
of the community. Today the  adequate  and  continuous  supply  of  electric
power is the most important commodity for the development,  maintenance  and
extension of the economy of any country in the world.  This  legislation  is
aimed at converting Eskom from  a  statutory  legal  entity  into  a  public
company, with incorporated share capital in terms of the Companies  Act.  My
party is of the opinion that in the long run the dissolution of  Eskom  will
have a positive effect  upon  service  delivery  to  the  communities  in  a
developing country such as South Africa, where  the  increasing  demand  for
electricity is a reality.]

My party has great appreciation  for  the  fact  that,  according  to  their
annual report for 2000, Eskom has achieved its  commitment  of  electrifying
1,75 million homes, one year earlier  than  originally  planned.  Since  the
inception of Eskom's electrification programme in  1991,  a  total  of  2,39
million homes have been electrified.

My party believes that the shareholder compact on the performance  agreement
to be entered into between Eskom and the Government of South  Africa  should
create a healthy business model for governance.  Eskom,  in  its  director's
annual report, foresees that the shareholder  compact  will  give  direction
from the Government as the shareholder as to what is required from Eskom  in
terms of strategic objectives, key policies, and performance parameters  and
targets, which can only improve the performance of Eskom in the future.

The concern of Cosatu that the  taxation  of  Eskom  on  becoming  a  public
company will give rise to severe price increases is  not  relevant.  Eskom's
income status had already changed with effect from 1 January 2000, on  which
day Eskom became liable for income tax. It is not this Bill that  will  make
Eskom a taxpayer.
An  appropriate  tax  framework  for  Eskom's  business  is  already   being
finalised.  The  framework  takes  into  account   Eskom's   electrification
obligation,  the  need  for  stable,  predictable  price  increases  and  an
appropriate dividend policy. Decisions on increasing  the  price  cannot  be
taken unilaterally,  but  must  be  approved  by  the  National  Electricity
Regulator in terms of the Electricity Act of 1987, as the hon  the  Minister
has already mentioned.

There is also an understanding that the Government will put  tax  money  and
dividends from Eskom into an electrification fund in order to  minimise  the
impact of taxation on the price.

In  conclusion,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  Eskom  on  its   HIV/Aids
programme. The  fact  that  Eskom's  HIV/Aids  programme  has  received  two
international awards and one national award is laudable. Undoubtedly,  Eskom
is setting an example for other businesses in the Republic of South  Africa.
The New NP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Iingcebiso ezithe zagqama zezivele kubasebenzi, zivakalisa  uluvo  lwabantu.
Inkulu inxaxheba ethe  yathatyathwa  ngabasebenzi  kulo  Mthetho  usayilwayo
kuba  kaloku  lo  nguRhulumente  wabo,  uyawazi  namalungelo   abo.   Indima
abayidlalileyo  abasebenzi  ekuncedisaneni   nale   komiti   ibonisa   ukuba
ubudlelwane  abubuyi  mva,  bubheka  phambili.  Ayikho  into  ethi  kuba  lo
Rhulumente ekhokelwa yi-ANC, imbumba ye-ANC-SACP-COSATU  iyahexa  xa  abantu
besizisa  izindululo  zabo.  Ayihexi,  iqina  ngakumbi.  Ndingathi   ukuzama
ukuwubeka ngokundilisekileyo lo mba, wonke  ubani  uyazi  ukuba  uRhulumente
uba nemigaqonkqubo yakhe, nabasebenzi  ngokunjalo.  Ukuba  le  migaqo-nkqubo
ibiya kuvumela yonke into, ngesingenaye lo Rhulumente.

Into endizama ukuyithetha yeyokuba kwiingcebiso  nezilungiso  eziphakanyiswe
yiCosatu, ezintandathu kwezisibhozo sivumelene ngazo. Ezo sithe  asavumelana
ngazo asizikhabanga. Xa besinokwenza njalo  besiya  kuba  siphuma  endleleni
kwiinkqubo  zikaRhulumente.  Le  nto  ndiyithethiswa  kukuba  sele   etshilo
uMphathiswa ukuba kaloku ikho  imithetho  esayilwayo  enobucukubhede.  Ukuba
singavumelana ngayo yonke into, noko siya kuba asikwazi  kuyijonga  imigaqo-
nkqubo kaRhulumente. (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Ms B N DLULANE: Chairperson of  the  National  Council  of  Provinces,  hon
Ministers and their deputies, and hon members, it is an honour for me to  be
given this  opportunity  to  participate  in  the  debate  about  the  Eskom
Conversion Bill. Without the loss of heroes and  heroines  such  as  Lillian
Ngoyi, Griffiths Mxenge, Hector Peterson,  Chris  Hani,  Oliver  Tambo,  and
others, we would never have had this opportunity of  participating  in  such
interesting debates in  this  House,  especially  when  we  have  to  assist
formulators of laws that affect poor people.

It was not easy to reach these agreements as citizens of  South  Africa  and
members of Parliament. I speak as a South African citizen as well as an  ANC
member. We  were  faced  with  an  enormous  task  of  evaluating  the  many
suggestions  that  came  from  the   public   in   general   and   community
organisations. This I say because I want them to know that  we  did  provide
an opportunity for people's proposals as the Government of the people.  They
responded well and expressed their views and needs.

The suggestions that were prominent came  from  workers.  Workers  played  a
vital role in the formulation of this Bill  because  this  Government  knows
what their rights are. The role  that  workers  and  this  committee  played
shows clearly that the relationship is becoming even stronger.  When  people
are dissatisfied about something and are making proposals, that  should  not
suggest that the alliance of the ANC, SACP and  Cosatu  is  threatened.  The
relationship should not be taken as unstable at all; instead it is  becoming
even stronger. To put it appropriately, everybody knows that Government  has
certain policies and so  do  workers.  If  such  policies  would  allow  for
everything, there would be no reason to have this Government.

The point I am trying to make is that we agreed with Cosatu on  six  out  of
eight suggestions and amendments they had.  The  ones  we  could  not  reach
consensus on were not necessarily removed from  the  discussion  table.  Any
such action would be against the policies  of  Government.  This  I  mention
because the Minister has already indicated that there are other  Bills  that
are being formulated. If we could agree  on  everything,  we  would  not  be
going according to Government policies.]

One of the two amendments Cosatu has proposed is  that  a  clause  be  added
which instructs Cabinet before it takes a  decision  to  dispose  any  Eskom
shares that such a decision should go to Parliament.

Njengoko bese nditshilo, zikhona kaloku izinto esingenakuzityeshela  singala
malungu eNdlu, ekufuneka sigxinisise kuzo. [As  I  said  earlier  there  are
important things that we could not just ignore as members.]

Following  a  discussion  with  them,  a  compromise  was  proposed  by  the
Department of Public Enterprises which proposes that should Cabinet  dispose
of Eskom shares, it has to publish such intentions in the Gazette  and  call
for public hearings.

Le  nto  ndiyithethiswa  kuba  ndifuna  beve  phaya  emakhaya,  kuba  kaloku
kufuneka  bazi  ukuba   siyaphulaphula   singuRhulumente   wabantu.   Khange
singayiphulaphuli loo nto, kodwa sinenkqubo esiqhuba ngayo. [I mention  this
because I want those at home to hear it, for they should  know  that  we  do
listen, as the Government of the people. We never ignored them, but we  want
them to know that we do things according to a set procedure.]

I would like to make it clear that the Bill, as it stands without these  two
proposals, does take care of Cosatu's concern, in that it is stated  in  the
Bill that Government is the sole shareholder of Eskom.

Akwaba bekunokuthi kanti bamamele abasebenzi phaya phandle. [I so wish  that
workers were listening out there.]

This  means  that  if  Cabinet,  in  the  future,  decides  to  change   the
shareholder arrangement, it has to go to Parliament to amend the Bill.

Uqala apho ke umsebenzi wethu  singamalungu  ka-ANC  abekwe  apha.  Kufuneka
sijonge ukuba asinxaxhi na kwiinkqubo zePalamente  esizinikiweyo.  [Our  job
as members of the ANC who were voted to this  Government  starts  there.  We
should guard against not following the rules that Government set.]

The proposal that this intention be put in the  Gazette  and  the  call  for
public hearings will be done through committee procedures in Parliament.

Njengokuba bebonile, abasebenzi  okokuqala  kwimbali  yeli  lizwe,  bebesiza
njengaye wonke  umntu  bagcwalise  kwizindlu  esixoxela  kuzo.  Likhona  elo
thuba, livuliwe ngulo  Rhulumente  wabantu.  [For  the  first  time  in  the
history of this country, workers could come and fill up seats in the  houses
where debates would be carrying on.]

In terms of the processes which Cosatu has brought about, these  submissions
will be opened again. This means that  the  concerns  of  Cosatu  have  been
taken care of through parliamentary processes. The fact that this Bill  will
convert Eskom from a statutory juristic body into a public  company,  having
share capital, means that parity will be brought  about  between  Eskom  and
all other state-owned entities, especially in terms  of  tax  and  dividends
payments  to  the  state,  to  enable  Government  to  achieve  its   social
objectives, such as providing water and electricity to the poor.  This  Bill
also ensures that Eskom observes and is run in terms of a  protocol  on  co-
operative governance.

Ndibulela  onke  amalungu  emibutho   athabatha   inxaxheba   kule   ngxoxo.
Mandibabulele  abahlali-ngaphambili  beekmiti  zeziNdlu  zombini.  Akukhange
kube lula. Mandingalibali ukubulela isebe kwakunye noMphathiswa, kunye  naye
wonke, ubani ebesisebenza naye. Namhlanje sigqiba  kwelokuba  siyawuvuma  lo
Mthetho usayilwayo. [I would like to thank members of all parties that  took
part in this debate.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  chairpersons  of
committees of both Houses. It was not easy. I will not forget to  thank  the
Department and the Minister as well as everybody that  we  worked  with.  We
have decided to accept this Bill today.]
Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, hon Minister  and  members,  the  Eskom  Conversion
Bill puts an interesting spotlight on the growing difference,  not  only  of
economics, but also of ethical choice arising  between  the  Government,  on
the one hand, and trade unions on the other. Is privatisation a panacea  for
economic growth and opportunity, or is it a process causing job  losses  and
a brake on delivery for the poor?

The  fundamental  choice  addressed  by  politicians  is  deciding  on   the
allocation of scarce resources according to the preferences  of  society.  I
cannot put it in such Machiavellian terms  as  my  chairperson  did.  Cosatu
still seems to believe that a command  economy  can  deliver  an  acceptable
standard of living in a global economy, while Government has  realised  that
this can only be achieved by economic growth  in  which  private  enterprise
and competition play a definitive role.

The ethical question is the more interesting one. Are we here  as  guardians
of the employed, or are we  here  to  expand  opportunities  to  the  heart-
numbing number of people who do not have jobs, who do not  get  retrenchment
packages and who have not had on-the-job training?
These fundamental choices must be  made,  and  the  Government  has  chosen,
quite clearly on the economic issue, privatisation as  the  path  to  growth
and opportunity. Cosatu, on the other hand, is harking back  to  an  era  of
international as well as national social engineering not for lack  of  moral
vision, but for misguided notions of economic principles and  the  needs  of
human nature. I do question their morals when strike action is their  choice
of response to a heavily and democratically debated issue. It  is  difficult
to see whose agenda is served by such contemplated action.

Such confrontation could possibly be avoided  if  Government  would  address
the issue of privatisation in a more forthright manner than they  have  done
to date or, I dare say, like it was done today by the Minister.  No  sleight
of hand will hide the fact that  this  Bill,  which  changes  Eskom  from  a
statutory commission to a shareholder-owned energy  company,  is,  in  fact,
the first step to an inevitable sale of shares to the public.

This will not  be  hidden  by  the  voted  removal  of  clause  3  from  the
memorandum  of  the  Bill  on  the  flimsy  excuse  that  the  paragraph  is
confusing. One may judge for oneself. It reads as follows:


  The benefit to the country of the unbundling of Eskom is that in the long
  run Eskom might decide to draw on the benefits  of  listing  on  a  stock
  exchange and, in that event, citizens and foreigners alike, will be in  a
  position to acquire shares in Eskom. Eskom can  only  be  listed  on  the
  stock exchange if it is a company and Government is  preparing  for  that
  eventuality, should it arise.

Having due regard for both its stated and unstated aims,  the  DP  therefore
votes with the Government in support of this Bill. [Applause.]

Nkk J N VILAKAZI: Sihlalo ohloniphekileyo nomhlonishwa  uNgqongqoshe  okhona
phakathi  kwethu  kanye  neNdlu  yonke,  iqembu   lami   le-IFP   liwusekela
ngokugcwele umThetho osezithebeni okuthiwa yi-Eskom Conversion Bill - B  16B
- 2001 - ingaphansi kwe sigatshana  $5.  Siyawuthanda  sonke  u-Eskom  ngoba
usilethela ugesi esiwudingayo ezmpilweni zethu.

UHulumeni  wethu  ubonile  ukuthi  ukuze   umphakathi   uthuthuke   ngezinga
eliphezulu,  makanikeze  u-Eskom  ilungelo  elithe  xaxa  ekuphatheni  ukuze
impilo  yabantu,  umnotho  wezwe  kanye  nenhlalo  jikelele  ibe   sezingeni
eliphezulu kuwo wonke umuntu  owakhele  leli  laseNingizimu  Afrika.  Okunye
okuhle ngalo mThetho, ukuzwa ukuthi uHulumeni akaphumile gelekeqe  ku-Eskom,
kodwa unengxenye enkulu ekuphathweni  kwawo.  Lokhu  kuzosiza  kakhulu  labo
abakade benengebhe yokuthi uHulumeni ubabeka  esimeni  esingesihle  ngokuthi
kwenziwe uguquko ekuphatheni. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, our hon Minister and  the  House  at  large,
the IFP fully supports the Bill that is on the Table, which is known as  the
Eskom Conversion Bill - B16B - 2001 - a section 75 Bill. We all  like  Eskom
because it gives us electricity that we need in our lives.

Our Government has realised that in order for our society to  develop  to  a
high level, it must give Eskom an  additional  right  in  managing  people's
lives and the country's economy, and that the welfare of our society  should
be at a high level to benefit everyone who resides in South Africa.  Another
good thing about this Bill is to hear that the Government is not  completely
out of Eskom. It still plays an important role in the  way  it  is  managed.
This helps especially those who have thought that  the  Government  has  put
them in an awkward situation by making changes in the way  this  company  is
managed.]

The IFP supports this proposed Bill,  whose  object  is  the  conversion  of
Eskom into a public company by having a share capital incorporated in  terms
of the Companies Act, Act 61 of 1973. We in the  IFP  hope  that  this  will
definitely bring about more efficiency and competitiveness  in  the  running
of Eskom. The IFP also hopes that exposure of Eskom to  global  trends  will
be effected and will bring many more other privileges which were  not  being
enjoyed by general consumers at large.

The IFP supports the Bill without any reservations. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I have to say  that  we  are  troubled  by  this
Bill. We are uncertain about it, particularly when  Prince  Machiavelli  and
Malcolm X are quoted in support of the legislation. [Laughter.]

We are normally enthusiastic supporters of privatisation  or  public-private
partnerships or any steps to make service providers  more  efficient  or  to
reduce costs. But this is the exception that proves the rule, and I  believe
that we need to be careful. I have to tell the hon the Minister that we  are
not even sure who owns Eskom. The state has never financed Eskom. Eskom  was
founded for and financed by the consumers that have used the  services  that
it provided. If there are shares to be given out, I think that  they  should
be given to the consumers who are the rightful owners of the corporation.

Eskom is one of the oldest, largest and one of  the  most  successful  power
supply companies in the world, and it has been and remains  central  to  the
development  of  the  regional  economy  and   the   improvement   of   life
circumstances of all our people.

The Government proudly announces,  justifiably,  every  year  how  many  new
homes have been connected. From our own energy sources  -  coal,  water  and
uranium - it generates, I believe, the  second  lowest  power  cost  in  the
world. This has given us low-cost electrified  transport  and  has  fostered
the mining and manufacturing industry in South Africa and the region.

We believe taking this step in the possible direction  of  the  break-up  of
Eskom is a retrograde step. It is possibly the right  thing  to  do  at  the
wrong time in our development history.

Aside from anything else, cheap power has  kept  our  mines  in  production,
particularly marginal mines. It has made the aluminium smelters of  Richards
Bay and Maputo possible. Our rail transport system has  been  shielded  from
oil price increases; we have been able to electrify  our  homes  on  a  huge
scale and we have, through the grid, been able to extend  the  benefits  and
the energy economies of scale to our neighbours in the region. In  short,  I
would like to know whether we have, in fact,  consulted  our  neighbours  in
the region, because these steps could affect them very seriously.

In short, it has been a neutral power source for the  good  of  everyone  in
the region. Local authorities will also be able to buy wholesale power  from
Eskom and retail the power to the consumers, thereby providing a  source  of
funding for local authorities.

We have so much that we want and need to change in South Africa. Let us  not
try and fix something which ``ain't broke'', as  the  Americans  would  say.
Something is working well. We believe that we  should  be  cautious  and  be
very sure before we make a move in that direction.

The object of privatisation or restructuring is to  improve  efficiency  and
in Eskom we already have high levels of efficiency  with  low  tarifs  in  a
self-financing organisation that does not call  upon  the  scarce  resources
and has never had problems in funding itself.

The Bill, as a whole, will have an impact on the SADC region. I  would  like
to tell the hon the Minister that those  are  thoughts  that  are  sincerely
given. I hope that our reservations are proved to be  unfounded  and  wrong.
But under these circumstances, my party opposes the legislation

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson,  it  is  very  interesting  that  the  ACDP,  and
particularly Mr Kent Durr, would oppose the legislation  when  he  has  been
one of the people who had consistently, over time,  ignored  completely  the
request of welfare monopolies  and  so  forth  that  have  existed  in  this
country. I am truly amazed.

That demonstrates something. With a Bill like this, we  can  have  ostriches
that will put their heads in the sand, on the one end hand, and  those  that
put their heads above the sand on the other hand. The truth  of  the  matter
is that there is a middle road to walk when one is on the road to  democracy
and development in this country. That seems to be what is eluding  everybody
in these debates.  The  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  Mr  Durr  needs  to
understand that, regardless of the efficiency of Eskom, there  is  a  global
onslaught on our economy. There are multinational energy organisations  that
are operating on this continent and they are marching at  a  speed  that  we
cannot imagine.

If we do not modernise our public corporations  and  utilities  and  do  not
enter the global area in trading vigorously and viciously, we are  going  to
lose markets and we are also going to ensure that we lose our  own  edge  in
this country. This fantastic Eskom that Mr Durr talks about would not be  so
fantastic if, on the one end of the spectrum, we buried  our  heads  in  the
sand.
Let us go to the other end of  the  spectrum.  Sandra  Botha  questions  the
morals of Cosatu and  others  for  opposing  this  Bill,  because  they  are
concerned about privatisation. Once again, it is a  case  of  burying  one's
head in the sand. What we are building  in  this  democracy  is  engagement,
transparency and discourse. We  expect  organisations  such  as  Cosatu  and
civil society to examine the processes that  Government  undertakes  and  to
challenge every single process, so that  when  we  finally  embark  on  that
process, we understand that it is for  the  good  of  the  country  and  the
people of South Africa.

It is good that Cosatu goes on strike. We have not come from a history  like
the apartheid history, which is the history of the  allies  of  the  DP,  in
which  we  bludgeon  protest  and  disagreement.  It  is   all   right   for
organisations such as Cosatu, which is  inside  the  ANC-alliance,  or  even
those from outside, to come and say that they have some real and  legitimate
concerns about the delivery of services to  our  people,  the  extension  of
energy to the rural areas, the efficiency with which we do so and so  forth.
It is all right for Cosatu to say that the electorate needs to be  consulted
before one privatises some of the state's utilities. It  is  all  right  for
Government to say that we will do so, but that we  are  not  going  to  stop
going forward on the path of modernisation.

At the end of the day, as Government we have something  simple  to  deliver.
We have to deliver this economy and the whole  process  in  Southern  Africa
into the global economy for one purpose only, and that is to  alleviate  the
poverty of our people and to make sure that we take all those processes  and
those dinosaurs such as Eskom in its structure as a statutory body,  into  a
modern and  more efficient world. From that point of view I want to  commend
the Minister and the department for having  allowed  organisations  such  as
Cosatu and the newspapers to  engage  Government  in  a  transparent  debate
about where are we taking public utilities  such as Eskom, which is,  as  we
all agree, a welfare monopoly in many ways.

Eskom, as Mama  Vilakazi  said,  is  not  an  independent  organisation.  It
delivers some very important things to  our  people  and  we  expect  it  to
continue delivering those things to our people over time. However, in  doing
so we cannot bury our heads in the sand. The department,  the  Minister  and
others have engaged our country on  the  issues.  They  have  indicated  the
options.
We can leave Eskom as it is, and lose the edge in the marketplace or have  a
situation in which other multinational corporations and  energy  players  in
the international field come and play on our turf. We will not  be  able  to
take this corporation beyond our  borders.  However,  we  can  take  another
option, and that is to modernise this organisation so that we can  meet  the
challenges of the 21st century. That is what the department has been  saying
to us. The department has been saying that to Cosatu and civil society.

It is correct for civil society to  ask  the  questions  such  as:  Is  this
modernisation going to be good for our  people?  Will  it  deliver  us  from
poverty? Is it going to increase prices? Is it going to be used in order  to
privatise, because some of us are members of Cosatu  or  the  SACP  and  may
ideologically feel that we do not want privatisation. That is the  democracy
we have built. Those are the foundations upon which our new  society  rests.
That is what our people have struggled for for so long. From that  point  of
view, I want to once again congratulate the  Minister  and  his  department.
This Bill is a good one, and this House should support it. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES:  Chairperson,  hon  delegates,  let  me
take this opportunity to thank all the political parties who have  supported
the Bill in this debate. There is one issue raised by Mr Durr which  I  want
to highlight very briefly, and that is  the  issue  of  the  involvement  of
stakeholders. All stakeholders, including organised business,  were  invited
to make their inputs and many of them  made  written  submissions  which  we
have taken into account in finalising this Bill.

However, I need to emphasisen one stakeholder on which I need to engage  the
House and the public in  general,  namely  Cosatu.  We  have  had  extensive
consultations with Cosatu on this particular  Bill.  It  started  last  year
when  we  had  engagements  at  a  bilateral   level   between   Government,
represented  by  the  Departments  of  Minerals  and   Energy   and   Public
Enterprises and organised labour. From that time in November  until  now  we
have had no less than 11 meetings with Cosatu, excluding two meetings  which
I have had with the general secretary of Cosatu, Comrade Zwelinzima Vavi.

We have had very robust and engaging bilaterals trying  to  accommodate  all
their concerns. That is why I want to take this opportunity to  indicate  in
precise terms what it is that we  have  incorporated  which  has  come  from
Cosatu. Among others things, on the issue of the object of  the  Bill,  they
have emphasised the issue of the ownership aspect in the Bill  and  we  have
taken that into account. Regarding the issue of the  protection  of  workers
which was highlighted today, we have indicated that this Bill is  not  about
privatisation. It is about converting Eskom from a  statutory  body  into  a
limited liability company. By using this deeming route in  this  conversion,
all the rights and obligations  that  Eskom  had  before  the  incorporation
remain in place. This includes the protection of the  rights  of  all  Eskom
employees, and this is actually contained in the  Bill  inasmuch  as  it  is
stated that this conversion of Eskom  will  not  affect  the  conditions  of
service of employees. Therefore all those workers  and  employees  of  Eskom
should rest assured that this state of affairs is  going  to  continue  even
after this conversion. There is no ideological conversion that is  going  to
occur merely turning Eskom into a limited liability company.

Regarding the issues of public consultation, in terms of the memorandum  and
articles of association and the regulations, those are some  of  the  issues
that we have taken into account. The developmental role  of  Eskom,  as  all
the opposition parties have conceded has, in fact  played  a  very  critical
role in the development process in South Africa. There is no  way  that  the
ANC Government at this hour, seven years into our  democracy,  can  diminish
this developmental role. In fact, we are going to accelerate it so that  all
the targets that we are aiming for are reached.

An important fact that I also want to highlight is this  whole  rolling  out
of  electricity  in  the  rural  areas  of  South  Africa.  Some  have  this
misconception that by converting Eskom  into  a  company  all  those  social
obligations that we had are going to come to  a  stop.  In  fact,  they  are
going to be accelerated, because now we even have what we  call  a  National
Electrification Fund which is located in  the  Department  of  Minerals  and
Energy and which is going  to  use  resources  even  beyond  Eskom  for  the
electrification of the rural areas of our country.

I therefore want to assure delegates and the public in general that this  is
good for South Africa and  for  Eskom.  This  is  also  good  for  organised
labour, because it will ensure that Eskom survives into the future and  that
it does not only end up here in South  Africa,  but  also  goes  beyond  the
borders  of  the  Republic,  championing  and   implementing   the   African
Renaissance that  our  President  Thabo  Mbeki  is  pursuing  together  with
President Bouteflika of Algeria and President Obasanjo of Nigeria.

I thank  hon  members  for  having  supported  this  Bill.  Aluta  continua!
[Applause.]

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 12 - Statistics South Africa:

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  I  do  not  see  the
Minister in the Chamber.

The CHIEF  WHIP  OF  THE  COUNCIL:  Chairperson,  there  has  been  a  small
difficulty. The Minister is on his way here. May I ask that we proceed  with
the speakers' list and allow Ms Mahlangu,  the  chairperson  of  the  Select
Committee on Finance, to speak now.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Does the  House  agree
to that? The hon member may continue.

Ms Q D  MAHLANGU:  Mr  Chairperson,  I  am  not  a  Minister,  by  the  way.
[Interjections.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Why are you wearing a T-shirt in the House?

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: May I just explain why I am wearing a T-shirt? Members  are
harassing me because they want to know why I am wearing this T-shirt.  I  am
sure we all know and understand that today we are discussing Budget Vote  No
12, Statistics South Africa. This T-shirt signifies  that  we  must  all  be
counted in Census 2001, which takes place from 10 to 31 October.

Mr M V MOOSA: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: In terms of the rules  of
the Chamber, no member  is  allowed  to  wear  clothing  unbecoming  to  the
decorum of the House, and that  includes  T-shirts  and  sandshoes  such  as
takkies. [Laughter.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): You are out of  order,
hon member.

Mr M V MOOSA: If this hon member is allowed to do that, Chairperson,  it  is
wrong.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): You are out of  order,
hon member. [Laughter.] The hon member Ms Mahlangu may proceed.

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, on a more serious note, I just want  to  raise
something which is of serious concern to me as an  individual  and,  in  the
first place, in my capacity as a South African citizen. As  the  chairperson
of the select committee, I must point out that  we  only  have  about  three
provinces participating in this debate today, including  mine.  To  me  that
says a lot about how people in this country regard a  debate  on  a  subject
such as  statistics.  I  believe  provinces  and  everyone  else,  including
ordinary citizens, should begin to take statistics as a serious issue.

I want to preface my input with a quotation  from  this  book,  which  is  a
survey done by the World Bank on many developing  countries.  It  refers  to
the following:


  The absence of bread and the  necessity  to  send  the  children  to  the
  neighbour, since they had already gone to ask  for  bread  several  times
  before and hesitated to go again.


  The relative who died in hospital because they could not buy the required
  medicine in time.


  Their children had forgotten the taste of sugar and meat.
  Their children could not go to school due to the absence of  clothes  and
  shoes.

I am reading this in an attempt to demonstrate the role  and  importance  of
statistics in improving the lives of the people that  I  have  been  talking
about.

The important role of Statistics SA  in  economic  policy-making  is  seldom
understood  and  appreciated.  The  formulation  of  economic  policy,  both
monetary and fiscal, is Statistics SA-intensive, meaning that  monetary  and
fiscal policy is statistical information-intensive.

Statistics SA produces the consumer price  index,  popularly  known  as  the
CPI, on a monthly basis.  The  consumer  price  index  is  used  to  measure
inflation. In addition, Statistics SA had to  redesign  its  consumer  price
index when inflation targeting was introduced in South  Africa  in  February
2000.

I also want to indicate that this variation was chosen because  the  overall
headline consumer price index is  directly  influenced  by  changes  in  the
Reserve Bank's monetary policy. A relaxation in  monetary  policy  leads  to
lower interest rates in general, including mortgage  interest  costs,  which
affect the bond that one pays every month. This, in  turn,  leads  to  lower
measured inflation. However, the converse is not actually true.  Conversely,
when the monetary policy is tightened in  order  to  reduce  inflation,  the
mortgage rates do not drop, resulting in inflation through  higher  mortgage
rates.

To overcome this problem, Statistics SA, together  with  the  Reserve  Bank,
had to remove mortgage interest costs from  the  consumer  price  index  for
inflation targeting purposes.
I also want to deal with the division of revenue and how it is  affected  by
the statistics collected from time to time, in particular the coming  Census
2001  and  the  previous  Census  1996,  in  which   some   provinces   were
disadvantaged, or so they say, because resource allocations  were  based  on
figures that were not necessarily accurate. Hopefully, the statistics to  be
collected this year will improve such conditions.

It was indicated to members of the committee that  some  provinces  that  we
visited recently border on other countries,  in  particular  Mozambique  and
Swaziland in relation to Mpumalanga. Between South Africa, or  the  province
of Mpumalanga specifically, and Swaziland, one cannot  tell  the  difference
between a Swazi and a South African citizen. They both speak  Swazi.  It  is
therefore very difficult to provide services. In this instance,  it  affects
the provision of services, especially  to  South  Africans  who  need  those
services. The Free State, the Northern  Province  and  all  other  provinces
bordering on foreign countries are also affected.

Now I come to  the  role  of  household  surveys,  which  are  conducted  as
frequently as possible. It is important for all of  us  to  co-operate  with
such surveys, but  the  people  concerned  should  also  be  asked  relevant
questions which inform the policy-making processes, because if we  have  the
correct data and collect the correct statistics, we will  be  able  to  make
correct policy choices and therefore allocate resources adequately.

Collaboration between Statistics SA and  other  institutions,  such  as  the
CSIR and the HSRC, is very important. We would like to see  this  continuing
from time to time if  it  is  not  happening  often  enough.  We  have  been
informed that it does happen occasionally, but we would appreciate it if  it
happened frequently.

In this regard I also want to highlight the readiness of  provinces.  In  my
understanding, only one province has pronounced  its  readiness  for  Census
2001. Unfortunately it is the Western Cape,  but  their  readiness  is  more
than welcome in this instance. I would like to call upon  all  provinces  to
make sure that they are ready for  Census  2001  and,  in  particular,  that
people are able to co-operate with the  enumerators  who  are  going  to  be
collecting the statistics.

I want to commend Statistics SA for the training programmes that  they  have
come up  with,  in  particular  those  aimed  at  training  more  people  in
mathematics, so that we can gain  the  skills  that  we  dearly  need  as  a
country. I think  this  is  in  line  with  the  medium-term  budget  policy
statement, in which Government's priorities are outlined.  One  of  them  is
human capital development. This is in accordance with that and is  applauded
by the committee.

I think there is also a need for us to concentrate on the  informal  sector,
because from time to time  Cosatu  and  other  stakeholders  have  contested
figures or information released by the Reserve Bank around the  increase  of
employment, in particular, as a consequence of the increase  in  the  number
of people in the informal sector. I think if we could get correct  data  and
relevant information around the question of unemployment in our country,  in
particular, we would be able to  know  whether  we  are  making  headway  or
regressing as a country.

I also just want to express appreciation for the help that other  countries,
such as Australia, Canada and Sweden, are giving  us  regarding  statistics.
Some  of  these  countries  helped  us  while  we  were  struggling  against
apartheid, when the statistics that we had then favoured  the  interests  of
the minority, as opposed to the majority. I think now we are moving  in  the
right direction.

The last thing that I want to talk about is the SA  Statistics  Council,  as
provided for in the Act. Provinces should utilise these bodies  as  much  as
possible, so that they can be able to raise relevant issues  that  they  are
supposed to raise.

Lastly, I just want to call on members of this  House  and  all  members  of
Parliament to play their role in their respective  constituencies  in  order
to make sure that all South African citizens are counted, not for  the  sake
of being counted, but for the sake of informing  policy-making  choices  and
relevant allocation of resources. ``Masibalwe sonke,'' ``ri  balwe  rohle.''
[Let us all be counted.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! I  welcome  the
hon the Deputy Minister and call upon him to introduce the  debate,  because
we have not started debating.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): There  is  no  debate,
Chief Whip. The Minister must introduce the debate.

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  OF  FINANCE:  Chairperson,  we  had  already  arranged
differently, and that was that I would come in at the end. But if the  Chair
rules that I should open the debate, I will do so.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Yes,  otherwise  there
is no debate. We need somebody to  introduce  the  debate.  [Interjections.]
You just put the question on your Budget Vote, so that we have a debate.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: So you would like me to  formally  open  the
debate.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Yes, there must  be  a
debate.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  members,  I  must
first apologise that the House had  to  begin  the  debate  before  I  could
arrive.

In the past year our President has presented us with a vision  for  economic
recovery in Africa. This vision  rests  on  the  foundations  of  democratic
governance. It emphasises sound and sustainable economic policies.  It  puts
the needs of the poor first.

In view of the message about democratic governance that our  President  took
to the British  government  last  week,  this  House  should  note  our  own
substantial commitment to the development of our  region  and  continent.  I
would like to focus on how some of these commitments relate to this  vision.


This Government has a vision for a better life for all.  This  ideal  should
not be lost as we move  towards  globalisation  and  increasing  competition
with other countries. The commitment to improve life circumstances  for  all
should be underpinned by timely, accurate and reliable official  statistics.
Statistics SA is in line with Government policy. It is compliant  with  SADC
protocols and it is meeting its  international  obligations  of  integration
into the regional and world economy.

The apartheid era saw a fragmentation of the statistical  system,  resulting
in poor quality statistics designed to support the interests of  a  minority
rather than providing an  accurate  picture  of  the  social,  economic  and
demographic situation of all of South Africa's people.

The quest for best statistical practice has, within a very short  period  of
time, made an impact. We are pleased to report that in May this  year  South
Africa was elected a member  of  the  UN  Statistics  Commission.  We  will,
accordingly, be giving statistical advice to  the  UN  Social  and  Economic
Commission, which meets  annually  to  review  how  well  the  international
community is served by statistical systems.

Regionally we have done well in terms of being a focal point  for  the  SADC
2000-01 round of censuses. The point about this is that there are  a  number
of countries in the SADC region that have been holding  censuses  from  last
year until this year. What we have sought to do is to  try  and  co-ordinate
our approach to all of these  censuses  so  that  we  can  really  create  a
regional statistical database.

We have contributed to the efforts of the SADC secretariats  in  marshalling
both  intellectual  and  material   resources   for   the   harmonising   of
measurements relating to demographics and economics. We have also taken  the
lead in time-use  studies,  which,  among  other  issues,  highlight  unpaid
female labour. We shall be sharing these important findings  nationally  and
with SADC shortly. This is something in which I think we should take  a  lot
of interest, because there is, indeed, in many countries  a  lot  of  labour
which is not taken into account when the size of an  economy  or  the  goods
and services that are produced in an economy are calculated.

In 1996 we subscribed to the IMF's Special  Data  Dissemination  standard  -
SDDS. This is a very strict data integrity requirement  for  member  states.
It is meant to improve the effectiveness of the fund's surveillance  system.
The  SDDS  is  also  meant  to  inform  sound  macroeconomic  policies.  The
improvement of information flow facilitates confidence in our own  financial
markets. South Africa is the only African country to have subscribed to  the
SDDS and one of the very few countries to have  fully  complied  within  the
set timeframe.

A massive revitalisation of official statistics  took  place  from  1995  to
date. A key element which came to the fore  was  an  increase  in  both  the
number and the quality of statistical products. Entire  sets  of  statistics
have been re-engineered to ensure compliance with the SDDS.

In keeping with our  commitment  to  transparency  and  adherence  to  these
international standards, we have agreed to an  assessment  of  our  economic
and financial data, which has  resulted  in  a  preliminary  IMF  report  on
observance  of  standards  and  codes.  In  addition   to   validating   the
statistical standards with which we comply,  this  report  will  assist  the
Treasury, Statistics SA and the Reserve Bank in identifying  priorities  for
further improvement.

We also boldly subjected ourselves to further scrutiny by  accepting  to  be
part of a pilot exercise  of  the  IMF  and  the  World  Bank,  under  their
Financial Sector Assessment Programme - FSAP - in 1998.  Since  1998,  three
FSAPs have been produced, all of which confirm a general  soundness  of  the
financial system, and which have seen no risks to macroeconomic stability.

Statistics SA entered into a wide range  of  collaborative  activities  with
other departments, which ranged from the construction of a national  spatial
database to user-driven  household  surveys,  and  a  census  that  provides
provincial  breakdowns  of  social  and  economic  characteristics  of   our
population.

Another noteworthy crosscutting initiative has  been  the  creation  of  the
business  register  infrastructure,  developed  together  with  the  revenue
service, to facilitate a better sampling frame.

These efforts culminated in the passing of a new  Statistics  Act  in  1999.
Subsequently, Statistics SA was  given  full  departmental  status  and  the
appointment of a Statistician-General was made  in  January  this  year.  In
that regard, I would like to introduce to the House  the  new  Statistician-
General, Mr Padi Lehohla, who  many  will  remember  was  heading  the  1996
census effort.

The benefits of these developments have been in the deepening of  democracy.
The  demarcation  board,  in  their   delimitation   of   local   government
boundaries, to a large extent, applied the data from the  census  and  other
surveys conducted by  Statistics  SA.   Although  not  exclusively  so,  the
allocation of budgets is driven by the population numbers, particularly  our
indigent policies.

Despite these achievements, there is a need to review  the  outputs  of  the
organisation in greater detail. Our commitment to transparency demands  that
we test these in  terms  of  their  veracity  and  robustness,  methodology,
quality and relevance. In this vein, the new statistics  council,  which  is
the watchdog of the output of the system, has put up an ambitious  programme
of reviews of Statistics SA products and data,  and  has  started  with  the
labour statistics series.

Statistics SA's quest for providing a broad  range  of  sustainable  quality
statistics is underpinned by the  need  and  justification  for  creating  a
national statistics system. There are three  main  considerations  that  can
impact negatively  when  such  a  system  does  not  exist  or  when  it  is
ineffective.
The first is the financial and quality implications of a system based  on  a
model that has stand-alone silos and duplicates measurements  across  themes
and silos. The second is the political cost of failing to report  accurately
and timeously and, therefore, failing to  manage  and  be  accountable.  The
third is the cost of making inappropriate policy decisions due to  a  dearth
of cohesive data.

The national statistical system aims to enhance the capacity  of  the  state
to formulate and evaluate policy decisions based on appropriate and  quality
data. This will be achieved through the creation of  an  integrated  network
of state institutions.  To  this  end,  we  will  improve  on  the  existing
relations and infrastructure in the provinces.
Researchers and policy-makers in a range of Government  departments  are  to
be jointly  trained  under  the  auspices  of  SAMDI,  in  conjunction  with
Statistics SA, to enhance the usage of statistics. In this  regard,  we  are
exploring the creation of an institution in South Africa that will train  in
official statistics.

Many members may not know that there is no institution in South Africa  that
teaches in official statistics. In  the  meantime,  therefore,  arrangements
for the training of our staff in official  statistics  are  at  an  advanced
stage in partnership with other reputable  regional  institutions,  such  as
the Institute of Statistics and Applied  Economics  at  Makerere  University
and the East African Statistical  Training  Centre  in  Tanzania.  If  these
countries contributed to South Africa in military training during our  fight
for  freedom  in  the  past,  this  time  around  they  will  contribute  in
statistical training for social development.  Achieving  economic  literacy,
which  is  a  passion  of  the  President,  is  predicated  upon   achieving
statistical literacy.

Statistics SA will continue to engage in a series of activities  to  improve
its statistical collections during the financial year 2001-02. To this  end,
Statistics SA will meet the preconditions to the successful  collection  and
dissemination of  statistics,  namely  compiling  a  regularly  updated  and
comprehensive business register and conducting a well-run population  census
for providing the basic tools for drawing samples.

Now I would like to turn to Census  2001.  An  immediate  challenge  to  the
organisation is the mounting of the second census of  the  population  under
democratic rule. The Minister of  Finance  launched  this  in  the  National
Assembly recently as part of a  massive  campaign  calling  on  citizens  to
participate. Launches have been made  by  premiers  in  seven  provinces  to
date. The eighth is taking place  in  Gauteng  tomorrow.  I  wish  to  thank
premiers for having taken this task in the spirit it commands.

The CensusAtSchool project, a joint initiative  between  the  Department  of
Education and Statistics SA, is being  implemented  successfully  throughout
the provincial administrations.  The  objective  of  this  operation  is  to
promote awareness amongst the public about, firstly, the forthcoming  census
and,  more  importantly,  as  a   significant   step   towards   entrenching
statistical literacy in society.

Census 2001, besides providing information for  bench-marking  progress  and
identifying areas that require further development,  marks  a  big  leap  in
terms of technological innovation that will  benefit  the  broader  society.
With the geographic information system toolkit, we will be  able  to  easily
access and visualise data on the state of affairs in our constituencies.

Through  Census  2001,  we  are  introducing  new  technology  by   scanning
documents or questionnaires on a grand scale. The benefits  of  this  system
are being explored favourably for all paper-based processing  in  Statistics
SA. This has also been offered to the Revenue Service and Home Affairs.
I think that I should stop here. Perhaps one  can  allude  to  some  of  the
issues that I have in  the  prepared  speech  at  the  end  of  the  debate.
[Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister of Finance  and  colleagues,
an author by the name of Rex Stout once said that there  are  two  kinds  of
statistics, namely the kind that one looks up and the kind  that  one  makes
up.

Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, the  creator  of  the  storybook
characters Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, went  even  a  step  further  by
declaring:


  There are three kinds of lies, namely lies, damned lies and statistics.

This illustrates the disdain  with  which  some  people,  and  even  learned
people at that, have treated the subject of  statistics  over  the  decades.
Perhaps they did not have sufficient understanding of the  subject  and  did
not know how to interpret statistics, or they  knew  something  that  we  do
not.

Be that as it may, the fact that I mention this does not mean that I or  the
hon members of this  august  House  harbour  the  same  negative  sentiments
towards a highly scientific, respected and specialised discipline.

Ek noem statistiek 'n hoogs  gerespekteerde  en  spesialis  dissipline  want
hoewel ander intellektuele van die minder eksakte dissiplines geneig  is  om
afbrekend teenoor die onderwerp  te  wees,  weet  ons  dat  in  die  moderne
geglobaliseerde wÃªreld waarin ons leef, ons nie sonder tydige,  akkurate  en
toeganklike   amptelike    statistiek    sinvolle,    verantwoordelike    en
verantwoordbare besluite kan neem nie.

Daar is  feitlik  nie  'n  staatsdepartement  in  Suid-Afrika  wat  nie  die
strategiese beplanning en evaluering van sy werksaamhede  op  Ã²f  ekonomiese
Ã²f sosiale Ã²f demografiese statistiek  grond  nie.  As  hulle  nie  van  diÃ©
waardevolle instrument gebruik maak nie, tas hulle in  die  donker  en  trap
hulle klei.

'n Paar interessante en ongetwyfeld  bruikbare  syfers  wat  uit  die  1996-
sensus blyk, is onder meer dat die totale bevolking van Suid-Afrika  in  diÃ©
stadium 40,6 miljoen siele getel het; dat KwaZulu-Natal die  grootste  deel,
naamlik 20,7%, en die Noord-Kaap die kleinste deel, naamlik  2,1%,  van  die
bevolking verteenwoordig het; dat die vroulike geslag die mansgeslag met  'n
kortkop van 51,9% teenoor 48,1% geklop het; dat slegs die  helfte  van  alle
Suid-Afrikaanse huishoudings chemiese of spoeltoilette  gehad  het;  en  dat
44,7% van alle huishoudings lopende water binne-in die  huis  gehad  het  en
58,1% elektrisiteit vir beligting gebruik het.

Die diens wat deur Statistiek Suid-Afrika gelewer word, is  onontbeerlik  en
diÃ© instansie verdien ongetwyfeld al die waardering en ondersteuning wat  hy
van diÃ© Huis kan kry.  Daarom  doen  ek  graag  vandag  'n  beroep  op  alle
verantwoordelike en  patriotiese  Suid-Afrikaners  om  hul  volle  steun  en
samewerking te gee aan Sensus 2001 wat vanjaar van 10  tot  31  Oktober  sal
plaasvind. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I am calling  statistics  a  highly  respected  and  specialist  discipline
because, although other intellectuals in  the  less  exact  disciplines  are
inclined to be negative towards this subject, we know  that  in  the  modern
and globalised world we live in we cannot  take  sensible,  responsible  and
justified  decisions  without  timeous,  accurate  and  accessible  official
statistics.

There is practically no state department in South Africa that does not  base
the strategic planning and  evaluation  of  its  activities  on  economical,
social or demographic statistics. If  they  do  not  utilise  this  valuable
instrument, they are groping in the dark and do not know which way to turn.

A few interesting and undoubtedly  useful  figures  evident  from  the  1996
census are, inter alia, that at that stage South Africa's  total  population
numbered 40,6 million souls;  that  KwaZulu-Natal  represented  the  largest
section, namely 20,7%, and the Northern Cape the  smallest  section,  namely
2,1%, of the population; that the female gender beat the male  gender  by  a
small margin of 51,9% as opposed to 48,1%; that only half of  all  of  South
Africa's households had chemical or flush toilets; and  that  44,7%  of  all
households had running water inside the home and 58,1% used electricity  for
lighting.
The service that is rendered by Statistics South  Africa  is  essential  and
this body undoubtedly deserves all the appreciation and support that it  can
get from this House. That is why  today  I  would  like  to  appeal  to  all
responsible and patriotic South Africans to lend their full support and  co-
operation to Census 2001, which this year will take  place  from  10  to  31
October. [Applause.]]

Mr J MAKGATHO (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, I am  not  sure  how  to  address
you, because the last time I looked up, the Deputy Chairperson  was  in  the
Chair. You are probably Chair of Chairs.

I am entering this debate with  some  confusion  in  my  mind,  because  the
Premier of the Eastern Cape once stated in the House that Census 1996  could
never have been accurate in the Eastern Cape because  he  was  not  counted.
[Laughter.]

Before I start on  the  Eastern  Cape  submission,  the  other  day  in  the
legislature we had an argument with a senior legal adviser. We were  arguing
about the PFMA. I was questioning something. He gave me an answer, and  then
realised that he did not give me a proper answer. He came to me  after  that
and said that there were three ladies in a balloon. On the ground  they  saw
a dog. They said, ``Where are we?'', shouting to  the  dog.  The  dog  said,
``An hour from town, probably 50km away.'' He said that the information  was
precise, to the point, but it was irrelevant. So the lady who shouted  said,
``That dog must be a lawyer.'' He said, ``How do you know?'' She said,  ``He
gave us precise information, to the point, but we still do  not  know  where
we are.'' [Laughter.]

It  is  irrefutable  that  accurate  and  timeous  statistical   information
constitutes one of the elements  that  form  the  lifeblood  of  the  modern
economy, as well as the Government.

Assumptions made about reliable and accurate information form the  basis  of
proper planning, implementation and monitoring. It is  therefore  imperative
that  more  detailed,  reliable  and  desegregated   information   be   made
available.

As I am making this submission on behalf of the province, I would  say  that
information should be accurate, and it should also be made at a  subnational
level to allow us as provinces to do socioeconomic planning for  development
at provincial level, at district level and at local level.

The reason I  am  making  this  submission  in  this  way  is  to  begin  to
understand that we, as the Eastern  Cape,  appreciate  the  proposed  policy
developments that are made by Statistics SA. However,  we  are  saying  that
information should be given in minute detail. Arguments that  are  going  to
follow will be testimony to this.

We  are  saying  that,  if  we  get  improved,  quality  economic   surveys,
especially given  the  uneconomic  development  in  the  provinces,  without
begrudging those provinces that are better developed ... [Interjections.]  I
will not say. I am not at liberty to say.

There  are  also  poverty  indicators;  the  taking  into  consideration  of
peculiar situations that prevail in different provinces; the  increasing  of
the sample size in rural surveys, and presumably taking  into  consideration
topography. The reason I am raising this is because I come from the  Eastern
Cape. One may want to draw a distinction between the Eastern Cape, which  is
inaccessible in some areas - for instance, if one  takes  Willowvale  -  and
look at another rural area which does not have  the  same  topography;  then
one is able to come up with,  probably,  irrelevant  information.  So  I  am
saying, on behalf of the Eastern Cape,  that  we  need  to  take  that  into
consideration.

It  would  then  be  much  appreciated  if  the  elapsed  time  between  the
collection of the information and the publication  thereof  could  be  taken
into account, given the fact that it is IT, period. We are living in  modern
times when it should be easy to co-ordinate this  information  and  to  make
the information available.

If we look at the division of revenue that  was  quoted  here,  one  of  the
things that is expected of us as provinces  is  the  producing  of  credible
budgets, and no longer including education, health and welfare,  but  adding
infrastructure to them. If one looks at where we need infrastructure in  the
Eastern Cape, it is in what was then the Transkei.  Our  government  in  the
Eastern Cape, especially the  MEC  for  finance,  Enoch  Godongwana,  talked
about what we call the ``Ntloyiya''  syndrome.``  Untloyiya''  is  an  eagle
that tries to catch every chicken, but  ends  up  with  nothing  because  it
wants to do everything at the same time. [Interjections.] So, we are  saying
that for us to plan, we need information.

I use an eagle as an example. If one watches an eagle preying on  a  rodent,
it calculates before it pounces the distance between the animal that  it  is
going to pounce on and the hole. The eagle does not go directly, it goes  in
between that and the hole. That calculation  is  done  because  it  has  the
necessary tools and instruments to be able to do that. So for us to be  able
to plan as  a  province,  we  need  that  reliable,  timeous,  instantaneous
information. In between ...

The  CHAIRPERSON   OF   COMMITTEES:   Hon   member,   your   time   is   up.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr J MAKGATHO: In conclusion, I was going to say: ``Tel ons by.'' [Count  us
in.] Count us in. ``Re bale.'' [Count us in.] We are in. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Madam Chair, hon Deputy Minister,  hon  special  delegates  and
hon colleagues, I started my teaching career  at  the  Stanger  Indian  High
School on the North Coast of Natal, in the early  1960s.  The  town  is  now
called  Kwadukuza.  [Interjections.]  Those  were  the  volatile  years   of
political strife; political persecution and political oppression;  when  the
non-white peoples of South Africa had to run the gauntlet of  the  ferocious
security police of  the  seemingly  invincible  granite  juggernaut  of  the
Verwoerd regime;  with  the  draconian  laws  of  apartheid  and  of  racial
discrimination, group  areas;  separate  but  unequal  facilities  -  almost
always inadequate; and when the dignity of ...

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson is it parliamentary for the hon  member  to  talk
of ``non-whites''?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The  member  was  talking  within  the
context of the past. That is how I took it. Carry on, Mr Raju.

Mr N M RAJU: Thank you,  Chair,  I  appreciate  that.  People  must  listen.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: What is out of order, hon member?

Mr S L E FENYANYE: Chairperson, as you  have  allowed  the  member  to  make
reference to non-whites as a term that was used in the past, will you  allow
me to use non-blacks in the context of something  that  took  place  in  the
past?
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Your question is irrelevant for  now.  It  is
not a point of order. Mr Raju continue, please.

Mr N M RAJU: Thank you, Chair. Those were the volatile  years  of  political
strife, with the draconian laws of apartheid and of  racial  discrimination;
group areas; separate but unequal facilities  -  almost  always  inadequate;
and when men, women and children who happened to  be  of  the  wrong  colour
were accosted and assaulted on all sides, without the slightest  provocation
or on the flimsiest grounds, with such jackboot  ferocity  of  which  German
fascist storm troopers would have been proud.

It was the year of the Rivonia trials. It  was  the  year  when  the  former
President of the ANC, Chief Albert Luthuli, was house-arrested and  confined
to his home in Groutville, in the Lower Tugela  district.  Fortunately,  for
young activists like me, Chief Luthuli's house arrest meant  that  we  could
meet him, clandestinely of course, in Stanger where I lived and taught.

We had an underground cell, the Natal Indian Congress cell 29,  of  which  I
was the secretary. During one of our many discussions,  the  subject  turned
to teachers and politics. And Chief Luthuli said to me and I quote:


  Nelly boy ...


  - that was what I was known as -


  ... if you tell your class that 87% of South  Africa's  land  is  in  the
  hands of 13% of its population, that is the whites, you are  not  talking
  politics, you are teaching arithmetic.

That was my initial induction to statistics. That, of course,  gave  me  the
inspiration to intensify my activities in political conscientising.

Figures can be very interesting and illuminating. Statistics SA  is  in  the
business of providing, and I quote:


   ... timely,  accurate  and  accessible  official  statistics  to  inform
  economic growth, development and democracy in South Africa.

Good government is only good when it can identify  and  address  policy  and
delivery  challenges.  Statistics  SA  has  the  onerous  responsibility  of
ensuring that it provides accurate information  to  the  various  Government
departments who, in  turn,  can  base  their  delivery  mechanisms  on  that
information to ensure optimum benefit to the  intended  beneficiaries,  that
is, the public. For example, on a recent trip to Mpumalanga, as a member  of
the Select Committee on Finance  which  is  under  the  able  leadership  of
Dorothy Mahlangu, we were informed of the  confusion  and  problems  created
for  the  department  of  social  welfare  by  the  influx  of  people  from
neighbouring  provinces  and  countries.  We  were  informed  that  it   was
virtually impossible for accurate data or statistics  to  be  kept  so  that
pensions and maintenance grants for children could  be  accurately  assessed
and paid out. Claimants, of course, far exceeded figures catered for.

Statistics become paramount in importance if the  citizens  of  our  country
are to be properly taken care of. Statistics SA does not  make  policy,  the
Government does. But the policies that the  Government  makes  can  only  be
good  if  they  are  based  on  sound,  scientifically  produced  data   and
statistics.
There is no doubt that Statistics SA is a  very  busy  organisation  because
our new democracy is  busy  transforming  society  in  multifarious  aspects
which  are  constantly  changing.  The  various  Ministries  and  Government
departments are sustained by an insatiable hunger and thirst for  up-to-date
information,  data  and  statistics.  Should  these  not  be   provided   by
Statistics SA satisfactorily, then Government departments would suffer  from
the pangs of information kwashiorkor,  that  is,  information  malnutrition.
Nobody  ...  [Interjections.]  needs  some  education  and   semantics   ...
[Interjections] ... at my own time. [Laughter.] [Applause.] [Time expired.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, before I  call  the  next
speaker, I would like to remind you that the rules of the House are that  we
address each other as ``hon''. You did not say ``hon'' Dorothy Mahlangu.

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I apologise for that.

Mr J F AULSEBROOK (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  Minister  and
colleagues in the House,  we  in  the  province  of  KwaZulu-Natal  wish  to
compliment Statistics SA for the sterling work and dedication  in  compiling
and  maintaining  a  comprehensive  statistical  database,  which  serves  a
variety  of  end  users,  in  both  the  public  and  private  sectors,  and
contributes, in great measure, to improving,  planning  and  decision-making
in the country as a whole.

The need for reliable and accurate official  statistical  information  in  a
progressive  country  cannot  be   overemphasised.   Economic   and   social
advancement hinges on this class of information.

There are, however, two  specific  concerns,  which  I,  on  behalf  of  our
province, wish to address today. Firstly, because of  the  census  which  is
held only every five years, much of the data and many of  the  socioeconomic
indicators become dated towards the end  of  the  five-year  interval  after
publication of the statistics.

With  the  exception  of  certain  demographic  and  population  statistics,
Statistics SA does not have a mechanism in place to annually  update  or  to
provide estimates on a variety of  socioeconomic  indicators,  such  as  the
access to services, literacy rates, employment figures, etc.  This  has  the
effect of limiting the end users, in the case of our provincial  government,
to very outdated statistics for the purpose of policy formulation,  planning
and resource allocation. For example, many of the  socioeconomic  indicators
which are currently in use date back to  the  1996  census  and  these  will
chronically be out of date by  the  time  the  next  census  results  become
available in 2003.
Secondly, from the point of view of  the  provincial  government,  it  is  a
matter of great regret that Statistics SA no longer collects  statistics  on
gross geographical product. Our information is that  Statistics  SA  stopped
collecting gross geographical product  data  in  1994  and  cited  budgetary
constraints as the reasons for this  unfortunate  decision.  This  makes  it
very difficult,  if  not  impossible,  to  accurately  measure  and  monitor
critical indicators such as regional growth rates,  the  overall  levels  of
economic activity in each province and  the  like.  This  is  all  the  more
serious because both the National  Treasury  and  the  FFC  models  used  to
determine the equitable share allocation to provinces rely on  estimates  of
economic activity in each province.

In the absence of official GGP statistics,  these  estimates  rely  on  very
unreliable data such as regional services  councils,  or  as  they  are  now
known,  district  councils,  regarding   levies,   turnover   and   employee
remunerations to establish the relative size of provincial economies.

The provincial treasury, and the  provincial  government  as  a  whole,  are
experiencing great difficulty in  conducting  a  macroeconomic  analysis  of
issues such  as  the  impact  of  provincial  government  spending  and  the
regional economy in the absence of reliable GGP statistics. This,  in  turn,
impacts on the quality of forward-planning strategic decision-making.

In the light of the above considerations, we would  urge  Statistics  SA  to
investigate  the  feasibility  of  collecting  official  gross  geographical
product statistics once again, to assist provinces  with  the  all-important
task of prioritising and  allocating  scarce  resources  within  an  overall
macroeconomic plan.

In conclusion, we in KwaZulu-Natal province, in supporting this Vote,  would
go further and support an even larger allocation of funds, if it  meant  the
more efficient provision of timeously supplied appropriate statistical  data
that includes GGP statistics which have been made easier for all to  access.
Finally, we in KwaZulu-Natal are currently preparing for and will be  giving
full support to Census 2001. [Applause.]

Mr N M ISAACS (Western Cape): Chairperson, the launch of Census 2001 in  the
Western Cape on 14 June was the second democratic census in the  history  of
South Africa. Everybody is aware of the fact that  the  actual  census  will
take place from 10 October  to  31  October  2001.  Census  night  is  on  9
October, the night when it must be noted how many people spend  the  evening
in every house, and not to forget the many who do not have roofs over  their
heads and are sleeping  on  the  sidewalks,  as  well  as  our  dear  street
children.

Die Wes-Kaapse Premier het by die bekendstelling gevra hoekom dit  nodig  is
om 'n akkurate sensusopname te  hÃª.  Die  standaardantwoord  is:  Sodat  ons
behoorlik kan beplan. As ons weet hoeveel kinders daar  is,  hoe  oud  hulle
is, sal ons weet hoeveel skole nodig is. Ons sal ook  weet  waar  dit  gebou
moet word. As ons weet hoeveel mense  voertuie  besit,  sal  ons  behoorlike
padprogramme  kan   saamstel.   Dieselfde   geld   vir   hospitale,   parke,
sportgronde, biblioteke en behuising. Dit is ook belangrik om  te  weet  wat
die gemiddelde ouderdomsvlak van die inwoners  is;  hoeveel  bejaardes  daar
is, sodat daar ook vir hulle beplan kan word.

In die 1996-sensus was daar meer vroue as mans  en  hierdie  punt  is  reeds
vroeÃ«r vermeld: 51% vroue teenoor 49% mans. Sewe-en dertig persent  van  ons
bevolking was tussen 16 en 35 jaar  oud,  terwyl  5,2%  van  die  Wes-Kaapse
bevolking ouer as 65 jaar was. Daar is ook met skok besef dat  13%  van  ons
bevolking ouer as 15 jaar is en glad nie kon lees of skryf nie.

Ook is vasgestel dat 60% van die Kaapprovinsie se inwoners  Afrikaans  praat
en slegs 20% Engels praat. Dit wys net  hoe  belangrik  statistiek  is.  Nog
verdere inligting wat  verskil  van  die  sensus  is  dat  76%  van  al  die
huishoudings elektrisiteit het, terwyl 85% toilette  en  75%  waterkrane  in
hul huise het; wat alles ver  bo  die  landsgemiddeld  is.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The Premier of the Western Cape  asked  at  the  introduction  why  it  was
necessary to undertake an accurate census. The standard reply  is:  So  that
proper planning can take place. If we know how many children there are,  and
their age, we will know how many schools are required.  We  will  also  know
where they should be built. If we know how many people possess vehicles,  we
will be able to draft  proper  programmes  for  roads.  The  same  goes  for
hospitals,  parks,  sports  grounds,  libraries  and  housing.  It  is  also
important to know the average age of citizens; how many elderly  there  are,
so that planning for them can take place.

In the 1996 census there were  more  women  than  men  and  this  point  has
already been mentioned earlier: 51% women as opposed  to  49%  men.  Thirty-
seven percent of our population was between 16 and 35 years old, while  5,2%
of the population of the Western Cape  was  older  than  65  years.  It  was
realised with alarm that 13% of our population was older than 15  and  could
not read or write.

It was also established that 60% of the  inhabitants  of  the  Western  Cape
spoke Afrikaans, and  only  20%  English.  This  just  shows  how  important
statistics are. Further information that differs from  the  census  is  that
76% of all households have electricity, while 85% have toilets and 75%  have
taps in their houses, which is well above average in the country.]

A further very important point is the skewed figures that were derived  from
the last census. According to the last Census  SA  Statistical  Services  in
the Western Cape, the population was established at 3,9 million -  some  161
000 people fewer than  counted in the  previous  census.  The  Western  Cape
government was convinced  that  this  was  not  a  true  reflection  of  our
population. The question we still wrestle with is: How was is possible  that
each and every province in South  Africa  recorded  a  population  increase,
whilst the Western Cape recorded a population decrease?

Mrs A M VERSFELD: SÃª hulle! SÃª hulle!  [Tussenwerpsels.]  [Tell  them!  Tell
them! [Interjections.]]

Mr N M ISAACS: I am speaking  purely  from  the  point  of  view  of  census
figures, and if anybody wants to dispute it, they should  have  their  fight
with the census people.

We had our own count done by a well-known demographer, Prof Sadie  from  the
University of Stellenbosch. His count was way above 4 million, and this  was
even borne out further by Absa, who put it at 4,23 million.  The  difference
has led to the fact that, based on with the FFC formula,  the  Western  Cape
received less.
Mrs A M VERSFELD: SÃª hulle! SÃª hulle! [Tell them! Tell them!]

Mr N M ISAACS: If we are right and this stands out like a  sore  thumb,  and
if all the other provinces have shown a gain and  we  in  the  Western  Cape
show a decrease, then there  must  be  something  rotten  in  the  state  of
Denmark. The best thing to do in our view was to have  our  figures  tested.
[Interjections.] It is the hon member's prerogative  to  disagree  with  me.
That I will not even challenge.

Almal is bewus daarvan dat die Wes-Kaap gesien word  as  die  provinsie  met
die beste gesondheidsdiens, behuising, sosiale  dienste  -  nou  luister  sy
nie, Voorsitter - werksgeleenthede, dit is 'n ellelange lys. Ons skole  bars
uit  hul  nate  van   kinders   wat   hier   hul   onderwys   wil   ontvang.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Dis 'n feit soos 'n koei. Ons weet van kinders  wat  gekom
het met rapporte ...

Mev J WITBOOI: Hulle kom van ander provinsies af.

Mnr N M ISAACS: Gee my tog die kans om te vertel  van  soveel  kinders.  Ons
laaste telling toe die skole op Vrydag sluit, verskil van toe die skool  die
volgende jaar open. Toe is daardie skool te klein, soos hulle aangekom  het.
Wat sÃª dit? Die beste is maar altyd hier in die Wes-Kaap.  [Tussenwerpsels.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We are all aware that the Western Cape is regarded as  being  the  province
with the best health service, housing, social services  -  now  she  is  not
listening, Chair - job opportunities, the list is endless. Our  schools  are
bursting  at  the  seams  with  children  who  want  to  be  educated  here.
[Interjections.] This is an absolute fact. We  know  of  children  who  came
with reports ...

Mrs J WITBOOI: They are from other provinces.

Mr N M ISAACS:  Just give  me  a  chance  to  tell  the  House  of  so  many
children. Our last count, when the schools break up on Friday, differs  from
the day the schools reopen the following  year.  Then  that  school  is  too
small, as the children have arrived. What does this tell  us?  The  best  is
always to be found here in the Western Cape. [Interjections.]]

The high rate of urbanisation among Africans is explained by the  fact  that
the Cape metropolitan  area  offers  some  of  the  best  opportunities  for
employment   in   a   time   of   deteriorating   economic    circumstances.
[Interjections.]

If members would just take a count, I can promise  them  that  people  think
that milk and honey is flowing down  our  streets.  [Interjections.]  It  is
remarkable that everybody feels that they want to be in  the  Western  Cape.
[Interjections.]

Consequently, many people in the TBVC states, generally and from the  former
Transkei, particularly, migrated to the Western Cape. It  is  a  fact.  They
migrated from Umtata and all over the Eastern  Cape.  They  think  that  the
Western Cape is the star to every wandering barque. That is the way to  find
a home. [Interjections.]

I could even go into the sex ratio, but  I  am  not  going  to.  I  want  to
emphasize that the unemployment rate is lower in the Western  Cape  than  in
the rest of the country. [Interjections.] In South Africa as a whole ...

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: In town, yes. But what about Khayelitsha?
Mr N M ISAACS: In South Africa as a whole, 17% of the  population  is  found
to be unemployed when using the strict definition,  and  29%  is  unemployed
using the  expanded  one.  This  may  indicate  that  there  are  more  work
opportunities  in  the  Western  Cape  than  elsewhere   in   the   country.
[Interjections.] It may also indicate that the transport to a place of  job-
seeking  is   more   accessible   and   cheaper   in   the   Western   Cape.
[Interjections.] [Time expired.]

Mr A MARAIS: Chairperson, perhaps the hon member  has  not  been  to  Uitsig
where sewerage in the streets forms part of  the  landscape  of  the  place.
Perhaps he needs to visit that place. [Interjections.]

Deputy Minister and colleagues, in 1990  Farouk  and  McKellar  pointed  out
that in development planning special attention should be paid  to  the  ways
in which demographic factors affect not only  the  quantity,  but  also  the
quality of the human resources base. Thus, their claim, and I quote:


  The  implications  of  demographic  changes  must  be   integrated   into
  developmental planning if social and economic objectives are to  achieved
  at all levels of  planning,  that  is,  overall  macroplanning,  sectoral
  planning, regional and local planning.

Moving from this perspective, I submit that  the  Free  State  was  recently
declared the second poorest province in the country. To derive the most  out
of our strategic planning  efforts,  demographic  studies  of  the  targeted
communities and areas become an absolute necessity. We  are  convinced  that
if this reality had been detected immediately after  the  last  census,  our
proactive response would have been more timely and beneficial to the  people
of our province. It may even  have  impacted  positively  on  the  equitable
share of our province.

We have large concentrations of poor people  in  QwaQwa,  Botshabelo,  Thaba
Nchu, the south western Free State,  the  Gold  Fields,  etc.  This  reality
makes rapid urbanisation an indispensable matter. This, in  turn,  places  a
disproportionate responsibility on local government and the people  who  can
afford to pay a little extra for services.

Living data is what is required. Not only past and current information,  but
also reliable information about the future, will  influence  the  manner  in
which we proactively plan for the provision of  services.  In  other  words,
environmental changes determine  the  relevance  of  the  current  available
information.

Internal  migratory  patterns  impact  on  the  economic  situation  of  our
province and other provinces. I would like to make  an  example.  The  other
day - I cannot remember at which meeting we were -  I  made  an  observation
that if one comes to Cape Town in the morning, one sees  a  steady  increase
in the number of foreign cars  around  here.  Such  possible  emigration  of
economically active and  professional  persons  from  our  province  to  the
Western Cape, especially, and,  perhaps,  Kwazulu-Natal  and  Gauteng,  will
eventually impact on the competitiveness of our province and  likewise,  the
capabilities of other provinces.

Demographically, it means that the  city's  population  increases.   On  the
other  hand,  as  the  city's  population  decreases,  the  utilisation   of
infrastructure is affected  downwards  and  it  becomes  more  expensive  to
maintain.

There has been much debate about the fiscal autonomy of provinces in  recent
times. The FFC recommends that due consideration be given  to  a  provincial
tax, something that may be devised from a pay-as-you-earn basis.  This  begs
the question: Now  that  people  are  relocating  to  other  provinces,  how
feasible would such a tax be for our province? Would it extend  the  current
disparity? Again, I want to propagate the necessity of living data.

According to Bryson and Roering, and I quote:


  Strategic  planning  focuses  on  achieving  the  best  fit  between   an
  organisation and its environment.

Emanating from this perspective  is  the  fact  that  a  common  orientation
throughout  the  Government  creates  favourable  conditions  for   improved
performance. The strategic plan directs all  stakeholders  to  consider  the
implications  of  any  decision  on  the  basis  of  the  interface  of  the
Government with its entire environment. Also, the strategic  logic  of  each
decision can be treated by reference to the strategic plan. For example,  to
address the needs of the elderly in foster homes,  decision-makers  must  be
knowledgeable about the environment of elderly  living  with  their  natural
families.

Constant references are made to abject or relative poverty, and very  little
is said about latent poverty, poverty that lies in wait. It is not  uncommon
to find that many a family is reliant on the income of the elderly.  In  the
event such breadwinners pass on  the  already  overencumbered  families  are
further burdened.

What  we  need  in  the  Free  State  is  information  not  only  about  the
concentrations of poor people,  but  also  about  the  effects  of  poverty.
Understanding  demographics  becomes  a  condition  for  effectiveness   and
efficiency, efficiency being a precursor to effectiveness.

In conclusion, the reasoning that demonstrates the correctness  of  the  use
of demographic analysis in  strategic  planning  for  the  Government  seems
applicable in  the  private  sector  as  well,  because  a  profile  of  the
population is  equally  important  in  determining  results.  Somebody  once
wrote, and I quote:


  A  vision  for  change  is  a  comprehensive  strategic   map   for   the
  revitalisation of distressed communities ...

Stemming from this, we would like to find  out  whether  affirmative  action
employment policies  are  compatible  with  the  principles  of  substantive
equality as directed by the Constitution.

I am sure by now hon members have noticed that I basically  propagate  three
things on behalf of the province; firstly, permanent reliable  and  accurate
data, in other words, living data,  secondly,  permanent  and  comprehensive
research with regard to the effects of poverty and, implicit  in  all  this,
community ownership of the census  process.  The  Free  State  supports  the
Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  thank  hon
members for what I think has  been  a  lively  debate.  And  I  would  like,
perhaps before responding to some of the issues that  have  been  raised  in
the debate, to capture some of the issues that we had wanted  to  convey  to
the House, but, for reasons of time, we chose to leave to the end.

In the context of the macroeconomic policy of Government, the drive for  job
creation and the delivery of social services, we have identified four  broad
strategies.  Statistics  SA  has  the  responsibility  to   provide   common
statistical  denominators  at  both  geographic  and  thematic  levels  that
operationalise, monitor and measure the outcomes and impact of the  policies
and strategies that Government prioritises.

We would like to outline some of  these  priorities  and  postulate  how  we
intend relating to them as Statistics SA. One of  these  is  the  Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Strategy. The vision for rural development  is
to eliminate poverty and enable development by focusing on the provision  of
infrastructure and services in rural areas, and  restoring  economic  rights
to marginalised areas. Poverty  and  agricultural  activity  statistics  are
critical in ensuring policy formulation, implementation and monitoring.

Geographically   referenced   small-area    statistics    enable    targeted
interventions. The current challenge to both the national statistics  system
and Government is how well  the  national  denominators  are  collated,  how
progress is monitored and how performance is measured. Intended incomes  and
impact are measured and understood.

Statistics SA, in conjunction with the Department of  Provincial  and  Local
Government and IDT, are conducting a bench-mark study in the 13 nodal  areas
that have been identified as pilots for the rural development strategy,  and
will be rolling out more studies to inform policy on the  state  of  affairs
and what needs attention in those areas.

The second area is that of urban renewal.  We  saw  the  hon  the  President
launching an urban renewal programme  in  Alexandra  about  two  weeks  ago.
Crime and poverty are to be tackled together in  high-density  urban  areas.
Continued unemployment and poverty provide a fertile environment for  crime,
which  is  to  be  tackled  by  an  integrated  justice  strategy.  Economic
statistics,  especially  on  labour  market  dynamics  at  lower  levels  of
geography, coupled with small-area statistics on service  delivery,  provide
critical  information  for  local,  provincial   and   national   government
programmes. The challenge to the statistics system is even more  complex  in
this area, as the demand  for  small-area  statistics  becomes  increasingly
pressing and the direction of  resource  flows  and  benefits  needs  to  be
tracked.

The third area is that of public-sector  transformation.  Effective  service
delivery in the spirit of Batho Pele is the primary goal of  Public  Service
transformation. Developing the statistics system and enhancing  the  quality
of statistics not only provides delivery  of  better  statistical  services,
but also allows Government departments to plan and monitor  the  inputs  and
outputs of their own service delivery.  In  addition,  an  emphasis  on  the
development of Statistics SA's human  resource  capacity  provides  for  the
sustainability of quality initiatives.

Let me turn to some of the policy issues that  confront  us,  based  on  the
October household surveys. Statistics SA  has  just  completed  a  five-year
comparative analysis of data, measuring the extent of development  in  South
Africa. In the area of housing, the data suggests  that  although  there  is
improvement in the type of housing people live in, there is  a  simultaneous
increase in the number of informal or shack  dwellings.  For  instance,  the
proportion of formal housing increased from 65% of all housing in  1995,  to
69% in 1999. At the same time, the number of shacks increased from  7,5%  to
12,3%. This constitutes a  major  challenge  that  the  cluster  looking  at
housing and associated services will have to tackle.
The proportion of  the  population  in  urban  areas  exhibits  two  related
patterns, which are predominant only amongst  the  black  population  group.
One pattern is the level of urbanisation and the other is the trend  towards
urbanisation. Regarding the level of urbanisation -  the  proportion  is  at
its peak in the 25 to 49 age range. The trend suggests that within this  age
group a disproportionately large number of people  migrate  to  urban  areas
and move back to rural areas when they reach the age of 50. This pattern  of
movement has a higher peak for men compared to women, constituting  59%  and
54%  respectively.  This  suggests  that  the  policy  of  apartheid   still
continues to have  far-reaching  implications  on  our  society.  A  related
policy question pertains to how this massive migration might affect  capital
formation,  for  example,  in  policies  geared  towards   addressing   home
ownership.

Let me now deal with some of  the  issues  that  have  been  raised  by  hon
members. I think that it would be fair and accurate to say  with  regard  to
the hon Dr Conroy's statement that there may be a maxim that  says:  ``Lies,
damn lies and statistics'', but we think that  we  are  moving  towards  one
that says: ``Truth, the  whole  truth  and  statistics''.  [Laughter.]  This
really captures what the essence of the  change  in  Statistics  SA  is  all
about. Over the last five or six years we have seen  substantial  change  in
that particular regard.

Further, I think the hon Makgatho should go and tell  his  premier  that  he
may not have been counted personally, because they did not find  him,  since
he was very busy. [Laughter.] However, they certainly went to his  home  and
were told that he existed. [Laughter.] I think  the  point  about  the  1996
census results, with all of its imperfections - and we accept that it  could
not have been a perfect product - is that  it  is  still  the  best  set  of
information that we have in South Africa. I think the last  real  census  in
South Africa was conducted in 1970. Is that correct? After that the  country
fragmented into homelands and self-governing territories. So the  last  real
all inclusive census was conducted in 1970. Thus, the 1996 census, with  all
its imperfections, still gives us the  best  set  of  information  to  date.
Clearly, Census 2001 will take us further along the route of  deepening  and
broadening the statistical base that we use in order to make choices and  to
make decisions.

Regarding the issue of the time gap between  the  collection  of  statistics
and the publication thereof, yes, hon members are quite right. It is  a  big
gap. In terms of the census that we are  approaching  now,  it  is  actually
expected that it is going to take us two years before  we  can  publish  the
results. Perhaps it would  help  if  hon  members  understood  what  happens
during that period. There are various stages involved, and the  first  stage
is one where one has to process all of the data  that  has  been  collected.
That  is  a  process  that  is  done  through  the  scanning  of   all   the
questionnaires, which I spoke about during  my  earlier  intervention.  This
alone will take about eight months.

The second stage is one during which  one  compares  the  census  data  with
something called the postenumeration survey, which  is  used  to  check  the
very census that has just been conducted. In a sense, it checks the  quality
of the data that has come out of the census  itself,  and  that  also  takes
about eight months.

The third stage  is  an  adjustment  stage  during  which  one  adjusts  the
results, comparing them with other data from other sources  that  one  would
have collected, and that takes about four months. So  hon  members  can  see
that the census is quite an involved process.  Of  course,  the  fourth  and
final stage is that  of  writing  the  final  report  and  its  publication.
However, the important thing is that in  between  censuses,  important  work
which  helps  to  capture  changes  that  take  place  in  demographics  and
economics gets done.

The surveys that are  conducted  in  between  population  censuses  give  us
information on those changes, and through  them  one  can  measure  a  whole
range  of  issues.  For  example,  changes  in  education   and   employment
population demographics and infrastructure and facilities that  people  have
access to over time. So, that is the  instrument  that  we  use  in  between
censuses in order to make sure that while the information dates in terms  of
the result of the census, it does not completely date because  one  is  able
to conduct these kinds of surveys.

Regarding the issue of gross geographic information which that  hon  members
spoke about, that  is  a  matter  that  is  currently  receiving  attention.
Recently, a workshop was held that involved  a  range  of  stakeholders  who
actually began to look at how one can plan and map the way forward for  this
kind of information. I see that Mr Isaacs really  loves  the  Western  Cape.
[Laughter.] [Interjections.] Would he love it if it were under ANC  control?
[Laughter.] Would he continue to  love  it  the  way  he  does?  [Laughter.]
[Interjections.]

Let me turn to the issue of the 1996 census results for the Western Cape.  I
know that the Western Cape was very unhappy about  them,  because  they  had
budgetary implications. However, there are a few things  that  can  be  said
about this. That hon member mentioned getting  their  own  demographers  and
statisticians to do the work for them. But Statistics SA has  met  with  the
hon member's demographer, Prof Sadie, for example, who  attended  a  meeting
which was attended by representatives  from  Statistics  SA,  in  which  the
Western Cape situation was reflected upon.

From our understanding, on the basis of those discussions,  Prof  Sadie  was
in agreement with the people from Statistics SA on the work  that  was  done
in the Western Cape and the results that came out of that census.  Regarding
the budgetary process, the Western Cape is not the  only  province  that  is
undergoing budgetary adjustments on the basis of the information  that  came
out of the 1996 census. But what we did was to say that in  order  to  avoid
disruption in those provinces in which the population outcome was less  than
had been believed before we will face the impact of  those  results  over  a
five-year period. But we did that also to ensure  that  in  those  provinces
that would be receiving more  resources,  because  they  have  more  people,
their absorptive capacity has to be  built.  We  cannot  simply  throw  more
money at them. Instead, that process has to be phased in  over  a  five-year
period.

The other important issue is that the budget, as we  apply  it,  is  also  a
redistributive instrument, because, as hon members know, our  provinces  are
not at the same level of development. Indeed, we do  direct  resources  from
the better-off provinces to the poorer ones, because  we  are  building  one
country here.

Instability in terms of population  migration  patterns  will  always  be  a
permanent feature if hon members cannot ensure that their provinces reach  a
fair level of development across the board. If  that  happens,  hon  members
will have stability in terms of the movement of  people  from  one  area  to
another. But the other piece of information is that the  population  of  the
Western Cape between 1991 and 1996 grew from  3,4  to  3,9  million.  So,  I
would like to tell Mr Isaacs that all is not gloom. One of the  things  that
have puzzled commentators, observers and people  who  have  read  Statistics
SA's poverty report which  was  done  last  year  is  that  the  Free  State
featured quite prominently as a poor province.

We had previously believed that  the  poorest  provinces  were  the  Eastern
Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and the Northern Province. But the Free  State  featured
quite prominently in  the  poverty  report.  I  think  that  without  taking
anything away from this fact, which is a reality that is on  the  ground  in
the Free State, what we must understand is that this poverty is in terms  of
expenditure. The measure of poverty cannot be limited only in terms  of  the
expenditure, because there are other factors that  have  to  be  taken  into
account. For example, issues of social development,  infrastructure  and  so
on have to be looked into.

I think that what this could reflect is that some of the people that may  be
working on the farms in the Free State, are not paid in cash. They are  paid
in kind by being given portions of food, therefore they do  not  necessarily
go and buy some of the things that they consume. But I think  that  that  is
an angle that we must understand, that  this  is  a  poverty  measure  which
reflects it in terms of the capacity to spend, and it has to  be  understood
that  there  is  that  possible  angle  that  some  of  the  people  may  be
remunerated in ways other than cash.

I think that these are just some of the issues that we wanted  to  highlight
and, I think, perhaps to round off this debate, one would want to  say  that
we are pleased that Statistics SA is an organisation that  has  demonstrated
beyond doubt that it is resilient and that it can adapt to  change.  In  the
past  five  years  it  has  revitalised  the  statistics  system  and  given
sufficient prominence to social and demographic  statistics  and  created  a
census database that emulates that of countries that are ahead of us.

It has re-engineered  economic  statistics  and  continues  to  address  the
limitations  that  exist  across  series,  especially  those   relating   to
employment. In terms of regional obligations, we have  taken  the  lead  and
SADC has assigned South Africa the task of being the  focal  point  for  the
SADC 2000-01 round of censuses that is taking  place.  The  organisation  is
well poised to execute Census 2001  and  has  led  the  way  in  encouraging
participation at all levels of society.

The voice of the NCOP is called upon to support Census 2001  and  Statistics
SA. Although challenges are extensive, the vision  is  clear  and  direction
has been defined, and there is substantial movement in that direction.

I would like to thank all  the  members  who  participated  in  the  debate.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.
The Council adjourned at 16:20.

3.    Report of the Select Committee on Land and  Environmental  Affairs  on
     Visits to Provinces, dated 4 April 2001:


     The Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs, having  visited
     the Northern Cape, Free State, Eastern  Cape,  KwaZulu-Natal,  Northern
     Province and Mpumalanga, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         The Committee undertook the visits to deal with matters  pertaining
         to land claims and restitution.  The  objective  was  to  find  out
         first-hand what people involved in the process of land  claims  and
         restitution feel about the process. This  will  in  turn  help  the
         Committee  to  recommend  what  should  be  done  to   remedy   the
         situation. The decision to undertake the visits came  as  a  result
         of numerous calls  from  different  communities  affected  by  land
         claims and restitution. The communities  wanted  the  Committee  to
         see for themselves what progress has been made so far.


     B.     Northern Cape
         1. Delegation


              The delegation consisted of Mrs R A Ndzanga, Mr J Horne and Mr
              T Thisani (Committee Secretary).


         2. Meeting with MEC


              Before the delegation visited communities, they had a  meeting
              with the MEC, Mr T Makweye. He outlined the progress  made  so
              far with land claims and restitution, and frustrations  shared
              by communities affected by the process. He pointed out that  a
              parliamentary committee visited the province about  two  years
              ago on the same issue,  but  nothing  came  from  it  and  the
              promises made were never fulfilled.


              The MEC mentioned that of six major  claims  lodged  with  the
              Land Claims Commission,  three  were  still  outstanding.  The
              major stumbling block was the lack of human resource  capacity
              in the land claims office in Kimberley.  The  office  did  not
              have a researcher for quite some time, until one was appointed
              recently. The MEC emphasised the need for the  new  provincial
              land commissioner to visit the province on a regular basis, as
              he has not done so since assuming office. The MEC  hoped  that
              the proposal from the national Department of  Agriculture  and
              Land Affairs  that  the  system  changes  from  one  of  legal
              obligations to an administrative perspective  would  speed  up
              the process. The systems that will help to reroute the process
              to that direction need be put in place.


         3. Visit to Majeng
              (1) Historical background


                  Majeng is a settlement of about  35  000  ha,  with  2Â 000
                  households. The Commission's Advisory Commission  on  Land
                  Allocation (ACLA) inherited the Majeng claim in  1995.  It
                  was one of the presidential leading projects earmarked  to
                  be settled before other cases like  Kono,  Groenwater  and
                  Skeifontein.   Unfortunately   the   leadership   of   the
                  community was divided, thus delaying settlement.


              (2) Process


                  Before the claim was resolved, one part of the  leadership
                  decided to invade the land. This necessitated a  mediation
                  process, led by Mr Mac Robert, to bring the current  land-
                  owners  and  the  community  to  a  common  understanding.
                  However,   that   initiative   collapsed.   The   regional
                  commission tried several times to  persuade  the  invaders
                  to vacate the land, to no avail.  A  second  mediator,  Mr
                  David Story, was solicited, but he could not persuade  the
                  invaders to leave the land either.


                  Ultimately, in 1997, the matter was referred to  the  Land
                  Claims Court. The first pretrial conference  was  held  on
                  17  May  1999,  and  the  court  directed  mediation   for
                  intracommunal disputes. Mr Chris Spies  was  appointed  as
                  mediator, and as a result of his effort a joint  committee
                  was formed. This joint committee held  its  first  meeting
                  on  9  October  1999.  Its   responsibilities   were   the
                  following:


                  (a)  To  assist  the  Department  and  the  Commission  in
                       drawing up a list of claimants on the land.


                  (b)  To determine the role of traditional authority.


                  (c)  To review the work done by Neloma consultancies.
                  (d)  To assist in establishing a legal entity.


              (3) Findings


                  The Majeng community was frustrated  by  the  delay.  They
                  felt it was as a result of many departments  handling  the
                  same claim. The community itself was  divided  on  how  to
                  solve the problem. The court  was  handling  their  claim,
                  but insisted that the community had to unite in  order  to
                  put forward their case as one.  To  resolve  the  lack  of
                  unity, the MEC and the community promised  to  meet  every
                  month, and that it would be a matter of  time  before  the
                  unity was resolved.


                  An  NGO,   Ancra,   was   helping   the   community   with
                  facilitation of the claim. As a result  of  their  advice,
                  the community  joined  forces  and  was  hoping  that  the
                  process would move forward. The Commission  was  going  to
                  appoint a facilitator to help verify the claimants.


                  There was also the issue of chieftainship that  needed  to
                  be resolved. The community needed to resolve which one  of
                  the two  chiefs  was  their  true  leader.  The  community
                  refused to accept both as leaders; to them only one  chief
                  was acceptable. Once this issue was resolved, the role  of
                  the chief in the land  claim  process  would  have  to  be
                  resolved.   Whilst   their   claim   was    still    under
                  consideration, the community cried out  for  provision  of
                  basic needs, such as running water, a  clinic,  transport,
                  a school and sanitation.


         4. Visit to Lohatlha Battle School


              (1) Historical background


                  The area  was  about  49  000  ha  in  size,  with  12Â 000
                  households. Until the  1970s  the  Gatlhose  and  Maremane
                  communities lived in  the  native  reserves  northwest  of
                  Kuruman, some 40 km south of Kathu  and  30  km  north  of
                  Postmasburg. The reserves were 49 000 ha and  12  000  ha,
                  respectively, and afforded  the  communities  an  adequate
                  pastoral existence. The communities lived in  24  villages
                  scattered across the reserves. The area  was  mountainous,
                  with many wells and boreholes. It  had  good  agricultural
                  potential and mining resources, on which  the  communities
                  lived and survived.


                  During 1976 and 1977, communities were forcefully  removed
                  to Lexey, Pepsi, Slough, Deurham and  Bendel,  30km  north
                  of Kuruman, on  the  edge  of  the  Kalahari  Desert.  The
                  Gatlhose and Maremane native  reserves  were  incorporated
                  into the SA Army Battle  School  in  Lohatlha.  The  other
                  areas mentioned above, where the  other  communities  were
                  relocated  to,  were  dry  and  sandy  areas  with  little
                  agricultural potential and  far  from  mines  (where  many
                  comunity members  were  employed),  towns  and  hospitals.
                  There was no infrastructure, water or work.


              (2) Process


                  The community  lodged  a  claim  for  restoration  of  the
                  native reserves with ACLA in 1991. The  claim  was  deemed
                  to have been lodged with the Commission in  terms  of  the
                  Restitution of  Land  Rights  Act,  1994.  The  Department
                  conducted various investigations into this claim,  and  in
                  1995 it was accepted as a legitimate and valid claim.  The
                  communities have since been engaged in  negotiations  with
                  the SANDF, the Department and the Commission in an  effort
                  to resolve the claim. The matter was  eventually  referred
                  to the Land Claims Court, in April 1997.  The  court  held
                  two pretrial conferences, on 16 September 1997 and  on  22
                  January  1998,  and  it   directed   the   Department   to
                  investigate and identify whether  alternative  State-owned
                  land within the boundaries of the SA  Army  Battle  School
                  at  Lohatlha   could   feasibly   be   restored   to   the
                  communities,  taking   into   account   the   agricultural
                  potential of the land and the issue  of  contamination  of
                  land    by    unexploded    ammunition    debris.    These
                  investigations were conducted by  the  Department,  Mechem
                  consultants  and  a  community  investigation  task  team,
                  which reported their results to the court.


                  The  community  formed  a  Communal  Property  Association
                  (CPA) to hold and manage any land which may in  future  be
                  allocated to them. They  tasked  the  Department  and  its
                  regional counterparts in May and  June  1999  to  identify
                  neighbouring farms, in  consultation  with  claimants,  as
                  alternative land. Since then the communities have not  had
                  any  formal  response  from  the  Department.   The   next
                  pretrial  conference  in  the  Land   Claims   Court   was
                  scheduled for 28 October 1999. The claim  was  the  entire
                  Lohatlha battlefield and  not  only  the  areas  with  low
                  contamination levels, as reflected in the Mechem report.


              (3) Findings


                  The community residing within the Battle  School  (Khosis)
                  raised the following concerns:
                  (a)  They are forced to sign in  and  out  of  the  School
                       when they come in and go out.


                  (b)  Permission should be sought  from  the  SANDF  for  a
                       member of a family to visit relatives who  reside  in
                       the School. The community  felt  that  this  hindered
                       their  freedom  of  movement,  as  enshrined  in  the
                       Constitution.


                  (c)   There  were  no  boundary  markers  separating   the
                       community and the SANDF. As  a  result,  when  cattle
                       from the  community  strayed  into  the  SANDF  area,
                       anyone trying to retrieve them would be  arrested  or
                       the animals killed.


                  (d)   Some  family  members  got  killed  or   maimed   by
                       uncleared ammunition, and there was  no  compensation
                       from the SANDF.


                  (e)  The members of the  community  were  not  allowed  to
                       come in or go out when the  SANDF  was  in  training.
                       This caused unnecessary delay when pensioners  needed
                       to go out to collect their money.


                  (f)  The nearest  water  collection  point  and  telephone
                       were about 40km away.


                  The community demanded the following:


                  -    Retention of grazing rights in times of  drought,  if
                       the community was settled elsewhere.


                  -    Members of the community should be allowed  to  visit
                       the burial sites of their fathers and mothers.


                  -    An alternative  gate  must  be  opened  to  make  the
                       distance to the nearest town shorter.


                  -    A percentage of the income from the School should  be
                       given to the community.


         5. Groenwater and Skeifontein


              (1) Historical background


                  Groenwater  was  about  2Â 900  ha   in   size,   with   76
                  households, but that number was  growing  rapidly  due  to
                  people  invading  the  site.  The  title  deed  for   both
                  communities was handed over to the CPA. Skeifontein was  a
                  settlement of about 3Â 200 ha, with 500 households.


              (2) Findings


                  The area in which these communities were  settled,  was  a
                  barren piece of land next to an abandoned  asbestos  mine.
                  There  was  no  agricultural  potential  because  of   the
                  dryness of the area. The community raised,  among  others,
                  the following concerns:


                  (a)  Lack of  transport  system  -  there  are  no  proper
                       roads.


                  (b)  Lack of health facilities - the nearest clinic is  48
                       km away; a mobile clinic comes  only  once  a  month;
                       pensioners have difficulty reaching the clinic.


                  (c)  Housing is inadequate.


                  (d)  No schools - the nearest school is 25  km  away;  the
                       community was promised a temporary  school,  but  the
                       promise was never fulfilled.


                  (e)  Crime - the nearest police station is 48 km away.


                  (f)  The land was never developed after the community  had
                       moved in.


                  (g)   Lack   of   unity   is   hampering   any   envisaged
                       development.


         6. Visit to Smitsdrif


              (1) Historical background


                  In Smitsdrif there are 2Â 000  households  on  an  area  of
                  about 34 000 ha. The Smitsdrif claim is one of the  claims
                  inherited by the Commission on Restitution of Land  Rights
                  from ACLA in 1995.


              (2) Process


                  The claim was one of the  presidential  lead  projects  in
                  1994. Batlaping community initially lodged the claim.  The
                  Commission verified  the  claim  and  declared  it  valid.
                  Before  the  claim  could  be  settled,  the  Griqua   and
                  Fonteintjie  communities  lodged   a   counter-claim,   so
                  verification of the claim had  to  be  done.  Negotiations
                  took place between Batlaping and Fonteintjie and  resulted
                  in the two coming together to form the  Communal  Property
                  Association (CPA).  An  agreement  on  the  resolution  of
                  Griqua claims and  compensation  has  been  reached,  with
                  Griqua parties accepting alternative land. The way  should
                  now be clear for reaching final settlement.


              (3) Findings


                  There was a critical need  for  a  new  planning  process,
                  after the failure of Asch and Associates to  complete  the
                  task satisfactorily. There was some debate as  to  whether
                  Asch  and  Associates  complied  with  the  terms  of  the
                  contract, and about what to do  with  it.  The  provincial
                  land department  needs  to  give  clear  guidance  to  the
                  Department on the next step. The community settled on  the
                  SANDF  base  will  be  resettled   at   Platfontein.   The
                  Platfontein plan has been submitted by the  consultant  to
                  the Department. It will be reviewed by the land reform co-
                  ordinating  subcommittee  at  a  special   meeting.   Some
                  services such as water and  sanitation  are  essential  if
                  resettlement is to take place.  Resettlement  of  the  !Xu
                  and  Khwe  is  seen  by  many   as   a   prerequisite   to
                  resettlement of Smitsdrif.


         7. Recommendations


              Taking into consideration the information gathered during  the
              visit, the Committee recommends as follows:


              (1) There should be a close working relationship  between  the
                  provincial commissioner  and  the  community  involved  in
                  land restitution.


              (2) More resources  should  be  allocated  to  strengthen  the
                  process.


              (3)  Vacancies  should  be  filled,  to  have  the   personnel
                  resources necessary for the process.


         8. Latest developments


              The Minister of Agriculture, Ms Thoko Didiza, the  Chief  Land
              Claims Commissioner, Adv W A  Mgoqi,  and  the  Regional  Land
              Claims  Commissioner,  MrÂ AÂ AÂ Roberts,  signed  an   agreement
              between the claimants and the SANDF on 8 April 2000.


              A breakthrough was achieved  on  5  February  1999,  when  the
              different parties signed a framework agreement. The Bathlaping
              (Tswanas) and the Kleinfontein community  jointly  formed  the
              Smitsdrif CPA. The United Griquas  of  Griqualand  West  split
              into two groups, the Engelbrechts and the  Hoogstanders,  who,
              after several meetings, agreed to work together to settle  the
              claim amicably. Another Griqua group, the  House  of  Griquas,
              has also subsequently lodged a claim in resepct of  Smitsdrif.
              On 14 January 2000, an agreement was signed by  the  House  of
              Griquas and the United Griquas of Griqualand West, stating co-
              operation to settle the claim.


              After more than five years of negotiations, an  agreement  was
              reached with the SANDF,  which  encompassed  the  clearing  of
              dangerous objects, such as unexploded  ammunition,  and  time-
              frames for the departure of the SANDF from the  28Â 509,245  ha
              of land, being restored to the Smitsdrif CPA. The breakthrough
              was achieved when  the  SANDF  indicated  that  they  did  not
              require compensatory land for the land being restored  to  the
              claimants. The agreement included restoration of land and  the
              community gaining access to the discretionary grants from  the
              Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs.


     C.     Free State


         1. Visit to Thaba Patchoa
              (1) Historical background


                  Direct descendants of the families who owned the  land  in
                  terms of  title  deeds  lodged  the  claim.  The  original
                  owners had registered freehold rights  and  had  used  the
                  land  for  grazing,  for  subsistence  farming   and   for
                  residential purposes. The claimants had the right  to  the
                  land in terms of section 2(1) of the Restitution  of  Land
                  Right Act, 1994. The claim came from about four  families,
                  who were the owners,  and  about  62  families,  who  were
                  sharecroppers.


                  The Masisi, Mabokela,  Khuzwayo  and  Tsimatsima  families
                  occupied the land since 1905. They lost  their  rights  to
                  the land after their farms were  declared  "black  spots".
                  The logical  option  under  such  a  proclamation  was  to
                  either  sell  the  land  to  white  farmers  or  risk  the
                  property  being  expropriated.  The  farm  Tshiamelo   and
                  Segogoana's Valley were sold in 1974, while Sweethome  was
                  sold in 1978.
              (2) Process


                  Mr Kabelo Tsimatsima lodged the  claim  with  the  Eastern
                  Cape and Free State Land Claims Commission  on  behalf  of
                  the Masisi, Tsimatsima, Mabokela  and  Khuzwayo  families.
                  The claimants were direct descendants of  these  families,
                  who occupied  an  area  known  as  Tshiamelo,  Segogoana's
                  Valley and Sweethome (all being part  of  Thaba  Patchoa).
                  The claim was lodged in accordance with the provisions  of
                  section 11(1) and (2) of the Restitution  of  Land  Rights
                  Act, 1994, and section  25(3)  of  the  Constitution.  The
                  claim was gazetted on 26 August 1996.


                  The Regional Land Claims Commissioner,  on  the  basis  of
                  prima facie evidence,  pronounced  the  claim  valid.  The
                  claimants were interested  in  restoration  of  rights  in
                  land  on  the  farms.  Although  the   families   received
                  monetary  compensation  when  they  were  dispossessed  of
                  their farms, they argued that it was not  adequate.  Under
                  normal circumstances, their farms could have netted  more,
                  had they been sold in the open market. The  sharecroppers,
                  who also lost  their  rights  to  use  the  land,  as  per
                  arrangement with the original farm owner, were  interested
                  in upgraded rights, in the form of alternative land.


              (3) Findings


                  During  the  meeting  with  the  claimants,  led   by   Mr
                  Tsimatsima, the community raised the following concerns:


                  (a)  The process has been delayed for too long.


                  (b)  Some of the members of  the  community  were  against
                       the claim, which created unnecessary delays.


                  (c)  There must be time-frames for negotiations.
                  (d)  Plans  that  serve  as  guidelines  for  negotiations
                       between the Department and the claimants should be in
                       place.


                  The Department was committed to reaching  an  out-of-court
                  settlement with the claimants. Any position taken  by  the
                  Department was not binding until a  formal  agreement  was
                  signed by duly mandated officials of all parties.


         2. Visit to Bethany


              (1) Background


                  The community of Bethany was removed from  their  land  in
                  1965. After lengthy  negotiations,  an  agreement  between
                  the Lutheran Church, the Department and the  claimant  was
                  signed. The  right  of  the  community  to  the  land  was
                  restored. On 19 November  1998,  the  court  endorsed  the
                  restoration and ordered the establishment of the CPA.  The
                  court also ordered that a title  deed  be  issued  to  the
                  community within 90 days.


              (2) Findings
                  During the meeting  with  the  community  representatives,
                  the following issues were raised:


                  (a)  There has  been  no  visible  development  since  the
                       community was restored on the land.


                  (b)   The  court   recommended   to   the   Minister   for
                       Agriculture and Land Affairs that  Bethany  be  given
                       priority access to State resources allocated for land
                       development.


                  (c)  The community was supposed to be issued with a  title
                       deed within a period of  90  days,  but  a  year  has
                       lapsed without such title deed  being  issued.  After
                       repeated enquiries, the community was told  that  the
                       processing of registration was the  business  of  the
                       Lutheran Church and had nothing to do with the CPA.


                  (d)  The community was left with no  choice  but  to  seek
                       help from the Public Protector, and they  were  still
                       awaiting a reply from him.


                  (e)  The community believed that the Lutheran  Church  was
                       part of the land restitution  process  and  therefore
                       accountable to all parties concerned.


                  (f)  There was no pre-project funding from the  Department
                       for the community.


                  (g)  Staff handling the case in the provincial  department
                       changed all the time, which resulted  in  a  lack  of
                       continuity.


                  (h)  An independent monitoring agent  should  oversee  the
                       case.
         3. Latest development


              The Bethany community was ultimately issued with  their  title
              deeds during a ceremony held on 21 March 2000.


         4. Visit to Moroka's Hoek/Groothoek


              (1) Background


                  The claimants were the persons or  their  descendants  who
                  were removed from the  area.  Sun  International  built  a
                  casino and a hotel on the land, and they have a  long-term
                  notarial lease agreement  with  a  parastatal.  The  claim
                  comprised  about  90  families  from  Groothoek   and   30
                  families from Moroka's Hoek.


              (2) Findings


                  The  claimants  were  mainly   interested   in   financial
                  compensation. The Department is committed in  reaching  an
                  out-of-court settlement  that  will  be  accepted  to  all
                  parties involved. A valuation  has  been  commissioned  to
                  determine the value of rights lost in monetary terms.  The
                  community was happy with the way the  claim  was  handled.
                  Their main concern was the delay in settling it.


         5. Meeting with Herschel claimants


              (1) Background


                  The claim concerned a property known as Palmietfontein  No
                  16, made up of  trust  villages,  namely  Musong,  Mahedi,
                  Storomo, Hohobeng and Makalakaleng. Palmietfontein  No  16
                  was originally  part  of  Ciskei.  The  claimant  was  the
                  community of Herschel, which had registered rights in  the
                  form of "Permission to Occupy".  They  had  lived  on  the
                  land for longer than 10 years prior to dispossession.  The
                  claimants had residential and communal grazing  rights  on
                  the arable land.


                  In 1975 Herschel was excised from  Ciskei  and  classified
                  as part of Transkei. The inhabitants were forced to  move,
                  as they were not  in  support  of  the  Transkei  homeland
                  government.  This  position  was  seen  as  tantamount  to
                  challenging the whole  separate  development  policy,  and
                  thus  those  who  adopted  this  position  were  allegedly
                  victimised and subsequently removed.  The  claimants  were
                  initially relocated to Zastron, Phuthaditshaba  and  later
                  Botshabelo's Section N.


                  The  claimants  indicated   that   no   compensation   was
                  received. The  land  they  were  promised  by  the  QwaQwa
                  homeland  government,  was  not  meant  for  the   removed
                  families as a form of compensation,  but  to  augment  the
                  land shortage in Phuthaditshaba. When the  claimants  were
                  relocated to Phuthaditshaba,  they  were  allocated  sites
                  like everybody else. They were expected to provide  labour
                  for the erection of State-owned  houses.  For  this,  they
                  were not paid, as promised. The only  form  of  assistance
                  received,  was  transport  of  their  belongings  by   the
                  government to Botshabelo.


              (2) Findings


                  The  community  of  Herschel  was  exposed  to  harsh  and
                  difficult conditions. The area  they  occupied,  was  dry,
                  with  no  agricultural  potential.  The  state  of   their
                  makeshift houses was appalling. The houses  were  cold  in
                  winter  and  hot  in  summer.  The  community   told   the
                  Committee that  the  Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Land
                  Affairs promised  them  that  by  the  next  winter  their
                  condition would improve. Two winters have come  and  gone,
                  with nothing forthcoming. The community alleged that  they
                  were  forced  by  the  local  council  to  pay  for  water
                  services, which they did not receive. They had to  walk  a
                  long distance to get water.


         6. Recommendations
              The Committee is of the  view  that  the  recommendations  put
              forward for the Northern Cape visit should also apply  in  the
              Free State's case.


     D.     Northern Province


         The visit took place from 12 to 13 November  1999.  The  delegation
         consisted of three members, Rev P Moatshe (Chairperson), Chief M  L
         Mokoena and Mr R M Nyakane.


         1. Meeting at Agrivillage, Pietersburg


              The delegation held a  meeting  at  Agrivillage,  Pietersburg,
              with  the  following  people:  Dr  A   Motsoaledi,   MEC   for
              Agriculture, Land and  Environmental  Affairs;  Dr  H  Mateme,
              Chairperson of the Land and Environmental  Affairs  Committee;
              Ms R Semenya, committee member; Mr S Mhinga,  Deputy  Director
              of the Department of Agriculture, Land and Environment; and Mr
              T Makhubele, Public Relations Officer of the Department.
              Dr Mateme gave a brief overview of the land claims problems in
              the Province. She said the amalgamation of  land  from  former
              homeland governments and the new South African government  was
              also one of the problems.


              Dr Motsoaledi said the fact that Mpumalanga and  the  Northern
              Province were served by the same office of the Commission, was
              also a problem. It was one of  the  causes  of  the  delay  in
              settling land claims. The office had only one field worker for
              both provinces, and was dealing with communities which did not
              have  basic  telecommunication  facilities  like   faxes   and
              telephones, thus the field worker had to drive around all  the
              time.


              The  delegation,  together  with  the  provincial   officials,
              proceeded to Mmaboi to meet with the communities.


         2. Meeting with communities at Mmaboi
              Dr Mateme introduced the guests, and Dr Motsoaledi  made  some
              opening remarks before handing over Rev Moatshe, who addressed
              the communities on behalf of the Committee. He said  that  the
              Committee had agreed to embark on a country-wide, fact-finding
              mission in respect of land claims.


              Various  communities   attended   the   meeting,   and   their
              representatives gave input, as follows:


              (1) Mmaboi


                  Mr P Mojapelo said they had been evicted from  their  land
                  in 1926. In 1937 they started to discuss the problem as  a
                  community.  In  1975-76  Germans  gave  them   money   and
                  promised them a piece of land on which they could  discuss
                  tribal issues.


                  In 1994 they were issued  forms  to  complete,  but  as  a
                  result of improper completion of those  forms,  they  were
                  asked to complete them again.
                  At that stage several farms were  available  for  purchase
                  (e.g.  Makereng).  The  matter   was   reported   to   the
                  Department, who told them that it  would  be  referred  to
                  Pretoria,  as  the  Department  did  not  deal  with  land
                  claims. Since then, they have never heard anything.


                  In August 1997 the matter was again taken to  Pietersburg,
                  where they were told that the matter was being handled  by
                  Ms Gillfillan, the Commissioner. They demanded a  copy  of
                  the letter in order  to  speed  up  the  process.  It  was
                  discovered that the farm had been sold  to  a  certain  Mr
                  Lotter, therefore the redistribution route which they  had
                  followed, did not bear any fruit.


                  The process was too slow, and they found  that  the  farm-
                  owner was willing to sell  the  property  to  anyone  with
                  hard cash.


              (2) Makotopong
                  Mr Sathege said that their farm name had been known as  No
                  151 Roedevaal, which was subsequently changed  to  No  808
                  Roedevaal. They had lived there since 1870, and they  were
                  ruled  by  Chief  Abraham   Phambane.   Every   individual
                  possessed a title deed for the plot he or she owned.  They
                  stayed there with the Germans from whom  they  had  bought
                  the farm. In 1960 the Germans told them that they were  no
                  longer supposed to stay there. In 1966  one  Gilford  told
                  them that their land had been expropriated for use by  the
                  SADF. During that period  they  lost  their  property  and
                  livestock.


                  In 1996 the first claim  was  lodged  in  Pretoria,  where
                  they were told to form a committee. They  were  offered  a
                  piece of land with agricultural potential, but  they  said
                  that the land was not sufficient when compared  with  what
                  they used to own. They argued  that  they  were  not  well
                  compensated by the  government  and  that  the  government
                  still owed them mineral rights. The  community  wanted  to
                  take the matter  to  the  Supreme  Court  if  it  was  not
                  reconsidered.


              (3) Pheeha


                  This community was represented by Mr Herman Malatjie,  and
                  they were claiming nine farms. They  complained  that  the
                  government was delaying the process,  and  indicated  that
                  if they could be given their land  back,  there  would  be
                  job opportunities in the area.


                  The Rietloop farm-owner did not allow them  on  his  land,
                  and some of their livestock went missing on that farm.


                  They pleaded that  both  provinces  should  have  separate
                  land  commissions.  They  claimed  the  following   farms:
                  Boshuishoek; Baskloof;  Nooitgedacht;  Dashoek;  Rietloop;
                  Tierkloof; Koggelfontein; Bronkhorstfontein; Goudplaas.


              (4) Popela


                  Mr Jan Maake talked on  behalf  of  this  community.  They
                  used to live on Boomplaas,  which  has  been  consolidated
                  with the Goedgelegen farm. They  started  living  on  that
                  farm in the 18th century under Chief  Pheehane  Maake  and
                  later Chief Popela. In 1900, during the war,  the  English
                  asked the Chief for a piece of land to stay on, and  asked
                  some community members to help them  by  doing  farm  work
                  without pay.


                  In 1968 legislation stipulating that farm workers  had  to
                  be paid, was enacted.


                  In 1993 the Wesfalia Company  took  away  their  land  and
                  started to impose restrictions on them. They were told  to
                  get rid of their livestock and to stop  ploughing.  People
                  were forced to live in hostels.


                  In 1996 they started to lodge  a  land  claim.  They  were
                  told to form a committee to speed up the process.


                  They were encountering problems with the TLC,  and  wished
                  to be helped as soon as possible.


              (5) Mondi Scholtz


                  Mr Simon Makgoba represented this community. He said  that
                  they were living there in 1965 with his  grandfather,  who
                  was an induna at the time.  He  started  working  for  the
                  Scholtz company in 1993, when Scholtz  wanted  to  have  a
                  business partnership with Mondi, as he was afraid  of  the
                  coming democratic elections. In  1995  Mondi  and  Scholtz
                  retrenched workers with the aim of evicting them from  the
                  farm. In 1998 Mondi told them that  they  had  bought  the
                  company from Scholtz and  that  by  November  the  company
                  would be closing down.  They  were  also  told  to  remove
                  roofing and window-frames from  their  houses  within  two
                  months, to assist with the demolition process.


                  During demolition their dwellings and some of  the  graves
                  were destroyed, for which they were  not  compensated.  Mr
                  Makgoba said this was done because the owners of the  farm
                  wanted them to vote for the National Party.


                  They  also  complained  that  they  had  been   forcefully
                  removed from Makgoeba,  and  they  had  already  lodged  a
                  claim in this regard. Initially they  tried  to  take  the
                  matter to  the  police  and  later  approached  the  Nkuzi
                  Development Association for help.


                  They suggested that, since they had  nowhere  to  go,  the
                  RDP should have built houses for them.


              (6) Dikgale


                  Mr Wund Dikgale talked on behalf of this  community.  They
                  started with land redistribution in 1997  and  1998,  with
                  the help of the Nkuzi Development Association.


                  Northern Transvaal  Motors  was  approached,  and  it  was
                  determined  that  there  were  four  farms  available  for
                  purchase (portion of Rietpoel). The Department  told  them
                  to form a group of 600 people, as each farm  was  expected
                  to have between 57 and 87 people.


                  In terms of issuing  land,  the  focus  was  only  on  the
                  unemployed and people who  earned  less  than  R1Â 000  per
                  month.


                  They complained that the officials were not  telling  them
                  the truth about the new land laws.  They  said  the  farm-
                  owner told them that,  by  the  year  2000,  he  would  be
                  selling the farm.


              (7) Nkuzi Development Association


                  Mr  Lahiff  made  a  presentation  on   behalf   of   this
                  association. It is an NGO active  in  the  areas  of  land
                  reform and land rights in the Northern  Province,  and  is
                  an affiliate of the  National  Land  Committee.  Over  the
                  previous  two  years,  it  had  assisted  more  that   400
                  Northern Province communities to  lodge  land  restitution
                  claims, and had  advised  many  others  on  how  to  lodge
                  claims directly with the Commission.


                  Mr Edward Lahiff explained that in the  Northern  Province
                  there were about 11 000 claims with  the  Commission,  but
                  that only two had  been  dealt  with.  He  said  that  the
                  process  took   too   long,   and   made   the   following
                  recommendations:


                  (a)  Short-term recommendations


                       The Commission should open offices in every province.


                       The   Commission   should   meet   with    provincial
                       stakeholders, and later with  district  stakeholders,
                       to develop a strategy for resolving  land  claims  in
                       each province.


                       The moratorium on redistribution projects  should  be
                       lifted, as no alternative is in place.


                       The current  planning  processes  for  redistribution
                       should be dropped in favour of genuine  participatory
                       planning   that   addresses   the   real   needs   of
                       communities.


                       Police,  magistrates  and   prosecutors   should   be
                       informed  of  the  provisions  of  the  Extension  of
                       Security Tenure Act, and their performance should  be
                       monitored by the Department.


                       The Department should intervene directly in cases  of
                       threatened evictions or abuse of farm residents.


                       The  Extension  of  Security  Tenure  Act  should  be
                       amended  to  allow  for  the  burial   of   long-term
                       residents on farms and  the  protection  of  NGO  and
                       union representatives.


                  (b)  Long-term recommendations


                       Local planning involving all  relevant  stakeholders,
                       especially  elected   local   councils,   should   be
                       initiated in order to co-ordinate and  integrate  all
                       aspects of land reform.


                       Provincial  agriculture   departments   should   work
                       together more closely with provincial offices of  the
                       Department to plan and deliver  agricultural  support
                       to land reform beneficiaries.


                       The government should develop a clear vision for land
                       reform,  with  measurable  performance  targets,  and
                       should act decisively when  its  objectives  are  not
                       being met.


                       The Department should publish its recommendations and
                       encourage public  debate  on  tenure  reform  in  the
                       former homelands.


                       The Department and the Commission should move towards
                       decentralising   decision-making,   at    least    at
                       provincial level, so that the Minister may no  longer
                       be required to approve every project in person.


                       Emerging black commercial farmers should be  provided
                       with preferential access to Land Bank loans and other
                       support services.


                       The law needs to be strengthened to  provide  secure,
                       permanent tenure rights to all long-term occupiers of
                       State, private and communal land.


                       The procedures for investigating and settling  claims
                       need to be drastically reduced,  and  the  Commission
                       should be given powers to settle claims  without  the
                       agreement of current owners.


         5. Meeting with Commissioner in Venda


              Present were Dr Motsoaledi; Dr Mateme; Ms R Semenya, member of
              the Standing Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs;  Rev
              Moatshe; Chief Mokoena; Mr R M Nyakane; Mr  S  Mhinga,  Deputy
              Director of the Department; Mr T Makhubele,  Public  Relations
              Officer  of  the   Department   of   Agriculture,   Land   and
              Environment; Ms D  Gilfillan,  Regional  Commissioner  of  the
              Commission; and Mr D Vorster, fieldworker for the Commission.


              Ms Gilfillan made a presentation on the Commission's progress.
              She started with a brief overview  of  the  situation  in  her
              office in March 1997, when she was without staff,  except  for
              two members. Now she has about 34 staff members,  of  whom  18
              are co-functionary staff (those who work on  claims  at  field
              level). The office has no permanent staff  except  for  purely
              administrative work. Most staff  members  are  employed  on  a
              three-year contract. Therefore the office has  to  readvertise
              every three years.


              The Northern Province has about 5Â 000 claims,  most  of  which
              are rural.


              All these claims are based on informal rights (rights that are
              not registered), and precedence  is  needed  in  this  regard.
              Although  in  respect  of  some  claims  actual  ownership  is
              obviously feasible, the courts do need some form  of  material
              evidence.  Most  of  the  evidence  is  oral  and   from   the
              communities, based on  hearsay  (for  example,  the  claim  in
              respect  of  Kranspoort  Community   farm,   west   of   Louis
              Trichardt). This farm was bought  by  a  certain  Hofmeyer  in
              1879, and was donated to children, as black  people  were  not
              allowed as labour  tenants.  Missionaries  stayed  there.  The
              claim is opposed by the present owners of the farm. As far  as
              the Department is concerned, the claim was valid. It  involved
              about 600 families, and was  referred  to  court.  The  church
              contested everything and  the  hearing  took  two  weeks.  The
              Commission was  still  awaiting  the  outcome.  Officials  who
              attested documents were no longer around. Because of this type
              of evidence, only a few claims will succeed in court.


              Ms Gilfillan said that once  the  claim  goes  to  court,  the
              Commission loses control over it and the lawyers take over.


              She said there were also active claims which  they  were  busy
              with, and that they hoped to be finished at the end  of  March
              2000. One of these was a claim for the Madimbo Corridor, State
              land that used to be owned by the  SADF.  Some  claims,  about
              1Â 004, have been validated in respect of the Northern Province
              and Mpumalanga.


              Only five claims have been finalised; 39 have  been  dismissed
              on  the  grounds  of  falling  outside  the  criteria  of  the
              Restitution Act. These were claims in respect of which  people
              were compensated. According to  this,  claimants  claimed  the
              land on which they were residing, but did not have rights  to.
              They were never removed from that land - all they wanted,  was
              the title deed.


              Claims lodged  in  terms  of  tribal  jurisdiction  were  also
              dismissed on the grounds that they fell outside  the  criteria
              of  the  Restitution  Act  and  should  be  handled   by   the
              Constitutional Court, as the  Commission  had  no  power  over
              them.


              The communities whose claims were  dismissed,  were  furnished
              with full reasons  for  dismissal  and  were  advised  of  the
              options available.


              The majority of the claims were delayed because they  were  in
              respect of privately owned land. Some of the  land  was  State
              land, and the delay was caused by the fact that there  were  a
              number  of  departments  involved.  For  example,  the  Kruger
              National Park in Mpumalanga involved the Departments of Public
              Works, Land Affairs and Defence.


     E.     Eastern Cape


         1. Introduction


              The delegation undertook the study tour from 12 to 13 November
              1999. The delegation comprised of Ms B Thompson  (ANC),  Ms  B
              Dlulane (ANC), Ms S Gqabaza (Committee  Secretary)  and  Ms  K
              Pasiya (Committee Assistant).


         2. Purpose of tour
              The tour was a fact-finding mission in respect of land  claims
              and restitution.


              The delegation arrived at Commissioner Tozi  Ngwanya's  office
              and was welcomed by him and three members  of  the  Provincial
              Legislature: Mr R Nogumla, Mr A Metele and Mr M  Makalima,  as
              well as Mr N Yankee, deputy director of the department.


         3. Visit to Elliot Farms


              At Elliot the delegation met with  community  leaders  and  Mr
              Ndunge, one of the people affected during the forced removals.
              Ms Thompson gave a short briefing about  the  purpose  of  the
              visit, and on how the government  can  assist  in  respect  of
              their threats, difficulties, fears and expectations,  so  that
              they can get their land back. The delegation  wanted  to  know
              whether the Commissioner's office was helping them.


              The Commissioners' office explained that the  Ndunge  families
              managed to get their land back through his  office;  the  only
              delay was the process of settlement. They have to plan  grants
              whereby service providers and micro-agents will have to assist
              them by getting subsidies. They mentioned  that  there  was  a
              commitment from the MEC's office of an  agricultural  planning
              programme and after-care services.


              The Commissioner's office also expressed frustration that  the
              policy did not substantiate about the land.  They  recommended
              that the restitution law be amended because there was no  room
              for development. They mentioned that the MEC was faced with  a
              challenge in respect of those farms with a view to  settlement
              support and development  division.  A  spokesperson  from  the
              department, Mr Yankee, said that there  was  an  agreement  in
              principle between the Department and the local housing  board.
              They mentioned that 28 miles away maize, mealies, cabbage  and
              potatoes  were  produced,  and  that  there  were   still   55
              households that had to get their land back.


              The delegation recommended that different  committees  in  the
              province  intervene  to  facilitate  the  process.  They  also
              mentioned  that  the  province  has  set  a  pattern  on  land
              restitution  for  other  provinces  to  follow.   Mr   Sokweba
              expressed appreciation for the effort of  the  government  and
              for the progress made in Elliot.


         4.  Visit  to  Grahamstown:  Eastern  Cape  Agricultural   Research
              Project (ECARP)


              The delegation met  with  the  director  of  ECARP  and  staff
              members, as well as community leaders from Farmer  Field,  and
              the Commissioner introduced the delegation. The director  gave
              an  introductory  briefing  on  ECARP,  an  organisation  that
              facilitates land and farm projects.


              The chairperson of the  Farm  Field  Trust,  Mr  Mbali  Mzizi,
              expressed the frustration about their expectations  not  being
              met. He complained that people were promised from 1997-98 that
              something would be built for them, but that up to  that  point
              nothing  had  been  done.  He  complained  about  a  lack   of
              communication between them and the Commissioners'  office.  He
              said they had been requesting reports from the office, with no
              response.


              The Commissioner responded by  saying  that  they  had  had  a
              funding problem with regard to things like training people  in
              farming skills. He said the national government  had  to  take
              responsibility for the settlement of families and agricultural
              cultivation, and that the Commission did not have resources to
              fund these. He said they should work together on these issues,
              as  the  Department,  the  Commissioners'   office   and   the
              community, and that the Restoration Act had to be amended.


              The delegation appreciated the  constructive  criticism.  They
              suggested a follow-up with the Commissioners' office, and that
              they would see to it that legislation  was  put  in  place  to
              speed up the process.


         5. Recommendations


              The delegation agreed to go back to Parliament  and  recommend
              an amendment of the Restoration Act, so that the settlement of
              families  and  the  agricultural  planning  process  could  be
              covered.


     F.     Mpumalanga


         1. Introduction


              In view of the fact that the Committee plays an important role
              in ensuring that dispossessed communities are given back their
              land through land reform, it resolved,  at  a  meeting  on  30
              August 1999, to send a delegation  to  the  Tenbosch  and  the
              Doornkop communities in Mpumalanga. The purpose of  the  visit
              was to see -


              (1)  progress  made  with  regard  to  land  claims  in  these
                  communities;


              (2) problems experienced by the communities; and


              (3) how Parliament can assist in speeding up the  land  claims
                  process.


              The delegation, under  the  leadership  of  Mr  M  L  Mokoena,
              included Mr R M Nyakane. Mr  Taabe  was  unable  to  join  the
              delegation, due to other commitments.


              Mr D D Mabuza, the MEC for Housing  and  Land  Administration,
              accompanied    the    delegation.    Departmental    officials
              accompanying the delegation were  Mr  J  M  Mndawe,  from  the
              Office of the Premier; Ms G N Sibeko; Mr Edward; Mr G  Fraser;
              Mr B M Dry; Mr E M Khoza; Mr D P  Mbiba;  Bukhosi  BakaMlambo,
              chairperson of the House of Traditional Leaders; Mr A van  der
              Merwe, Head: National Housing and Administration  Office;  and
              Mr M Mudau, Councillor: Office of the Director-General.


         2. Visit to Tenbosch


              (1) Overview of Tenbosch restitution claims


                  The Tenbosch land claims dated back  to  the  1950s,  when
                  communities in the area known as  Tenbosch  were  forcibly
                  removed  to  make  way  for  the  establishment  of  white
                  commercial farmers in the  area.  Tenbosch  community  has
                  about  five  traditional  authorities,  Mhlaba,  Siboshwa,
                  Hoyi, Lugedlane, Shongwe, of which three  (Hoyi,  Siboshwa
                  and Lugedlane) have lodged claims  with  the  Land  Claims
                  Court. The farm Tenbosch, as it was  known  in  1953,  was
                  nearly 30Â 000 ha in extent. The claimants  were  relocated
                  to inferior  land  in  the  Nkomazi  area  of  the  former
                  KaNgwane.


                  At this stage, the Commission has  completed  its  initial
                  investigation of the land claim, and  has  concluded  that
                  the claim was prima facie valid, in terms  of  section  11
                  of  the  Restitution  of  Land  Rights   Act,   1994.   An
                  investigation was being conducted to identify  members  of
                  the claimant community - persons removed from Tenbosch  or
                  their  direct  descendants.  This  involved   a   detailed
                  mapping project to record land use patterns  on  the  farm
                  prior to dispossession, as that information was needed  in
                  order to resolve the claim.


                  The claim involved unregistered rights  in  land,  as  the
                  claimants were not given title to  the  land.  The  formal
                  dispossession in 1951 was effected in terms of the  Native
                  Trust  and  Land   Act   of   1936.   The   Commissioner's
                  investigations were  to  be  broadened  to  include  areas
                  surrounding Tenbosch.


              (2) Land claimed


                  The land claimed, is Tenbosch  162JU,  with  about  10Â 000
                  people.


              (3) Progress since visit


                  An information meeting was  held  between  representatives
                  of the land-owners and  representatives  of  the  claimant
                  community, the  Land  Claims  Court  and  the  Department.
                  During that meeting the spirit of co-operation led  to  an
                  agreement  that  a  solution  be  found  to  address   the
                  injustice created by the removal of the community  in  the
                  1950s.


                  It  was  agreed  that  the   Department   would   act   as
                  facilitator and expedite the process so as  to  allow  the
                  Commissioner to execute her duties. It was  expected  that
                  the  process  would  take  considerable  time   to   reach
                  finality.


              (4) Problems experienced, and findings


                  (a)  According to the community, the land  claims  process
                       was very slow. Over  the  previous  five  years,  the
                       Commission had  ignored  rural  communities  and  had
                       focused more on urban areas.


                  (b)  On 30 July 1999 it was published in the Gazette  that
                       landowners should not sell or  exchange  their  land.
                       Allegations were made that there were certain  people
                       who continue to sell their land.


                  (c)  The community  complained  that  the  last  time  the
                       Tenbosch Community had a meeting with the  Committee,
                       was in December 1997. They  urged  the  Committee  to
                       visit the community more often.


                  (d)  Some people did not have title deeds.


                  (e)   White  farmers  wanted   to   sell   land   to   the
                       communities, and the communities refuse to  buy  land
                       that they believed was theirs.
                       The chairperson of the Tenbosch Land Claims Community
                       informed the meeting that there was consensus between
                       the Commission and the  community.  They  had  agreed
                       that there was no need to fight for  land,  and  that
                       negotiations between parties  concerned  should  take
                       place to expedite the land claims process.


                       In November 1999, the Commission were  to  meet  with
                       land-owners  and  claimants  to  negotiate  on   land
                       redistribution, land tenure and restitution.


              (5) Recommendations


                  (a)  The MEC should find a way  of  exerting  pressure  on
                       the land claims process.


                  (b)   Farmers,  land-owners  and   the   landless   should
                       negotiate and find consensus on  issues  they  differ
                       on.


                  (c)  The community recommended that the government  should
                       interact more with them, to keep them abreast of  the
                       processes.


         3. Visit to Doornkop Community


              (1) Overview of restitution claim


                  The Doornkop community's occupation of portion 12  of  the
                  farm Doornkop 246 JS dated back to 1905, when their  chief
                  and 283 others purchased  the  property  from  Mr  J  N  R
                  Joubert. In 1968 the State expropriated the property  from
                  the Doornkop community, and forced  removals  occurred  in
                  1970.  The  community  was  compensated   with   land   in
                  Bothashoek. The land was given to the SAPS to be  used  as
                  a training facility and for recreational purposes, by  the
                  previous government.


              (2) Land claimed


                  The Minister approved  the  return  of  the  community  in
                  1995, and the first people returned in December 1995.  The
                  SAPS   originally   demanded   compensation    for    this
                  improvement, and an agreement has not yet been reached.


                  The community claimed  portion  12  of  Doornkop,  in  the
                  Middelburg District.  At  present,  there  are  about  246
                  claimants.


              (3) Progress to date


                  The Doornkop Restitution Claim  was  a  presidential  lead
                  project.


                  (a)  The Commission submitted the claim to the Minister.


                  (b)  Negotiations were  held  with  Public  Works  on  the
                       transfer  of   land   to   the   community   property
                       association. The problem was that Public Works was of
                       the view that they needed a  mandate  from  the  Land
                       Claims Court to  effect  transfer.  The  matter  was,
                       however, in the hands of the provincial director, who
                       had been mandated by the Land Claims Court to seek  a
                       way forward.


                  (c)   Terms  of  reference  for  detailed  planning   were
                       drafted.


                  (d)  75 out  of  the  246  people  who  submitted  claims,
                       received their land back.


              (4) Problems experienced


                  (a)  In the community there is a  lack  of  infrastructure
                       to accommodate all 300 people who live  there.  Since
                       1994 there has been no development in the  community,
                       except for one school. The  school  did  not  have  a
                       water  supply,  electricity,  sanitation,  furniture,
                       offices,  etc.  The  community  complained  that  the
                       government   was   not   providing   the    necessary
                       infrastructure.
                  (b)    Difficulty   was   experienced   with   beneficiary
                       identification and unravelling the issues  pertaining
                       to those individuals who  preferred  compensation  to
                       restitution.


                  (c)  The influx of illegal squatters was  another  problem
                       experienced by the community. There were  about  five
                       illegal squatters, occupying land they did  not  own.
                       According to the  community,  the  squatters  claimed
                       that they owned the land, whilst they had "bought" it
                       through illegal means. The issue was referred to  the
                       MEC. The  community  suggested  that  the  Department
                       address the matter before there  was  bloodshed.  The
                       community notified the squatters  to  move  out,  but
                       they refused to leave.


                  (d)  Government officials were accused  of  being  corrupt
                       and misusing funds for their own personal benefit.
                  The community urged the provincial department  to  address
                  the following:


                  (i)  Registration of land (land is not registered.


                  (ii)  Title  deeds  -  they  were  taken  by  the   former
                         government, and people do not have title  deeds  to
                         the land they own.


                  (iii)       Boundaries  -  there  were  no  boundaries  to
                         separate land. The community did not have  an  idea
                         as to how big their land was. A map  needed  to  be
                         drawn.


                  (iv) Infrastructure - the government were to  provide  the
                         community  with  water  supply,   clinics,   roads,
                         transport, sanitation, electricity, etc. There were
                         taxi  associations  interested  in   operating   in
                         Doornkop, and the community was  scared  that  that
                         would result in taxi violence.  They  preferred  to
                         have buses operating in the area.


                  (v)  The community was informed that R2  million  was  set
                         aside for developing Doornkop, and yet, apart from
                         the school that was built, nothing had been done.


                  (vi)  The  processing  of  land  claims  was   slow.   The
                         community urged officials to speed up the process.


                  (vii)      Registration of  portion  12  had  to  be  done
                         immediately.


                  (viii)More land had to be identified and purchased by  the
                         government to accommodate the landless.


              (5) Findings


                  (a)  Counter-land claims were lodged by  those  who  owned
                       land privately.
                  (b)  The  community  was  not  aware  of  land  claims  in
                       dispute and of land claims that were processed.


                  (c)  The community was not aware  of  the  procedures  and
                       processes that had to be followed before land  claims
                       could be processed.


                  (d)  There were people who  sold  land  illegally  -  land
                       they did not own.


                  (e)  Squatters were assisted  by  being  informed  of  the
                       right procedures to follow in order to access land.


                  (f)  The community blamed the provincial government,  when
                       in fact the problem lied with local government.


                  (g)  The community was becoming impatient, and blamed  the
                       Commission for delaying the process.


              (6) Recommendations


                  (a)  An agreement has to be reached by those who  were  in
                       dispute for land. Land-owners and those without  land
                       need to reach agreement.


                  (b)  People have to be  informed  of  the  procedures  and
                       processes to be followed to ensure that land is given
                       to the rightful owners.


                  (c)  The government should deal with those who  sell  land
                       illegally.


                  (d)  The  R2  million  allocated  to  developing  Doornkop
                       should be used to develop infrastructure much  needed
                       in Doornkop.


                  (e)  The community should appeal to  different  ministries
                       to address their grievances, as different  ministries
                       have  to  assist  in  building  infrastructure.   For
                       example, with regard to  water  supply,  they  should
                       consult the Ministry of Water Affairs  and  Forestry.
                       With regard to  transport  (buses)  and  roads,  they
                       should consult the ministries  of  Transport  and  of
                       Public Works.


              (7) Progress since visit


                  An agreement was reached with the Land  Claims  Court  for
                  the Department to pursue the issue  of  land  transfer  on
                  behalf of the Commission.


                  Since the last time the Committee  had  visited  Doornkop,
                  the  influx  of  illegal  occupiers  increased,  and   the
                  situation has become extremely  volatile.  The  number  of
                  squatters has doubled.


         4. Conclusion


The provincial Department of Housing and Land Administration has much to do
for its communities in respect of land claims.
