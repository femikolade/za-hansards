                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Miss M N BUTHELEZI: Chairperson, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Durban Metro Council has set  aside  R200  million  to
       build proper and adequate houses for 11 000 families in Durban;


  (2) believes that this demonstrates the commitment of the ANC-led  Durban
       Metro Council to provide houses, security and  comfort  for  all  our
       people, thereby improving the quality of life for all, especially the
       poor; and


  (3) welcomes the bold move by the Durban Metro Council to provide  houses
       for the people.

Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting  day
of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note of  the  strong-arm  tactics  of  the  New  NP  leader  in
       demanding oaths of loyalty from New NP  Western  Cape  Ministers  who
       will otherwise lose their jobs;
  (2) recognises that a leader whose people will  not  follow  him  out  of
       conviction is not a leader but little more than a dictator; and


  (3) therefore calls on the New NP leader to listen to the  voice  of  the
       people and to let public representatives choose their  course  freely
       and according to their own conscience.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the IFP:

       phony roadblocks on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast have been  arrested
       and have appeared in court on charges of armed robbery;


  (2) congratulates the SA Police  Service  for  apprehending  the  alleged
       robbers;


  (3) questions why the alleged robbers were not also charged with  falsely
       representing police officers in terms of section 66 of the SA  Police
       Service Act or soldiers in terms of section 115 of the Defence Act;


  (4) acknowledges that the offence of falsely representing peace  officers
       is of a serious nature and should be rooted out at all levels; and


  (5) calls on the Minister of Safety and Security to take immediate action
       to stop this phenomenon.

Mr J H NASH: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:

       in public schools next year will arrive next month ...

Oh, it is 60 Cubans! I am sorry.


  (2) further notes that the intention  of  this  training  is  to  improve
       pupils' performance in science and mathematics;


  (3) believes that this programme reflects the ties of solidarity  between
       the people of Cuba and South Africa; and


  (4) commends the Cuban  internationalists  who  will  be  coming  to  our
       country  to  widen  our  skills  base  to  meet  the  challenges   of
       transformation.

Please note that it is not six: it is 60! [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! It was not  a  debate.  It  was
only a notice of motion. [Laughter.]

Dr P J RABIE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  almost 7 million people in South Africa face the predicament  of
           being unemployed;


       (b)  we dare not play petty politics and blindly criticise  from  the
           sideline while unemployment seriously affects the  lives  of  so
           many South Africans; and


       (c)  it is the responsibility  of  every  member  of  this  House  to
           enthusiastically and passionately help solve this burning issue,
           by  getting  involved  in  constructive  co-operation,   despite
           political differences; and


  (2) recognises the importance of working together to solve  unemployment,
       in order to realise our dream of a successful  and  prosperous  South
       Africa.

Mr C T FROLICK: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:

       children of South Africa;

       event that would be televised to an estimated 1 billion people in  60
       countries;


  (3) further notes that Soweto is the place where, in 1976, the  youth  of
       South Africa took it upon themselves to  indicate  their  displeasure
       with the circumstances under which they were growing up; and


  (4) calls on all South Africans to support  the  key  objectives  of  the
       organising committee in order  to  leave  a  legacy  of  a  volunteer
       culture in the country.

[Applause.]

Mr J T LOUW: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day

       provincial government of the Northern Cape unveiled plans for  a  new
       community service and skills development centre;


  (2) believes that the building of this new community service  and  skills
       development centre will contribute  significantly  to  improving  the
       lives of the people of Colesberg and will bring the Government closer
       to the people;


  (3) welcomes these plans; and


  (4) commends Madiba, the private sector and the provincial government for
       developing these plans.

[Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UCDP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes with compassion that -


       (a)  the Government's child social security programmes reach  only  a
           small portion of poor children, as according to a  recent  study
           by Idasa up to 30% of children are desperately poor  and  go  to
           bed hungry; and


       (b)  the two  programmes  through  which  delivery  is  concentrated,
           namely the child support grant and the care-dependency programme
           cater for only 12% of the estimated number of poor children; and


  (2) calls on the Government to live  up  to  the  levels  of  the  signed
       international treaties  which  give  children  the  right  to  social
       services, basic health and nutrition, basic housing and  shelter  and
       basic education by ensuring that it maintains a high  priority  value
       for child social security benefits.
Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Chairperson,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) believes that for democracy to prosper,  a  healthy  balance  between
       majority and opposition parties is necessary;


  (2) recognises that opposition to the Government cannot be effective from
       within the governing party;


  (3)  recommits  itself  to  government  that  is  principled,  efficient,
       accountable and transparent;


  (4) agrees that elected public representatives must serve  the  interests
       of their voters and not the interests of their pockets; and


  (5) calls on all public representatives to rededicate themselves  to  the
       delivery of services and hope to the homeless, the unemployed,  those
       living with HIV/Aids, the elderly and victims of crime.

[Applause.]

Prof B TUROK: Chairperson, on a point of order:  Is  it  in  order  for  one
member to give another one an ANC membership form?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, I will  leave  you,  after
Parliament has risen this afternoon, to proceed with the business of  trying
to attract each other. [Interjections.] [Laughter.]

Mrs R R JOEMAT:  Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  reports that a domestic worker is taking  her  employer  to  the
           labour court for unfair dismissal; and


       (b)  that her employer attempted to force her to take an HIV test  if
           she wanted to retain her job;


  (2) believes that this action by this employer is an attack on her  human
       rights and dignity;


  (3) reiterates its position that the decision to go for an HIV test  must
       be made by an individual out of his or her free will and that  he  or
       she has a right to confidentiality;


  (4) condemns this insensitive action by this employer; and


  (5) urges all employers to respect the rights of their employees  and  to
       uphold the right to privacy.

[Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) recognises that political parties arrange  overdraft  facilities  for
       elections;


  (2) notes that the DP's 1999 election debt has been repaid in full ...

[Interjections.] Yes, repaid in full.


  (3) notes that the DA overdraft for the 2000 elections was  mainly  spent
       in the Western Cape to  get  a  majority  of  former  New  NP  people
       elected;


  (4) notes that, unlike the New NP, the DA undertakes to repay every  cent
       of this debt; and
  (5) suggests that the tripartite alliance should beware of inheriting the
       1999 New NP debt of R6,2 million at  federal level and the  R800  000
       it owes in KwaZulu-Natal.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

       Antoneij Rupert.

  That the House -


  (1) notes with great alarm the recent report on  prison  warders  selling
       prison keys to prisoners at Bloemfontein's Grootvlei B Prison;


  (2) believes that these immoral and criminal deeds committed  by  trusted
       members of our society cannot go unpunished;


  (3) commends the prisoners who highlighted this form of corruption in the
       prison; and


  (4) acknowledges that the prisoners' commendable conduct bears  testimony
       to the Department of Correctional Services' rehabilitation programmes
       and positive management.

day of the House I shall move:

  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Auditor-General released a  report  yesterday  on  the
       financial state of the Road Accident Fund;


  (2) expresses its dismay that the fund has actually succeeded once  again
       in slipping further into debt, and is now technically insolvent;
  (3) notes with concern that the accumulated shortfall of the fund  as  at
       April 2000 was an astonishing R10,5 billion;


  (4) condemns the fact that South Africans have to pay high  fuel  prices,
       in order for the Government to throw R2  billion  a  year  into  this
       bottomless pit; and


  (5) calls on the Government to urgently restructure the fuel price and to
       change the basis of operation of  the  fund  in  order  to  eliminate
       exploitation of the fund and the victims.

Mr R P ZONDO: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting

  That the House -


  (1) notes with serious misgiving the continuous distortion of  facts  and
       propagation of half-truths by the ACDP through notices of motion;
  (2) believes that -


       (a)  motions are a vehicle for Members of Parliament and  parties  to
           pronounce on matters of national and  international  importance;
           and;


       (b)  the ACDP has frequently misused the notices of motion to  spread
           its misleading and untrue messages;


  (3) appeals to the ACDP to show respect for the truth; and


  (4) requests members to  respect  the  intellect  of  South  Africans  to
       distinguish fiction from fact, truths from half-truths.

                         UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Chairperson and hon  members,  today  I  present  to
this House the new Unemployment Insurance Bill - and  there  is  no  trouble
because it is not about the death alliance. The finalisation of the  process
of introducing this Bill to the National Assembly marks  a  new  chapter  in
the history of the Unemployment Insurance Fund, as it  attempts  to  address
systemic inefficiencies of the past.

Prior to 1979, the  state  contributed  up  to  50%  of  the  fund's  annual
collections. There are ample records to prove that, during  this  time,  the
fund always had sufficient financial reserves to cover  its  funding  needs.
After 1979, the then government decided  to  legalise  black  trade  unions.
This policy also coincided with the amendment of the Unemployment  Insurance
Act, which reduced the contribution of the state from 50% to  a  maximum  of
R7 million per annum.

The paradox  of  this  decision  was  that  funding  was  reduced,  but  the
obligations  of  the  fund  increased  to  provide  coverage  to  vulnerable
workers. This placed the fund firmly on the  road  to  bankruptcy.  A  brief
historical review  of  the  fund  shows  that  within  five  years  of  this
decision, the fund started to experience financial difficulties.  The  state
responded to calls for assistance during 1984, 1989 and 1994.

The Bill before the House goes to the heart of the current  problems  facing
the fund. It is aimed at ensuring that we achieve a  lasting  resolution  to
the financial woes that have, for a long time, plagued the fund. During  the
period of attempting to resolve the funding crisis, the fund  has  continued
tirelessly to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable  workers  in  our
country. Through various administrative interventions  the  fund  has  never
had occasion to turn away any legitimate claimant. Today,  I  also  presents
the fulfilment of the commitments I made in June 1999, when I  unveiled  the
15-point programme of action to restructure the fund.

Unemployment insurance  is  an  important  policy  area  as  it  contributes
towards the improvement of the social safety net to  mitigate  the  economic
hardships  for  the  unemployed.  The  Bill  pays  particular  attention  to
extending unemployment insurance coverage beyond  current  levels.  This  is
aimed at enhancing the sustainability and  cost-effectiveness  of  the  fund
and creating an environment conducive to improved compliance.

This is to ensure that the fund's  income  is  increased  whilst  low-income
earners are compensated at income levels that are  acceptable  and  able  to
deal with the issue of poverty relief. It is estimated that  these  measures
will bring in an additional income of over R250  million  a  year,  together
with the benefits of better and easy management of wage audits and  earnings
declarations.

The restructuring of the Unemployment Insurance Fund seeks  to  address  the
following shortcomings within  the  current  legislation:  The  limited  and
nonviable nature of coverage, weak enforcement and compliance measures,  the
lack of financial sustainability and the depletion of the  fund's  financial
reserve,  the  rigid  benefit  structure,  discrimination  against   certain
categories of employees,  and  a  lack  of  a  comprehensive  data  base  of
contributors.

In 1996, a three-person task team comprising experts from  labour,  business
and academia was appointed. This task team  was  to  perform  a  situational
analysis  of  the  administration  of  unemployment  insurance,  conduct   a
comparative analysis based on international norms and  make  recommendations
regarding the findings and the financing thereof.

The task team recommended that coverage be  extended  to  all  workers  with
minimum  exclusions,  gender  discrimination  be   removed   by   separating
maternity and unemployment  benefits,  a  progressive  benefit  schedule  be
implemented,  the  existing  types  of  benefits   be   retained,   stricter
enforcement and compliance measures be introduced, a computerised data  base
be introduced, all stakeholders be included in the processes and  structures
of the UIF, and limited executive powers be given to the UIF board.

In November 1998, after several reports were tabled on the financial  status
of the fund, Cabinet approved the release of  the  task  team's  report  for
public  comment.  In  December  1998,  I  released   the   report   on   the
restructuring of the fund. The document was published in the Gazette, and  I
invited  the  public  to  make  relevant  submissions  to  the  Unemployment
Insurance Board.

On 2 February  2000,  Cabinet  approved  two  new  Bills,  the  Unemployment
Insurance Bill and the Unemployed Insurance Contributions Bill.  The  latter
Bill deals with the collection of the unemployment  insurance  contributions
from employers and is intended to consolidate  collections  under  a  single
administration. Sars will be given full responsibility for  collection.  The
Unemployment Insurance Bill will be administered solely  by  the  Department
of  Labour  and  the  Unemployment  Insurance  Fund  will  have  the  single
responsibility for administration and adjudication of claims.

With regard to problems in respect of this fund, this law  will  attempt  to
address a number of  difficulties  currently  being  experienced,  that  is,
litigation procedures currently impose meagre fines on  employers  who  fail
to make their unemployment insurance contributions.  It  is  giving  us  the
power to act against those employers who do not comply with  the  fund.  The
current system  of  contribution  collection  and  payroll  declarations  by
employers is inadequate  and  requires  a  complete  overhaul.  The  use  of
contributors' record  cards  as  the  only  means  of  determining  benefits
payable to contributors' has exposed the fund to  potential  abuse  by  both
employers and employees.
There are key changes that are being made. Within the framework of  the  new
legislation, coverage of workers within the labour market will be  extended.
For the first time  in  the  history  of  unemployment  protection  in  this
country, we will include domestic workers, seasonal workers,  and  employees
earning above the current UIF annual income threshold of R97 188.

Kuyaqala ukuba samkele oomama abasebenza emakhayeni, ukuze nabo  bakhuseleke
phantsi  kwalo  mthetho.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]   Nabasebenzi   bethutyana,   phaya
ezifama, kuyaqala ukuba nabo bakhuseleke. (Translation  of  Xhosa  paragraph
follows.)

[It is the first time that we welcome mothers who work as domestic  workers,
so that they can also be brought under the protection of  this  legislation.
[Applause.] It is also  the  first  time  that  legal  protection  is  being
extended to casual workers on the farms.]

The  inclusion  of  higher  income  groups  as  UIF  contributors  will   be
determined by a maximum income threshold to be determined from time to  time
by the law.

There has been much debate about the inclusion of public servants. I  accept
the report that has been made by the Portfolio Committee on Labour  in  this
regard. I hope that we will be  able  to  do  this  investigation  with  the
Minister for the  Public  Service  and  Administration,  and  submit  it  to
Parliament in due course.

We also introduced a graduated benefits schedule dealing with maternity  and
unemployment benefits because maternity benefits were  first  introduced  by
the UIF in 1954. A female contributor must be paid  benefits  for  maternity
leave, whether or not she is capable of and  available  for  work.  The  UIF
provides 45% of the last wage for a maximum period of six months.

However, drawing maternity benefits means that women workers  therefore  use
up their unemployment benefits. Given that it is obviously  only  women  who
apply for maternity benefits - I have seen no  man  applying  for  maternity
benefits  -  this   provision   therefore   discriminates   against   women.
[Applause.] The new  legislation,  therefore,  proposes  to  eliminate  this
discrimination by separating maternity benefits and unemployment benefits.

Also, regarding strengthening the compliance and  enforcement  measures,  we
are looking at the creation of a contributors data base, dispute  resolution
measures, financial management and actuarial  assessment  of  the  fund  and
entitlement benefits.

I want to conclude by saying that, as members will have  realised  from  the
aforementioned, my department  and  I  are  very  serious  about  addressing
problems facing the unemployed by providing some form  of  safety  net.  The
Bill before the House is the culmination of the joint efforts of  the  staff
of my department, the National Treasury, the Portfolio Committee on  Labour,
and social partners. I wish to extend to them my gratitude on  the  dawn  of
the new Unemployment Insurance Fund.

Indeed, the Portfolio Committee on Labour has worked very  tirelessly,  even
late at night, to make sure that we are  where  we  are  today.  I  want  to
thank, in particular, the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on  Labour.
Even though he is not here today - I believe he is in Saudi Arabia - I  wish
him well. [Applause.]

Mr S A MSHUDULU: Chairperson, hon  members,  distinguished  guests  and  the
nation at large, the ANC as an agent for change supports this Bill.

It is with pride that I stand here to represent the ANC in  this  debate  on
the  Unemployment  Insurance  Bill,  which  is  aimed  at  establishing   an
unemployment insurance fund to which  employers  and  employees  contribute,
and from  which  employees  who  become  unemployed  are  entitled  to  draw
benefits. And, we are doing so to alleviate the harmful economic and  social
effects of unemployment.

Having heard what our Minister has said,  I  wish  to  avoid  repeating  his
words but I would like to highlight specific areas in the Bill. We,  as  the
ANC, note that the Unemployment Insurance Act,  No  30  of  1966,  has  been
amended 20 times, between 1 May 1967 and 1  June  1988,  without  addressing
the social needs of vulnerable workers who are mainly women,  the  disabled,
domestic workers and seasonal workers.

Under the old regime, the  fund  was  nonviable  because  of  its  scope  of
coverage, how  it  was  structured  and  because  it  had  an  inappropriate
administrative  system  based  on  apartheid  policies.  Because   of   this
inefficient administrative system that is also  outdated,  the  fund's  data
could  not  assist  in  its  sustenance  as  information   was,   sometimes,
unreliable. Its structures were not representative of  all  stakeholders  as
represented today in Nedlac for them to be run democratically.

With  poor  data,  it  was  impractical  to  manage,  monitor  and   enforce
compliance of those employers who cheated on the  fund.  What  was  worrying
was that there was no certainty as regards entitlement to benefits. And,  it
was inaccessible because of a lot of bureaucracy. With  all  these  unending
problems, it was necessary that  the  Government  of  the  people  begin  to
fulfil its mandate towards bettering the lives of people,  and  that  is  no
other than the ANC-led Government.

Regarding the content of the  Bill,  to  be  more  specific,  Chapter  1  is
amended to include all employees who work for more than  24  hours  a  month
with a particular employer. It also includes domestic and  seasonal  workers
who work an aggregate period of at  least  three  months  over  a  12  month
[eropd with the same employer and whose work is interrupted by reason  of  a
seasonal variation in the availability of work. To this end, this  Act  will
apply to them and their employers 12 months after  this  Act  takes  effect.
The Minister must, as  soon  as  possible,  after  this  Act  takes  effect,
designate or appoint  a  body  which  must  seek  to  investigate  and  make
recommendations  regarding  the  administration  of  this  Act  to  domestic
workers as well as seasonal workers.

In terms of clause 14 in Chapter  3,  contributors  who  receive  disability
grants can still benefit from the fund.  Clause  18  has  a  provision  that
allows the applicants to determine where they  would  like  to  be  paid  as
opposed to the practice where the claims officer  was  the  one  to  decide.
Clause 35 also provides for mechanisms for benefits  paid  in  error  to  be
recovered or recouped  within  90  days  after  a  written  claim  has  been
forwarded to the ineligible person. Clause 37 provides  that,  should  there
be a dispute, it should be referred to the CCMA  for  arbitration  after  an
appeal has failed through the board.

Chapter 4 provides for enforcement  mechanisms  as  a  measure  to  minimise
problems whereby some employers evade paying for their employees.

Chapter 6 provides for the establishment of an unemployment insurance  board
where  all  Nedlac  stakeholders  shall  nominate  three  members  each   to
represent them on  the  board,  for  example,  organised  labour,  organised
business, the state and the community. Their duties  shall  be  as  provided
for in this Bill, which shall include  advising  the  Minister  as  well  as
making recommendations to him on matters that affect the fund.

Before I conclude in isiXhosa, allow me  to  reflect  on  the  exclusion  of
Public Service employees of provincial and national governments,  which  the
Minister has already mentioned. There was a report which  was  submitted  on
30 October to this House. It  reflects  that  during  the  public  hearings,
concerns were raised about the exclusion of public servants as  set  out  in
clause 3(1)(c) of the Bill. After consultation with the Government  on  this
matter, the majority of committee members agreed that, given the urgency  of
finalising this  draft  legislation,  the  provisions  in  the  Bill  should
remain.

The Commission on Gender Equality raised the concerns about  the  nature  of
maternity coverage as set out in the Bill. The CGE believes  that  this  may
constitute unfair discrimination. It was recommended that,  because  of  the
concerns raised during the public hearings,  the  committee  should  request
the Minister of Labour, in consultation with the Ministers  of  Finance  and
of the Public Service and Administration, to investigate the possibility  of
including public servants as well  as  the  financial  implications  thereof
under  the  Unemployment  Insurance  Fund.  This  investigation  should   be
completed within nine months and  a  report  on  the  outcome  of  the  said
investigation should be presented to the committee.

It was also recommended that the Minister of Labour should, in  consultation
with the Presidency and the CGE,  investigate  the  current  formulation  of
maternity rights, as stated in clause 24, in order to ensure  full  coverage
for the most vulnerable  workers  as  well  as  the  financial  implications
thereof under the Unemployment Insurance Fund. This investigation should  be
completed within nine months  and  a  report  should  be  presented  to  the
committee on the outcome of the said  investigations.  It  must  further  be
noted that the ANC Government has saved the fund from financial crisis.

Makhe, kancinci nje, ndilungiselele  abantwana  bomthonyama,  ndithi  gqaba,
gqaba, phaya naphaya. Nanjengokuba egqibile ukutsho uMhlalingaphambili, ngo-
1996   iqela    leengcungela,    elibandakanya    abasuka    kwezabasebenzi,
oosomashishini  nezifundiswa,  lachongwa  ukuze  lihlalutye   ulawulo   lwe-
Unemployment Insurance Fund, lenze uhlalutyo  oluthelekiseka  nomgangangatho
wamazwe  ngamazwe,  ze  benze   izindululo   ngokubhekisele   ekunikezelweni
kwezimali kubaninizo.

Ezinye zezindululo zabo  zezi:  kufuneka  lubekhona  ukhuseleko  kubo  bonke
abasebenzi   kufuneka   kususwe   ucalu-calulo   ngokobuni;   ze   kwahlulwe
izibonelelo   zabakhulelweyo   kwezo   zokungabikho   phantsi    kwengqesho,
izibonelelo   ezikhoyo    ezisisicwangciso    ngokuphathelele    kumgangatho
mazisetyenziswe;  ezo  zikhoyo  izibonelelelo  kufuneka  zigcinwe;  iindlela
eziqatha zokuqinisekisa  ukuthotyelwa  kufuneka  zaziswe  eluntwini;  abantu
mabaxhotyiswe  ngolwazi  lokugcina  iinkcukacha  ngeekhompuyutha,   kufuneka
bonke  abadlala   indima   ephambili   babandakanywe   kumanqwanqwa   e-UIF,
kananjalo,  amagunya,  angemakhulu,  okuthabatha  izigqibo  anikezelwe  kwi-
Unemployment Insurance Fund.

Ingamampunge,  futhi,  asiyiyo   inyaniso   into   yokuba   i-ANC   ayizange
ibakhathelele abasebenzi. Ngako oko, ndiyabulela  kumzukulwana  kaMdladlana.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[I shall now switch over to my mother tongue, for the sake of its  speakers.
As the chairperson has already mentioned, in 1996 a  group  of  experts  was
set up to evaluate the administration of  the  Unemployment  Insurance  Fund
and this group consisted of  labour  representatives,  business  people  and
academics. Its brief was to do an evaluation that would include  looking  at
comparative  situations  in  other  countries  and   then   come   up   with
recommendations with regard to the payment of beneficiaries.

Among the recommendations made were the  following:  the  interests  of  all
workers should be protected; all forms of discrimination  on  the  basis  of
gender should be eliminated; provision  for  pregnancy  should  be  separate
from provision for unemployment; procedures aimed at  maintaining  standards
should be used; the present procedures should be retained; people should  be
made  aware  of  the  strict  measures  aimed  at  ensuring   adherence   to
procedures; people should be trained  in  storing  data  on  computers;  all
stakeholders should be involved at all levels of the UIF;  and  furthermore,
some decision-making powers, which are not considerable, should be given  to
the Unemployment Insurance Fund.

To suggest that the ANC never cared about the interests of  the  workers  is
not only irresponsible but also untrue. Therefore,  I  am  grateful  to  hon
Minister Mdladlana. [Applause.]]

Mrs B N SONO: Chairperson, the Kliptown manifesto says, and I quote:


  The Government will  look  after  the  most  vulnerable  section  of  the
  population, even members of the civil service will have a right to  state
  help.
This Bill is a piece of legislation that violates even the  basic  tenet  of
the Constitution, which is the Bill of Rights.

The DP believes that an efficient and effective unemployment insurance  fund
is beneficial in a developing economy like  ours.  The  concept  of  a  fund
where contributors are entitled to bridging finances to ease  the  financial
burden between  jobs  makes  economic  sense.  The  provision  of  maternity
benefits for a fixed period associated with childbirth is not only just  and
fair, but it goes a long way towards recognising the importance  of  women's
role in society - something desperately lacking, not only in  South  Africa,
but in many parts of the world today.

Unfortunately, the existing Unemployment Insurance Fund has been plagued  by
abuse and has, consequently, been hit by bankruptcy,   all  of  which  stems
from impracticable systems born of unfeasible legislation. The  commissioner
even attested to this at a committee meeting on the status of women.

Whilst this Bill has  many  strong  points  which  deal  with  many  of  the
shortcomings of the existing UIF, it still falls short of  providing  a  new
streamlined, financially viable and efficient UIF. In its current  form,  it
also faces  at  least  two  potential  constitutional  challenges.  This  is
notably  regarding  the  exclusion  of  civil  servants  and  the  potential
infringement of their rights under section  27(1)(c)  of  the  Constitution,
which the labour portfolio committee has effectively  chosen  to  ignore  in
the legislation before us today.

However, the advantages of this Bill are important  and  worthy  of  sincere
praise. The delinking of maternity rights from unemployment insurance  is  a
step in the right direction. But when we asked  the  commissioner  how  they
were going to go about implementing  this,  no  plans  were  in  place.  The
payment  of  maternity  benefits  marks  a  significant  milestone  in   the
recognition of the role of women in society.  The  debates  surrounding  the
inclusion of domestic  and  seasonal  workers  have  attracted  great  media
interest recently. The DP is conscious  of  the  important  role  that  both
domestic and seasonal workers play in our society and economic wellbeing  as
a country. [Interjections.]

The coverage commences  directly  after  a  12-month  investigation  by  the
department into the logistical  problems  caused  by  their  inclusion.  The
commissioner again attested that he was assigned to do the costing. We  have
a problem. Automatically there is going to be  a  hassle  factor  before  it
gets attested to. The  DP  hopes  that  the  department  will  be  open  and
amenable to new and creative ideas stemming from  the  investigation.  While
the inclusion of both domestic and seasonal  workers  is  important,  it  is
also important not to add to the so-called hassle factor of the economy.

If it becomes practically and bureaucratically difficult to  administer  the
inclusion of domestic and seasonal workers, particularly for  the  employer,
many will either simply ignore  these  provisions  or,  worse  still,  think
twice about hiring again. We again made the commissioner aware of  this  and
he could not come up with a solution. He even admitted  that  there  are  no
women on that very commission. So at the end  of  the  day,  we  should,  as
women sitting here, put our money where our mouth is. [Interjections.]

With regard to financial controls, the state will recover  any  deficits  in
the  fund  and  all  expenditure  will  obviously  have  to  be  within  the
permissible framework  of  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act.  The  Bill
provides  for  adequate  financial  controls  in  most  areas.   Application
procedures have been streamlined and made more user  friendly.  The  serious
potential problems with this legislation are within the application  of  the
new Act and unfortunately, in the  opinion  of  the  DP,  render  this  Bill
impossible to support. [Interjections.]

The decision to exclude public servants from the fund must surely be one  of
the most significant problems with this piece  of  legislation.  At  Nedlac,
their inclusion was agreed to by  both  business  and  labour.  Their  final
exclusion is  entirely  due  to  the  intervention  of  Government  and  the
department. The department was unable to produce a  reasonable  argument  to
sustain their point of view and traded entirely on the presumption that  the
Public Service is a stable means of employment. The nation  can  be  assured
that the DP will  always  be  there  to  execute  its  duty  to  the  point.
[Interjections.]

At no stage was the committee presented with  reasoning  as  to  why  public
servants would not need the sort of coverage envisaged in the UIF Bill.  The
DP supports the notion  of  an  effective  and  efficient  UIF.  While  this
legislation has made great strides in that  direction,  the  fatal  flaws  I
have outlined today unfortunately make it impossible for us to support  this
Bill. The inclusion of all ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Chairperson, Ministers and hon  members,  South  Africa  is
entering into a glowing new era in so far as this Bill  is  concerned.  This
Bill comes at a period  engulfed  by  very  harsh  economic  realities.  The
majority of people are unemployed and more are losing  their  jobs.  Such  a
predicament has severe consequences for the state,  as  evidenced  by  crime
and other violent acts, especially on pensioners harassed by their  children
and grandchildren.

The  IFP  welcomes  the  fact  that  in  conjunction  with  the  receipt  of
unemployment benefits, applicants or workers will also be afforded a  chance
to undergo training and vocational counselling for employment. Skills are  a
very important resource when looking for employment. Employers  need  people
with skills and they do not consider the fact  that  we  come  from  a  very
repressive era where it was not even possible to acquire those skills.

As regards the application to receive benefits, we wish  to  put  on  record
that some applicants fail to receive their  benefits  when  their  employer,
who, in many cases, goes underground or even  abroad,  is  liquidated.  Such
employees are not issued with their blue cards. When they go to  the  labour
offices, they are required to produce these blue cards and have no  recourse
to justice in the circumstances as they are not properly guided as  to  what
they should do.
Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Some people get yellow cards!

Prince N E ZULU: Yebo. [Yes.] One should  really  believe  that  the  proper
course to follow would be to look for the liquidator or  master  responsible
for such liquidation. Another alternative would be  to  go  the  SA  Revenue
Service' offices if that applicant was a registered taxpayer, so  that  they
can give an indication as to what has happened to  the  employer.  But  this
process can be very tiring and expensive for an unemployed person. Some,  if
not most of them, will not even know of this route.

The IFP also welcomes the entrenched right to illness benefits when  an  ill
person is not at work. In the course of this illness, she or he -  I  better
say ``he or she'' - may not receive any benefit from his or her  job  beyond
the 14-day period.

The IFP welcomes the inclusion of  domestic  and  seasonal  workers  in  the
Unemployment  Insurance  Fund.  These  are  the  employees  who   are   very
vulnerable to unemployment, as they cannot be easily absorbed by the  labour
market. Providing something to fall back  on  in  times  of  distress,  will
surely be a very noble effort.

However, we are concerned that public servants are not yet included in  this
Bill, whereas they are also employees. We would like to  see  them  included
in the provisions as employees. The fact that they have other benefits  does
not tally with the argument that they should not be included in  this  Bill.
At this point, members could point a finger at me and see me  as  a  typical
and living victim of the absence of  such  a  clause  in  the  previous  and
current  dispensation.  Therefore,  this  situation  cannot  be  allowed  to
continue indefinitely.

What is wrong with the enhancement of their benefits if  we  are  determined
to deal with the brain drain from the Public  Service?  The  private  sector
siphons numerous skills from the Public Service because, in  comparison,  it
pays better. The extension of these benefits can  summarily  and  ultimately
serve to deter this exodus. The IFP supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Ms H F MALEBANA: Chairperson, the advent of  democracy  brought  about  hope
for a better life to the  previously  disadvantaged  and  marginalised.  The
Bill is about  the  acceleration  of  service  delivery  to  the  sick,  the
unemployed, the poor and the hungry. It is about ensuring  that  the  social
security net covers the majority of the people.

Considerable strides have been taken with this Bill. As far as domestic  and
seasonal workers are concerned, it is the first time in the history  of  our
country that they are  commended  as  workers.  Their  contribution  to  the
economy is being acknowledged. This is  a  major  victory  for  the  ANC-led
Government and the workers as a whole. The hon the Minister of  Labour  must
provide regulations, within a period of 12 months from the  commencement  of
this Act, on  mechanisms  regarding  the  administration  of  this  Bill  to
domestic and seasonal workers.

The calculation date for the unemployment benefit application  will  be  the
date from which the contributor is unemployed. To qualify,  the  contributor
must register as a workseeker at  a  labour  centre  and  be  available  for
justifiable work. The contributor will not receive benefits  if  she  or  he
does not report at the stipulated dates and times or if she  or  he  refuses
to undergo training without just reason. But if the contributor becomes  ill
while collecting unemployment benefits, she or he will  remain  entitled  to
continue receiving the benefit.

Regarding illness, the illness  period  is  determined  from  the  date  the
employee is unable to perform duty owing to illness or is receiving  50%  of
the normal salary owing to illness. If the contributor fails to  perform  or
fulfil any prescribed requirements, then she or  he  cannot  apply  for  the
benefit. If the contributor has exhausted all illness  benefits  or  refuses
to undergo medical treatment without just reason, she or he is not  entitled
to receive the benefit.

Concerning the adoption  benefits,  the  application  is  submitted  by  one
contributor of the adopting parents or partners. The  child  must  be  under
two years of age. The adoption will be granted by an order of court  as  per
the requirement of the Child Care Act of 1983. The  contributor  must  spend
the period not working but caring for the child.

In the case of dependant's benefits, the deceased  contributor's  spouse  or
partner is entitled to the benefits if the application is  submitted  within
six months and is in accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Act.  The
deceased contributor's child can  also  apply  for  the  benefit  after  six
months, if there is no application submitted by the spouse or  life  partner
of the deceased contributor.

As far as public servants are concerned we as the ANC, have proved  that  we
love them as well as all the other workers of this country. As  the  ANC-led
Government, what we are saying is that we need to have the  public  servants
also included in this Bill, but we could  not  do  so,  owing  to  technical
complications. The  hon  the  Minister  of  Labour  must  investigate  their
inclusion and the financial implications  thereof,  nine  months  after  the
promulgation of the Act, which, of course, is a reasonable time frame.

I now come to maternity benefits. Previously most  women  were  punished  or
penalised for being mothers. They were  either  dismissed  or  did  not  get
their salaries when going on maternity leave. Women workers waged  a  battle
to ensure that maternity benefits are recognised as  rights  and  also  that
maternity benefits are delinked from unemployment benefits. That  guarantees
that as contributors women's unemployment benefits  are  not  affected  when
they go on maternity leave.

It must be borne in mind that during maternity leave life becomes  difficult
and complicated for the family. It is the responsibility of  all  of  us  as
South Africans, as a country  that  encourages  mothers  to  breastfeed,  to
ensure that the new addition to the family  becomes  a  bundle  of  joy  and
happiness. Failure to do so always leads to women abandoning  their  newborn
babies to rush back to work so  that  they  can  start  earning  their  full
salaries.
Ke nako ya gore re thome hlokomela batswetši ba rena. Ba nyaka  tšhelete  ya
go ba apeša le go hlokomela gore masea a bona a hwetša  kalafo  ka  nako  ya
maswanedi. [It is high time that we cared for our nursing mothers  who  need
some money to purchase appropriate clothing and a  healthy  diet  for  their
newborn babies.]

Sixty per cent of the normal salary for four months is a step in  the  right
direction. We are saying that 100% will ensure that our nursing  mothers  do
not run back to work immediately after childbirth, but that they  and  their
families enjoy the arrival of the new addition.

Bjale ka naga yeo e ratago go bona re eba le masea  ao  a  thabilego,  ao  a
phedilego gabotse, re swanetše go  fihlela  le  go  phethagatša  takatso  ya
bomma bao ba amušago masea ka go ba fa megolo ya bona  ka  moka  ge  ba  eya
setswetši. Ka Sepedi re re: Lesea ka gae ke makhura. A re  le  amogeleng  ka
diatla tše pedi. Ke a leboga. (Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[As a country that is totally committed to promoting health  care,  we  need
to accommodate the needs of those women who  choose  to  breast  feed  their
babies by paying them full monthly salaries as well as  benefits  when  they
go on maternity leave.  My  Sepedi  culture  recognises  newborn  babies  as
symbols of joy and happiness. So, we need to embrace  those  gifts  in  that
spirit.]

Mr A BLAAS: Chairperson, the  Bill  we  are  dealing  with  today  is  of  a
technical nature and addresses weaknesses in the  current  legislation  that
provides the safety net for those who have become unemployed. The fact  that
we are dealing with a Bill like this, in addition to the  current  financial
state of the Unemployment Insurance Fund,  is  a  clear  indication  of  the
seriousness of the unemployment problem in South Africa. It  is  my  sincere
hope that in future we will  be  able  to  see  contributions  to  the  fund
increase, while payment to those who become unemployed falls, as we  succeed
in addressing the problem of unemployment in South Africa.

Unemployment is a national crisis. We dare  not  play  petty  politics  with
this issue. The issue of unemployment can only be solved if we lift  it  out
of the political arena and find ways of working together,  despite  whatever
our political differences might be. This is also one of the key reasons  the
NNP believes that a return  to  a  more  inclusive  model  will  be  in  the
interests of everybody. We have a responsibility towards the youth of  South
Africa to see to it that the building blocks of  a  prosperous  and  growing
economy are in place.

Die  Nuwe  NP  ondersteun  die  wenslikheid  van  die   wet   sonder   enige
voorbehoude.   Die   meeste   van   die    hervormingsmaatreëls    in    die
wysigingswetsontwerp is verbeterings op  die  ou  wet  en  kan,  indien  die
administrasie doeltreffend en nougeset gedoen word, baie van  die  bestaande
probleme ondervang.

Kommer  bestaan  egter  steeds  oor  die  finansiële  lewensvatbaarheid   en
outonomie van die fonds. Die uitsluiting van 'n groot en  belangrike  sektor
van die deelnemers uit die fonds en die gebrek  aan  aktuariële  berekeninge
laat vrae ontstaan of die bogenoemde maatreëls wel die fonds in  staat  gaan
stel om sy verpligtinge na te kom.

Die grondliggende beginsel waarop die fonds as versekering vir  werkloosheid
gebou is, berus op 'n beginsel van groepsdeelname.  Klousule  3(1)(c)  sluit
egter die werknemers en werkgewers in die  nasionale  en  provinsiale  sfeer
van regering uit. Die uitsluiting is  teenstrydig  met  alle  getuienis  wat
deur die portefeuljekomitee aangehoor is.

Dit is 'n beduidende groot uitsluiting en dus teenstrydig met  die  beginsel
van minimumuitsluiting. Dit ontneem werknemers in die  sektor  ook  van  die
voordele van die fonds. Die komitee beveel gevolglik aan dat die  insluiting
van dié sektor weer oorweeg moet word.

Indien die regering egter erns hiermee gehad het, kon hy in die  wetsontwerp
dieselfde voorsiening vir  dié  sektor  gemaak  het  as  vir  die  huis-  en
seisoenwerkers. Hierdie optrede is inkonsekwent en  diskriminerend.  Om  dié
rede kan die Nuwe NP nie die wetsontwerp steun nie.

Die wetsontwerp is 'n verbetering op die bestaande wet. Die uitsluiting  van
die openbare sektor ontneem egter die fonds van 'n beduidende inkomste.  Dit
ontneem ook 'n beduidende groep werknemers van die voordele van  die  fonds.
Die wetsontwerp as sodanig gaan  egter  nie  die  probleme  oplos  nie.  Die
bestaande skuld moet goedgemaak word. Dit is verblydend om te sien  dat  die
aanvullende begroting hiervoor voorsiening maak.

'n Vasberade wil om die fonds suksesvol te administreer en  te  bestuur,  is
noodsaaklik. Geleenthede moet deur konstruktiewe samewerking  en  oplossings
geskep word wat veral werkloosheid onder die jeug aanpak. Dit  sal  die  las
op      die      maatskaplike      veiligheidsnetwerke,       soos       die
Werkloosheidsversekeringsfonds, aansienlik verlig.

Die Nuwe NP kan ongelukkig, om die redes soos genoem,  nie  die  wetsontwerp
steun nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The New NP supports the desirability of the Act without  any  reservations.
Most of the reform measures in the amending Bill  are  improvements  on  the
old Act and can, if  the  administration  is  carried  out  efficiently  and
meticulously, obviate many of the existing problems.

However, concern still exist regarding the financial viability and  autonomy
of the fund. The exclusion of a large and important sector  of  participants
from the fund and the lack of actuarial calculations give rise to  questions
as to whether the aforementioned measures will indeed  enable  the  fund  to
meet its obligations.

The fundamental principle on which  the  fund  is  built  as  insurance  for
unemployment,  rests  on  the  principle  of  group  participation.   Clause
3(1)(c), however, excludes the employers and employees in the  national  and
provincial spheres of government. The exclusion  is  in  contradiction  with
all evidence heard by the portfolio committee.

This is a significantly  large  exclusion  and  therefore  contrary  to  the
principle of minimum exclusion. It also deprives employees in the sector  of
the benefits of the  fund.  The  committee  therefore  recommends  that  the
inclusion of this sector be reconsidered.

However, if the Government had been serious about this matter it could  have
made the same provision in the Bill for this sector as for the domestic  and
seasonal workers. This action is inconsistent and discriminatory.  For  this
reason the New NP cannot support the Bill.

The Bill is an improvement on the existing Act. However,  the  exclusion  of
the public  sector  deprives  the  fund  of  significant  revenue.  It  also
deprives a significant group of employees  of  the  benefits  of  the  fund.
However, the Bill as such is not going to solve the problems.  The  existing
debt must be paid back. It is  heartening  to  see  that  the  supplementary
estimate makes provision for this.

Determination to administer and manage the fund successfully  is  essential.
Opportunities must be  created  by  way  of  constructive  co-operation  and
solutions which tackle unemployment among  the  youth  in  particular.  This
will significantly lighten the burden on the social security networks,  such
as the Unemployment Insurance Fund.

For the reasons mentioned above, the New NP can  unfortunately  not  support
the Bill.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Mr Chairperson, the UDM  will  support  this  Bill.  As  we
know, great minds debate or discuss issues, average minds debate or  discuss
events, and small minds debate or  discuss  people.  We  are  not  going  to
discuss people in this  Bill.  We  are  going  to  discuss  the  merits  and
demerits of the Bill.

I want to associate myself with the report of  our  Portfolio  Committee  on
Labour on the Unemployment Insurance Bill, which has already been  presented
to this  National  Assembly  for  consideration.  Our  committee  heard  and
considered evidence and submissions made by various stakeholders during  the
public hearings. To name but a few, there was  Business  South  Africa,  the
Centre for International and Comparative Labour  and  Social  Security  Law,
the Commission for Gender  Equality,  Disabled  People  of  SA,  Cosatu  and
several others. This is an issue. We are not talking about people here.

The commitment of the portfolio committee and  the  department  to  continue
working and co-operating  with  the  stakeholders  in  dealing  with  labour
matters need, therefore, not be reiterated or emphasised. The commitment  of
the  committee  to  ensure  that   this   Parliament   remains   accessible,
transparent and accountable cannot be questioned, in particular, in  as  far
as this Bill is concerned.

The UDM was, however, concerned about the exclusion of public  servants,  as
set out in section 3(1)(c) of the Bill, and about a percentage of  maternity
benefits which,  according  to  the  Commission  for  Gender  Equality,  may
constitute unfair discrimination. We are grateful that,  this  morning,  the
hon Minister came up and responded positively to these concerns.

Our committee agreed that because of these concerns, which  we  also  raised
during the public hearings, the Ministers of Labour and of Finance  and  the
Minister for the  Public  Service  and  Administration  should  investigate,
expeditiously, the inclusion of public servants,  taking  into  account  the
financial implications thereof, under the Unemployment Insurance  Fund.  The
committee  also  agreed  that  the  Department  of  Labour  should   further
investigate the concerns about the maternity benefits  and  report  back  on
the  matter  in  the  near  future.  The  Minister  has,  again,   responded
positively to this concern.

All the political parties represented on the  committee  agreed  unanimously
that the legislation should be passed by Parliament, and  the  UDM  supports
the Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairperson, we can make as much noise as we  want  to
on unemployment. We can debate as many Bills as we want to  on  unemployment
in this House, but the fact of the matter is that as long as the  Government
of the day does not create jobs in South Africa,  the  financial  burden  of
unemployment will cost South Africa dearly.

Dit is die waarheid, Meneer die Voorsitter. Die agb Minister van Arbeid  sal
met sy kollega moet praat en sal moet  verseker  dat  die  omstandighede  in
Suid-Afrika gunstig raak vir beleggings om sodoende werk te  skep.  As  daar
werk is, dan is die werkloosheidsprobleem  'n  baie  kleiner  een.  Die  agb
Minister van Arbeid en sy kollegas sal moet sorg dat die  veiligheidsituasie
in Suid-Afrika verbeter. Die agb Minister van Arbeid moet verseker  dat  die
arbeidswette in Suid-Afrika van so 'n  aard  is,  dat  dit  gunstig  is  vir
oorsese beleggers en vir besigheidsmense om  behoorlik  besigheid  in  Suid-
Afrika te kan kom doen. Die sukses van hierdie wetsontwerp gaan  afhang  van
die effektiewe administrasie.

Dit is algemeen bekend  dat  daar  baie  probleme  is  as  dit  kom  by  die
werkloosheidsversekeringsfonds.  Daar  is  mense  wat  by   twee   of   drie
verskillende plekke werkloosheidsversekering gaan eis en  in  die  tou  gaan
staan. Dit bring 'n verdere finansiële  las  op  die  belastingbetalers  van
Suid-Afrika. Daarom sê die VF: Voordat die behoorlike administrasie om  100%
te kan verseker dat daar nie  korrupsie  kan  plaasvind  nie,  kan  ons  nie
hierdie  wetsontwerp  ondersteun  nie.  Die  VF  kan  net  die   wetsontwerp
ondersteun indien die regering van die dag sorg vir gunstiger  omstandighede
om  werksgeleenthede  te  kan  skep.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[This is the truth, Mr Chairperson. The hon  the  Minister  of  Labour  will
have to talk to his colleague and will have to ensure  that  the  conditions
in South Africa become favourable for investments in order to  create  work.
If there was work then the unemployment problem  would  be  a  much  smaller
one. The hon the Minister of Labour and his colleagues will have  to  ensure
that the security situation in South Africa improves. The hon  the  Minister
of Labour has to ensure that the labour laws in South Africa are of  such  a
nature that they are favourable  for  foreign  investors  and  for  business
people to be able to do business properly in South Africa.  The  success  of
this Bill will depend on its effective administration.

It is common knowledge that there are many problems when  it  comes  to  the
unemployment insurance fund. There are people who  queue  at  two  or  three
different places to claim unemployment  insurance.  This  places  a  further
financial burden on the taxpayers of South Africa. For this  reason  the  FF
says: Until there is  proper  administration  to  make  100%  sure  that  no
corruption takes place we cannot support this Bill. The FF can only  support
this Bill if  the  government  of  the  day  ensures  that  there  are  more
favourable conditions to create job opportunities.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, the hon member must be deaf.

It is noted that the contributions to the formulation of this Bill began  as
early as 1996. The findings  of  the  task  team  appear  to  put  in  place
provisions to institute an efficient Unemployment Insurance Bill.

Having viewed the provisions, everything appears adequate. However, in  view
of the graduated benefit schedule,  it  is  felt,  although  this  has  been
agreed to, a higher contribution should be  considered.  The  provision  the
Bill makes to delink maternity and unemployment benefits is  supported,  and
it is felt that without this differentiation, it  would  certainly  infringe
upon the rights of and discriminate against women.

The  strengthening  of  compliance  and  enforcement  measures   serves   to
seriously address the issues of noncompliance of employers.  The  fines  and
penalties  should  certainly  serve  the  purpose.   The   creation   of   a
contributions data base certainly appears to  be  an  administrative  asset.
However, a backup system and safety precautions, as to the privacy  of  this
documentation, are important and security to ensure this must be stressed.

Furthermore, the  dispute  resolution  measures,  financial  management  and
actuarial assessment serve their purpose  well.  The  department  is  to  be
applauded. It is certain that the Bill sets out a  good  framework  for  the
Unemployment Insurance Fund and if instituted adequately, it will  certainly
attain its envisaged objectives.

The MF supports the Unemployment Insurance Bill. [Applause.]

Mr G G OLIPHANT: Mr Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  comrades  and  colleagues,
what pains me today is that we  have  members  of  the  opposition  parties,
particularly the DP and the FF, coming to misrepresent the facts  about  the
Bill here today.

It is clear that members do not attend portfolio committees, and  when  they
come here, they just talk about what they  think.  Actually,  when  the  hon
member from the DP started to quote from the Kliptown manifesto,  I  thought
that at least she had read the Freedom Charter, but when  she  went  on,  it
was clear that she was just quoting something else.
The issues that  she  raised  were  issues  that  we  have  debated  in  the
committee and, clearly, she has misrepresented the facts. The DP is doing  a
disservice to its members. They must, please, ensure  that  they  give  them
the facts before they deploy them to this platform. [Interjections.]

The Unemployment Insurance  Bill  before  Parliament  today  reconfirms  the
continued commitment of the ANC to service delivery, and the  protection  of
the poor and the vulnerable. The  Bill  represents  the  final  leg  of  our
labour law reform process, which started in 1994.

The ANC Government has done exceptionally well, in the past seven years,  to
transform the labour market from what it was under the  old  apartheid  rule
to the new dispensation. The restructuring,  today,  of  the  UIF  forms  an
important part of the five-year programme of action which  was  launched  by
the Department of Labour in 1995 to pursue the goals of  the  RDP.  The  RDP
calls for new measures to extend  human  rights,  strengthen  democracy  and
promote economic growth.
The evidence of our legislative record is next to  none  in  the  developing
countries and still compares favourably with developed  economies.  For  the
record,  since  1994  we  have  enacted  the  integration  of  labour  laws,
disestablished  the  then  Department  of  Manpower  -  commonly  known   as
``Mannekrag'' - and formed the Department of Labour. We have also until  now
passed the Nedlac Act, Labour Relations Act, Basic Conditions of  Employment
Act,  Employment  Equity  Act,  Skills  Development  Act  and   the   Skills
Development Levies Act. This is an impressive record, which has  contributed
meaningfully to shaping our economy today.

This Bill enables workers who  become  unemployed  or  their  dependants  to
claim benefits from the fund,  including  maternity,  illness  and  adoption
benefits. It also represents yet another milestone in the implementation  of
our constitutional mandate to provide for appropriate social  protection  of
those in need.

The Bill gives renewed hope to domestic and seasonal workers who  will  also
be entitled to claim benefits  from  the  fund  after  certain  transitional
investigations have been concluded. This provision also  applies  to  public
servants in the provincial and  national  spheres  of  Government  who  were
historically not covered by the Unemployment Insurance Fund.

With regard to domestic workers, the investigation for their  inclusion  has
gone on for almost 10 years since the  Limbrick  Commission  which,  amongst
others, investigated workable methods  of  collecting  their  contributions.
Whilst we accept that this is a complex and difficult  matter  and  that  it
will not be easy for lawmakers to resolve, we also accept that  it  is  even
worse for domestic workers who become  expectant  and  unemployed,  with  no
social  security  benefits,  to  mitigate  their  economic   hardship.   The
portfolio committee undertakes to to give the Minister  and  the  Department
of Labour all the support they would need to resolve this matter.

We also take this opportunity to welcome the adjustments  estimate  of  R605
million for social insurance as announced by  the  Minister  of  Finance  on
Tuesday. This will bring the necessary relief to the Unemployment  Insurance
Fund and put it in a better position to meet its obligations.  Through  this
law, we also seek to strengthen the administrative capacity of the  fund  in
order to deal with problems of noncompliance by  employers,  nonpayment  and
the sometimes deliberate misrepresentation of  employee  earnings.  The  new
system will enable claimants to be prequalified  for  benefits  even  before
reporting  to  the  Unemployment  Insurance  Fund  offices,  which   further
enhances the capacity of the fund to deal with employer-employee fraud.

The ANC is quite satisfied with this legislation  and  urges  Parliament  to
support  it.  Indeed,  this  is   a   product   of   extensive   stakeholder
participation at Nedlac, which was further assisted by  the  involvement  of
the  ILO  department  of  social  security.  The  portfolio  committee  also
conducted public hearings on this Bill during March  2001  as  part  of  our
commitment to accountability, transparency and accessibility to  Parliament.
All 15 organisations that participated  contributed  a  great  deal  towards
improving this law and we appreciate their effort.

In conclusion, I wish to  report  that  the  portfolio  committee  has  also
finalised its work of dealing with amendments to the  Labour  Relations  Act
and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act. We  are  ready  to  debate  this
piece of legislation in Parliament before we go on recess or, if  needs  be,
to come back even more ready next year to  conclude  this  matter.  The  ANC
supports the Unemployment Insurance Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER  OF  LABOUR:  Mr  Chairperson,  I  want  to  thank  the  acting
chairperson of the portfolio committee. Someone  was  calling  him  a  small
elephant. I suppose there are two elephants in Parliament: there is the  big
one and a small one.

I want to thank hon  members  for  supporting  our  department  because  any
labour legislation that we introduce is not an easy  process.  Members  will
remember that I made this announcement in the year 2000, but it went  on  up
to 2001. The debates were very vibrant and, of  course,  had  tensions  -  I
remember domestics even chaining themselves  to  the  gates  of  Parliament.
That shows members how dynamic and vibrant our labour market is.

It is, of course, very easy for other members to come  and  lament  at  this
podium because of not understanding the dynamics within the  labour  market.
If one is not careful, if one does not create this balance, one  can  easily
cause havoc, anarchy and chaos in this country. The ANC is not  an  anarchic
organisation. We do not want chaos  in  this  country.  We  do  not  want  a
situation in this country where there is no President  in  the  country  and
key positions do not have people manning them, like in the Western Cape.

Unfortunately, I do not think that the hon member Ms B  N  Sono  understands
the difficulties in relation, for instance, to public servants. It is not  a
simple matter. Because  one  will  effectively  be  deducting  1%  from  the
salaries of public servants, one needs to consult extensively  before  doing
that. Having been a teacher for many years, one cannot just take  1%  of  my
salary without a challenge from me. So we have to be sure  of  what  we  are
doing, because there is no union leader who has  guaranteed  me  that  there
will be no reaction. We have seen reactions before, and I do not want  those
reactions to happen now.

Therefore, I agree with the decision of  the  portfolio  committee  on  this
matter. I think it  is  a  very  responsible  decision  that  the  portfolio
committee has taken. I, therefore, commend them and  thank  them  very  much
for taking such a decision in this regard, and  for  not  following  the  DP
line. That is why that party is joining  the  ``Death  Alliances''  all  the
time. [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Death Alliance?

The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Yes, Death Alliances like yours.

I also want to say that one of the reasons we wanted to include  the  public
servants was precisely because we, firstly, wanted the fund  to  be  viable.
However, at the time of the negotiations at Nedlac we  were  still  rambling
with our  own  Treasury  committee  in  relation  to  the  guaranteeing  and
underwriting of the fund. We have now resolved  those  problems.  The  state
guarantees the fund.

Secondly, there is  now  an  agreement  that  will  deal  with  the  current
problems of the fund, hence the R605 million  which  was  announced  by  the
Minister of Finance in this regard. The fund is, for the first time,  having
serious financial difficulties because past governments had been  giving  us
R7 million per year. We now have R605 million to  assist  the  fund  and  we
should be saying hallelujah.

The issue of domestics is also not a very simple matter -  the  hon  members
have domestic workers. Some members here were even opposed to  what  we  are
currently proposing in relation to the determination to their  wages.  I  do
not want to mention those who were opposed to that.  Members  must  remember
that the domestics are earning meagre wages as well and,  for  the  UIF,  we
will have to deduct 1% from the R100 that they are  earning  per  month.  So
there are many other issues that I need to  resolve.  One  of  them  is  the
support of this House on the minimum wage  that  we  are  proposing,  so  we
should stop dancing and dilly-dallying on these matters.

I really want to thank hon members.

Re a leboga, Ntate Ramodike. [Thank you, hon member Ramodike.]

I was not sure about where  the  New  NP  stands  because  there  were  some
contradictions in what Mr Blaas was saying. But I do not want  to  blast  Mr
Blaas because I want him to be a member of the ANC pretty soon!  [Applause.]

                WELCOMING OF MILLENNIUM SENIOR CITIZENS CLUB

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Before we proceed to  the  next
Order of the day, I would like to recognise in the gallery  the  members  of
the Millennium Senior Citizens Club of Durban, who are  visiting  Cape  Town
and our Parliament. [Applause.]

        CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND
        CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON JUDICIAL MATTERS AMENDMENT BILL

Order disposed without debate.

Report adopted.

                       JUDICIAL MATTERS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Could  I  please  solicit  the
support of the Whips. Hon members of the New NP, could we please  have  some
decorum in the House?

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, it  is
a well known practice to encompass in  a  single  Bill,  in  this  case  the
Judicial Matters Amendment Bill,  a  variety  of  amendments  which  do  not
require individual amendments. This is the case with the  Bill  before  this
House this  morning.  The  amendments  contained  in  the  Judicial  Matters
Amendment Bill to a large extent correct deficiencies in certain  provisions
and repeal certain redundant provisions.

I do not intend to explain these technical amendments to  the  House  today.
However, it often happens that proposed amendments of a  more  comprehensive
and substantial nature are included in an amending Bill of this nature ...

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  it  is  not
permissible to be conducting business in the aisles,  as  some  hon  members
are doing. I am sorry to interrupt the debate. Hon Prof Mohamed and all  hon
members who are in the aisles should either take their seats  or  leave  the
Chamber quietly  so  that  the  business  of  the  House  can  proceed.  Hon
Minister, you may continue. We will give you injury time.

The MINISTER: Chairperson, thanks for that kindness.

I want particularly to refer to clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill. However,  allow
me to provide the House with some background information before  I  turn  to
the content of the relevant clauses.

Section 81 of the Correctional Services  Act  of  1998  deals  with  special
measures for the  reduction  of  the  prison  population.  Statistical  data
provided by the  Department  of  Correctional  Services  indicates  that  an
unacceptably high percentage of the total prison  population  on  a  monthly
basis consists of unsentenced prisoners.

Since the ambit of section 81 of the Correctional Services Act  of  1998  is
limited  to  sentenced  prisoners,  and  in  an  attempt  to   address   the
overcrowding in our prisons, a provision was included  in  the  Correctional
Services Amendment Bill by way of an amendment which aimed  to  establish  a
mechanism for the release of unsentenced prisoners.
The Correctional Services Amendment Bill was passed by this House on 11  May
this  year  and  referred  to  the  National  Council   of   Provinces   for
concurrence. Certain objections were  raised  in  respect  of  the  relevant
proposed provision while  the  Bill  was  being  considered  by  the  Select
Committee on Security and Constitutional  Development.  The  chairperson  of
the committee decided to invite comments on the Bill. After considering  the
comments  received,  a  further  amendment  was  effected  to  the  proposed
provision of the Bill and  the  Bill  was  referred  back  to  the  National
Assembly.

However, a decision was taken to reject the relevant clause in favour  of  a
more comprehensive amendment to the Criminal Procedure  Act  of  1977.  This
decision was based on the fact that a mechanism of this nature  should  form
part of  the  bail  provisions  contained  in  Chapter  9  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Act of 1977, and that provision ought to be made for the  head  of
prison to apply to the magistrate's court in  question  to  reconsider  bail
conditions in individual cases.

It was also felt that applications of this nature should  be  restricted  to
persons who remain in custody in respect of certain less  serious  offences.
Any magistrate of the magistrate's court in question may  consider  such  an
application.

This brings me to clauses 6 and 7 of the  Judicial  Matters  Amendment  Bill
before the House, which were formulated  after  a  process  of  consultation
with  the  Department  of  Correctional  Services  and  the  Office  of  the
inspecting judge for prisons, who  were  in  favour  of  and  supported  the
proposed provisions.

Clause 6 of the Bill, therefore, aims to amend Chapter  9  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Act of 1977  by  inserting  a  new  section  63A  into  that  Act.
Provision is made for the release of accused persons  or  the  amendment  of
the bail conditions of accused persons who are  charged  with  certain  less
serious offences; who have been granted bail by any lower court  in  respect
of the  relevant  offences  but  are  unable  to  pay  the  amount  of  bail
concerned, and who are in detention only in  respect  of  the  less  serious
offences concerned.
Clause 6 further provides that an application of this nature may be  brought
by a head of prison on account  of  prison  conditions  which  constitute  a
material and imminent threat  to  the  human  dignity,  physical  health  or
safety of the accused person in question.  An  application  of  this  nature
will also  only  be  successful  if  the  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions
concerned, or a prosecutor authorised thereto by him or her in writing,  has
indicated that the prosecuting authority does not  oppose  the  application.
Clause 7, in short, aims to amend section 64 of the Criminal  Procedure  Act
of 1977 so as to ensure that the proceedings contemplated in  clause  6  are
recorded in full.

I conclude by saying that the proper application  of  a  mechanism  of  this
nature  will,  to  a  large  extent,  contribute  to  a  position  where  an
acceptable norm for the prison may be maintained with relative ease. I  want
to thank the portfolio committee, particularly Adv  Johnnie  de  Lange,  for
their co-operation and for the manner in which they dealt  with  this  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr M T MASUTHA: Chairperson, hon members and the House,  when  this  country
adopted its Constitution in 1996, it made certain promises  to  its  people,
which it now has the duty to fulfil. One of these promises is  contained  in
section 1(a) under  the  Founding  Provisions  of  the  Constitution,  which
states, and I quote:  The  Republic  of  South  Africa  is  one,  sovereign,
democratic state founded on the following values:


  Human dignity, the achievement of equality and the advancement  of  human
  rights and freedoms.


  The notion of equality is further elaborated upon under section  9(2)  of
  the Constitution, which states and I quote:


  Equality includes  the  full  and  equal  enjoyment  of  all  rights  and
  freedoms.

The Bill before us today, the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill,  2001,  is  a
small, yet significant contribution towards the fulfilment of this  promise.
I am in particular referring to clause 6 of the  Bill,  which  introduces  a
new section into the Criminal Procedure Act of 1977, namely  section  63(A).
This new section empowers a head of a prison to apply  to  the  court  which
has granted bail to an accused who is unable to pay the amount of  the  bail
for the release of the accused in  lieu  of  bail,  or  to  amend  the  bail
conditions imposed on the accused by that  court.  This  could  include  the
reduction of the amount of bail granted to the accused by that court.

The proposal to include  such  a  major  amendment  under  the  Correctional
Services Amendment Bill, 2001, was, correctly so, deemed by  this  House  to
be inappropriate when it rejected  that  Bill  earlier  this  year.  As  the
detained persons concerned in this regard are  not  convicted  persons,  but
awaiting-trial accused persons whose cases are  still  pending  finalisation
by a court, by way of  a  criminal  trial.  Moreover,  it  would  have  been
inappropriate, as was proposed in that Bill, not  to  refer  the  review  of
bail granted to the detained accused person back to the court which  granted
such bail.
Further, the Bill is intended  to  ensure  that  this  measure  is  applied,
particularly, in the specific situation in which the prison population of  a
particular prison  is  reaching  such  proportions  that  it  constitutes  a
material and imminent threat  to  the  human  dignity,  physical  health  or
safety of an accused.

The Bill before  us  is  intended  to  ensure  that  poor  people  who  have
committed  minor  crimes  are  not  left  to  languish  in   jail,   pending
finalisation of their trials, purely  because  they  cannot  afford  to  pay
bail. This will ensure that all people are equal before  the  law  and  have
the right to equal protection and benefit of the  law  as  our  Constitution
dictates under section 12. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members might have  noticed
that the hon Mr Masutha is very proficient at braille. [Applause.]

Dr J T DELPORT: Mr Chairperson, allow me,  at  the  outset,  to  tender  the
apologies of Mrs Camerer, my colleague from the New NP who  cannot  be  here
today. I have no mandate to speak on her behalf, but I am  quite  sure  that
she will embrace everything that I say. [Interjections.]

Een van die aangrypendste oomblikke wat ek die afgelope twee tot  drie  jaar
in  hierdie  Parlement  beleef  het,  was  toe   die   President   van   die
Konstitusionele   Hof,   sy    edele    regter    Chaskalson,    voor    die
portefeuljekomitee kom getuig het. Hy  was  emosioneel  ontroer  toe  hy  sy
persoonlike ervaring en waarneming aan ons voorgelê het van hoe dit  in  ons
tronke lyk waar verhoorafwagtende  mense,  en  baie  van  hulle  op  kleiner
oortredings, aangehou word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[One of the most moving moments I experienced during the past two  or  three
years in this Parliament  was  when  the  President  of  the  Constitutional
Court, His Excellency  Mr  Justice  Chaskalson,  gave  evidence  before  the
portfolio committee. He was emotionally moved when he related  his  personal
experience and observation to us  about  conditions  in  our  prisons  where
people awaiting trial, and many of them for minor transgressions, are  being
detained.]

He was adamant that, from the point of view of  the  human  dignity  of  our
people, regarding their physical health and safety, we simply  cannot  allow
this situation to continue. We fully support this legislation that  will  at
least take out of prison those people who have committed  what  we  normally
call petty offences, and who cannot pay the R20, R50 or R100  bail  to  take
them out of those circumstances.

However, that does not solve the big problem because we are dealing with  an
aspect. We are making  a  contribution.  In  fact,  what  we  are  doing  by
accepting this Bill today is to admit that we  have  circumstances  contrary
to human dignity, physical health  and  safety.  We  need  more  and  better
facilities. We cannot wish away crime. We cannot let all accused go free  on
bail. Certainly not, because that, once again,  would  be  contrary  to  the
interests of the community. But we must, some way or  another,  ensure  that
more and better facilities are provided so that those who are being kept  as
awaiting trial persons are not exposed to inhumane circumstances.

Ons kan nie toelaat dat nog  meer  mense,  en  veral  jongmense,  se  lewens
geknak word in tronke nie. Te veel jongmense kom erger uit 'n tronk  as  wat
hulle daar ingegaan het. Te veel jongmense doen morele en/of  fisieke  skade
op van 'n omvang waarvan hulle nooit weer kan herstel nie.

Ons moet aandring, as Parlement, dat almal betrokke, veral  die  Departement
Korrektiewe Dienste en  die  Tesourie,  aan  hierdie  baie  belangrike  saak
aandag gee. Ons doel met 'n vonnis is mos nie net om die man te  straf  nie.
Ons doel is in die eerste plek hervorming. Dit is my  pleidooi,  dit  is  my
party se pleidooi, en ek  glo  dit  is  die  breë  gemeenskap  se  pleidooi.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We cannot allow the lives of more people, and especially young  people,  to
be shattered in prisons. Too many young  people  leave  prison  in  a  worse
state than they were in when they entered it.  Too  many  young  people  are
damaged morally and/or physically, to such an extent  that  they  can  never
recover again.

We, as Parliament, should insist that all  those  involved,  especially  the
Department of Correctional Services and  the  Treasury,  address  this  very
important issue. Surely what we intend to do by way of  a  sentence  is  not
only to punish the person. Our intent is primarily that of reform.  That  is
my plea, that is the plea of my party, and I believe it is the plea  of  the
broader community.]

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, the Judicial Matters Amendment  Bill  is  a  Bill
that seeks to address the problems faced by the Department  of  Correctional
Services  and  other   justice   authorities   regarding   overcrowding   in
correctional facilities.

We know that unemployment is an enemy to our  country.  It  is  often  found
that the  accused  persons  or  awaiting-trial  prisoners  are  given  small
amounts of bail, and yet they cannot  pay.  That  adds  to  the  problem  of
overcrowding.

The Bill will  assist  the  head  of  a  prison,  as  provided  for  in  the
Correctional Service Act 111 of 1998, to deal with the overcrowding. If  the
head of a prison  is  satisfied  that  the  population  of  that  prison  is
reaching such an alarming proportion that  it  constitutes  a  material  and
imminent threat to the human dignity,  physical  health  or  safety  of  the
accused who is charged with an offence that is not serious,  or  an  offence
that a police officer could have granted bail for, in terms of  section  59,
or when bail is granted by a lower court and there are no  further  charges,
then the head of that prison  may  apply  to  the  applicable  court  for  a
release of an accused on a warning, in the place of bail.

However, the application must be lodged in writing with  the  clerk  of  the
court. The application must be supported by an affidavit from the head of  a
prison and a written certificate from the Director of  Public  Prosecutions,
or an authorised person, that the prosecuting authority does not oppose  the
application. If the accused has an attorney, the attorney must  be  notified
of the  transaction.  The  clerk  of  the  court  must  place  the  relevant
application before the magistrate for consideration without delay.

The good thing about this is that the magistrate may even cause the  accused
to be present if  he  or  she  deems  it  necessary.  The  outcome  of  this
amendment is that the magistrate may release the accused  on  a  warning  to
appear before a specified court on a  specified  date  or  reduce  the  bail
amount.

The IFP believes that if this procedure is followed to the letter,  it  will
go  a  long  way  in  addressing  the  problems  facing  the  Department  of
Correctional Services, ie the  overcrowding  and  its  associated  financial
burdens. The IFP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr J T MASEKA: Chairperson, this Bill amends various  existing  Acts  within
the Department  of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  that  can  be
amended without having to enact a separate amendment  for  each  Act.  These
amendments include repealing certain redundant provisions and  filling  gaps
which have arisen in practice.

Clauses 6 and 7 of this Bill are very  important,  because  they  fill  gaps
that have arisen in practice. It is also very important to advise,  perhaps,
the Correctional  Services  officials  that  these  clauses  should  not  be
misused because some people might be  taken  to  court  for  bail  reduction
unnecessarily, even more so in the  case  of  people  who  pretend  to  have
committed  lesser  offences,  but  they  are  instead  the  most   dangerous
criminals.

The UDM supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairperson, the ACDP, in fact, alerted the  chairman  of  the
justice committee regarding problems with the  envisaged  amendment  to  the
Correctional Services Act. It was significant that this issue was raised  by
the hon Steve Swart after an address to the committee by the  Constitutional
Court President, judge Chaskalson, as the learned judge had referred to  the
appalling conditions which existed at the Diepkloof Prison.

The inspecting judge, Judge Fagan, has also drawn attention to the  inhumane
conditions in certain of our prisons, and the urgent  need  to  curtail  the
spread of disease, particularly HIV/Aids while this is still manageable.  Of
the total prison population of 168 497, there are 50 902 prisoners  awaiting
trial, many of whom may well be acquitted. Many thousands of these awaiting-
trial prisoners are exposed to appalling conditions  and  run  the  risk  of
becoming infected with HIV, thus resulting in an indirect death sentence.

Whilst  acknowledging  the  role  of  prisons  in  protecting  society  from
dangerous criminals, prisons are an expensive way  of  reinforcing  criminal
behaviour. This is particularly true in South African prisons.  And,  it  is
for this reason that members of  civil  society  need  to  lobby  Government
officials  and  parliamentarians  for  the  implementation  of   restorative
justice practices.

The ACDP will support this Bill. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the Judicial Matters  Amendment  Bill  appears
to centralise amendments made to a series of Bills,  which  certainly  serve
to save on paperwork and a series of individual sittings  which  would  have
been  required  to  cover  these  within  the  Department  of  Justice   and
Constitutional Development.

Having  to  rectify  deficiencies,  supplementing  and  filling   gaps   and
repealing  certain  redundant  provisions  are  to  be   addressed   through
combining a series of Bills within the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill.  The
question should be asked, noting the  allocation  of  time,  whether  it  is
possible to debate all these amendments within the allocated time to  enable
us to determine the validity of individual  amendments.  As  in  this  case,
amendments are made to 12 existing Bills via 38 clauses.

However, having viewed these clauses, it is noted that the  amendments  were
made  wisely  and  strategically.  The  MF  places  its  confidence  in  the
department's efforts to correct and improve these  Bills.  The  MF  supports
the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson,  I  am
essentially rising to thank  hon  members  for  this  very  good  and  short
discussion.

I have no doubt that Madam Sheila Camerer would have agreed with Dr  Delport
if she was here, because the sentiments  that  he  expressed  in  his  short
speech are shared by all of us. Indeed, we all owe it  to  ourselves  to  do
something about the conditions in our correctional service  facilities.  The
hon member should appreciate the efforts that are being  made.  New  prisons
are being built. We are even co-operating with the private sector  in  terms
of what we call Apops in order to address these problems.

We agree with the hon Dudley  that  we  also  need  to  research  the  whole
concept of restorative justice. As a department,  we  are  beginning  to  do
precisely that.

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

        CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND
   CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON CRIMINAL PROCEDURE SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

Order disposed of without debate.

Report adopted.

                  CRIMINAL PROCEDURE SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  the
Bill before the House is intended to give effect  to  the  Law  Commission's
recommendations. It has only two main objectives, namely, to give  statutory
recognition to the practice of plea bargaining, which  already  takes  place
in our courts; and to introduce the  new  practice  of  sentence  bargaining
into our criminal law.

Because the provisions of the Bill are self-explanatory,  I  do  not  intend
discussing them in any detail whatsoever. I commend the Bill to this  House.
[Applause.]

Ms F I CHOHAN-KOTA: Chairperson and hon members who are left,  I  have  been
given 12 minutes to deal with this Bill. I promise that  I  will  only  take
part of that time.

This Bill has been introduced now as  part  of  the  plan  to  simplify  and
streamline  the  criminal  justice  system.  Plea   discussions   and   plea
bargaining have happened in our courts on an informal basis  and  what  this
law is doing now is to regulate an informal practice in a manner that  takes
care to ensure that no injustices occur.

However, there are a few things to note with regard to this  Bill.  Firstly,
it does not apply to the unrepresented accused. We feel that, generally,  we
should discourage  the  practice  of  the  accused  standing  before  courts
without  legal  representation  as  our  Constitution  provides  for   legal
representation.

Secondly, we feel that if the  unrepresented  accused  were  covered,  there
would be an imbalance in the negotiating process in that this would pit  the
prosecutor, who is obviously well versed in the law and tenets of this  Act,
against the  accused,  who,  being  at  an  obvious  disadvantage,  will  be
vulnerable.

The last reason for this exclusion is to protect the integrity of  the  plea
agreement itself. Theoretically,  nothing  would  prevent  an  unrepresented
accused from challenging the agreement once  it  has  been  concluded.  This
would, again theoretically,  result  in  litigation  upon  litigation  which
would simply defeat the point of plea bargaining.
The second issue of note in this Bill is that there is a  role  created  for
victims of crime. In terms of the Act, the prosecutor, prior  to  finalising
a formal agreement with the accused, has to consult with  the  investigating
officer and the victim in the matter concerned. The victim  in  this  regard
is able to do two things. Firstly, they are able to make representations  as
to the proposed charge and sentence. Secondly, the victim can insist on  the
inclusion in the agreement of the compensation  provision  relating  to  any
damages suffered.

Some of us in the committee have been in favour, for a  long  time,  of  the
more frequent use of the existing mechanisms in the Criminal  Procedure  Act
to offer compensation to victims of crime. These  provision  have,  for  one
reason or another, fallen into disuse  in  our  courts.  It  is,  therefore,
particularly pleasing that compensation is specifically  mentioned  in  this
legislation  and  hopefully  will  assist  in  establishing  a  culture   of
restorative justice in our courts.

The final issue that requires some note is that of  minimum  sentences.  The
House, not  so  long  ago,  amended  this  very  Act  in  another  piece  of
legislation that we have coined the ``Minimum Sentences Legislation''.  This
Act provided for  minimum  sentences  for  very  serious  national  priority
crimes. It is vital that the measures in this  Bill  do  not  undermine  the
expression of the will of this Parliament in that other  amendment  to  this
particular Act.

To ensure this, we do provide some measures in the Bill. But, the main  task
will be that of the National Director of Public Prosecutions who  will  have
to compile directives and other matters in  this  regard.  We  keenly  await
these directives in the next few months.

It is important to note and we must stress  that  plea  bargaining  for  the
sake of obviating difficult and complex trials pertaining to serious  crimes
is not what this  is  about.  However,  plea  bargaining  reduces  the  time
required to be spent  on  straightforward,  open  and  shut  cases  so  that
prosecutors are able to invest more time and effort in serious  and  complex
crimes.

Before even embarking on plea bargaining negotiations, the  prosecutor  must
take the interests of the community into  consideration.  This  is  provided
for in this legislation. It is  for  this  reason  that  the  task  of  plea
bargaining will be handled by senior prosecutors  in  our  courts.  We  have
provided  that  the  directives  of  the   National   Director   of   Public
Prosecutions must be submitted before they become effective, so that  we  in
this House could have the  opportunity  to  make  an  input.  We  also  look
forward to receiving these directives within the next few months.

Finally, let me say that, as a committee, we are  under  no  illusions  that
this is a perfect Bill. There are  too  many  potential  contingencies  that
will arise in practice and many unknowns. It is therefore  safe  to  predict
that from time to time we are going to come back, revisit, amend,  twig  and
improve what we have in front of  us.  In  anticipation  of  this,  we  have
provided in the Bill itself that, once every year,  records  and  statistics
relating to the implementation and application of  this  Bill  in  practice,
must be submitted to Parliament. This is  like  an  in-built  oversight  and
monitoring mechanism.

However, having said this, I would be remiss if I  did  not  emphasise  that
this Bill marks a bold step towards the delivery of a quick,  efficient  and
more just justice regime in our courts. The department, the  Law  Commission
and this House itself should all justly and justifiably  be  proud  of  this
step.  I  have  no  hesitation  in  saying  that  the  ANC  completely   and
wholeheartedly supports this legislation. [Applause.]

Dr J T DELPORT: Chairperson and hon Minister, the DP supports this Bill.  In
fact, the hon the Minister will recall that this  was  one  of  the  aspects
that was mentioned by the DP during the  budget  debate  as  something  that
requires priority attention.

I am not going to repeat what my hon colleague has said  in  her  exposition
of the Bill. What we were very concerned with right from the outset was  the
dangers inherent in a system of plea bargaining  and  sentencing.  What  one
does not want is a perception by the public  that  some  things  are  agreed
upon in the backrooms, which they have no access to. That is one  point.  We
have remedied that. It takes place in an open court and the magistrate  must
put the agreement, questions and satisfy himself that both the plea and  the
sentence are just and appropriate.

Another  point  which  has  an  inherent  danger  is  the  problem   of   an
inexperienced  prosecutor  who  comes  up  against   a   very   intimidating
personality in the form of an old and experienced attorney or even a  senior
advocate. This is also being remedied and we want to refer to  the  valuable
advice of  Dr  D'Oliviera.  Only  prosecutors  authorised  by  the  National
Prosecuting Authority will be able to make such agreements.  I  can  imagine
that in the place where I am from, Port Elizabeth, there  may  be  three  to
five prosecutors who are the designated  authorised  people  who  can  enter
into agreements of this nature.

Another important aspect, and my colleague has referred to it, is  the  step
taken to promote restorative  justice.  It  would  seem  that  the  idea  of
compensation in the Act is not being used to its  full  extent  and  we  are
bringing this to the attention of the victims,  and  the  surviving  spouses
must also be given an opportunity to make inputs. In  many  instances,  such
as in motor car collisions, the criminal case and damages could  be  settled
once and for all. This is especially so in cases where  poor  people  cannot
afford long court cases. This is a very important innovation in our law.

We have known in the past that, to a certain extent, plea  bargaining  could
be accepted by prosecutors on a  charge  of  murder,  culpable  homicide  or
assault. This Bill, however, takes it to the full extent.  It  is  something
which we were cautious about in the committee. We  have  set  certain  fixed
parameters,  which  is  a  good  measure.  Let  this  develop  within  those
parameters  until  the  whole  culture  of  plea  bargaining  and   sentence
bargaining has become more part of our law. It should also  become  part  of
the curriculum at universities, where future legal  practitioners  could  be
equipped.

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, the  Criminal  Procedure  Second  Amendment  Bill
seeks to address the need to reduce the burden on court  cases.  We  support
the Bill. We do so because of  all  the  compelling  reasons  cited  in  the
committee meetings. We also do so on account of what the preceding  speakers
had to say from  the  podium  today.  This  is  indeed  another  small,  but
important step being taken to improve the efficiency of the  justice  system
and remove bottlenecks which lead to long delays. It is  common  cause  with
us that justice delayed is justice denied.

Out of all the agreements we have had, one  more  thing  that  needs  to  be
agreed upon is the completion of the consensus. This entails  educating  the
South African public. Laws can be outstanding, just,  clear,  concise,  well
written, modern and in keeping with the best, but  what  good  are  they  if
they are not understood by everyone. We should make them our own.

Crime in our country has many causes,  and  estrangement  from  the  law  is
probably one of the most important. In the case of a plea bargain,  one  has
access to many American  films  in  which  this  occurs.  Government  should
encourage scriptwriters to include new advances in justice as  soon  as  the
President's ink has dried on this Act of  Parliament.  Film  and  video  are
effective means of translating what is so clear to the Johnny de  Langes  or
the Penuell Madunas of this world.

Film and video allow the ordinary citizen  to  understand  in  a  real  life
situation, how the law works and what implications it has.  Plea  bargaining
will soon be a way of life in our courts. Can we replace LA  Law  with  ``SA
Law'' on our TV screens? I also wish to make a plea for plea  bargaining  to
be scripted into dramas for the small and big screens.

Mr J T MASEKA: Chairperson and hon members, this amending  Bill  facilitates
plea bargaining between the prosecutor and an accused person  or  his  legal
representative, which is entered into before an  accused  person  pleads  to
the charge against him or her. This agreement is in respect  of  a  plea  of
guilty by the accused to an offence of which he or she may be convicted.

Furthermore, this Bill relates to the appropriate negotiated sentence to  be
imposed  in  the  event  of  the  accused  being  found  guilty.  This  plea
bargaining helps to shorten the trial and  will  also  help  to  reduce  the
backlog of cases in courts.

It is also important that accused persons who are not represented  in  court
should  have  fair  trials.  Prosecutors  who  are  to  conduct  this   plea
bargaining process should also take the interest of an accused  person  into
consideration. The UDM supports the Bill.

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairperson,  the  ACDP  has  been  promoting  the  concept  of
restorative justice for  some  time  now.  The  appeal  of  the  restorative
justice model, particularly when considered  against  the  backlog,  is  the
acceptance of blame by the offender and the recognition of the need to  make
restitution to the victim. Unfortunately, this has not been the  traditional
approach where the offender has, in fact,  sought  to  evade  accountability
and the legal process has degenerated into a contest between the  state  and
the defence lawyers to establish guilt or obtain an acquittal.

This amending Bill applies restorative justice  premised  upon  the  accused
accepting blame by pleading guilty. The plea bargaining takes place  subject
to existing legislation regarding minimum sentences.

The ACDP particularly welcomes the fact that victims of  crime  must,  where
it is reasonably possible to do so, be  afforded  the  opportunity  to  make
representations regarding the contents of the agreement  and  the  inclusion
of a condition  relating  to  the  compensation  of  the  rendering  to  the
complainant of some specific benefit or service.

The prosecutor must also consult regarding the interests of  the  community.
Thus not only are victims' rights  included,  but  community  interests  are
also considered. The ACDP welcomes this Bill.

Miss  S  RAJBALLY:  Chairperson,  though  considered  legal,   the   current
situation of prosecutors and accused persons  entering  into  informal  plea
discussions  and  plea  negotiations,  does  need   to   regulate   sentence
bargaining, for which the Criminal Procedure Act of 1977 failed to  provide.


In 1992 a survey of 72 of the world's most  populous  countries  found  that
guilty pleas accounted for 92% of all convictions in  state  courts.  It  is
now 2001 and as to whether those statistics have escalated  or  depreciated,
plea bargaining plays its role here.

Noting  the   complexities   that   accompany   criminal   procedures,   the
investigation to simplify this process, especially  in  the  light  of  plea
bargaining, has been adequately  addressed.  The  Bill  aims  to  allow  the
prosecutor and the accused person to  negotiate  and  enter  into  agreement
concerning a sentence if the accused is found guilty. The  question  arising
from this is whether this will  not  cause  tension  between  the  presiding
officers and the prosecutors as a result of the powers which the Bill  gives
to the prosecutors?

The MF supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, my apologies  for  missing  out  on  the  previous
debate. I was, for a few moments, out of the House. The proceedings went  so
fast that when I came back the debate was concluded. So I wanted to  support
that Bill.

The overcrowded courtrooms form the background to this Bill,  which  support
it. I think that this Bill will relieve this situation considerably.

Die AEB pleit reeds geruime tyd vir iets soos die Hof  vir  Klein  Eise  wat
siviele sake behartig, wat kriminele  sake  met  eenvoudiger  prosedure  kan
bespoedig. Dié wetsontwerp kan iets daarvan beantwoord.

Die vraag kan gevra word of die regsbeginsel van ordelike regsproses nie  in
gedrang kom nie. Ons het reeds pleitonderhandelinge met betrekking  tot  die
uitspraak, skuldig of nie, en dit word nou  na  die  vonnis  uitgebrei.  Ons
voorsien geen probleem daarmee nie.

Met verkeersoortredings het ons reeds  jare  lank  pleitonderhandelinge  met
betrekking tot die vonnis. Daar word vooraf oor boetes  onderhandel,  sonder
'n hofsaak. Daarom glo ons dat dit in beginsel reg is.  Net  een  vraag  aan
die Minister. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The AEB has been pleading for a considerable time for something similar  to
the Small Claims Court which deals with civil cases,  to  expedite  criminal
cases by means of a simpler procedure.  This  Bill  can  contribute  to  our
achieving this goal.

The question may be asked whether the legal principle of orderly process  of
law is not being jeopardised. We already have plea  bargaining  with  regard
to the verdict, guilty or not,  and  this  is  now  being  extended  to  the
sentence. We foresee no problems in this regard.

In respect of traffic offences we have had plea bargaining  with  regard  to
sentences for many years. Fines are negotiated in advance, without  a  court
case. We therefore believe it to be right in principle. I  would  just  like
to ask the Minister one question.]

I always thought that there would be a limit - a ceiling - that  one  cannot
have murder and serious cases on this procedure. But I can  see  that  there
is no such thing in the Bill. Can the hon the Minister put us at ease as  to
why the process will not be endangered by the difficult and  serious  cases?
I thought that the process would  only  apply  in  less  serious  cases.  We
support the Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson,  I  am
rising to thank hon members for such a good and yet  very  short  debate  on
this Bill. We deliberately sped through the first debate because we did  not
deem it wise to listen  to  the  hon  member  Aucamp.  We  knew  his  views.
[Interjections.]

Mr C AUCAMP: I know the hon Minister's views too.

The  MINISTER:  But,  of  course,  we  missed  him.  There  are  no  limits,
deliberately because we want to leave these matters  in  the  hands  of  the
prosecutors and the courts.

It has been said by other speakers that, indeed, the courts would  have  the
final say  because  they  would  have  to  accept  the  plea  or  sentencing
agreement. If the court does not accept it, for whatever  reasons,  it  does
not matter whether one is  talking  about  possession  of  a  few  grams  of
cocaine or dagga, or about murder, then there  is  no  agreement.  The  case
proceeds as though there has never been an agreement at all.
Madam  Chohan-Kota  said  that  we  should  hasten  the  provision  of   the
guidelines. I will definitely make sure that that does happen,  because  the
system cannot work without proper guidelines in place.

The hon member Mzizi said that  we  should  replace  ``LA  Law''  with  ``SA
Law''. I will ask the hon member himself to  convey  this  sentiment  to  my
colleague Dr Ben Ngubane. But I must  say  that  in  some  instances  it  is
already happening. One will  see  attempts  on  SABC  1  and  2  to  present
something about the criminal justice system on television.  But  I  am  sure
that we can do a bit more than that. With those few words, I would  like  to
express my gratitude to the Chairperson and hon members. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                          LOTTERIES AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)
The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson,  those  who  were  clapping
and hoping that I  might  have  the  numbers  for  the  next  draw,  I  must
disappoint them. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]  I  would  like  to  begin  by
first thanking the committee and the House for agreeing  to  fast-track  the
progress of the Bill through.

This relates to one issue only in the amendment,  and  that  is  promotional
competitions. Those hon members who were involved from  the  beginning  will
recall  that  there  was  much  discussion  on  this   matter.   Promotional
competitions really have two dimensions to them, which we are  dealing  with
in this piece of legislation. One is the potential  for  these  competitions
to proliferate and possibly compete with  the  National  Lottery.  Secondly,
there are certain aspects of these competitions which consumers need  to  be
protected against.

In the original Act as it was passed, we put a quite  severe  limit  on  the
promotional  competitions.  Subsequently,  as  was  agreed,  we  have   done
considerable research on this matter and I think  that  our  view  is  quite
clear that the restriction to R1  million  was  not  workable  and  we  have
tightened up slightly on the consumer protection aspects.

I am pleased that the amendment has gone through and  it  will  clarify  the
position and probably allow for a number of promotional competitions in  the
Christmas  period,  during  which  hon  members  stand  a  chance  of  doing
something useful and interesting.  I  hope  hon  members  will  support  the
amendment. [Applause.]

Mrs B N SONO: Mr Chairperson and hon members, section 54  of  the  Lotteries
Act of 1997 makes provision for the regulation of promotional  competitions.
It also places an obligation on the Minister who administers  the  Act,  the
Minister  of  Trade  and  Industry,  to  make  regulations  in  respect   of
promotional competitions  prescribing  matters  not  provided  for  in  that
section.

It is an improvement on what it was initially. It makes it easier for  other
competitions to exist within the country. The DP supports any  measure  that
curtail the Minister's ability to impose a monopoly.

Again, in view of the fact that the National Lottery Fund has been  slow  in
allocating funds to charities, this amending Bill makes it easier  for  some
charities to run their own competitions and, thereby, be more efficient.

The DP supports the Bill.

Mr D LOCKEY: Mr Chairperson, I have been  under  pressure  not  to  use  the
allotted 12 minutes. This Bill amends the Lotteries Act of 1997 relating  to
matters connected with promotional competitions.

Section 54 of the principal Act regulates such promotional competitions.  It
empowers the Minister of  Trade  and  Industry  to  make  regulations  which
govern the scope of operation of such competitions.

The main purpose of section 54 is to protect the national lottery and  other
lotteries from the potentially adverse effects of promotional  competitions.
One has to stretch the imagination to comprehend  why  this  protection  was
deemed necessary, particularly given the runaway  success  of  the  national
lottery in South Africa.

Even our beer consumption has declined significantly since the  introduction
of the national lottery. It appears, therefore, that there is  no  need  for
such overzealous protection. An extensive survey of the  marketing  industry
in South  Africa  has  found  that  section  54  was  too  restrictive  and,
secondly, that some of these provisions were impractical and  not  conducive
to bona fide marketing practice. The objective of this Bill,  therefore,  is
to repeal unnecessarily restrictive provisions.

The Bill still contains adequate protection for  the  consumer  against  any
negative influence that might arise through the  conduct  of  a  promotional
competition. The Minister still has the power  to  regulate  the  accounting
procedures and the process of identifying the winner of such a  competition.
Promotional competitions may also not  add  to  the  regular  price  of  the
product being promoted, but  a  promotional  campaign  can  be  run  with  a
significant discount to the product being promoted.

The Bill received widespread support from the marketing  industry,  and  the
ANC supports the amending Bill. [Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Mr Chairman, the Lotto is the  first  national  lottery  that
has ever been introduced in South Africa.  Logically,  with  uncertainty  in
mind, legislation prohibiting any other form  of  lottery  had  to  be  very
stringent at that time. At that time, also, the original goal determined  by
the portfolio committee with  regard  to  section  54  was  to  protect  the
national lottery against competition.

Public response against the draft regulations in terms  of  section  54  was
overwhelmingly negative, and it was argued that they were not practical  and
hostile  to  accepted  marketing  practice  and  restrictive   on   business
operations. Responses were also critical of the fact that the maximum  value
of the prizes was limited to R1 million annually.

The  National  Lotteries  Board   has   now   concluded   that   promotional
competitions had not negatively affected the national lottery and  that  the
very restrictive conditions of section 54 could be amended  to  retain  just
those aspects that provided the public with protection. The effect  of  this
legislation is that promotional competition is no  longer  unlawful  if  the
purchase of goods or the use of the service  promoted  by  that  promotional
competition falls into line with these particular aspects.

The Bill, therefore, amends section 54 of  the  Lotteries  Act  of  1997  by
repealing unnecessary limits and protective measures.  The  reality  of  the
situation  is   that   promotional   competitions   which   were   conducted
continually, even  after  they  were  outlawed  in  terms  of  the  original
Gambling Act, are of vital importance and serve as a marketing tool for  any
business that operates in the public domain by selling goods and services.
They form an integral part of advertising and  promotion  campaigns,  create
jobs, stimulate economic activity and  enhance  consumer  participation  and
spending in the goods and services field. Furthermore,  since  the  national
lottery has, as such, been a huge success and promotional competitions  seem
not to have harmed it in any way, this Bill  is  fully  in  order.  The  IFP
will, therefore, support this Bill. [Applause.]

Dr R T RHODA: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  members,  the  Lotteries
Amendment Bill is very straightforward and very clear and, at the outset,  I
will say that the New NP supports the Bill.

Because promotional competitions are an important part of the marketing  mix
and a legitimate business tool today, and  because  the  original  draft  of
section 54 of the Lotteries Act of 1997 would have had the effect of  making
many promotional competitions unlawful, and  I  believe  this  was  not  the
intention of the legislation, the National  Lotteries  Board  requested  the
Bureau of Market Research of the University  of  South  Africa  to   conduct
research into promotional competitions and to report on the possible  effect
of the draft regulations on promotional competitions.

After consideration of the report, the National Lotteries Board  recommended
that section 54 be amended quite extensively. Persons most affected,  namely
the members of the Marketing Association of  South  Africa  and  the  Direct
Marketing Association of South  Africa,  now  state  that  they  are  highly
pleased  and  note  that  the  amendment  recognises   the   legitimacy   of
promotional competitions, and that section 54, as stated in the  objects  of
the amending Bill, retains provisions  to  protect  the  general  public  at
large.

We support the Bill.

Mr C T FROLICK: Mr Chairperson and hon members, the  aim  of  the  Lotteries
Amendment Bill is to amend section 54 of the original Act.

Extensive public comments were received by the National Lotteries  Board  on
the regulations drafted and published in terms of section  54  of  the  Act.
The submissions received were mostly negative and claimed that that  section
was impractical, unimplementable, hostile to and not cognisant  of  accepted
marketing practice and  realities,  and  unduly  restrictive  on  bona  fide
business operations.

Indeed, promotional competitions are an important part of marketing and  the
original draft would have made such competitions  unlawful.  The  Bureau  of
Market Research at Unisa was started by  the  National  Lotteries  Board  to
conduct  research  regarding  these  competitions.  The  Board   based   its
recommendations to the Minister on this research.

The UDM concurs that amendments  to  section  54  of  the  Act  retains  the
provisions necessary to achieve the  intended  objectives  of  the  section,
namely the protection of the  general  public.  Simultaneously,  unnecessary
limits and protective measures are repealed.

The UDM supports the Lotteries Amendment Bill, as amended.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Mr Chairman, March 2000 saw  the  coming  into  being  of  the
national lottery. The first lottery game, the Lotto, has an average  jackpot
win of several million rands per week, and people have spent more than  R3,4
billion on the lottery since it began.

The lotteries are  accessible  to  communities  previously  inaccessible  to
legalised forms of gambling and are available from more than  7000  outlets,
countrywide. The lottery is a  no-risk  monopoly  which  purports  to  exist
primarily to support good causes. In fact, it is  a  risk-free  licence  for
Government to print money, and this Bill affords even  more  protection  for
this monopoly.

So far its performance has been appalling and the  consequences  being  that
charities have in fact suffered and not benefited, receiving less  later  or
nothing at all. In addition, questionable new causes  have  been  supported,
such as established rugby teams like the Blue Bulls.

Only in so far as this Bill restricts gambling would we agree with it.  Anne
Crotty had already summed it up in Business Report last year,  saying  that,
indeed, looking back  over  the  past  years,  one  would  be  forgiven  for
thinking that there was a concerted attempt by business and  the  Government
to shrink the economy.

Within six weeks of the launch of the  lottery,  consumer-related  companies
were warning of its effects on their sales and bottom line. Now, every  week
corporate results reveal the strain of the huge shift that is  occurring  in
consumer demands. It is not just the  food  and  clothing  groups  that  are
suffering. It is also the furniture retailers. The  lottery  has  absolutely
no positive economic impact, and its effect is 99,9% negative.

George Bernard Shaw said  the  lottery  is  a  tax  on  people  who  do  not
understand  maths.  However,  more  distressing  than  this  is  that   this
predominantly  attacks  the  poor.  Rich  people  buy  lottery  tickets  for
distraction. Poor people buy them out of desperation. Even the  Minister  of
Social Development has acknowledged that his budget is funding the  gambling
industry in South Africa.

The ACDP believes that the lottery should be  terminated  or,  at  the  very
least, become a section 21 company where  all  profits  are  distributed  to
charities and not to shareholders sitting overseas,  profiting  out  of  the
hardships of South Africans. The ACDP and the  AEB,  who  allowed  me  their
time, will not be supporting this Bill. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, since the introduction of  the  lottery  to
South Africa, people have flocked to purchase tickets for the chance to  win
the millions put up for grabs.

It is noted that the earlier Bill allocated  provisions  that  were  not  in
order and the amendments made in this Bill serve  to  correct  that.  It  is
nice to note that the close  working  relationship  between  Government  and
research institute as well as the para-research conducted by the  Bureau  of
Market Research of the University of South Africa  has  adequately  supplied
research that assisted with the formation of the amendment made.

The now-amended Bill appears to be in order and has no real  effect  on  the
running of the lottery. Although it contradicts many religious beliefs,  the
lottery has instilled hope in many South Africans  who  wish  for  a  better
life than one of poverty.

The MF supports this Bill. Tata Ma Chance, Tata Ma Millions. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Mr Chairperson, I  thank  those  parties
that supported the Bill. I must say it was somewhat of a pleasure to have  a
relatively sensible input coming from my left for a change.

I fully respect the rights of the religious-based parties to be  opposed  to
the lottery and it is good  to  see  causes  supported  with  such  passion.
However, I do think that we should  keep  a  sense  of  perspective  on  the
facts. There is no argument  that,  I  think,  can  be  sustained  that  the
performance of the lottery has been appalling.

Regarding the purported shifts in expenditure from  the  furniture  industry
and all others, this is really not something that a  coherent  case  can  be
made of. Shifts in expenditure are occurring all  the  time.  The  furniture
industry is one of the best performing industries in the  economy,  and  one
of the fastest growing sectors in the economy. So, all these tales  that  we
heard about shifts towards cellphones, etc, are just the  ordinary  workings
of any economy.

It seems to me that it would be a far better situation that, if  people  are
going to gamble, and I am afraid people gamble worldwide, it should be  done
in a manner that is regulated and,  through  the  lottery  we  can  have  an
important impact on ordinary people. To say that the charities  will  suffer
is just not correct. The system of distribution that we have  put  in  place
far  exceeds,  in  terms  of  credential   requirement,   transparency   and
efficiency, anything that has been put in place in South Africa before.

We have completed the first phase  of  distributions,  and  members  in  the
House  will  recall  what  that  was  about.  That  was  for  urgent   cases
particularly related to children and poverty. We are  now  going  through  a
much wider process of putting things  out  for  distribution.  Four  hundred
million rands is available for distribution this year. The  impact  that  we
can have on charities and good causes, with this, is outstanding.

I think it is not correct or  useful  to  attack  the  allocations  made  to
sporting bodies.  This  is  a  very  important  part  of  our  society.  The
activities for which these funds were given to these  sporting  associations
were  to  build  facilities  and  programmes  for  the  youth.  That  is  an
outstanding cause, and we will continue to  provide  funds  for  outstanding
causes. We will begin moving into the arts and culture domain, so  that  the
gambling that the people do, the causes that we will  eventually  use  these
funds for, are very useful.
I make these points because I think it is important that we have a sense  of
pride in and ownership of the good causes that we have.  We,  as  Government
have moved prudentially. I will not make any apologies  for  that.  We  have
put in place  a  distribution  mechanism  that  identifies  each  and  every
recipient and, where it  is  possible,  to  track,  at  any  time,  what  is
happening to those funds.

If we are going to distribute money as Government, we  must  do  it  in  the
best possible way. We have done that. I do not apologise for that.  I  thank
the House for its support. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Mrs C DUDLEY: I would like the objection of the ACDP recorded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Your objection will be recorded.

Mrs  C  DUDLEY:  I  would  like  the  objection  of  the   AEB   noted   ...
[Interjections.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, I would like the objection of the AEB recorded.

I also have a point of order I want to raise. In her speech  on  my  behalf,
the hon Dudley referred to the Blue Bulls as an ``established'' rugby  team.
I think that is an overstatement. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  Mrs  Dudley,  you  do  not
move an objection on behalf of another party. You only do it behalf of  your
own party. [Interjections.]
