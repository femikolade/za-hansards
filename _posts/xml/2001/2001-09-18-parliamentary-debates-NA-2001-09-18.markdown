                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr D M GUMEDE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the United States is gearing itself to retaliate with the
       use of maximum force in the wake of the recent attack on the World
       Trade Centre and the Pentagon;


  (2) further notes that the United States is mobilising the international
       community to support ``the new war'' it is going to embark on;


  (3) wishes to restate our condemnation of those who were involved in the
       terror acts and the need for those who committed this horrendous act
       to be brought to book;


  (4) calls upon the United States not to embark on actions that will
       result in -


       (a)  the killing of innocent, unarmed and helpless civilians,
           especially women and children;


       (b)  the spreading of anti-Islam and anti-Arab sentiments; and


       (c)  spiralling violence, bloody wars and terrorism; and

       work towards strengthening world peace.

[Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House notes -


  (1) that the ANC is constantly sidelining Parliament, and that while it
       sold itself as a party for the people, it has become a party that
       arrogantly thinks it knows what is best for the people, instead of
       listening to them;


  (2) that Parliament is meant to be the throbbing heart of our democracy
       where public representatives are meant to do the people's business;
       and


  (3) that the DA has, therefore, decided to launch a post-box-to-
       parliament campaign which will stretch over the next five weeks, in
       order to reconnect ordinary people who are marginalised by the ANC
       and their elected representatives and give them back their voice in
       government.

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern and sympathy the extensive damage the unexpected
       cold weather has caused in Northern KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State;


  (2) further notes the great loss of livestock that the farmers in these
       areas have suffered, in particular the Vryheid area where more than 2
       000 head of cattle, plus hundreds of sheep and game were killed; and


  (3) calls upon the Government to investigate the situation thoroughly and
       assist the farmers.

Mr M U KALAKO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that two Stellenbosch brothers were arrested for allegedly
       sending a hoax e-mail to major corporations, claiming South African
       involvement in the American terror attacks;


  (2) further notes that the two brothers appeared in the Stellenbosch
       Magistrate's Court yesterday;


  (3) condemns this hoax unreservedly as an irresponsible act that gives
       the Republic of South Africa a bad name; and


  (4) commends the police for acting swiftly and bringing these alleged
       culprits to book.

[Applause.]

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the
next sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House condemns the following acts of sabotage against the value
  of the rand:


  (1) Eastern Cape Premier Stofile's reported statement that the terrorist
       attacks on the United States were not acts of cowardice, but rather
       of tactics;


  (2) the vastly disruptive strike action by Cosatu against privatisation
       and the lack of political will within the governing alliance to
       proceed with real privatisation;


  (3) the inflammatory statements by the PAC secretary-general, in support
       of the Zimbabwe land grabs;


  (4) Minister Steve Tshwete's as yet unsubstantiated allegations of a plot
       against the President; and


  (5) the policy of silent diplomacy and appeasement towards the
       increasingly dictatorial government of President Robert Mugabe of
       Zimbabwe.

[Applause.]

Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with alarm the killing of seven people in taxi-related violence
           between Qumbu and Mount Frere; and


       (b)  the killing of two people at Engcobo, as well as numerous other
           reports relating to taxi violence;


  (2) expresses its concern that these attacks undermine the National Taxi
       Conference resolutions that are aimed at stabilising this volatile
       situation; and
  (3) calls on taxi-owners and drivers to unite and stabilise the industry
       that they are dependent on for their livelihood.

Ms P N MNANDI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:

       military raids if Mr Yasser Arafat declares a truce;

[Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the irresponsible and reckless driving of White Mohapi,
       brother of the Speaker of the Free State Legislature, who was
       allegedly driving at 210 km/h, is unacceptable; and


  (2) calls -


       (a)  for a further enquiry as to why he was driving a vehicle
           belonging to the provincial legislature when he is not employed
           at the legislature; and


       (b)  on the ANC-led government in the Free State to be honest and
           transparent when dealing with this issue and not to allow it to
           be swept under the carpet.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis met sorg kennis neem van die besluit van die Minister van
  Onderwys en sy ministersraad om privaatskole se reg tot eie
  matriekeksamen onder sertifikasie van die Onafhanklike Eksamenraad te
  beëindig, en wel op grond van die volgende:


  (1) die Grondwet stel drie vereistes vir privaatskole, naanlik nie-
       diskriminasie, registrasie by die owerheid en standaarde gelyk aan
       dié van staatskole en minister Asmal het nou arbitrêr 'n vierde
       vereiste bygevoeg toe hy sy rede vir die maatreël aangegee het as dat
       privaatskole ``nie die filosofiese grondslag en Suid-Afrikaanse
       waardes van Kurrikulum 2005 deel nie'';


  (2) die hoofrede vir die voorsiening van privaatskole in die Grondwet is
       juis om voorsiening te maak vir die diversiteit in etos, filosofie en
       wettige lewensbeskoulike differensiasie; en


     3) die beoogde optrede van die Minister is ongrondwetlik en die AEB het
        reeds sy regsadviseurs opdrag gegee om hulle voor te berei om die
        filosofiese imperialisme grondliggend aan dié besluit in die
        Konstitusionele Hof te beveg.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House notes with concern the decision by the Minister of
  Education and his ministers' council to suspend the right of private
  schools to their own matriculation examination under certification of the
  Independent Examination Board, on the basis of the following:


  (1) the Constitution prescribes three requirements for private schools,
       namely nondiscrimination, registration with the authorities and
       standards equal to those of public schools, and Minister Asmal has
       now arbitrarily added a fourth requirement by indicating that his
       reason for the measure is that private schools ``do not share the
       philosophical basis and South African values of Curriculum 2005";


  (2) the primary reason for providing for private schools in the
       Constitution is precisely to make provision for the diversity in
       ethos, philosophy and legitimate ideological differentiation; and


  (3) the envisaged action by the Minister is unconstitutional and the AEB
       has already instructed its legal advisers to prepare themselves to
       challenge the philosophical imperialism which is fundamental to this
       decision in the Constitutional Court.]

Dr A S NKOMO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Mr Stephen Lewis, the United Nations envoy on HIV and Aids,
           visited South Africa recently; and


       (b)  Mr Lewis has remarked that South Africa has high levels of
           HIV/Aids awareness;


  (2) recognises, along with the Abuja Conference and the United Nations
       General Assembly's special session on HIV and Aids, that primary
       prevention remains the most effective measure, amongst many, in the
       campaign to combat the spread of HIV/Aids; and


  (3) welcomes the finding by the UN envoy on HIV/Aids, Mr Stephen Lewis,
       as this augurs well for the South African Government's plan to rein
       in and stem the tide of HIV and Aids.

[Applause.]

Mnr A J BOTHA: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:
  Dat die Huis -


  (1) simpatie betoon met die boere van die Vrystaat en KwaZulu-Natal wat
       ongekende veeverliese gely het tydens die onlangse abnormale
       weerstoestande;


  (2) besef dat die volle omvang van die skade nog nie bepaal is nie, maar
       dat dit reeds bekend is dat derduisende stuks groot- en kleinvee en
       wild verkluim het;


  (3) daarop let dat die ongekende weerstoestande en voorafgaande
       veldbrande die gemeenskappe só swaar getref het dat vele beswaarlik
       die ekonomiese verliese, wat na beraming R30 miljoen kan beloop, sal
       oorleef; en


     4) die Regering versoek om 'n noodtoestand te verklaar om hierdie
        onvoorsiene ramp te hanteer.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A J BOTHA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses sympathy with the farmers of the Free State and KwaZulu-
       Natal who have suffered unprecedented stock losses during the recent
       abnormal weather conditions;


  (2) realises that the full extent of the damage has not yet been
       determined, but that thousands of head of large and small stock and
       game are already known to have frozen to death;


  (3) notes that the unprecedented weather conditions and preceding veld
       fires have hit the communities so hard that many will have difficulty
       in surviving the economic losses, which could amount to an estimated
       R30 million; and


  (4) requests the Government to declare a state of emergency to deal with
       this unforeseen disaster.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:
  That the House -


  (1) applauds the officials who last week swooped on several Cape Town
       companies believed to have routed frozen fish contaminated with
       mercury through their offices to markets in the European Union;


  (2) notes with dismay that about 350 false South African Bureau of
       Standards (SABS) certificates were used in the scam; and


  (3) urges the relevant authorities to persist with this and other
       operations in order to stop similar scams from taking place in the
       future.

           in ward 793-0013 in the Ekurhuleni metro with 87,5%; and


       (b)  the ANC won these elections overwhelmingly despite a sustained
           attack on the ANC and the mayor, Comrade Bavumile Vilakazi;


  (2) believes that the outcome of these elections confirms the support for
       the ANC and our agenda for transformation; and


  (3) congratulates Comrade Tuoane on his victory in these elections.

Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that according to the findings of the Medical Research
       Council's report, ``The Impact of HIV/Aids on Adult Mortality in
       South Africa'' -


       (a)  40% of the deaths of those aged between 15 and 49 last year were
           due to the pandemic; and


       (b)  HIV/Aids will soon outstrip all other causes of death in South
           Africa;


  (2) further notes the Government's feeble attempts to eradicate this
       disease by allocating only 0,6% of the health budget for 2000/01 to
       combating HIV/Aids; and


  (3) hopes this report removes any doubts about the existence of HIV/Aids
       and its catastrophic impact on South Africa and that we will finally
       see a much more determined attack from the country's leadership to
       eradicate this virus from our country.

day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -

           affected commercial farmers, farm workers and pastoralists, and
           this has assumed catastrophic proportions;


       (b)  veld fires have devastated grazing and fodder supplies, caused
           loss of human life and stock and property, whilst the freak cold
           spell has caused the deaths of thousands of cattle, sheep, game
           and other livestock, including birds; and

                        PENSION FUNDS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker and hon members, the Bill
before the House today proposes to amend the Pension Funds Act of 1956.
This is in order to achieve four broad objectives in connection with
housing loans. Firstly, it seeks to clarify certain provisions of the
principal Act; secondly, to ensure the protection of members; thirdly, to
extend housing assistance to more members; and fourthly, to ensure that we
curb possible abuses.

In terms of existing legislation, uncertainty existed as to the conditions
under which a pension fund may furnish guarantees to financial institutions
and whether it could recover amounts owing to it from members immediately
when they default on loan repayments. Only members who had property
registered in their names qualified for housing assistance. The amount owed
by a member on a housing loan at his or her retirement, could have depleted
the whole pension benefit.

We have a number of amendments that seek to achieve clarification on
certain provisions of the principal Act. The first amendment seeks to
update the definition of fair value. A further amendment makes it clear
that a fund may furnish a guarantee to an institution for it to grant a
loan to a member under the same condition as a loan granted directly by the
fund. Another amendment allows the fund to deduct the money owing to it,
through a guarantee or a direct loan on the date of transfer if the loan or
guarantee cannot be transferred or settled. The fund is also permitted to
deduct any amounts owing to it when a member defaults on a loan repayment,
where the fund made a direct loan or a guarantee was furnished. The final
amendment which seeks to clarify provisions of the principal Act provides
that the fund can deduct the amount it is owed from the benefit to which
the member becomes entitled to on the termination of membership, at the
time of transfer to another fund or on default.

As regards amendments to ensure the protection of the fund and members, we
have an amendment that allows members to negotiate a lower rate of interest
with financial institutions in the case of a guarantee furnished by the
fund than that which is prescribed for a direct loan by the fund. The fact
that the loan to the member by the fund is fully guaranteed, should make
this possible.
A further amendment also provides that the outstanding loan shall not
exceed one third of the members' benefit at retirement. This will secure a
cash-flow income for the member after retirement. Further amendments make
it clear that the amount of benefits pledged is the amount at the time of
granting the loan. On the extension of housing assistance to more members,
an amendment to section 199(5) extends ownership to the right of occupation
of immovable property by virtue of the operation of any custom or law. This
will enable more members to avail themselves of the housing assistance from
their funds.

Joint ownership of the property by the member and his or her spouse also
qualifies for housing assistance. To ensure that we curb possible abuses,
we have effected amendments that empower the Minister to make regulations
and prescribe conditions for loans or guarantees should it become
necessary. We also enabled the Minister to prescribe additional conditions
for the purposes under which a fund may grant a loan or furnish a
guarantee.

This is a Bill that has been widely consulted on and was thoroughly debated
in the portfolio committee. In summary, one should say that the Bill seeks
to achieve the following things. It clarifies the position of a pension
fund to issue guarantees for a housing loan by stating it explicitly.
Secondly, it broadens the concept of home ownership. Thirdly, it allows
institutions not to be bound by the prescribed interest rates. Fourthly, it
ensures that members retain two thirds of their benefits after paying off
their home loans at retirement.  Finally, it enables pension funds to
recover outstanding loans when a member defaults on a loan or is
transferred to another fund.

We would respectfully recommend that the House approves this Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr M M S LEKGORO: Modulasetulo, lehono ke ema mo pele ga Ngwako wo ke
bolela e le letsatsi la International Peace. [Chairperson, today I stand
before this House and speak on this day of International Peace.]

I feel very honoured to be given this opportunity to speak on this
important topic of expanding the provision of housing through the Pension
Funds Amendment Bill. This is more so because today we find ourselves in an
environment that is tense after the developments that took place recently.
Modern economic developments have made our lives dependent on financial
services provided by a variety of financial service institutions such as
banks. We depend on these organisations to finance our education, housing
and other important services. These services are fast becoming part of our
way of life and culture. They contribute to the improvement of the quality
of our lives. For this reason, these services must be expanded to reach as
many people as possible.

Today most people, young and old, have difficulty in accessing home loans
provided by different banks. This difficulty is mainly because most of
these people do not have securities to back up their home loans. On the
other hand, banks are reluctant to take risks by financing people without
sound financial security. The unfortunate effect of this situation is that
thousands upon thousands of working people, including those with
significant pension savings, are refused home loans. As a result, these
people turn to the state for their housing needs.

This aggravates the already unbearable dependence on the state in that
people who could be providing for themselves, now look to the state for
their housing needs. The Bill before the House seeks to make an
intervention in this particular regard. It will make it possible for
members of pension funds with substantial savings to use their individual
accumulated savings, to guarantee their home loans.

This Bill introduces a paradigm shift in the pension regime in that it
starts to look at the house as one of the main items which a pensioner
should of necessity have at the time of his or her retirement. Gone will be
the days when a pension means lump-sum cash payments and monthly payments
to the pensioner. Pensions will now start including important things like a
house and so on.

Let us look at this matter this way. It cannot be argued that a pensioner
with all the resources provided for by the current pension funds, but
without a home, is adequately provided for. This amendment will serve to
ensure that workers qualify to purchase houses early in their lives as
opposed to a situation where they work for many years without qualifying
for a house or a housing loan, only to take their savings at the end of
their lives when they go on pension to purchase a house.

The amendment is crafted carefully to ensure that the resources of the
pensioner are not unnecessarily eroded at the time of retirement. Only a
third of the pensioner's savings in a pension fund would be used for this
purpose. In a situation where a loanholder defaults the money will be used
to settle the loan. This will prevent the possibility of a loss of one's
house or the replacement of one's family.

It should be understood that payment from the pension fund in the case of a
default will be a matter of last resort. The board of the fund will always
find alternative ways to settle in case of a default, but in a case where
there is no other alternative the pension fund will be used in this regard.
In case of a default the fund does not have to wait for a person to reach
his pensionable age. The payment can be made whilst the pensioner is in the
employ of the company or still a member of a fund.

The arrangement proposed in this Bill is crucial for most members of the
working class, as these people do not have any savings other than their
pension. This is also to help Africans avoid costs they usually incur in
securing home loans, because they are required to get special policy
vehicles to guarantee their home loans, which increases the cost of getting
a home loan. The arrangements proposed by this Bill create a better risk
environment for financial institutions, as the risk in respect of such
loans which are backed by pension funds, will be zero.

Our society has inherited serious abnormalities. These include large income
gaps, the reluctance of financial institutions to deal with poor people and
so forth. This leaves working people very vulnerable. It is because of this
situation that our policy development approach should be geared towards the
needs of the poor and working people. Failure to do this will worsen the
condition of these vulnerable groups. We must review our statutes
continuously to create opportunities and possibilities for these vulnerable
groups.

This amendment deliberately focuses on banks and mutual banks because banks
are the institutions best equipped to deal with home loans. It also makes
provision for those pension funds which previously administered home loans
to transfer the burden of that administration to banks.

It is our belief that this Bill will create an environment whereby most
people who previously could not gain access to home loans will be gaining
access, which will mean that those people who previously could not have
houses will have their situation improved, in that they will be in a
position to get access to housing without having to rely on the state.
Therefore the ANC supports this Bill.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, this Bill aims to address three main issues.
Firstly, it authorises pension funds to furnish guarantees to third parties
in respect of housing loans, which is highly desirable because it will
widen the availability of such loans. It could reduce costs because if
pension fund members are able to find a lower rate outside, given the fact
that the bond is now guaranteed, it will assist them to get their loans
cheaper, so that pension funds themselves do not feel obliged to go into
the mortgage loan business, which is not what they are there for in the
first instance.

Secondly, it extends the concept of residential property ownership to cater
for a variety of circumstances and a variety of leaseholds, title deeds and
so on, that apply in our society. Thirdly, it extends the power of the
Minister to prevent abuse of these funds for this purpose.

We therefore believe that the Bill will achieve two important objectives.
Firstly, it will facilitate housing, and particularly housing for poorer
people and, secondly, it does not of itself erode pensions although, of
course, if the member of the pension fund defaults then it can erode the
member's pension fund, but the Bill itself does not do so. The DP will
therefore be supporting this Bill.

However, let me make one comment and ask the hon the Deputy Minister a
question, because once again we are dealing with a pension fund issue on an
ad hoc basis. About five years ago we were promised that there was going to
be a comprehensive review of retirement funding, including taxation of
retirement funds and many other aspects. There have been numerous
commissions over the past ten to 15 years on the subject and yet we still
do not have a comprehensive approach to retirement funding.

I would like to ask the Deputy Minister, who is not actually listening, the
following questions. Five years ago, even before he became chairperson of
the portfolio committee, when he was an ordinary member, he will recall
that we were promised that there was going to be a comprehensive review of
retirement funding, the taxation thereof and so on. Today we are still
waiting and we are dealing with another Bill which, despite its merits, is
still being dealt with on an ad hoc basis in relation to the preservation
of pensions and so on. I would like the hon the Deputy Minister, when he
responds, please to tell us when we are going to see that comprehensive
review. [Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, currently a registered pension fund may grant
housing loans to its members from its own members' fund. This Bill will now
allow the pension fund to provide guarantees to banks, building societies
and other financial institutions against the pledge of its members
withdrawal benefit. This will then be utilised for home loans and the
renovation of existing buildings.

The fact that funds will now be able to provide guarantees to financial
institutions for extending home loans to its members should be welcomed, as
this will undoubtedly allow more people access to housing finance. This is
particularly true for those people that are experiencing problems with
housing finance due to the banks' reticence to take on high-risk loans. A
pension fund guarantee based on the member's withdrawal benefit should
convince banks to extend housing finance to such members as it indeed takes
very few risks.

The ability to negotiate lower interest rates directly with the financial
institution will also now be possible, and that will enable more fund
members to afford a housing loan and to save on the interest part of their
repayments because, again, the banking institution would rather give a
lower interest rate to a person with such a guarantee than to a person who
has to negotiate on his own.

The fact that the guarantee will be limited to a third of the member's
ultimate withdrawal benefits should also be supported as it protects the
actuarial health of the fund and the member's retirement planning. This
would mean that the repayment of the bond should be structured in such a
way that the member should at least have two thirds of his retirement fund
free when he goes on pension.

The Bill will lead to a situation where more pension funds will be willing
to provide loan guarantees instead of administering the loans themselves,
which obviously could result in savings on administrative costs in the long
term. In all, the Bill should be applauded as an innovative method of
opening access to housing finance for people who might otherwise not have
qualified for home loans. In addition, this Bill might play a positive role
in decreasing the housing shortage in South Africa.

It may interest members that, of course, with our own pension fund for MPs
we wrote these guarantees into the rules at the time. As such, we are now
in the position that we actually ran ahead of what is happening here. I
think that all members would, indeed, subscribe to this particular aspect.
The IFP will definitely support this Bill.

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister, this is a
technical Bill which basically enables members of a pension fund to use
their fund as security for a loan from the pension fund to obtain a private
residence. This is a positive piece of legislation, because it widens the
legal definition of ownership and enables an individual, through right of
occupation, to obtain surety.

South Africa finds itself in the position of being one of the developing
economies. This piece of legislation will allow members of pension funds to
develop and attain ownership of a dwelling by right of historic occupation.
To satisfy our present housing needs, it is imperative to involve the
private sector, especially financial institutions, which will, eventually,
result in the creation of the much-needed employment opportunities in the
building, retail and manufacturing sectors of the economy.

This Bill must also be seen in the context of the decline in the cost of
mortgage finance which resulted in a resurgence in trading activity in the
real estate market and a number of gains in residential property, and the
rise of real estate share prices over the past two and a half years. This
was the trend till last Tuesday. I would like to elaborate upon this and
quote from the annual economic report of the Reserve Bank:


  Since September 1998 to June 2001 the companies in the real estate sector
  have increased by 71%; and from January 1999 to June 2001 the prices of
  building, construction and engineering went up by 104%.

However, South Africa faces a number of profound economic challenges,
namely job creation, rural development, poverty alleviation and skills
management. Access to finance is one of the factors that are hindering the
participation of a fair proportion of our population. We trust that this
particular Bill will lead to better and more employment opportunities.

The significance of this Bill is that it has the ability to increase
landownership amongst all sectors of society and will give South Africans
access to capital and land. What South Africa needs at present is an
economic growth rate of at least 7% to 8%. In order to attain this rate, we
will have to attract and encourage as many South Africans as we can to use
all of their sources of income to spur all activities. The DA supports this
particular Bill.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker and hon members, the most important feature
of this Bill is that the right of property ownership is extended to include
the right to occupy land, other than under a lease agreement. It opens new
and exciting opportunities for people in informal settlements in urban
areas and for people living on tribal land. It is good news for persons in
the lower income groups of South Africa. It is estimated that 12 000 home
loans are granted per month to people in lower income groups, 80% of such
loans being obtained through pension funds, with the average loan amounting
to R13 000.

The Bill therefore not only extends property ownership, but also expands
access to capital. This is a small step towards eventually making the
majority of South Africans the proud owners of a home or land. This may, if
implemented correctly and utilised on a wide scale, unlock billions of so-
called dead capital in our society, where people will be able to buy and
sell property through legal systems and institutions.

The UDM urges Government to utilise the opportunity to expand private
property ownership even beyond the limits envisaged in this Bill, to the
poor people of our society. Poor people may not owe much, but the home that
they will proudly occupy will represent the vast majority of their life
savings.

Another feature of this Bill is that, for the first time, a registered
pension fund may provide a guarantee to a person as security for that
person to obtain a housing loan from a bank. The bank, due to the security
of a guarantee, will be in a position to offer such applicants favourable
interest rates. A member, being granted a housing loan against a guarantee
by the pension fund, may purchase a dwelling, or land and erect a dwelling
on it, or make additions, alterations and repairs to the dwelling. A final
feature of this Bill is that property ownership may vest in a member or a
spouse or both.

In conclusion, the final test of the success of this Bill is that banks
must now comply with it. This must be measured regularly. The UDM supports
the Bill.

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, hon Ministers and members, the pension fund is
a lucrative industry with an estimated R80 billion in surplus. The question
of who holds ownership over the surplus is the issue of contention. Does
the surplus belong to the fund or the employer? This Bill aims to clarify
that issue. What this Bill aims to do is to apply treatment that is fair
and equal to all.

Companies and shareholders must be held accountable on how they manage
contributions to a pension fund. In the past, contributors to the fund had
very little to say over how the surplus must be administered. This Bill
provides equitable guidelines to ensure that the future of the pension fund
remains profitable for all.

This Bill allows pension funds to provide financial institutions with
guarantees as security for housing loans for members. This provision is
very commendable. We, therefore, as the ACDP, support this Bill
wholeheartedly.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mevrou die Speaker, die vraag is in terme van die
Wysigingswetsontwerp op Pensioene wat dit vir die man op straat beteken.
Ons het hier gehoor dat die impak en die effek van hierdie wysiging dit nou
moontlik maak dat pensioenfondse aangewend kan word om te verseker dat die
lede daarvan, 'n huisverband kan bekom by 'n finansiële instelling. Die
groot voordeel natuurlik daaraan verbonde is dat mens 'n laer rentekoers
kan beding.

Die VF wil ook vandag voorstel dat hierdie Parlement ondersoek moet instel
in terme van finansiële instellings wat goedkoop lenings kan gee teen laer
rentekoerse. Wat bedoel ek daarmee? As mens vandag 'n huis koop en jy
betaal tussen 20 en 30 jaar aan daardie huis af, betaal mens byna vyf keer
die prys van die huis. 'n Huis wat R100 000 gekos het, kos op die ou einde
byna R400 000. Ons moet ondersoek instel na finansiële instellings en kyk
of dit moontlik is dat sulke instellings verplig kan word om 'n maksimum
rentekoers in te stel vir huisverbande. [Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, the question is, in terms of the Pension
Funds Amendment Bill, what does it mean for the man in the street. We heard
here that the impact and the effect of this amendment now makes it possible
for pension funds to be utilised to ensure that their members can obtain a
home loan at a financial institution. The great advantage attached to that
of course is that one can negotiate a lower interest rate.

Today the FF also wants to propose that this Parliament should launch an
investigation in connection with financial institutions that can grant
inexpensive loans at lower interest rates. What do I mean by that? If one
buys a house today and one pays it off over between 20 and 30 years, one
pays nearly five times the price of that house. A house which cost R100 000
would eventually cost almost R400 000. We should investigate financial
institutions and see whether it is possible to compel such institutions to
introduce a maximum interest rate for home loans. [Time expired.]]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, the PAC supports the Pension Funds Amendment
Bill. Its purposes are to clarify the position regarding the power of a
registered pension fund, guarantee housing loans granted to members by
persons other than the fund and extend the concept of ownership.

The amendment to section 19(5)(a) of the Act proposes the definition of
``fair value'' instead of ``market value'' of the property for the purposes
of housing schemes. The PAC appreciates this new and appropriate language
to the stale capitalist language of ``market value'' which has the
connotation of exploiting the poor and enriching those who are already
rich.

The Bill seems to be an improvement on the Pension Funds Act of 1956. One
can only quarrel with it when it comes to gender. In many places it speaks
of ``him'' but not ``her'', or of ``he'' but not ``she''. In other cases,
as if as an afterthought, it suddenly remembers that there are ``he's'' and
``she's'' in the English language and tries to atone for this by saying:
``If he, the member, were to terminate his or her membership of the fund''.
[Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the MF finds the security of guarantee that
the Bill places on pension funds, which in turn seeks to ensure favourable
rates of interest in the offering of loans to its members, in order. This
clarification given to registered pension funds to furnish guarantees
appears favourable, and the MF recognises that the success of these funds
depends on procedures to regulate this.

The MF finds the broadening of the term ``ownership'' to allow for a
variety of circumstances and to cater for situations better, as well as the
definition given to ``fair value'', accommodating.

The MF firmly supports the regulations regarding the amount of loans and
guarantees, clearly allowing for a mechanism that the registered pension
fund must comply with, and also the extension of the Minister's powers to
make further regulations. However, what procedures are in place to ensure
that the making of such regulations by the Minister is in order?
The MF notes the accommodation that the Bill makes for correction, in case
of default, which is reassuring. The MF supports the Pension Funds
Amendment Bill.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, die algemeengeldende beginsel in die
kompeterende mark van vandag is: ``Skoenmaker, hou jou by jou lees.''
Daarom verwelkom die AEB dit dat pensioenfondse nie self nie, maar by wyse
van waarborge aan finansiële instellings,  gaan help met behuising en die
lenings daarvoor, en die sekuriteit gaan bied.

Hierdie wetgewing het baie positiewe aspekte. Dit sal 'n vryer mark tot
gevolg hê, kompetisie vir laer rentekoerse sal op hierdie wyse verhoog
word, en die subsidiëring van huiseienaars deur ander lede van die fonds
sal deur die nuwe wetgewing uitgeskakel word. Hierdie wetsontwerp behoort
ook baie te help om die sogenaamde ``red-lining'' van sekere woonbuurte vir
huislenings uit te skakel en almal te help om huiseienaarskap te kan bekom.

'n Groot gevaar in die gebruik van pensioenvoorsiening vir lenings is dat
die uiteindelike pensioen deur skuld verteer kan word. Daarom word die
beskerming van twee derdes van pensioenkapitaal teen lenings ook verwelkom.

Die AEB verwelkom die verbreding van die begrip ``huiseienaarskap'' en
steun hierdie wetgewing, en glo dat dit 'n bydrae kan lewer tot gesonde en
effektiewe finansiering vir behuising sonder om eventuele pensioeninkomste
daardeur in gevaar te stel. Ons steun die wetsontwerp.  (Translation of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, the generally applicable principle in the
competitive market today is: ``Cobbler, stick to your last.'' That is why
the AEB welcomes the fact that pension funds themselves are not going to
help with housing and loans for that purpose and offer security, but that
all this is going to take place through guarantees to financial
institutions.

This legislation has many positive aspects. It will result in a freer
market, competition for lower interest rates will be increased in this way
and subsidising of home owners by other members of the fund will be
eliminated by means of the new legislation. This Bill should also
contribute greatly to eliminating the so-called red-lining of certain
residential areas and helping everyone to attain home ownership.

A great danger in using pension money for loans is that the eventual
pension could be consumed by debt. That is why the protection of two thirds
of pension capital against loans is welcome.

The AEB welcomes the expansion of the concept ``home ownership'' and
supports this legislation, and believes that it could make a contribution
to sound and effective financing of housing, without endangering eventual
pension income in doing so. We support the legislation.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, I would like to thank all
members who have participated in this debate. I think that there is
agreement that this is a measure that will go a long way towards addressing
the critical problem of access to finance, so that people will be able to
help themselves to own their own houses.

In relation to the issue that was raised by the hon Ken Andrew, I just want
to say that the recommendations that came out of that process have not been
lost. An issue that we have sought to take into account as part of the
process, is the work of the committee which is led by the Minister of
Social Development.

There is a comprehensive process to look at our social security system in
order to identify gaps that exist. It is expected that this committee is
going to be tabling its report very shortly, I think during the course of
this year. We have taken the view that we need to take that into account as
well, as we seek to take forward the work that was done. One understands
that this is a process that has taken a bit of time, but we have taken the
view that we need to await the results of that process. Having said so,
work is continuing.

Regarding some of the more immediate issues, for example the UIF, this is
an element of our social security system. Measures have been taken recently
to stabilise the fund, but also, through improvements in the legislation,
to improve compliance and administration of the UIF. So, with regard to
some of the more immediate and pressing issues, we have taken particular
measures, while the more comprehensive process is still going on.

I would like to thank all members for supporting the Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

              FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (PROTECTION OF FUNDS) BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, in opening this debate on
the Financial Institutions Bill, it must be understood that consumer
protection and extended powers for the registrar to enforce that protection
lie at the root of this piece of legislation. The existing Financial
Institutions Act, which is being repealed and replaced by this particular
Bill, has been a most useful regulatory tool in the hands of the registrar,
as it applies to all financial institutions under the supervision of the
Financial Services Board.

In essence the Bill regulates the investment, safe custody and
administration of the funds and trust property of a principal by financial
institutions. The Financial Institutions Act is a law which the registrar
has applied in bringing about curatorships over the businesses of a large
number of institutions, notably the Masterbond group, the Owen Wiggins
group, the IGI insurance company and First Central Insurance Ltd, which was
the latest casualty.

The Bill that we are looking at today is the successor to this Financial
Institutions Act of 1964, which in turn was replaced by the Financial
Institutions Act of 1984. Scrutiny of this Bill will clearly show the
genealogical line of this legislation. While the emphasis in the two Acts
was mainly on the regulation of funds and trust property administered by
financial institutions, this Bill, while retaining that regulation, extends
into the field of enforcement powers, at the instance of the registrar.
This has proved to be a shortcoming in the two previous Acts.

In summary, the first part of the Bill that we are looking at seeks to
regulate the investment, safekeeping, custody and administration by
financial institutions of funds and trust property. The second part is
aimed at consumer protection, sought to be achieved by adequate and
effective enforcement measures granted to the regulator.
The provisions which are contained in the first part are almost a replica
of the provisions to be found in the previous two Acts I have referred to.
The important issue of the coverage by the Bill of FSB-supervised financial
institutions was raised by the portfolio committee. ``Financial
institution'' in this Bill is therefore defined as any person or
institution referred to in the definition of a financial institution in
section 1 of the Financial Services Board Act, 1990, and any medical scheme
contemplated in section 1 of the Medical Schemes Act.

Accordingly, the Bill covers the defined category of financial
institutions, including banks, that conduct trust business on behalf of
principals, as well as medical schemes. Furthermore, the Registrar of
Medical Schemes, in terms of the Medical Schemes Act, can exercise the
extended powers granted to the registrar as defined in this Bill.

The provisions of the second part of this Bill deal with enforcement
measures and apply not only to financial institutions, but also to
associated institutions and unregistered persons. Clause 5, which deals
with curatorship orders, succeeds an equivalent provision in the current
Act. The same applies to clause 6.
Clause 7 is a new clause and enables the registrar to declare certain
practices as irregular or undesirable which, although new in this Bill, is
by no means strange in regulatory laws. This is a preventative measure
aimed at the eradication of undesirable practices and consequential losses
to the public.

This Bill has been extensively consulted on, with various recommendations
having been received from groups that have taken an interest in the Bill.
Accordingly, we would recommend that the National Assembly approve this
Bill. [Applause.]

Prof B TUROK: Madam Speaker, some three years ago I received a telephone
call from somebody who wanted to remain anonymous, saying that he had
certain documents that he wanted to show me in connection with a very big
scam in this country. I was then about to visit Pretoria and this person
lodged assertive documents in the hotel that I was staying in. Because he
did not want me to identify him, I knew neither his name nor his
appearance, but the assertive documents related to the Masterbond scandal.
Most of us will remember that scandal. I was then bound to look into the
whole question of Masterbond and then there was a court case and the
culprits were put in prison for a long period of time.

Masterbond was put under curatorship in terms of the Financial Institutions
Act. That Act has as its objective the protection of the public against bad
management in financial institutions. The result has been that something
like 70 institutions are now under curatorship in terms of the very same
Act.

When the Portfolio Committee on Finance discussed this particular Bill,
certain issues came to the fore which may be of interest to the House. One
of the issues was: What is the regulatory function of Government as opposed
to the self-regulation that many people in the professions and business
constantly call for? Should we have a system whereby people regulate
themselves? Or should the Government perform a regulatory function?

What we were told in the committee was that there were rogues operating
with abandon in certain areas of the finance system. It became very clear
that we needed a strong regulatory state institution which would insist on
sound corporate governance in the private sector. People on this side of
the House are often complaining about management and governance in the
public sector. But what we learnt in the Portfolio Committee on Finance is
that we have to address the question of sound corporate governance in the
private sector. We were told - I hope some members will listen to what I am
about to say - that certain insurance brokers were contravening almost
every law, that they were not paying over money, and that they were not
accepting any risk for themselves. This is why we need a state, and a
strong state, with strong regulatory powers which is going to attend to
these rogues operating in the insurance environment and similar investment
environments.

Let us look at what self-regulation means. The Financial Services Board
told our committee that with respect to the short-term insurance industry,
self-regulation simply does not work. The Financial Services Board does not
even know how many intermediaries there are out there, operating
unregistered, unrecognised and unsupervised. So, when our committee hears
these constant appeals for self-regulation by certain professions and
industries, we become a bit sceptical because we have been told by none
other than the Financial Services Board that we must watch out because
there are rogues at work in that sector. I have no doubt that there are
many members of this House who have been caught out by sharpshooting
brokers and investment advisers who are not regulated. From now on they
will be regulated. Members should please pay attention, their money is at
risk!

Then there is the question of trust funds. We are all aware of the fact
that there are many trust funds out there in the finance industry, and that
we need to codify the way they operate. This Bill tightens up the statutory
codification of the law on trusts and it deals with some very important
principles which I think we should all bear in mind. People who deal in
trusts have a fiduciary duty when they deal with trust property and trust
funds. There are certain values in the Bill which we need to pay attention
to. People who deal in trusts are required to exercise good faith, proper
care, diligence, the declaration of private interests, and they must ensure
that the trust funds that they look after are totally separate from other
funds for which they are responsible. And if in any case there is any kind
of personal financial interest, they have to declare in writing in the
minutes of the meetings of various boards that they have those personal
interests.
I think we are all aware that in the NGO community and in the trust
industry as a whole, there is often a duplication and an overlap between
the personal interests of the people who are involved and the trust money
that they control. This Bill is intended to ensure that there is absolutely
no improper advantage for the person holding the trust funds.

In our discussions, various issues arose about the nongovernmental
organisations who also have trust funds. A financial institution was
defined as any person who or which deals with trust property as a regular
feature of his, her or its business. NGOs often have trust funds but they
do not use trust property as a regular feature of the business, which means
they do not fall directly under the Act. And yet we are aware of the fact
that there are trust funds in NGOs, and that there are NGOs which operate
as trusts. It is important that this legislation and the Financial Services
Board are concerned with these things. We have been given an assurance that
complaints will be taken up by the Financial Services Board and that
section 21 companies will also be scrutinised to a limited degree in this
respect.

Finally, let me say that there are unregistered operators in institutions
which work in the field of insurance, financial institutions and services.
These have to be monitored and caught, and this Bill will enable Government
to ensure that these crooks are brought to book. [Applause.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, the primary purpose of this Bill is to
improve the enforcement of the previous Bill in respect of financial
institutions and the funds that they handle.

I think the essence of the Bill is captured by the clause in which it is
made clear that people entrusted with other people's funds and investments
must, and I quote: ``ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. observe the utmost good faith and exercise
proper care and diligence''. Unfortunately, this has not always been so and
the case of Masterbond, which has been mentioned, is one of the most famous
in our country.

One hopes that this legislation will act as an additional deterrent and
will also empower the authorities to intervene before investors' money is
lost, and not only afterwards. The DA will be supporting this Bill, but I
would like to point out that, due to the workload that we sit with in the
Portfolio Committee on Finance, there are, in fact, some drafting or
typographical errors in the Bill as tabled, which will need to be corrected
in due course.

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, this Bill repeals and replaces the Financial
Institutions (Investment of Funds) Act. The new name will be the Financial
Institutions (Protection of Funds) Bill.

This Bill will now extend the remedies of the regulator for the sake of
protecting consumers of financial services. The importance of this Bill is
that it will not only apply to financial institutions, but also to
associated institutions and even to unregistered persons.

The Bill deals extensively with curatorships and gives them greater
clarity, and makes this function much more effective and regulatory in
nature. This is a preventative measure, aimed at the eradication of
undesirable practices and consequential losses to the public.

My colleagues have already mentioned some of these undesirable practices
that have taken place and I am not going to dwell on that any further.
Without much further ado, I am just saying that the IFP will support this
Bill.

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, hon Minister and hon Deputy Minister, this
Bill is an update to provide for the investment, safe custody and
administration of funds and trust property by financial institutions.

This Bill is significant because in the past a fair number of South
Africans have invested vast sums of money with questionable institutions
which have abused the trust the investors placed in them. The result of
this is that the state today has to provide for these unfortunate and,
regrettably, often elderly citizens, with limited disposable income. This
Bill stipulates the duties of persons dealing with funds and trust
property.

South Africa is becoming an integral part of the global economic order. An
important proviso for economic growth, however, is that the public and the
private sector must conduct all business activities in a fair and
transparent manner. The accusation is often levelled by international
investors that some businessmen in South Africa have become wealthy as a
result of their participation in insider share trading ventures.

Regrettably, in the recent past a number of executives of a well-known
institution have also unilaterally approved bonuses for themselves. When it
became public, however, they fortunately withdrew this. If this action had
taken place, it would have had a fairly negative impact upon the
shareholders of this particular institution. As some of the other speakers
have said, the same principle regarding fairness and transparency also
applies to the public sector. Nobody is above the law.

The very controversial arms procurement deal, our spiralling crime rate and
allegations of corruption that relate to a number of public office bearers,
constitute a serious threat to our socioeconomic wellbeing, in the sense
that we need direct foreign investment and, whether we like it or not,
corruption is a deterrent to direct foreign investment. The only way of
reducing our alarmingly high rate of unemployment is to attract foreign
investors to create economic wealth in this country.

Chapter 2 of this Bill provides for more effective enforcement measures and
oversight by the Financial Services Board. What is significant, however, is
that any director, member or agent of a financial institution will have to
declare their interest in writing regarding all their activities, and if
they take particular actions which may impede the wellbeing of that
particular business.

Furthermore, the powers of enforcement and of the registrar are very
clearly defined in this particular Bill. It is also welcomed that any
person who fails to comply with any provision of this Act is guilty of an
offence and is liable to a monetary fine or imprisonment.

The DA supports this Bill. The Bill will force financial institutions to
manage their business in a responsible and equitable manner, and create a
business culture where the rights of all stakeholders are respected and
protected, not abused.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker and hon members, this Bill may seem to be
simple in format and content, but it has wide-ranging implications for
financial institutions and persons not currently regulated in terms of
legislation. By adopting this Bill today, institutions and persons who are
operating outside the regulatory net will now be brought into this net and
should therefore be supported.

Many of us will still recall the sagas surrounding Masterbond and Supreme
Holdings, which managed to slip through the net of regulations, with
devastating effects for investors who lost millions of rands in precious
savings. This type of activity, where transgressors are unregistered
insurers, unregistered investment managers or questionable institutions
whose activities resemble those of financial institutions, all of whom are
operating outside the net, should be stopped. It will happen with the
passing of this Bill, providing a greater amount of protection for
customers of financial institutions.

The sting in this Bill lies in the extension of powers to the registrar,
making it possible for him or her to establish a curatorship over so-called
associated institutions and/or unregistered institutions. The registrar has
further powers to call for specified information, to apply to a court for
an order restraining the conduct of business and to publish names in shame.

The powers granted in this Bill to curators and regulators therefore
attempt to pre-empt foul play by dishonest operators, thereby eradicating
undesirable practices and consequential losses to the public. The registrar
may achieve this by declaring certain practices irregular or undesirable.

Persons found guilty of an offence in terms of this Bill may be liable to a
fine or imprisonment for a period of up to 15 years, forfeit any profit
made in the process, compensate the institution for damage suffered and
jeopardise a future career in any financial institution.

We think this is a good Bill, and the UDM will support it.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! As I call upon the next hon member, may I ask
hon members please to lower their voices as they talk to each other? Some
of you are conducting your conversations so loudly that I can even hear
what you are saying.

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, hon Ministers and members, the Masterbond saga
remains one of South Africa's great fraudulent schemes that must never be
repeated. It is our view that this Bill successfully regulates control over
such occurrences, and we are sure that such an occurrence will never happen
again in the history of South Africa.

Since South Africa's integration into the international market, many
challenges have been expected, and we must continue to provide a secure
financial haven for both local and foreign investment initiatives. In this
regard, strengthening our regulation of and control over the financial
sector will assist with the strengthening of our domestic economy.

The powers and functions of the registrar become vital in this regard and
we therefore commend the Ministry for taking the proper precautions. The
powers of the registrar, which are spelled out in clause 6 of this Bill,
send a very clear message to would-be investors and therefore the ACDP
supports this Bill.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mevrou die Speaker, dit is omtrent daagliks dat 'n mens
'n koerant oopmaak en waar 'n mens lees van groot skandale in terme van
finansies, van die publiek wat hul laaste pensioengeldjies of beleggings
gaan belê by 'n finansiële instelling om dan aan die einde van die dag uit
te vind dat hulle geld eintlik weggeraak het.

'n Goeie voorbeeld is van die oud-weermaggeneraals wat ook deel was van die
finansiële instelling waar hulle miljoene rande verloor het. Daar is van
hierdie mense wat nou moet gaan koeksisters bak en op straat verkoop. Die
VF verwelkom hierdie wysigingswetsontwerp, omdat dit 'n poging is om juis
die weerlose publiek daar buite te probeer beskerm om nie slagoffers te
word van swendelaars wat hul misbruik nie. Die VF glo nie dat mens dit ooit
honderd persent kan stop nie, maar hier is minstens 'n poging en die VF
verwelkom dit. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, almost every day when one opens a
newspaper, one reads about big financial scandals, about the public
investing their last bit of pension money or investments with a financial
institution, only to find at the end of the day that their money has
actually disappeared.

A good example is that of the former Defence Force generals who were also
part of the financial institution where they lost millions of rands. Some
of these people now have to make koeksisters and sell them in the street.
The FF welcomes this amending Bill because it is an attempt to protect the
vulnerable public outside from becoming victims of fraudsters who take
advantage of them. The FF does not believe that one could ever stop this
totally, but this is at least an attempt, and the FF welcomes it.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the MF notes that this Bill was taken back
by its promoters in 1999, to accommodate other clauses to ensure the
efficient and effective protection of consumers of financial services. It
is important and reassuring for a consumer of financial services to be
protected in his or her financial practices.

It not only instils confidence in the system, but also senses
professionalism in maintaining confidentiality. The Bill sets out to
provide for and consolidate laws relating to the investment, safe custody
and administration of funds and trust property by financial institutions
and to enable the registrar to protect such funds and trust property. The
MF applauds the department on its improvements to the Bill and appreciates
the Bill's accommodation of clarity, explanation and definition of powers
and process which will in turn ensure the proper activation of its clauses
and aims. The MF supports the Financial Institutions (Protection of Funds)
Bill.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, menige hartseer verhaal kan vertel word
van Jan Burger wat 'n finansiële instelling of kwasi-instelling blindelings
vertrou het, meestal met sy pensioengeld of sy swaarverdiende neseier en
dan kaal uitgestap het. Hierdie wetsontwerp sterk die kontrole oor
finansiële instellings om eerlike, bo-die-tafel besigheid te doen. Sodoende
beskerm die wet die individu teen korporatiewe uitbuiting.

Daar is natuurlik die vraag na balans en of staatsregulering gewens sou
wees. Iewers in die Bybel staan mos dat dit my vrystaan om met my eie goed
te maak wat ek wil. Feit is, hierdie is egter nie eiegoed nie. Dit is
fondse van die publiek en om dit oneerlik of onder 'n swendelary aan te
wend, is eintlik 'n kriminele saak en daarom kom die staat ten volle in die
spel. Die AEB ondersteun hierdie wetgewing en ons vertrou dat dit ook
weldra uitgebrei kan word na ander dienste wat gelewer word waar die
publiek sonder skroom misbruik word. (Translation of Afrikaans speech
follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, many a sad story could be told about John
Citizen who blindly trusted a financial or quasi-financial institution,
mostly with his pension money or his hard-earned nest egg and then lost
everything. This Bill strengthen the control over financial institutions to
conduct honest above-board business. Thus the law protects the individual
against corporate exploitation.

There is of course the question of balance and whether state regulation
would be advisable. Somewhere in the Bible it is, after all, stated that it
is up to me what I want to do with my own possessions. But the fact of the
matter is, these are not own possessions. These are the funds of the public
and to apply them dishonestly or fraudulently is actually criminal and
therefore the state becomes a full-fledged player in the game. The AEB
supports this legislation and we trust that it will soon be extended to
other services that are delivered where the public is summarily exploited.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, once more I would like to
thank members who have participated in the debate and supported the Bill. I
do think that from the issues that have been raised by members, there are
issues that one needs to pick up and make a few comments on.

In the interventions of a number of members, the issue of the Masterbond
scandal came up. And I would basically like to say that it is my
understanding that the final report of the Nel Commission on the Masterbond
scandal has been tabled with the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
Development. One of the things that we look forward to is that, out of
that, a comprehensive process can evolve that will see us as a country
dealing with a lot of issues that have been thrown up by the Masterbond
scandal. Quite clearly, one of the central issues that we shall have to
deal with is the issue of the role, the accountability and the liability of
the accounting profession. The accounting profession came out very
strongly, as having been one of the major failures in the Masterbond group.
I just thought that I should made that point.

Secondly, on the issue of regulation by Government, vis-à-vis self-
regulation, we are, of course, dealing with this issue on an ongoing basis,
because in the environment in which we operate today, where we are opening
up our own environment for participation by other companies from other
countries, we do not expose our people to swindling and abuse by companies
that originate from elsewhere. And so do the issues around regulation and
tightening, while ensuring that we are still able to compete effectively in
the global environment. And I think that these are some of the issues in
the context of the announcement that was made by the Minister earlier this
year, that we shall be moving towards a single regulator.

These are the issues that we shall have to deal with in that context,
because, certainly, if we are moving in that direction, we shall have to
look at issues of capacity, because today we has the scale and the size of
organisations or companies and the scale and size of transactions that
exist. They do warrant that credible capacity is in place to be able to
regulate? One have conglomerates that offer a whole range of services -
banking services, asset management services and insurance services. They
operate globally. How does one make sure that such companies are properly
regulated. These are issues that we shall have to deal with in the context
of the policy announcement by the Minister earlier in the year.

On the issue of abuses by brokers, financial advisors and intermediaries, I
would like to draw attention to the fact that in the course of last year,
we put in place two sets of policy holder protection rules. These relate to
the short-term and the long-term insurance Acts. We put these rules in
place, whilst at the same time we were working on a comprehensive piece of
legislation, which will shortly be debated in this Parliament. This is the
Financial Advisory and Intermediaries Services Bill. It seeks to
comprehensively regulate the functioning and the accountability of the
financial advisors and financial intermediaries. So, this is something that
Parliament will have an opportunity to deal with comprehensively.

Finally, I should make the point that, clearly South Africa has to be
shaken out of complacency in terms of issues of regulation, ensuring that
there is effective regulation, but also ensuring that there is effective
consumer education and effective consumer protection. But, we should also
give a voice to consumer groups. I think this is a culture that has not
fully taken hold in South Africa. And I think that if we are to achieve our
objectives of ensuring that we have sound institutions and that the
interests of consumers are protected, we shall have to deal with these
things. We shall be seeing a number of laws that turn out to be more
comprehensive in their coverage and scope, such as the collective
investment schemes, security services legislation and so on. I would like
to thank members for supporting this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                   PROVINCIAL TAX REGULATION PROCESS BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, this Bill empowers provinces to
take another important step forward in exercising their constitutional
powers and give effect to the vision of a unitary but fiscally
decentralised system of government. This Bill is required not only for
constitutional reasons, but for sound fiscal and governance reasons.

I want to focus for a moment on the constitutional - legal aspects. If I
may retrace our steps in this regard, about five years ago we gathered in
the Constitutional Assembly as freely elected representatives of our
people, to work out a scheme of Government best suited to the people of our
democratic Republic. Conscious of the divisions, inequalities and unfair
discrimination from which we emerged, we adopted as a supreme law of our
Republic a magnificent Constitution so as to amongst others, ``build a
united and democratic South Africa able to take its rightful place as a
sovereign state in the family of nations.''

We devised for this single sovereign and democratic state a Government
constituted as ``national, provincial and local spheres of government which
are distinctive, interdependent and interrelated.'' To ensure these three
features - which are the distinctiveness, interdependence and interrelation
- could in practice be real, we set out principles of co-operative
government and intergovernmental relations within which each of these
spheres, and the organs of state within them, would have to function.

These principles of co-operative government and intergovernmental relations
require that each sphere of government and its organs of state should
``respect the constitutional status, institutions, powers and functions of
government in the other spheres.'' It should ``not assume any power or
functions except those conferred on them in terms of the Constitution.''
Thirdly, they should ``exercise their powers and perform their functions in
a manner that does not encroach on the geographical, functional or
institutional integrity of government in another sphere'' and co-operate
with one another in mutual trust and good faith by, amongst others,
fostering friendly relations and co-ordinating their actions and
legislation with one another.

Mr T D LEE: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER: If this debate is too complex for Mr Lee, why does he not go
outside to have a smoke?

In giving effect to this vision, Chapter 13 of the Constitution required
national Government to table and pass several pieces of legislation. Much
of this has been achieved, as demonstrated by the Intergovernmental Fiscal
Relations Act, which we passed in 1997, the Financial and Fiscal Commission
Act of the same year, the Public Finance Management Act of 1999, the
Borrowing Powers of Provincial Government Act of 1996 and four Division of
Revenue Acts which we have passed to date. This Bill is the last piece of
intergovernmental fiscal legislation applying to provinces and required by
the Constitution. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Could someone please find out where that
cellphone is? Or has someone poured water into the system? [Interjections.]

The MINISTER: Through the Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Act of 1997,
the nine MECs of finance and I have developed a great team spirit, as we
seek to translate these fine constitutional principles into practice.
Hence, the Budget Council, which will be meeting in this city two days,
indeed, promotes and facilitates intergovernmental relations in a manner
few ever contemplated.

On the constitutional and legal front, we have completed all the enabling
legislation necessary to support our provincial fiscal framework. Now I
want to point out the fiscal and economic rationale for the Bill as it
stands before us.

The economic arguments for devolving some taxation powers to subnational
governments are generally accepted in highly developed countries. They
revolve around the need to promote fiscal accountability of governments to
the electorate. The theory that supports decentralisation of taxation
authority is the idea that revenue sources match expenditure
responsibilities. Although there is consensus on this guiding principle,
this seldom occurs in practice and taxation powers vary widely. For
example, ratios of own revenues to total revenues range from around 4% in
Italy to 80% in the USA and Canada. To bridge their remaining imbalances,
most countries combine authority for own revenue sources with transfers
from national governments.

Although the conventional arguments may apply less so in a developing
country, as other factors such as the redistribution between and within
provinces must be taken into account, the economic arguments also apply, if
only on the margin. In South Africa, given our revenue-sharing model, we
are at a lower end with regard to provincial taxation powers. Our
provincial total revenues this year are budgeted at about R121 billion,
with less than 4% of that total coming from own revenues, mainly motor
vehicle licences, hospital fees and gambling proceeds.
Before focusing on our approach to provincial taxation, we must take into
account other fiscal arrangements, particularly those related to grants.
The system of equitable share and conditional grants was first implemented
in 1998 after considering the recommendations of the FFC for the previous
two years. This system is both transparent and fair. Further, provinces
have also developed their capacity to manage and spend these funds in a
responsible manner, proving that they are now ready to exercise their
taxation powers more effectively.

The FFC first raised the issue of provincial taxes in reports in 1996 and
1997. Thereafter, at the request of the Budget Council, the Katz commission
investigated provincial tax options. However, considering that South Africa
is a unitary rather than federal system and given the phase of our
evolution as a Government, the commission recommended caution in assigning
significant revenue sources to provinces. Devolved taxes will allow
provincial governments to differentiate the level of services they offer
and to be held accountable for the overall level of expenditure, instead of
only for the efficient allocation of a fixed total.

The Bill before this House is a cautious step in the assignment of revenue
sources to provinces. The executive representatives of the different
provinces who sit on the Budget Council have subjected it to scrutiny and
debate. I am most indebted to them and to the hon members of the Portfolio
Committee on Finance for their collective wisdom. They have ensured that
this Bill, in the fulfilment of the requirements of section 228(2)(b) of
the Constitution, advances co-operative government.

As set out in the long title of the Bill, its purpose is to regulate an
intergovernmental process that must be followed by provinces in the
exercise of their powers in terms of section 228 of the Constitution to
impose taxes, levies, duties and flat-rate surcharges on the tax base of
any tax, levy or duty imposed by national legislation and to provide for
matters connected therewith.

The Provincial Tax Regulation Process Bill of 2001 provides for a process
driven and directed by two fundamental principles. Firstly, that the
provinces' power to impose a provincial tax must not be exercised in a ``a
way that materially and unreasonably prejudices national economic policies,
economic activities across provincial boundaries or the national mobility
of goods, services, capital or labour''. Secondly, compliance with the
principles of co-operative government set out in Chapter 3 of the
Constitution, and which I have alluded to above.

The process set out in this Bill itself is aimed at assisting provinces to
ensure their taxation powers are exercised within the limits of the
Constitution. It provides, in the event of a dispute between a province and
national Government about compliance with constitutional requirements, for
referral to the Constitutional Court for its determination whether or not a
proposed tax is constitutional.

As indicated earlier, this Bill partially fulfils the requirements of
section 228(2)(b) of the Constitution. To ensure compliance with the
requirements of this section, it contemplates that Parliament enact further
legislation. This further legislation will - in respect of a provincial tax
proposal that does not materially and unreasonably prejudice national
economic policies, which includes the tax policies of the Republic,
economic activities across provincial boundaries and the national mobility
of goods, services, capital or labour - determine the tax base within which
such provincial tax may be levied.

The two-phase regulatory process takes into account the dual qualification
provided for in the specific and guaranteed taxing power of the provinces,
namely that the provincial taxing power should not prejudice national
policies and that the provincial taxing power must be regulated by an Act
of Parliament. The thrust of section 228 of the Constitution is accordingly
simple. It vests the circumscribed taxing power in provinces. The exercise
of such power, however, may not be used to trench upon national economic
policies and related matters. Such an exercise must also be regulated by an
Act of Parliament.

The Bill's approach is practical and it is constitutional. The Bill also
takes account of those who are paid by the word and twice for a verb, whom
my learned friends have been quick to remind me of, and that the
Constitutional Court, when giving positive certification to what we had
crafted regarding the provinces' taxing powers, an ex parte chairperson of
the Constitutional Assembly held that the term ``regulate'' in section
228(2)(b) connotes a broad managing or controlling rather than a direct
authorisation function. Such broad managing, in the words of the
Constitutional Court, serves to ensure coherence in the taxing system.
Regulation is, according to the Constitutional Court, therefore aimed at
directing and commanding that which has been authorised to be regulated.

I place this Bill before the House. I am saying that it has been duly
considered. It has been debated with our colleagues in the provincial
governments, those responsible for fiscal matters, and I trust that it will
enjoy the support of this entire House. [Applause.]

Ms B A HOGAN: Madam Speaker, the Provincial Tax Regulation Process Bill is
a pioneer Bill in the sense that it is one of the Bills which arise out of
the requirements of the Constitution and is therefore untested
constitutionally.

The committee was faced with an invidious position when we received this
Bill, because it was accompanied, already, by two legal opinions, one of
which said that the Bill was constitutional and the other saying that it
was not. We had to make a decision. The problems accompanying the
differences in the legal opinions which we received was compounded by the
fact that the opinions that we received were based on a prior version of
the Bill, not the one placed before us. We were therefore placed at even
more of a disadvantage to judge the merits of the opinions placed before
us.

This committee then asked for a further opinion based on the Bill before
us, and that opinion satisfied most committee members that we could go
forward on this Bill. In fact, as the ANC we are very much convinced that
this Bill is what is envisaged in the Constitution.

There are matters, which we looked at, that form the core of the
constitutional issues related to this Bill: The first one relates to the
question whether this Bill regulates a province's powers to impose a tax or
whether it permits a province to authorise a particular tax. In our
understanding of this Bill it definitely regulates that power and does not
permit. Certainly, we made certain amendments, which made that very
unambiguous, that a province is not permitted by the national Minister to
impose a tax, but that the exercise of that power is regulated by the
Minister.

The second issue which arose as a constitutional issue was the question
which relates to whether one Act was envisaged by the Constitution or
whether we could have a series of Acts regulating each individual tax, on
other words, a tax-by-tax series of laws. The issue is that a single
regulatory Bill cannot conceivably cover every form of taxation that a
province is entitled to impose and therefore a battery of Bills are
envisaged on a tax-by-tax basis, whereby each taxing power of a province
will be regulated. That, in terms of the legal opinion that we have before
us, is constitutional and we are of the opinion that we should move ahead
to the NCOP to hear further debate on this issue. But, certainly, it makes
sense and there is a lot of merit in the argument that no single tax Bill
can regulate all the taxes before us.

Another constitutional issue that arose before us was the question of
whether the Minister has a right to exercise his or her mind on the
constitutionality of a particular tax that comes before him or her, as
proposed by a province. It is absolutely clear that a Minister must
exercise his or her mind. The Minister is enjoined by the Constitution to
ensure that a Bill that comes before him or her meets certain conditions as
set out in the Constitution.

However, we have said in the Bill that if, in the last instance, after the
Minister has referred this Bill back to the province for re-examination,
the Minister is still of the opinion that it might not pass constitutional
muster, that Minister can refer the particular tax to the Constitutional
Court for a further judgment on this issue. It is quite clear in the
Constitution that this is what is the envisaged role of the Constitutional
Court.

Finally, with regard to the issues of co-operative governance, the powers
of a province to unilaterally impose the taxes that are granted them in
terms of this Constitution are quite clear. However, that has to be
balanced against the clauses in the Constitution which enjoin all spheres
of Government to operate on principles of a co-operative basis. And this
particular Bill which is before us at the moment is one that is
specifically directed towards spelling out what the procedures would be to
ensure that this Bill gives an outline of what procedures provinces must
undergo so as to ensure that they are co-operating with other provinces and
institutions in the manner envisaged by the Constitution.

Therefore, a process is set out in the Bill which includes that a province
wishing to impose a tax has to make those proposals to the Minister. That
province has to do its homework. It has to ensure that it understands how
that tax is going to affect people in that province. It has to ensure that
other provinces are consulted. It has to give some idea of the revenue that
is going to be garnered by this tax. In other words, a province has to
demonstrate that it has applied its mind to the implementation of such a
tax.

Once a province has done that, the Minister refers discussion on this
particular tax to a budget council, and that is where co-operative
governance really finds its feet. It is debated and discussed there, as
well as recommendations that come from the Financial and Fiscal Commission.
Once that debate is taking place, if the Minister is assured, on reasonable
grounds, that this particular tax does not interfere with the national
economic policies of the country and other constitutional requirements, the
Minister can then table a Bill legislating this form of tax into existence.

If the Minister is not of the opinion that this Bill is constitutional, the
Minister can refer it back to the MEC for further consideration. If, after
that consideration, the Minister is satisfied that his concerns have been
addressed, the process can go ahead. If, however, he is not of the opinion
that his concerns have been addressed or if there are still lingering
doubts, this proposal can be referred to the Constitutional Court for
further adjudication.

It is quite clear that this Bill deals with a regulatory process that
provinces will have to undergo in order to meet the requirements of co-
operative governance. The real test will come when one has the battery of
Bills that will come before this House, regulating each tax as envisaged by
each province.

We spent a considerable amount of time in the committee debating each
clause of the Bill backwards and forwards. The majority of members of this
committee are of the opinion that this Bill does, indeed, meet the
constitutional requirements set out in the Constitution, and we would now
want to see this Bill going to the NCOP, where the provinces have to go
through the extended mandating process.

We believe that this process will further enrich deliberation on this Bill
when we hear the voice of each province coming forward, which we in our
committee have not yet had the benefit to hear. So we look forward to the
debates in the NCOP because we certainly believe that that House will
further bring light and further enrich this Bill. The ANC supports this
Bill. [Applause.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, I would first like to address myself to some
of the process problems that we had with this Bill. They also relate to the
workload of the Portfolio Committee on Finance and its ability to give the
attention needed to all the Bills that come to it.

As a committee, we were trying to accommodate the NCOP cycle and get the
Bill to be dealt with, but that caused a number of problems. The result was
that, for example, last Friday the committee met to adopt the Bill, but it
was required to adopt the Bill which was only handed out at the committee
meeting, and the members had had no time to look at the Bill in the version
that was before them. The three-day rule was dispensed with by the Whips so
that we could debate it today, which is one or two working days after it
was adopted by the committee.

The final Bill that we are actually debating, as tabled in Parliament, was
only handed out at the Portfolio Committee on Finance meeting this morning,
again, during the meeting. In each of these stages there were, in fact,
numerous changes in the Bill. So, it was not as if it was simply a case of
printing something that one already had. We had changes all along the way.
I believe that this is simply not acceptable as it puts all members, not
only opposition members, but all members of the committee, in the invidious
position of trying to do justice to legislation which they have not had the
time to study in detail.

I have great understanding for and sympathy with the chairperson who goes
out of her way to allow all opinions to be expressed and debated, and for
the legislation to be considered properly. But, at the same time, she has
the unenviable task of trying to arrange a committee programme to cope with
an unmanageable workload.
The Constitution, in section 228, grants the power to impose certain taxes
to provinces, and it requires Parliament to regulate that power by way of
legislation. The reality is that provinces, for the foreseeable future,
will receive the majority of their funds by way of their equitable shares
from the national Budget. But that does not mean that their limited taxing
powers are unimportant. On the contrary, governments, in all spheres, are
more careful with, and accountable for, expenditure when they are obliged
to justify to the public the taxes which they have imposed.

We also need to bear in mind that the issue of appropriate constitutional
powers and responsibilities is as important as achieving taxation
efficiency. Although taxation efficiency is not in any way irrelevant, we
should not exaggerate the desirability of standardised taxation across
provinces. In fact, some variations and experimentation can be very helpful
in assessing the pros and cons of different taxes.

The challenge facing us is to achieve the correct balance between the
provinces' powers to impose some taxes and Parliament's obligation to
regulate the exercise of that power in the letter and spirit of the
Constitution. The hon chairperson of the committee has indicated various
things, but I would also like to put on record that the Treasury has agreed
to submit this Bill for further legal opinion from senior counsel before
the NCOP is required to make a decision on it.

The hon the Minister and the hon chairperson of the committee have outlined
much of the Bill and I am not going to go through the same detail. But what
is critical is when one gets to the point of the earlier processes when the
Minister decides whether, in his opinion, the proposal is constitutional or
not; and if so, he introduces a regulating Act, and if he does not think it
is constitutional he refers it back to the MEC for reconsideration. The
proposal for the new tax is then reconsidered by the MEC who returns it to
the Minister in its original or amended form; the Minister then tables the
Bill in Parliament or refers it to the Constitutional Court for a ruling.

The problem with this Bill is that it tilts the balance unduly and perhaps
even unconstitutionally away from the intention of the Constitution to
grant provinces certain taxation powers. For example, there is no limit on
the time that the Minister may take when considering the proposal and the
comments received. Secondly, even after the Minister has decided to
introduce a Bill, the Minister, in agreement with the Budget Council, not
necessarily with the agreement of the MEC concerned, can delay the
introduction of the Bill beyond the 90-day time limit imposed by the Bill
that we are considering today. Thirdly, the Bill itself may not permit the
tax base or the desired tax rate contained in the original provincial tax
proposal, even though the Minister has already satisfied himself or herself
that the original proposal and I quote `` will not be in breach of section
228(2)(a) of the Constitution.''

These provisions are an unreasonable intrusion into the powers granted to
provinces by the Constitution. All sorts of unconvincing rationalisations
have been given for this, but the real reason, I suspect, is that the
Minister, understandably, has no confidence in the ability of most of the
provincial governments that are controlled by the ANC to manage their
financial affairs responsibly.

However, that is no reason to unduly limit the powers of provinces capable
of managing their own financial affairs. The DA will not be supporting this
Bill.

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, the Constitution of the Republic empowers
provinces to impose certain taxes, levies and duties, excluding income tax,
VAT, general sales tax, rates on properties, and customs duties. Even
though it took five years to bring this framework Bill before Parliament,
it should be supported in that it finally creates a framework for
provincial governments to levy certain taxes.

This certainty has long been lacking in the financial relationship between
national and provincial government. Now, at least, there will be coherence
of the tax system on a national and a provincial basis. The fact that this
Bill establishes an extensive consultative framework should be applauded.
It is in the national economic interest that provincial tax intentions
should not be at odds with Government's macroeconomic policy, but the vice
versa also applies in this case.

While, at the same time, providing provinces with some leeway in the
collection of revenue, the IFP, as the doyen of federalism, of course,
would have gone much further in terms of this taxation. We would have done
it the constitutional way if it had depended on the IFP. Nevertheless, we
support this Bill, because it is a move in the right direction in giving
more powers to provinces and is in line with our policy.

Of course, the hon Andrew has referred to certain grey areas, the
constitutionality and those particular aspects, but we believe that this
should be dealt with at a time when it is applicable. Let us hear out the
constitutional realities on this but until such time for that matter, let
us support this Bill. [Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon members, the aim of this
Bill is to regulate the intergovernmental process that must be followed by
provinces in exercising their powers in terms of section 228 of the
Constitution, and to impose taxes, levies and duties, and the flat-rate
surcharges on the tax bases of any tax, levy or duties imposed by national
legislation.

This is, again, a technical Bill and the Portfolio Committee on Finance
initially received two legal opinions regarding the constitutionality of
this Bill. An amended legal opinion was also given when the Bill was
amended, which stated, as the chairperson has said, that this particular
Bill was constitutional. My considered opinion is that this is fairly
questionable. Whether it is constitutional or not, I welcome the decision
by the Treasury that they will ask for another legal opinion to analyse and
evaluate the provisions to see whether they really correspond with the
Constitution.

Madam Speaker, allow me to thank the chairperson of the Committee on
Finance, Ms Barbara Hogan, for the thorough and impartial way in which she
conducted the meetings and hearings regarding this particular Bill. This
Bill needs very, very thorough scrutiny, because some of the subclauses are
inconsistent with regard to the powers of the MEC and the Minister, and the
period the Minister has to respond, regarding the Constitution, to the
various provinces.

This Bill states that the SARS is responsible, as the collecting agent, for
provincial taxes, unless another agent is designated. As a South African, I
think what is very important regarding this Bill is that we will have to
review the tax burden placed upon millions of South Africans. I believe
that there is room and place for every sphere of government, but we will
have to ask other questions, whether we can carry on unilaterally levying
taxes and rates upon people when we often do not think in terms of value
for money. By levying taxes and rates, we do not always solve problems. I
think what is very important is that we have reached a crossroads regarding
taxes and levies. This, again, is something which must be considered in its
full context.

The National Council of Provinces will really have to evaluate and analyse
this Bill. We found ourselves at a crossroads, as the hon the Minister has
said, with regard to our Constitution. But the real fact about this is that
there is a discrepancy regarding the income, the degree of development and
scholastic standards within these respective provinces. It is very
important to see, if this particular Bill is implemented, how it will
affect the socioeconomic status in each of the provinces.

Again, as some other speakers have said here, this Bill seeks to foster the
autonomy of provinces, but I am not sure whether it may not negatively
impact upon that autonomy. Therefore the DA will not support this Bill.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Mev die Speaker, agb lede, hierdie wetsontwerp word
oorweeg terwyl die Ouditeur-generaal bevind het, na aanleiding van 'n oudit
van vyf provinsies gedurende 1999-2000, dat daar provinsies is wat nie al
hul bestaande inkomste ingesamel het nie. Tasbare voorbeelde word in die
verslag genoem. Tensy provinsies hierdie swak plekke uitskakel en
finansiële bestuurstelsels opskerp, gaan die aansoek om 'n nuwe provinsiale
belasting te hef koste-oneffektief wees.

Ons voorbehoud met die wetsontwerp is dat dit nie die totale las van die
Suid-Afrikaanse belastingbetaler mag verhoog nie. Terselfdertyd moet die
belastingstelsel nie meer gekompliseerd gemaak word nie. Daar moet verder
nie toegelaat word dat die administratiewe las op besighede verder verhoog
nie, met spesifieke verwysing na klein sakeondernemings.

Daar word beraam dat die nasionale Regering se belastinginkomste reeds byna
25% van die bruto binnelandse produk bedra, wat hoog is in vergelyking met
Japan se 19% en die VSA se 21%. In die toepassing van hierdie wetsontwerp
sal die sentrale Regering dus 'n fyn balans moet handhaaf. Aan die een kant
kan nie toegelaat word dat die belasting-inkomste verhouding tot BBP
verhoog word nie. Enige nuwe provinsiale belasting moet dus eers baie
sorgvuldig oorweeg word. Aan die ander kant is daar 'n verbintenis tot die
devolusie van mag, ook belastingmagte, na provinsies en plaaslike owerhede.
Dit is vanselfsprekend dat hierdie devolusie van mag gepaard sal gaan met
beter regering en 'n verbetering in dienslewering. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker, hon members, this Bill is being considered
while the Auditor-General has found, after an audit of five provinces
during 1999-2000, that there are provinces which have not collected all
their existing revenue. Concrete examples are mentioned in the report.
Unless provinces eradicate these weaknesses and improve financial
management systems, the application to levy a new provincial tax is not
going to be cost-effective.

Our reservation about the Bill is that it should not increase the total
burden of the South African taxpayer. At the same time, the tax system
should not become more complicated. Furthermore, the administrative burden
on companies should not be allowed to increase, with specific reference to
small businesses.

It is estimated that the national Government's tax revenue already
constitutes nearly 25% of the gross domestic product, which is high in
comparison with Japan's 19% and the USA's 21%. In the implementation of
this Bill central Government will thus have to maintain a delicate balance.
On the one hand, the tax revenue relationship to GDP cannot be allowed to
increase. Any new provincial tax must therefore first be considered very
carefully. On the other hand, there is a commitment to the devolution of
power, including power with regard to taxation, to provinces and local
authorities. Naturally this devolution of power will be associated with
better government and an improvement in service delivery.]

The introduction of new taxes must go hand in hand with improved service
delivery. We hope that provinces will get their act together,
administratively and financially, before they propose a new tax. Each
provincial tax structure should also take account of the revenue assigned
to the local government sphere, as was recommended by the Financial and
Fiscal Commission.

The UDM will not oppose a constitutional provision that allows an Act of
Parliament to regulate powers of provinces and to regulate the process, and
also gives practical effect to one of the most important chapters in our
Constitution, namely that of co-operative governance.

We now need common sense and cool heads in all spheres of government to
implement this Bill in a responsible manner. We will support the Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the MF notes the authority that the
Constitution of the Republic gives provincial legislatures, in section
228(1)(a), that it may impose taxes, levies and duties other than income
tax, value-added tax, rates on property or custom duties. The MF respects
the authority that the Constitution places in the hands of provincial
legislatures.

However, the MF agrees that, to ensure the proper utilisation and
efficiency of this power, a system of regulation is needed. This will also
allow for transparency and a system of checks and balances. The MF
acknowledges the regulation and procedures the Bill stipulates in respect
of provincial legislation concerning the power to impose tax on certain
sectors. The MF realises the pressure involved in imposing taxes and feels
that the period of application, working through the Minister, and the
clarification and control that the Bill inculcates, are in order. These
provisions should not be seen as a curtailing of provincial legislative
powers, but rather as a regulatory system ensuring correct implementation.

The MF supports the Provincial Tax Regulation Process Bill.

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, the underlying principle of this Bill is that
of co-operative government. The Constitution gives us the framework for co-
operative government. This Bill regulates the intergovernmental process to
be followed by provinces in the exercise of their power, in terms of
section 228 of the Constitution, to impose taxes and certain charges.

In 'n sekere sin is hierdie wetsontwerp bloot 'n konkretisering van wat
reeds in die Grondwet staan. Persoonlik kon ek nie juis iets vind wat nie
in beginsel reeds in die Grondwet vervat is nie. Daar kan besware wees teen
oorregulering, dat daar te veel beslommernis kan inkom, en ook oor die lang
tydsverloop vir 'n provinsie om dan so 'n bepaalde belasting deurgevoer te
kry. Aan die ander kant moet dit verwelkom word dat as 'n bepaalde
belasting een maal goedgekeur is, dit dan ook vir ander provinsies moontlik
sal wees. Met ander woorde, as hulle in die Noordelike Provinsie
hondebelasting ingestel het, kan die Wes-Kaap dit ook doen. So behoort dit
die saak te steun.

Die AEB steun die beginsel van federalisme, die afwenteling van gesag, ook
van die bevoegdheid van provinsies om belasting te hef, maar ons kan ook
nie dat provinsies nou lukraak belastings hef, tensy ons nie die totale
belastingopset hersien nie, ook dié van die sentrale Regering. Binne die
huidige sentrale belastingraamwerk glo ons dat hierdie wetgewing voldoende
is, en sal ons hierdie wetsontwerp steun. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[In a certain sense this Bill is simply putting into concrete terms what is
already contained in the Constitution. I personally could not find anything
that is not already in principle included in the Constitution. There may be
objections to overregulation, there being too much red tape, and then also
to the long period of time involved in provinces passing such a tax. On the
other hand it must be welcomed that once a tax has been approved, it would
also be possible to introduce the same tax in other provinces. In other
words, if they introduced dog tax in the Northern Province, the Western
Cape could do the same. The matter should therefore receive support in this
fashion.

The AEB supports the principle of federalism, the devolution of power, as
well as the authority of provinces to levy taxes, but we cannot have a
province introducing taxes willy-nilly without reviewing the entire tax
dispensation, including that of central Government. Within the present
central tax framework we believe that this legislation is adequate, and we
shall support this legislation.]

Mr B A MNGUNI: Madam Speaker, it is a constitutional right of provinces to
impose taxes in order to generate revenue. This is enshrined in section
228(2)(b) of the Constitution. However, provinces have to exercise this
right within guidelines as determined by Parliament. An ordinary person on
the ground might think that we are now moving into a federal state. We are
not. South Africa is still a unitary state. It is only that we are abiding
by the Constitution, as required, and are giving some powers to the
provinces, also to promote the principle of co-operative governance.

Clauses 2(b) and 3(1) of this Bill promote co-operative governance. The
Minister has already alluded to that. The hon member Barbara Hogan, who is
the chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Finance, has already said a
lot on co-operative governance. During negotiations most parties argued
that provinces needed more powers. And we are providing that now. According
to the Constitution provinces are getting some of these powers.

I will try to limit my criticism as this is my maiden speech. However, as
individuals, hon members may raise a concern that since we are giving
provinces powers to impose taxes, what about the tax burden on individuals,
or investors for that matter? I think the Bill adequately addresses that
situation. In accordance with section 44(4) of the Constitution, the
principle of co-operative governance set out in Chapter 3 of the
Constitution does address those issues - that no province can impose taxes
that will interfere with the economy of other provinces or with the economy
of the country at large.

I do believe and trust that we have capable and responsible leaders who
will ensure that whatever taxes are imposed at provincial level will not at
any stage upset our macroeconomic fundamentals. As explained by my
colleague, hon member Hogan, the processes of this regulatory Bill clearly
state that the Minister may consult any other organ of state or interested
persons, including the Budget Council. So, I do not foresee any problem
where provinces impose taxes, or run their finances in such manner that
they render the provinces financially ungovernable.

I would like to disagree with hon member Ken Andrew that the Bill is taking
away powers of provinces to impose taxes, as the Minister has 90 days after
the responsible MEC has presented his his proposal to consider the Bill to
ensure that it is constitutional and to ensure that the Bill or the
Minister does not usurp the powers of the provinces. That is why there are
90 days after the MEC has made a presentation to the Budget Council for the
Minister to consider that.

As I come from a province, and being a former chairperson of a finance
committee, I know ANC provinces are running their finances properly.
[Interjections.] I have every faith in the MECs that they will continue
doing so. I do believe that this debate needs to go down to the provinces
and be robustly debated in the NCOP, because it is provinces themselves
that are going to be imposing these taxes. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, may I take the opportunity to
congratulate the hon Aaron Mnguni on his maiden speech. He is a wonderful
addition to the House.

Let me express appreciation to all the parties supporting this Bill. I
think the hon Koornhof has summed up the spirit. Common sense and cool
heads are what brought us to this point. We understand that the Bill,
because it deals with the powers of provinces, will have to be routed
through the NCOP in what clearly is going to be a fairly long process. But
I think in that process we must look towards this Bill being further
enriched. I accept the spirit that we legislate for the worst conditions.

However, I would just like to deal with some of the issues that some of the
members have raised. Firstly, the hon Andrew raised the issue of process. I
would, in the spirit of taking responsibility, apologise. It was not
something over which we had complete control. We are very appreciative of
the workload of the Portfolio Committee on Finance. This was pushed to the
front of the queue to accommodate a cycle that we did not entirely control.
I thank the committee for having dealt with what was clearly an imperfect
process and for the spirit in which it did so.

The hon Andrew said we must consider the pros and cons of different taxes
through learning. However, we came to this point through learning. Part of
what we have learnt is reflected in the Constitution in the way in which we
tried to put together a very divided past. One should talk to people who
have lived in Soshanguve for a long time. Because the taxes across the
road, in Mabopane, were different, people shopped in Mabopane. Or people
who lived in King William's Town could utilise similar opportunities in
Bisho. We must avoid that kind of artificial distinction between our
people. Part of what we try to capture, as is certainly reflected in the
way in which the Constitutional Court certified the Constitution, is to
move from that divided past to something that allows Parliament to
regulate, by way of legislation, going forward.

In respect of the responsibilities of the Minister to determine what is
constitutional, I think we must start from the premise that, as members of
the executive, we take an oath of office that requires of us to obey,
respect and uphold the Constitution and all other laws of the Republic. In
so doing, I think we must be permitted then to exercise judgment on what is
constitutional and what is not. We are not taking the responsibility away
from provinces. We are creating a loop whereby, having considered these
issues, we then talk to the provinces. If there are irreconcilable
differences we will then refer the matter to the Constitutional Court. But
I would like to believe that this is entirely within the spirit and letter
of the Constitution.

In respect of the point the member raised about our being intrusive, again,
the premise of the Constitution is not that we are a federation. The
premise is abundantly clear and the powers that the Constitutional Court
gave us in certifying the Constitution are such that they circumscribe the
powers of provinces and they ask of national Government to ensure the
coherence of the tax system. That power is one we need to understand
because it was carefully crafted in the process of certification.

In respect of the issue of time - clearly nobody would want to uphold a
request by a province, correctly put, unreasonably - we have created in
this legislation the responsibility to go back to the Budget Council with
progress reports on how we are applying our minds to the situation. So it
is not meant to take anything away from the provinces. I want to assure the
hon Andrew that all the issues that he has raised were carefully considered
and have been crafted into the legislation. But,  perhaps more importantly,
I am quite amused by the fact that the hon Rabie arrived at the same answer
along a very different route. He says that we have to guard against the
provinces unilaterally imposing taxes and levies. He is correct about that.
That is in fact what the hon Andrew is saying we must allow for. There is
complete contradiction in that. I can understand why theirs is known as the
``Dooie Alliansie''.
But speaking on behalf of the New NP and coming at the issue in the way
that he does, I think I take seriously the issues that were raised. The
Constitutional Court had advised that we should guard against the
unilateral imposition and construction of a fiscal Tower of Babel. This is
what we have tried to do. We will bring the additional legislation back to
Parliament. It is a complex process but it does place us in a position
where we live out the spirit of section 228(2)(b), close up that the way in
which the powers would be regulated would be through Acts of Parliament.

It does impose a further load on the Portfolio Committee on Finance, but we
trust that they will take it in exactly the same spirit and one that
requires us to live out the Constitution to uphold both the letter and the
spirit thereof. I thank all members, and especially the members of the
Portfolio Committee on Finance for the diligence in dealing with this Bill
and ask that we be allowed to send it on to the NCOP. [Applause.]

                      COUNTERFEIT GOODS AMENDMENT BILL

                       TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Speaker, colleagues in the House,
the amendments to these Acts are in essence technical, but they are
necessary in order that we may have a more effective body of legislation to
deal with counterfeit goods and the practice of ambush marketing.

The first amendment to the Counterfeit Goods Act deals with the need to
update our Act to accommodate prohibited marks, unregistered trademarks and
well known marks. Within the system of intellectual property there are
allowances for unregistered trademarks and well-known marks. Each national
jurisdiction has to establish how well-known marks are recognised. There
are various criteria set out by the World Intellectual Property
Organisation and the first amendments of this Act are designed to allow us
to seize products that violate these provisions for unregistered trademarks
and well-known marks.
In addition, we have made an adjustment to the Act to remove some lack of
clarity as to the compatibility of this Act with the Constitution as a
whole and other Acts in the criminal justice system. The amendment to the
Trade Practice Bill is to deal with ambush marketing.

This is a problem that emerges particularly in regard to sponsorships, and
one of the reasons we have addressed this now is the upcoming World Cricket
Cup. Many of the sponsors wanted to know whether we would be able to deal
with ambush marketing. Ambush marketing is the use of a major occasion to
advertise one's products without making any contribution to the sponsorship
of that occasion. I would suggest that these amendments are in essence
technical, although not unimportant, and I would urge the House to support
them.

Mrs B N SONO: Madam Speaker and hon members, the object of the Bill is to
bring the Counterfeit Goods Act of 1997 into line with the provisions of
Chapter 3 of the trade-related aspects on intellectual property rights
agreement.

A number of international conventions, treaties and multinational
agreements currently affect a large number of sectors in the economy. For
example, the mining sector, the textile and wine industries, and even the
gender sector, etc.

The DP regards the Counterfeit Goods Amendment Bill as the Trade and
Industry ministry's response to micro managing the dynamics of
globalisation. Accelerated structural reforms have, therefore, become a
necessity in positioning the country's strategically. Therefore, the DP
will support this Bill.

Relating to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill, the DP has no objections to
its aims and objectives, and therefore we will support it as well.
Hopefully the Bill will assist in bringing to an end certain practice known
as ambush marketing, but we question the ability and capacity of the law
enforcement agencies to bring these offenders to book in the light of the
already high level of serious crime incidents in the country.

The amendment to section 19 of the Act, which is aimed at increasing the
penalties for contravention for failing to comply with the provisions of
the Act, in the DP's view, will not necessarily singly act as a deterrent.

We should note that capacity is a real problem, and the DP believes that
certain policies which have a direct bearing on service delivery need to be
reviewed, and we would be happy to make inputs into such a process.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! There are far too many private meetings going on and
there is a lot of noise. Kindly conduct your private business outside the
Chamber.

Dr R H DAVIES: Madam Speaker, I noticed that the absence of the hon Mr
Bruce this afternoon has raised the tone of the debate. [Laughter.]

We are dealing here with two pieces of intellectual property legislation.
The Minister has explained their major purposes. Both these Bills, and
particularly the Counterfeit Goods Amendment Bill, underwent considerable
scrutiny in the committee, which explains the rather lengthy time between
their initial tabling and their presentation today before the House.

With respect to the Counterfeit Goods Amendment Bill, the committee had no
problem at all with the principle of extending the provision of the
Counterfeit Goods Act to cover fraudulent and misleading trade in
counterfeit of goods bearing well-known international marks. This is not
only because we have international obligations but, more importantly,
because committee members are concerned about protecting members of the
South African public against being misled into thinking that they are
buying some international brand of product, when in actual fact they are
being presented with a counterfeit.

I think that the committee also clearly recognised that trading in
counterfeit foreign goods can displace local jobs. The problem which we had
in the committee was a rather technical one. We were a bit concerned about
whether the formulation in the Bill could lead to a situation in which
legitimate South African businesses, using the mark which some foreign
concerns cloned as a well-known international mark, could find themselves
inadvertently, and contrary to the spirit of the Bill, vulnerable to action
under the Counterfeit Goods Act.

After much consultation and discussion with the legal people we were
finally persuaded that this would not happen. The definition of well-known
international marks is subject to the provisions of section 35 of the Trade
Marks Act and subordinate to the processes which are laid out in that Act
for recognition of well-known marks.

This amending Bill will, therefore, close an important loophole in the
Counterfeit Goods Act. Big, small and medium businesses in this country
need to know that henceforth trade in counterfeit foreign goods will be
outside of the framework of the law. We recognise that this will have an
impact on some small businesses and other businesses that have up to now
been conducting themselves on this basis.

Last week our committee hosted a presentation of the Proudly South African
Campaign. And I would suggest that the Proudly South African Campaign,
which I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss at greater length in
this House, does offer an alternative way forward to some of those who may,
up to now, have seen their future as a line in trade in counterfeit foreign
goods.

The Trade Practices Amendment Bill, as the Minister indicated, will ban
ambush marketing. It addresses the lacuna in our law that has been of some
concern to sponsors of major events and should successfully strengthen our
ability to negotiate the hosting of major sporting and other occasions.

The committee, again, discovered that this particular law may once again
restrict some existing practices of some businesses that are operating on
the margins of some events. However, we received assurances that all major
events that are hosted in South Africa would include provision for small
and medium businesses to find a place in the production of materials and
the provision of services for such events.

Once again, therefore, we are perhaps adversely affecting the current
operations and some businesses will open up, we hope, more sustainable and
viable opportunities in other directions.

The ANC will, therefore, be supporting the passage of these Bills.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I have appealed to you not to conduct
meetings. You are paying no attention. I am appealing to the Whips to
please keep their members in order.
Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, the Counterfeit Goods Amendment Bill should
be supported as it aims to bring the Counterfeit Goods Act of 1997 into
line with the Tripps agreement, to which South Africa is a signatory.

By extending the definition of intellectual property rights to include
those trademarks that have protection under the Paris Convention mentioned
in the Trade Marks Act, South Africa will extend protection to goods that
are well known and protected under the Paris Convention. Such goods can now
be seized and destroyed.

It is vitally important that South Africa extends the same level of
protection to trademarks and other intellectual property rights as its main
trading partners. This protection is one of the cornerstones of the free
market and property rights, and should not be endangered at all.
Notwithstanding the extension of protection, it might be worthwhile to
address the fate of the seized goods in other legislation. At the moment
these goods are destroyed. But a number of calls have been made for these
goods to be donated by the state to welfare agencies or for use in
emergencies such as during the recent flooding in the Western Cape.
Although controversial, such a move should at least be debated, not that we
say that it should be supported. But let us have a debate about that
particular aspect.

The Trade Practices Amendment Bill should be supported as it will
explicitly prohibit marketing activities referred to in trade as ambush
marketing. In such cases, unscrupulous marketers piggyback on the
legitimate marketers who may have paid large sums of money to secure
exclusive coverage of marketing events. Clearly, the practice is illegal,
but in the past it was not penalised under the common law. This Bill
clearly defines ambush marketing as an offence and sets certain penalties
in terms of the Trade Practices Amendment Bill.

Marketing or advertising rights can be regarded as ceded intellectual
property rights and should, therefore, enjoy the same level of protection
that is afforded to property rights in the Constitution. Both the
Counterfeit Goods Amendment Bill and the Trade Practices Amendment Bill are
being supported by the IFP. The IFP will support these Bills. [Applause.]

Dr R T RHODA: Madam Speaker, ambush marketing, which is what the amendment
to the Trade Practices Act seeks to prevent, infringes on the rights of
intellectual property owners. Ambush marketing occurs when a trader seeks
to utilise the public value of an event, for instance, a major sports
tournament or a concert, to gain benefit from it despite not having any
involvement in or connection with that event, or having made any financial
contribution to entitle him or her to derive benefit from it.

If event sponsors are not afforded sufficient protection for their
significant capital outlay in sponsoring events, events will not receive
adequate sponsorship. The consequence of this is that South Africa's
ability to compete for high profile international events, such as the
Soccer World Cup, the Olympic Games and Cricket World Cup 2003, will be
adversely affected. The amendment to the Trade Practices Act seeks to
address the problem by criminalising ambush marketing, as well as create
simple remedies to prevent it.

The worth or value of intellectual property to a country can be illustrated
by the fact, for example, that more than 5% of the gross domestic product
of the United States of America is generated by the copyright industry,
particularly the income flowing from the exploitation of copyright of
protected works. This contribution to the United States' GDP is greater
than the contribution of agriculture. It is thus little wonder that the
United States of America places such a high priority on foreign countries
affording proper protection to American intellectual property.

Only recently the United States stood on the verge of a trade war with
communist China, which would have entailed an American boycott of trade
with China on account of the failure by China to give proper protection to
American copyright works. The Chinese government, backing down and taking
appropriate steps, averted this trade war and gave appropriate assurances
to the United States of America that future American copyright works would
be properly protected.

On a very much smaller scale, South Africa now finds itself in the same
position as China. Overseas governments have decided that South Africa is
currently affording inadequate protection to famous trade marks. A
situation has arisen that local South African businesses have appropriated
famous trade marks and have, thereby, precluded overseas companies using
those trade marks from entering into the South African market and doing
business here. The situation has led to South Africa being placed on the so-
called section 301 ``watch list'' operated under the United States' Trade
Act.

In the event that South Africa is not perceived by the United States as
granting improved protection for famous American trade marks in future,
this country could, in due course, find itself in a similar position to
China and at the receiving end of American trade reprisals. These
international developments underline the considerable importance of
intellectual property and the value attached to it in the modern world.
South Africa, as a country which wishes to attract foreign investment,
should be at pains to ensure at all times that its intellectual property
laws create a receptive environment for foreign investment in South Africa.

It is a simple fact of life that foreign creators of intellectual property
are not willing to utilise their intellectual property in a country unless
they are satisfied that such property will enjoy satisfactory protection.
South Africa's future as a country could depend, to a significant degree,
on the extent to which it gives proper protection to intellectual property
rights.

Mr C T FROLICK: Madam Speaker and hon members, the Counterfeit Goods Act of
1997 defined intellectual property as contained in the Trade Marks Act of
1993, which also introduced the concept of well-known and famous marks.
When section 1 of the Counter Goods Act of 1997 was enacted, it did not
contemplate the inclusion of a well-known or famous trademark. Section 35
of the Trade Marks Act of 1993, on the other hand, recognises a well-known
mark.

The Counterfeit Goods Amendment Bill intends to broaden the definition of
intellectual property to include well-known and famous marks. The proposed
amendment before us will thus afford rights to local proprietors of rapidly
growing trade marks in South Africa, and will also afford protection to
proprietors who have used their trade marks abroad, but have not yet
registered them in our country.

The purpose of introducing the amendments contained in the Trade Practices
Amendment Bill is to widen the scope of the application of section 9 of the
Act, in which marketing was previously not viewed as a crime. This resulted
in no corrective action being taken.

The high costs associated with hosting or staging major public events and
the sponsors' right to gain publicity by aligning themselves with these
events need sufficient protection. Insufficient protection of sponsors'
rights would result in events not receiving adequate sponsorship. The
consequences could be that South Africa's ability to compete for high-
profile international events could well be compromised.

The UDM supports the amending Bills.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker and hon members, the ACDP is firmly of the
opinion that people own their intellectual property and we believe these
rights should be protected.

Biblical laws speak very clearly about property. First of all, it declares
that all property belongs to God, which includes the earth itself and all
creation.

Secondly, God established man in the possession of property under God, as a
basic aspect of the life of the family and as an essential of the economy
of the family.

Thirdly, God made property man's basic earthly security. Every attack on
private property is therefore an attack on man's liberty, and theft of any
form of property is not to be tolerated.

We also believe that we should honour our agreements, and for these
reasons, the ACDP will vote in favour of these Bills.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, the PAC supports the Counterfeit Goods
Amendment Bill, which is to amend the Counterfeit Goods Act of 1997, so as
to redefine intellectual property rights.

Legislation concerning intellectual property is concerned with the legal
rights associated with creative efforts, commercial reputation or goodwill.
This law deters others from copying the work of another and provides
remedies should this happen. It protects the rights of the originators to
exploit the benefits of their creations.
There are several areas and given rights that, together, make up
intellectual property. These are copyright, patents, registered designs,
trade marks, the law of confidence, rights of performance, design rights,
trade libel and passing off.

Intellectual property law is a new discipline, especially in Africa. That
is why there have been such massive copyright infringements of African
manuscripts, music, patents and inventions in Africa. For instance,
products such as aloe, well known and used by many African societies, have
now been patented by foreigners and are being sold back to African people
at exorbitant prices, and the thieves now enjoy the monopoly of a lot of
intellectual property, illegitimately so.

This Bill is timely. If the subject matter is a piece of music, the owner
of the copyright has the exclusive right to make copies of the music. The
related duty is a duty owned by all others not to infringe the right of the
originators of intellectual property.

African musicians in this country have died paupers because their
intellectual property rights were violated. The PAC believes that this
Bill, when it becomes law, will protect many intellectual property rights
which in this country were not sufficiently protected. The PAC will vote
for this Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the MF sees the structure that the
department is giving by broadening the definition of intellectual property
to include well-known and famous marks. The MF disapproves of the ambiguity
and unleashed power inspectors were given to act without warrant. The MF
hereby respects the order the amendments incorporate by clarifying the need
for a warrant and responsibility on the part of inspectors.

Unfortunately, the earlier Bill caused a bit of confusion regarding civil
and criminal proceedings, and the terms related to the Act. Note that the
amendment has corrected this by clarifying that civil and criminal
proceedings can be brought against people in terms of this Bill. The MF
also notes as in order the provision that the Bill has made to allow
attorneys, who have authority to appear in the High Court, to appeal before
Commissioners of patents courts.

The previous trade practices Bill instituted a control mechanism to prevent
harmful trade practices from being conducted. However, it is also noted
that though this Act was in place and correctly instituted, its definition
of harmful practices was narrow. The MF commends the department on its
amendment to this Act, having now inculcated a broader scope to harmful
trade practices, namely, ``ambush marketing''.

The MF finds all unjust and parasitic trade practices unfair and
intolerable. Many events are held to assist shortages and needs in order to
attend to escalating problems such as health, poverty, disaster, and to
assist charities.

Finding sponsors for such events is not easy and those who do sponsor are
merited for their contributions. The leeching of enterprises unrelated to
the event in gaining publicity is intolerable, and MF applauds the
department in noting this offence and marking it as unlawful.

The MF supports the Counterfeit Goods Amendment Bill and the Trade
Practices Amendment Bill.

Ms C C SEPTEMBER: Madam Speaker, broad agreement exists on the need for
expansion of our domestic markets, together with giving effect to these
strategies, giving effect so as to utilise our productive resources, our
employment opportunities and ending illegal trade practices.

The Counterfeit Goods Amendment Bill, which seeks to bring South Africa
into line with trade-related aspects on intellectual rights agreements,
also brings certainty in respect of where property rights are being stolen.
More importantly, it goes further and gives certainty, at least to an
inspector, when issuing a warrant where transgression of the law seeks to
occur.

As the `Proudly South African' campaign is being launched in two weeks'
time, this Bill comes at an opportune time to help avoid any embarrassing
moments in the campaign on trademarks, brand marks and ownership of such.
As the campaign unfolds, we must be alive to the fact that in terms of the
issue of label of origin, indigenous trademarks would want to find
solutions. Acting against counterfeit goods ends the illegal operations of
rogue companies and places more demand on one's domestic markets.

These amending Bills force us to follow good trade practices and therefore,
we as the ANC would want to offer an important component of consumer
awareness to our people, particularly those who are new to economic
activity, our constituency offices to roll out this mass training against
illegal trade practices, counterfeit goods, the stealing of property
rights, etc, and the public campaign of ``Proudly South African'' must
include informing South Africa that one cannot, on the one hand, want to be
proudly South African, but, on the other, do so through illegal means of
trading.

A further appeal would be to include the members of Parliament in the kind
of training that has already started through customs and excise on brand
names, labels, etc. It is so that, as public representatives, we seek to
end illegal trade practices. We do not necessarily have to be concerned
about whether the police and all these people would be able to cope, and
that we would have to take the responsibility for taking that on our
shoulders.

I was told that in the days of Jan Smuts, he apparently introduced a
requirement that when goods left South Africa they carried a label. I would
want hon members to investigate whether such a law exists, because it will
prevent us from reinventing the wheel. The ANC would support the Bills.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Speaker, thanks to all parties
and members in the House who have supported the amendments. I just want to
comment very briefly. Firstly, the hon member Sono raised the question of
capacity and ambush marketing. I think we can give some comfort here in
that, with regard to ambush marketing, it is those who are transgressed
against who would really take the action. I think most instances are
relatively easy to investigate.

With regard to some of the points raised by both hon member Rob Davies and
the PAC, I think that good practice in trademarks and intellectual property
is to the benefit of all. We are, as South Africa, beginning to take an
increasingly prominent role and leadership role in trying to define
intellectual property rights for intellectual knowledge and for many of our
natural products in Africa. And I think we cannot ask that our rights are
protected elsewhere if we do not protect those rights here in South Africa.
I therefore think the integrity of this policy is solid and sound.

Let me briefly also deal with the hon Hennie Bekker's proposal about
donating seized goods. We have used seized goods in certain cases,
particularly in emergencies, and very recently we did that again. But I
would be very reluctant about a blanket proposal of this type, because,
quite frankly, one of our biggest problems by far is that donations can re-
enter the market. I think unless we can be absolutely assured that there is
strict control over products, we will not be prepared to release these
products.

I would like to take issue very quickly with hon member Rhoda. I think it
is entirely inaccurate to suggest that South Africa does not have adequate
protection and we have objected very strongly to any indication by the US
that we had gone 301 in respect of these issues. I think that would be
unacceptable to us in the extreme. Our courts, in addition, have shown that
they are capable of administering this matter. The famous McDonalds case is
a case in point. We would therefore resist very strongly indeed any attempt
to place us on 301. The principle of 301 in any event is something South
Africa strenuously objects to. One cannot have unilateral action in a
multilateral trading system.

Let me say that we would welcome any request for members of Parliament to
receive training on this matter. I will deal with this more fully tomorrow.
I think we have had a very successful series of seminars across the
country, dealing with this whole issue of counterfeit goods and illegal
importation of those goods, and I am sure MPs will be a very important
component of that, if they so wish. I thank members for their support.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                    INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Speaker, it is clearly a day for
economic legislation. This amendment to the Act relating to the Industrial
Development Corporation is designed to update the Act to deal with some of
the realities of the present day for the IDC. The Act is a relatively old
one, first passed in 1940, and certainly since then very important changes
have taken place in the IDC, since 1994 in particular. We will be
considering other amendments over time, to modernise this Act and bring it
into line with the practices of the IDC.

I think the IDC is a structure that we are very proud of. I think it
certainly ranks as one of the premier development corporations in the world
today. And in South Africa's economic investment processes it plays a very
important role, as it does in promoting modern and efficient export
processes in South Africa.

There are four main areas that we are amending in the proposed Bill.
Firstly, the Bill seeks to adjust some of the objectives of the IDC to take
into account practices in which it has become very important. These are in
the areas of new aspects of the economy, particularly knowledge-intensive
aspects, tourism and general development activities related to these,
involvement in the spatial development initiatives and IDCs and,
increasingly, to provide venture capital for small and medium enterprises.

We have also widened the definition to specifically make mention of co-
operatives, and to allow it to invest more broadly in Southern Africa and
Africa. I think this is an important new dimension for the IDC. What we
find in practice is that the IDC plays an important role in major
investment projects, certainly in SADC and increasingly in Africa as a
whole. In many respects it is possibly Africa's premier development
corporation, and we should allow it to play a role in assisting other
economies in Africa. And in the context of the MAP programme, I think this
is very important.

Other amendments made to the Bill are mainly of a technical nature,
relating to the powers of the managing director and to modernising the Act
by removing a single reference to gender as always being ``he''. We would
urge support for these amendments. They allow the IDC to play the role that
it is playing very successfully in the economy.

And, as I have indicated to the committee, in the very thorough
consideration of this matter, we accept the proposition that the Act is an
old one and will need to be updated. We will begin that process and are
already in the process of making further amendments for discussion during
the next session of Parliament. [Applause.]

Mrs B N SONO: Madam Speaker, hon Members, the biggest challenge confronting
South Africa remains that of reconstruction and development. The narrow but
intense focus of the Government since the demise of apartheid has been the
implementation of state-determined transformation policies. A great deal of
attention has been devoted to policy implementation, re-engineering of
state machinery and simply taking over the reign of Government.

The reconstruction and development policy provides the framework for the
restructuring of the industrial landscape of the country to achieve the
vision and goals of transformation, reconstruction and developmental needs
of our society. The area of anticipated concern to the DP relates to the
issue of systems, that is right policies that lead to poor outcomes.
Understandably, to be credible the Government's policy cannot change willy-
nilly.

This Bill endeavours to focus and extend the scope of the activities of the
IDC, in line with the trade and industrial policy of the Government, with
special reference to the promotion of entrepreneurial activities of the IDC
in the area of small and medium enterprises. The Bill also proposes that
the IDC be explicitly empowered to promote the economic empowerment of the
historically disadvantaged.

One of the original objectives of the IDC, which has been successfully
accomplished, was to encourage investment in large industrial projects. The
danger is that if there is any movement away from that objective,
especially if this involves high-risk small businesses, it could undermine
confidence in the IDC's debt holding abroad and thus frustrate any further
investment in large industrial projects.

This deep apprehension must be seen against the fact that there are other
institutions that would be more appropriate to empower the SMMEs, such as
the Development Bank of South Africa. The resuscitation of South Africa's
industrial base should drive the focus of the Government's agenda.

The Government needs to outline an expanded role in labour-intensive public
projects to achieve the targeted economic growth of 6%. There is a dire
need to develop sufficient industrial capacity to sustain the new envisaged
objectives of the IDC. To use the words of the Finance Minister, Trevor
Manuel:
  A new interface is needed between those who have the needs and those who
  manage the money. At least then there would be clear justification for
  policy shifts when they are made and credibility would be maintained.

Nowhere in the world does government itself successfully finance a high-
risk project where there is little or no track record of success. This fact
is well known to foreign investors who provide the bulk of the IDC's
finance.

The IDC's reputation in internation capital markets is very high and it is
one of the few advantages that this country has. The official Opposition is
of the view that the Trade and Industry committee has not had any
justification for adjusting the objectives of the IDC.

Until the matter has been aired substantially and there has been an
opportunity for interested parties to air their views, the official
Opposition will maintain the concern articulated earlier. Even the Minister
has articulated here that this is still in the amending stage. Until the
Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry has been exposed to this, the
official Opposition will retain its position.

Dr R H DAVIES: Chairperson, the Industrial Development Corporation has
quite a critical role to play in promoting industrial development both in
this country and in the Southern African region, as well as on the broader
African continent. It is in fact the fourth largest South African public
corporation measured in terms of assets and the fifth largest in terms of
net income. With assets worth some R17,4 billion it ranks 29th in the South
African giant league.

The IDC's core strategy includes, and I quote: ``identifying and supporting
opportunities not yet addressed by the market''. Pursuing this objective of
playing a role in leading industrial development, the IDC in the past has
often played a strategic vanguard role in ensuring that major development
projects get off the ground, both in this country and elsewhere in the
region.

The legislation and the mandate under which this corporation operates is
thus of critical importance. As the hon the Minister indicated just now,
the IDC operates under an Act which was passed in 1940, when Jan Smuts was
the prime minister of this country, and, if I am not mistaken, Jan Hofmeyr
was the minister of economic affairs. This Act has been amended a number of
times since then and the corporation also operates under a mandate which
was given to it after 1994.

The present amending Bill, as the Minister indicated, has a limited number
of objectives. One of these, which in my view is one of the most important,
is to give the IDC the statutory right to operate beyond the borders of
South Africa in the Southern African region and on the broader African
continent as a whole. The corporation is already involved in some 30
projects in nine SADC member countries. These include an aluminium smelter
plant, mining, agriculture, manufacturing projects and tourism, but it has
had to secure authorisation for this on a case-by-case basis from the
Cabinet.

The present Bill will liberate the IDC from this constraint and enable it
to make its contribution to regional integration and the realisation of the
goals of the MAP. This aspect of the Bill has secured broad support and no
controversy whatsoever in the committee. The second objective is to raise
the corporation's gearing ratio from the current 75% of its share capital
to the still prudent 100% of its share capital and reserves. At the
committee stage we had to ensure that there was agreement and concurrence
from the national Treasury and this took some time to process, but finally
that aspect now appears to command broad support.

The Bill also makes a number of other amendments, including extending the
definition of its activity beyond manufacturing, narrowly conceived, and
also making a number of other incidental amendments to the corporation's
objectives. During the course of our processing the Bill, we were
approached by Cosatu, which urged us to approve some further amendments to
the amending Bill, and also to make some other amendments to the principal
Act itself which we did not envisage in the amending Bill. I am pleased to
say that we were able to accommodate some of the proposals made by Cosatu.
This included a clause defining one of the IDC's objectives as being to
foster the development of co-operatives as well as small, medium and micro
enterprises.

The IDC in fact offers some of the best terms and conditions to qualifying
small businesses. I believe it is significant that within this ambit we
will now form co-operatives in our country. With regard to some of the
other proposals in the Cosatu submission, the committee felt that these
raised a number of broader strategic issues that would have required
careful consideration and further input from other stakeholders. Several
proposals made regarding co-operative governance would probably have
commanded broad support in principle, but raised questions as to whether
they should be included in the principal Act and mandate or were in fact
covered by the Public Finance Management Act.

Other proposals would have required us to do what the hon Sono has
suggested, which would have been to go through much more detailed
discussions and negotiations with other stakeholders. The committee was not
in principle averse to pursuing such a task, but felt that it was not
warranted to hold up the present amending Bill pending the completion of
such a process. This is particularly the case if we bear in mind that this
is in fact being tagged as a section 76 Bill, which would probably have
meant that it would not have been completed before the end of the year.

Instead, we recommended that the Ministry and the department initiate a
process of relooking at the principal Act, which, as I said, was passed in
1940 and contains a number of obsolete provisions, but I am very pleased
that we heard from the Minister just now that the department and the
Ministry will indeed follow up such a process.

With these few remarks, I take pleasure in indicating that the ANC will be
supporting the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Mr Chairperson, the Cabinet has recently extended the
mandate of the Industrial Development Corporation to expand its operations
into Africa in line with the finalisation of the SADC trade protocol. There
is, therefore, a need to amend the Industrial Development Act in order to
enable the IDC to legitimately carry out its extended mandate.

The fact that the Bill proposes to change the IDC's objective to include
the economic development of Southern Africa and Africa should be supported,
as it will provide the Government with a vehicle to play a more active
developmental role in the region and on the continent. This should be used
to ensure that South Africa's participation in the New Africa Initiative
goes beyond lip service and that it extends to concrete development
projects.

The Industrial Development Corporation's objectives will now also include
the empowerment of historically disadvantaged communities and persons
through its investments. This will be important, especially as
underfinanced empowerment companies will be able to enter capital-intensive
industries such as manufacturing, mining and telecommunications.

The fact that the chairperson of the IDC will now be a nonexecutive
director, and that he or she will not be allowed to be the managing
director, should also be supported, as this practice is in line with the
King report on corporate governance.

The IFP supports the legislation.

Dr R T RHODA: Mr Chairperson, the IDC is a self-financing, state-owned
development finance institution. Its primary objectives are to contribute
to the generation of, and to create a balance in, sustainable economic
growth in Southern Africa, and to further the economic prosperity of all
citizens. The main admendment seeks to allow the IDC to extend its
activities beyond the borders of the RSA for the benefit of the Southern
African region specifically, and the rest of Africa in general. This is to
be welcomed.

I am, however, not certain why we need so many other amendments to achieve
this. Certainly there is no need to change the main objectives of the IDC.
I am sure we will all agree that economic integration is of critical
importance to the Southern African Development Community, for it not only
carries the politically beneficial element of co-operation between
neighbouring countries and a louder voice in global forums, but also,
hopefully, numerous potential benefits for the region's economy.

I believe economic integration will enhance intraregional trade on the back
of preferential access to a wider potential export market, and will present
numerous opportunities for profitable cross-border investments targeting
the individual country's natural resource endowments and competitive
advantages. Furthermore, it should be conducive to efficiency gains,
promote the transfer of technology and skills, assist regional players in
attaining economies of scale, and, among other things, improve access to
information.

Regional integration will, I believe, also enhance the visibility of
individual countries as potential markets, as suppliers of goods and
services and as global investment destinations. It appears that the IDC has
already progressively intensified its involvement in the SADC region,
acting as a catalyst for investment in productive capacity, identifying
sound investment opportunities, promoting inward investment and, if I am
correct, I think we are providing extended credit facilities to SADC buyers
of South African capital goods and related services.

With regard to our own home, South Africa, and endeavours to focus on and
extend the scope of the activities of the IDC to link with the trade and
industry policy of Government, with special reference to the promotion of
entrepreneurial activities by the IDC in the area of small and medium
enterprises, it is proposed that the IDC be explicitly empowered to promote
the economic empowerment of historically disadvantaged communities and
persons. In other words, it concerns promoting the development of small
enterprises, increasing opportunities for black economic empowerment,
reducing inequality and poverty, and facilitating access to sustainable
economic activity and empowerment for all in South Africa.
These are very fine words, but when our people approach these wonderful
institutions for assistance they virtually enter a different world. The DTI
empowerment schemes, especially those aimed at small business, are far too
complicated to access and understand clearly. The bulk of our historically
disadvantaged, highly-skilled workforce are unfortunately not acquainted
with the sophisticated business and legal terminology used in most of the
DTI documents and applications. We need, I think, a more entrepreneur-
friendly Department of Trade and Industry.

We support the Bill.

Mr C T FROLICK: Mr Chairperson and hon members, the purpose of the Bill is
to amend the Industrial Development Act and to extend the focus and
functions of the IDC beyond the borders of South Africa to include Southern
Africa, as agreed to in the SADC protocol.

The Bill also empowers the managing director to delegate certain powers to
other structures of the corporation. It repeals certain obsolete gender-
insensitive and discriminatory provisions. The Bill further extends the
activities of the IDC in line with the trade and industrial policies of
Government, with special emphasis on the promotion of small and medium
enterprises.

The amendments support the economic empowerment of historically
disadvantaged communities and persons. During the public hearing stage of
proceedings, organised labour proposed several valid amendments. Although
not pertaining to the objectives of this Bill, we are sure that that will
form part of the broader discussion in future.

Amongst the amendments proposed, which the UDM supports, were provisions
for making employment an explicit objective of the IDC, providing broader
support for SMMEs and co-operatives, providing for the extension of
differential interest rates, developing a developmental focus and not only
a narrow business orientation, broader developmental criteria for the
selection of IDC investments and compliance of IDC investment projects with
labour legislation.
Common agreement was reached within the committee that the activities of
the IDC needed to be placed within the broader framework of industrial
development policy in Southern Africa. Discussion on a broader industrial
development framework for South Africa, set within the bigger economic
developmental picture, is something which we must strive for with vigour.
The UDM supports the Bill.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Mr Chairperson, an important ethical question we should be
asking ourselves is: Should taxpayers' money be spent outside of South
Africa?

Whilst it can be convincingly argued that what is good for the region is
good for South Africa, does Government, firstly, have the right to use our
limited resources to develop neighbouring countries? South African
taxpayers' money should surely be used only in South Africa. However,
project money, on the other hand, raised elsewhere, ie from the IFC or the
World Bank or from banks abroad, would be perfectly acceptable.

Secondly, it is important that the IDC does not lose its primary focus. It
should continue to do what it does well, and do it in the national
interest. Large projects with enormous spin-offs for the region, especially
long-term projects with an intergenerational view, are clearly the IDC's
forte. In this regard they have a proven track-record of making things
happen which would not normally happen, due to the risk companies take for
longer-term projects or the cost of money for such projects.

It is our opinion that the impact the IDC has should not be diffused by
drawing their focus to smaller projects for which Khula was established.
The stainless steel project in Sasol is an example of where the IDC
facilitated enormous spin-offs for beneficiation downstream of the primary
industry, without changing its focus.

Lastly, the ACDP is concerned about the reference in the Bill to the rest
of Africa generally. I believe this should refer to neighbouring countries
or SADC instead, as the danger of casting the net too wide is a reality.
Development in the rest of Africa must be secondary to what is done in
South Africa and where these projects are undertaken, there must be clearly
determined linkages to benefits for South African companies.

In spite of these reservations, the ACDP will vote in favour of this Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the economic empowerment of the historically
disadvantaged, communities and persons, and the repeal of absolutely gender-
insensitive and discriminatory provisions are all attractive advancements
to the MF. The MF hereby commends the department for this. The rapid
globalisation and the need for the Republic to make its stance, not only
for South Africa, but Africa as a whole, is important and due.

The MF notes that the provisions of this Bill supports this. However, the
global market is often as ruthless as it is welcoming, and we have to tread
carefully to ensure that our position is taken up efficiently and
effectively, and is well built.

The MF notes that such an advancement may not be successful solely because
of the larger industries, but with the incorporation and catering for small
and medium entrepreneurs, our markets will be set for success. The
potential of an entity to perform should not be judged by size. However,
through the eagerness and determination for growth and success, and the
attainment of prestigious competitors, the global market is attainable.

The MF expresses its support and believes in South Africa's strength and
ability. As a united force represented and established with organisation,
procedures and an establishment plan, we may all make our mark with a
modicum of success.

The MF supports the Industrial Development Amendment Bill.

Mr S M RASMENI: Chairperson, the vision of the Industrial Development
Corporation, as stated in its budget presentation, is to build a leading
generation of commercially sustainable industrial development and
innovation for the benefit of South Africa and Southern Africa. We see the
introduction of the Industrial Development Amendment Bill as an instrument
for fulfilling this vision. We, from the ANC, welcome the introduction of
this amending Bill and support its passing with amendments.

The Bill seeks to extend the activities of the IDC beyond the borders of
South Africa, into Southern Africa and Africa. The Bill endeavours to focus
and extend the scope and the activities of the Industrial Development
Corporation in line with the trade and industry policy of our Government,
with special reference to the promotion of entrepreneurial activities by
the IDC in the area of small and medium enterprises. It is proposed that
the IDC be explicitly enabled to promote the economic empowerment of
historically disadvantaged communities and persons.

To the members of the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry and indeed
other people, including Cosatu, the Bill provides a golden opportunity to
bring into reality the vision of our industrial policy, namely, the
empowering of emerging entrepreneurs, supporting manufacturing, tourism
development, agro-industries and small-scale mining.

We as the policy-makers note and recognise the importance of the IDC with a
loan book of R22 billion and encourage the provision of loans to black
entrepreneurs. We support the recent press statements that the group plans
to further increase the number and value of financing authorisations to
black businesses over the next few years.

When asked to explain funding for previously disadvantaged communities and
persons, the IDC told us that they only provided funding from a minimum of
R1 million upwards. Our knowledge and experience tell us that the
previously disadvantaged communities need funding from the range between
R20 000 to R1 million. This is the area where the majority of small
businesses and enterprises are concentrated. The majority is in the rural
areas. We will be consulting the IDC on this matter.

The majority of loans, understandably, go to the three major cities:
Johannesburg in Gauteng, Cape Town in the Western Cape, and Durban in
KwaZulu-Natal. But if we are to structurally break from the legacy of the
past, then, these trends will need to be changed. We want to see a
meaningful role played by the IDC in promoting the empowerment of
previously disadvantaged communities in order to realise the sustainable
economic activity and employment of all South Africans in particular and
Africans in general.

We, as the ANC, support this Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Mr Chairperson, I would just like to
deal with a few matters that have arisen which, I think, should be cleared
up. Firstly, the hon Sono seemed to feel that the IDC was entering a new
terrain with SMMEs. This is not the case. Our approach that we have taken
to the amendment is that, in the legislation, the general objectives of the
corporation should be stated. More detailed aspects should be dealt with in
the mandate.
Accordingly, it was felt that we should clarify that one of the objectives
is to deal with SMMEs. However, we should also clarify that the corporation
had been dealing with these enterprises for some time. In the last five
years, some 369 SMMEs were financed. In year 2000 alone and over the five-
year period nearly R4 billion were provided for 1 200 SMMEs, thus creating
some 35 000 jobs.

So, our view is that this is not an increased risk for the IDC at all. This
is an activity that we are undertaking. The hon Rasmeni pointed out that
the limit that we go to is for loans of R1 million. We in the Department of
Trade and Industry would strongly argue for that. It is the case that the
IDC will not specialise in micro or very small enterprises. It is a
specialised financing organisation dealing, in the main, with those
activities and enterprises that are in the capital market.

Let me also say that, I think, the IDC, as I indicated in my opening
remark, is a premier financing organisation on the African continent and
probably one of the top development financing organisations in the world.
Accordingly, we have to be conscious of its ability to enter capital
markets and the DTI is very vigilant in that respect.

We want the IDC to be able to enter capital markets at very good rates.
Accordingly, I think, we must be cognisant of the fact that how we manage
the IDC must be within the constraints of the capital markets. But, as a
developmental organisation owned by Government, we can extend its mandate
into areas that the markets themselves may not go into.

Let me point out to the hon member Rhoda that we had to make these
additional amendments. Our purpose is to define the objectives very
carefully. Probably one of the most important amendments made to the
objectives is to extend the area of financing possibilities to aspects of
the economy that are not traditionally or strictly seen as industrial. I
think this is just a realisation that the economy is changing, things are
changing, and that sectors such as tourism, information technology,
logistics and other aspects which would not be classified strictly under
the SAIC classifications as industrial, need to be expanded. We needed to
make these changes.

Let me say very quickly that the last time the IDC received taxpayers'
money was a long, long time ago. Yes, the hon member is correct, it is a
state-owned corporation. It was capitalised with taxpayers' money. But it
is, essentially, a self-financing organisation. In this regard, we think it
is entirely valid for it to enter activities in Africa. Bear in mind that
Eskom, Transnet and other self-financing corporations enter African
terrain, because we have an economy integrated with most of Africa. I
therefore think this is a justified position.

I want to stress that the IDC will not replace Khula. Khula is not a direct
retail financer. The IDC does not go to very small enterprises, which Khula
would be prepared to guarantee. The IDC really exists in the terrain of
small and medium enterprises, certainly not micro. It is not competing with
Khula in any respect in that regard.

I would like to thank hon members for the support for these amendments. I
think they are important, and they bring the IDC into line with the
realities and allow it to continue its very critical function in the South
African and African economies. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.
