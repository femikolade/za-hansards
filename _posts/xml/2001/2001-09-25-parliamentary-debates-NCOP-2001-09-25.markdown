                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move  at  the  next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the DP wants  to  congratulate  the  Minister  of  Environmental
           Affairs and Tourism as well as Marine and Coastal Management  on
           the way in  which  they  conducted  the  first  process  of  the
           allocation of long-term fishing rights;


       (b)  the DP is of the view that the department  has,  for  the  first
           time in history,  shown  compassion  and  understanding  without
           jeopardising the integrity of the process;


       (c)  the DP intends to monitor the next processes very carefully  and
           to continue to be the voice of the fishermen and fisherwomen  by
           -


           (i)   submitting an in-depth  report  to  the  Public  Protector
                  regarding corruption in  the  industry,  within  the  next
                  fortnight;


           (ii)  means of a  continued  effort  to  have  snoek  and  other
                  nonendangered linefish species excluded from the  linefish
                  sector; and


           (iii) proposing a new inshore  fishing  policy  whereby  fishing
                  communities will benefit the most;


  (2) calls on the Minister to investigate Hout Bay Fishing, whose original
       allocation of 200 tons of hake longline increased by 500 tons to  700
       tons during the so-called Treichsman investigation, and to  determine
       who was responsible for this lavish increase; and


  (3) further notes that the DP will keep on fishing for answers.

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek sal by  die  volgende  sitting  van  die
Raad voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) van mening is dat omgesien moet word na die  instandhouding  van  die
       Raadsaal se toerusting, byvoorbeeld die mikrofoonstelsel, wat  vandag
       'n groot verleentheid vir al ons lede is;


  (2) voorts die mening uitspreek dat dringend aandag gegee moet  word  aan
       die agteruitgang van die gebou, wat reeds vir lede  en  besoekers  'n
       gevaar inhou, byvoorbeeld  die  plafon  bokant  die  galery,  waarvan
       stukke reeds afgeval het en waarin krake voorkom; en


  (3) ofskoon daarvan bewus dat restourasie en herbouing gedurende Desember
       plaasvind, nogtans van mening is dat gouer opgetree moet word en  dat
       lede beter verdien as wat tans die geval is.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, at the  next  sitting  of  the  Council  I
shall move -


  That the Council -


  (1) is of the opinion that the maintenance  of  the  Chamber's  equipment
       must be seen to, for example, the microphone system, which is a great
       embarrassment to all our members today;


  (2) further expresses the opinion that urgent attention needs to be given
       to the deterioration of the building, which is already  a  danger  to
       members and visitors, for example, the ceiling above the gallery,  in
       which cracks have appeared and pieces of which  have  already  fallen
       down; and


  (3) despite being aware that restoration and rebuilding will  take  place
       during December, is still of the opinion that action  must  be  taken
       sooner and that members deserve better than is currently the case.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I am glad you now agree, Mr Van Niekerk!

        SHOOTING AT JOHANNESBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT CARGO SECTION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a cargo agent was yesterday shot and killed by an armed gang  at
           the cargo section  of  the  Johannesburg  International  Airport
           during a botched robbery, after the robbers had gained access to
           the South African Airways cargo section;


       (b)  on  their  way  out,  the  gang  randomly  fired  shots  at  the
           checkpoint and managed  to  take  a  firearm  from  one  of  the
           security guards during the robbery attempt; and


       (c)  all the attackers escaped;


  (2) resolves that, although this specific incident posed no direct threat
       to passengers at the airport as the cargo section is four  kilometres
       away, the security arrangements at the  cargo  sections  of  airports
       should at all times be effective, as unlawful entry  to  these  areas
       poses life-threatening risks to many  people,  including  passengers;
       and


  (3) therefore requests the  Minister  of  Safety  and  Security  and  the
       Minister  of  Public  Enterprises  to  ensure   that   the   security
       arrangements at  all  our  airports,  including  the  cargo  sections
       thereof, are effective.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.
       THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE ON THE FABRIC OF SOCIETY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Chairperson, hon  members  of  the
NCOP, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the  opportunity  to  address  the
NCOP on this matter of national interest. The fact that this debate  on  the
effects of alcohol on the fabric of society is taking place  the  day  after
our celebration of Heritage Day underlines its importance  to  our  national
project of reconstruction and development.

This situates this debate within the context  of  our  inheritance  and  our
current efforts to build a caring and people-centred society. This  is  also
a reminder that in examining the effects of alcohol on  the  fabric  of  our
society,  we  are  also  reflecting  upon  our  individual  and   collective
identities and on our efforts to forge a set of shared goals.

The far-reaching socioeconomic changes that our people  are  effecting  need
to be accompanied by  a  moral  regeneration  which  rebuilds  the  positive
social  values  eroded   by   decades   of   oppression,   state   violence,
dehumanisation,   poverty,   social   dislocation   and   lack   of   social
infrastructure.

There can  be  no  underplaying  of  the  magnitude  and  dimension  of  the
challenge facing our society. Because of our history  and  globalisation  we
have, for some time now,  been  experiencing  a  growing  problem  of  heavy
consumption and problematic use of alcohol in our country.

It is reported that  while  half  of  the  adult  population  do  not  drink
alcohol, about a third of the men and women who do  drink  do  so  at  risky
levels,  particularly  during  weekends.  For  many  drinkers,  drinking  to
intoxication is the norm.

Although there is variation between provinces, the impact of  alcohol  abuse
is an issue of national concern in this country.

Our debate  has  to  encompass  a  range  of  both  long-standing  and  more
contemporary issues. These include  the  linkages  between  alcohol,  crime,
domestic violence, sexual  abuse  and  victim  empowerment.  The  issues  of
concern also include the glorification of alcohol in the  media,  supply  of
alcohol to farmworkers, random  drug-taking  and  testing  in  schools,  job
creation, support programmes at  the  workplace  and  the  encouragement  of
responsible living.

Our debate has to be comprehensive and draw upon the  information  available
from local research institutions. The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Research  Group
of the Medical Research Council has conducted a number of important  studies
on the medical and social aspects of  alcohol  abuse  in  our  country.  The
Human Sciences Research Council has concluded  research  into  the  linkages
between drugs and crime. Our  debate  must  be  anchored  to  this  research
information and lead to appropriate action.

Our debate should also be  informed  by  the  experience  of  the  voluntary
social welfare sector. The  SA  National  Council  on  Alcoholism  and  Drug
Dependence, Sanca, and its affiliates have, for many  years,  been  actively
involved in public education and the provision of treatment services to  all
our people.

More recently, the Central Drug Authority has begun to  play  its  envisaged
leadership role in the implementation of the National Drug Master Plan.  The
quantification of the burden of harm associated with the use of  alcohol  is
an ongoing  task.  This  quantification  of  harm  encompasses  the  health,
criminal justice  and  transport  systems.  Alcohol  abuse  has  direct  and
indirect  impacts   on   work   performance,   economic   productivity   and
competitiveness.  Most  critically,  it  impacts  on  family  life  and  the
production of the  social  capital  that  is  vital  to  reconstruction  and
development.

In urban areas this impact is manifested in a  wide  range  of  social  work
cases. In rural areas the harm  is  not  as  well  quantified  but  just  as
significant, given that 90% of the alcoholic beverages consumed are  sorghum
and malt beer.

Over the years, the entire social welfare sector has established a range  of
services to address the problem of alcohol abuse in  our  country.  Services
include  prevention,  early  intervention,  treatment,  rehabilitation   and
aftercare services. The Department of  Social  Development  administers  the
Prevention and Treatment of Drug Dependency Act, Act 20 of 1992,  and  plays
a major role in the financing of services  offered  by  the  Government  and
nongovernmental agencies. The challenge is to ensure  that  this  basket  of
services is accessible to all our people. Priority also has to be  given  to
increasing social censure against the use of alcohol and drugs.

Our National Drug Master  Plan,  which  covers  the  period  1999  to  2004,
details a number of strategies for reducing  alcohol-related  harm  and  the
social cause of alcohol misuse. A focus on the youth is  a  key  feature  of
the plan. The implementation of the strategies in the plan is  a  task  that
requires a concerted effort from all sectors of society.

I hope that today's debate on the effects of alcohol abuse on the fabric  of
our society will address all the issues that I have briefly  mentioned,  and
galvanise individual and collective action by all our people. [Applause.]

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon  MECs,  special  delegates  and
hon members, the matter for discussion before us today is  very  significant
in the sense that many of us can  talk  on  it  without  having  to  do  any
special  research  or  to  consult  experts.  We  have  either  directly  or
indirectly experienced the effects of  drugs  and  substance  abuse  in  our
families or communities. Some of  us  who  will  be  participating  in  this
debate today might, therefore, be speaking from personal experience on  this
evil.

In his first opening address to  Parliament  in  1994,  ex-President  Nelson
Mandela singled out alcohol and drug  abuse  as  a  major  cause  of  crime,
poverty, reduced  productivity,  unemployment,  dysfunctional  family  life,
escalation of chronic diseases, injury and premature death.

I want us to remember what sparked the initiation of  this  debate.  It  was
the untimely death, a few months ago, of a teenager who  was  being  treated
at a rehabilitation centre in the Northern Cape. This boy, in the  prime  of
his life, would today have been  nervously  preparing  to  write  his  final
examinations and looking forward to  entering  a  tertiary  institution,  in
preparation  for  entry  into   productive   adulthood   and   the   various
responsibilities that go with it. Unfortunately, because of drugs, his  life
ended abruptly, and he is no longer with us.

Let me once more take this  opportunity  to  pass  our  condolences  to  his
family and loved ones and to the families and loved ones of  all  those  who
have fallen prey to drugs and other substances and  have  subsequently  lost
their lives as a direct result. It is unfortunate that  we  have  to  recall
these sad events in order to educate ourselves, and  more  importantly,  our
youth, on the inevitable course their lives will follow if they  succumb  to
the temptation of drugs and other addictive substances.

I want us to look at this whole debate within the socioeconomic  sphere  and
how that influences drug and substance abuse.  I  hail  from  the  so-called
northern areas of Port Elizabeth, and those who know the Eastern  Cape  will
know which areas I am talking of. These are the areas where one  would  find
the the working class of  the  so-called  coloured  community.  In  all  the
families I know, relatives included, there was at least one person  who  had
a drinking problem. Other addictive substances that were  also  common  were
methylated spirits and glue. These were mainly consumed by those  unemployed
and living on the streets.

As hard drugs became more fashionable, heroin, crack  cocaine  and  ecstasy,
amongst others, were added to the list. I had  the  unfortunate  experience,
at a very tender age, of seeing a person who had died as  a  result  of  the
intake of methylated spirits over a long period of time, and  it  is  not  a
pretty sight.

Witnessing the destruction, pain and unimaginable psychological damage  that
drug and substance abuse can cause within families  and  communities  placed
me in the fortunate position  where  I  could  use  those  circumstances  as
learning experiences, stand back and  say  to  myself  that  this  will  not
happen to me. It was an educative experience  in  itself,  but  many  of  my
peers, friends and relatives were not so  fortunate.  I  had  an  aunt  who,
three years ago, in 1998, committed suicide after having been in a cycle  of
alcohol abuse for a number of years.

Regarding crime, statistics of research done in three Metros  -  Cape  Town,
Durban and Johannesburg  -  released  in  a  joint  report  by  the  Medical
Research Council and the Institute for Security Studies, made the  following
findings: overall, 45% of arrestees tested positive for at least  one  drug.
As many as 66% of arrestees testing positive for at least one drug  were  20
years and younger. An average of more  than  50%  of  persons  arrested  for
housebreaking, motor vehicle theft and rape tested  positive  for  at  least
one drug. Almost half of all persons arrested on charges related  to  family
violence indicated that they were under the  influence  of  alcohol  at  the
time of the arrest and at the time when the offence was committed.

With regard to reduced productivity, which the  Minister  also  touched  on,
our health workers, social workers and, of course, employers can testify  to
the impact that drug and alcohol-related illnesses have on our economy,  our
physical health and mental health. Thousands of work hours  are  lost  owing
to absenteeism in the workplace.  Drugs,  in  particular,  target  the  most
productive population of our society, namely young adults. As  a  result  of
drug addiction, their acquired skills are lost.  Eventually  they  become  a
burden to our very limited state resources.

Related to reduced productivity is the issue of unemployment.  Living  in  a
capitalist society like ours,  there  is  no  employer  that  will  tolerate
continual  absenteeism  and  nonperformance  on  the  part  of  his  or  her
workforce, especially if it is drug or alcohol-related. We  have  all  heard
of breadwinners losing their jobs as a result  of  substance  abuse.  It  is
also unfortunate that it is usually those at the bottom of the income  scale
with no  or  little  education  who  end  up  being  unemployed  because  of
substance abuse.

With  regard  to  poverty,  alcohol  is  far  more  widely  used  in  poorer
communities than any other substance or drug abused. Poverty is one  of  the
most important factors contributing to alcohol abuse or  misuse.  Access  to
alcohol increases substantially in poverty-stricken areas where  people  are
involved in informal micro enterprises, often selling home-brews  and  other
alcoholic beverages from shebeens to make extra money. It is estimated  that
there are approximately 200 000 shebeens  in  South  Africa,  and  they  are
found mostly in black residential areas, further contributing to  the  cycle
of poverty.

Regarding dysfunctional family life, I am sure there is no  person  in  this
House  who  has  not  seen  the  crumbling  of  family  relations  and   the
disintegration of friendships as a direct result of  alcohol  and  substance
abuse. Divorce between parents, parents disowning  their  children,  friends
abandoning friends - all of this becomes the order  of  the  day  and  gives
rise to a continuation in the spiral of dysfunctional  family  and  societal
relationships.

With regard  to  the  escalation  of  chronic  diseases,  I  want  to  place
particular emphasis on HIV/Aids and TB. Here, health workers  will  tell  us
that it is common knowledge that the intake of harmful substances over  long
periods of time reduces the body's resistance.  It  therefore  cannot  fight
off illnesses that it otherwise would have under normal circumstances.

Drugs and other  intoxicating  substances,  therefore,  interfere  with  the
normal functioning of vital organs like the brain,  liver,  lungs,  pancreas
and heart. I do not want to give a biology lesson here, because I think  all
of us are aware of the  consequences.  I  think  we  all  know  the  obvious
results if the workings of these organs are  interfered  with:  illness  and
disease of untold proportions and eventually death, as well  as  injury  and
premature death.

The figures of the carnage on  our  roads  speak  for  themselves.  A  large
number of accidents caused on our roads are as  a  result  of  intoxication.
The launch of the Arrive Alive  campaign  was  an  acknowledgement  of  this
fact. Annually, thousands of people are killed in road accidents, either  as
pedestrians or as occupants of vehicles. Over the  Easter  period  of  1998,
11,9% of all road accidents were  a  direct  result  of  drugs  or  alcohol.
Unfortunately, these were the  last  figures  that  I  could  get  from  the
Department of Transport.

In conclusion, I want to  focus  on  some  policy  recommendations  for  the
department. I believe that interventions  around  prevention  should  target
the youth in particular. Therefore, I want to reiterate the  recommendations
made by the SA Community Epidemiology Network on Drug  Use,  Sacendu,  in  a
document entitled ``Sacendu Highlights, May 2001''.

Sacendu recommends that government departments, namely the  Health,   Social
Development, Education and Justice departments, in collaboration  with  NGOs
and faith-based organisations, work together to ensure  that  the  following
recommendations are implemented: a multipronged  intervention  programme  to
eradicate drugs and substance abuse; increase the  range  of  treatment  and
prevention programmes focusing on children  and  youth;  equip  teachers  to
identify substance abuse and make the appropriate referrals; improve  access
to quality school-based prevention programmes;  train  police  to  recognise
particular symptoms and establish protocols on handling arrestees under  the
influence;  equip  parents  and  caregivers  to  reduce  risk  behaviour  by
adolescents, for example,  monitoring  behaviour,  setting  limits,  dealing
with hostility and safeguarding medicines; and increase the availability  of
programmes  aimed  at  addressing  substance  abuse  among  young  offenders
through  court  diversion  treatment,  prison-based  programmes  and   post-
incarceration options.  Lastly,  employers  should  also  be  encouraged  to
implement policies and practices to address alcohol and drug  abuse  in  the
workplace. [Applause.]

Ms  M  KHUNWANA  (North  West):  Chairperson,   Minister,   colleagues   and
distinguished guests, I stand here on behalf of  Mayisela,  the  North  West
MEC for social services, arts, culture and sports. We would  like  to  thank
the NCOP Select Committee on Social Services for choosing this topic, so  as
to put the plight of affected children  and  families  at  the  top  of  the
national agenda.

Before one can venture into the effects of drug and  alcohol  abuse  in  our
society, I think we need to look at the nature of the society which we  live
in today. Our society can still be regarded as a transitional  one.  We  are
transiting from a structured and  close  society  based  on  fear,  secrecy,
degradation and exploitation. However, on a positive  note,  since  1994  we
have begun a journey to a society free from want, an open and caring one.

The mandate of the Department of social services, arts, culture  and  sports
in our province is to create a caring society, which creates an  environment
for all and sundry to fight the negative effects  of  social  ills  such  as
drugs and alcoholism. According to Peter Powis, writing in  the  March  2001
edition of  the  Child  and  Youth  Care  journal,  chemical  dependency  or
addiction to drugs and alcohol manifests  itself  in  three  ways,  that  is
physical, psychological  and  spiritual.  For  me,  this  categorisation  is
comprehensive and is also assisting  us  to  come  up  with  mechanisms  for
addressing substance abuse in our society.

It is physical in the sense that substance abuse  causes  damage,  depending
on which substance is taken into an organ or organs in  the  body.  This  is
frightening if one thinks of young people,  who  are  victims  of  substance
abuse, more so when it is considered that the brain of a child of 18  or  19
is still growing. The negative effects of brain damage are well known,  even
to practising social scientists like us.

The psychological effects of  substance  abuse  are  more  damaging  to  our
society, because they defeat any programme that can be  identified  to  deal
with this monster. At the core is the denial that all victims  of  substance
abuse suffer. It is also accompanied by  traits  such  as  self-centredness,
self-absorption, low self-esteem, prolonged resentment  and  blame,  because
all  these  are  mentally  driven.  Thus,  victims  find  justification  for
continuous use of these substances.

At the spiritual level, the victim  of  substance  abuse  always  feel  deep
emptiness. There is also an inner  feeling  of  fear  that  accompanies  the
victim. As a result of a combination of factors, the victim  has  shame  for
himself or herself and lives in isolation.

The implications of the above scenario to families are  not  only  negative,
but also have the potential  to  defeat  our  noble  objective  of  building
strong and balanced family units. I am in particular referring to  families,
because they are critical in shaping growing minds. Hence there is a  saying
in isiXhosa which says that an injury to the  brain  is  tantamount  to  the
injury of an individual, the injury of an individual is  tantamount  to  the
injury of the family and the injury of  the  family  is  an  injury  to  the
nation. If we understand  the  dialectical  relations  of  the  above-quoted
paradigm, we then have an obligation to start with rebuilding our  families.
It is because  family  units  are  the  strongest  building  blocks  of  any
society.

Let me take this opportunity  to  elaborate  on  the  mechanisms  that  both
Government and civil society need to employ to  combat  substance  abuse  in
our society.

In doing this, I must, from the word go, reiterate  the  importance  of  the
family in any nation. For our  department,  family  support  programmes  are
critical in combating substance abuse. This means that there is a dire  need
for us to develop solid family support and family preservation programmes.

What any government can do, if it wants to intervene, is to insist upon  and
instil in society positive family values. Another key  programme  to  combat
substance abuse is a school-based programme. Research has  shown  that  drug
kingpins target our schools, and our schools must be  centres  for  fighting
substance abuse.

We welcome the initiatives of  the  Department  of  Education  in  launching
programmes  such  as  drug-free  schools  and  intervention  made  with  the
curriculum,  through  life-skills  education.   The   building   of   family
programmes should also be located  within  the  strengthening  of  community
programmes that deal with combating substance abuse.

The department of social services  has  built  strong  community  structures
that are self-sustainable. These structures are critical in coming  up  with
positive programmes that will take young people away from drugs.

Throughout the length  and  breadth  of  South  Africa,  we  have  community
centres that should play the role of implementing programmes aimed  at  drug
and alcohol  abuse.  These  centres  also  create  an  environment  for  the
implementation of another key programme in combating substance  abuse.  This
programme is a youth or peer monitoring programme.

Let me demonstrate the importance of this programme, though  in  a  negative
manner. I will use the thesis of a prison community. This  thesis  maintains
that,  in  a  prison  environment,  criminals  teach  each  other  ways   of
committing crimes without being detected. Experienced criminals, or the  so-
called hardened criminals, turn petty criminals into hardened ones.

The process of  this  teaching  and  turning  around  happens  through  peer
influence in jail. If we turn this thesis into a positive  thing,  it  means
that peers can be employed to transform their peers into better  members  of
society. But then what are the programmes or interventions  that  the  North
West province, through the department of social services, arts, culture  and
sports has implemented?

Allow me to list these without any elaboration, because this  was  rather  a
long presentation.  They  are:  sports  against  drugs  in  connection  with
UNICEF, foster care programmes, victim  employment  programmes,  counselling
services and institutional capacity-building.

Lastly, I would like to  thank  the  NCOP  for  identifying  this  important
topic. [Applause.]

Ms E M COLEMAN (Mpumalanga): Hon Chairperson, it is appropriate  to  express
my appreciation for this opportunity to address the House  on  these  issues
that are of great concern to us.

Drugs are a thorn in the flesh of  the  people  of  our  country.  The  real
tragedy of drugs is that they pronounce certain unprecedented principles  of
life. They  cause  devastating  consequences  for  a  better  nation.  Drugs
manifest themselves in the minds of our people  and  erode  the  life-skills
and technological skills that human nature possesses. If  drugs  affect  our
people, to them, tomorrow is faceless. It is no base for any plan.

Our people continue to be slaves and die as they  live.  Drugs  corrode  the
prospects of the economy which intend to advance the people of our  country.
I therefore call on all the people of this country to stop or to  help  stop
the abuse of drugs. Alcohol, drugs and the abuse  of  other  substances  are
clearly on the increase. In Mpumalanga,  developments  such  as  the  Maputo
Development Corridor and the increased movement of people to  and  from  the
province have led to the increased availability of hard drugs.

We know that those in the age group  between  35  and  45  years  have  been
largely responsible for abuse in the past. The  form  of  abuse  was  mainly
alcohol - and dagga-related. This trend is changing. We are witnessing  more
and more young people being referred  for  drug  treatment  -  young  people
between the ages of 10 and 14 years. Whereas  alcohol  and  dagga  were  the
main substances used, hard drugs, including cocaine and  LSD,  are  becoming
more freely available in areas such as Nelspruit,  Witbank  and  Secunda  in
our province.

Those who cannot afford such substances have resorted to  abusing  over-the-
counter medicines. Unfortunately, our schools have become  the  target.  Our
dealings with the young people  currently  receiving  treatment  show  that,
one, drugs are now more available at some schools; two, not enough is  being
done to educate our children about  drugs  through  the  school  curriculum;
three, parents are not sufficiently aware  of  the  signs  of  abuse;  four,
parents who are not actively involved in the life of the child  and  who  do
not attend school meetings are often the last to know; and,  five,  children
abuse drugs to improve their self-esteem and interaction with their peers.

Thus, digging into the causes of these abuses, we  can,  however,  say  that
there is greater access  to  drugs  partly  because  of  migration  patterns
affecting provinces, especially those provinces bordering  other  countries,
as is the case with Mpumalanga.

The other factors are poverty and unemployment. Although the  use  of  drugs
might be at a lower level in rural areas, the people of our province do  not
escape this deadly tendency.

The  abuse  of  drugs  no  doubt  causes,   among   other   things,   family
disintegration, family violence, prostitution and dropping  out  of  school.
These poison the soul and  scar  the  personality.  Drugs  always  harm  the
person who abuses them more  than  anyone  else.  Medical  science  research
reveals that such physical ailments as cancer  of  the  throat,  oesophagus,
and lungs, stress and TB, are on  occasion  related  to  drug  abuse,  inter
alia.

The danger of this situation continuing, is that the  victim  will  withdraw
completely into himself or herself and become an absolute criminal.  No  one
will be permitted into their lives and they will refuse to be  part  of  the
lives of others. Either they will give up the  struggle  of  life  and  lose
zest for living or at some point attempt to escape by  lifting  their  minds
to a transcendent realm of cold indifference.

They become too unconcerned  to  love  and  too  passionless  to  hate;  too
detached to be selfish and too lifeless to be unselfish; too indifferent  to
experience joy and too cold to experience sorrow. Their eyes do not see  the
beauty of nature. I am raising all these issues to reflect the dangers  that
the people of our country may face if drugs and other  substances  are  left
to a few to deal with.

We have, as a province, two treatment  centres,  namely  the  Themba  Centre
around Piet Retief  and  Swartfontein  in  the  White  River  area.  The  SA
National Council  on  Alcoholism  and  Drug  Dependence  operates  from  the
Witbank  and  Nelspruit  areas   and   offers   community-based   treatment,
prevention and peer education programmes. For the past six  months  we  have
managed to treat about 315 patients in these centres.

We have as a province embarked on a  number  of  programmes  to  fight  this
problem.  Our  social  workers  and  community   volunteers   have   engaged
communities to educate them about the dangers of drugs.

We have, in an area called  Mkobola,  a  community-based  treatment  centre,
which is aimed at assisting the youth and the rest  of  the  community.  The
province has managed to train peer counsellors to educate their peers  about
substance abuse as it is common knowledge that peer group pressure  features
among the causes of drug abuse.

Sanca has also offered learner support programmes to schools  and  teenagers
affected by drug abuse. As a province, we have  identified  and  intensified
the need to deal with this crisis. We have  also  introduced  glue  sniffing
programmes for street children,  effective  learner  support  programmes  in
schools with the active participation of the Department  of  Education,  and
the extension of Swartfontein centre to  accommodate  more  youth  who  need
treatment. At present the centre is able to  admit  seven  at  a  particular
time. We also have job creation, effective skills development  projects  and
life-skills programmes aimed  at  the  youth  and  women,  with  the  active
involvement of the youth in  various  community  activities  and  empowering
parents with the capacity to deal with the problem.

In conclusion, as a department, we need to realise that  the  fight  against
drug abuse needs a  multidisciplinary  approach.  All  roleplayers  must  be
committed to helping fight this evil in our society.  We  must  all  realise
that the power to heal is in all of us. [Applause.]

Mr D M MALATSI (Western Cape): Chairperson, I follow on  the  heels  of  the
MEC from Mpumalanga. Usually when we salute in the  Western  Cape  we  would
say: ``Molo, mhlob'am [Hello, my friend]''.

Participating in this debate  brings  to  mind  many  serious  memories  for
people who  have  experienced  the  effects  of  alchohol  and  drug  abuse.
Yesterday I read in the newspapers about schoolchildren who had gone  on  an
outing in the Northern Province and, when  they  returned,  started  abusing
drugs and liquor in the bus. The teacher who was  chaperoning  the  children
asked the driver to drive to the police station. The driver did so  and  the
police boarded the bus,  whereupon  the  children  stabbed  the  police  and
attempted to take their guns. Another policeman came into the  bus  and  all
of them were assaulted in the bus at the police station by  these  children.
Some of the young girls were dancing naked in the  bus  after  having  drunk
liquor. This appeared in yesterday's newspaper. These  are  the  effects  of
alcohol abuse and drugs in our country today. We have to look at how we  can
address this issue. We should all join hands  and  ask  what  we  should  do
about this scourge that affects all our children.

The abusers are getting younger by the day. They are not getting any  older.
In the past adults used to have alcohol problems, but  today  children  have
both alcohol and drug problems. We should all agree that  the  very  essence
of the word ``abuse'' reflects the negativity and the  lack  of  control  by
way of coping mechanisms. Against this backdrop, we are faced with  bringing
the negative and positive poles together in rebuilding our society.

Abuse of any habit-forming substance at the cost of those near and  dear  to
one puts respect and dignity at peril. Drug abuse  comes  about  when  these
values are threatened or minimised by the constant excessive  use  of  these
harmful substances. They have  an  effect  not  only  on  the  physical  and
pyschological wellbeing of the abuser, but on those located in  his  or  her
immediate surroundings. Here I refer to the family structure.

Abuse is the wrong or harmful use of any  substance,  including  alcohol  or
drugs, by any individual, as the  hon  the  Minister  said  in  his  opening
address. The fabric of society consists of structures that keep  communities
and families firmly together.  In  effect,  alcohol  and  drug  abuse  is  a
phenomenon  that  breaks  down  these  structures  that  keep  families  and
societies together. It takes away the happiness  and  wellbeing  of  people.
Drugs and alcohol are substances that affect the nervous system.

Drug abuse is when a  person  loses  control  over  the  intake  of  harmful
substances that have an effect on the person's  physical  and  psychological
wellbeing. The problem is prevalent when the excessive and  regular  use  of
alcohol gives rise to alcoholism.

Alcoholism is an irreversible illness which cannot be cured,  but  can  only
be controlled by not using alcohol. We all know that  alcoholism  can  never
be turned around, but through treatment a person  can  be  rehabilitated.  A
person will  live  with  alcoholism  for  the  rest  of  his  life,  but  in
sustaining the  effects  of  rehabilitation,  the  individual  has  to  live
without alcohol or be able to resist the urge for alcohol.

A drug is a chemical substance that has an effect on a  person's  brain  and
nervous system. It can help kill pain, and may be  helpful  during  illness,
but is very harmful if it is used or abused over a long period of  time.  We
all know that there are also many people who  are  addicted  to  painkillers
and cough mixtures. It is not only alcohol that causes problems. People  can
be addicted to these substances, and in the long term they may be harmful.

Both alcohol and drugs may be positive  by  nature,  but  they  can  have  a
detrimental effect on  a  person,  and  his  family  life,  if  not  managed
properly. Excessive and continuous use  allows  the  breaking  down  of  the
person's personality and also causes physical harm.  During  this  breakdown
process the person and  his  personality  undergo  a  lot  of  changes.  The
person's attitude changes and he or  she  loses  control  over  his  or  her
emotional stability, and will start  to  act  irresponsibly.  This  normally
leads to the breakdown of marriages and  lives,  family  disintegration  and
criminal behaviour.

Since the early 1990s we in South Africa have seen that there  has  been  an
increase in the number of drugs that are available on the  market.  We  have
new drugs that we have never known.

When I grew up I knew people in the township to be using  dagga,  but  today
it is only one of the many drugs that are available. There  are  many  other
drugs which are being used by children and I really shudder  to  think  what
impact these drugs have on our children.

Our young people are very vulnerable due to the breaking down of the  family
and community fabric. Neither their  families  nor  society  nor  the  state
protects them. However, we all know that we, as Government,  are  doing  our
best to make sure that we do something in this respect. At present a  person
makes his own decisions regarding his life. The state empowers everybody  to
make a choice, but an individual has to take full responsibility for his  or
her behaviour.

If we look at the situation, we discover that there has been a 30%  increase
in the number of people undergoing treatment  for  their  alcohol  and  drug
problems over the last couple of years. What  is  significant  is  that  the
number of people who undergo treatment for alcohol and drugs are  about  the
same.

Before 1990, 75% of all the people that went for treatment were treated  for
alcoholism only. The number of people going for treatment for  drug  problem
issues is on the increase. It is not that fewer people go for treatment  for
alcoholism, but merely that more people are going for drug abuse problems.

Since 1997 the number of people going for drug treatment has  overtaken  the
number of those going for alcoholism here in the Western Cape.  The  numbers
of females and young people are also on the increase. The ages  of  patients
who go for treatment are getting lower. More people younger  than  18  years
are undergoing treatment for their drug problems. In the  past  the  average
age of people who underwent treatment for an abuse  problem  was  37  years.
Today the average age for persons who undergo treatment is 24 years.

The number of female patients who go for treatment has almost  doubled  over
the last four years, and the main reason for this is drug  abuse  and  over-
the-counter medicine usage. More hard drugs  such  as  heroin,  cocaine  and
ecstasy are available in South Africa today. We  all  know  that  drugs  are
also more available in our schools  and  places  of  recreation.  Dagga  and
mandrax are still the main drugs that are used by abusers  and  the  average
age of patients in this regard is 26 years.

However, there has  been  a  steady  decrease  in  the  number  of  patients
receiving treatment for dagga and mandrax-related problems since  1996.  The
situation may be as a result of the fact that more hard drugs are  available
in  the  country.  Very  few  patients  that  abuse  cocaine  are  receiving
treatment at this point in time, but this will  increase  in  the  years  to
come. It does not mean that cocaine is not available  and  that  people  are
not using it, as people who abuse it are making telephonic  enquiries  about
their problem.

Young people at raves see ecstasy as a secondary substance of abuse. We  all
know how many young people are dying as a result of  taking  the  rave  drug
ecstasy. The rave drugs are gaining social recognition,  especially  amongst
our youth, and this can be viewed as a contributory factor.

More than 50% of people who go for inpatient  alcohol  abuse  treatment  are
married. About 60% of patients who undergo drug abuse treatment are  single.
Most of those who are treated for their drug abuse problems are  unemployed.
In this regard one supposes that  the  abuse  was  maintained  by  means  of
criminal behaviour. Drugs and crime go mostly hand in hand  and,  therefore,
in areas where the abuse of drugs is prevalent, a high crime  rate  will  be
prevalent as well.

Drug trafficking in South Africa has been on the increase since the  country
became an integral part of the world. It was impossible to escape from  this
phenomenon as we became part and parcel  of  the  international  world.  Our
crime rate increased to  alarming  proportions,  especially  when  organised
crime came to this country. Crime, gangs and drugs  have  almost  taken  the
fabric of society apart.

However, as the department of social services in the Western  Cape,  we  are
doing something in this regard. The department of social services manages  a
treatment centre for adults and one for youth at De  Novo  in  Kraaifontein.
At the adult centre 60 male and 20 female  patients  receive  treatment  for
drug abuse problems. At the youth centre children between  the  ages  of  12
and 18 are receiving treatment also for drug abuse  problems,  not  alcohol.
[Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: You do not have it in Khayelitsha.

Mr D M MALATSI (Western Cape): About R12 million is budgeted  per  annum  to
run these two centres. I mean we  no  longer  discriminate.  The  people  of
Khayelitsha  also  send  their  patients  to  De  Novo  and  other   places.
[Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: How to do they get there?

Mr D M MALATSI (Western Cape): We provide transport. The hon  member  should
not worry. [Interjections.]

This department also  subsidises  four  private  treatment  centres  in  the
Western Cape province at a  cost  of  R3,3  million  per  annum.  All  these
treatment  centres  cater  for  both  sexes.  There  are  also  four   other
registered treatment centres in this province, but they are  not  subsidised
by the department as the patients pay for their own treatment.

We have to look at possible solutions to the  problems.  Firstly,  we  would
like to look  at  the  situation  where  we  have  outreach  programmes  for
vulnerable groups. Vulnerable and high-risk groups  must  be  identified  in
this country. Programmes must be designed to meet their needs  and  to  help
them overcome their problems. Children, the youth and young females must  be
helped and protected against ruthless drug smugglers and drug peddlers.

Awareness-raising and prevention through the mass media are very  important.
The media can create an awareness  of  the  problems  arising  out  of  drug
abuse. Journalists must be sensitised and trained to report on  this  topic.
In the media reporting today is often about  sensation  and  not  about  the
awareness of drug control and prevention of the problem.
I think the Minister will agree with me that if one were to ask a  newspaper
to write a story about  preventative  methods  of  avoiding  problems,  they
would want one to take out an advertisement in the newspaper. When  a  crime
is committed by a drug addict they will print  it  with  headlines  free  of
charge. However, when one wants to talk about education and prevention  they
want one to pay for that. I think we need to  sensitise  the  newspapers  to
also take a social responsibility in this respect. Stories  about  the  drug
lords' violence and police seizures are what  we  see  every  day,  free  of
charge, in the R2 newspapers. But we,  as  the  department  and  Government,
must pay to sensitise the people  about  the  dangers  of  living  in  drug-
infested areas. The situation is very seldom adequately analysed.

With regard to the legal  framework,  we  all  know  that  drug  trafficking
between countries must be controlled and therefore a  legal  framework  must
be  developed  to  assist  with  the  extradition   arrangements   of   drug
traffickers. A regional legal framework must be developed. South Africa  has
become a haven for drug peddlers because they know that  if  they  are  here
they will not be extradited to other countries if they are ever found.  They
can buy their way out of  the  correctional  services  prisons  of  Minister
Skosana.

The police must earn the trust of the people and  the  people  must  rebuild
their trust so that communities and volunteers  inform  them  about  illegal
activities. We all know that the social fabric of our families  and  family-
community ties should be strengthened so that people can feel safe and  make
the right choices in life. People must learn to trust each other  and  moral
standards and  values  must  be  restored.  Churches  and  schools  must  be
involved in this respect.

In conclusion, I would like to say that we all know that  the  Western  Cape
has a history of the dop system, by which people  were  paid  with  alcohol.
Today we live with the consequences of such a system, in that  we  have  the
fetal alcohol syndrome. Some of these children are going to school  burdened
by a problem of the past. So we must, as  the  department,  have  sufficient
resources  at  our  disposal  to  impact  on  and  be  able  to  assist  the
communities that we see in this area. [Time expired.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister of Social Development  Dr  Z  S  T
Skweyiya, hon members, I am  really  wondering  if  the  hon  MEC  from  the
Western Cape has not exaggerated the situation  in  the  Northern  Province.
[Laughter.]

Lava va vulavulaka xilungu va ri [In English they say]: ``Charity begins  at
home.''

It is mostly in the home situation  where  drugs  and  alcohol  are  abused.
Then, the abusers are related to us in one way or the other.

Swi nga va swi hi kongoma kumbe swi nga hi kongomi. Kutani loko hi  vulavula
swi lava hi swi tiva leswaku hi maxaka ya vanhu. [We  may  be  concerned  or
perhaps not. When we speak we must be aware that we  are  related  to  other
people.]

We are faced with the challenging and escalating problem  of  alcohol  abuse
in our country which has affected and is continuing to affect the  fibre  of
our society. The statistics, as my colleague, the  hon  chairperson  of  the
committee, has stated, are self-evident and they speak for themselves.

This is not a problem that exists only in South Africa but  it  also  exists
globally in societies more advanced than the others. I would like  to  quote
the Secretary-General of the UN, Mr Kofi Annan, when he said:


  Globalisation  offers  the  human   race   unprecedented   opportunities.
  Unfortunately, it also  enables  many  antisocial  activities  to  become
  problems without passports.

Among these is alcohol abuse, which brings misery to  millions  of  families
around the world every year.

Family disruption, weak family relationships, criminality and alcohol  abuse
of siblings, inconsistent enforcement of rules and  norms,  and  inefficient
supervision have been identified as  critical  factors  resulting  from  the
abuse of alcohol and critical predisposing factors for later problems.

As with most health and social problems, alcohol abuse rarely has  a  single
cause.  Research  has  identified  a  set  of  factors  which  increase   an
individual's  risk  of  abusing  alcohol.  These  factors  are  complex  and
constantly changing at individual, community and societal levels.

While some of them are universal, like curiosity,  boredom  and  loneliness,
others are more specific, and the mix and weight of factors will  vary  from
person to person and from community  to  community.  The  reason  behind  an
individual's abuse of alcohol has been recognised to  be  the  result  of  a
complex  interaction  with  individual,  family,  social  and  environmental
factors, as well as factors related to genetics, biology and personality.

My main focus today will be on the effect of  alcohol  abuse  on  women  and
children. One  might  ask  the  question:  Why  specifically  on  women  and
children? I am here as a mother and a representative of women. What  we  are
saying is that our children are the future of this  country.  They  are  the
leaders of tomorrow.

When problems and circumstances  like  parental  alcoholism  interfere  with
family functioning, the effects on children can sometimes linger long  after
these children have grown up. If their souls  and  minds  are  destroyed  or
crushed today what will become of them  tomorrow?  If  alcohol  crushes  the
souls and the esteem of the mothers, what will  become  of  them  and  their
children whom they will have to raise?

While not ignoring the role of men, in most cultures mothers play  a  bigger
role in grooming and shaping the lives of the children.  What  happens  then
if the father abuses alcohol; and what impact will it have  on  the  family,
specifically mother and child? What will happen if a mother abuses alcohol?
Let me start by defining an alcoholic. An alcoholic is identified by  severe
dependence or addiction and a cumulative  pattern  of  behaviour  associated
with  drinking.  Frequent  intoxication  is  obvious  and  destructive.   It
interferes with the individual's ability to socialise and work.  Drunkenness
may lead to marriage failure and, eventually,  when  absenteeism  from  work
becomes intolerable, may result in a worker being fired.

We have a number of accidents on the road that are  the  result  of  driving
under the influence of  liquor  or  alcohol.  Research  shows  that  factors
leading to increased use, habituation or addiction  include  peer  or  group
pressure,  emotional  distress,  low  self-esteem,  social  alienation   and
environmental stress, particularly if accompanied by feelings  of  impotence
regarding the ability to effect change or accomplish goals.

The incidence of alcoholism among women, children, adolescents  and  college
students is increasing in many countries, our country included.  This  is  a
direct  consequence   of   the   above-mentioned   tendencies,   which   are
multifactorial, and range from the physical  to  the  psychological,  social
and economic situation.

In South Africa there has been an increase in the rate of the abuse of  both
women and children as a  direct  result  of  alcoholism  in  the  family.  A
significant proportion of spousal physical abuse can be linked to  excessive
alcohol intake. This creates a certain kind  of  environment  in  which  the
mother and child  find  themselves  on  the  receiving  end.  This  kind  of
environment is detrimental to the  healthy  development  of  the  child  and
diminishes the self-esteem of the mother. In other words, it  has  a  direct
psychological effect.

Research also shows that children who grow up under such  circumstances  end
up being abusive themselves, drop out of school, underperform at school,  or
become dysfunctional socially and  psychologically.  The  list  is  endless.
These consequences have far-reaching effects, not only for  the  family  but
for the community and society as a whole.

The question is: What kind of adult will this child become? This will be  an
adult with low self-esteem,  without  education,  most  likely  without  any
skill and potentially unemployable. The  child  will  find  himself  finding
other means to  survive,  including  finding  solace  in  alcohol  and  most
commonly being involved in  crime.  In  this  way  he  ends  up  becoming  a
jailbird, consuming more than R100 daily in jail.

The entire generational transmission of alcohol  addiction  is  one  of  the
most devastating effects of the enduring legacy of alcoholism. Children  who
grow up under such circumstances grow up to become like  their  parents  and
impose their ways on their children, thus triggering  a  never-ending  cycle
of alcohol abuse. That is why hi pfa hi  vula  hi  ku  [at  times  we  say]:
``Like father like son.'' [Interjections.]

The economic implications are enormous. A lot of people  who  abuse  alcohol
tend to spend most of their income on alcohol, thus neglecting their  family
responsibilities.  Loss  of  income  creates  financial  difficulty  in  the
family, resulting in  inadequacy  or  scarcity  of  basic  resources.  [Time

Ms E C GOUWS: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs and hon members ...

... as ons na die toekoms van  ons  land  kyk,  kyk  ons  onomwonde  na  die
gehalte van ons jeug. Dit is mos in die hande van vandag se  jeug  wat  m√¥re
se  toekoms  l√™.  Al  sou  ons  daarin  slaag  om  die  mees   doeltreffende
onderwysstelsel op die been te bring; al sou ons  die  beste  veiligheid  en
sekuriteitsmaatre√´ls h√™;  al  sou  ons  slaag  met  'n  uitstekende  sosiale
ontwikkelingsprogram; al sou ons die doeltreffendste  gesondheidsdienste  en
anti-vigs programme h√™, alles sal vergeefs wees as ons nie  die  kanker  van
alkohol en dwelmmisbruik onder beheer kry nie.

'n Verslaafde verloor selfrespek, selfdissipline en etiese waardes  want  so
'n persoon is nie in beheer van sy liggaam en denke nie.  'n  Verslaafde  of
dwelmafhanklike kan nie rasioneel dink nie. 'n  Verslaafde  kan  nie  beplan
nie. 'n Verslaafde verloor empatie met sy naaste. Ons land  se  toekoms  kan
nie vertrou word in die  hande  van  verslaafdes  of  dwelmafhanklikes  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[... when we look at the future of our country,  we  unequivocally  look  at
the quality of our youth. Tomorrow's future lies in  the  hands  of  today's
youth. Even  if  we  should  succeed  in  establishing  the  most  efficient
education system; even if we  should  have  the  best  safety  and  security
measures in place; even if we should  succeed  with  an  outstanding  social
development programme; even if we should  have  the  most  efficient  health
services and anti-Aids programmes, everything would be in vain if we do  not
get the cancer of alcohol and drug abuse under control.

An addict loses self-respect, self-discipline and  ethical  values,  because
such a person is not in control of his body and thoughts. An addict or drug-
dependent cannot think rationally. An addict cannot plan.  An  addict  loses
empathy for his fellow man. Our country's future cannot be entrusted in  the
hands of addicts or drug-dependants.]

According to a study conducted on almost 1 000 people arrested by police  in
Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban, 49%  of  them  tested  positive  for  at
least one drug. A scary finding indeed!

Let us turn to drugs and our children. In May 2001 a  survey  was  conducted
and 138 primary  school  children  and  4  634  high  school  children  were
involved. The statistics  show  that  46%  of  Grade  7  children,  that  is
Standard 5, smoked or experimented with cigarettes; 86% of Grade 7  children
have experimented with alcohol; and 26% of those questioned say  drugs  such
as mandrax have been offered to them.

In the high school 30% of all pupils are smokers; 56%  drink  five  or  more
drinks at a time, once a month or more often than  that.  The  survey  shows
that out of  400  Grade  12  pupils,  35%  have  tried  dagga  and  6%  have
experimented with ecstasy and 5% with Mandrax. Thirty-three percent  of  the
1 537 pupils questioned  admitted  their  families  have  drug  and  alcohol
problems.

In conclusion, we can say that by the  time  they  finish  high  school  all
teenagers  will  have  been  exposed  to  drugs  in  one  form  or   another
irrespective of where they come from, what school they go to or  how  bright
they are. We can help avoid the horrors of addiction by being informed.  One
should look out for signs like: Why do young people  take  drugs?  It  feels
good to get stoned, it is cool, boredom, curiosity,  pressure  from  friends
and an escape from problems.

Tobacco, one of the most lawful drugs and the most abused, and  alcohol  are
the most easily accessible. Alcohol is part of our culture  -  champagne  to
celebrate, brandy for shock,  a  hot  toddy  for  flu.  [Laughter.]  Alcohol
causes a huge amount of harm and physical damage in a  society,  yet  it  is
socially acceptable and freely available. [Interjections.]

Rev M CHABAKU: Boereraat! [Home remedies!]
Ms E C GOUWS: Most of our family violence is caused through  alcohol-related
incidents, as are traffic accidents.

South Africa has the  highest  incidence  in  the  world  of  fetal  alcohol
syndrome, 20 times higher than the worst statistics elsewhere in the  world.
Binge drinking is common amongst  young  people,  and  is  cause  for  great
concern because of the accompanying  high-risk  behaviours  such  as  unsafe
sex, violence and  car  accidents,  health  problems  and  the  priority  of
dependence.

Ons  kan  voortgaan  om  al  die  negatiewe  uitvloeisels   van   drank   en
dwelmverslawing op ons samelewing op te  noem  -  misdaad,  moord,  HIV/Vigs
verspreiding, familiekonflikte - die lys is bykans onbeperk. Byna alles  kan
toegeskryf word aan hierdie euwel.

Kom ons begin deur, eerstens, na ons jeug om  te  sien.  Kom  ons  verstewig
weer ons gesins- en familiebande en  wys  vir  mekaar  dat  ons  vir  mekaar
omgee. Dit is mense wat verwerp voel en mense wat na liefde smag, wat  hulle
wend tot drank en dwelms  om  van  die  werklikheid  te  ontsnap  en  in  'n
kunsmatige w√™reld voort te ploeter. Die euwel van verslawing het  'n  enorme
sosiale probleem in ons land geword. Ons as  'n  nasie  het  te  veel  begin
konsentreer op fisiese  verryking  en  welvaart  en  in  die  proses  soveel
ingeboet aan vriendskap, kameraadskap  en  familiebande.  Hierdie  negatiewe
invloed op die samelewing dryf  die  eensames,  die  verwaarloosdes  en  die
rigtingloses na 'n kunsmatige w√™reld en 'n  lewe  van  kunsmatige  genot  en
sukses. Daar is werk vir ons. Ons moet wakker word en dit moet  begin,  waar
alles begin, naamlik in die  gesin.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[We can continue mentioning all the negative  consequences  of  alcohol  and
drug addiction on our society - crime, murder, the  spreading  of  HIV/Aids,
family conflicts - the list is almost unlimited. Nearly  everything  can  be
ascribed to this evil.

Let us start, firstly, by caring  for  our  youth.  Let  us  strengthen  our
family ties and let us show one  another  that  we  care.  People  who  feel
rejected and who yearn for love turn to alcohol  and  drugs  to  escape  the
reality and plod on in an  artificial  world.  The  evil  of  addiction  has
become an enormous social problem in our country.  We,  as  a  nation,  have
started to concentrate too much on physical enrichment  and  prosperity  and
in the process we  have  lost  so  much  in  the  way  of  friendship,  good
fellowship and family ties. This negative influence  on  our  society  urges
the lonely people, the neglected people and the ones  without  direction  to
an artificial world and a life of artificial pleasure and success. There  is
work set out for us. We should wake up and it should start where  everything
else starts, namely, in the family. [Applause.]]

Ms N C KONDLO (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, hon Minister and colleagues,  let
me take the opportunity of thanking the NCOP for having invited the  Eastern
Cape to this important debate.

The effect of drug abuse and alcohol can never  be  overemphasised.  It  was
well captured by the former President of South Africa,  Dr  Nelson  Mandela,
when he said in the National Drug Master Plan that  our  country  was  faced
with a growing problem of substance abuse.  This  has  serious  implications
for  millions  of  citizens,  because  it  contributes  to  crime,  domestic
violence, family disintegration and other  social  problems.  This  reflects
the seriousness that we are faced with and the serious  challenges  that  we
have to deal with as a country.

The current trends as we speak on alcohol and drug abuse  indicate  that  we
will lose one third of our generation in the  few  years  to  come  to  drug
abuse. Young people are experimenting at a much  earlier  age  than  before,
even as early as 8 years of age. The gateway drug that most use  is  tobacco
and in some instances they experiment with  more  than  one  drug,  such  as
alcohol, tobacco or glue.

Sixty per cent of our teenagers will experiment with  drugs  or  alcohol  at
school, where they believe it is very safe to do drugs because  they  cannot
be easily caught. These current trends also indicate that 90% of  those  who
abuse drugs purchase them from peers in the same schools.
These trends also indicate that adults can  become  physically  addicted  to
alcohol  within  5  to  15  years.  Children,  especially  adolescents,  get
addicted  as  soon  as  between  the  periods  of  5  and  15   months   and
preadolescent children become addicts as early as between 5  and  15  weeks.
The age problem, as was indicated earlier here, is that it is not the  older
but rather the younger children for whom it is easier to become addicts.

Lastly, on the current trends of alcohol and drug  abuse,  it  is  indicated
that  20%  of  teenagers  get  involved  in  accidents  and  commit  suicide
precisely because of their abuse of alcohol and drugs.

Let us look at the effects of  drug  abuse  and  alcohol  abuse.  These  are
experimented with and experienced in our homes and our families,  at  school
and in the workplace.

We will just briefly touch on some of these effects that  alcohol  and  drug
abuse have on families. One finds that relationships get strained. There  is
disharmony in families and, at the end of  the  day,  we  experience  family
breakdowns. If  one  goes  to  the  workplaces,  one  finds  that  there  is
diminished work performance, which  has  serious  implications  for  service
delivery. There is a high rate of absenteeism and at  the  end  of  the  day
people get unemployed and this will have an impact and  a  burden,  both  on
families and on our social welfare system. The effect of  alcohol  abuse  on
crime has resulted in most of the accidents.

Statistics indicate that 2% of road accidents are the result of drug  and/or
alcohol  abuse.  Organised  crime  such   as   gangsterism,   illegal   drug
trafficking, property crimes, crimes against persons and/or prostitution  is
a result of abusers being engaged in such activities, because  they  do  not
want or see the need to break the habit.

Let us look at what our province does as a  way  of  trying  to  combat  the
abuse of alcohol and/or drugs. Guided by the  Prevention  and  Treatment  of
Drug Dependency Act of 1992 we, as a province, are engaged in  a  number  of
programmes geared towards  prevention  and  intervention.  We  have  several
youth organisations which render preventative and  counselling  services  to
young people. It is believed that peer  counselling  and  training  are  the
most effective ways of dealing with drug addicts.

We have Teenagers against Drug Abuse, or Tada, Youth for  Christ  and  Tough
Love. All these are young people's organisations which, in partnership  with
the provincial department, assist in fighting the problem of drug abuse.  We
also work very closely with NGOs such as  Sanca  and  Life  Line  which  are
involved  in  both  inpatient  and  outpatient  treatment  programmes.   The
programmes focus on detoxification.

We have three major  rehabilitation  centres  which  use  these  programmes.
However, as a province  we  are  of  the  opinion  that  the  detoxification
programme is not the best practice. We have found that there is a  trend  of
relapse during the period of detoxification and therefore  we  think  it  is
not the best form of treatment.

We believe that the relevant  departments,  both  provincial  and  national,
should follow a collaborative and co-ordinated approach, that this  approach
should  also  be  followed  at  local  government  level  where  all   these
departments  can  work  together  to  ensure  a  long-term  and  sustainable
intervention programme to strengthen activities  at  the  level  of  primary
health care, that there should be stricter  legislative  changes  addressing
the problem of drinking and driving and that there  should  be  intervention
at  the  workplace  addressing  alcohol  abuse.  The  latter  involves   the
employment assistance programme.

We also believe that there ought to be more education  programmes  aimed  at
high-risk groups such as teenagers, pregnant women, workers  and  employers.
There is also a need for the development of an  effective  policy  regarding
drugs in schools.

Our province also feels that there should be a lot of  education  programmes
aimed at the community at large,  like  the  example  mentioned  here  about
media advocacy.
From the strategic interventions concerning alcohol and/or  substance  abuse
that I have mentioned, it is clear that,  if  we  were  to  engage  in  such
activities, we could make a big  difference.  It  also  indicates  that  the
treatment of alcohol and/or drug abuse is not the  monopoly  or  prerogative
of a single department. We should rather function as a team and should  thus
be able to deal with the problems.

I also want to touch on some of the issues that we  as  a  province  believe
should be focused on if we want to work harder.  The  fast-tracking  of  the
amendments to the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Dependency  Act  of  1992
will go a long way in assisting the national  drug  authority  envisaged  in
the National Drug Master Plan. We also  believe  that  if  these  amendments
could be fast-tracked, the implementation of the National Drug  Master  Plan
will go a long way in dealing with the  problems  that  we  are  faced  with
today.

Fourthly, the authority envisaged in the plan can only operate and  work  if
there is a legislative framework within which it has  to  operate,  because,
as it stands, the legislation does not recognise the authority as  envisaged
in the national draft master plan.

Lastly,  we  believe  that  stricter  measures  in  terms  of  the  existing
legislation will also assist in dealing  with  drug  abuse,  and  especially
alcohol abuse, because it is no strange thing for Oom Piet to send  Mary  to
buy alcohol at the shebeen next door precisely because it is not illegal  to
buy and also to have alcohol. At the same time, ...

... xa uTata uDlamini ethuma intombi yakhe  encinci  ukuba  iye  kumthengela
ibhotile yebhranti, loo nto ayibonakali njengokwaphula umthetho.  [...  when
Mr Dlamini asks his daughter to go and buy him a bottle of brandy,  that  is
not seen as breaking the law.]

Therefore we are saying that stricter measures, especially  as  they  relate
to carrying and buying, as well as regulation of the  escalating  number  of
shebeens that are mushrooming in our communities, will also go  a  long  way
in dealing with this.  At  the  same  time  we  have  to  go  out  there  to
communities, because the ignorance about substance abuse in our  communities
leaves a lot to be desired.

By so doing, we would, in the words of the President,  ``be  able  to  stand
together against drugs to make South Africa a better and a  safer  place  to
live in''. [Applause.]

Ms R N NDZUTA (Gauteng): Chairperson, hon Minister,  members  of  the  NCOP,
ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased and honoured to  be  given  a  small
role in the much-needed initiative that is being debated here today.

I am indeed very glad to be able to play a role in  discussing  the  effects
of  substance  abuse  in  our  society.  This  debate  coincides  with   our
department's launch of the Gauteng Substance Abuse Forum earlier this  year.
It is an important initiative  to  help  our  nation  address  this  serious
problem. Therefore, I consider myself privileged to be  in  the  company  of
men and women who have made the rebuilding of their country the  theatre  of
their operation.

One of the greatest tragedies of apartheid was its neglect of  the  majority
of our children  and  the  youth.  It  hindered  the  development  of  their
potential to contribute to the community  and  the  nation,  and  many  were
pushed to the margins of society, and yet our youth are our future.

In the overview of drug and alcohol abuse, we find  that  alcohol  is  still
the dominant substance of abuse with  a  major  impact  on  communities  and
individuals. It contributes extensively to the level of  violence,  traffic-
related trauma and neglect of children, as well as their abuse and  that  of
women.

The use of marijuana, pat(s)he, intsangu, or dagga as it is commonly  known,
is on the increase. This is according  to  the  number  of  arrests.  It  is
contributing to the high level of crime,  especially  mugging  and  possible
rape.
The use of Mandrax is high among the persons arrested for a range of  crimes
across sites. It is said that 60% of people arrested  on  drug  and  alcohol
charges or for housebreaking tested positive  for  cannabis,  while  over  a
third tested positive for Mandrax.

According to the Central Drug Authority's statistics of 1996, alcohol  abuse
cost the country R10,6¬†billion, while the cost of narcotic  abuse  has  been
estimated at between R2,5¬†billion and R7,1 billion. However,  the  trail  of
misery can never be quantified.

It is within this context that our department has redesigned  its  financing
policy towards treatment centres. However, within the  same  scope  we  have
moved to transform the centres from being  lily-white  to  representing  the
population of our country. The support we have received from  these  centres
indeed positions us to meet the challenges faced  by  victims  of  substance
abuse.

By combining education and prevention, and by working  in  our  schools  and
among young people who are unemployed or in prison, our department  and  the
Gauteng Substance Abuse Forum will indeed bring the light of  hope  to  help
break the darkness that feeds the ranks of criminals.

The forum, we believe, will add  strength  to  our  efforts  to  change  the
culture of violence that pervades our society and, in particular,  too  many
schools  and  homes  where  young  people  learn  the  values   that   guide
them.[Interjections.] The 26th of June is known worldwide as  the  day  that
focuses on drug abuse awareness. This year the United Nations  has  declared
that the focus is on sport against crime. This cements our partnership  with
sportspeople to combat the abuse of  drugs.  As  role  models,  sportspeople
should live a clean life. We thus call upon our sportspeople to join  us  as
we prepare an onslaught against drugs on the sportsfield.

We are determined to ensure that  our  sporting  codes  depend  on  courage,
commitment and hard work, and not on drugs. To our  youth  we  say:  ``Seize
the opportunities that this forum brings and take your place  as  tomorrow's
leaders in rebuilding society.'' When launching  the  National  Drug  Master
Plan, former President, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, declared that  we  should
not underestimate the scale of this challenge. However, it is his wish  that
every one of us implements the National Drug Master  Plan  so  that  we  can
together eradicate the drug problem in South Africa.

I am glad to say that today's debate advances our role in  implementing  the
National Drug Master Plan in Gauteng and in our country in general.

Let us join hands to break the momentum of crime and  substance  abuse,  and
make South Africa a better and safer place to live in. Faranani!  Supporting
each other. [Applause.]

Mev J WITBOOI: Agb Voorsitter, agb Minister en agb lede,  ``Hy  lieg  mos.''
Hierdie is die woorde van 'n jong kind wat honger en verslae is. Dit is  die
woorde van 'n kind wat teleurgesteld is in 'n pa wat vroeg  die  oggend  uit
die huis is met die laaste paar rand in sy sak, met die belofte  om  kos  te
gaan koop. Lank na donker slinger hy dronk die huis in met geen kos vir  die
gesin nie. Toe hy later deur sy vrou daaroor gekonfronteer word, het hy  ten
aanhore van sy kinders aan haar ges√™ dat hy die geld verloor  het.  Nodeloos
om te s√™ dat hierdie gesin daardie aand ook sonder kos  gaan  slaap  het  en
dat die kinders die volgende oggend honger op die skoolbanke moes gaan sit.

``Ek was nie so dronk nie.'' Verwilderd en tot  nugterheid  geskok,  is  dit
die eerste reaksie van 99,9% van besope bestuurders wanneer hulle  roekelose
en nalatige optrede noodlottige gevolge  het.  Selfverwyt  en  vingerwys  na
vriende wat toegelaat het dat hy  of  sy  'n  laaste  drankie  voor  vertrek
geneem het, baat dan niks. Niemand kan die onskuldige, lewelose liggame  aan
hul geliefdes terugbesorg nie. Niemand kan aan die  magtelose  verslaentheid
van die familie van die skuldige iets doen nie.

Die  pynlike  rimpeleffek  van  hierdie  alledaagse  gebeurlikhede  in   ons
samelewing is enorm. Niemand word hiervan gevrywaar nie.  Op  een  of  ander
manier  val  ons  almal  dit  ten  prooi.  'n  Studie  van   1999   in   ses
staatshospitale onthul  dat  74%  van  alle  geweldsmisdade,  54%  van  alle
verkeersbotsings en 42% van alle traumagevalle  alkoholverwant  was.  Ek  is
seker in 100% van die gevalle l√™ verflenterde gemeenskappe en bloei, en  die
refrein eggo voort: ``Ek was nie so dronk nie.''

Alkohol- en dwelmverbruikers erken nie maklik hul swakhede  nie.  Hulle  wil
ook nie behandel word nie. Ons sosiale projekte misluk soms omdat hulle  nie
uit eie wil gehelp wil word nie. Ons moet hulle hande vat en help. ``Ag,  as
ek maar net geweet het.'' 'n Uittreksel uit Om die Waarheid te s√™  van  A  G
Visser lei soos volg:


  Kyk, dokter, bietjie na my keel. Kan jy daar niks bespeur?
  Jy kan jou seker nie verbeel drie plase is daardeur.

[Gelag.] Ek is seker dat die vermelde persoon baie dae moes ges√™ het:  ``Ag,
as ek maar net geweet het.''

Hoeveel, vandag sieklike, senior burgers dink nie  selfverwytend  terug  aan
'n roekelose jeug, en s√™: ``As ek maar net geweet het'' nie? Om te  oordeel,
en om te veroordeel, sal ons vandag niks baat nie. Ons  moet  hande  vat  om
die siekte in ons gemeenskappe die hoof te bied. Die  gevolge  van  alkohol-
en dwelmmisbruik is te groot om te ignoreer. Ons moet ons jeug, ons  moeders
en ons vaders red. Ons kan nou 'n bydrae lewer sodat  ons  nie  eendag  hoef
terug te kyk en te s√™: ``Ag, het  ons  maar  net  geweet''  nie.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mrs J WITBOOI: Hon Chairman, hon Minister and  hon  members,  ``But  he  is
lying''. These are the words of  a  young  child  who  is  hungry  and  low-
spirited. These are the words of a child who is  disappointed  in  a  father
who left the house early in the morning with  the  last  few  rands  in  his
pocket, promising to go and buy food. Long after dark  he  reeled  into  the
house drunkenly, without any food  for  the  family.  When  his  wife  later
confronted him about it, he told her within earshot of his children that  he
had lost the money. Needless to say, the family again went  to  bed  without
food and the children had to sit in  the  school  benches  hungry  the  next
morning.

``I was not that drunk.'' Haggard and shocked into  sobriety,  this  is  the
first reaction of 99,9% of  intoxicated  drivers  when  their  reckless  and
negligent  behaviour  has  fatal  consequences.  Self-reproach  and  finger-
pointing at friends who allowed him or her to have a last drink before  they
left are to no avail then. No one can restore the innocent, lifeless  bodies
to their loved ones. No one can do anything about  the  helpless  dismay  of
the family of the guilty party.

The painful ripple effect  of  these  everyday  events  in  our  society  is
enormous. No one is exempt from this. In some or other way all  of  us  fall
prey to it. A study in six state hospitals in 1999 showed that  74%  of  all
crimes of violence, 54% of all traffic  accidents  and  42%  of  all  trauma
cases were related to alcohol. I am certain that  in  100%  of  those  cases
torn communities were bleeding, and the refrain echoes on: ``I was not  that
drunk.''

Alcohol and drug abusers do not easily admit their weaknesses. Nor  do  they
want to be treated. Our social projects sometimes fail, because they do  not
want to be helped of their own accord. We must take  their  hands  and  help
them. ``Oh, if only I had known.'' An excerpt from Om die Waarheid te s√™  by
A G Visser goes as follows:


  Kyk, dokter, bietjie na my keel. Kan jy daar niks  bespeur?  Jy  kan  jou
  seker nie verbeel drie plase is daardeur.

[Laughter.] I am sure that the  person  in  question  must  have  said  many
times: ``Oh, if only I had known.''

How many senior citizens, today infirm, do not cast their minds  back  to  a
reckless youth, and say: ``If only I had known.'' To judge, and to  condemn,
will not serve any useful purpose. We must join hands to combat the  disease
in our communities. The consequences of  alcohol  and  drug  abuse  are  too
great to ignore. We must rescue our youth, our mothers and our  fathers.  We
can make a contribution now so that one day we do not have to look back  and
say: ``Oh, if only we had known.'' [Applause.]]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, hon  members  and  Minister,  the  process  of
democratic transformation in  our  country  is  offering  our  young  people
unprecedented opportunities. Unfortunately, it has also opened the  door  to
many antisocial activities among our youth. Chief among these are drugs  and
alcohol abuse  which  bring  misery  to  thousands  of  families,  and  drug
trafficking  which  cynically  promotes  and  exploits   that   misery   for
commercial gain.

There can be no doubt that the increase in the  use  of  drugs  among  young
people is primarily the result of an increase in trafficking  of  drugs  and
the difficulties experienced by our police in  preventing  drug  traffickers
from bringing large quantities of drugs into our country and communities.

Why is the fight against drug trafficking  so  important?  Drug  trafficking
has become a global phenomenon, which makes  it  difficult  for  any  single
country, its government and its police to fight it effectively on its own.

Moreover, the success of  other  countries  in  combating  drug  trafficking
poses an increased threat to our own country as drug traffickers  are  being
forced to find alternative markets, such as our own. Their efforts  to  gain
a foothold in our own country have been helped  by  our  reintegration  into
the international  community  and  the  modern  transportation  and  banking
infrastructure, which have made it easy  for  drug  traffickers  to  launder
money derived from trafficking.

The fight against  drug  trafficking  is  also  important  in  reducing  the
negative effects of drug  abuse  on  our  social  fabric.  The  increase  in
trafficking of drugs means an increase in  the  number  of  social  problems
associated with drug abuse, such as an increase  in  the  number  of  school
dropouts, premature deaths and the risk of exposure  to  HIV/Aids.  It  also
means that an increased amount of money, which  could  otherwise  have  been
spent on the improvement of other health services, will have to be spent  on
the treatment of drug-related illnesses.

Drugs have been shown to have a number  of  relationships  to  crime.  These
include driving under the influence of alcohol or  drugs,  crimes  committed
under the influence of alcohol or drugs, crimes committed in  order  to  get
money or  goods  to  sell  for  this  purpose,  to  buy  drugs,  and  crimes
associated  with  drug  distribution,  such   as   intergang   warfare   and
vigilantism.

Studies  on  relationships  between  alcohol,  drugs  and  violence  in  the
Northern Cape, for example, where I come from, have shown that  alcohol  and
drugs are major factors in many of the violent crimes that are committed  in
the province, such as assault, rape and domestic violence.  A  recent  study
by the Medical Research Council,  in  conjunction  with  the  Institute  for
Security Studies, confirmed this relationship between drugs  and  crime.  It
found that 50% or more of persons  arrested  for  housebreaking,  theft  and
rape tested positive for at least one drug.

The struggle against drug and alcohol abuse  cannot  be  isolated  from  the
broader struggle to improve the quality of  life  of  our  people.  This  is
because drug and alcohol abuse stem directly  from  the  social  destruction
caused by our apartheid past. [Interjections.] It is true. For  decades  our
people have been condemned to live in  conditions  of  squalor  and  extreme
poverty. These conditions have created fertile  ground  for  drug  lords  to
influence and target our youth through the promise  of  quick  money,  fancy
cars and expensive clothes. Even more worrying is the fact that  drug  lords
are increasingly fanning out to our rural areas where apartheid's legacy  of
unemployment and poverty are most acutely felt.

It is not that our police are not committed to fighting this evil  onslaught
by drug barons.  Indeed,  the  police  have  made  significant  inroads  and
regularly seize large quantities of drugs at our  national  airports,  other
ports of entry and shebeens. During the  year  2000,  the  Narcotics  Bureau
seized more than 30 000 000 kg of dagga, more than 700  000  kg  of  Mandrax
and 129 000 grams of cocaine in  the  Cape  Town,  Durban,  Port  Elizabeth,
Gauteng and Mpumalanga areas.

If one takes into consideration that 460 kg of Mandrax amounts  to  920  000
tablets, the number of Mandrax tablets seized is enormous.  The  success  of
the police may partially explain the renewed gang warfare that  has  erupted
in the Western Cape, where Mandrax is the main addictive drug that is  being
smuggled by drug lords.

The seizure of millions of tablets has led to a shortage of  the  drug,  and
hence a fight between opposing gangs over control of  the  supply  chain  of
these drugs.

The seriousness with which our Government views drug trafficking  and  abuse
is reflected in the number  of  initiatives  it  has  implemented  to  date.
Government has created a  legislative  framework  within  which  police  can
fight these drug barons. Acts against organised crime  and  money-laundering
and the establishment of mechanisms, such  as  the  Asset  Forfeiture  Unit,
have been introduced to give police  greater  powers  in  seizing  the  ill-
gotten gains of drug trafficking.

Government has also developed a National Drug Master  Plan  to  provide  our
country with an institutional  framework  within  which  to  deal  with  the
effects of drug and alcohol abuse on society. In terms of the National  Drug
Master Plan, a number of key  areas  of  focus  have  been  identified,  and
various Government departments  are  working  together  around  these  focus
areas to reduce the availability of and demand for drugs.

In addition, we have concluded a number of international agreements  on  co-
operation in criminal matters with other countries,  such  as  Colombia,  to
strengthen the fight against drug trafficking. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr H T SOGONI: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, the prevalence  of
alcohol and drug abuse in our society has reached epidemic  proportions.  It
is a problem that has developed over many  decades  and,  as  such,  it  has
sadly and apparently become a cultural phenomenon, or it appears  as  if  it
is acceptable to society.

In the case of alcohol, the  situation  is  exacerbated  by  mass  marketing
which projects the use of alcohol as something  fashionable.  We  must  also
recognise that alcohol abuse in some cases is  passed  on  from  parents  to
children. Therefore, it eats into the social fabric, because  many  children
grow up in homes where it is the norm rather than the exception.

In a society in which alcohol and drug abuse are  common,  coupled  as  they
usually are with drug trafficking, organised  crime  and  gangsterism,  many
neighbourhoods turn into slums ruled by drug  lords.  Gangsterism  feeds  on
and increases the decay of every  aspect  of  the  functioning  of  affected
communities.

Dysfunctional education, poverty, and depravity or  sexual  abuse  become  a
vicious cycle that continually churns out  generation  after  generation  of
victims and drug dealers. It is a sad reality that poverty  and  drug  abuse
often go hand in hand. In a country with such high poverty levels  as  South
Africa, we must be extremely vigilant.

Therefore, it is of vital importance to the UDM that the  Government  should
have in place or step up  an  integrated  strategy,  supported  by  adequate
funding, to effectively deal with gangsterism and drug trafficking.

Organised  crime,  especially  as  a  result  of  links  with  international
criminal networks, has access  to  an  excessive  amount  of  resources.  We
cannot win this battle  if  Government  and  all  stakeholders  ignore  this
crucial area.

The opening up of the South African economy, coupled with individual  rights
after 1994, has unfortunately contributed to the massive inflow  of  illicit
drugs and internationally organised crime networks.  However,  it  does  not
mean  that  we  should,  in  knee-jerk   reaction,   become   advocates   of
prohibition. Prohibition has been a failure wherever it has been  attempted.
Neither should we argue, therefore, that the opposite extreme of  legalising
drug use and regulating it would bring the problem under  control.  Instead,
we  must  consider  a  multilevel  and  partnership  strategy  endorsed  and
implemented by government and civil society.

If anyone doubts the extent of the problem, available statistics supply  the
following information: It is estimated that 80% of all interpersonal  injury
patients at hospitals are drunk, while 60%  of  car  accidents  victims  are
also drunk. In other words, more than 30 000 people die a violent  death  as
a result of alcohol or drug abuse. It  is  reported  that  as  much  as  two
thirds of violent crimes  are  committed  by  drunk  or  inebriated  people,
usually  against  members  of  their  families  or  friends.[Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon Minister  Dr  Z  S  T  Skweyiya  and  hon
members, today's topic refers to compulsive  overusage  of  alcohol  or  any
other psychoactive substances which carries adverse  effects  for  the  user
and those around him, ranging from  physical  and  social  to  psychological
problems. This is a serious problem  facing  our  society,  and  the  rising
trend in this behaviour can be seen  to  be  directly  proportional  to  the
deterioration  of  our  societal  structure.  If  this  is   not   addressed
timeously, many lives will be destroyed, some as early  as  in  utero,  when
children are born with fetal  alcohol  syndrome,  or  later  on  during  the
course of their lives.

This problem affects all provinces, especially the  medical  profession  and
all other care-givers, including all departments dealing  with  this  social
health hazard. This carries serious implications since  it  comes  with  the
depletion of scanty resources. This has  serious  implications  in  that  it
means that the resources that could be used to address more  serious  health
issues facing this country are  diverted  and  used  in  treating  addiction
problems. At present people are dying like flies because of HIV/Aids  in  my
province, KwaZulu-Natal, and in other provinces as well.

This affects us greatly in all health dimensions  that  one  may  think  of.
These substances are not only bad for one's  health,  but  they  also  cause
many  domestic  problems  such  as  violence,  women  and  child  abuse  and
disrupted family unity. When a person is  under  the  influence  of  liquor,
intoxicating  drugs  or  substances,  he  fails  to  maintain  his  personal
integrity. At that point he is a danger not only to  himself,  but  also  to
those around him. Some people lose self-control  and  start  displaying  low
morals. They become alcoholics or drug addicts who need  institutional  care
and rehabilitation.

To effectively address this problem we  have  to  get  to  its  root  cause.
People get into alcohol or substance abuse because of various reasons.  Some
have  emotional  stress,  frustration,  anger  or  extreme  worries   which,
eventually, lead them to the  bottle.  Children  from  broken  families  and
those who have disturbed relationships with parents are most susceptible  to
such abuse. The socioeconomic status of  a  person  is  also  a  determining
factor since some of these drugs are expensive. That is why some people  who
cannot afford the high prices even steal family valuables to  get  money  to
buy and satisfy their cravings.

It  is  clear  that,  to  effectively  address  this   social   problem,   a
multidisciplinary approach needs to be applied  across  a  broader  spectrum
throughout the country.

Yinkinga lena  esiphezu  kwayo.  Isichithe  imizi  eminingi,  kwafa  nabantu
abaningi.   Ngikhuluma   ngophuzo   oludakisayo   nezidakamizwa,    okungaba
ngamaphilisi adliwayo, okhokheyni, ihiroyni nokunye.  Insangu  nayo  ikhona,

Isizwe sethu  siyashabalala  yilezi  zidakamizwa.  Utshwala  budala  kakhulu

Utshwala bungukudla okwenamisayo, ngakho umcimbi ongenabo  utshwala  akuwona
umcimbi lowo. Abantu baye bahambe bethuka,  bedemelayisa  besho  yonke  into
le. Buyafuneka utshwala ... (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[That is the problem we are facing at the  moment.  It  has  destroyed  many
families and killed many people. I  am  talking  about  alcohol  and  drugs,
including pills, cocaine, heroin and other things. Dagga is  also  included,
although it has a healing substance. The problem is that  dagga  is  a  drug
that kills a person's brain. It makes a person do things that he  would  not
have done if he had not smoked it.

Our nation is dying because of these drugs. Beer is older  than  all  of  us
here and it is a kind of food that makes  people  happy.  We  should  accept
that. Beer is a nice food; a party without beer is not a party. If there  is
no alcohol people hurl abuse and say bad things. Beer is needed ...]

... but to a certain extent. It must remain within the parameters  of  being
a food substance, not poison.

Isizwe sethu sishabalala  ngokuthi  abantu  abaphuzeli  ukudla  noma  ukoma,
kepha baphuzela ukudakwa. Abantu baphuzela ukudakwa, yilobo-ke ubuthi.

(Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Our nation is dying because people do not drink for the sake  of  quenching
thirst, they drink so that they can get drunk and that is the real poison.

In the end a drinker becomes addicted. He would spend the  money  he  should
have used to buy healthy things. It makes no sense that a  father  fails  to
look after his family and even forgets that he is married  just  because  he
is now marrying alcohol, which in the end makes him a nonentity.

Inhaling drugs, taking pills and  injections  are  used  especially  by  the
youth. They destroy the blood and destroy the  brain.  They  are  disastrous
things to take. Now there is an even more  dangerous  drug  called  ecstasy.
Once you have taken it you become overexcited.  The  blood  runs  too  fast,
which eventually causes the heart to stop beating.

The whole community needs to stand up and join  forces  against  this  habit
that  is  destroying  our  youth.  Such  killings,  such  crime,  such  rape
incidents, delinquents, disrespect, contempt and other things that weaken  a
person's status, all result from the use of these drugs.

This thing bothers us in KwaZulu-Natal to a very great  extent.  We  need  a
strong organisation and strategies to combat this habit. The worst  part  of
it is that it has now affected women, the elderly, and the young,  including
brides. Some get the money to buy these  things  from  selling  their  human
treasure. I do not want to name it, hon  members  know  what  I  am  talking
about. [Interjections.]

A person sells her body just because she wants to  buy  a  bottle  of  beer.
Children at home then have to look after themselves like the children  of  a
snake.

I would like to say that the hon the Minister is facing  a  big  problem  in
her department. We are facing only two enemies, namely  alcohol  and  drugs.
Crime would have been reduced if these things were not escalating.

We in KwaZulu-Natal, in the name  of  the  IFP  and  other  parties  in  the
province, agree with all of you. We would like to say  thank  you  again  to
the committee on health. [Laughter.]]

We give credit to this lady, Loretta, and  the  social  services  committee,
for initiating this topic. It is very rich. It is a social problem,  and  we
need to join efforts and fight this enemy, but in a proper way.

Amalungu ahloniphekile makakhumbule ukuthi utshwala  budala  kunathi  sonke,
bungukudla kodwa ... [Hon members should  remember  that  alcohol  is  older
than us, it is food, however ...]

... too much of anything is dangerous.

Ms F B MARSHOFF (Free State): Chairperson, hon  Minister,  hon  members  and
colleagues, this debate comes at  a  crucial  time  for  our  province.  The
Department of Social Development has just gone  through  a  reprioritisation
process. We are now focusing on programmes geared towards children  and  the
youth, especially those at risk. We do this because we  realise  that  there
is an urgent need to address the  challenges  faced  by  our  youth  in  our
province and to enable them to make informed choices with  regard  to  their
physical, psychological and mental wellbeing. In short,  we  want  to  equip
them with the necessary tools to take control of their own lives.

Allow me to give an overview of the  Free  State  province.  For  those  hon
members who do not know or profess not to know, the Free  State  is  a  very
rural province. We might be the food basket of the country, but we are  also
very poor. Poverty levels are very high and those mostly affected are  women
and  children.  Because  of  the  social  conditions  in  which  they   find
themselves, they are vulnerable to coercion, exploitation and abuse.  It  is
even more so with the  youth  because  most  of  them  are  not  skilled  to
withstand these outside pressures.

Alcohol abuse in our province is one of the major concerns that we  have  to
grapple with. Statistics show that the Free State has the highest  incidence
of alcohol abuse amongst the males in the country. As many as 56,2%  of  men
abuse alcohol, compared to approximately 30% of women. [Interjections.]

It is also interesting ...  The  hon  member  has  just  been  to  the  bar.
[Laughter.] It is also interesting to  note  that  over  weekends,  men  and
women become equal drinking partners. Research has  also  shown  that  those
that succumb to these weekend drinking sprees are the youth. This  shows  us
that we have  to  come  up  with  specific  intervention  strategies  geared
towards these young men  and  women  in  order  for  them  to  change  their
lifestyle. The only way we can achieve this is  through  proper  life-skills
programmes, in an intersectoral effort involving not  just  Government,  but
also civil society, business, religion and other interested parties.

Our Government spends about R1 billion annually on the treatment  of  babies
and children affected by fetal alcohol syndrome.

Now we all know that the dop system is illegal,  but  we  also  continue  to
find this practice on farms, especially in the Western Cape.  This  is  done
either directly or indirectly  through  payment  for  services  rendered  or
through purchasing of cheap wine and spirits on  credit  from  the  farmers.
This is a legacy of the past that we are trying to move away  from.  We  are
also imploring these wine farmers to desist  from  these  practices  and  to
assist us in improving the socioeconomic conditions of our people by  paying
them in cash and not in kind.

The economic impact of fetal alcohol syndrome on  the  country  in  general,
and  the  Free  State  in  particular,  is  tremendous.  We  cannot   budget
adequately for the treatment of these babies because we never know how  many
FAS babies will be born in a specific year.

It has a tremendous impact on the health system.  These  children  are  born
with  a  low  birth  weight,  they  are  frail  and  will  inevitably   have
difficulties coping  at  school  owing  to  psychological  and  intellectual
impairments.

The vicious cycle repeats itself because they will in  turn  become  alcohol
and drug abusers. This paints a very bleak picture of our province,  but  it
does not mean we are  hopeless  in  the  face  of  adversity.  We  have  put
strategies in place and we are confident that we will begin to see  pay-offs
in the very near future.

We are not only allocating financial and other resources aimed  at  specific
prevention strategies, but also looking at treatment and  rehabilitation  to
turn the tide. We know that the family unit is the  basic  social  structure
in society and our intervention strategies are aimed  at  providing  support
that will enable families to deal with and respond to the demands made  upon
them.

To prevent further family disintegration,  we  have  introduced  educational
programmes that will strengthen  family  life  and  empower  the  youth  and
children in our province. Our young children are exposed to  so  many  evils
and the Free State is only beginning to feel the impact of the drug scene.

As I stated earlier on, alcohol abuse is a major concern, but  other  drugs,
such as Mandrax,  crack  cocaine,  ecstasy  and  speed,  are  becoming  more
popular amongst our youth. These club drugs, as they are known,  are  making
greater inroads among the working-class  children  because  drug  lords  and
peddlers are making them more affordable for them.

In trying to address this problem, we  are  funding  programmes  at  schools
such as  the  Addicted  to  Life  clubs.  Jointly  with  the  department  of
education, health and safety and community liaison, we are  providing  life-
skills educational programmes which enable them to make better choices  such
as saying no to drugs. We must emphasise that we need the  the  co-operation
of the justice system to assist us in the  battle  because  the  police  are
becoming frustrated for various reasons. One of these  reasons  is  that  as
soon as they have these offenders behind bars, they are  able  to  pay  bail
and be out on the streets doing exactly what they did previously.

We know that one way of reaching the youth  and  children  is  through  mass
media campaigns. These educate the public and communities to identify  high-
risk areas and inform on these pushers and drug lords. We are also  thinking
of requesting the department of economic affairs in the province to look  at
stringent regulations to regulate liquor outlets and taverns.

We have also set aside some funding for  programmes  targeting  students  in
secondary and tertiary institutions in the coming  financial  year.  We  are
establishing a winter school for secondary students that will focus  on  the
following: substance abuse and the effects that it has on communities,  peer
counselling and support, and the relationship between  substance  abuse  and
the related spread of HIV and Aids as well as STDs. Part of our strategy  is
to focus on the role students can play in health  promotion  and  prevention
programmes with regard to substance abuse. More  specifically,  we  want  to
impart skills and awareness to enable them to safeguard the moral  fibre  of
society.

It would be remiss of me not to focus briefly on the link between  substance
abuse and the HIV pandemic. If we look at the vulnerability of  young  girls
and women, and the economic power that is wielded by men,  we  then  realise
that for women to survive they have to resort  to  desperate  measures.  The
result is that women are sometimes forced to sell or  use  their  bodies  to
survive. This behaviour results in them being even more susceptible  to  HIV
infection.

Substance abuse also makes people less inhibited and this in turn  leads  to
risky sexual behaviour and unprotected sex, which in the case of  the  youth
leads to teenage pregnancies and possibly even HIV infection. So  this  goes
to back to ensuring that we have targeted programmes aimed at the youth  and
especially young  women  that  will  keep  them  occupied,  especially  over
weekends. In this respect we are looking at sporting activities as  well  as
weekend camps in collaboration with our partners to make this a success  for
our province.

The Free State province is taking the  threat  of  all  types  of  substance
abuse  very  seriously.  We  are  working  hard  on  policies  that  can  be
effectively implemented. The department has  also  made  inputs  on  a  drug
document, on the minimum  norms  and  standards  on  substance  abuse  at  a
national level, which is awaiting approval.

Furthermore, the Alcohol  and  Drug  Abuse  Prevention,  Rehabilitation  and
Research Centre in Bloemfontein is  currently  training  social  workers  to
enable them to develop proper intervention  strategies  that  would  address
the problems as experienced by the youth in the province.

We also have  a  forum  on  alcohol  and  drug  abuse  which  comprises  the
provincial departments of  social  development,  health  and  education  and
other role-players like the  Aurora  Alcohol  and  Drug  Centre,  Sanca  and
tertiary institutions like the Free State Technikon and  the  University  of
the Free State. Its function is to plan and co-ordinate programmes with  all
role-players in the field of alcohol and drug abuse.

The department is also part  of  the  SA  Alliance  for  the  Prevention  of
Substance  Abuse.  In  order  for  us  to  make   targeted   and   effective
interventions, we are also funding NGOs to  deliver  social  work  services,
like the Aurora Alcohol and Drug Centre in  Bloemfontein,  which  is  funded
for inpatient as well as outpatient treatment, as  well  as  for  prevention
and support services. But we are gradually moving away  from  detoxification
programmes in favour of prevention strategies.

We also fund Sanca, both in Welkom  and  in  Sasolburg,  which  is  for  our
support services. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  colleagues  and  friends,  what
happens to an educated person who becomes addicted to alcohol?  This  person
loses his or her senses and becomes highly  irresponsible.  Therefore  I  do
not know whether we should equate alcohol with food, as  Mrs  Vilakazi  did,
because if it changes somebody to become a different  person  it  is  not  a
very good food. [Laughter.]

We can continue to argue that we have an enormous  backlog  of  re-education
that needs to take place over both the long and the short term so  that  our
people can begin to regain their sense of dignity and self-worth.  We  could
even give up and say that the problem is too huge for us to handle.

All of us remember the 1976 Soweto  uprising,  when  some  beer  halls  were
burnt to the ground to protest against the use of revenue raised  from  beer
sales to finance township oppression. My colleagues,  some  of  them  seated
here, saw those beer halls, and  the  resultant  alcoholism,  as  a  serious
obstruction to the black struggle against white domination, a  disempowering
of our political independence.

The ANC in its national health plan had  already  stated  that  alcohol  and
substance abuse needed to be targeted effectively if we wanted to  help  our
people  get  out  of  the  cycle  of  poverty  that  inhibited  growth   and
development.  Even  in  our  RDP  programme  close  attention  was  paid  to
substance abuse.

It has been said  here  that  millions  of  South  Africans  abuse  alcohol,
tobacco, dagga, solvents like petrol and glue and other hard  drugs.  Unless
action is taken, substance abuse is likely to increase enormously. Abuse  of
these substances causes immense physical,  mental  and  social  damage,  and
costs the country millions of rands each year.

The RDP must aim to greatly reduce the level  of  substance  abuse,  and  to
prevent any increase. As leaders in Government we have  not  rested  on  our
laurels in our attempts to rid our people  of  this  scourge.  We  are  very
serious in our endeavours to rid our country  of  the  damaging  effects  of
drug and alcohol abuse. We have monitored very closely the increase in  both
local and international crime syndicates that view our new  democracy  as  a
new market for illegal drug trafficking. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, there is a lot  of
noise now. Can you please give the hon member a chance? Please continue.

Rev P MOATSHE: Because of this  increase  we  have  already  identified  the
necessity of a drug master plan,  primarily  not  only  to  co-ordinate  and
integrate South Africa's disjointed and  fragmented  response  to  the  drug
problem, but also to ensure  that  we  were  on  a  par  with  international
practice. South Africa has become rather an  important  cog  in  the  global
wheel of  drug  trafficking  and  our  response  needs  to  take  this  into
cognisance.

Developments from 1998 to 2000 at 25 schools in the Cape  metropolitan  area
show that young people who reported higher levels of  substance  abuse  also
reported higher levels of marital  conflict  between  their  parents.  These
findings clearly indicate that we have to look  very  closely  at  the  very
basic family unit and to direct our prevention and  treatment  campaigns  at
each and every home, church, mosque, synagogue and community.

A global initiative on the  primary  prevention  of  substance  abuse  among
young people, the prevention of fetal  alcohol  syndrome,  the  training  of
primary health care workers in  the  prevention  and  treatment  of  alcohol
disorders, the remodelling  of  treatment  and  rehabilitation  models,  the
prevention  of  substance  abuse  in  the  workplace  and  substance   abuse
awareness campaigns are all practical efforts this Government  is  currently
engaged in to combat drug and alcohol abuse. What we need to ensure is  that
this programme and others are rolled out to  all  our  communities.  We  are
willing in the NCOP and as active members in our society to  do  our  utmost
to ensure that we have a healthy society. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Mr Chairperson, it has been  a  pleasure
to be here, listening. I think we have done justice to the topic that is  in
front of us.

It is quite obvious that alcohol and drug abuse is a problem that is  facing
this country. I think that it is basically the duty of the NCOP and that  of
Government, as a whole, to do everything in its  power  to  ensure  that  we
educate our community as we educate  our  children  and  our  youth  on  its
effects on our society, specifically on its effects on our  families.  I  am
really pleased that this was raised.

However,  the  main  question  which  I  think  we  should  also  take  into
consideration is what Mrs Vilakazi  was  saying  here  with  regard  to  the
effect of this abuse of alcohol and drugs, the impact it has had,  not  only
on our communities and families but, more  importantly,  in  the  spread  of
HIV/Aids. I think that is one of the things that I thought would  have  been
stressed more in this debate so that we should, in future, try to guide  our
youth towards a greater understanding  of  the  impact  of  drug  abuse  and
alcoholism on our communities as such.

Obviously it is quite clear, as she said, that we are  burying  many  people
on a daily basis, almost each and every weekend. Most  of  them  are  young,
between the ages of 20 - 15, actually - and 40. Those  are  the  flowers  of
our people, of  our  nation,  and  we  should,  as  such,  individually  and
collectively through our political parties try to impress upon  our  society
and our people that it is not only not cool to be boozed and to  be  stoned,
but also leads to loss of life in many ways. [Applause.]

       THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE ON THE FABRIC OF SOCIETY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Mr Chairperson, I wish  to,  at  the  outset,
thank the hon the Minister for  introducing  this  subject  in  this  House.
Without going into details, but allowing the provinces to speak, he  merely,
in his introduction, earmarked various aspects that he felt  were  necessary
and, true to his words, these  were  the  issues  that  were  raised,  quite
copiously, by the members.

It is customary for us, in this House, when we  have  a  matter  for  public
discussion, to adopt  a  resolution  representing  the  voices  of  all  the
provinces and political parties that are present here. In the spirit of  the
discussions that have taken place here, I would like to move without  notice
that we adopt the following motion:
  That the Council -


  (1) recognises that the misuse of alcohol and drugs by South Africans has
       both short-term and long-term consequences, including a  decrease  in
       learning ability which impacts negatively on education;


  (2) further recognises that the continued misuse of alcohol and drugs  by
       disadvantaged sectors protracts underdevelopment in these sectors and
       prevents access to social and economic opportunities  which  are  now
       available in our democratic country;


  (3) recognises the correlation between alcohol and drug abuse  and  crime
       and road accidents;


  (4) acknowledges the efforts of NGOs, CBOs and faith-based  organisations
       in helping to combat drug and alcohol abuse;


  (5) believes that national, provincial and local governments need  closer
       co-operation   and   co-ordination   among   all   institutions   and
       organisations to help eradicate the detrimental effects that  alcohol
       and substance abuse have on the fabric of our society;


  (6) recognises the role of organised criminal syndicates globally in  the
       proliferation of drugs and drug-trafficking;


  (7) calls on -


       (a)  the national  Department  of  Social  Development  to  help  co-
           ordinate a multi-pronged, multi-sectoral, integrated approach in
           all three spheres of government to  ensure  that  resources  are
           shared and programmes  of  action  are  aligned  to  combat  the
           effects of drug and substance abuse in South Africa;


       (b)  the Department of Education, together with  the  Departments  of
           Social  Development  and  Health,  to  increase  the  range   of
           treatment and prevention programmes  focusing  on  children  and
           youth,  thus  improving  the  access  to  quality,  school-based
           programmes for education;


       (c)   the  Departments  of  Education,  of  Health  and   of   Social
           Development to equip teachers at primary, secondary and tertiary
           institutions with training programmes in order to help  identify
           the occurrence of alcohol and substance abuse amongst  learners;
           and


       (d)  the Departments of  Safety  and  Security  and  of  Justice  and
           Constitutional  Development  to  continue  and  intensify  their
           efforts  in  dealing  with  organised   crime,   including   the
           appropriate implementation  of  legislation  passed  to  counter
           organised crime;


  (8) undertakes to regularly monitor and oversee the progress  in  all  of
         the programmes geared towards the elimination of drug  and  alcohol
         abuse;


  (9) urges the media to assist government in its campaign against  alcohol
         and substance abuse; and


  (10)     calls on parents to imbue our children, who, after all, are  the
         leaders of tomorrow, with sound moral values.

Ms F B MARSHOFF (Free State): I wish to move the following amendment:


  That paragraph (3) be substituted by the following paragraph:


  (3) recognises the correlation between alcohol and drug abuse and  crime,
       road accidents and HIV/Aids;

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL:  Mr  Chairperson,  we  support  the  proposed
amendment. In fact, it has been correctly noted by the hon the Minister.
Amendment agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Motion, as  amended,  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the

           effects of drug and substance abuse in South Africa;


       (b)  the Department of Education, together with  the  Departments  of
           Social  Development  and  Health,  to  increase  the  range   of
           treatment and prevention programmes  focusing  on  children  and
