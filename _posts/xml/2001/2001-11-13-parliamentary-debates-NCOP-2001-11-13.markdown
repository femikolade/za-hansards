ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mr President, welcome to  the  NCOP.  It
is indeed a great pleasure, once more, to have you with us.  You  may  note,
Mr President, that in the public gallery, for once, and quite unusually,  we
have citizens of South Africa present in the National Council. A  number  of
the citizens that are in the public gallery  are  persons  who  have  served
their  country  and  communities  as  volunteers  and  have  won  awards  as
volunteer organisations and individuals contributing to  the  upliftment  of
their communities.

As  you  would  know,  this  year,  2001,  is  the  International  Year   of
Volunteers, and we therefore thought it quite important that we  should  ask
the various volunteers, from across  organisations  and  communities  within
the Western Cape, to participate in this important day when we have  you  in
the House. [Applause.]

                   ELECTION OF ROTATING DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON

The meeting proceeded to the election of the rotating Deputy Chairperson  of
the National Council of Provinces to fill the post vacated  by  the  Premier
of the Northern Province, Adv N A Ramatlhodi.

The Chairperson of the NCOP called for nominations.

Mr M E Surty, seconded by  Mr  M  Shilowa,  nominated  Mr  P  S  Molefe  for
election as rotating Deputy Chairperson of the  NCOP  in  terms  of  section
64(3) of the Constitution.

The Returning Officer reported to the  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP  that  the
nomination paper had been properly completed.

There being no further nominations, the Chairperson of the NCOP declared  Mr
P S Molefe duly elected rotating Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP in terms  of
section 64(3) of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! On behalf of delegates here  present,  I
congratulate you on having been elected as the rotating  Deputy  Chairperson
of the NCOP in terms of section 64(3) of the Constitution.

The PREMIER OF THE NORTH WEST (Mr P S Molefe):  Chairperson,  Mr  President,
premiers, hon members of the NCOP, it gives me great pleasure to  have  been
nominated so unanimously  by  the  members  of  this  Council.  I  think  my
position has both symbolic and functional value. Its symbolic value lies  in
the fact that as premiers we can use this position to ensure that  there  is
co-ordination and interaction between this Council and the executive in  the
provinces. That is where the symbolic value of this House lies.

There is another important aspect, and that is that we  should  be  able  to
ensure that there is also an interaction between the standing committees  of
this House, and the MECs in various provinces, to ensure that  there  is  an
exchange of information and that information on what  is  happening  in  the
provinces is also flowing from the provinces to the NCOP. It  also  provides
an opportunity for members of this House to  participate  in  committees  in
the provinces.

The utilisation of this Chamber as an important national  forum  to  members
is, indeed, of particular interest to the provinces. We  can  also  use  the
Council to promote greater participation in intergovernmental fiscal  review
matters, to ensure that we deepen our understanding on  how  we  have  dealt
with issues of finances and on the concrete reality regarding  the  problems
that Government  in  various  spheres  has  to  confront  with  the  limited
resources available to it.

We can also use this legislative body as a conduit for legislation  that  is
transformatory in nature,  which  also  ensures  that  in  that  legislative
process we are able to provide  an  opportunity  for  interaction  with  the
executive at the national level and also  at  the  provincial  level.  These
areas require further  discussion  and  debate,  and  they  can  be  further
developed so that this office assumes responsibility of this function  in  a
manner that enhances the value of the NCOP.

I do trust that my election will add value to the work that this  House  and
the  previous  Deputy  Chairperson  have  been  doing,  together  with   the
Chairperson and the permanent Deputy Chairperson of this House.

I would like to take this opportunity to  thank  all  the  members  for  the
confidence that they have shown in me. [Applause.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! We now proceed  to  invite  the  various
premier colleagues of the new rotating Deputy  Chairperson  to  offer  brief
congratulations.  We  begin  with   the   hon   outgoing   rotating   Deputy
Chairperson, Premier Ramatlhodi.

The PREMIER OF THE NORTHERN PROVINCE (Adv N A Ramatlhodi): Madam Chair,  hon
President and colleagues, it is an honour and a  privilege  to  be  afforded
this opportunity of congratulating Premier Molefe on his  elevation  to  the
position of  second  Deputy  Chairperson  of  this  august  Chamber.  As  an
outgoing second Deputy Chairperson, I can assure  Comrade  Molefe  that  the
position  he  is  assuming  today  is,  indeed,  very  daunting,  given  the
importance of the NCOP in the body politic of South Africa. He should  think
of himself as treading where angels fear to tread.

However, he is in good  company  with  the  Chairperson  and  the  permanent
Deputy Chairperson, and I am sure he will bring to this work the  wealth  of
experience that he has  garnered  over  the  years.  I  also  want  to  take
advantage of this opportunity to say that  we  are  most  grateful  for  his
having recovered from his recent operation, and I know it has been a bit  of
a difficult time. We are not loading him with more functions because  we  do
appreciate the fact that he might still be a bit fragile.  Nevertheless,  we
are confident that he is a soldier that has been produced by the people  and
that he will carry this burden with fortitude. Congratulations! [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! With the leave of  the  House,  we  will
allow the premiers from the other provinces to include their  congratulatory
notes to the rotating Deputy Chairperson in  their  speeches  following  the
address by the President.

We therefore conclude the election proceedings.

                    ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC

The PRESIDENT  OF  THE  REPUBLIC:  Madam  Chairperson,  Deputy  Chairperson,
rotating Deputy Chairperson -  I  hope  he  has  stopped  rotating  now  ...
[Laughter.]  ...  hon  premiers,  hon  members,  councillors  and  community
leaders who are present  with  us  here  today  -  I  think  I  should  also
acknowledge the hon Cecil Herandien, who is handling  a  somewhat  difficult
situation from what I see in the media ... [Laughter.] ... I would  like  to
thank you for the opportunity  you  have  given  us  once  more  to  discuss
important matters with the NCOP. Last year when we addressed this  House  we
spoke about the challenges facing all of us with regard to local  government
structures and their role and place in the transformation of our society.

Since then,  we  have  held  successful  local  government  elections,  thus
completing  the  important  work  of  bringing  about   genuine   democratic
structures in all spheres of government. The challenge we  now  face  is  to
ensure that these structures, working together with all our people from  all
stations of life, function as real agents of challenge  that  will  help  us
both to entrench democracy in  our  country  and  to  end  the  great  South
African divide  between  rich  and  poor,  between  the  developed  and  the
underdeveloped.

The challenge facing the new democratic  structures  of  Government  is  the
transformation of the lives of the many in our society  whose  existence  is
defined by the prospect of a bleak future. Through  concrete  programmes  we
must inculcate the hope and conviction among our people that, together  with
their  Government,  they  can  and  must   defeat   poverty,   disease   and
marginalisation.

Hence, we have, in the last seven years, constructed a  Government  that  is
not  only  democratic,  nonracial   and   nonsexist,   but   one   that   is
developmental. We have brought  into  being  a  Government  that,  while  it
confronts the challenges of reconstruction and  development,  simultaneously
involves the people in action, consistent with our vision  of  people-driven
processes of change.

In this context, the strengthening of local government structures  following
last year's first fully nonracial elections, at this level,  is  a  critical
element in building our democratic system of governance  and  ensuring  that
our people have the possibility of engaging practically in the processes  of
governance and development. By these comments,  we  seek  to  emphasise  the
view, I am certain we all share,  that  local  government  is  an  important
component  part  for  the  successful  implementation  of  our   development
programmes in both rural and urban areas.

Already,  all  the  new  local  authorities  have  submitted  their  Interim
Integrated Development Plans, which articulate  the  development  needs  and
priorities of  the  different  communities.  All  of  us,  and  particularly
members of this House, must ensure that the  Integrated  Development  Plans,
to be finalised in March next year, are practical, workable programmes  that
will be the tools for integrated  development  and  that  will  help  us  to
change effectively the living conditions of all our  people,  wherever  they
may be.

In this regard, at the national level a special  interministerial  committee
has been formed to assist the municipalities. In addition,  before  the  end
of this year, all three spheres of government will take part  in  a  special
meeting  of  the  President's  Co-ordinating  Council  in  order  to  assess
progress in the establishment of the new system of local government  and  to
determine areas  requiring  further  strengthening  of  the  system  of  co-
operative governance.

As the House is aware,  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of
Government, we have restructured the operation of our different  departments
to ensure integrated planning and implementation. This  means  that  we  are
moving away from a fragmented  system  of  governance  so  that  we  proceed
faster towards the realisation of the goal of a better life for all.

This   approach,   of   integrated   formulation   and   implementation   of
developmental  programmes  across   departments   and   among   spheres   of
government, informs our work as  we  implement  the  Integrated  Sustainable
Rural Development Programme and the Urban Renewal Strategy.

When we met in the national Cabinet lekgotla in July this  year,  Government
had concluded the detailed plans for rural development in the 13  identified
nodal points. The further 17 nodal points will be announced soon so that  we
move with the necessary speed to implement development  programmes  for  our
people in the rural areas.

As we have said in the past, we cannot just build a clinic when we have  not
trained the health personnel, when we have not budgeted for  drugs,  or  the
area does not  have  water,  sanitation  or  access  roads.  If  we  have  a
programme of assisting black farmers, we should ensure not  only  that  they
have access to machinery and finance, but that the infrastructure  in  their
areas is in a good condition, and that the telephones and  roads  are  in  a
working condition so that they  have  the  possibility  of  marketing  their
products.

It is also in this context that we have put in motion the implementation  of
one-stop centres, the multipurpose community  centres  that  bring  together
multiple government services in a single place,  ensuring  easy  access  for
people and communities that would otherwise be cut  off  from  the  services
they rightly deserve as citizens.

Implementation of the Urban Renewal Programme began in earnest in  May  this
year  with  the  Alexandra  project  in  the   Gauteng   province.   Further
elaboration of the Urban Renewal Strategy into a programme on par  with  the
rural development programme is at present in progress.

Following an assessment in September of all the  eight  urban  nodes,  nodal
business plans and reprioritising of funds  were  completed  in  October  in
preparation for a national workshop in  March  that  will  see  a  finalised
strategy and programme going to Cabinet in May next year.

The urgent matter of capacity has been addressed through the appointment  of
nodal  delivery  teams  whose  members  have  core  capacities  in   project
management, financial management and community facilitation. Clearly,  Madam
Chair, I should say that the people who are sitting up there today  must  be
part of this particular process. In this way, the quality of  work  will  be
enhanced, ensuring financial  accountability  and  expediting  the  pace  of
delivery. I mention these in part to illustrate what can and should be  done
by all of us to ensure the provision  of  goods  and  services  to  all  our
people on a sustainable basis. In this context we must  also  emphasise  the
point that all of us  should,  at  the  same  time,  refuse  to  accept  the
provision of shoddy goods and services to our people, as  this,  apart  from
anything else, constitutes a waste of scarce public resources.

As we have said earlier, we also seek to involve the people in the  work  of
the reconstruction and development of our  country.  We  therefore  seek  to
make ours a truly participatory  democracy.  To  this  end,  Government  has
embarked on the Imbizo programme of engaging our people,  to  have  dialogue
with them,  to  hear  their  views,  to  listen  to  their  concerns,  their
grievances and advice about the pace, direction and content of our work.

As we speak here today, we have just participated in the first Imbizo  focus
week as  part  of  this  campaign.  The  theme  of  ``Intergovernmental  Co-
operation for  Local  Delivery''  saw  sustained  activity  in  all  of  our
provinces around implementation at the  local  level.  The  events  involved
members of the executive from  all  three  spheres  of  government.  At  the
national level many Ministers and Deputy Ministers  were  involved,  as  was
the presidency, with the Deputy President involved during the  week  itself.
I myself paid a visit to the Eastern Cape shortly before this week began.

This  interaction  is  important  because  the  people  who  voted  us  into
Government have done so because they want us to change or to help to  change
their lives. It is important that we do not seek  their  views  only  during
election periods, but that we should do this consistently and at all times.

Through the imbizos and the interactive, participatory engagements with  the
people, democracy is enhanced and the content of  this  democracy  is  fully
expressed on an ongoing basis. As we carry out this work,  it  is  important
that the different spheres of government, as well  as  various  departments,
communicate  a  coherent  message  to  the  people  and  not  respond  in  a
fragmented and contradictory manner. We have to do  this,  because  we  must
interact with the people in an honest manner, confronting, practically,  the
challenges that face the people.

Through this interactive programme the people should know  exactly  what  we
are doing, how we are doing it, why there are delays in  specific  instances
and what Government is doing about obstacles to the  implementation  of  our
development programmes. Through the imbizos we should make it  possible  for
all of us to celebrate the successes we have registered  and  together  plan
for  the  initiation  or  acceleration  of   outstanding   programmes.   The
interactive programmes should also assist us in clearly defining  the  roles
and responsibilities of Government,  the  state-owned  enterprises,  private
businesses, the NGOs, the  trade  unions,  the  community  leaders  who  are
sitting  in  this  room  today,  and  the  masses  of  our  people  in   the
transformation process in each and every locality.

This interactive programme should also help to improve the effectiveness  of
our  public  representatives,  by  making  them  alive  to   the   practical
difficulties facing the public servants who  are  at  the  coalface  of  the
implementation of our programmes, as well as service delivery.

In my own interaction with people working at  the  delivery  level,  I  have
often been confronted by problems that should be solved in the course  of  a
day's work. Yet, these problems drag on for months  or  even  years  without
anyone attending to them. Surely it cannot be that  problems  will  only  be
solved because the President has visited an area? It is  the  responsibility
of all of us, the councillor, the mayor, the  traditional  leader,  the  MP,
the MPL, the MEC, the premier, the  Minister  and  the  Deputy  Minister  to
attend to each and every problem that faces our people. In this way we  will
bring Government closer to the people  and  contribute  practically  to  the
acceleration of the process towards improving the lives  of  especially  the
poor in our country.

The imbizos we have attended have highlighted  problems  in  implementation,
but also presented practical solutions that could be  achieved  if  we  work
together. What we saw during two of these, what we  heard  and  learnt,  was
both inspiring and challenging. While the majority  of  South  Africans  all
over the country have experienced poverty, our programme took  us  to  areas
where  it  is  worse  than  most.  We  learnt  that  some  of  the  problems
experienced by  people  in  these  communities  were  as  a  result  of  the
inability of the managers appointed by Government to carry  out  their  work
and that the blockages experienced were a result of this.

There was, for example, a case of bad management at a hospital. It was  only
through our visit that an intergovernmental procedure was  unblocked  which,
up until then, had prevented a hot water geyser in the hospital  from  being
repaired. This had resulted in the hospital having no hot water.  We  learnt
that where communities had some years ago advised the Government on  how  to
deal with projects, Government had refused to listen. This had  resulted  in
the collapse of these projects after all the necessary investment  had  been
made. We were told of councillors who had  not  been  in  touch  with  their
people and were only seen towards election time. Fortunately, the  situation
seems to me to have improved significantly since our last  local  government
elections.

Above all, it is clear that our people are eager  for  change  and  want  to
work as partners with Government in  expediting  that  change  and  ensuring
that that change benefits them. The people are conscious of their  roles  in
developing themselves and the entire country and believe that we as  elected
representatives should act as true partners with them in everything  we  do.
They are also driven by a sense of confidence that, together, we will win.

In some parts it seemed that the people were not attending meetings as  they
should to speak to their councillors about their problems and  perspectives.
It is clear therefore that through the imbizos we have created a  space  for
more meetings to take place, more possibilities where Government and  people
could converse and reach conclusions on the way ahead. Above  all,  we  have
learnt that Government ought to listen more to what the people  are  saying,
that the people have an important input to make about what must be done.

The lessons learnt from the imbizos pose challenges to  all  of  us  at  all
levels of government. These include our management capacity, which needs  to
be strengthened in order for projects and programmes to  happen  effectively
and within the  timeframes  agreed;  and  for  relations  between  different
levels of government to be strengthened through a fully integrated  approach
that would expedite delivery. The Government needs to listen, and  needs  to
learn to listen, to take note and to act quickly on concerns raised  by  the
people. Clearly,  more  opportunities  should  be  created  for  imbizo-type
meetings to occur so that government by the people and  for  the  people  is
clearly seen to be an ongoing relationship of  accountability,  a  conscious
partnership true to the electoral mandate that has been given.

I am urging all of us, in the course of our work, to travel beyond  the  end
of a tarred road. We should be prepared to forego the luxury and  smoothness
of a tarred road and deal with the bumpy potholes and  rough  surface  of  a
gravel road. That is where we will see the real South Africa that is  posing
the challenges that we must overcome.

Although burdened by poverty and underdevelopment, the  South  Africans  who
live  beyond  the  tarred  roads  have  refused  to  be  defeated  by  their
conditions. They have refused to be victims  of  circumstance.  We  will  be
inspired to experience at first hand the determination of  these  people  to
work with Government to change their lives.

Because of this partnership, we have seen communities  enjoying  the  fruits
of democracy and  of  the  implementation  of  Government  policies  -  farm
labourers becoming owners of the farms they had worked on  for  many  years;
villagers blessing the gift of life as clean piped water came  to  them  for
the first time. We have seen how this partnership has made it  possible  for
nurses in rural areas to use  telemedicine  to  access  specialised  medical
services, both to diagnose and to treat maladies affecting  their  patients.
We have come across young people in the rural areas using  the  Internet  to
learn mathematics and the sciences, because  Eskom  brought  electricity  to
their village and the CSIR and the Department of Arts, Culture, Science  and
Technology brought in computers.

We have seen the practical partnership between Afrikaner  farmers  assisting
black  farmers  to  overcome  historical  barriers  and  become   successful
commercial farmers, thus improving their standards of living. We  have  been
inspired by these masses  of  our  people  who  have  confidence  that  this
democratic Government will address their needs that have for  so  long  been
neglected, who understand that even if the road ahead  is  long,  change  of
necessity reaches some before others. We have  seen  inspiring  examples  of
what we can do to define ourselves  as  patriotic  South  Africans  who  are
prepared to work hard, even if it is on a small scale to make  a  difference
in the transformation process.

This confidence in the future, on the part of the very poor in our  country,
places a great responsibility  on  all  of  us  who  have  been  elected  to
represent these masses.  The  leadership  represented  in  this  House  must
occupy the frontline as we go beyond the tarred roads to work together  with
all our people to ensure that there are no impassable roads, that  there  is
no community in our country that is isolated from the rest  by  poverty,  by
underdevelopment and by inhuman suffering.

We  are  approaching  the  halfway  mark  of  our  national  and  provincial
parliaments and governments. Much commendable work has been  done  to  build
on the foundation laid  during  our  first  five  years  of  democracy.  The
results of this effort are visible to every honest person, both  inside  and
outside our country.

We have a clear view of what we should do further to advance  the  objective
of securing a better life for all our people.  We  have  put  the  necessary
institutions in place to enable us to achieve this objective.  What  remains
is for us to act with vigour and consistency to accelerate  the  process  of
progressive change.

We will do this better if we act together with the  masses  of  our  people,
relying  on  them  as  conscious  partners   in   the   struggle   for   the
reconstruction and development of our country. For this to happen,  we  must
go out to the people to  report  to  them,  to  assess  the  impact  of  our
policies and programmes, to listen to their  views,  especially  those  that
are critical of our performance, and to  interact  with  them  honestly  and
truthfully.

I trust that as the National Council of Provinces enters the second half  of
its life, it will take up this challenge  without  hesitation  and  help  us
further to improve our  system  of  democratic  governance  and  further  to
improve the lives of our people.

We have a duty to justify the confidence of the  masses  of  our  people  in
their elected legislatures and Government, to demonstrate  practically  that
their hopes for a better life are not misplaced.  In  the  words  of  Frantz
Fanon:


  To educate the masses politically does not mean, cannot  mean,  making  a
  political speech. What it means is to try, relentlessly and passionately,
  to teach the masses that everything depends on them; that if we  stagnate
  it is their responsibility, and that if we go forward it is due  to  them
  too.

I am certain that the National Council of Provinces  will  respond  to  this
challenge. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I now call upon hon Premier  Shilowa  of
the Gauteng province, and I alert him that he  is  first  because  ``g''  is
before every other letter in the names of provinces. [Laughter.]

The PREMIER OF GAUTENG (Mr  M  S  Shilowa):  Presidente  wa  Rhipabuliki  ra
Afrika Dzonga, Mutshami wa Xitulu na swandla swa  yena,  swirho  swa  yindlu
leyi leswi hloniphekaka, ndza mi losa. [The hon President  of  the  Republic
of South Africa, Chairperson and your deputies, hon members of  this  House,
I greet you.]

I did not say anything to Premier Molefe because my younger brother from  my
adopted province has said enough, and we agree that ... [Inaudible.]

As public representatives of the people of our country, we were elected  and
mandated to implement policies and programmes that  would  lead  to  overall
improvement in the quality of life of our citizens.  Working  together  with
them and the private sector, we need to ensure that  the  economy  grows  at
higher rates, creates new jobs and continues to develop into  a  modern  and
internationally competitive economy.

The  overwhelming  mandate  we  received  in  1994  and  1999   respectively
indicates their level of confidence in our ability to lead  the  process  of
change and steer our country to  its  destiny.  Having  placed  us  in  this
position of responsibility and  leadership,  they  did  not  abdicate  their
responsibility to work with us and to  give  us  the  necessary  support  to
ensure that we succeeded.  They  continue  to  influence  our  policies  and
programmes. And ensuring that we do not veer  from  the  path  to  a  better
South Africa is something they continue to do.

A challenge for us in Government is to ensure that  the  people  are  better
able to participate in our work and influence legislation-making and  policy
formulation and implementation. We are  obligated  to  create  possibilities
for the exchange of information within and among  communities,  and  between
Government and society.

The RDP-based document says:


  Open debate and  transparency  in  government  and  society  are  crucial
  elements of reconstruction and development. This requires an  information
  policy which guarantees active exchange of information and opinion  among
  all  members  of  society.  Without  the  free  flow  of   accurate   and
  comprehensive information, the RDP will lack the mass input necessary for
  its success.

This we agree with as the Gauteng provincial government. In Gauteng we  have
made communication and interaction with the people, on an ongoing basis,  an
integral part of our work. In our daily  work  we  seek  to  give  practical
meaning to the principle that says that government work is public work.

Dynamic and direct interaction and dialogue with our people where they  live
continues to be  a  permanent  feature  of  our  work.  This  people-centred
approach is a principle of democratic governance. It is  also  an  effective
mechanism to ensure that as Government  we  are  in  constant  communication
with our people,  that  we  indeed  address  their  needs,  that  we  remain
accountable to them, and that they are indeed able to impact  on  governance
and work with Government in addressing common challenges.

Tomorrow, 14 November 2001, the Gauteng executive council will  be  visiting
various communities to report back on work done since the beginning  of  the
year.  We  will  share  with  the  community  successes,  shortcomings   and
challenges. Together we will develop an  approach  to  ensure  change  at  a
faster pace.

Madam Chairperson, I hope you will ask the GPG delegates in  this  House  to
make available that report so that you too, together with  this  House,  are
able to help us improve on what we are doing or not doing.

During such  an  interaction,  we  will  together  with  communities  remind
ourselves of our priorities: priorities of a growing  economy  that  creates
sustainable jobs; of improved quality service delivery in areas  of  health,
education, social  welfare  and  housing;  of  greater  focus  to  create  a
nonracial, nonsexist, democratic and united country; and  of  ensuring  that
together we focus on a sustained youth and women developmental strategy.

But we are also hoping, together with them, to say together  that  at  least
as a province  we  understand  and  approach  issues  of  globalisation  and
economic matters not as matters of suspicion,  or  rather  of  superstition,
but as challenges posed by new production  forces,  the  new  way  in  which
capital flows and also in terms of  information  and  technology;  and  that
together we need to look at how  we  engage  in  a  manner  that  will  make
Gauteng a better place to live in for all our citizens. Above all,  we  will
recommit ourselves on how, as citizens, we  can  take  the  lead  in  social
transformation, thereby avoiding being bystanders in our own struggle.

In further  giving  effect  to  the  right  to  government  information  and
services, working with both local and national Government,  we  continue  to
service multipurpose community centres to serve the people  of  Gauteng,  as
the  President  himself  has  indicated.  So  far,  two  MPPCs   have   been
established, in Sebokeng and in Bronkhorstspruit.

Our approach to these community centres is underpinned by our commitment  to
ensuring effective provision of information and services to the citizens  of
Gauteng, particularly to the majority of our people  who  have  been  denied
historically this access. Access to information is key to enabling  all  our
citizens, particularly the poor and marginalised, to use  their  rights  and
to entrench a people-centred participatory democracy.

While the Government has a duty to inform, the media also has  an  important
role in facilitating exchange of information within and  among  communities,
and between the democratic Government and  society  as  a  two-way  process.
Many of our people rely on the mass media as a key  source  of  information.
For this reason we have continued  to  engage  with  the  media  on  how  to
improve their role in this regard.

We regard the media as an important stakeholder in Gauteng, and  we  believe
that it has an interest in securing a better future for our people  and  our
province. We also believe that the media  has  a  social  responsibility  to
provide citizens with information that will help to  improve  their  quality
of life. We will continue to  explore  areas  of  common  interest  in  this
regard.

Let me also indicate that on 15 November we  will  be  hosting  the  Gauteng
Intergovernmental Forum,  in  which  we  will  be  looking  at  the  Gauteng
Provincial Economic Strategy. We will  be  looking  at  the  local  economic
strategy based on the IDPs, and at how to realign both  the  provincial  and
the local economic strategies to better serve our  people  as  a  whole.  We
will also be looking at the challenges faced by a number  of  municipalities
for   service   delivery   both   inside   and   outside   of   cross-border
municipalities.

Lastly, we will be looking at how, together with them, we can  turn  Gauteng
into a construction site over the next three years. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE EASTERN CAPE (Rev M A Stofile): Chairperson of the  NCOP,
hon President of the Republic of South Africa, colleagues,  members  of  the
NCOP, let me first congratulate our colleague Popo Molefe on being  formally
elected as the rotating member of the NCOP, and I hope that one day he  will
be elected as the rotating member of the presidency of the NCOP.

The NCOP is a very important part of our  parliamentary  democracy,  and  as
such it needs people with  a  special  passion  for  parliamentary  systems,
procedures  and  programmes.   Our   public   representatives   have   these
characteristics in varying degrees. Our country is blessed to  have  a  fair
share of people with such a passion, and Popo Molefe is no  mean  member  of
such a group. We are very proud of him  and  absolutely  confident  that  he
will be able to make a contribution to improve the leadership of  the  NCOP,
and also to contribute towards a transformatory agenda of the NCOP  and  our
country. He comes from amongst  us.  He  is  one  of  us.  He  has  a  broad
understanding of the challenges of many decades that confront  our  country,
from the First World to the ``Fourth  World''  components  of  our  country.
Popo has a good grasp of this.

The President raised the challenges that confronted us as  we  went  to  the
local government elections at the end of 2000, and he correctly pointed  out
that the democratic structures that were put in place needed  to  be  strong
and properly resourced in order to be able to deliver the services  that  we
have spoken about so much. This is so  precisely  because  we  believe  that
they are at the cutting edge of  our  service  delivery,  and  as  such  all
personnel, as well as monetary resources, must be made  available  to  these
structures of our Government. They are also the key  to  the  transformation
of our society because they are in close proximity to the  people  who  want
to see this change rather than to hear about it.

We are pleased to agree with the President that since 5 December 2000 up  to
now, a lot of work has been done by the local government  structures.  Their
IDPs have been completed. They have not only been  completed  but  they  are
beginning to reveal the massive backlogs that these  spheres  of  government
should deal with.

While some strides have been made, it is clearly  indicated  in  those  IDPs
that there is still a lot that lies ahead of us. We have insisted that  they
should not just stop at the IDP level but go beyond  that  and  develop  the
LEDs that will make it possible for our people to improve their  lives  when
the communities have electricity, when the streets are tarred and  have  all
these facilities available; then they will also have the  income  that  will
assist them to pay  rates  that  are  so  important  for  municipalities  to
operate.

Our fortnightly outreach programmes, which are  now  in  their  third  year,
indicate by and large that our  people,  black  and  white,  are  very  well
disposed towards our programmes and plans. But they are not always aware  of
what  we  are  doing.  There  is  a  big  void  between  ourselves  and  the
communities in terms of communication and  the  flow  of  information.  They
understand our constraints even better than those  who  are  self-proclaimed
commentators on these things. But the advantage of talking to them  face  to
face is that it affords them  the  opportunity  to  ask  questions,  receive
answers and understand or refuse to understand, but at least they  are  able
to get a response.

We were in Mount Fletcher on 14 October, and  that  lady  who  was  shouting
under the tent ``o maaka, o maaka'' [``you lie,  you  lie'']  when  we  said
that we would tar R56, we saw her again last week.  She  was  the  first  to
come to us and said that the graders had arrived and the packs  for  tarring
these roads were even  in  their  yards.  She  apologised  for  saying  ``ke
Nongqawuse'' [``its impossible''] when we were there last time. [Applause.]

 The  private  sector,  from  home  and  abroad,  is  also  showing  growing
confidence in and appreciation of the sociopolitical stability in our  area.
To  that  extent,  they  continue  to  interact  with  us  with  a  view  to
identifying areas into which they can begin to plough their  investments  or
where they can partner with us in some of the projects that  are  so  sorely
needed in order to improve the situation of our communities.

The village meetings continue to influence our  own  budgetary  plans.  They
continue to influence our own priority lists because  every  time  one  goes
out to these villages,  one  learns  something  new,  and  they  also  learn
something  new.  And  that  symbiosis  of  learning  invariably  makes   the
necessary impact on our plans and priorities. Sometimes we find that all  of
our plans are based on the computer data, and not  on  the  reality  on  the
ground. This is encouraging, but it is also a daunting challenge.

We are pleased that our communities are being mobilised into being part  and
parcel of the planning machinery for their  own  development  in  their  own
localities. They  are  tired  of  being  the  objects  of  history  and  our
planning. They want to be part and parcel of these plans. They asked  us  at
Ramohlakwane last week: ``What is this Nepad  that  we  hear  the  President
talking about?'' That affords us the  opportunity  to  explaining  to  them,
rather than simply expect them to come on board on this new partnership.

They asked us the question:  ``What  is  this  Gear  that  creates  so  many
problems amongst yourselves, because if it is one of  the  five  gears,  you
can just shift to the one that is commensurate with all your  aspirations.''
[Laughter.] These questions sound like stupid questions, but they  are  very
simple and honest questions. When we respond, one can see  the  ironing  out
of the frowns on their brows, that at least something new is left behind  as
we take something new back to Bisho.

We are absolutely confident that, despite the size of the backlogs  and  the
constraints of our resources, we are absolutely on track and our people  are
with us. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mr President, hon members, we are very  pleased
to have with us in  the  public  gallery  a  delegation  from  the  National
People's Congress  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China.  [Applause.]  The
delegation is a parliamentary committee on  finance  and  economic  matters,
and has  been  engaging  with  our  committees  in  that  regard  on  common
business.
I now  invite  the  hon  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces, Mr Mushwana, to speak.

Mr M L MUSHWANA: Hon Chairperson, hon President, I will be speaking in  both
Xitsonga and English. Let me start by informing Premier  Molefe  that  I  am
very jealous of him, because he has taken over the rotating  Chairpersonship
from  my  premier,  the  Premier  of  the  Northern  Province.   [Laughter.]
Nevertheless, I welcome Comrade Popo Molefe  and  hope  he  will  bring  new
blood to the National Council of Provinces.

At the last workshop we held in the NCOP, many questions  were  asked  about
why we have a rotating Chairperson. What  is  actually  the  function  of  a
rotating Chairperson?  I  think,  with  regard  to  the  past  two  rotating
Chairpersons, I have not seen either one of them presiding anywhere  in  the
NCOP, and I think Comrade Popo will bring in new initiatives. [Laughter.]

Firstly, I would like to commend the hon the President for taking  time  out
of his congested schedule to be with us. We appreciate  the  fact  that  the
President did find time to be with us.

Ha ku amukela  hi  mandla  mambirhi.  Titwe  u  ri  kaya.  [We  welcome  you
wholeheartedly. Feel at home.]

We know that South Africa needs  the  President,  so  does  Africa  and  the
world. They all need his undivided attention, and they do  need  his  wisdom
on and vision of the new world of globalisation.

Globalisation, as it now turns out, makes the world a  small  colony  and  a
monopoly of rich countries. Unfortunately, globalisation is  here  to  stay,
and we  therefore  have  to  be  ready  for  it.  We  need  the  qualitative
leadership of the hon the President.

We know that the President's family and friends need him. We also  need  him
and are happy to have him in the House.

Vukona bya wena eka yiNdlu leyi yo hlawuleka swonghasi, byi hi endla hi  twa
hi xiximiwile naswona ha tinyungubyisa. [Your presence  in  this  honourable
House makes us feel highly honoured and we therefore feel very  proud  about
your presence.]

More importantly, I wish to thank the President for his challenging  speech,
the guidance it gives, the views it contains and  the  information  on  what
preoccupies the Government in its fervent quest to  provide  a  better  life
for all.

Most importantly, the President also leads some of those who  did  not  vote
for him, or who do not support him, those whose sole  public  and  community
responsibilities seems to be to criticise  the  President  for  whatever  he
does, good or bad; if anything the criticism is bad. They take offence  when
the President expresses his opinion; they claim to have better opinions.

Va ri ku vulavula i xongela n'wini. I vaxihanya-nomo, lavo dya va  tshamile.
Va tshovela laha va nga hlwanyangiki  kona.  [The  saying  goes  that  self-
praise is no recommendation, all they can do is pay lip-service,  they  just
want to sit and eat, and reap where they did not sow.]

They are not doing anything for the people. All they do is spend  all  their
time finding fault with the President. Those armchair critics  -  those  who
just found themselves free without knowing or  wanting  to  know  who  freed
them, or, for that matter, pretend not to know who  freed  them  -  we  know
them, we see them. Come Judgment Day, we will not be there to  assist.  Some
have their bodies in this country, but their souls and minds  are  wondering
across the seas in places I dare not mention.

Va swi lava, a va swi  lavi,  laha  hi  nga  fika  kona  a  ha  ha  thleleli
endzhaku. A va thelele, va ta hundzuka matshuka ya munyu. Whether they  like
it or not, we have reached the point of no return, and if  they  turn  back,
they are going to turn into pillars of salt.]

It would be naive if we did not thank the President for all the  initiatives
he has embarked upon to design and formulate programmes  and  strategies  to
rid Africa of its crippling poverty, isolation and backwardness.

The President started with Map. In the process, Map and Omega, which is  the
product of Senegal, merged and became the New Africa  Initiative.  Chemistry
led to the final product - Nepad. All these are the  bricks  and  mortar  on
top of the African Renaissance, another initiative the President  helped  to
rekindle. The gods have indeed  gone  into  a  deep  sleep,  enjoying  their
dreams, for in the President they saw success and therefore have nothing  to
fear.

Swikwembu swi etlele bya  tinhenha.  Swi  etlela  mugudzalala.  Swi  wisile.
Hinkwaswo leswi hi wona matimba ni migingiriko ya wena. The gods  have  gone
into a deep sleep, enjoying their dreams; they are resting. All this is  due
to your dedication and hard work in your activities.]

The President has just told us about Imbizo, which to me is  a  consultative
programme with people at the grass-roots level. This  programme  was  indeed
initiated by the President and his Government.

During our struggles we did say that the people shall govern,  and  that  we
will bring Parliament closer to  the  people.  Imbizo  does  just  that.  We
welcome this initiative.

Swa biha ku fambela evanhwini ntsena loko hi lava  leswaku  va  hi  hlawula.
Swa fanela leswaku hi tihlanganisa ni lava nga  hi  hlawula  leswaku  hi  ta
titwela hi ta hina tindleve leswi va karhataka, xikan'we ni ku twa leswi  va
navelaka leswaku hi va endlela swona. Hi amukela pfhumba  leri  hulumende  a
ri sunguleke naswona hi ta ri seketela. Ni  tolo  exivijweni  ku  kona  laha
swirhalanganya swi  rharhuliwaka  kona.  (Translation  of  Tsonga  paragraph
follows.)

[It is bad to interact with people only when we want them to  elect  us.  It
is appropriate to communicate with people who voted for us in order to  hear
with our own ears about things that are problematic to them  and  to  listen
to their aspirations in order to enable us to fulfil their needs. We  accept
the programme initiated by our Government and we are going  to  support  it.
Yesterday a meeting was held where problems were sorted out accordingly.]

May I also take this opportunity to thank the hon  premiers,  including  hon
acting premiers, for coming to the NCOP to  participate  in  this  important
debate. There can be no NCOP  without  provinces.  Our  special  thanks  and
appreciation also go to special delegates here present, and to Salga.

 We are looking forward to greater  participation  of  Salga  in  the  NCOP.
Salga has a much greater role to play in the NCOP, and  everything  must  be
done to assist Salga to improve its participation in  the  NCOP.  We  should
also help Salga in being given sufficient room to play a meaningful role  at
the provincial legislature.

We know that the NCOP, in my own terms,  is  a  lekgotla.  It  is  the  only
institution in which all three  spheres  of  government  come  together  and
debate matters of mutual interest, and it  brings  all  provinces  together.
Provinces are able to share ideas on best governance. The  NCOP  provides  a
forum  for  local  government,  through  Salga,  to  articulate  matters  of
interest to municipalities.  The  NCOP  can  therefore  be  defined  as  the
citadel of co-operative governance. But the question is: Is  the  NCOP  able
to satisfy its mandate?

We are happy to say that, in the end, the NCOP has finally  found  its  feet
in the lawmaking  process,  and  it  has,  at  all  costs,  tried  to  avoid
duplication of what transpires in the National Assembly, as was the case  in
the Senate. This happens because of your fine  leadership  qualities,  Madam
Chair, and we are proud to announce that the  NCOP,  as  I  have  said,  has
found its feet. More special delegates from the provinces  are  increasingly
playing a greater role in the NCOP. Topical matters  relating  to  provinces
have been discussed within the NCOP.
Recently, the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review  report  was,  for  the  first
time, tabled in the NCOP. The  report  was  subjected  to  intensive  public
hearings by the NCOP's select committees,  recommendations  were  made  and,
finally, a debate was held in the NCOP. Through the  IFR  we  were  able  to
assess performance of service delivery at the municipal level.

We admit that the NCOP has so far not been  fully  successful  in  terms  of
using this forum for public debates, as envisaged in  the  Constitution.  In
my  submission,  matters  such  as  boundary  disputes,  chieftainship,  and
participation of traditional leaders in local government  should  have  been
some of the matters to be debated in the NCOP rather than in the media.

We saw acrimonious debates on the role  of  traditional  leaders  and  local
government being waged in the newspapers. I have no qualms about the  media,
but what we are saying is that the Constitution provided a  mechanism  which
we are not utilising.
Talking and negotiation have brought South Africa where  it  is  today,  and
talking has managed to bring together  people  who  hated  one  another  but
whom, most unfortunately, history  and  geography  have  condemned  to  live
together.

Va ri ku vulavula ngopfu kumbe ku dya ngopfu a hi ku hlula  ndlala.  Timhaka
kumbe mabulu a swi heli, ku hela nkarhi. Ndzi  ta  gimeta  kwala  [Swandla.]
(Translation of Tsonga paragraph follows.)

[A lengthy speech may not achieve any goal; a lot could be said, but due  to
time constraints, I would like  to  end  my  speech  by  saying  thank  you.
[Applause.]]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, Mr President, the  question  that  every  South
African, especially public representatives,  must  find  an  answer  to  for
himself or herself is: What is the  effect  of  my  daily  actions  and  the
choices I make on the future of - in the  case  of  every  South  African  -
myself, my family, those closest and dearest to  me,  my  business,  my  job
and, in the case of politicians especially, also the effect  on  the  future
of our country and those that we represent in Parliament?

Can it, in present-day South  Africa,  be  in  the  best  interests  of  our
country and the people that we represent  to  practice  fightback  politics.
We, in the New NP, say no  to  that  kind  of  politics.  It  is,  in  fact,
counterproductive to the interests of voters and minority  groups.  It  will
not achieve anything, and it certainly will not contribute  to  the  solving
of the problems of our country, for example the unacceptably high  level  of
crime, poverty, HIV/Aids, joblessness, etc.

We say that we must help to make the new South Africa work. We  must  build,
not fight back. South  Africa  and  Africa  have  had  enough  of  fighting.
[Interjections.]  As  former  President   Nelson   Mandela   said   in   his
inauguration speech, ``This is the time to heal the old wounds and  build  a
new South Africa''.

This, of course, does not mean  that  we  should  not  criticise.  It  does,
however, mean that when we criticise we should criticise in  a  constructive
way and offer solutions. This means that we must take  coresponsibility  for
the future of our country and our continent. We,  therefore  derive  no  joy
from any failure of the Government, but we are filled with  joy  when  there
are successes.

This approach is spelt out in our election manifesto of 1999, as follows:


  The New NP says yes to government where provision is made for  multiparty
  government, representing all  communities  and  where  responsibility  is
  shared to make South  Africa  work;  where  opposition  parties  are  not
  relegated to the sterile and negative role of critics, but  are  regarded
  as constructive players in the political system.

We did our best to get the DA to accept a  more  constructive  approach  and
although it seemed we had some success in the beginning, the  DA  fell  back
into the fightback mode. [Interjections.] The reports of last Sunday and  of
Die Burger of today say our approach will  have  to  show  tangible  results
before the next election if we want to succeed at the polls. We accept  this
challenge. It is with this in mind that I, as I did during this debate  last
year, again turn to the question of crime and the unacceptably  high  levels
thereof in our country.

Although this is but one of the several extremely important challenges  that
face our country, I believe that if we can solve this problem, the  solution
to many of our other problems will fall into place. I, and  I  believe  most
if not all of us, of course also have a passion for the personal safety  and
security of all our people.

I am glad that the presidency has been able  to  provide  an  answer  to  my
question in terms of measurable goals and timeframes  for  the  lowering  of
our crime levels by way of the reply of the  Deputy  President  to  my  oral
question on 30 October this year when he  said  that  the  stabilisation  of
crime levels was targeted to take place in the period of 2001 to  2003,  and
that  the  normalisation  of  crime  levels,   compared   to   international
standards, was targeted to take place in the period of 2003 to 2009.

In a follow-up question I asked the Deputy President whether  it  would  not
be possible to reduce by half the period during which it was envisaged  that
the levels of crime would be reduced to international standards.  Obviously,
I did not get a definite answer then as this is something that will have  to
be looked at very carefully again before such an answer can be given.

I want to ask the President today, as our head of state, to please  consider
ordering an investigation into the  possibility  of  realistically  bringing
the date for the achievement of internationally acceptable levels  of  crime
forward to the end of 2005 instead  of  the  end  of  2009.  This  will,  of
course, entail a proper analysis as to what is  required  by  the  different
departments and those departments involved in  poverty  relief,  because  we
will only be able to sustain lower levels of crime if  we  also  succeed  in
effectively addressing poverty.

It is also important what it will  cost,  but  money  spent  wisely  on  the
effective prevention and combating of crime is the best  investment  we  can
make. The dividends will be extraordinarily good. If  we  succeed  we  would
have saved many thousands of innocent lives. We would  have  prevented  many
thousands of women and children being raped, and many thousands of  innocent
people from being brutally assaulted and maimed. We would  also  have  saved
our country and our citizens many billions of rand. We would have  attracted
many extra  billions  of  rand  in  direct  investment  and  we  would  have
attracted thousands more tourists. We would have also succeeded  in  getting
our economy to grow much faster and have created  many  thousands  more  job
opportunities. We would be able to address poverty much better, and be  able
to create a much safer and better life for all our people.

I refuse to believe that this is an impossible dream. Many  of  the  reasons
why we are not succeeding are within our control. If  we  succeed,  we  will
also prove to our people that constructive engagement is the  only  kind  of
politics that works and is effective in South Africa. It does  not  help  to
shout from the sidelines. The only way is to get onto the building site  and
start building. We accept coresponsibility for the future  of  our  country.
We will therefore devote all our energy  to  making  South  Africa  work  in
order to create a better life for all our people.

We can, we must and we  will  with  passion  play  a  constructive  role  in
building our country and our continent, not only because  it  is  the  right
thing to do, but because it is in the best interests of all  South  Africa's
people.

Now is the time to take hands and to build a new, just, safe and  prosperous
South Africa that we are all  longing  for  and  that  all  our  people  are
longing for. It is within our reach. We owe  it  to  those  who  have  given
their lives for a new and better South Africa.  We  owe  it  to  our  fellow
citizens and children and all the  people  and  children  of  Africa.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE NORTH WEST (Mr P S Molefe): Madam Chair, I have a  little
more confidence now because  I  speak  as  the  rotating  Deputy  Chair,  or
revolving Deputy Chair. [Laughter.]

Colleagues and Mr President, thank you very much for this privilege.  Before
1994, South Africans spent a lot of time grappling with the question of  how
we could create a democratic state and what nature of  democracy  we  wanted
in our country. We went through the processes  of  the  Codesa  negotiations
and then the elections that took place. Thus our concept  of  democracy  had
been created. But the challenge continues, and it is one of  giving  meaning
to that democracy to the ordinary people.  That  meaning  goes  beyond  just
allowing them to participate in an election.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the President  for  providing
vision, which keeps us focused on those issues  that  are  our  business  as
leaders of the people, and on those issues that are closest  to  the  hearts
of our people.

Almost two years ago the national Cabinet began to introduce the concept  of
imbizos, which is a particular style  of  governance  that  promotes  active
involvement of the public not only in the implementation  of  programmes  of
Government, but also in the shaping  of  those  programmes  that  Government
then brings to the people.

In doing so, this facilitated direct  interaction  between  the  politicians
and the ordinary people. In a sense it also concretised two dicta, one  that
says ``The people shall govern'', and a second that says ``Hear us; let  the
people speak.'' That is what we  are  really  trying  to  do  through  these
imbizos - to realise that.

This also assists us in bringing about  public  accountability;  not  public
accountability through the Auditor-General  or  through  the  newspapers  or
through what the opposition parties say in the Chambers of  Parliament,  but
public accountability as  demanded  by  the  ordinary  people,  educated  or
uneducated, people who derive the questions that they raise about issues  of
accountability  from  their  own  direct  experience,  from  their  concrete
reality.

The imbizo therefore is a way in which we implemented a norm  of  government
- how new government should operate - and  how  to  do  so  on  a  continual
basis. There are certain selected periods when we do this.  In  a  sense  we
are also creating an opportunity to report  to  the  people  throughout  the
country in the same way that we report  to  the  legislators.  We  now  also
report to the people. We are doing so through Cabinet Ministers,  MECs,  the
President, the Deputy President, and premiers.  The  councillors  have  also
bought into this concept. They go  into  the  communities  to  talk  to  the
people about what they are doing and about the concerns of the people.

That achieves another objective, that of ending  what  appeared  to  be  the
dichotomy between  the  local  and  provincial  sphere  government  and  the
national sphere of government. When we  discussed  the  elections  of  2005,
there was the problem of the local sphere of Government  being  regarded  as
an unwanted child in the family of governments. We now are  emphasising  the
message that says that we belong together, we are one government,  but  with
three spheres. In a sense this is also bringing about a kind  of  confidence
in and respect for local government.

The imbizo concept also achieves another strategic and important  principle,
and that is the principle of a new patriotism, which the President  and  the
former president have been raising consistently. The principle says that  if
we want to build a new South Africa, we have to work together. But, for  the
masses to  work  together,  they  must  understand  what  it  is  that  this
Government wants to do, what its problems are, and become part of  resolving
those problems. They have to understand what resources are available in  the
whole country to deal with those problems.

This also empowers our communities, because  it  puts  them  in  a  position
where they cannot be manipulated by populist  charlatans,  who  simply  want
immediate political gain, but  who  are  not  interested  in  a  sustainable
programme to resolve the problems of the people. When the people  understand
what challenges they face in the country, no one  can  manipulate  us.  This
interaction with the masses therefore provides us with that opportunity.

Our province is divided into districts and we have already  held  successful
imbizos in the four  districts.  Together  with  Ministers  and  the  Deputy
President we listened to the masses of our  people.  They  spoke  fearlessly
and confidently about the successes and failures of Government.

The imbizos were based on projects. We felt we should not  just  be  talking
about plans, but launching and unveiling projects, which have  already  been
started, and announcing new ones which are coming to indicate to the  people
that things are happening. We dealt with issues  like  basic  services  that
have to be extended to  people,  problems  of  economic  transformation  and
growth, and issues of unemployment.

The imbizos play the very important  role  of  bringing  together  different
role-players in our society, once again, therefore, engendering a  sense  of
common purpose  among  all  groupings  in  our  society.  All  of  them  are
committed to a single programme of improving the lives of our people.

The imbizo programme gave us a platform to further cement  the  relationship
between Government and traditional  leaders.  The  traditional  leaders  saw
themselves as very much part of the unfolding drama  of  transformation  and
development of their  own  communities.  They  did  not  see  themselves  as
spectators on the sidelines. They were  very  much  part  of  it,  and  they
provided  leadership  and  guidance  to  Government   and   to   their   own
communities.

What it also emphasised, as the President said, is the need  for  integrated
service  delivery,  the  need  for  integrated  planning,   the   need   for
integration in implementing our plans  with  traditional  leaders,  national
Government, provincial government and local government.

Indeed, as Premier Shilowa  said,  it  also  challenges  us,  as  provincial
governments  and  national  Government,  to  realise  that  the   integrated
development plans of municipalities are  not  something  divorced  from  the
overall national plan of implementing programmes in the country.  They  must
be very much part of the national and provincial plans in  order  to  ensure
that we do not parachute into a municipality to implement  what  we  call  a
national or provincial programme, as if a  municipality  has  got  no  plans
about issues and challenges that are facing it. I think,  increasingly,  the
President is bringing about that realisation to all of  us  that  we  cannot
operate like that. We have to be different, but interdependent. We  have  to
be distinctive, and co-operative. I think this is  what  is  happening,  and
this is what we are doing.

The programmes we are implementing  are  linked  directly  to  the  specific
challenges that each party defined when it ran its election  campaign.  Here
we  talk  about  poverty,  crime,  unemployment  and  underdevelopment.  The
imbizos, therefore, provide us with the opportunity to  work  together  with
our people in implementing all those programmes. This shifts  the  focus  of
our people from dabbling with political slogans to real issues  that  affect
the lives of the people on a day-to-day basis. It also says  that  democracy
must be something that gives hope to our people that tomorrow life  will  be
better than it has been today. They must be able to say so  because  of  the
answers they get both in terms of the words they hear and in  terms  of  the
programmes that they see us implementing. It also empowers our people, as  I
indicated earlier on.

We are thus delighted to  be  very  much  part  of  this  programme  of  the
imbizos. Our exco has been roving, going to various parts of  the  province.
We hold our meetings together in communities with the district councils  and
municipalities to make sure that when we go to the people we do so  together
and address these problems. I think this has deepened our  understanding  of
the challenges that are facing our country and our province. It allowed  the
ordinary people to engage us, to fill us in and also to guide us.

I think the whole concept  of  Multipurpose  Community  Centres,  which  the
national Government has started in  collaboration  with  the  provinces,  is
going quite a long way in ending the digital divide and ensuring that  rural
people can also access technology in rural parts of our provinces.  It  also
assists our people in accessing information and, at  the  same  time,  gives
information to the various levels of government and the various leaders  who
are leading them because, as much as leaders are  providing  vision  to  the
people, the people themselves  are  shaping  the  vision  that  the  leaders
provide to the people. They inform that vision, because a vision  that  does
not reflect the wishes of the people and a concrete  reality  is  a  useless
vision. It is unrealistic, and  a  superstition,  as  one  of  the  previous
speakers said.

The President has therefore ensured that we interact  with  our  people.  He
has ensured that the vision we provide is a  vision  that  is  shaped  by  a
concrete reality and the wishes of our people.

I think the challenge facing the NCOP is one of monitoring to see  how  this
whole concept of integrated planning and integration  is  being  implemented
in the provinces. As it  plays  its  monitoring  and  legislative  roles  it
should do so with a proper understanding of how things  are  being  done  in
the various provinces by all the  nine  provinces.  They  should  understand
that the whole advent of developmental local government meant that  we  have
a collective responsibility  to  co-ordinate  the  strength  of  that  local
government  in  order  for  it  to  be  effective,  good,  transparent   and
accountable. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE FREE STATE (Ms I W Direko):  Chairperson,  because  I  do
not have a sister premier, like Premier Shilowa is to  Premier  Molefe,  who
can make congratulatory remarks to me, I will have to do it myself.
It is exciting that we are seven years into our democracy  and  that  at  no
stage has our democracy been held to ransom.  The  smooth  election  of  our
second Deputy Chairperson is indicative of that.  I  do,  however,  wish  to
salute the sterling contribution made by the  outgoing  second  Chairperson,
even if he did not chair at any point. [Interjections.]

His advice on the quiet has helped to make the NCOP a better  representative
of provinces. And by the way, there are still people  who  will  not  accept
that the NCOP is a very important organ of Government, because it keeps  us,
ordinary  people  of  the  provinces,  informed  of  developments.   We   do
appreciate the immense amount of work that he has  put  into  liaising  with
provinces. Even if he did not sit in that maroon chair, he  still  made  his
contributions behind the scenes.

I wish to convey my sincere congratulations  to  the  newly  elected  second
Deputy Chairperson, the hon Popo Molefe. His experience and  willingness  to
serve his people will enrich this office immensely. Good luck  on  the  road
ahead. [Interjections.]

Participatory democracy was  thought  to  be  impractical  in  South  Africa
before the democratic Government came into  office.  Today  this  Government
has proven that people have a serious role  to  play  in  determining  their
fate. Establishing institutions that  enhance  democracy  was  also  another
indication of our seriousness about making people part of governance.

The President and his Cabinet are a source of inspiration to provinces  with
their willingness to go to the ordinary people in the streets to  listen  to
and hear their problems and needs. The Imbizo campaign must  be  an  ongoing
process as it combines the three tiers of government. We are  able  to  work
together, and the impact is immense.

In the Free State we have taken our executive council  around  the  province
in an attempt to bring the government closer to the people. In all the  five
districts of the province, imbizo activities were arranged  throughout  last
week, and both MECs and  councillors  participated  fully  in  ensuring  the
imbizos' success wherever we went.

In terms of the President's message, it is important  to  realise  that  the
ivory tower type of government has no place in our new democracy. It is  the
common government, what I  call  ``airport''  type  of  government  that  is
successful. This means that when you sit at the airport, regardless  of  who
you  are  or  what  your  status  is,  information  comes  to  you   through
loudhailers, and you know exactly what is happening, which plane  is  taking
off and when.

 It thus becomes incumbent on us, as representatives in Government, to  make
sure that we are on the ground - even planes take off from  the  ground  ...
[Laughter.]  and  that  we   liaise   with   our   people   all   the   way.
[Interjections.] The President's wise advice that communities  must  receive
our focus throughout, and not only at election time,  is  appreciated.  They
want answers. They must be part of the process  throughout,  because  people
refuse to be regarded as  voting  cattle.  It  is  important  that  ordinary
people know what happens in Government all the  way,  and  as  a  Government
that has committed itself to being transparent, it is absolutely  imperative
that we go out to our people and tell them where we are, what we  have  done
and the reasons for failing to do what we ought to have done.

In pursuit of this programme, the hon the Deputy President will be  visiting
the people of Xhariep district  in  our  province  later  this  month.  This
district is one of the poorest in our province, and someone of the  hon  the
Deputy President's stature will visit that area. The Deputy President is  in
the position that he  is  in  because  of  Xhariep,  a  small  insignificant
community, and therefore it is important that the  Deputy  President  speaks
to them face to face. That is what  we  do  about  our  Government.  We  are
saying at this point that others should join us. Even the  opposition  -  or
what is left of it - must join us. [Interjections.]

It is not only enough for Government to go to the people,  but  the  crucial
point is: What  is  the  Government  doing  to  address  the  needs  of  our
communities? These are some of the questions that come up that  we  need  to
reply to honestly to tell the people  why  we  have  not  been  able  to  do
certain things that we ought to have done.

The partnership between the national Government, the  provincial  government
and the local government has already  achieved  a  first  in  terms  of  the
implementation of the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme  in
the Thabo Mofutsanyani district, which  is  our  nodal  point  in  the  Free
State. We have now  identified  about  12  projects  which  will  contribute
significantly to the eradication of poverty. By the way, in case  the  House
does not know what I mean when I say Thabo Mofutsanyani, it is  the  dumping
ground of the previous Government; Qwa-Qwa,  where  everybody  who  was  not
Tswana and did not go to Mafikeng was dumped.

The Fikapatso project includes the construction of  water  treatment  works.
The arts and craft  market  at  the  Basotho  Cultural  Village  is  another
project that will enable people to become their own employers, and  this  is
what people want. They do not want to be begging all the way  -  that  takes
away their self-respect and human dignity. Traditional leaders  have  always
been there, and they will  continue  to  be  there,  so  we  give  them  the
recognition that they deserve and bring  them  on  board  to  assist  us  in
whatever activities we are involved in in improving the quality of  life  of
a given place in the Free State. Trade unions  are  brought  on  board,  the
private sector and many more.

The provincial government has facilitated  the  formation  of  a  provincial
structure of religious  leaders  with  the  purpose  of  involving  them  in
leading the moral regeneration of our  society.  Religious  leaders  in  the
past  made  great  inputs  in  the  fight  against  apartheid,  and  in  our
democratic Government we cannot and must not forget  about  them.  With  the
help of our people, our efforts towards co-operative  governance  will  reap
fruit and the people will become beneficiaries.  The  developmental  process
that we are following was an attempt to alleviate poverty  and  improve  the
lives of our people and cannot unfold without the  involvement  of  all  our
people.

We must remember that our people insist on being  involved.  They  are  like
our disabled people, who say: Nothing for  us  without  us.  People  on  the
ground say no decisions should be taken without them, and  that  is  why  we
take the trouble of taking Government  to  the  people,  going  out  to  the
people and involving them in all decision-making.

Our  attempt  to  build  a  new  Free  State  is  encompassed  within   this
developmental process on the road to a new nationhood and a new  patriotism.
It is also encouraging to  see  that  our  national  political  scenario  is
getting towards that common nationhood. The writing  is  on  the  wall  that
there can be only one South Africa and that everybody, regardless of  colour
or  political  affiliation,  is  a  South  African.  Thank  goodness  it  is
happening in our lifetime.

 It is also encouraging that  our  national  political  scenario  is  moving
towards a common nationhood. I wish to salute all those who are working  day
and night to realise this long-cherished goal, and with all  of  us  working
together, there is no reason South Africa should not become a  country  that
can take its rightful place in the global village with pride and dignity.

I would like to thank hon Premier Popo for  listening  to  me  so  intently.
[Applause]

Die  WAARNEMENDE  PREMIER  VAN  WESKAAP  (Mnr  C  B  Herandien):   Mnr   die
Voorsitter, agb President, ek wil ten eerste sterk  beswaar  maak  teen  die
Swepe omdat hulle my laat praat direk na so 'n ervare spreker.  Dit  is  nie
reg nie. Maatjies maak  nie  so  nie.  [Gelag.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[The ACTING PREMIER OF THE WESTERN CAPE (Mr C B HERANDIEN): Mr  Chairperson,
hon President, in the first place I want to raise strong objections  to  the
Whips, because they want me to speak straight  after  such  an  accomplished
speaker. It is not fair. Buddies don't do that. [Laughter.]]
Allow me also to add  my  congratulations  to  the  newly  elected  rotating
Deputy Chairperson.  I  know  for  a  fact  that  the  new  rotating  Deputy
Chairperson will serve his term of office with dignity.  There  is  a  long-
standing convention in Parliament that, in one's  maiden  speech,  one  must
try at all times not to be controversial, and I will try to adhere  to  that
convention. [Interjections.] On the other hand, the  House  will  appreciate
that I received very short notice  of  this  meeting.  So,  I  ask  the  hon
members to bear with me because  I  will  try  my  best  to  adhere  to  the
convention. [Interjections.]

I am pleased that the topic of public service delivery, both internally  and
externally, has been highlighted for discussion today. It is  without  doubt
a subject that remains close to the heart of  the  Western  Cape  provincial
government.

Although GCIS figures show that the Premier of the Western  Cape  made  more
than twice as many public appearances as other premiers in South  Africa,  a
survey indicated  that  the  people  of  the  Western  Cape  held  a  common
perception that the provincial government was nevertheless unresponsive  and
invisible. For this reason, the Western Cape provincial government  launched
a campaign to address the issue of service delivery. Project Open  Door  was
created, and manifests itself in a number of ways, including Cabinet  visits
throughout the province.

It also found  expression  in  a  special  initiative  designed  to  improve
communication between the Western Cape government and  its  electorate.  The
first part of the campaign over a period of two months sees print and  radio
advertisements and public relations activities which invite people to  raise
issues with their government. This the public is doing  through  the  medium
of a professional call centre  between  the  hours  of  9h00  and  18h00  on
weekdays. The call centre is able to take calls in  isiXhosa,  English,  and
Afrikaans, and the message we bring to everyone in the Western Cape  is:  We
are listening.

I am very pleased to be able to tell the President that so far the  campaign
is proving to be successful and well worth the effort,  notwithstanding  the
current political issues in the Western Cape.

We can be forgiven for not having the  budget  capacity  to  launch  massive
housing projects across the country,  or  for  not  being  able  to  provide
financial security to every aged person in South Africa,  or  even  for  not
being able to make drugs freely available to Aids  sufferers,  but  we  must
take great care to ensure that we  do  not  fail  to  communicate  with  the
people of South Africa.

That is one area where we can ensure better service delivery. It is an  area
which is not dependent on huge budgets. Service delivery is as dependent  on
open communication with the people  of  South  Africa  as  is  the  physical
aspect, such as the delivery of housing. The same can be  said  of  internal
service delivery.

Whilst on the subject of budget and its  consequences  on  defining  service
delivery capacities, I ask for the President's indulgence  as  I  raise  the
matter of the census and the impact  this  would  undoubtedly  have  on  the
Western Cape, should it fail to touch everyone. Indications  in  some  areas
are that a mere 65% of the people have been visited by a census  enumerator.
The hon the President  would  appreciate  the  significance  this  has  with
regard to our ability to serve the needs of the people in our province.

Service delivery is something we need to practise internally with  diligence
and mutual respect in  order  to  be  effective  in  the  business  of  good
governance. At this moment in time, South  Africans  across  the  board  are
feeling heightened levels of concern over international matters such as  the
war in Afghanistan and its effects on the world economy.

On the local front our people are caught in a pincer movement between  ever-
rising costs and a growing perception that we are  failing  to  deliver.  In
the Western Cape recent political issues have  exacerbated  matters,  adding
considerably to the perception that gave rise to  the  need  to  launch  the
Open Door campaign in the first place.

We are cognisant of the need to project a  positive  image  to  the  outside
world and not only to the people of South Africa. In this regard, I want  to
assure the President that the Western Cape provincial government  will  work
together with all the other provinces on a  consultative  basis  to  achieve
common goals in this respect. This forum is seen as  an  ideal  platform  to
work together and to avoid dictatorial influences  which  will  distract  us
from such worthwhile common objectives.

In the same breath, may I also  take  this  opportunity  to  appeal  to  the
President for his intervention, particularly  in  highly  sensitive  matters
such as land restitution. To the vast majority of  South  Africans,  service
delivery is interpreted as meaning only two  things:  land  restitution  and
employment. Project Open Door is just the start of what  we  would  like  to
see become a regular feature of government in South  Africa.  Every  day  we
are being reminded through the media, through crime statistics  and  through
our historical legacies of the awesome task  before  us.  Let  us  not  fail
where we have no excuse for failure. [Applause.]

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, hon President, it is an honour and  a  privilege
to participate in a presidential debate on a critical issue such  as  public
participation. An important debate such as this provides a perfect  platform
where issues that still affect the meaningful participation of  rural  women
in our public  life  can  be  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  national
executive.

Over the last decade there has been considerable  focus  by  Government  and
civil society on strengthening the participation of women  in  our  law  and
policy-making  processes.  In  pursuance  of  this   objective,   Parliament
established a number of gender machineries,  including  The  Office  on  the
Status of Women, whose main mandate is to support gender  mainstreaming  and
monitor  this  within  Government  departments;  the  Commission  on  Gender
Equality, whose main functions are spelt out in the  Constitution;  and  the
Joint Monitoring Committee on the Improvement of Quality of Life and  Status
of Women, whose role is to oversee that legislation and policies brought  to
Parliament are gender responsive.

In addition, a number of laws dealing with issues such as the  promotion  of
equality and prevention of unfair discrimination, recognition  of  customary
marriages,   maintenance,   domestic   violence,   employment   equity   and
affirmative action have been passed by Parliament.

Although we might not have reached the desired levels  of  participation,  a
cursory glance at the level of women's representation in  institutions  such
as Parliament, provincial legislatures, municipal councils and  the  broader
Public Service is evidence of a commitment to enhance the  participation  of
women in our legislative and policy processes.

While we must acknowledge the immense gains that have  been  made  by  women
since 1994, we should not avoid the  realities  which  are  still  hindering
meaningful public participation by women,  especially  those  in  our  rural
areas.

Poverty, unemployment, pressures of time for  many  rural  women  who  work,
inadequate  transport,   inadequate   communication   facilities   such   as
telephones and televisions in rural households, and a high  illiteracy  rate
are some of the main obstacles inhibiting the  meaningful  participation  of
rural women in our national political life.

The central question we must  ask  ourselves  is:  How  do  we  enhance  the
participation of rural women in the political and legislative  processes  of
Government? What kind of mechanisms  do  we  need  in  order  to  creatively
respond  to  challenges  facing   rural   women   in   respect   of   public
participation?

A good starting point would be to critically  assess  the  effectiveness  of
the strategies employed by our national  gender  machineries  in  advocating
greater awareness of the plight of our rural  women  and  in  creating  more
opportunities for rural women to participate  in  Government  processes.  We
should honestly ask  ourselves  if  these  instruments  are  placing  enough
emphasis on rural women and whether we do  not  need  realignment  of  their
priorities and  programmes  to  place  greater  emphasis  on  enhancing  the
participation of rural women in our legislative and policy processes.

Another important way in which we can ensure  greater  public  participation
by rural women is by  taking  Parliament  to  our  rural  areas.  The  Joint
Monitoring Committee received an  overwhelming  response  from  rural  women
when  it  visited  them  as  part  of  Parliament's  aim  to   enhance   the
participation of rural women  in  the  legislative  processes  during  April
2001.

As members of Parliament  we  must  ensure  that  this  interaction  between
Parliament and rural communities  is  an  ongoing  process,  because  it  is
through activities such as these that we will be able to inform rural  women
of opportunities that exist in order for them to become involved in  shaping
Government policies to their benefit.

follows.)

[Provinces have a significant role to play  in  making  women  part  of  the
Government's programmes, especially those in the rural  areas.  It  is  time
all  nine  provinces  formed  committees  that  will  be  tasked  with   the
development of women. I am referring  to  parliamentary  committees  on  the
improvement of quality of life and status of women. That way women  will  be
able to be part of the programmes of the legislatures with  regard  to  what
concerns women.

I congratulate  the  Northern  Province  because  it  has  a  fully  fledged
committee which deals with  women's  needs.  I  hope  other  provinces  will
follow suit. [Interjections.]]

In particular, it will have an important  oversight  function  in  terms  of
assessing and making recommendations on  provincial  programmes,  which  are
aimed  at  increasing  the  participation  of  rural  women  in   provincial
legislative and  policy  processes.  In  creating  a  new  system  of  local
government, it has also opened the door to increased participation by  rural
women in government processes. It provides  a  unique  opportunity  for  our
gender machineries to influence policy decision-making at local level.

In this regard, we need to ask ourselves: How effectively are  we  utilising
local government to address the problems faced by rural  women  in  relation
to public participation? More  importantly:  How  are  the  national  gender
machineries positioning themselves in  Government's  Integrated  Sustainable
Rural Development Strategy, so as to provide a  voice  for  rural  women  in
this process? These are some of the important questions  which  we,  in  the
national gender machineries, need to find solutions  to.  We  cannot  always
expect to get answers from Government to these questions.

In conclusion, I want to touch on the issue of resources. The allocation  of
adequate resources is central to the effective and efficient functioning  of
our national, provincial and local gender machineries. If we  want  to  give
an effective voice to rural women, we will need the resources to do so.

While we still do not have adequate  resources,  it  is  important  that  we
maximise those resources that we do, in fact, have. One way  of  doing  this
is to ensure closer co-operation between  our  national  gender  machineries
and those on provincial and local levels. In this way, we will  be  able  to
put together existing resources and direct spending to areas where they  are
needed most, namely in increasing the public participation  of  rural  women
in our national political life. [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, your Excellency the  President,  hon  members
from provinces and colleagues, South Africa is poised to be  at  the  centre
of the next civilisation. The world believes in us. We,  too,  must  believe
in ourselves more than we have ever done. Our firm belief  in  ourselves  as
well as our firm belief in what we have set out to  do  will  enable  us  to
create the centre of this new civilisation.

South Africa is made up of those who have their future in  their  own  hands
and those who cannot help themselves. Of those who cannot  help  themselves,
there are many who  are  involved  in  crime.  These  people  terrorise  the
communities in which they live. They bring local businesses to their  knees,
destroy social coherence, discourage tourists and discourage investors  from
bringing money into the country. South Africa's destiny lies in the  answers
we provide in respect of people  who  cannot  lift  themselves  out  of  the
conditions which they are in.

If four bulls in a span of eight will not move, the whole span  comes  to  a
standstill. Who are the people in our country who  cannot  help  themselves?
Is their misfortune of their own making or is it  that  the  Government  and
society are failing them? We remind ourselves  that  we  promised  a  better
life for all. Are we delivering on any of these promises? If not,  what  are
the reasons for  a  very  large  number  of  people  remaining  outside  the
economic circle?

These questions confront every one  of  us  in  every  political  party.  We
cannot shift the blame this way or that. If work opportunities  are  scarce,
can we not use  the  large  pool  of  available  labour  for  infrastructure
development? Can we  not  create  100  000  more  opportunities  for  market
gardeners? Can we not also  accelerate  SMMEs  so  that  spinners,  weavers,
dyers, clothing market crafters, potters and so on flourish?

Our Government can pat itself on the back for many of its achievements.  The
one area to which much more attention needs to  be  given  is  the  area  of
unemployment. Even if two or three new Deputy Ministers were appointed  with
the specific purpose of reversing unemployment, we would be doing well.

We have a growing crisis on  our  hands  and  we  need  to  dedicate  Deputy
Ministers to striving night and day to turn things around.  If  we  do,  our
country is headed for greatness and our leaders will be long  remembered  in
history. We dare not fail this challenge.  Indeed,  we  must  not  fail  it.
Together, with strength and purpose,  with  unity  and  commitment,  we  can
reverse joblessness and hopelessness. Let us do it. Let us create  a  better
life for all as we solemnly undertook to  do.  God  gives  us  strength  and
support.

Siyakhala  baba,  ukudlwengulwa  kwezingane  kwandile  futhi   ukudlwengulwa
kwabadala kakhulu, izalukazi impela esezixhilibe kakhulu, kwandile.  Sidinga
ukuthi kubuyiswe ukuqiniswa kwesithunzi samakhosi ethu ukuze kume leli  zwe.
Uxoshindlala kufanele asize  wonke  umuntu.  Phambili  ngomqondo  we  mbizo,
phambili! Amalungu Ahloniphekile: Phambili! (Translation of Zulu  paragraphs
follows.)

[We are saying child rape has increased, as well  as  the  rape  of  elderly
people, especially grandmothers. We need to have the status of the  amakhosi
strengthened so that this country will stand still. The Xoshindlala  project
should help everybody. Forward with the idea of the imbizo, forward!

HON MEMBERS: Forward!]

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, Mr President, hon premiers and members,  we  have
many problems in the Eastern Cape, but the  Eastern  Cape  is  also  a  very
proud and unique province. The President's family family roots and those  of
the ANC lie in my province. My roots, the so-called white  Afrikaans  tribe,
and those of disillusioned Voortrekker leaders like Piet Retief and  others,
lie in this province.

The President's party, as well as  the  Voortrekkers  many  years  ago  were
unhappy with government and they acted to free their  people  from  tyranny,
my people from British rule and the President's people from apartheid  rule.
Let us say that the birth and the growth of the  President's  party  can  be
traced back to the Eastern Cape. Allow me to say that the  decline  and  the
eventual demise of the once mighty white NP can also be traced back  to  the
Eastern Cape. In the Eastern Cape, we play hard. We play  ruthless,  but  we
like fair play. There is no need for me to stress our  problems,  the  House
is only too aware of them.

Let me highlight only two things we would like  to  achieve  in  making  the
playing fields equal and in fair play being allowed in  my  province.  First
of all, greater efforts  are  needed  to  bring  jobs  and  dignity  to  the
millions of people in the Eastern Cape. Secondly, urban crime, farm  murders
and all  firearm-originated  incidents  must  be  dealt  with  severely  and
eradicated. Our country is losing jobs faster  than  it  is  creating  them.
Mechanisms should be put in  place  to  provide  funding  and  expertise  to
rescue business and especially tourism.

There is no vaster unexploited area in South Africa  for  tourism  than  the
Eastern Cape. This is the  region,  besides  its  sheer  beauty  and  scenic
nature, where modern man first emerged in the world some 120 000 years ago.

We have already started an African  Renaissance  Community  Project  in  the
Ngqurha area. Nowhere  else  can  one  see  an  African  marketplace:  fresh
produce, arts and crafts and Khoisan rock artwork. We must  show  the  world
out there our fynbos, the traditional  African  healers,  organic  medicine,
trading ports and untouched nature.

I believe there is no quick solution to the crime situation. Let us  try  to
eliminate those things that contribute to  crime,  and  promote  the  better
implementation of laws. It must be more difficult for violent  criminals  to
obtain bail and we must pay attention  to  the  procedures  leading  to  the
granting of parole. The crime  of  using  a  stolen  or  unlicensed  firearm
during a crime should carry a heavy sentence. Only murder, violent rape  and
treason should be rated higher.

Social upliftment and job creation are essential. Hungry people will  steal,
even firearms, to  feed  themselves  and  their  families  if  there  is  no
prospect of a job. Many years ago Thomas Jefferson said, and I quote:


  When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When  the  people
  fear the government, there is tyranny.

The citizen who is law-abiding must be seen as a bastion against  crime  and
tyranny. We in the Eastern Cape do not fear the  Government.  We  are  loyal
and law-abiding citizens. We ask for the opportunity to make  a  success  in
our province. [Applause.]

Mr E RASOOL (Western Cape): Chairperson, Mr President,  I  want  to  add  my
voice of  congratulations  to  Premier  Molefe  for  being  elected  as  the
rotating Deputy Chair of this House. I think it is significant  that  he  is
put into that rotating position in this province at this time. We have  seen
rotating words, rotating loyalties, rotating parties, rotating premiers  and
rotating mayors in this province. We welcome him to the  rotating  province.
[Laughter.]

But in all of this rotation that we have seen in the Western Cape  there  is
probably the greatest need for this intervention by the President  and  this
kind of government by imbizo, because what this province and  its  citizens,
its people, need more than anything else is a restoration of  faith  in  the
politics of this country.

The President's initiative to go to the people,  to  listen,  to  provide  a
platform for problems to be aired, to celebrate  achievements  and  identify
weaknesses,  I  think,  is  the  most  important  process  that   we   need,
particularly in this province.
The Western Cape and Cape Town have suffered enormously  for  the  past  two
and half years, and I think Acting Premier Herandien  has  highlighted  what
surveys have been showing.

This province is potentially a great province,  given  its  natural  beauty,
its infrastructure that was concentrated in Cape Town at the expense of  the
Northern Cape and the Eastern Cape, higher  income  levels,  attraction  for
investors and tourists, levels of  urbanisation  which  have  given  greater
access to services, and its diversity of people, cultures and languages.  It
should be a province where people are happy, where  people  are  working  in
harmony with each other, where  there  is  the  greatest  onslaught  against
poverty, disease, homelessness and all other kinds of things.

It is a province where there should be the biggest sharing of  the  economic
benefits that accrue in this province, and yet the reality is that it  is  a
province in which there is the greatest alienation, as seen in  the  rampant
gangsterism, the phenomenon of urban terror  and  the  abuse  of  women  and
children that take place in this province.

It is a province where there is the greatest divide between rich  and  poor,
where there is the  greatest  polarisation  amongst  the  different  racial,
religious, language and other  groups.  In  short,  our  diversity  in  this
province has been a  cause  of  our  weakness  and  division,  and  has  not
resulted in our strength and unity.

The past two and a half years, characterised by that rotation  that  I  have
spoken about, have seen a deepening of our  weakness  and  division  in  the
body politic of the Western Cape. It has been added to by, if not  fed  off,
an oppositional  strategy  that  sought  to  find  a  formula  to  grab  the
opportunities of  this  province,  such  as  the  economic  growth,  without
confronting the challenges and the divisions amongst its people.

They tried to showcase its natural beauty and  its  infrastructure,  but  at
the same time to mask the pain of its people. They tried to pit the  Western
Cape  against  the  rest  of  our  country   and   our   continent   without
understanding that if the world is a global village, then the  Western  Cape
cannot stand separate. In  short,  it  was  an  oppositional  strategy  that
thought that these contradictions could be masked  by  or  resolved  through
maintaining a sharp focus on the negative  issues  which  result  from  that
strategy. The fear of the other was meant to keep our  province  together  -
the fear of blacks, the fear of other religions  and  languages  -  invoking
the most stereotyped image of our continent to try to hold people together.

Thankfully  and  true  to  form,  history  has  systematically   set   about
unravelling  each  and  every  contradiction   as   we   sit   here   today.
Unfortunately, it is the people, the electorate, the  voters,  the  citizens
who have borne the brunt  of  indignity,  particularly  over  the  last  few
months, a loss of faith in  the  political  process  across  this  province,
diminishing trust in Government's ability to care, a greater  apathy  and  a
growing despair about whether a better  life  is  indeed  possible  in  this
province.
This idea that the President has  come  to  report  on  to  us  today,  this
practice that he has been leading for the last two years of the imbizos,  of
contact with the people, is probably the greatest example that  we  need  as
we seek to define an agenda of co-operation on the great common ground  that
exists among all of us in this province, that transcends the  past.  But  we
must be conscious in understanding what this concept and  this  practice  of
imbizo is. We need to restore dignity, faith,  trust  and  optimism  amongst
the people of this province.

As Cape Town and the Western Cape emerged from  this  tragic  experiment  of
opposition gone wrong, the people in this province need  to  see  Government
and political parties at work, criticising and differing where we  need  to,
debating how best to go forward, not whether to  go  forward,  but  unafraid
and unashamed to occupy that massive common ground  that  this  country  and
our province offers to everyone who loves it. That is what we need to  grasp
as we go back to our people to restore their faith in what we are about.

The people of Cape Town and the Western Cape can  only  have  their  dignity
restored, their faith in politics renewed, their  trust  in  Government  re-
established, their despair reversed, if  we  follow  the  example  that  the
President reported on here today, of going to  the  people  and  doing  what
they need of us, what they want from us and what they demand  of  us;  doing
that and not doing what is convenient to political  parties,  to  movements,
to alliances and to individual politicians.

We need to say that that  great  common  ground,  that  glue  must  hold  us
together as the ANC and the New NP in this province to seek ways of  turning
around that lack of faith that  ordinary  citizens  have  developed  in  the
political process. The  glue  that  holds  us  together  is  an  orientation
towards the poor, to find a balance between the interests of  the  rich  and
the needs of the poor, to find  a  way  in  which  our  people  in  all  the
diversity, whether it is racial, linguistic or religious, can find a  common
ground, and they can call this Western Cape and this city  their  own.  That
is what we need.

The President has come here today to show us that  through  the  process  of
the imbizos we should go to the people, listening to  them  and  doing  what
they want of us and not what we define. This is what we should do.  I  think
therein lies the restoration of faith in the political process. It  is  that
faith which has systematically been battered over two and a  half  years  in
this province. I believe we can restore it. I  believe  that  the  President
has shown us how to do it. I believe that this is  the  emerging  world.  If
all of us, particularly those who have today defined themselves in  the  New
NP and the ANC, find ourselves and find each other, I believe that  we  will
turn the province around. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE NORTHERN PROVINCE (Adv N A  Ramatlhodi):  Modula  setulo,
le batlat[s]i ba gago ba ba bedi, moPresidente wa rena le ba Mphato,  ke  re
thobela, re a lot[s]ha. [Chairperson and his two assistants,  our  President
and colleagues, I greet you.]

In 1955 the Congress of the People  adopted  the  Freedom  Charter  and  the
opening line of it was:


  South Africa belongs to all those who live in it, black and white.

Forty-six years later, we believe it is our curse and our  fortune  to  make
sure that indeed South Africa does belong to  all  those  who  live  in  it,
black and white. We, therefore, stand ready, and  without  much  choice,  to
embrace our fellow compatriots in the quest to build  a  better  future  for
all. We welcome all those who, in spite of  massive  difficulties  in  doing
so, have had the courage to take a giant leap forward.

They will find us ready, willing and able to  work  together  for  a  common
future. We are doing it  not  as  a  matter  of  political  expediency,  but
because we believe that South Africa belongs to all those who  live  in  it.
Many have perished under conditions of exile, in jails, while being part  of
the underground movement, and we have seen some with fists  up,  dying,  and
still saying that South Africa belongs to all those who live in it.

The other ideal that was enshrined in  the  Freedom  Charter  was  that  the
people shall govern. So, when we talk  of  a  people-driven  society  and  a
participatory democracy, we  are  once  again  actualising  the  ideals  and
dreams of our forebears in saying the people shall govern. In  recent  days,
our President announced the  ground-breaking  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural
Development Programme  which  heralded  the  acceleration  of  an  ambitious
programme aimed at speeding up the delivery of a better life  for  all.  The
essential feature of this programme is that it does not look at  the  masses
or communities as powerless recipients of handouts from  Government  donors,
agencies and welfare organisations, but is rather designed  to  ensure  that
people take charge as joint architects and co-builders of their own  future.
Without trying to downplay the  many  developmental  challenges  that  still
confront us, it is equally true that every day, with  each  little  victory,
we are making progress. We see this in the opening of the new water taps  in
the rural villages, and the building of new clinics and new classrooms.

When the hon the President was in  our  province  with  this  new  phase  of
imbizos, one could see in the faces of those rural people, as they  gathered
in the Pietersburg stadium, that they had come to say  that  indeed  we  are
succeeding and making progress. We have also heard their cries  of  anguish,
pain and poverty and, in some instances, even  cries  of  powerlessness,  as
well as the questions they ask. Sometimes they are ready to  swear  to  what
they basically say to us. For instance, there was a case at  Mafefe  village
where we had an imbizo as the provincial executive council. We  happened  to
have bottled water with us. One of the people said we could  not  drink  the
water from the bottle, but had to drink the same water they did. That  again
thus indicates  the  difficulties  on  the  road  we  must  still  negotiate
together with our people.

We are part of the multipurpose communication centres that we  are  creating
in our country today. In some of the provinces  we  have  one-stop  centres.
Sometimes we are guided by the people themselves, like in Kgauthwane in  the
Northern Province, where, in the desert of poverty and  nothingness,  people
built bridges of hope, and  the  Government  joined  them.  The  example  of
direct interaction  between  Government  and  citizens  is  one  that  would
accelerate change in our country in an unprecedented manner. We, like  other
colleagues in other provinces, do attend  imbizos  fortnightly  to  exchange
ideas, views, to have a dialogue, to listen and to hear,  and  sometimes  to
rectify when the means are available.

Two districts in the Northern Province were identified as nodal  points  for
the implementation of the first phase of  the  ISRDs,  namely,  the  Eastern
district of Sekhukhune, which is also a cross-boundary with  Mpumalanga  and
Bushbuckridge. We launched the programmes in June this year as part  of  our
broader growth and development strategy and, in launching this, we held  two
regional summits in each of the six districts in our  province.  So,  as  we
emphasise our nodal points, we spread our wings  across  the  province  into
all six districts. These summits  brought  together  all  three  spheres  of
government, as well as parastatals, the business sector and  community-based
organisations. They provided us with a unique opportunity  to  look  at  our
districts with fresh  perspectives,  to  recognise  our  potential  and  our
challenges, and to plan together as communal owners of the  future  that  we
are busy constructing.

We are pleased to report that this exercise has been a  significant  success
and that we are  already  reaping  some  of  the  benefits.  All  those  who
participated in this summit were of  one  mind  in  saying  we  need  a  co-
ordinated approach, integrated plans and coherent strategies, and that  each
would have a role  to  play.  We  have  already  held  two  very  successful
provincial growth and development summits which were  attended  by  national
departments, parastatals,  the  business  sectors,  civic  society  and  the
churches. This has been the foundation on which we have  gone  out  to  roll
out the plan into the six districts.

Having planned  together  and  having  produced  a  growth  and  development
strategy  we  went  further  to  create  an  organ  called  the  development
oversight committee, a body comprising representatives from Government,  the
private sector and civil society. Through this  committee,  stakeholders  do
make direct inputs on economic and social priorities and monitor  Government
activities in a comprehensive way at a strategic level.

We think that the future of our people cannot wait and that we  must  enable
them to create it themselves. It is with this in mind  that,  following  the
national development plans of the country,  we  engaged  our  colleagues  in
Mozambique in the  Gaza  province,  and  also  in  the  three  provinces  of
Matebeleng South, Matebeleng North and Masvingo, so  that  the  peace  pacts
that we are building today become part and parcel of our own approach  to  a
people-driven and sustainable society.

We are greatly encouraged by the great Limpopo  peace  pact  that  has  just
recently been inaugurated, and we believe that it will give much impetus  to
our efforts to confront  the  high  levels  of  unemployment  in  the  three
countries that are involved and in our province specifically.

We are currently mopping up in terms of the  devastation  that  was  visited
upon us by the floods of a few years ago. This  affords  us  an  opportunity
now to begin to shift resources not only to recover infrastructure,  but  to
build new infrastructure.

I wish to take this opportunity, before I resume my  seat,  to  congratulate
the Acting Premier of the Western Cape, albeit that he  will  be  in  office
for a short while. [Applause.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, it gives me great pleasure  to  be  given  this
opportunity to respond to the hon the President's address.

The Northern Province comprises 5,3 million people,  59%  of  whom  live  in
poverty, and 90% of these people live in the rural areas.  Our  province  is
plagued by problems which are, inter alia,  superstition,  anomalous  sexual
practices, a high rate of unemployment, and the  struggle  to  recover  from
the flood disaster which wiped out almost all  the  infrastrucuture  network
during 1998-99.

We have cases of incest and bestiality, and  murders  of  the  aged  on  the
grounds of witchcraft are part  of  the  day-to-day  problems  the  province
grapples to contain. It  is  against  this  background  that  all  political
parties in the Northern Province will have to seriously consider and  put  a
high premium on the unity of purpose.

It serves no purpose for a housewife  to  damage  her  spouse's  vehicle  on
account of anger, because by doing so she  risks  her  absence  for  several
months from the hair salon and grocery shops. This is  also  the  case  with
those political parties which take great delight in criticising  those  that
are committed to the betterment of people's lives.

Problems that befell our province have  affected  all  the  people,  cutting
across party-political lines. It is  for  this  reason  that  the  unity-of-
purpose approach  is  of  the  utmost  importance.  Constituency  programmes
should not be utilised for pursuing party-political  interests,  but  rather
public representatives should get  time  to  interact  with  community-based
organisations, such as commodity groups, farmers'  unions,  women's  forums,
you name it, for the purpose of the interchange of information.

The hon the President will recall that during the recent  joint  sitting  an
hon member from the National Assembly  criticised  our  country  for  having
deployed our troops to Burundi. His response was that South Africa had  done
so because of its commitment to the maintenance of peace within SADC  states
and on the African continent  as  a  whole.  This  response  demonstrated  a
classic element of ubuntu. The Zulu adage goes as follows: Inxeba  le  ndoda
alihlekwa. [You do not make a joke about another person's misery.]

I am giving this observation in view of the refugee problem  around  Messina
in my area, the Northern Province. Close  to  a  thousand  illegal  refugees
from Zimbabwe have secured jobs on the farms in that area.  It  was  not  of
their own making that they found themselves there.  Hunger  pushed  them  to
where they are today. Yes, this is definitely a problem  that  needs  to  be
resolved. While we allow the law of our country  to  take  its  course,  the
doctrine of ubuntu should, however, prevail.

May I commend the hon the President for the wise words he uttered in the  UN
General Assembly recently on matters related  to  terrorism,  which  are  as
follows:


  ... we must act together to determine the issues  that  drive  people  to
  resort to force and agree on what we should do to eliminate these. At the
  same time, we must make the point patently clear that such  determination
  does not in any way constitute an attempt to justify terrorism.  Together
  we must take the firm position that no circumstances whatsoever can  ever
  justify resorts to terrorism.

I would like to say to the President that he must never think that the  good
work that he does outside passes unnoticed by some of us.
In conclusion, I would  like  to  leave  these  words  with  the  President:
Sterkte vorentoe, mnr die President.  [All  the  best  for  the  future,  Mr
President.] [Applause.]

The PREMIER  OF  THE  NORTHERN  CAPE  (Mr  E  M  Dipico):  Chairperson,  hon
President and hon members, we meet for this important debate, the review  of
2001, towards the end of the year and the beginning of the festive season.

During this period of the year, people from all  walks  of  life  will  take
time off to be with their loved ones, but our message today is  very  simple
and straightforward because it is during this time of year that we  need  to
reaffirm the important message of preserving the lives of our people, so  we
say ``Arrive alive. Do not drink and drive.''

The debate of the review of 2001 comes at a time when  we  in  the  Northern
Cape  province  have  met  with  ordinary  people  throughout   the   imbizo
activities, which were held throughout the province this week.  We  deployed
all our MECs and MPLs throughout the province to listen, get  direction  and
to respond to the needs of our people.

We also ensured that councillors and the  national  departments  which  have
offices in  the  province  participated.  This  strengthens  our  continuous
programme, ``cabinet meets the people'', a very persistent  programme.  This
year we dedicated the whole programme to the rural areas. Every second  week
on a Wednesday we take the whole cabinet and HODs to  the  far-flung  areas.
Last month we went to Loeriesfontein and Sanddrift, and next  week  we  will
be visiting Longlands.

Two years ago we listened to the people of Longlands and  launched  projects
for housing, sanitation, water and electricity in that rural  area.  Now  we
are going back to take stock of how far these projects have  developed,  how
many people have been employed and how they have impacted on  the  lives  of
the people. We  will  further  engage  in  talks  with  our  people  to  get
direction from them on how to strengthen them in order to make  their  lives
much better.
The elections of 2001 strengthened us. We insist that our  councillors  take
their cue from cabinet and be led by mayors to conduct ``council  meets  the
people'' meetings. They should go to the rural areas and wards on  a  weekly
basis as a collective to listen and respond to the  pressing  needs  of  our
people.

When we go to these areas with ``cabinet meets the people'',  we  take  them
along. Sometimes  some  of  them  are  embarrassed,  because  they  are  not
involved in ``council meets the people'', and  the  people  expose  them  by
telling us that the last time they saw them  was  when  they  campaigned  in
those areas. We then take a strong  stand  against  them  in  front  of  the
people. We tell them that we will not  allow  such  things  to  happen,  and
inform the people about how to act against leaders who  do  not  respond  to
their needs.

We have also embarked on a very important and innovative project  for  MPLs.
They, too, collectively go around the province  on  oversight  visits.  This
project is led by the speaker and her team. They have  to  ensure  that  the
reports received by the legislative committees  are  a  true  reflection  of
what is taking place. They have to go and  find  out  if  those  things  are
really  happening,  because  they  get  all  the   reports   on   education,
infrastructure and so forth. They go to the specific areas  and  also  write
reports which they present to the  legislature  for  debate.  These  reports
expose MECs and other individuals if they are not consistent. It  works  for
us, because it keeps all of us on our toes and encourages us  never  to  lie
and bring false reports to the legislature. It is indeed  a  programme  that
works well.

We have rolled out a number of one-stop centres in rural areas, and  for  us
this has been a continuous project. Being aware of limited resources, we  do
not go crying to the national Government. We  went  out  and  roped  in  the
private sector. Only last week the former president visited us  with  people
from the private sector to launch a new R7 million one-stop centre.

These are people who own vast sums of money in the province. They make  wine
which makes our people drunk. Our people ``suip'' [druk] too  much,  and  we
are saying that they must plough back  into  the  community.  We  asked  one
company, Gilbey's, to plough back into the community.  We  asked  them  what
they were doing to promote the moral regeneration of our  people  and  their
moral fibre, and to build unity in these families since they have  destroyed
families with their cheap wines. There are  so  many  grapes  all  over  the
place and in every corner, and our people make a lot  of  concoctions.  With
only bread and water people make concoctions. [Laughter.] That  is  why  the
problem is so serious in our province. This is no  joke;  it  is  a  serious
problem. We told them that they should play a role.

We have launched another project in Colesberg. The people of this town  have
to travel 240km to De Aar to get a death certificate,  because  they  cannot
bury their dead before they have that certificate. They cannot register  the
births of their children, and for that they  have  to  go  to  De  Aar.  The
poorest of the poor who cannot even pay for a coffin  have  to  travel  that
distance in order to  get  assistance.  They  also  have  to  go  there  for
driver's licences and marriage certificates, and that is  why  they  do  not
get married. Ngoomasihlalisane [These are people who cohabit]. [Laughter.]

It is very difficult. They have to spend money to go and collect a  marriage
certificate. The Department of Labour, where people  go  to  find  jobs,  is
also in De Aar.

We now have a very good one-stop service centre which services the needs  of
the people. People no longer have to travel to De Aar because they  can  get
all  the  services  from  this  one  multipurpose  centre,   including   the
Department of Labour. We have also put up a  multipurpose  training  centre,
including telecentres, in order to train the local rural people of  Noupoort
and Norvalspont in the use of computers, e-mail and the  Internet.  That  is
the change that we want to see, and we want our  people  to  appreciate  the
difference all this is making in their lives.

While we were in Colesberg, we used this opportunity to  persuade  a  former
prisoner to  go  and  visit  the  prisoners.  This  programme  is  going  on
throughout the province. We go and see the inmates, sit with them and  talk.
We try to find out why they keep getting in and out of  prison.  We  say  to
them, ``We were wearing green like you, and we were in the  same  cells  you
are in now. Mandela is out, there he is, and he is  a  better  person.  What
are you doing?''

This has an impact on young people. For the very young people who have  lost
hope, this programme is starting to change their thinking. I hope all of  us
will go out there, because these are our children, and  we  need  to  change
their thinking. [Interjections.]

At these events during which we talk to  the  people,  particularly  at  the
imbizos, ordinary people have reaffirmed their belief  in  the  broad  goals
and objectives we as Government are undertaking. They share our vision of  a
nonracial,  nonsexist,  prosperous  and  democratic   South   Africa.   This
confidence is born out of the fact that, since the dawn  of  democracy,  our
country and province have been striving to do everything in their  power  to
realise the goals of a better life for all.

Every year has seen our Government come closer and closer to this goal.  The
challenges are very daunting, but we have the determination  and  commitment
to bring about fundamental change in this part of our country.

This year, 2001, the year of the African century, is also marked by an  even
bigger challenge - to realise the  interconnectedness  of  our  country  and
continent. We continue, in earnest, to improve the quality of  life  of  the
most disadvantaged people of our province, through, among others, the  nodal
integrated rural development strategy the President launched.  Our  province
and the North West province have achieved real progress in this regard.

We have also completed a basket of projects which will inform the  Galeshewe
urban development programme for urban  renewal,  infrastructure  development
and job creation opportunities for the unemployed. We are  generally  upbeat
about the recent announcements made  by  the  Minister  of  Finance,  Trevor
Manuel, in his Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement.  Whereas  provinces  had
over the past years had serious difficulties in  managing  public  finances,
over time we have developed and continue to improve  on  aspects  of  public
finance management. The completion of the  appointment  of  chief  financial
officers in our province will further stabilise this initiative  and  enable
us to put public resources where they are most required and needed.

We are resolutely committed to dealing poverty and unemployment  a  decisive
blow. We have laid the foundation for optimising this endeavour.

The hideous crimes we see occurring in some parts of our province  have,  in
the main, their source of origin and basis in alcohol abuse. This is one  of
the biggest problems we have, and I want us to rise  here  as  a  collective
against that problem. One of the grave consequences of  the  ``dop''  system
is starting to show its ruthless effect on our people. Families  are  broken
and they have disintegrated.

The Northern Cape and the Western Cape are special cases.  We  need  a  very
integrated approach to deal with them. It cannot be by welfare or  health  -
we would be missing the point. We need a fully integrated new initiative  to
bring our people together and see how best we can deal  with  this  problem.
We even need to bring the private sector on board  throughout  our  province
and in the Western  Cape,  because  that  is  where  the  wine  industry  is
located. They should plough back into the community to ensure  that  we  can
deal with the problem.

Even in cases where people are healthy and they can work, we find that  they
are not prepared to work, because they can get the cheapest wine. They  have
all sorts of names for them,  such  as  Alexandra,  and  when  one  goes  to
Mdantsane, they have a different name, and in Kimberley there  is  the  same
thing. But we have seen the results in Upington.  It  is  a  very  difficult
problem, and we need to rise and embark on a campaign which  we  can  unfold
together as a country and make a difference.

At this point we want to join many ordinary  people  and  raise  our  voices
higher in the battle against child abuse and rape. It is  very  serious  and
it is the most hideous crime ever committed against a  fellow  human  being.
We have confidence in the judiciary, and those found to be responsible  will
be appropriately dealt with.

One of the points  which  has  been  highlighted  in  this  regard  is  that
whenever a victim of rape has to identify the  culprit,  she  has  to  stand
there and look the person in the eye, and  go  and  touch  the  person.  One
finds that most of the time our women and our young  ladies  cannot  do  it,
because these are very dangerous people. If such a person were  to  look  at
me I would also feel threatened. I could not touch a person tattooed  up  to
his eyes. It would be very difficult. I think a new  system  of  identifying
these people and bringing them to book will assist us.

In conclusion, I want to mention two very important examples of  improvement
of services. One example is in the rural areas where we  have  been  working
in partnership with the Red Cross. We go out to  a  different  region  every
month and give health services to our people. We take  eye  specialists  and
other specialists who treat all sorts of diseases to assist those people  in
the rural areas. The Red Cross has been removing cataracts because  that  is
a big problem in older people.

The other day in Mier in the Kalahari, next to the border of  Botswana,  the
doctors removed cataracts from the eyes of a number of  older  people.  They
did one operation on an Ouma [Grandma] Bettie. After  completing  the  whole
operation, I went close to the old lady to see  whether  her  operation  had
been a success. When they took all  the  dressings  from  ouma's  eyes,  she
could see a person in front of her, and she could see light.  She  stood  up
and she said: Ek kan dit nie glo nie! Oupa,  is  dit  jy?  Oupa,  jy  is  so
oulik! Ek het  gedink  jy  is  oud!  [Gelag.]  [I  can't  believe  it!  Oupa
(grandfather), is it you? Oupa, you are so cute! I  thought  you  were  old!
[Laughter.]]

She thought I was her husband. She last saw ``me'' 15  years  ago  and,  now
here ``I'' am looking so handsome. I felt very good when  the  ouma  said  I
looked nice. Nobody had told me that before. Ouma jumped up and down like  a
small girl. She said that it was the work of God. She  could  not  see,  and
God had made her see. She thought  that  we  were  the  disciples  of  Jesus
Christ. That is how ordinary people saw the difference. That is  what  makes
us move forward and want to do these things all the time.

Another project we have embarked on is to improve  the  Kimberley  Hospital.
We took the Minister there the other day when we launched  it.  The  private
sector clinics are closing down in Kimberley because of a better service  at
the provincial hospital. People with  medical  aid  are  now  going  to  the
hospital, because of a better quality service. All MECs and  the  premier  -
all of us - get our service from the hospital. Even my  child  was  born  in
that hospital. [Laughter.] [Applause.] That is public  service,  and  it  is
beautiful. If all of us could provide that type of service, we  would  bring
back the dignity of our people.

Lastly, on behalf of all of us I would like to thank the President  for  the
work he has done in keeping us very committed to our people and  keeping  us
in touch with ordinary people, making  sure  that  we  always  go  back  and
respond to their needs and making sure that we  account  to  them.  That  is
what will really make  South  Africa  work.  We  thank  him  very  much.  He
constantly makes us account through the PCC and through these meetings.

I would like to say to Premier Molefe that as  he  takes  over  as  rotating
Deputy Chairperson, we would like to see him  presiding.  We  hope  that  he
will change the NCOP for the better. But if he lacks experience, I  am  here
to assist him, because I was indeed in that position before.

I also want to thank my neighbour, Acting Premier Herandien: Ek wil vir  hom
sê ons gaan 'n lang pad loop. [I want to say to him that  we  are  going  to
walk a long way.]

If he needs any assistance, I am just across the road. He  should  call  me,
and I will assist him. [Applause.]

Ms C S BOTHA: Chairperson, hon  President,  premiers,  if  ever  this  House
should pass a law on cloning people,  my  first  proposal  for  a  candidate
would be the premier of the Northern Cape. [Laughter.]

I hope  all  present  find  our  subtly  developing  political  language  as
exciting in sound and image as I do. It is ``lekgotla, bosberaad,  Tirisano,
Batho Pele,  haak,  Vrystaat  and  imbizo.''  These  unfamiliar  sounds  are
gathering a deep and comforting resonance. It is happening in this  Council,
and it is happening outside. We are already a  world  in  one  country,  and
now, frequently, speaking with one voice, even if it is in many languages.

While poverty everywhere  remains  palpable,  and  disparities  glaring  and
glowing, nevertheless, the Government spent time this  week  on  the  Imbizo
Focus Week, during which it went to places, at  least  in  the  Free  State,
such as the Xhariep Distict Council, Zamdela near  Sasolburg,  Kroonstad  or
Moqhaka municipality where a previous member of this Council is  now  mayor,
and met with Mr Ndema, the ever-obliging representative of  the  Free  State
home affairs  department,  or  spent  time  at  the  place  of  much  water,
Metsimaholo,  or  spoke  in  Jacobsdal  or  visited  community  projects  in
Villiers daar in die Noord-Oos  Vrystaat  [in  the  Northeast  Free  State].
Those visits will reveal reality and not political mirage, as all  who  have
gone this route have humbly experienced.

I believe the President himself will be visiting Qwaqwa, and I know  he  has
already acted against the councillors of the former  Phuthaditjhaba  council
in Qwaqwa who voted themselves a cosy  three  quarters  of  a  million  rand
bonus just before  the  1999  election.  The  magnitude  of  such  mercenary
behaviour becomes even more appalling when viewed against  the  backdrop  of
that particular community, which is suffering an unemployment rate of  about
88%, and of whom 75% are purportedly chronically hungry.

I hope the President's actions against these councillors will challenge  all
who are in positions of power that they should be  focusing  on  service  to
the community, and not to themselves, and that his visit will guide them  to
confront the major unresolved problems in our society.

But even if there are enough problems in the Free State alone to occupy  him
full time - and the premier should please listen - would he please not  give
a special thought to Adeline Meje Primary School in Viljoenskroon, which  he
will not be visiting, but which has  1  000  hard-working,  well-disciplined
learners and dedicated staff and who are asking nothing more than  a  single
computer with which to do their administrative work? I beg him.

The people of this country will travel with the President  on  the  highways
and the byways to which his imbizos take him. But when  he  stops  a  moment
along a little stream to  reflect  on  other  things,  such  as  the  recent
developments between the ANC and another party with whom we in the  DP  have
recently had  a  fleeting  acquaintance,  he  should  please  remember  this
friendly piece of advice: Do not believe that every frog you kiss will  turn
into a prince! [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Perhaps  it  is
fitting now to ask the reverend to address this House.

Father S MKHATSHWA (Salga): Chairperson, hon President and  hon  members,  I
thank the Council for the platform that has been accorded to us  as  the  SA
Local Government Association, Salga, to share some of  our  views  with  the
House. The President and some of the hon members have touched upon  some  of
the pertinent  issues  regarding  local  government.  I  want  to  tell  the
President that we support the imbizo initiative  most  enthusiastically.  In
fact, some of the local authorities  have  ensured  that  the  other  social
sectors that do not normally attend community meetings  also  are  not  left
out of  this  wonderful  process.  The  hon  the  President's  intellectual,
business, church and religious organisations, as well as youth  and  women's
organisations, are also in  the  process  of  interacting  with  many  local
authorities.

Now, as the House knows, this is the first time I address this House  in  my
capacity as the chairperson of Salga, and I would  like  to  thank  the  hon
Deputy Chairperson for the wonderful things and words  of  encouragement  he
said regarding Salga. I feel truly honoured  and  would  like  to  use  this
opportunity to say hello and take the chance to introduce our  understanding
of some of the local government issues.

I would like to focus on an aspect  which  has  a  bearing  on  the  overall
situation of local government vis-à-vis our communities. I  speak  of  local
economic development, the impact of which, from a job creation  perspective,
is felt in the servicing of water, lights and refuse collection accounts  by
our  residents  and  businesses,  and  therefore   affects   the   long-term
sustainability of our towns, villages and cities.

We address the House today as local governments which have responded to  the
obligation of providing water, electricity and refuse  removal  services  to
our people. We have turned Government's promise of a basic  amount  of  free
water and electricity into reality where  infrastructure  exists.  Where  no
infrastructure is currently in place,  and  there  are  still  such  places,
unfortunately, we are proceeding apace with plans to bring this into  being.
What I am saying is that we have met our  obligations  with  regard  to  our
mandate of providing services to all our communities  to  the  best  of  our
ability.

One of the fundamental changes brought about by  the  new  local  government
dispensation has been the enhancement of local government from being a  mere
provider of water, electricity and refuse removal  services  into  a  sphere
truly complementary to the national and provincial  spheres  of  government.
This is particularly the case with regard to economic development.
We have come to realise that economic development begins at  the  microlevel
of local government, and that decisions  with  regard  to  such  matters  as
business and land allocations, for example, have  to  be  made  against  the
background  of  the  number  of  jobs  to  be  created  and  what  new  real
investments are involved.

Reinforcing local government in this way  to  include  economic  development
necessarily   has   material   implications   for   municipalities.    These
implications are both human and financial. On the human  front,  it  is  the
question of human resource capacity that  arises,  while  on  the  financial
front the challenge is mainly to ensure that  local  infrastructure  becomes
attractive to potential investors, be they domestic or foreign.  In  looking
for investment destinations, as we know, business looks for much  more  than
just land or a building. It is thus critical that municipalities  invest  in
their own development as much as they ask for business to invest in them.

A particular challenge in this  regard  is  a  suite  of  management  skills
straddling  general   management,   human   resource   management,   project
management and, most importantly, financial management. This  is  a  complex
set  of  skills  whose  aggregate  is  a  prerequisite  for  the  successful
operation of modern  metros.  They  are  mandatory  for  the  management  of
budgets of billions, and infrastructure upon which  regional  economies  are
becoming increasingly dependent.  They  are  compulsory  in  an  environment
where the metros  collectively  account  for  80%  of  the  country's  gross
domestic product.

I emphasise the  point  less  to  hype  the  importance  of  the  new  local
government system and  more  to  highlight  the  high-level  corporate-style
skills that we now require to run our megacities.  I  stress  the  point  in
order to underline the financial challenges we have to overcome as  part  of
our redirection of municipalities. The skills I have catalogued  are  priced
at a premium, especially in an environment where,  traditionally,  education
has been more humanities based than commercially inclined. We begin our  new
system as a country, therefore, with an obligation to  invest  more  in  the
short to medium term than we might gain in the long term and that  we  might
gain in our effort to provide these services. In the  longer  term,  though,
our investment will result in  municipalities  about  which  investors  feel
confident, and  therefore  in  jobs  and  our  strategic  objective  of  the
reduction of poverty.

Also critical is investment in the infrastructure  of  our  towns,  villages
and cities. Without necessarily gentrifying our  cities,  in  the  sense  of
right-wing tendencies, we  have  to  rehabilitate  moribund  infrastructure,
reconstruct buildings that have gone to rack and ruin, end  shantytowns  and
develop  commercially  attractive  land.   These,   too,   are   financially
demanding, both in terms  of  the  human  resource  expertise  necessary  to
manage them as well as in the money needed to secure the material  resources
to realise them.

We begin our existence in our new form without enough resources to meet  the
development obligations I have referred  to.  Some  district  councils,  for
example, are on the verge of dysfunctionality, even though  they  are  doing
their best to continue providing  services.  We  are  hamstrung  by  limited
human and financial capacity. It is thus important that  we  alert  national
and provincial governments about the need for a careful  evaluation  of  our
situation so that we may better add value to the economic  development  that
we have been witness to in this country over the  past  six  years.  We  see
ourselves giving practical expression, at the intimate level on the  ground,
to national and provincial governments' continuous economic  empowerment  of
our communities. We believe that the success  or  failure  of  socioeconomic
reconstruction  initiatives,  such  as  the  African  Renaissance  and   the
Millennium Africa Recovery Programme, will ultimately be determined  by  the
extent to which people's daily lives, at local level, improve or worsen.

It is a task fraught  with  challenges  as  factors  such  as  globalisation
conspire to undermine those economies lacking the  fundamentals  to  compete
against the developed world. All the more reason, then, for us to do all  we
can to exploit our potential to contribute to the  economic  competitiveness
of our cities, provinces and therefore of South Africa as a whole.  In  this
regard, we have to explore  possibilities  of  tax  holidays  at  the  local
level, nominal fees for land for business  ventures  guaranteed  to  provide
meaningful and sustainable numbers of  job  opportunities,  labour-intensive
municipal projects and empowerment approaches to tender  allocations,  among
many  options.  We  have  to  partner  our  provinces   in   the   practical
implementation of provincial economic development  initiatives  and  in  the
creation of environments conducive to investment.

As  Salga  we  are  committed  to   co-ordinating   the   efforts   of   our
municipalities to build capacity, share  constructive  experiences,  exploit
synergies,  synchronise  common  and  mutually  beneficial  initiatives  and
provide a single platform  for  interaction  with  national  and  provincial
governments, the private sector, nongovernmental  organisations,  community-
based organisations, civil society and, above all, the NCOP.

We are committed to the principles of  developmental  local  government  and
the  practice  of  governance  with  integrity  and   financial   accounting
standards in line with Government's stated  objectives  and  legislation  in
this regard. We have set ourselves the task  of  managing  local  government
transformation in a  way  which  balances  access  and  equity  issues  with
professional performance and quality assurance and maintenance.

In our interaction with other tiers of Government we have already  seen  the
kind of concern and commitment that we expect in order for us to succeed.  A
co-operative and interactive style of government is very important. I  would
like to suggest that no Minister, premier, MEC or executive mayor should  be
regarded as a special guest or VIP whenever  they  visit  whatever  part  of
South Africa, for the simple reason that their visit  should  be  the  norm,
not an exception.

Salga is the mirror with which people  see  and  judge  the  performance  of
President Thabo Mbeki's Government. Salga rubs  shoulders  with  44  million
South Africans  who  applaud  or  criticise  Government  by  the  way  local
government serves the people from Monday to Monday, January to  January,  24
hours around the clock.

On 11 September the role of local government administration in the USA  ably
demonstrated its importance. Giulioni, the mayor, was the only visible  face
of the US government to deal with a very serious crisis. When there  are  no
schools, no clinics, no ambulances, no jobs, no houses, and where  there  is
crime, poverty, the disabled and rape of a nine-month old  babies  by  adult
criminals, people turn their attention to local  authorities.  There  is  no
use in telling them about provincial or  national  competencies,  hence  the
need for us to  work  together  in  the  way  in  which  the  President  has
emphasized. Of course, one  could  also  provide  them  with  the  telephone
number of Premier Stofile, but they would not be very impressed.  When  they
see us, they see the Government of the country. [Applause.]
Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, during  the  President's  imbizo  visit  to  the
Western Cape on 12 September, he opened the Phillipi  Training  College  for
municipal police in our province, the first of its  kind  in  South  Africa.
The President will be pleased to know that some  400  recruits  will  finish
their training on 13 December and will be ready for  deployment  during  the
holiday period in Cape Town.

We also valued his personal visit with the premier of our  province  to  the
flood-stricken areas, which was a time of trial for us, and the help we  got
at the time. We are grateful for that.

We have all embarked upon the ideal of building our country, our  provinces,
our nation and our continent. What role does politics play in  this  regard,
since we are  politicians?  At  present  many  people  in  our  country  are
confused - certainly in my province.

The young Jan Smuts - his greatness still in the future - once confessed  to
the then Cape Prime Minister John X Merriman, who sat in this House,  in  an
uncharacteristic mood  of  despair,  that  he  felt  like  dropping  out  of
politics altogether. He said, and I quote:


  Perhaps at the bottom I do not believe in politics at all as a means  for
  the attainment of the highest ends.

The older and wiser John X Merriman gently reproved him and replied:


  Surely ... politics is not the means. It is in itself  the  highest  end,
  but not the politics centering on the dreary  wrangles  of  the  ins  and
  outs, but politics aimed at making a small city great, and at raising the
  whole life and character of every class in the community. There can be no
  higher ambition nor any more worthy object.

That remains so today when we are acting at our best. So is the  President's
new Africa initiative - a great vision, if I may say so.  I  would  like  to
say something about the provincial dimension of that vision.

Seven of  our  provinces  have  African  neighbours.  Other  are  linked  by
airfields and ports, and they have a role to play. We have  already  seen  -
this is not something that is in the future - dramatic and far-reaching  co-
operation between Mpumalanga and Mozambique with the new  peace  parks;  the
Maputo Corridor and  the  international  award-winning,  multibillion  Mozal
development at Maputo, completed six  months  ahead  of  time  and  at  R100
million below budget. We can do it.

The new peace parks initiative, which that hon member  mentioned,  including
the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, is the greatest  step  taken,  perhaps
for a hundred years, in conservation and regional co-operation. It  involves
six national governments, five provincial  governments,  NGOs,  the  private
sector and the  international  community  and  the  benefits  will  be  far-
reaching for us all.

We need a new vision. The King James Version of the Book of  Proverbs  says:
Where there is no vision, the people perish. We need to elevate and  ennoble
our politics, and our provinces need to find ways and means of making  their
contribution to the process.

In one of the documents I read, the  President  speaks  of  a  new  kind  of
leadership required in Africa, and he is right. We need clear  vision,  hard
work, dogged perseverance, iron discipline, confidence, faith in  our  cause
and servant leadership. But we also need to be men of action. Thomas  Edison
defined genius as 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. We also need a  sense
of service. One thing I miss about the bad old days  -  not  everything  was
bad in the bad old days -  is  that  civil  servants  signed  their  letters
``your obedient servant''. We need to  cultivate  a  sense  of  service  and
servant leadership. We share the President's great vision. [Applause.]

Ms  J  L  KGOALI:  Chairperson,  His  Excellency  Comrade  President  Mbeki,
premiers, hon members, distinguished guests and colleagues, at times one  is
persuaded not to respond to some of the people who  normally  do  things  in
this House in the manner in which they do them. The  hon  Durr  should  know
that it is about time that we showed  respect  to  the  leadership  of  this
country. As a Christian, talking to the hon the President  with  one's  hand
in one's pocket is disgusting. [Interjections.] [Laughter.]

 Nevertheless, many reasons are put forward  to  explain  why  unemployment,
poverty and communicable diseases persist in our country. One does not  need
the wisdom of Solomon of old to figure out why. Not all the reasons have  to
do with the capabilities of our people; many have to  do  with  the  unequal
distribution  of  productive  assets  in  our  society  and  the  legacy  of
apartheid.

The poor have very few resources to muster. Indeed,  many  have  only  their
labour. Unfortunately, we have men and women in the  opposition  benches  in
this House who  have  since  the  last  general  elections  demonstrated  an
aversion to the work and efforts of our Government to rebuild and unite  our
beloved country.

We as the majority party in this august House of Parliament do not  need  to
be convinced  that  the  President's  vision  and  that  of  the  collective
leadership of Government remains, for South Africa and  all  its  people,  a
nation at work for a better life for all. It is indeed a noble vision.

Re  thoholetsa  Mookamedi  wa  rona.  Re  re  ke  mohale,  ke  moetapele  ya
bontshitseng lefatshe ka bophara boetapele ba hae. Re  a  mo  hlompha  ntata
rona. [We praise our President. We say that he  is  a  hero,  a  leader  who
showed the whole world his leadership skills. We respect him, our father.]

It is therefore paramount that we continue to scrutinise  the  policies  and
programmes that were put in place by Government, and  the  positive  results
yielded by them. It is indeed satisfying to know that these  programmes  and
results transcend every sphere of government and society.

As a sphere of government ideally and uniquely placed, the National  Council
of Provinces' role in oversight is to draw provincial and  local  experience
into the national debate when the effectiveness of these policies and  their
implementation are considered. I am, in fact, glad to announce that this  is
what is  happening  here  today  as  we  are  gathered  from  all  the  nine
provinces, including from local  government.  We  are,  at  the  same  time,
drawing provincial governments and local government together into  a  single
forum. The NCOP permits sharing of experience and ideas among provinces  and
the local government.

We are indeed fortunate to share with Comrade President in  the  celebration
of transformation and improvement in the living conditions  and  environment
of the masses of our country.

Two such programmes of major significance, which  have  been  identified  by
the hon the President, are  the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural  Development
Strategy and the integrated Urban Renewal Programme of which  the  objective
is to conduct a sustained programme against rural  and  urban  poverty,  and
underdevelopment. These programmes, as I  speak,  are  on  course  and  will
drastically reduce poverty in rural and urban areas.

The Urban Renewal Programme has been  started,  the  project  to  which  the
President allocated R1,3 billion.  The  President  launched  it  himself  in
Alexandra. Its first  draft  has  been  completed  and  is  based  upon  the
findings  of  a  comprehensive   environmental   strategy   assessment,   on
transportation and aerial photography.

A total of 10 precincts have been  identified  in  Alexandra.  Tenders  have
been placed for the appointment of the  first  three  precinct  managers  in
that area. A total of 7 064 informal structures have been relocated  out  of
the dangerous circumstances within the flood plain of the Jukskei River.  Of
these, 4 251 households have been removed to Diepsloot and 1 025  have  been
relocated to Braamfisherville.

In addition, 200 formal structures, which were  near  the  river  bank,  are
being removed and are currently being relocated in the Extension  8  housing
project. They are being removed because they were actually sinking into  the
river bank.

The Jukskei River itself has been extensively cleaned. Its banks  have  been
stabilised and consolidated, and grass planting  has  commenced.  Also,  the
construction of the Alexandra Police Station is proceeding well  and  should
be completed in the coming months.

In terms  of  economic  and  social  development,  Alexandra's  preferential
procurement framework has been activated. To date, over 10 000  persons  are
employed. Moreover, partnerships are being forged between the  projects  and
surrounding commercial, industrial and retail areas  to  stabilise  business
through the establishment of business improvement districts.

What is also  of  major  significance  is  the  launching  of  the  targeted
immunisation campaign, which focuses on young children as part of a  broader
health awareness programme. This is a sterling effort, indeed. In  addition,
rural development programmes have  been  launched  at  Mzinyathi,  KwaMashu,
Inanda  and  in  KwaZulu-Natal  in   line   with   Government's   Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Strategy.

One has heard on radio and seen on TV women from Mzinyathi  celebrating  the
projects that they have been given. Just to be provided with clean water  is
something  that  excites  our  people.  What  is  significant  is  that  the
community has been actively participating - the community of Mzinyathi -  in
the whole programme that has been put together and where one saw the  Deputy
President, together  with  the  Minister  of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry,
participating in what the hon  Durr  called  the  imbizos.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

The ACTING PREMIER OF KWAZULU-NATAL (Mr  N  J  Ngubane):  Madam  Chair,  hon
President and hon members, I think first and foremost let  me  take  my  cue
from those colleagues who  congratulated  the  hon  Premier  Molefe  on  his
appointment as the  Rotating  Chairperson  of  our  NCOP.  KwaZulu-Natal  is
saying: ``Congratulations, my brother.''

This debate offers an opportunity to take stock  of  governance  across  the
country and the role of provinces. Two questions arise,  which  are  linked,
but not the same.  Firstly:  What  have  the  provinces  done  to  implement
actions decided at national level? Secondly: What  have  provinces  done  to
promote governance through their own initiatives?

We need to determine  whether  this  debate  is  about  assessing  how  well
provinces have fulfilled national mandates and expectations, or  whether  it
is about assessing the overall functions of provinces.  It  is  fitting  for
our hon President to reflect on how  the  system  of  provincial  government
works. However, in the final analysis, each province  must  respond  to  and
account for its actions, for  its  delivery  and  for  its  achievements  on
behalf of the people it serves.

My province is particularly this  way  inclined,  because  we  believe  that
accountability  to  our  voters  is  the  most  important  element  of  good
governance. Our premier has begun an  extensive  programme  of  consultation
with the people of KwaZulu-Natal, not only to report on  what  the  province
has achieved,  but  also  to  hear  what  their  complaints  are  about  our
shortcomings as a province and to get the full measure of  their  needs  and
aspirations.

This programme has  run  under  the  name:  ``The  government  goes  to  the
people.'' This is a constant form of dialogue  between  our  government  and
the people we serve, which cuts across all functional lines. The outcome  of
this dialogue is the constant flow of information, which  will  increasingly
enable our province to fine-tune its policies and define  the  direction  of
its future course of action.

We place emphasis on this dialogue because we believe it to be the best  way
of promoting better governance. However, the flip side of this  approach  is
that our policies will be those which emerge from our response to the  needs
of our people, rather than those which we  feel  compelled  to  perform  and
implement in response to pressure from national departments and to meet  the
expectations of the national Government.

We are an elected government, tasked by the expectations of  our  electorate
and the Constitution to read and address the needs of the people  we  serve.
This function is essential, continuous, detailed and systematic.  It  cannot
be replaced by flying visits to our province by some national Ministers  who
may, from time to time, organise collective  meetings  on  specific  subject
matters.

This is not to detract from the value of these  meetings  which  have  taken
place during this year, but to highlight that their  function  can  only  be
that of supporting the  initiatives  that  provinces  intend  to  undertake,
rather than directing or dictating what provinces are to  do.  In  fact,  if
national Ministers were in a position to determine what needs to be done  by
virtue of a few days spent in each province, it would  mean  that  provinces
are incapable of fulfilling their role. It would be a vote of no  confidence
in provinces' capacity for understanding, acting and reacting as our  people
expect.

I also wish to  highlight  the  need  to  strengthen  intergovernmental  co-
ordination, not only on the vertical basis but on the  horizontal  basis  as
well. The vertical relationship between the national and  provincial  levels
of government should be strengthened by  asserting  the  equal  dignity  and
responsibility of its two partners. It cannot be a one-way  relationship  of
the national sphere of government directing provinces and seeking  to  guide
them.

To strengthen our system of government by enhancing the role  of  provinces,
we need to bring about a paradigm shift in which we finally accept  that  it
should be up to provinces to guide and direct the central Government in  all
matters of provincial competence.  If  they  were  really  performing  their
constitutional task, provinces would know and do better,  and  therefore  be
in a position to advise the central Government accordingly.  Admittedly,  we
are far from having reached that point, especially  because  of  a  lack  of
capacity in policy analysis  and  formulations  which  affect  most  of  our
provinces.

However, we need to  start  moving  in  that  direction,  and  the  national
Government should cast its relationship  with  provinces  in  the  mould  of
assistance, enabling us to do more and better by ourselves, not for our  own
sake but for the sake of the people we serve. By enabling us to do more  and
better by ourselves, in the  final  analysis  the  central  Government  will
better serve our common constituency.

In respect of the horizontal relationship amongst provinces, not enough  has
been done to promote this. There are not enough contacts between  provinces,
and sufficient co-ordination between each of their line functions. Such  co-
ordination should be promoted at the initiative  of  provinces  and  without
always resorting to the national Government. We cannot  blame  the  national
Government for these shortcomings, which  are  unfortunately  the  fault  of
provinces' own lack of initiative.

I hope that, in the  new  year,  new  provincial  initiatives  will  develop
through horizontal intergovernmental co-operation, and that  provinces  will
have greater exchanges so as to focus on how they can best  respond  to  the
identified  needs  of  their  people.  This   will   enable   provinces   to
differentiate their actions, which is necessary if we are to  be  responsive
to what people want, and obviously that cannot be  done  through  a  uniform
national solution, unless one thinks that  all  our  people  want  the  same
things, which would make it unnecessary to  consult  them  on  a  nationwide
basis.

For instance, our province is very concerned about the issue of  traditional
leadership,  which  still  remains  unsolved,   and   is   undermining   the
effectiveness of governance and our developmental efforts  at  local  level.
Our powers in this respect are limited, but we know that finding a  solution
can no longer wait. We understand that perhaps it is much  less  urgent  for
other provinces to deal with this issue, as  it  may  be  less  relevant  in
their context.

Other  provinces  may  also  be  less  interested  in  dealing  with   rural
development, as they are more urbanised. In our province, rural  development
and upliftment is an imperative from which we may not escape.  Indeed,  this
is a vocational commitment which our Government has  made.  It  reflects  on
who we are and what we have promised our electorate. It is  that  for  which
we feel accountable to our people, the great majority  in  rural  areas  who
are in a situation of underdevelopment.

Izimbizo were  quite  successful  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  with  our  support  as
traditional leaders. We recognise that not enough has been done in the  past
to unleash the developmental potential in the rural areas. We have  launched
many programmes, and we will  launch  many  more.  Our  poverty  alleviation
programmes are making some inroads, but more needs to be done.  We  need  to
be able to do more and deal with  issues  such  as  traditional  leadership,
which, if unresolved in  spite  of  many  promises  made,  will  spell  some
disaster for the whole of our country.

I also need to express concerns regarding the draft  legislation  tabled  in
the Portfolio Committee on Justice to amend Schedule 2 of  the  Constitution
in order to scrap the antidefection clause. This will have an impact on  the
composition  of  provincial  legislatures.  This   major   change   in   our
constitutional  system  came  as  a  bolt  from  the  blue,  without   prior
consultations and negotiations, especially with provinces.

One sphere of government  is  changing  the  rules  of  operation  of  other
spheres without even consulting them. This seems to be done  to  accommodate
specific political needs arising at this specific time between two  specific
political parties pursuing a  specific  political  agenda  in  one  specific
province. We wonder whether  constitutionalism  and  the  rule  of  law  are
really promoted by amending the Constitution merely to pursue such  specific
political expediency.

From a principled viewpoint,  one  must  decide  whether  the  antidefection
clause is good, in which case it should stay, no matter how inconvenient  or
expedient it may be for some of the players, or whether it is bad, in  which
case it should be eliminated for ever.  We  are  concerned  about  it  being
lifted only for an unspecified period of time to be determined  by  the  hon
the President at a later time, and possibly  not  for  many  times,  as  the
President wishes to, even selectively,  in  respect  of  some  but  not  all
legislatures.

The antidefection clause could be lifted for few a hours, a few  days  or  a
few months here but not there, or once-off, whether it is right or  wrong  -
no one is to know beforehand. If there is a matter of principle  behind  the
political expedience, then the antidefection clause should be abolished  for
ever.

We are concerned about the rules being amended after  some  of  the  players
have decided how they are going to play the  game.  We  are  also  concerned
about continuing the practice  that  the  Constitution  may  be  amended  to
change the rules of the game time and again  by  a  simple  majority  rather
than through the usual reinforced majority. Moreover, the actual content  of
the amendment is  defined  by  presidential  proclamations.  There  must  be
rules, even in changing the rules, and here it  seems  that  rules  will  be
made as required and expedient from  time  to  time.  We  must  improve  the
system of government to make it stronger and  better.  Good  governance  can
only take place in a system  in  which  the  rule  of  man  can  finally  be
replaced by the rule of law, so that all  can  play  by  the  rules  and  be
subject to them.

Our province is committed to the type of democracy  that  we  entrenched  in
our Constitution. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The PREMIER  OF  MPUMALANGA  (Mr  N  J  Mahlangu):  Madam  Chairperson,  hon
President, hon premiers and hon  members,  our  congratulations  go  to  hon
Premier Molefe on being elected as Rotating Deputy Chairperson.  We  do  not
need to lecture the  premier  on  what  is  expected  of  him,  because  the
Constitution is there and he is an old horse at this job.

In the past 10 months we travelled the length and breadth of  our  province,
talking to and working with our people. During our daily  contact  with  the
people, we listened and learnt from them. We did this through our  community
outreach programme and through imbizos.

In that way we were able to touch base with almost every  village  and  town
of our municipalities in the province. What struck us most was the  keenness
of the majority of our people to be part of the process  of  rebuilding  the
country, a process that will guarantee a better life for all.

That keenness, that willingness to participate in the  construction  of  our
province and our country, places a profound obligation on the  shoulders  of
each one of us, particularly the elected representatives of the  people.  It
also  places  an  obligation  and  responsibility  on  the  private  sector,
organised  business,  the  labour  movement,   the   religious   fraternity,
teachers, parents, farmers, in fact, all of us.

When we spoke to our people earlier this year, we told  them  that  all  our
joint and shared activities would be driven by a  desire  to  lift  everyone
out of poverty.  We  also  told  them  how  far  we  have  gone  in  getting
communities involved in becoming masters of their own fate.

As the  Mpumalanga  provincial  government,  we  have  always  said  we  are
committed to engaging citizen  voices  in  local,  regional  and  provincial
governance in new ways. We  realised  early  in  our  interaction  with  the
communities that honesty  was  essential  to  break  through  the  citizens'
distrust of institutions. As we listened and  interacted  with  people  from
every walk of life and in vastly different circumstances, we heard  constant
themes over time of what  supported  people  being  involved  and  what  the
barriers were to people being involved in the community's work.  The  common
voice in all the communities we visited indicated an overwhelming desire  to
be lifted out of poverty.
Through the  dedication  and  co-operation  of  members  of  the  Mpumalanga
provincial government, in partnership  with  business  and  working  closely
with the community, we ensured that more than  250  000  people  are  active
beneficiaries of social grants, as at 31 March 2001.

During the same period, the number  of  child  support  grant  beneficiaries
stood at 69 792. The monthly average uptake rate in  respect  of  the  child
support grant is more than 5 000 children. Social development  projects  are
implemented in a co-ordinated manner,  with  all  relevant  departments  and
stakeholders participating.

This concept is being cultivated vigorously through the  social  cluster  of
the executive council, in  which  the  district  mayors  and  the  executive
mayors of our four strategic towns are participating.

The community-based Public Works programme is a specific  job  creation  and
poverty alleviation programme targeted primarily  at  the  rural  poor.  Our
objective is to create short and long-term  employment,  sustainable  public
assets and  provide  accredited  training  to  communities  in  the  poverty
pockets of the province.

The programme's budget of  R6,2  million  was  used  to  fund  five  cluster
projects in the three districts of the province. In the  Ehlanzeni  district
the communities of Shabalala next to  Hazyview  constructed  a  multipurpose
centre, a community garden and market stalls, including two poultry  houses,
for an amount of R1,4 million. In the Eastvaal  district  the  community  of
Perdekop received R1,4 million to construct a sports stadium,  five  poultry
houses and a community garden.

The community of Davel decided to use R1,2 million  to  construct  a  sports
facility that  included  tennis  and  basketball  courts.  In  the  Nkangala
district the community of Vaalbank constructed six poultry houses valued  at
R740 000. In Kameelrivier an existing sports stadium was upgraded  for  R1,5
million. During the construction of all the projects 480 people, among  them
197 women, were employed and 209 people were trained.

We are also happy to announce that the  MEC  for  public  works,  roads  and
transport recently launched a  multimillion  rand  project  to  upgrade  the
Moloto Road. The Moloto Road, members will remember,  has  been  dubbed  the
``killer road'' of the province, if not the country. We plan to  build  this
road in three phases. We have put aside R61 million for the  current  phase.
It is our firm belief that the project will result in the  employment  of  a
number of people. The number of people employed  will  increase  at  a  very
late stage of the project.

Our target of providing 20 000 housing units  is  within  grasp.  More  than
7 000 new houses have been built and handed  over  to  beneficiaries.  Seven
thousand houses have had their ownership transferred  through  the  discount
benefit scheme. More than 1 400 housing units are  under  construction,  and
over 3 000 are being processed for board approval.

In our recent fortnight outreach programme  in  Daantjie  and  Msogwaba,  we
could see the smiles on the faces of people as they took  ownership  of  the
new tarred roads we were launching. We still hear their voices as  they  say
thank you for what has been done, and continues  to  be  done  in  improving
their lives.

In the past week we launched the Daantjie and Luphisi  Road,  phase  two  of
the Daantjie-Goboza Road in the Mbombela municipal area.  In  attendance  at
the  imbizos  held  afterwards  were  communities  of  Daantjie,   Msogwaba,
Spelenyane, the Tekwane and Karino farms, Ka-Nyamazane  and  Matsulu  A.  If
that is anything to go by, then we are  convinced  that  we  are  indeed  in
touch with our people.

May I also mention that amongst the things we did with the community in  the
past week was to discuss the plight of farm dwellers and farmworkers in  the
province, to hand over funds for disaster relief in the  Volkrust  area  and
to launch indigenous games at Embalenhle. These  were  part  of  the  imbizo
programme during this past week.
Throughout the  week  the  provincial  health  department  took  its  health
awareness programme to the schools,  while  the  provincial  social  service
department held a successful national  Children's  Day  celebration  at  the
Mbuzini Stadium.

 More pregnant women in the province now  have  access  to  maternal  health
care through the clinics we built in deep  rural  areas,  like  Mmamethlake,
Lefiso, Kabokweni, Phake, Verena and Daggakraal.

One of the key challenges in the education sector  was  the  restoration  of
public confidence in the integrity of our matric results.  I  can  say  with
confidence that this objective has been successfully realised. That  is  why
it was relatively easy to root out the person who tried to cook the  outcome
of this year's results. We have completed  a  number  of  new  schools,  new
classrooms, new administration blocks and toilets.

More than 160 poverty alleviation projects are up and running this year.  As
the provincial government, we continue to place high on the agenda the  task
of ensuring that all of us act together to  achieve  a  high  and  sustained
rate of growth in our economy.

A   co-ordinated   approach   between   the   provincial   government    and
municipalities in Mpumalanga is starting to bear dividends. Once a month  we
have our three executive council clusters sitting, with all district  mayors
and executive mayors of our four strategic towns. At  that  meeting  members
of the executives of the three clusters discuss project planning  and  other
matters of common interest with the municipal councillors.

These meetings are preceded by  technical  cluster  meetings  consisting  of
municipal managers and heads of provincial departments under the  leadership
of  the  provincial  director-general.  These  technical  cluster   meetings
prepare for the political cluster referred to. We remain convinced  that  it
is only through the creation of a close partnership between the  public  and
private sector that we can have a growth path that absorbs  labour,  reduces
inequality, and promotes  international  competitiveness  accompanied  by  a
process of empowerment.

We are developing the tourism  industry  so  as  to  create  more  jobs.  We
initiated,  assisted  and  supported  the  development  of  21  new  tourism
projects. Ten of these are up and running, while the rest will  follow  suit
in the new financial year. Nine existing  tourism  projects  were  supported
and enhanced. These projects have led to the creation of  94  permanent  and
582 temporary jobs.

In order to explore the opportunities offered by the global trade  strategy,
the relevant department launched the SME export  strategy  together  with  a
provincial  export  forum  and  regional  forums.  More  than  31  potential
exporters were assisted.

The Mpumalanga investment initiative established  a  vehicle  for  assisting
the business sector, especially small business, to access the  international
market. Through our assistance, two individual emerging  entrepreneurs  from
the black community  managed  to  secure  lucrative  export  contracts.  One
secured an export contract with the  Namibian  government  to  supply  field
stoves, and  provide  repairs  and  maintenance  of  military  machines  and
vehicles, while the other secured and export contract for leather products.

On the  mining  front,  we  have  facilitated  the  establishment  of  eight
manufacturing  businesses  to  the  value  of  R32,4   million   and   three
acquisitions and/or mergers between  foreign  and  local  companies  to  the
value of R195 million. Five  projects  to  the  value  of  R20  million  are
currently in the process of being established in the province.

Regarding HIV/Aids projects, we are on  course.  Our  Aids  ambassadors  are
hard at work. We have also planned school transport  for  farm  areas  which
will cover the whole province, and we plan that by the beginning of  January
no child will travel by foot from the rural farms of the province  but  will
have school transport.

We appreciate and accept the instruction from the  President  that  managers
should manage their institutions, such as the boiler which is  not  working,
of course, which does not need high levels of power. We accept that  and  we
are taking it along, whilst also accepting the fact that we must go  to  the
people, get criticism from them and learn from them. That is  the  only  way
to govern. We are aware that we need to  work  harder.  We  need  political,
civic and corporate leadership from people who have  vision  and  understand
the importance of listening to all voices in the community, in the same  way
that we need community activists who have vision, have  self-initiative  and
focus on the common good.

We believe that the activation of the 11  public  information  terminals  in
the  province  will  enable  community-wide  and  region-wide  dialogue  and
deliberation. We  must  integrate  high  tech  and  high  touch  to  support
authentic dialogue. In the process, we  will  also  need  print  media,  and
television and radio that embrace community  or  public  journalism  values.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP:  Order!  Hon  member,  allow  me  to  briefly
interrupt our proceedings. I have not called upon  you,  hon  member.  If  I
could interrupt our proceedings to indicate that as well as members  of  the
executive from the provinces, we have with us the elected office bearers  of
our institutions  in  the  provinces,  the  speakers  of  a  number  of  our
provincial legislatures. I just would like to indicate their presence  here.
They support the work of the NCOP very greatly, and I am pleased  that  they
could join us today.

We have Mr Smith of the Northern Cape provincial legislature; Speaker  Doman
of the Western Cape provincial  legislature;  and  I  think  I  see  Speaker
Matomela, yes I do, of the Eastern Cape provincial legislature.  I  am  most
pleased that you could be here. It is not often that you are able  to  share
these debates with us, but you certainly support our work in that regard.  I
welcome you all. [Applause.]

It is now my pleasure  to  call  upon  the  hon  Mr  Ndebele,  the  MEC  for
transport in KwaZulu-Natal.
Mr J S NDEBELE (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson,  hon  President,  premiers  and
colleagues, the first real delivery to our people started about  this  time,
90 years ago, when Dr Pixley ka Seme called for us to unite as a people  who
are Venda, yes, but South African; Zulu, yes, but South  African;  and  that
gave us an identity, dignity and a vision of a common future.

The President has done more  than  anyone  to  promote  this  country  as  a
country of hope that respects that human  dignity.  But  dignity  is  not  a
given, it needs to be defended at all times. I just want to remark,  as  the
longest serving MEC for transport in this country, that one of my  tasks  is
to implement the Road Traffic Act. [Laughter.]  [Applause.]  There  is  zero
tolerance in our province,  something  which  is  known  worldwide.  Drunken
driving carries a maximum sentence of  six  years.  Drunken  driving  is  an
aggravating, not a mitigating factor, as seems to have happened  -  I  would
like to say to Premier Direko - in Bloemfontein, her province.

The 1580 judgment of Hendricks v Hopkins  says:  ``Let  him  who  sins  when
drunk be punished when  sober.''  [Laughter.]  To  plead  drunkenness  as  a
mitigating factor is like a person killing both his mother and  his  father,
and then pleading for mercy on the grounds of being an orphan. [Laughter.]

In a judgment in 1962 former President Mandela said  that  he  felt  like  a
black man in a white man's court. I think Mrs Mampuru feels the same way  in
2001, and I think that judgment, which was  passed  in  Bloemfontein,  is  a
shame for all of us.

As KwaZulu-Natal begins to rub her eyes at the prospect of peace,  she  also
fully recognises that the dead are not only dead for  the  duration  of  the
war, they are  dead  forever.  The  past  is  still  too  close.  The  work,
therefore, is the creation of peace, not merely an end to the  conflict  and
violence, but an end to the beginning of all wars and all conflicts.

Our coalition government in KwaZulu-Natal  is  based  on  three  principles:
peace, democracy and development, in that order. But the grim fact  is  that
when we prepared for war, we did so like precautions giants, and  as  we  go
towards peace, we move like retarded pygmies.

KwaZulu-Natal is not just a province, but a whole climate  of  opinions.  If
one sees two of us, there  are  three  opinions.  [Laughter.]  This  is  the
province which is  the  litmus  test  whether  nonracialism  and  multiparty
democracy will work and modern democratic  structures  will  live  alongside
traditional leadership. It is on this that I want to remark.

We have three examples in Southern Africa, KwaZulu-Natal perhaps  being  the
fourth. We have Botswana which decided very early on that it  was  going  to
be a Republic, and therefore anyone who wanted to  be  elected  to  anything
must be elected, not born into it. We also have  Lesotho,  which  said  that
they would have traditional structures alongside democratic  structures.  It
has tensions, but it works. Then there is Swaziland - I will  come  back  to
that later.
What have we learned from the  coexistence  of  democratic  structures  with
traditional structures? Members  will  remember  that  on  19  April  former
President Mandela, iNkosi Buthelezi, former  President  De  Klerk  and  Prof
Okomo signed a famous document.  The  document  said  that  the  undersigned
parties agreed to recognise and protect the institutions,  status  and  role
of the constitutional position of the King of the Zulus, and the Kingdom  of
KwaZulu,  which  institutions  shall  be  provided  for  in  the  provincial
constitution  of  KwaZulu-Natal  immediately  after  the  holding   of   the
elections.

If there is any delay, it will be a delay by  the  KwaZulu-Natal  provincial
legislature. One cannot  have  a  national  law  regulating  that.  Amakhosi
ngamakhosi endawo. [Amakhosi are local leaders.] They are  local,  and  they
are therefore provided for in the local constitution.  This  is  the  solemn
undertaking that we as a province, not the  national  Government,  have  not
carried out. But what is the role of traditional  leaders,  particularly  if
one talks about delivery? Traditional leaders are symbols of unity. That  is
why in Lesotho, for instance, all parties flocked to the palace  when  there
was conflict in that country. This is because the king is the king,  whether
one belongs to  this  party  or  that.  Therefore  traditional  leaders  are
traditional leaders for all parties.

They are preservers of culture, identity, heritage  and  collective  memory.
They are the number-one peace officers. They  are  law  and  order,  whether
there is conflict in the family or in the village.  They  guarantee  freedom
of association and freedom  after  association.  They  fulfil  the  role  of
justices in which they summon, try and sentence.

They are champions of development and they  play  a  developmental  role  in
reversing apartheid. They sit  and  discuss  the  question  of  land  use  -
residential, agricultural or grazing. As hon members  know,  in  most  areas
one can invest R1 billion in the building of  roads  there.  However,  there
are places that roads can never reach,  because  people  have  built  houses
mainly to run away from colonial administration  and  apartheid  with  their
pass laws. Such houses  were  built  in  such  a  way  people  could  see  a
policeman seven kilometres away.

One cannot bring water or electricity to these places. One needs a new  plan
for  land  use  that  will  work  out  these  things,   such   as   housing,
infrastructure, electricity, water, telephones  and  so  forth.  Traditional
leaders have a key role to play  in  that  regard.  Therefore  there  is  no
question of reducing their powers, because there is quite a  lot  that  they
have to do in partnership with democratic structures.

The third example we have in Southern Africa is, of  course,  Swaziland.  In
Swaziland the divine right of kings goes back to 1789. It is  not  going  to
be communism or Western intellectuals that  will  destroy  the  monarchy  in
Swaziland:  it  will  be  the  monarchy  and  its  advisers,  as  they   are
responsible for putting the traditional leadership in conflict with  elected
structures.

Nasekukhulunywa  kutsiwa  yingidzangidzane  umlomo   longacali   manga   ...
[Kuhlaba  lulwimi.]  ...  kutsiwe  kuyawuhlalwa   ngaphansi   kweTinkhundla!
[Luhleko.] [Locals usually refer to something that has been uttered  by  the
monarchy as having come from a mouth that speaks  no  lie.  [Interjections.]
They also talk about going  to  sit  under  the  tiNkhundla  [a  traditional
system of governance]. [Laughter.]]

I was in Swaziland when ingonyama tore up the constitution. If it should  go
that way, it will go the same way as  France,  Russia,  Iran  and  Ethiopia,
which is in conflict with the people. It cannot survive that way.

This is what we need to discuss, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal. Nobody  else
can. I agree, let us speak of traditional leaders, but  let  us  speak  more
about women under traditional rule, let us speak more about  the  rights  of
rural residents, let us speak more about the  right  to  associate,  let  us
speak more about the rights of  ordinary  citizens  to  develop  and  freely
control circumstances concerning their lives.

We have an army of developers.  We  have  MPs,  members  of  the  provincial
legislatures, councillors  and  public  servants  in  the  local,  district,
provincial and national structures. In addition, this democratic  Government
has also elevated traditional leaders to a level where they  are  paid  more
than most graduates. We therefore have that whole army that must tackle  the
backwardness of development.

In the izimbizos that we have had - and my colleague Joyce has  referred  to
this - we have seen, for instance, the indunas,  mayors,  amakhosi,  members
of the provincial legislatures, MPs, MECs  and  Ministers  coming  together.
Republicans of all parties - ANC, IFP, New NP and  DP  have  been  persuaded
and convinced that it is correct and proper  that  democracy  coexists  with
traditional leadership. They have been convinced.

Similarly, it is crucial and critical  that  traditional  leaders  recognise
that they can coexist with democracy. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I am afraid your time has  expired,  hon
Ndebele. Despite my fear of traditional leaders, I am  forced  to  stop  you
and call upon the President of the Republic,  President  Mbeki,  to  address
the Council. [Applause.]

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Chairperson, is it not  possible  for  me  to
cede some of my time to the hon Ndebele so that he can  finish  his  speech?
[Laughter.]

Let me join our Chairperson in expressing my appreciation for  the  presence
in the House of the speakers of the provincial legislatures. I think  it  is
important that they should be here. I would like to  thank  them  very  much
for their presence. I would also like to say thank  you  very  much  to  the
community volunteers who have stayed with us  throughout  the  afternoon.  I
hope that they heard what these members of Government are saying and I  hope
that will help to improve the interaction between them, the  volunteers  and
the Government structures. By working together we can indeed  speed  up  the
process of change in our country.
There are two things that we need to do, if the Chairperson  agrees.  Before
I get to that, perhaps I should say that when the Chairperson said  that  we
had a delegation from the People's Republic of China, I hoped that the  NCOP
would congratulate the Chinese parliamentarians on China joining  the  World
Trade Organisation. [Applause.] It was an important step  in  terms  of  the
international relations of China. We have  supported  this  process,  having
discussed it with the Chinese leadership some years back.

It would be appropriated - I hope this may have been done already - for  the
NCOP to send a message of solidarity and sympathy  to  Algeria  after  these
rains and floods that have claimed  the  lives  of  hundreds  of  people  in
Algiers. I am quite certain that the Algerian people would appreciate that.

Secondly, this House should send a message to the people of New York in  the
United States and the Dominican Republic regarding the plane  crash  in  New
York yesterday. These tragedies seem to occur too frequently. I think it  is
important, if the House agrees, that it should communicate those matters.

There are many questions that have been raised. I think all  of  us  are  of
one mind, namely that we need to  sustain  and  intensify  this  process  of
interaction with our people so as to improve the impact  of  the  system  of
governance on our people. We should improve it in  all  sorts  of  ways.  We
should improve it, in part, by ensuring that  it  is  indeed  responsive  to
what the people say. I think we are agreed about that, and I hope  that  the
NCOP will find a way of monitoring how we  do  that  in  order  to  make  an
assessment as to whether members of this National Council are  participating
properly with regard to that process.

I thought the matter raised by Premier Dipico  about  what  happens  in  the
Northern Cape regarding the verification by the  provincial  legislature  of
what the executive had said was important. The NCOP might  want  to  do  the
same thing with regard to all provincial governments. That is  an  important
part of ensuring that our country proceeds as it should.
There have been many questions, and we probably do not have enough  time  to
deal with all of them in detail. I believe we were  supposed  to  be  having
drinks at six. It is now after six. [Laughter.]

I would like to agree with the hon Piet Matthee and the hon Gouws when  they
draw attention to the issue of crime. I agree with the hon Matthee  that  we
can shorten the periods which were mentioned by the Deputy President.  I  do
not see why we should not, and I think we should have a  look  at  that.  In
that context, the hon Matthee also referred to international  levels.  I  am
not quite sure what is meant by that. London, for instance, has much  higher
rates of car theft than South Africa  has.  So,  is  that  an  international
level to which we should aspire? [Interjections.] I am not so sure.

I know countries in Western Europe which have higher rates of car  hijacking
than we have. I do not think we should aspire  to  those  standards  either.
There are countries in the world where the children are taken to school  and
fetched from school by helicopter. That does not happen in this country.  It
might be useful for members of the  Council  to  have  a  look  at  what  is
happening regarding this issue of crime globally. I think if they did  that,
they would come to  understand  that  South  Africa  is  not  the  exclusive
catastrophe that it is presented to be.

We have a problem, and we have to deal with  it.  But  it  is  incorrect  to
present South Africa as though it is the very home and the very  epitome  of
crime in the world. It is not. It might be useful if members had a  look  at
that.

It is important that - the hon Herandien mentioned  this  -  the  census  be
properly conducted.  It  should  cover  everybody,  as  Government  is  very
interested that it should give as accurate a picture of  what  is  happening
in our country as possible. I would like to think that Statistics  SA  would
want to make sure that that happens. The Minister of Finance addressed  this
issue last week and affirmed that we will  make  sure  that  nobody  is  not
counted in. It is important, because we  cannot  proceed  on  the  basis  of
false information about the country, as so often happens in this country.

The hon Herandien said we  probably  needed  to  intervene  with  regard  to
matters of land restitution  and  employment.  I  would  certainly  be  most
interested to hear what the views of the hon acting premier were about  this
in terms of what needs to happen specifically. I  had  the  impression  that
the  land  restitution  process,  particularly  in  the  Western  Cape,  was
proceeding quite well. A number of communities have  received  land,  and  I
think that has made some impact. This  particular  province  has  also  been
leading  with  regard  to  matters  of  economic  growth,  development   and
employment.

However, if the hon acting premier had some specific ideas  with  regard  to
these two matters, I would most certainly be willing to look at them to  see
what sort of interventions are required at the national level  to  speed  up
these particular two processes in the Western Cape.

We have been raising this question of what went wrong in this  country  with
regard to the levels of morality for some  time.  It  is  one  our  national
challenges, and all of us need to act together to correct  that  which  went
wrong. It was therefore  correct  that  mention  was  made  here  of  recent
instances of reported child rape, the role of alcoholism and the  commission
of crime, and that we must act together to address this issue.

It is important, and it is one of these kind of questions, as  I  have  been
saying for some time, that should not be debased by politicising  them.  The
point that was made by Kent Durr, and to some extent by the hon  Rasool,  of
elevating and ennobling our politics and restoring faith in  Government  and
the political process has to do with things of  this  kind.  We  should  not
have political squabbles about a matter of this kind,  but  rather  say,  as
South Africans, we are all equally grievously offended by  these  incidences
of rape, whether of children or  women  generally,  alcohol  abuse  or  drug
abuse generally, which leads to all sorts of crime in our country, and  that
we need to act very firmly together on these matters.

This will be part of the process of ennobling our politics, and part of  the
process of restoring the people's confidence  in  our  political  processes.
Perhaps the NCOP might again want to see in what  ways  it  encourages  that
process of  a  united  national  response  to  what  clearly  are  important
national challenges.

I do not need to say much on  the  matter  of  the  emancipation  of  women,
except to say that in the process of the NCOP assessing the  functioning  of
Government, it needs to focus on this particular  question  to  see  whether
all of these programmes that we have put in place, and which we will put  in
place, address this issue as an integral part of everything that we do,  not
as a matter to which we refer incidentally. I  think  that  monitoring  that
assessment is important, including, as the hon Themba  said,  the  issue  of
the functioning of our gender machineries.  That  would  make  an  important
input in terms of ensuring that we do indeed advance  with  regard  to  this
important issue.

The hon Nyakane mentioned the difficult question  of  illegal  workers  from
Zimbabwe in the Northern Province. I would like to agree with him,  in  that
this matter should be treated as humanely as is possible. We have a  bit  of
a problem here in that we cannot, in the process of dealing with the  matter
humanely, say that Home Affairs should break the law. It is  important  that
the Department of Home Affairs should  implement  the  law  with  regard  to
people who are illegal in this country, but,  clearly,  we  need  to  handle
this matter in a sensitive way so as not to add to the problems of  Zimbabwe
and certainly not to fan any xenophobia among our own people.

It therefore indeed needs to be handled sensitively  within  the  spirit  of
ubuntu, which the hon Nyakane mentioned. However, we need  also  to  enforce
the law and look at, as has been said with regard to people  who  have  been
in this country for 15 years, what we did, because as Government,  precisely
because of the approach of ubuntu, we did say some  years  back  that  those
people from our region who have been in  our  country  for  more  than  five
years illegally should apply for citizenship. And those who did  apply  were
granted citizenship. I do  not  know  why  others  would  have  missed  that
particular opportunity, but certainly I agree that we have to  approach  the
matter with all due sensitivity.

I would really like to assure the hon Ngubane that there is  nobody  at  all
in Government who is interested in violating the rule of law. There is  not.
If there are going to be changes to the Constitution, those changes will  be
carried out according to the prescriptions contained  in  the  Constitution,
not by any simple majority. So I do not think that there is any  fear  about
this. Such legislation, as has been introduced, will of course be  discussed
by all the parties  in  Parliament,  and  people  will  make  their  various
inputs. I imagine that out of that would come a common view.

I had understood that there  was  a  general  feeling  among  the  political
parties that there should be some space allowed  for  people  to  cross  the
floor. I thought that this was a common view. I might be  wrong.  Therefore,
should this happen now, perhaps expedited by  problems  that  are  happening
amongst some of the political parties, the principle  in  itself  is  not  a
problem. This is because everybody,  I  had  thought,  had  felt  that  this
matter needed to be attended to to give some space for people to be able  to
cross the floor.

Anyway, as far as the matter is being discussed now, I  am  saying  that  it
will be carried out, that discussion must take place in Parliament  and  any
changes that take place, if any,  must  be  carried  out  according  to  the
Constitution and according to the rule of law. Therefore, I do  not  imagine
that the fear that the hon Ngubane entertains that something is going to  be
done that is illegal, will in fact happen. It will not happen.

The hon Shilowa mentioned an important matter about  globalisation  and  the
need for us to respond to that particular process  in  a  way  that  ensures
that our people do not get marginalised, do not get  impoverished.  I  think
that is a correct approach, and that it requires all sorts of things,  among
overselves, to make sure that our society as a whole  is  indeed  responsive
to that particular process.

Two days ago our Minister of Foreign Affairs,  Nkosazana  Dlamini-Zuma;  the
Director-General in the  Presidency,  Frank  Chikane;  others  from  Foreign
Affairs; as well as certain presidents and I were in New York. Two people  -
one a leader from  the  developed  countries  and  one  a  leader  from  the
developing countries - both said, but separately,  that  when  South  Africa
speaks the world listens. They both explained why. Part of  the  reason  was
because of some of the matters raised in this  House:  issues  raised  about
our pursuit of  peace,  of  democracy,  of  development  -  raised  in  this
instance with respect to KwaZulu-Natal. This is part of that  process  which
results in South Africa being listened to when South Africa speaks.

A matter was raised of the need for us - and it was mentioned by all  of  us
here - to ensure that we strengthen local government, strengthen  management
- the hon Mkhatshwa mentioned this - so as  to  ensure  that  we  do  indeed
change the lives of our people  for  the  better.  That  commitment  to  the
improvement of the  lives  of  our  people,  and  of  not  merely  occupying
positions of government and being comfortable there and  forgetting  why  we
are there, is, I think, part of what  makes  the  world  listen  when  South
Africa speaks.

The way we have approached the institution of traditional leadership  which,
in fact, had been essentially discredited by the system of  colonialism  and
apartheid, when we said we respect this institution and must look  again  at
its place and role and the dignity of the office, I think that too  is  what
makes South Africa listened to  when  South  Africa  speaks.  I,  therefore,
would like  to  say  in  connection  with  that  particular  matter  of  the
traditional leaders that it is important that we  also  do  not  treat  this
matter as a political football, but that we treat it seriously. We  are  all
of us serious about addressing this issue.

There are various issues that were agreed on as to how we should proceed  in
order to ensure the resolution of this matter. It is not correct that  there
are promises that have not been fulfilled. That is not  correct.  There  are
processes that were agreed on and  those  processes  are  ongoing.  I  would
really like to hope that this  matter  should  not  be  treated,  as  I  was
saying, as a political football, as an issue of tension,  but  as  rather  a
matter that we must all engage  in  constructively  so  that  we  do  indeed
realise the common objective of securing the proper  place  for  traditional
leaders in our country.

Premier Mahlangu mentioned the matter of the role of the media. I  think  we
must continue to interact with the media, to communicate our  views  to  the
media, to communicate what we are doing, to report to the media and  so  on,
and to do so actively, consistently and systematically. Certainly,  that  is
what the editors complained about the last  time  we  met,  that  Government
does not do this and that when they do not report us properly, we  complain,
but that in many instances the fault lies with us. So, I think, we  must  do
this process of communication consistently, without  giving  up.  Indeed,  I
think, in time the media, as all of us have done, will develop  and  outgrow
its older baggage in order to be responsive  to  these  processes  that  are
taking place in our country.

I must say that I did not at all notice that the hon Kent Durr  had  a  hand
in his pocket. [Laughter.] I did notice that premier Mahlangu had  his  hand
in his pocket. [Laughter.] It is a common problem. Sometimes  one  does  not
know what to do with one's hands. I would not worry too much about it, if  I
were the hon Kgoali.

As for kissing frogs ... [Laughter.] ... I would like to hear from  the  hon
Botha how it feels. [Laughter.] It may also be  that  we  already  have  too
many princes in our country. Perhaps we should stop kissing  them,  so  that
we do not add to the princes that we have.

I agree with the hon Manne Dipico. We should arrive  alive.  We  should  not
drink and drive. The hon Sbu Ndebele has told  us  about  the  penalties  in
KwaZulu-Natal which are imposed when one  is  sober  and  not  when  one  is
drunk.

A merry Christmas and a happy New Year to all members of the  NCOP.  Let  us
all be back here next year very much alive. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Our  thanks  to  the  President  of  the
Republic for having once more  introduced  a  most  interesting  debate  and
insight regarding progress in our country. Our debate  is  now  at  an  end.
Before hon members rush to the  doors  for  the  drink  that  the  President
strangely made reference to, I must ask hon members to remain  seated  until
the Chairperson and the President have left the Chamber.

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 18:23.

         The  Mediation  Committee,  having  considered  the  Cultural  Laws
         Second Amendment Bill [B 46B and B 46D - 2000]  (National  Assembly
         - sec 76), as well  as  the  papers  referred  to  it,  reports  as
         follows:


         1.  The  Cultural  Laws  Second  Amendment  Bill  [B  46B  -  2000]

         3. Upon referral  of  the  latter  amended  Bill  to  the  National
              Assembly, that House did not accept the amendments  passed  by

         5. The effect of this decision is that the Secretary to  Parliament
              is required to submit the latter version of the Bill  to  both
              the Speaker of the Assembly and the Chairperson of the Council
              in terms of  Joint  Rule  188(3),  for  consideration  by  the
              Assembly and the Council.


         6.  The  Committee  therefore  submits  the  Cultural  Laws  Second
              Amendment Bill [B 46F - 2000] (National Assembly  -  sec  76),
              and recommends that the Assembly and  the  Council  pass  this
              mediated version.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Joint Budget Committee on the  Medium  Term  Expenditure
     Framework, dated 13 November 2001:


     The Joint Budget Committee report as follows:


     A Introduction


         The terms of reference of the Committee was:


         1. To analise  and  debate  the  2001  Medium  Term  Budget  Policy
              Statement (MTBPS).


         2. To conduct hearings on the  Medium  Term  Expenditure  Framework
              (MTEF) and the Division of Revenue Bill.


         3. To engage in the budgeting process throughout the  budget  cycle
              in order to allow Parliament  to  have  an  input  during  the
              drafting stage of the budget.


         The Committee was formed on 30 October 2001, the same day that  the
         MTBPS  was  tabled.  In  an  effort  to  interrogate  the  spending
         priorities of national departments, as outlined in the  MTBPS,  the
         Committee invited the following participants:


         (a)     National departments, as mentioned in the MTBPS.


         (b)     Civil society.


         (c)     Business leaders.


         (d)     Chairpersons of Portfolio and Select Committees.


         The Intergovernmental Fiscal Review (IGFR) formed a basis  for  the
         discussion on the Division of Revenue.


         The broad policy priorities of the government over the Medium  Term
         Expenditure Framework  (MTEF)  is  the  "reduction  of  poverty  to
         alleviate inequality and vulnerability". The context in which  this
         can be  achieved,  is  through  the  following  priorities  of  the
         national government, as listed in the MTBPS:


         *  "Continued  emphasis  on  investment  in,  and  maintenance  and
              rehabilitation of infrastructure, enhancing South Africa's job
              creation and economic growth prospects over the medium to long
              term".


         *   "Strengthening  programmes  that  address  the  impact  of  the
              HIV/AIDS epidemic".


         *  "Rebuilding Local Governments and meeting commitments to  ensure
              free basic service delivery".


         *  "Strengthening capacity in the safety  and  security  sector  to
              prevent and combat crime".


         *  "Restructuring national entities, specifically the  Unemployment
              Insurance Fund and  the  SA  Post  Office,  enabling  them  to
              improve the quality and access to service delivery".


         *   "Further  strengthening  of  tax  administration  capacity  and
              establishing a financial intelligence centre to assist  global
              efforts in combating money laundering".


     B South Africa's macroeconomic environment


         The government's commitment to budgetary restraint  over  the  past
         five years has produced a reduction in borrowing and debts  service
         costs.  The  resulting  increase  investor   confidence,   led   to
         increases  in  gross  domestic   fixed   investment,   which   will
         facilitate strong real growth  in  spending  over  the  next  three
         years while  still  maintaining  a  sound  and  sustainable  fiscal
         policy  stance.  In  addition,  improved  efficiency   in   revenue
         collection has improved tax compliance and  tax  morale,  resulting
         in additional resources to reduce government debt and provide  room
         for tax cuts.


     C Benefit of depreciating rand


         The depreciating rand to the dollar  has  benefitted  the  economy,
         mainly in  encouraging  higher  and  more  diversified  exports  of
         manufactured  goods  and  services,  leading  to  the  increase  in
         competitiveness of our exports and sustaining  growth.  However,  a
         depreciated  rand  raises  the  cost  of  imported  technology  and
         services to  maintain  our  competitive  advantage  in  the  export
         market.


     D.     Resilience of economy contributing to relative growth


         The current momentum in economic growth places South  Africa  in  a
         rather comfortable position to  respond  to  the  downturn  in  the
         world economy with an appropriate mix of  tax  relief,  accelerated
         infrastructure spending and further capital expenditure  on  social
         services and municipal  infrastructure  providing  real  growth  in
         public spending. The European Union Commission's  report  on  South
         Africa indicates that trade is up by 35%, in rand terms,  with  the
         slowdown in the European economy not expected to be as big as  that
         of the United States. The United States is expected, after  the  11
         September attacks, to  begin  substantial  public  spending  and  a
         series  of  interest  rates  cuts  to  stimulate  growth  in  their
         economy, should improve the economic outlook  for  next  year.  The
         European  Union  has  already  started  implementing  monetary  and
         fiscal policies to stimulate growth, leading to further demands  in
         our export market. Further increases in  stability  and  confidence
         in our economy is expected to come from an upgrading of our credit-
         worthiness from  Moody's  next  year.  This  will  also  result  in
         increased fixed investment and reduced borrowing cost.


     E.     Tax policy and administration


         The restructuring of SARS along with other tax reforms has  enabled
         more revenue to be collected at a lower tax rate,  contributing  to
         both a steady improvement in the fiscal position  and  further  tax
         relief. Two most significant changes  to  the  tax  structure  have
         been the change  from  a  source-based  tax  to  a  residence-based
         income tax, with the introduction of capital gains tax.  Residence-
         based income tax adds to the fiscus by taxing the foreign  earnings
         of South  African  companies  and  individual.  Capital  gains  tax
         remedies  a  fundamental  deficiency  in  the  income  tax  regime,
         thereby improving  the  overall  equity  and  efficiency  of  South
         Africa's tax system.


         As part of  the  drive  to  stimulate  growth  in  the  economy  by
         creating  jobs,  a  wage  incentive  aimed   at   encouraging   the
         employment of learners has been introduced. This wage incentive  is
         set to encourage job creation by reducing the cost  of  hiring  new
         workers and to increase the skills base by  offering  learnerships.
         It  is  also  to  encourage  the  formalisation  of  the   informal
         employment sector, which will see further contributions to the  UIF
         and  other  goverment  programmes,   ultimately   benefitting   the
         workers.


     F.     Improvement in savings and investments  by  national  government
         and households


         The monetary policies pursued by the government  have  resulted  in
         declining interest rates. Inflation targeting  by  the  SA  Reserve
         Bank in the band of 6 to 3  per  cent  has  led  to  certainty  for
         investors.  Low  inflation  results  in  more   disposable   income
         benefiting  poor  people.  Both  investments  and  savings  in  our
         economy have shown signs of recovery  with  Gross  domestic  saving
         rising from 14.3 to 15.3 per cent of GDP from  1998  to  the  first
         half of 2001. Declining interest rates and  inflation  is  expected
         to accelerate gross fixed capital formation contributing to  growth
         in our economy, rising from 2.6 per cent in  2001  to  average  3.3
         per cent over the next three years.


     G.     Competitiveness


         The Department of Trade and Industry has also highlighted the  need
         for the increase in quality of raw  materials  produced  to  ensure
         competitiveness of South African exports. Examples  mentioned  were
         improvements needed in the quality  of  leather  produced  for  the
         motor vehicle industry in order to ensure exportable  quality.  The
         department is also involved in advising SMMEs and  entrepeneurs  to
         become more competitive by producing  goods  that  are  of  a  high
         quality and standard.


     H.     Fiscal Policy


         The 2001 Budget  announced  a  change  in  fiscal  policy  from  an
         environment where the focus was on  reducing  the  deficit  to  one
         that decidedly  contributes  towards  economic  growth.  Continuing
         with the trend, the Budget for  2002  is  expected  to  announce  a
         further acceleration in  public  spending,  especially  on  capital
         infrastructure and provides room for  a  reduction  in  tax  rates,
         especially to low and  middle-income  workers.  This  more  growth-
         oriented fiscal policy is possible  because  of  a  healthy  fiscal
         position and declining debts service  costs.  The  Government  will
         continue to moderate its borrowing in order to reduce debt  service
         costs and interest rates in the long-term.


     I.     Medium Term Expenditure Framework


         In keeping  with  the  budget  theme  for  next  year  -  "Reducing
         Poverty,  Inequality  and  Vulnerability",  the  following  section
         outlines  how  departments  are  responding  to  the   government's
         priorities in the way in which the policies are  changing  and  the
         2002 budgets are being put together.
     J.     Restructuring national entities


         The  Committee  supports  the  additional   allocations   for   the
         restructuring of the SA Post  Office  over  the  MTEF  period,  but
         caution that it should become  self-sustainable  in  future,  while
         retaining  its  social  responsibilities  to  deliver  services  to
         previously underserved areas. The operational  losses  incurred  by
         the SA Post Office can in part be attributed to the failure of  the
         strategic  management  partner,  poor  financial   management   and
         corruption. Furthermore, the extension of  services  to  areas  not
         covered is not compromised.


         Another spending pressure on the MTEF arises from the  past  policy
         and administration of the UIF, which has resulted in  poor  funding
         mechanisms  to  deal  with  increased  levels  of  unemployment.  A
         turnaround strategy by the Department of  Labour  was  designed  to
         ensure that the  fund  becomes  sustainable  in  future.  Extending
         coverage to high-income earners  whose  contribution  will  cushion
         reserves, as they are less likely to  lose  their  jobs  and  claim
         unemployment benefits, will ensure this objective.  The  use  of  a
         sliding scale  for  paying  out  claims  will  also  help  in  this
         endeavour. In addition, funds are collected from all employers  who
         make deductions, and SARS is now responsible for  collections.  The
         collection and benefit of the fund has  furthermore  been  extended
         to farm and domestic workers, whose  sectors  are  more  vulnerable
         than  those  of  people  in  permanent  employment.  Installing   a
         computer-based database system should facilitate this turnaround.


     K.     Poverty alleviation


         The key objective identified in the MTBPS is  poverty  alleviation,
         to reduce the burden on the most  vulnerable  members  of  society.
         Social development  is  the  one  area  where  the  government  can
         directly attempt to eradicate poverty.  The  Department  of  Social
         Development  has  taken  a  step  towards  eradicating  poverty  by
         implementing a poverty relief programme. This programme will  focus
         on food, security, income  generation,  youth  development,  micro-
         financing and the integration of people with disabilities.  In  its
         contribution, this programme supports employment of more  women  in
         construction to generate income for their own  means  of  survival.
         From the Health Department's side, there is huge investment in  the
         school-feeding  programme  that  provides  nutrition  to  those  in
         poorer communities.


         The poverty relief  fund  provides  further  benefit  for  projects
         aimed at alleviating the plight of the  rural  poor,  women,  youth
         and  the  disabled.  Funding  of  R1,5  billion  is  available  for
         projects that address water resourcing, waste management,  creation
         of   infrastructure   and   protection    of    water    resources.
         Infrastructure  projects  under  way  include  créches,   community
         facilities,  access  roads,  community  gardens  and  water  supply
         projects.


     L.     Social services cluster


         The social services cluster forms the  backbone  of  the  MTEF,  as
         outlined in the MTBPS. The various departments in the cluster  have
         all  committed   themselves   to   undertake   an   institutionally
         integrated approach to increase  the  infrastructural  capacity  to
         deliver on social services through, in some instances, jointly  co-
         ordinated projects.


         "Education and training  are  long-term  investment  that  lay  the
         foundation for  an  improved  quality  of  life  through  increased
         skills and capabilities", conferring a positive externality in  the
         sense that the benefits spill over to  the  entire  population.  An
         educated labour force is much more innovative and can  bring  about
         technological advancement,  which  will  eventually  contribute  to
         growth.


         Within the social services cluster,  the  Department  of  Education
         has its emphasis on the following objectives:  Equity,  efficiency,
         quality and  accountability.  Priorities  include  HIV/AIDS,  Early
         Childhood  Development  (ECD),  and   school   effectiveness.   The
         department is specifically focusing  on  ECD,  since  they  believe
         that it  addresses  the  needs  of  the  poor.  The  allocation  of
         resources for early childhood development is particularly  welcomed
         by the FFC.


         A lack of investment on maintenance has  also  been  identified  in
         provincial education departments and the  number  of  schools  that
         needs repairs  still  remains  high.  The  national  Department  of
         Education has established a Directorate: Physical Planning to  look
         into the spending rates of various provinces.


     M.     Capacity problems


         One of the challenges facing the Department  of  Education  is  the
         lack of capacity to  convert  money  into  resources,  e.g.  buying
         learner support material or building classrooms. It is often  found
         that provinces do not know how to spend money in a timely and cost-
         effective  way.  This  problem  usually  exists  because  of   poor
         planning at management level.


         The  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  is  a  challenge  to  society  and   the
         government at large. The National Integrated  Plan  (NIP)  includes
         making resources available for  implementing  programmes  available
         to  the  Departments  of  Health,  of  Social  Development  and  of
         Education.  These  programmes  are  also  linked  to  the   poverty
         reduction strategy. The NIP is lead by  the  Department  of  Health
         and is aimed at spending money on prevention priorities,  expanding
         home-based care and community-based  care  programmes,  life-skills
         programming schools  and  voluntary  counselling  and  testing.  In
         respect of the Education Department, roll-overs  will  be  used  to
         pay HIV/AIDS officials that will be appointed to work  on  projects
         relating to HIV/AIDS.


         The FFC highly commends the additional allocation of resources  for
         the integrated strategy against HIV/AIDS -  R320  million  to  R422
         million for 2002-03 to R546 million for 2004 - to strengthen  home-
         and community-based care, and  support  voluntary  counselling  and
         testing and strength life-skills programmes  in  schools.  However,
         the FFC has reservations  about  including  this  as  part  of  the
         equitable share because  HIV/AIDS  and  other  diseases  associated
         with it may be covered in the PHC sector budgets.


          The child support grant has been extended to reach  three  million
         beneficiaries by the end of  2002-03.  Despite  available  funding,
         problems persist.  eg  children  not  being  supported  because  of
         foster  parents  misusing  the  money.  This  leaves   the   Social
         Development Department to work  together  with  the  Department  of
         Home Affairs to make sure that applicants have  the  necessary  and
         valid identity documents and birth  certificates  when  they  apply
         for grants. This departmental co-operation can also  speed  up  the
         application processes.


         Even though additional  resources  have  been  made  available  for
         increases in the child support grant  and  other  grants,  the  FFC
         fears that the budgeted values - 2 000 values  were  used  -  would
         underestimate the demand placed on  these  grants,  especially  the
         foster care grant.


         On the housing front, the change in focus from quantity to  quality
         of housing has slowed down the delivery process. In  addition,  the
         department needs  to  develop  a  proper  planning  and  relocation
         approach, as well as focus on the integrated rural development  and
         urban renewal plans for future developments.


     N.     Co-ordination between departments


         In the administration services  cluster,  the  Department  of  Home
         Affairs  has  placed  itself  in  a  position  to  facilitate   the
         integration of all departments - Health, Police, etc,  as  well  as
         the Department of Labour (UIF), to  ensure  effective  delivery  of
         services and to  enable  access  to  pension  funds,  the  UIF  and
         welfare grants. The proper financial management system should be  a
         priority for the department, i.e. a  system  to  give  all  details
         about an individual when applying for grants,  identity  documents,
         UIF, etc.


         With  the  inheritance  of   infrastructure   backlogs   especially
         prevalent in housing, health  and  education,  the  government  has
         undertaken to  increase  spending  on  infrastructure  maintenance,
         rehabilitation,  and  on  construction  to  provide  the  necessary
         microeconomic framework, complementing  the  already  macroeconomic
         achievements, to bring about an  integrated  departmental  approach
         to sustain and support the delivery of public services.


     O.     Protection services cluster


         The objective of an integrated justice system,  comprising  police,
         justice,  correctional  services  and  defence,   is   pivotal   in
         stabilising crime levels  and  promoting  growth  in  the  country.
         Evidence presented to the  Committee  attested  to  the  fact  that
         integration of policy priorities  and  budgetary  allocation  is  a
         crucial  factor  within  this  cluster.  In  order  to  "strengthen
         capacity in the safety and  security  sector  and  to  prevent  and
         combat crime the budgetary allocation will grow  by  7,2  per  cent
         annually over the medium term". The  Committee  noted  that  a  key
         part of the hearings was devoted to personnel issues  and  salaries
         across the cluster.


     P.     Skills development and job creation


         One of the key issues for the Department of Labour  is  sustainable
         job creation in accordance with the job summit  commitments  agreed
         to in  1999,  through  special  employment  programmes,  integrated
         provincial projects,  sectoral  job  creation  and  human  resource
         development.  The  skills  development  levy  is  largely  used  to
         achieve this objective.


         In addition, the department aims to instil ordinary  citizens  with
         the necessary skills required in the job market. Another  challenge
         for the department is the training of people for these  programmes,
         especially in rural areas.


     Q.     Division of revenue


         The Committee considered a  report  on  the  vertical  transfer  of
         funds from  national  to  provincial  and  local  governments.  The
         spending priorities of the government, with respect  to  provincial
         and local government, encompasses social services spending  on  the
         provincial side and  the  provision  of  basic  services  to  local
         government.  In  line  with  this,  the  government  adjusted   the
         vertical share of the spheres of government to enable execution  of
         these priorities. In order to achieve equity,  revenue  is  divided
         horizontally by means of  unconditional  grants  (equitable  share)
         and  conditional  grants.  In  addition,  local  governments   have
         undergone  major  restructuring,  in  order  to  deliver  efficient
         services,  and  some  of  this  cost  burden  is  being  met   from
         nationally raised revenue.
         Some concerns raised by the Committee includes the fact that  these
         grants may not be sufficient to address  the  challenges  ahead  of
         local government, where  people  can  experience  direct  benefits.
         Some thought needs to  given  to  increasing  their  share  of  the
         equitable grant. Whereas a previous concern was the flow  of  funds
         to local governments, the challenge currently is the  underspending
         of funds. Second is the lack of capacity that still  exists  within
         some  departments  to  spend  allocated  funds.  In  addition,  the
         Committee was of the opinion that the mindset of local  governments
         should be  changed  to  include  three-year  budgets  and  spending
         priorities in order to ensure sustainable spending, providing  that
         the necessary spending capacity is available. This, in  turn,  will
         lead  to   the   improvement   in   and   increase   of   municipal
         infrastructure, in line with government priorities.  In  addressing
         the capacity problem, more information needs to be provided to  the
         National Treasury on spending measures in order to  have  proactive
         strategies to deal with underspending, as this could lead  to  lack
         of growth and non-delivery of services,  in  direct  opposition  to
         government priorities. More co-operation between different  spheres
         of government will ensure that local governments take ownership  of
         functions  assigned  to  them,  for  instance  to  make  sure  that
         affordable service charges accompany provision of low-cost  housing
         by the national government to  the  lower-income  groups.  Finally,
         the Committee is of the opinion  that  the  rural  development  and
         urban  renewal  strategies  should   be   vigorously   pursued   by
         provincial and local governments  through  co-operative  governance
         and a sound infrastructure planning.


         Provinces and municipalities are the  service  delivery  agents  of
         the government, and it is all  the  more  important  that  they  be
         capacitated to adjust their spending priorities to be in line  with
         those of the national government. Whereas  provinces  receive  most
         income (95%) through national transfers, i.e. the  equitable  share
         and various unconditional grants, municipalities have  the  ability
         to generate up to 90% of their own revenue. This  capacity  depends
         on their respective tax bases, and varies for Category A, B  and  C
         municipalities. Some financial  assistance  is  thus  required  for
         local government  in  particular,  where  major  restructuring  has
         taken place with the  amalgamation  of  284  local  governments  in
         order to meet spending priorities. This was done with  the  aim  of
         delivering   more   efficient   and   effective   services   across
         boundaries, particularly to areas  lacking  in  infrastructure  and
         service  delivery.  The  provision  of  services  to   communities,
         promoting  social  and  economic  development  and   infrastructure
         development, should be done in a sustainable way, and also  involve
         the community organisations.  Due  to  varying  tax  bases  between
         municipalities resulting in lack of  capacity,  there  is  often  a
         tendency for some  municipalities  to  be  unable  to  spend  their
         funds. It  therefore  becomes  important  for  provincial  and  the
         national government to intervene and support the  local  government
         to address service backlogs and improve service delivery. Once  all
         these structures are in place, municipal managers  should  then  be
         held  accountable  for  non-delivery  of   services,   arrears   in
         payments, deficits, corruption and non-reporting of information.


         The  other  way  of  improving  service  delivery  and  eradicating
         poverty  is  PPPs,  whereby  the  public  departments  are  joining
         together to increase the capacity and  skill  transfer  to  explore
         the  necessary  opportunities  and  improve   infrastructure.   The
         Department of Provincial and Local  Government  is  overseeing  the
         implemention  of  the  Integrated  Development  Plans   (IDPs)   in
         municipalities to direct resources towards key  policy  priorities.
         Furthermore,  the  effective  implementation  of   the   Integrated
         Sustainable  Rural  Development  Programme  (ISRDS)  uses  existing
         funding to focus on  improving  service  delivery  in  co-ordinated
         manner.


     R.     Minister of Finance's response to inputs of Committee


         1. General observations on inputs


              (a) Most input were supportive of the  growth-oriented  budget
                  statement.


              (b) Some people argue for faster growth and  others  for  less
                  borrowing and tax cuts.


              (c) The 2002 budget provides a balance that will contribute to
                  strong growth in  respect  of  infrastructure  and  social
                  services, as well as  tax  relief,  mainly  for  low-  and
                  middle-income workers.
         2. Current economy


              Although the global economic slowdown will affect  our  growth
              negatively, we are  still  projected  to  post  positive  real
              growth in the economy, due to:


              *   Strong fiscal position provides room for fiscal policy  as
                  a growth stimulant.


              *   The export sector is performing well, due to a competitive
                  currency.


              *   Inflation is on a downward trend, and we have not  had  to
                  hike interest rates or run up foreign liabilities, as  was
                  the case in 1998.


         3. Fiscal policy


              (a) The fiscal  framework  makes  provision  for  strong  real
                  growth in spending next year.


              (b) The frameworks create  room  for  tax  cuts  to  stimulate
                  expenditure on consumption.


              (c) Limitations to  borrowing  and  low  interest  rates  will
                  render growth in spending more sustainable.


              (d) PPPs and  regulatory  reform  can  be  used  to  stimulate
                  capital investment and job creation.


              (e) An increase in the deficit to 2,6% is projected.


         4. Tax policy


              (a) No major tax reforms in 2002.


              (b) Tax cuts will aim  to  stimulate  consumer  demand,  lower
                  employment  cost,   improved   overall   progression   and
                  fairness of the tax system.


              (c) During 2002, the government will  review  retirement  fund
                  taxes, public benefit organisations and  specific  sectors
                  where the effective rate is low.


         5. Spending framework


              (a) Top priority in 2002 will be given  to  reducing  poverty,
                  inequality and vulnerability.


              (b)  Other  priorities  are  increased  spending   on   health
                  services,    social    grants,     municipal     services,
                  infrastructure,  policing  and  administration   services,
                  strengthening of programmes and tackling HIV/AIDS.
              (c) The government must improve the quality of spending.


              (d) A situation of underspending  is  improving  signalled  by
                  government capital formation grew in  the  first  half  of
                  2001, the size of roll-overs is declining and  conditional
                  grant mechanisms are changed to aid spending.


         6. Intergovernmental finances


              (a) Growth in local government share caters for the  extension
                  of services to those at  present  excluded,  provision  of
                  free basic services and covering costs  of  governance  in
                  fiscally weak municipalities.


              (b) The transformation of local government should improve  the
                  level of efficiency and quality of services to the poor.


              (c) The provincial share rises to accommodate the social grant
                  take-up  and   inflation-related   increase   in   grants,
                  programmes to fight HIV/AIDS,  early  childhood  education
                  and acceleration of spending on infrastructure.


                  The Minister said that "hearings conducted in  the  Budget
                  Committee are a very positive development and that  inputs
                  and comments made will be factored into the 2002 Budget".


     S.     Comments and recommendations


         1.  The  Committee  supports  the  theme  of  the  2002  budget  of
              addressing poverty and vulnerability.  The  Committee  further
              agrees  with  major  priorities  of  the  government  and  the
              expansionary fiscal policy as  projected  over  the  MTEF.  It
              proposes to release funds to deal  with  the  social  problems
              affecting  the  poor,  while  at  the  same  time  stimulating
              economic growth and job creation over the medium to long term.


         2. The Committee is concerned with the lack of  capacity  to  spend
              in some areas of spending where services are delivered.  While
              there are improvements, the government must  put  measures  in
              place to deal with these urgently.  Committees  of  Parliament
              must play a role in monitoring this. Committees of the various
              legislatures  must  also,  scrutinise  and   monitor   monthly
              expenditure figures released by the Treasury on  a  continuous
              basis and hold departments accountable in accordance with  the
              PFMA. This should limit the  roll-over  of  funds  and  reduce
              underspending.


         3. The Committee is concerned  with  the  levels  of  co-ordination
              between government departments, despite the  cluster  approach
              of ministries at national  level.  This  is  more  visible  in
              government capital projects, with  the  resultant  roll-overs.
              The Committee  therefore  recommends  the  intensification  of
              better co-ordination at all levels, better  planing  at  local
              level and the utilisation of PPPs to enhance delivery, provide
              skills and expertise, where necessary. However, there needs to
              be proper regulation of these PPPs in order to avert  problems
              similar to those experienced with in some areas.


         4. The lack  of  financial  services  in  the  rural  areas  is  of
              concern, as such services are crucial for  rural  development.
              Possible mechanisms  for  financial  services  to  reach  poor
              areas, via The Post Bank, is one option in respect of  such  a
              service. The government,  via  the  Department  of  Trade  and
              Industry, is urged to explore  increased  spending  on  small,
              medium and micro enterprises.


         5. Effective  co-ordination  for  maintenance   and  infrastructure
              between Department of Public Works and orther  departments  is
              necessary for maintenance and the roll-out  of  capital  works
              programmes of government.


         6.  There  is  a  need  to  strenghtened  the  capacity  of   local
              government in order  to  carry  out  its  mandate  to  deliver
              services.


         7. The Committee recommends that in future departments should  make
              presentations to the committee as clusters to further  improve
              co-ordination between departments.


     T.     Conclusion


         The Committee would like to thank all  participants  in  the  MTBPS
         hearings, as this will assist Parliament in its oversight role  and
         further contribute to the budget process.
