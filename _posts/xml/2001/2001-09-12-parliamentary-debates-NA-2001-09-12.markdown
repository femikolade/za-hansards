                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms M M SOTYU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a notorious gang leader killed  himself,  and  five  other  gang
           members handed themselves to the police in Guguletu; and


       (b)  the arrest of these gangsters who have been terrorising ordinary
           people is a result of co-operation between the  police  and  the
           community;


  (2) believes that productive co-operation  between  communities  and  the
       police will go a long way in fighting crime; and


  (3) commends the community of Guguletu for co-operating with  the  police
       in bringing perpetrators of criminal actions to book.

[Applause.]

Mr D K MALULEKE: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -
  (1) requests the  PAC,  if  they  have  any  evidence  to  support  their
       statements that farm killings  are  politically  motivated,  to  come
       forward with it;


  (2) is of the opinion that the police should interview Mr Enoch  Zulu  to
       substantiate his statement about farm attacks and that he must appear
       before the investigating team currently looking at  farm  attacks  to
       test the authenticity and accuracy of his statements; and


  (3) recognises that land and land reform is a very  sensitive  issue  and
       should be treated with the utmost care and consideration, and that it
       would be tragically irresponsible for any political party or  NGO  to
       make statements which they cannot back up with hard evidence, because
       this could lead to possible incitement and that  is  the  last  thing
       South Africa needs right now.

Dr O BALOYI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern and regret the extensive  damage  to  property  as
       well as loss of life caused  by  extensive  veld  fires  in  Northern
       KwaZulu-Natal as well as Vrede in the Free State; and


  (2) urges the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism to set up a
       committee to consult with the people who have lost property in  order
       to ascertain the possibility of compensation in the  same  manner  as
       the process followed by the committee that  handled  the  fires  that
       broke out in the Kruger National Park.

Mr A R AINSLIE: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that the ANC Youth League and  the  Free  State  Young  Farmers'
           Association  had  a  very  successful   meeting   yesterday   in
           Bloemfontein to discuss the formation on a bilateral  structure;
           and


       (b)  that the meeting discussed the  training  of  aspiring  farmers,
           opening up of the market, racism, exploitation and affordability
           of farms;


  (2) welcomes the initiative of these young people who showed much- needed
       maturity in opting for intelligible dialogue instead of shouting from
       the fringes; and


  (3) calls on all South Africans in all sectors to follow their lead,  and
       to unite around the common objective of creating a  better  life  for
       all our people.
[Applause.]

Adv A H GAUM: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its great concern at the  number  of  bomb  scares  in  and
       around Cape Town in the last couple of hours;


  (2) commends the rapid response  of  the  SAPS  in  acting  speedily  and
       appropriately, and requests the urgent  action  of  the  Minister  of
       Safety and Security in this regard; and


  (3) following the terrorist attacks in the United States and  the  scares
       in Cape Town, requests the Minister of Safety and Security  to  place
       the police services on full alert in this province.

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with appreciation the proactive and positive  initiative  taken
       by the Commonwealth Ministerial Committee and subsequently leaders of
       SADC countries to pressurise President  Robert  Mugabe  to  halt  and
       refrain from further farm invasions and occupations in Zimbabwe;


  (2) further notes that South Africans have given the Government  a  clear
       mandate  to  restitute  and  distribute  land  by  means  of  orderly
       enforcement of the rule of law which is guaranteed and  enshrined  in
       the RSA Constitution;


  (3)  urges  the  Government  to  expedite  the   land   restitution   and
       distribution programme and not to heed  the  call  for  illegal  land
       invasions and land grabbing; and


  (4) calls on the Government, all political organisations and  all  peace-
       loving South Africans to avoid the promotion of racial  tensions  and
       animosity in this country by way of inciting people on the ground  to
       kill farmers in order to invade and grab land, but instead to support
       the orderly and equitable distribution of land and to  look  for  the
       future in the future rather than looking for the future in the past.

Mr L T LANDERS: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the DA has been embroiled in deepening tensions  and  divisions,
           resulting in the purging of Peter Marais; and


       (b)  these divisions are along racial lines;


  (2) believes that the recent tensions confirm our long-held  belief  that
       the DA has mainly been about the swallowing in of the New NP  by  the
       DP in order to defend white interests and privileges; and


  (3) calls upon all patriots who are committed to change to join  the  ANC
       to work towards a united South African nation and a better  life  for
       all.

[Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the PAC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes with shock the bomb blast in New York and  Washington  and  the
       killing of many innocent people;


  (2) calls on the USA to exercise  restraint  and  not  go  the  route  of
       retaliation as many more people may die; and


  (3) appeals to the USA and the UN to encourage the world to go the  route
       of the International Conference against Racism in Durban, as this  is
       the only way the world can discuss and resolve conflict  and  attempt
       to move  together  to  ensure  peace  for  all  the  people  and  for
       posterity.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the implementation of the reception of five  to  six-year-
       olds with effect from next year in all  primary  education  providers
       will bring in an additional one million learners to our schools;


  (2) prevails upon provincial education departments to have the  necessary
       capacity and resources to cater for the needs of these young ones;


  (3)  believes  that  whatever  ideas  education  authorities  have   been
       entertaining about retrenching teachers, should be kept  in  abeyance
       in order to cope with the avalanche of beginners; and


  (4) commends the Ministry of  Education  for  implementing  the  Grade  R
       admissions across the board as this will enhance the school readiness
       of such children.

Mr F T MASERUMULE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  taxi operators from all provinces in South Africa will  meet  in
           Durban to launch a national taxi association; and


       (b)   this  new  taxi  association  will  be  composed  of  all  taxi
           organisations;


  (2) believes that this move will enable  taxi  operators  to  talk  as  a
       united voice in matters relating to transport policy formulation  and
       implementation; and


  (3) wishes representatives of all taxi associations good  luck  in  their
       deliberations  over  the  weekend  to  form  a  new   national   taxi
       association.

[Applause.]

Mr N J CLELLAND: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Umsobomvu Fund, a youth job creation scheme,  was  announced
           in 1998, yielding a total of  R855  million  which  after  three
           years of inaction now sits at R900 million;


       (b)  to this day it has not disbursed a single cent to stimulate  job
           creation or develop skills amongst the youth; and


       (c)   the  Minister  of  Labour  has  suddenly  announced  that   his
           department will now be responsible for running the fund and that
           it would speed up the work of the fund; and


  (2) calls on the Minister to -


       (a)  explain the inactivity of the fund since 1998, bearing  in  mind
           that his department has been a permanent member of the board  of
           the Umsobomvu Fund; and


       (b)  stop the delays and get on with the real task of  creating  jobs
           for our youth.

[Applause.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that draft regulations for labelling  of  genetically  modified
       foods indicate that -


       (a)  a large costly bureaucracy  will  be  required  to  monitor  the
           proposed regulations;
       (b)  the cost of food will increase significantly as a result;


       (c)  animals fed on genetically modified foods are  not  included  in
           the labelling net;


       (d)  a label stating ``no GM food'' implies less than 1% of  GM  food
           which  is  in  fact  misleading  as  a  ``GM-free''   label   is
           disallowed; and


       (e)  the wording of  the  regulation  is  complex  and  difficult  to
           understand; and


  (2) calls on the Minister to review her approach to these regulations and
       adopt simpler and clearer measures.

Mr M R BALOYI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the stance by Israel and Palestine to press  ahead  with  peace
       talks despite the violence engulfing the region;


  (2) believes that  negotiations  remain  an  important  vehicle  for  the
       peaceful resolution of the crisis in the Middle East;


  (3) applauds the decision by  both  leaders,  Yasser  Arafat  and  Shimon
       Peres, to press ahead with peace negotiations; and


  (4) calls on the people in  the  region  to  support  initiatives  for  a
       peaceful resolution of the conflict in that region.

[Applause.]

Mr C M MORKEL: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House notes -


  (1) the recent statement by ANC Youth League President, Malusi Gigaba, to
       the effect that there is ``a vacuum in the leadership''  of  an  ANC-
       SACP-Cosatu  alliance  in  ``crisis'',  that  the  ANC's   tripartite
       alliance is, by this admission, not fit to  govern  itself  or  South
       Africa; and


  (2) urges the ANC to settle its socioeconomically  destructive  squabbles
       around Gear, privatisation and  elitist  black  economic  empowerment
       strategies, so that  investor  confidence  and  productivity  can  be
       boosted to create business  opportunities  and  jobs  for  all  South
       Africans, especially the youth.

Mr M E MABETA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with shock the death of a young man  during  looting  that  took
           place in KwaNobuhle, during  which  foreign  shop-owners  and  a
           local mosque were targeted; and


       (b)  with alarm the hundreds  of  apparently  xenophobic  looters  in
           Uitenhage that caused millions of rands of damage;


  (2) calls upon the Department  of  Safety  and  Security  immediately  to
       investigate and punish those Eastern Cape police  officers  who  were
       reported to have stood by and watched as the looting took place; and


  (3) calls upon the Government urgently to assist and extend protection to
       all its citizens, irrespective of their origin, religious affiliation
       or any other form of classification.

Mr B M SOLO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that seven people were killed and seven others injured in a bus
       accident at Qumbu yesterday;


  (2) expresses its condolences to the families of the deceased;


  (3) wishes the injured a speedy recovery; and


  (4) calls upon all  South  Africans  to  comply  with  the  Arrive  Alive
       campaign.

[Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: I shall move on behalf ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Dudley, I have not yet called  you  or  your  party.
The DP! The IFP! It seems all parties have run out  of  notices  of  motion.
The ACDP!

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  despite assurances from the government of Sudan that they  would
           cease air attacks against the South, the National Islamic  Front
           government continues to unleash waves of artillery  bombardments
           and ground assaults  against  Christian  villages  in  the  Nuba
           Mountains; and


       (b)  many villages have been burned and many people have been  killed
           by the Sudanese government forces and communities, churches  and
           schools are under attack and in the gravest danger; and
  (2) calls on the Government to speak out against these atrocities and put
       pressure on the government of Sudan to stop waging  war  against  its
       own citizens.

  TERRORISM ATTACKS ON WORLD TRADE CENTRE AND PENTAGON IN THE UNITED STATES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M T GONIWE: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Chief Whip  of  the  Majority
Party, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) noting -


       (a)  the indefensible and dastardly attacks yesterday  on  the  World
           Trade Centre in New York and on the  Pentagon,  headquarters  of
           the Department of Defence of the United States; and


       (b)  that these cowardly acts of terrorism resulted in  unprecedented
           levels of death and destruction to the American people;


  (2) condemns these acts of terrorism against the people of America in the
       same way that it condemns terrorism anywhere in the world; and

       loved ones, as well as to the government of the United States.

  That the House -


  (1) notes that numerous festivities such as the 10-day repentance, Day of
       Atonement, Sukkot and Shemini Azeret are to be celebrated by those of
       the Jewish faith between the Jewish New Year on 18 September 2001 and

       occasions the very best.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the  hon  Mr  Gaoretelelwe  Baloi  has  been  absent  from
       Parliament for the past four months owing to illness and  sympathises
       with him;


  (2) remembers him and his family as he recuperates at  home  after  being
       discharged from hospital; and


  (3) prays for him so that he is relieved of the agony that  he  has  been
       going through since becoming ill.

Agreed to.

                               POINT OF ORDER

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, on a point of  order:  When  the  hon  the
Chief Whip of the Majority Party actually moved the motion  without  notice,
which was agreed to by all parties,  the  last  paragraph  was  also  agreed
upon, but for one reason or another, if I  listened  correctly  to  the  hon
member, he left out the last paragraph. In other words, the motion  was  not
moved on the same grounds that it was agreed upon by the parties.
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I regret to say you are reopening a matter  which
the House has agreed on. When I asked whether  there  were  any  objections,
there were none, and the motion was agreed to. Therefore,  that  closes  the
matter and the business for the day.

The House adjourned at 17:24.
