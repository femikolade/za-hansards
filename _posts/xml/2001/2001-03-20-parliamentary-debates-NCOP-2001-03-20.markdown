                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek by die volgende sitting
van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad die Regering se poging om gelykheid met indiensneming in die
  onderwys te bewerkstellig, sal bespreek, veral gesien in die lig van die
  Gautengse Onderwysdepartement se besluit om die Primêre Skool Oliver
  Lodge in Vanderbijlpark met 96% swart leerlinge te dwing om onderwysers
  van hulle
  keuse nie aan te stel nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting of the
Council I shall move:


  That the attempt by the Government to effect employment equity in
  education be discussed, especially in the light of the Gauteng Education
  Department's decision to force the Primary School Oliver Lodge in
  Vanderbijlpark, with 96% black learners, not to appoint the teachers of
  their choice.]

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  apartheid was declared a crime against humanity;


       (b)  despite the fact that South African now has a nonsexist,
           nonracial, democratic Constitution, there are disturbing signs
           that racism still persists in our society;


       (c)  the lack of education and health for the vast majority of South
           Africans is a direct result of the structured and
           institutionalised racial oppression of the past;


       (d)  poverty has given rise to illiteracy, to a high incidence of
           pandemics such as HIV/Aids, tuberculosis, cholera and malaria,
           and to the general marginalisation of our people ...

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Madam Chairperson, there appears to be a
misunderstanding. This is a motion that will be put to the House at a later
stage at the end of the debate.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! So that is not notice of a motion. That
is a motion that will be put to the House later as a substantive motion.

                         RECENT CRICKET ACHIEVEMENTS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes that the Republic of South Africa is one of the world's great
       sports-loving nations, and wishes to acknowledge two great acts of
       sporting prowess in the game of cricket in recent weeks, namely -


       (a)  the sparkling and faultless batting of Indian batsman VVS
           Larman, when he scored 281 runs after flaying the much-vaunted
           bowling attack of Messrs Glen McGrath and Shane Warne in the
           second test between Australia and India at the 90 000 capacity
           Eden Gardens in Calcutta; and


       (b)  the equally formidable feat of West Indies pace bowler Courtney
           Walsh, who is the first player to reach the milestone of 500
           wickets in test cricket;


  (2) notes that cricket lovers the world over welcome these epoch-making
       feats for having undoubtedly helped elevate the glorious game of
       cricket, with its unmatched potential for excitement and
       entertainment, from the doldrums of shame and despair of the match-
       fixing scandals that had recently tarnished its image; and
  (3) applauds and congratulates these fine international cricketers for
       their wholesome contributions to this unique game of universal
       acclaim.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                   GREATER ACCESSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr J HORNE: Mev die Voorsitter, ek stel voor sonder kennisgewing:


 Dat die Raad die voorneme van President Mbeki om in die toekoms meer
 sigbaar in die land te wees, in besonder op grondvlak, asook om 'n oopdeur-
 administrasie te handhaaf om sodoende toeganklik vir almal te wees,
 ondersteun.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council supports President Mbeki's intention in future to be
  more visible in the country, especially at grass-roots level, and to
  maintain an open door administration, so as to be accessible to
  everyone.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                   FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION IN MPUMALANGA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes a report in the  Mail & Guardian which highlights the success
       of the anticorruption hotline that was established in the Office of
       the Premier of Mpumalanga;


  (2) also notes that in terms of this report the Mpumalanga Government's
       labour relations department had hired qualified attorneys and
       magistrates to fast-track internal disciplinary hearings against
       officials;


  (3) further notes that since January, 32 officials have already been
       dismissed while another 7 were suspended without pay;


  (4) believes that these initiatives show the commitment of the provincial
       government to fight corruption and other behaviour which is
       detrimental to the effective delivery of services to our people; and


  (5) commends the provincial government on its initiative.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      RACIST ASSAULT OF MS SYLVIA MANDA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -
  (1) expresses its shock and disapproval in the strongest language at the
       behaviour of the police officers who allegedly assaulted and arrested
       Ms Sylvia Manda on the grounds of her complexion, facial appearance,
       accent and style of dressing;


  (2) notes with serious concern that Ms Manda was harassed, assaulted and
       finally arrested in front of her school-children;


  (3) strongly condemns all forms of discrimination against black women in
       this country; and


  (4) urges the Government to empower and equip the SAPS to fulfil their
       constitutional duty to protect and secure the inhabitants of South
       Africa, including the very dark women.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      PRONOUNCEMENTS BY PREMIER STOFILE

                             (Draft Resolution)
Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the statement by Premier Stofile of the Eastern Cape in
       which he declares that provincial powers must be devolved to local
       government, the provincial executive be slimmed down ...

I do not know if he is referring to anything in particular there-


  ... the electoral system be changed, by which half the members of the
  legislature will be elected and half come from a party list, and that
  members of the legislatures get out into the field instead of seeking to
  get into Hansard;


  (2) in the light of the above statement requests the Minister of
       Provincial and Local Government to inform the National Council of
       Provinces whether these suggestions are an expression of decisions
       which we are not yet party to, or merely a declaration of provincial
       independence by the honourable Premier Stofile.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to the motion?
[Interjections.] There is an objection. The motion therefore becomes notice
of a motion.

              FIRST ARTIFICIAL HEART TRANSPLANT IN SOUTH AFRICA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, ek stel voor sonder kennisgewing:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van Suid-Afrika se eerste kunshartoorplanting wat met
       sukses deur 'n span Suid-Afrikaanse dokters in die City Park-
       hospitaal in Kaapstad uitgevoer is en weer eens bewys het dat Suid-
       Afrikaanse dokters vergelyk kan word met die bestes in die wêreld;


  (2) hierdie span dokters van harte gelukwens met hierdie wonderlike
       prestasie waarop elke Suid-Afrikaner opreg trots kan wees; en


  (3) die Minister van Gesondheid versoek om alles in haar vermoë te doen
       om 'n gunstige klimaat vir hierdie en ander Suid-Afrikaanse dokters
       te probeer skep, om te verhoed dat hulle ons mooi land, waar ons
       hulle so nodig het, verlaat.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that South Africa's first artificial heart transplant was
       successfully performed by a team of South African doctors in the City
       Park Hospital in Cape Town, and that this is renewed proof that South
       African doctors can be compared to the best in the world;


  (2) sincerely congratulates this team of doctors on their wonderful
       achievement of which every South African can justifiably be proud;
       and


  (3) requests the Minister of Health to do everything in her power to try
       to create a favourable climate for these and other South African
       doctors, to prevent them from leaving our beautiful country, which
       needs them so much.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                   ARMED ROBBERY ATTEMPT IN PORT ELIZABETH

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mes E C GOUWS: Mev die Voorsitter, ek stel voor sonder kennisgewing:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die geweldskultuur wat in die land aan die voortsnel
       is;
  (2) ook kennis neem dat op Sondag 18 Maart onskuldige besoekers aan 'n
       winkelsentrum in die eens rustige Port Elizabeth letterlik vir hul
       lewens moes vlug voor die koeëlreën van rowers gewapen met drie
       pistole, 'n rewolwer en 'n R5-geweer;


  (3) die polisie lof toeswaai vir hul besonder vinnige en doeltreffende
       optrede tydens die brutale gewapende roofpoging. Twee lede van die
       mag het met vreeslose taakgerigtheid opgetree en eiehandig die swaar
       gewapende rowers aangedurf en sodoende verhoed dat daar 'n
       grootskaalse bloedbad gevolg het; en


  (4) sy hartlike dank en gelukwense oordra aan elke polisielid,
       reddingswerker en lid van die publiek wat in die drama kopgehou het
       en kalm gebly het.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Ms E C GOUWS: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the culture of violence in the country, which is progressing
       rapidly;
  (2) further notes that on Sunday 18 March innocent people in a shopping
       centre in the once peaceful Port Elizabeth literally had to flee for
       their lives in the face of a rain of bullets from robbers armed with
       three pistols, a revolver and an R5 rifle;


  (3) commends the police for their particularly rapid and effective action
       during the brutal armed robbery attempt, in which two members of the
       police acted fearlessly and purposefully and single-handedly tackled
       the heavily armed robbers, thereby preventing a full-scale bloodbath
       from happening; and


  (4) conveys its sincere gratitude and congratulations to each police
       officer, rescue worker and member of the public who kept their heads
       and stayed calm during the drama.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       ANTIDISCRIMINATION RADIO BROADCAST ``VOICES WITHOUT FRONTIERS''

                             (Draft Resolution)

Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that Johannesburg will be the international hub for the March
       21 antidiscrimination radio broadcast, ``Voices Without Frontiers'',
       which will be broadcast live by community radio stations around the
       world;


  (2) notes that the 24-hour broadcast will be fed live from Johannesburg
       for 10 hours (9 am to 7 pm) and that the other 14 hours will be fed
       from Montreal and Vienna;


  (3) further notes that the focus issues of this broadcast will be -


       (a)  discrimination on the basis of race, gender, disability,
           ethnicity;


       (b)  human rights abuses; and


       (c)  discrimination against refugees and other migrant people; and


  (4) acknowledges the commitment of ``Voices Without Frontiers'' in the
       commendable role they have played by uniting more than 25 languages
       in our fight against discrimination on the basis of race, gender,
       disability and ethnicity.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

             ALLOCATION OF BUDGET FOR THE YOUTH IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the amount of R5,5 million allocated to Emandleni
       Camp, which is associated with the IFP, and that this amounts to
       84,6% of the total budget for the youth;
  (2) further notes that no one has ever seen its curriculum, its intake
       policy or the average age of trainees or its output;


  (3) further notes that this skewed distribution of financial resources
       will tarnish the good financial record of KwaZulu-Natal's Department
       of Finance;


  (4) notes with sadness the lack of sensitivity regarding other youth
       programmes in the rest of the province, namely the Midlands and the
       southern part of KwaZulu-Natal.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to that motion?
[Interjections.] There is an objection and the motion therefore becomes
notice of a motion.

                   USE OF RUGBY FIELDS FOR SOCCER MATCHES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D M KGWARE: Madam Chairperson, I move without notice ...
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mrs Versveld, could we have order
please? Proceed, Mr Kgware.

Mr D M KGWARE: Madam Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) commends the initiative of the Natal Rugby Union for inviting two
       soccer clubs, Amazulu and Golden Arrows, to play a soccer game before
       the rugby match started;


  (2) notes that this initiative contributes to attempts at reconciliation
       in our country;


  (3) further notes that this is contrary to what happened at the Newlands
       sports field in the Western Cape where soccer was expelled by the
       City of Cape Town because of complaints from Newlands residents about
       the noise level of approximately 20 000 soccer supporters, compared
       to that of approximately 120 000 rugby supporters; and


  (4) calls upon the City of Cape Town to play a leading role in
       reconciliation so that incidents of this nature do not happen again
       in the province.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to that motion?
[Interjections.] There is an objection. The motion will therefore become
notice of a motion. Could I ask members to follow the usual practice of
rising if there is an objection, and not signalling from their seats. I
would appreciate that. Sometimes I cannot see members.

                      RACIST ATTACK AT SHOPPING CENTRE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with shock the brutal assault on a black female shopper by a
       white man;


  (2) further notes that the attack, which was totally unprovoked, was
       spurred by the deep-seated racism that is still harboured by some
       elements within the white community;


  (3) expresses its disappointment that the management of the specific
       shopping mall felt it necessary to release the attacker, despite the
       severity of the wound sustained by the victim; and


  (4) calls on the police to investigate why the shopping mall management
       did not wait for the arrival of the police to arrest this racist
       perpetrator before they released him.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  CONFERRING OF HONORARY MEMBERSHIP OF SA ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN GRADUATES ON
                                 MRS PANDOR

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M E SURTY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes that a resolution, in respect of the Chairperson of the
       Council, was adopted at the Annual General Meeting of the South
       African Association of Women Graduates (SAAWG), held at the
       University of Cape Town on 4 February 2001;


  (2) also notes that this resolution, drawn up by the committee of the
       Cape Town Branch of the SAAWG, was approved unanimously by the
       members of the Branch who were present at a Branch meeting held in
       Pinelands, Cape Town, on 21 October 2000, and that it was then
       forwarded to the National Executive of the SAAWG for inclusion in the
       agenda for the National Annual General Meeting on 4 February 2001;


  (3) further notes that at that meeting the resolution gained the
       unanimous approval of all present, and that the SAAWG has thus
       invited Mrs Naledi Pandor to accept Honorary Membership of the
       Association;


  (4) takes note that the wording of the resolution reads:


       The South African Association of Women Graduates is resolved that Mrs
       Naledi Pandor, who has been an Ordinary Member in good standing for
       many years, should be given the status of Honorary Member by virtue
       of her contributions to higher education in general and the education
       of women in particular, as well as the important role she now plays
       in public life.


       Motivation:


       Mrs Pandor, who holds a BA degree in English and History and a
       Certificate of Education from the Universities of Botswana and
       Swaziland, MA in Education from London University and MA in
       Linguistics from the University of Stellenbosch, has always had a
       special interest in education issues. She lectured at the University
       of Bophuthatswana and then at the University of Cape Town, where she
       was Assistant Director of the Academic Support Programme (now
       Academic Development Programme) which has as one of its main
       objectives the development of academic literacy in students from
       previously disadvantaged backgrounds. After South Africa's first
       democratic elections in 1994 she entered Parliament, where she served
       on several portfolio committees, most notably as convenor of the
       subcommittee on higher education in the Education Portfolio
       Committee. In June 1999 she was elected Chairperson of the National
       Council of Provinces. Her interest in higher education has
       nevertheless continued, and in April 2000 she became Chancellor of
       the Cape Technikon, having previously served with distinction on the
       Council of the institution.


       With these significant achievements in both the educational and the
       government spheres Mrs Pandor has served as a role model to the women
       of South Africa and thus she fulfils all criteria for elevation to
       the status of Honorary Member of the South African Association of
       Women Graduates.

We take this opportunity, Madam Chair, to congratulate you on behalf of the
Council. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you very much. It is very embarrassing
to preside over such a motion. I think we will just note it. Should it be
moved? It is a most embarrassing motion to have moved.

Mr M E SURTY: Most certainly, Chairperson. I think you deserve the singular
honour that has been conferred on you, not by this House only, but by the
South African Association of Women Graduates.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move the motion printed in my
name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That the Council, subject to the concurrence of the National Assembly,
  establishes a joint committee in terms of Joint Rule 111 to consider the
  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, 2001.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

 DECLARING 2001 TO 2010 THE DECADE FOR NATIONAL MOBILISATION AGAINST RACISM

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr T S SETONA: Madam Chairperson, hon members, distinguished guests and
members of the press, today marks the eve of the fortieth anniversary of
the Sharpeville massacre, when unarmed men and women were killed by the
South African security forces.

The Sharpeville massacre was a watershed in the history of human rights
violations perpetrated against the African masses by successive white
minority regimes. At the heart of the apartheid colonialist system was an
inherent, institutionalised form of racial oppression and domination of the
African majority by the white minority.

It is against this background that the liberation movement in this country
evolved and matured to unite the democratic majority in the struggle
against tyrannical apartheid and racial oppression.

As we all strive in unison to nurture our democracy and the nation-building
project, we should do so mindful of our past as a nation divided along
ethnic, racial, class and gender lines. We should do so because a new
common South African identity has not yet been born, but is in the process
of construction, to be realised in our lifetime.

Since our country set out on the journey of nation-building and
socioeconomic reconstruction in 1994, the overwhelming hope for a
nonracial, democratic, nonsexist and prosperous South Africa for all has
from time to time been clouded by the immense social inequalities which are
the legacy of colonialism. These inequalities take the form of huge racial
disparities in all spheres of life in South Africa.

Our Constitution, which is the supreme law of the country and the
cornerstone of our democracy, begins with the following statement:


  We, the people of South Africa,
  Recognise the injustices of our past;
  Honour those who suffered for justice and freedom in our land;
  Respect those who have worked to build and develop our country; and
  Believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our
  diversity.

This preamble of our Constitution is clearly the battle cry of a nation in
search of a common identity and the enjoyment of equality and justice.

The inequalities of the past continue to define the lives of the majority
in terms of gender, race, human dignity, development and access to basic
social services. Clearly, race is the dominant feature of inequality in
present-day South Africa. It is the majority of black and African youth
that continue to suffer because of illiteracy, diseases and other forms of
social deprivation. It is the majority of black and African women,
particularly those in the rural areas, who continue to suffer because of
cultural, racial and other forms of social degradation. We find the
majority of our people who live under conditions of abject poverty in one
section of South Africa, namely the black and rural areas.

On the other hand, when addressing the expectations of the latter, we
should at all times be mindful of the section of society which has for
decades benefited at the expense of the other, not by choice but due to
institutionalised forms of racism.

We should send a clear message by way of our practical actions that the
betterment of life of the downtrodden should not mean their extinction.
They constitute both the present and the future of this country, a future
where we will all live in common brotherhood, peace and love.

As we stand here this afternoon, on the eve of Human Rights Day, we have a
great cause to celebrate: the six years of hope since 27 April 1994. We
should send a message of hope whilst acknowledging the enormity of the
problems at hand as we march forward.

We in the ANC are more than confident that despite the bumpiness of the
road we are traversing, a better future for all is guaranteed. The
Government has not merely paid lip service to addressing disparities in our
society, but has put in place institutions and mobilised resources for the
realisation of socioeconomic equality.
Chapter 9 of our Constitution establishes the Human Rights Commission,
whose aim is to enforce accountability on the part of the state and other
private entities by taking practical steps to respect, protect, promote and
further the rights contained in the Bill of Rights. The Human Rights
Commission has the judicial and legislative powers to ensure and enforce
the promotion and protection of a human rights culture in our country.

In these six years of hope, our Government has opened the doors of learning
and culture to all South Africans through the deracialisation of our
education system. We continue to bring hope to the rural poor through
legislation that seeks to change their conditions of life and the unequal
patterns of land ownership.

Whilst the rays of hope shine brighter and brighter, our problems continue
to run deeper, a challenge that we dare not fail to address. These problems
came more sharply in focus during the consultative meetings of the Human
Rights Commission in preparation for the national conference on racism in
July last year. Allow me to quote some extracts from the stories told by
ordinary South Africans during these public meetings. A first quote:
  We are insulted by being called ``mudslinging kaffirs'', and the farmers
  demanded that we leave and go and tell Mandela the jailbird.

A second quote:


  If you call ``mlungus'' by their first names, they get angry and their
  faces turn red.

A third quote:


  To me racism is like Aids. The only difference is that with Aids there is
  no cure, whilst with racism we are the cure ourselves.

These stories reflect the deeper problems besetting our practical efforts
at addressing racism in our country.

Whilst our Constitution and other pieces of legislation such as the
promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act outlaw
acts of racism, our own law enforcement agencies, the SA Police Service in
particular, continue to be riddled with racism. Instances have been
reported to the Human Rights Commission where members of the public
complain that when a black person is a victim a very junior official of the
SA Police Service is appointed as investigating officer, but when a victim
is a white, a very senior and competent official is appointed as
investigating officer. These are the realities of our time.

It is not a secret that social fabric crimes such as violence against women
get much publicity when the victims are white, but when the victims are
black there is no publicity, even when such cases are reported to the
media. Quite clearly, this calls for all of us to accelerate the
transformation of all public institutions to reflect the demographics of
our society.

The other critical challenge facing our country as we pursue our offensive
against racism is the question of xenophobia. Some amongst us, in dominant
positions within our society, have consistently, through their own words,
agitated black South Africans against African foreigners by spreading
misleading statements that these foreigners are taking away their
opportunities.

Why is this? Maybe we need to get answers. Is this not the same old divide-
and-rule tactic that characterised the white minority domination for
decades and inculcated ethnic divisions amongst blacks?

Clearly, hard and straightforward questions must be asked. Do we only have
black African foreigners in this country? How many white foreigners are
conducting business in this country without interference? How many are in
the Public Service and public institutions such as universities? Our task
is enormous, but we in the ANC are committed to uprooting racism in all its
manifestations.

Allow me to close my speech by dedicating this debate to the heroes and
heroines of our motherland, women, men and youth who died in the line of
duty in pursuit of nonracialism. To Albert Luthuli, Lilian Ngoyi, Chris
Hani, Solomon Mahlangu and many others we say: ``The cause you died for was
not in vain.'' [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, racism is a theory that states that human
abilities and qualities are determined by race. It is the belief that one
race is inherently superior to another. It ascribes negative stereotyped
qualities to individuals based solely on their racial origins, regardless
of their individual qualities.
Within the memory of everyone in this room, racism was more than just a
theory for the majority of South Africans. It was a real and ever present
assault on their humanity and dignity. The overwhelming majority of South
Africans of all races recognised this and reached into the well of their
common humanity and goodwill and found a way to dismantle the institution
that racism had become. This fact needs to be properly recognised, but we
also have to recognise that despite dismantling the institution of
apartheid we have to deal with the effects of decades of institutionalised
racism.

The resolution before us is one where every attempt should have been made
to achieve multiparty consensus, both as to its content and as to its
wording. Despite the fact that the document from the Human Rights
Commission has been available since at least the beginning of the year, we
in the NCOP received scarcely two working days' notice of this motion. The
DA wish to include in the resolution the eradication of poverty as well as
a sustained campaign against the HIV/Aids pandemic. At this point I must
thank the Chief Whip for a sincere and honest attempt to reach consensus
which was partly successful.

The Human Rights Commission itself, both expressly and implicitly,
recognised both of these concerns. I quote from the South African
Millennium Statement on Racism and Programme of Action issued after the
Human Rights Commission's conference on racism. Point 10 reads as follows:


  Conference acknowledges that economic policies of the past have served to
  marginalise rural people and their communities and have thus created a
  reservoir of poverty which has become a contemporary manifestation of
  racism.

Later on at the end of point 15:


  Tolerance implies accepting that human beings, naturally diverse in their
  appearance, situation, speech, behaviour and values are, nonetheless,
  equal in dignity and worth.

In the context of an individual's dignity and worth his or her situation
must include state of health, because an individual's state of health
should never affect their dignity or worth. Even if one disagrees and
argues that HIV/Aids is extraneous to racism as a concept, it should then
be noted that the Human Rights Commission itself included matters
extraneous to racism in its millennium statement, such as gender
discrimination and discrimination against the disabled. Clearly, HIV/Aids
and the eradication of poverty should enjoy equal status with the fight
against racism.

Why, then, is the ANC unwilling to accommodate the full proposal put
forward by us in regard to this resolution? Sadly, there is a pattern of
sophistry and manipulation of concepts and definitions to provide the ANC
with a dogma to unite their followers behind a common enemy: Racism as
defined by the ANC. The ANC tries to represent the divergent interests of
the unemployed masses, the black middle class and the black elite, whose
earnings according to recent research have outstripped those of their white
counterparts.

The one way to keep them all within the ANC laager is to create a new
ideology of total onslaught based on racism. Thus we see in the ANC's
submission to the Human Rights Commission inquiry into racism in the media
the concept of subjective and objective racism come to the fore.

According to their concept of subjective racism, white South Africans have
a stereotyped image of black South Africans that labels them as unfit to
govern. Thus any criticism of the ANC government, no matter how well-
founded, is delegitimised as being merely racist in its intent.

We have an opportunity to unite our country in finding a future free of
racism, based on our Constitution. However, it seems that the ANC needs to
keep racism, as they define it, alive as a type of insurance policy against
failure to deliver on their election promises.

Nksz P C P MAJODINA: Mhlalingaphambili, andizi kumphendula uMnu Lever.
Akhona amakhwenkwe amakhulu aza kuthetha ngaye phaya ezantsi. Mna
mandigqithise lo mcimbi ndiwuzeleyo, ubhengezo lweminyaka yama-2000 ukuya
kuma-2010 njengeminyaka yokubuncothula neengcambu ubuhlanga obugqubayo
kwizwe lakowethu.

Mandikhahlele kuwe Sihlalo osesihlalweni ngeli xesha. Mandingagxwali
emswaneni okomntu ongenathemba, ndingagxwali okomoni ofela ezonweni, kuba
sikho isisombululo kulo mbandela wobuhlanga. Kufuneka sibuheshe oku
komshologu, buphume buphele tu esizweni sethu. Xa sikwazile ukoyisa utshaba
olulucalu-calulo, singoyiswa yintoni na ukoyisa ubuhlanga?

Le ngxoxo iza ngexesha elihle nelifanelekileyo, ngosuku olwandulela
olwamalungelo oluntu awathi atyeshelwa ngexesha lenkqubo yocalu-calulo.
Akulula ke kambe ukulibala, kuba sisahleli nezivubeko zobuhlanga. Ubuhlanga
busagquba oku kweenkunzi zenkomo ezihlala buhlantini bunye.

Eli lizwe lakowethu lahlula-hlulwa laba lelabantu abamnyama nabamhlophe,
kwaye senziwa sangalingani. Thina luntu oluntsundu safaniswa nayo yonke
into embi eza nobumnyama. Senziwa ukuba siwatyeshele amasiko, sahendwa
ngamasiko asentshona kusithiwa awethu ziinkolelo. Ubuhlanga buziveza
ngeendlela ngeendlela ezahlukeneyo. Zimbi kuzo zenza amanyumnyezi kanti
ezinye zibanga umxhelo obuhlungu.

Thina bombutho wabantu satsho eKliptown ngo-1955 sathi silwela uMzantsi
Afrika okhululekileyo ongenabuhlanga, oza kuba likhaya kubo bonke abemi
bawo, omhlophe nomnyama ngokulingana. Sisatsho nanamhla oku, kwaye noMgaqo-
siseko welizwe ungecala likaKhongolose. Sasingabantu abanesidima nesathi
sahluthwa kuthi ngolunya bubuhlanga.
Sisonke singabemi baseMzantsi Afrika sinoxanduva lokwakha isizwe sethu,
lokwakha isizwe ngendlela entsha, amalungelo oluntu ahlonitshwe
kungajongwanga bala lamntu. Ubuhlungu kwelaseMpuma Koloni buqatsele kanobom
kwiifama ezithile apho abantu baphathwa gadalala okwezilwanyana
ngooNtamolukhuni.

NangokweziBhalo eziNgcwele - njengamntu uhamba inkonzo - kubhaliwe kwathiwa
umntu wenziwe ngokomfanekiso kaThixo, kwaye singumfanekiso kaThixo sisonke
singabantu, akukhethwanga bala. [Uwele-wele.]

UMongameli weli lizwe, iZizi elikhulu, uDlamini, uJama kaSijadu, uthi
ladlula ixesha apho umntwana womAfrika aza kuziva eneentloni ukuzibiza
njengomAfrika ngenxa yobuhlanga. Masibambane ngezandla, sakhe isizwe esinye
kuba umntu ngumntu ngabantu. Ukuze sibe nokubulwa buphele tu ubuhlanga
kufuneka siguqule indlela esicinga ngayo, samkele iinguqu, kuba asifuni
buhlanga, obujoliswa ngomnyama komhlophe okanye obujoliswa ngomhlophe
komnyama.

Abantu abasemagunyeni, iziphathamandla, mabangangeni ezikhundleni ngenxa
yombala wolusu lwabo, koko ngenxa yobuchule babo. Iculo lamaWesile
elabhalwa ngu P Sipamla lithi: ``Bulelani kuYehova''. Uthi, "Abantsundu
nabamhlophe mababulele kunye, mabavakalise bonke, baculele iNkosi".

Xa ndibhentsisa obu buhlanga busishiya siziingxwelerha, ndingakhankanya lo
mzekelo womama ophangela emakhitshini iminyaka ngeminyaka, oguqa ngamadolo
de amadolo abe pinki etyath' umntwana womnt'omhlophe emqolo, owakhe
engamazi nokuba uphi na. Namhlanje abo bantwana bamhlophe abasamazi ukuba
wayengunina owayebabeleka emqolo, ebancancisa.

Xa ndiza ngasekugqibeni, sakhula sidlala ngoonodoli abamhlophe, bengenziwa
oonodoli abamnyama kusenzelwa ukuba siqonde ukuba eyona nto intle ngunodoli
omhlophe oneenwele ezinde. [Uwele-wele.] Nabo oomama bethu bezityikila nge-
ambi kuba befuna ukuba mhlophe kuba kungathi kungcono ukuba mhlophe.
Babethwala iiwigi bolule iinwele ngamatye atshisayo.

Izizwe zonke ziyavuma ukuba uMzantsi Afrika uyincutshe ekulweni ubuhlanga.
Kwaye kujongwe kuthi ukuba sikhulule umhlaba wonke, yiloo nto nenkomfa
yamazwe ngamazwe iza kuqhutyelwa apha eMzantsi Afrika. Ndinenkolo ethi siya
koyisa siyimbumba. Masakhe ubuntu bethu sisadla amazimba, njengoko zatshoyo
iinkokeli zikaKhongolose zathi, ``Inkululeko ngexesha lethu,'' Kwaba njalo
ke. Masibuyele kundalashe, sikwazi nokunikezela ngenkomo yenqoma kwabo
bahluphekileyo. Zayaphi na iinkomo zenqoma? Mandiqongqothe esi sixhaxha
sikulo mbheka-phesheya wam. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs

[Nksz P C P MAJODINA: Chairperson, I will not respond to the hon Mr Lever.
There are big guys that will talk to him down there. I will just say what I
have to say on this issue: the years 2000-2010 as the years during which
racism that is so much in our country would be removed from its roots.

I would like to greet you, hon Chairperson who is chairing the Council at
this moment. Let me not waste time and repeat what other people spoke about
like someone who has lost hope, like a sinner who dies with his sins,
because there is a solution to this problem of racism. We must drive it
away altogether like a bad omen from our nation. If we could fight the
enemy of apartheid, what could stop us from beating racism?

This debate has come at an appropriate time, on a day preceding that of
human rights which were denied during the apartheid era. It is not easy to
forget because we still live with the scars of racism. People are still
grappling with racism, just like two bulls fighting for position in a
kraal.

Our country was divided between the black and the white people and we were
made to believe that we were not equal. We black people were degraded. We
were made to believe in Western ways of doing things at the expense of our
customs and traditions. Racism manifests itself in many different ways.
Some of them are very serious and some just make one sad.

We who belong to the people's organisation said in Kliptown in 1955 that we
were fighting for a nonracial South Africa that would be home to all its
citizens, black and white equally. We still maintain that statement and the
Constitution of the country is on the ANC's side. We were a very dignified
nation whose dignity was taken away by force by racism.

As citizens of South Africa we all have a responsibility to build our
nation, to build it in a completely new way where people's rights are
respected with no discrimination against colour. It is more painful to see
the conditions under which people live and work on the Boer farms in the
Eastern Cape.

According to the Bible - as a person who attends church - it is written
that a human being is made in the image of God; there is no colour.
[Interjections.]

The President of this country, the man from the Dlamini clan, Zizi, Jama of
Sijadu, says that the time is past for an African child to be shy to
identify him/herself as an African because of racism. Let us join hands
together in rebuilding one nation because a person is a person through
other people. In order for us to be able to fight racism completely we
should change our mindset and accept change because we would not like to
see racist attitudes by black people towards white people or vice versa.

People should not be appointed into positions of authority because of their
skin colour but because of their skills. A hymn written by P Sipamla says:
``Give thanks to the Lord''. He says that black and white people should
praise and sing unto Him.

When I expose the extent to which racism has damaged us, I would like to
cite this example of a certain mother who has been a domestic worker for
many years, who kneels until her knees turn pink while carrying a white
person's child on her back, not knowing the whereabouts of her own. Today
those white children do not know her as a mother who used to carry them on
her back, feeding them.

In conclusion, we grew up playing with white dolls. There were no black
dolls so that we would only appreciate a white doll with long hair.
[Interjections.] Our mothers used to use ambi face cream because they
wanted to change their skin colour because being white seemed better. They
would wear wigs and stretch their hair with stretching combs.

All nations see South Africa as a champion of fighting racism. These
nations are looking to us to free the entire world from the bondage of
racism, that is why the international conference is going to be held here
in South Africa. I have a belief that we will triumph if we are united. Let
us build our humanity while we are still alive, as the leaders of the ANC
said: ``Freedom in our lifetime''. So it has become. Let us go back to the
old ways when we could even offer to the poor. Those were my last words.
[Interjections.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The debates are intended to enrich
all of us and I noticed that there were people who definitely do not
understand Xhosa, but did not listen to the interpreters. I still need one,
even though I am Xhosa-speaking. We also have to look at our attitudes. Hon
member Nkuna oh, Nyakane. This speech made me dizzy. I apologise.

Mr R M NYAKANE: The apology is accepted, Chairperson. [Laughter.] To begin
with I would like to commend the SA Human Rights Commission for launching
the national conference on racism from 30 August to 2 September 2000. A
number of credible observations surfaced at this conference, the most
important of which were the 16 recommendations that were made for the sake
of the way forward. One of the recommendations made was that our Government
should consider declaring the decade of 2001 to 2010 as a decade for
movement against racism.

The dawn of democracy in South Africa cherished the hope that disrespect
for human life, dignity, integrity and the human worth of every individual
would soon be a thing of the past. However, it appears that racism is here
to stay. Lawrence Schlemmer has ably put it as follows:


  Race is a frequent theme in our menu of events. Every day, or every few
  days at most, a lurid news item appears under the rubric of racism. This
  will describe either physical conflict at a school involving pupils from
  different races ...

And, of course, this has happened in the Northern Province -


  ... or some or another act of brutality, usually by a small farmer, plot
  owner, shopkeeper or policeman against a labourer, alleged trespasser,
  shoplifter or suspect.

It will take many decades for the majority of South Africans, especially
blacks, to recover from the setbacks caused by the implementation of
apartheid policies, which were based on racism. Abject poverty, with the
related incidence of HIV/Aids, mass unemployment, unskilled labour amongst
the majority of blacks, inadequate primary health care amenities, to name
but a few, are products of the practices of racism. Blacks were recognised
as an underclass of people and, as such, had to survive on leftovers and
hand-outs and, of course, that was done on a mala fide basis.

Racism has become a syndrome. It has entangled human society in a web of
stereotypes, intolerance, hatred, xenophobia and racist consciousness.
Racism has been with us since time immemorial, and will continue haunting
human society for generations to come, unless more of our inner selves are
sincerely committed to the eradication of racism. When I talk of inner
selves I am sincerely looking forward to the day when a daughter of Mr Durr
could easily get married to a son of Mr Nyakane and establish a family
without any hitches. [Applause.]

It has plagued almost every sector of life. The SA Institute of Race
Relations has it that, ``when racism persists over a long period of time,
it often becomes embedded or hardwired into institutional structures and
systems.'' This statement is true because practices of racism can be traced
in religion, culture, economic activities, the marketplace, education,
sports, recreation and even the justice system.
Let no one pretend that racism is not a serious problem in South Africa.
The programme of action against the practices of racism has been put in
place for implementation by the conference. The time for pointing fingers
at each other has passed. It is of no use at this juncture to ask
interrogative questions, such as: Who is racist? Is it the whites? Or, to
answer: No, blacks are racist. Or, whites must apologise. And then to
counter that with: No, blacks have to apologise. It will get us nowhere.

In conclusion, allow me to share with this House an extract from the
periodical of the SA Institute of Race Relations, in that the process of
``national dialogue to combat racism, initiated by the Human Rights
Commission as a means to address racism, should be continued, extended and
deepened to all parts of South African society and become the
responsibility of all South Africans.''

On behalf of the UDM, I call on this Parliament, the NCOP, to declare the
decade 2001 to 2010 as a decade for movement against racism. [Applause.]

[Mrs C NKUNA: Hon Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister of Justice Mrs Gillwald,
hon members, I thank you. I am happy to stand here today and speak on
matters pertaining to fighting for freedom. We are still continuing to
fight for freedom.

In 1960, on 21 February, people died in great numbers, dying for me and
you. They were dying for our rights. Up to now we have not fully achieved
our freedom. We cannot say that we have achieved our freedom in full.

According to the South African Constitution, the Government should respect,
protect and promote human rights. There is a mechanism which has been put
in place to see to it that such things should be seen to take place. We
would be cheating ourselves if we were to say that laws which used to
support apartheid have been repealed, and that the way of living in South
Africa is good. All that is not true. Disputes will occur. Economic
discrimination still exists. People are still killing each other. It shows
the position in which South Africa is today.

There is still racial discrimination. Hon members, I come from the Northern
Province, where people are suffering in different ways, where people are
being killed by white farmers. People are being killed by white farmers.

Hon Chairperson, the hon member should consult the report on Human Rights.
In that report, she is going to get a reply to her question. I was still
saying that I come from the Northern Province where people are being
tortured and killed and I still wish to repeat what I said, namely that
people are being killed by white farmers.

At a conference that took place in Johannesburg at Sandton between 30
August and 2 September, the issue of racism was discussed at length. The
conference was conducted by the Human Rights Commission of South Africa.
Other points in the report I am going to explain in English.]

A farm worker named Jan Seepa in Alldays, a place in Messina, was requested
by a farmer to come and work during the Easter holidays. I do not know
whether it was a request or whether he was simply instructed to do so. That
was in 1998. Jan Seepa never returned home. After five days, the farmer
came to the family of Jan Seepa and told them that Jan had been beaten. As
to who had beaten Jan, it was not known. He said that he did not know where
he was. Later on, Jan's headless body was found in the river.

After an examination by the police, the death certificate said that a
crocodile had killed Jan. Then his head was found, examined and it was
found that there were no scars from the crocodile attack. A new death
certificate was issued in which the cause of the death was now unknown. No
investigations were made, and the docket was closed on the basis that there
was a lack of evidence. But a normal person can see who the killer was.

The second issue that I would like to mention is that racism is also
directed towards the community. For example, police collude with white
farmers who hire illegal immigrants to work on their farms. When it is time
for them to be paid, these farmers call the police and the workers are
deported.

I am not saying that attacks on farmers are the result of racism on the
part of farmers in the community. But it could be listed as one of the
factors which lead to these heinous crimes.

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, on a point of order. Could I please have some
clarity whether this is a debate on the decade for national mobilisation
against or for racism?

THE CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I cannot see what is out of order at
the moment. The hon member may continue.

Mrs C NKUNA: The media in the Northern Province is racist. There are two
newspapers, one aimed at whites and one at blacks. The very same two
newspapers are under the same company. A black journalist said that all
decisions are taken by a white editorial staff, and that the provincial
government is criticised left and right, whilst anything white is hardly
condemned. [Time expired.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Geagte Voorsitter, ek was gelukkig om as 'n kind twee
wonderlike oumas te hê wat hulle wysheid met my gedeel het. As vyfjarige
seuntjie wat pas begin skoolgaan het, het ek dan ook my eerste les ten
opsigte van rassisme gekry. My een ouma het my op 'n dag nader geroep en
gevra of ek al geleer het om gediggies op te sê by die skool. Sy vertel my
toe van 'n gedig waarin daar staan: ``Ek hou van 'n man wat sy man kan
staan''. En waarin daar op 'n stadium verwys word na die ``Bastergeslag''
wat die man ``in sy siel verag''. Sy het my daar laat beloof dat ek nooit
ooit daardie gedig sal opsê nie, omdat dit baie verkeerd is om enigiemand
volgens sy velkleur te beoordeel. Volgens haar was ons almal mense wat deur
God geskape is en ons is almal voor Hom gelyk.

Sy is ongeveer dertig jaar gelede oorlede, maar ek hoor steeds haar woorde
so duidelik asof sy dit gister vir my gesê het. Hierdie les het my altyd
bygebly en ek het nog altyd daarvolgens probeer optree. Dit het 'n
bepalende uitwerking op my lewensbeskouing gehad en ek glo dit is steeds
vandag uiters relevant vir elke Suid-Afrikaner. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Hon Chairperson, when I was a child I was fortunate to
have two wonderful grandmothers who shared their wisdom with me. As a five-
year-old boy who had just started school I also got my first lesson with
regard to racism. One of my grandmothers called me to her one day and asked
me whether I had already learned to recite poems in school. She then told
me about a poem containing the line: ``Ek hou van 'n man wat sy man kan
staan.'' In this poem reference is made to the ``Bastergeslag'', which the
man ``in sy siel verag''. She made me promise there and then that I would
never recite that poem, because it was very wrong to judge anyone by the
colour of their skin. She said all of us were created by God and all of us
were equal before Him.

She died about thirty years ago, but I still hear her words as clearly as
if she had told me that yesterday. I have never forgotten this lesson and I
have always tried to act accordingly. It has had a definitive effect on my
attitude to life and I believe that even today it remains relevant for
every South African.]

Much has been said during many debates in Parliament and at the TRC
hearings, and all over the country, from all sides, over the last couple of
years, about the deep wounds that the institutionalised system of race
discrimination of apartheid has caused in so many people in our country.

We must never forget the immense pain that apartheid caused to so many
millions of our people, so that we will never ever again allow anything
like that to happen in our country. President Mandela in his inaugural
speech on 10 May 1994 stressed the importance of stopping this vicious
cycle repeating itself when he said, and I quote:
  We are entering into a covenant that we shall build the society in which
  all South Africans, both black and white, will be able to walk tall,
  without any fear in their hearts, assured of the inalienable right to
  human dignity.

It seems that we as South Africans are starting to get it right, in that we
are starting to succeed in building the society about which President
Mandela spoke and which Archbishop Desmond Tutu named the ``rainbow
nation''. Unfortunately, since the "two nations" speech of President Mbeki
last year, undercurrents of racism and racial slurs started to reappear in
debates, as a way of attempting to win debate or as a defence mechanism
against criticism, despite its merits or demerits.

In two recent interviews, former President Mandela commented on the ANC's
sensitivity to criticism and the tendency to play the race card. In those
interviews, Mr Mandela called for tolerance of all political differences.
He talked about patriotism transcending party-political divisions. He
criticised some in the arrogant - his words - black - elite, who throw
their weight around and breed insecurity amongst minority groups. He
specifically referred to some leading members of the ANC for making matters
worse with - in his diplomatic words - unhelpful comments. He also pointed
to growing polarisation between race groups. We must understand the
important message contained in Mr Mandela's comments.

The tone of this year's state-of-the nation speech by President Mbeki was a
relief compared to last year. To his enormous credit, he preached the
harmony of unity, not the discord of division. We in the Democratic
Alliance will give him and the Government our full backing in a joint
endeavour to forge one nation in South Africa. Unfortunately, only one week
after the President's address, the ANC made itself guilty of a racist slur
of the worst kind in its online publication ANC Today, by accusing the
opposition and media groups calling for the lifting of the moratorium on
crime statistics, myself included, of being strongly committed to, and I
quote:


  ... the racist conviction that black people are inherently prone to crime
  ... [and the belief that] A predominantly black government would
  therefore never be able to contain crime precisely because it is black.

This unsubstantiated accusation is so absurd that, save for rejecting it
with the contempt that it deserves, it is really unworthy of comment. We
must all reject playing the race card and resolve to resume building the
process of reconciliation in our country. [Applause]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I would like the hon member to take
note of the fact that in this House he represents the New NP, not the DA.

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, Deputy Minister and hon members, South Africa
belongs to all its people, black and white. This was the message that we
sent out to all South Africans in 1955 when the ANC adopted the Freedom
Charter. It is in this message in that we can find our strength, conviction
and the desire to rid South Africa of the evils of racism and racial
prejudice. It saddens one to realise that, despite efforts to harmonise and
reconcile society, acts of racism continue to be perpetrated across the
human race.

Racism remains one of the great dividing factors between people of
different races. Racist acts can trigger terrible hatred, humiliation,
conflict, brutality and war. It stems from the fallacy that one race is
superior to another. It is difficult, if not impossible, to sustain such an
unfounded argument. This theory is based on the argument that one race is
superior to another because of biological or genetic make-up. This is
unfounded, for we all belong to the human race. The mapping of the human
genome is conclusive proof of this fact. Racism is therefore a social
construct learnt mostly at early childhood, nurtured and re-enforced in
life.

Racism is not unique to South Africa. Other countries worldwide have power
struggles, ethnic cleansing, genocide and war. This results from the
intolerance of humans towards one another. Apartheid was an unjust system
and a crime against humanity. This is the underlying cause of racism in
South Africa. We experience every form of racism. The crime for which
Terre'Blanche has been jailed, the poisoning of farmworkers and the recent
attack on a black woman by a white man are cases in point.

Racism can do only one thing, and that is to breed violence. Violence
breeds counterviolence and bloodletting. A South African writer once wrote,
and I quote:


  If blood is spilt, we make the future difficult. Blood is a means of
  binding us together. But blood that is spilt does not bind us together,
  but increases a gulf - a deep gulf - which in the history of a people
  like ours might be unbridgeable.

Racial resentment is still a powerful force. Everyone, regardless of colour
or gender, is facing the same problems that stem from a stagnant and
inequitable economic system which has fewer opportunities and which was
bequeathed to us by the apartheid system.

The response to Rudolph T Holhart, a white American who deals with the
question of racism and affirmative action, was that if one does not want to
be white, why does one not paint oneself black. Affirmative action is not
about quotas. It is an attempt to open more opportunities for women and
black people through progressive recruitment and outreach techniques. It is
a way of giving underrepresented groups of people greater access to
academic institutions and job opportunities, not exclusion on the basis of
race and gender. It is not about offering opportunities to unqualified
people. It is also not reverse discrimination against white males or
females.
During the past year, the SA Human Rights Commission held a national
conference on racism in order to assess the impact of racism in South
Africa. In the province of KwaZulu-Natal, where I come from, a wide range
of issues were raised, allowing a number of divergent voices to be heard.
Most submissions were more suited to a TRC-type of hearing. Many were
concerned with political violence, unemployment and poverty, and the
legacies of the racist apartheid regime. Apartheid succeeded in creating a
culture of racism in my province which we need to fight to the bitter end.

Several submissions dealt with gender discrimination and sexual inequality.
A speaker from a rural community detailed how women in her area were
treated as if they were the property of men.

Black women are underrepresented in business, particularly in senior
positions, compared with white, coloured and Indian women, and experience
the worst discrimination in the workplace.

Accordingly, 21 March, Human Rights Day, should be celebrated not only by
political parties at political rallies, but also by all those who are
committed to the concept of human rights. We should all be part of the
process defining this important national holiday as a day on which we all
commit ourselves to working together for a better life for all.

Submissions dealing with economic activities detailed how black people
continued to be exploited.

Racism in KwaZulu-Natal is more subtle than it was in the past, with black
people being least promoted and receiving meaningless skills development
programmes. KwaZulu-Natal also experiences racism in law enforcement and in
the criminal justice system. An example of this was black district chief
magistrate who had to step down because the legal representative of a white
farmer accused of assaulting black people insisted that he wanted a
magistrate who could speak Afrikaans. Systematic forms of racism in the
police, the army and correctional services were also detailed.

Power and gender discrimination, disparities in wealth and skills and in
access to opportunities all contribute to racist behaviour. Transformation
is central. Implementation of policies and programmes aimed at the
equitable redistribution of resources and access to opportunities is also
essential if racism is to be overcome.

Blacks in this country have emerged from a dark past divided by a history
of racial discrimination and filled with hopelessness. This was evident in
last year's conference on racism. We must engage this issue in a common
understanding and be tolerant towards one another as fellow South Africans.
We must endorse a culture of values based on fundamental human rights.

Article 1 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, and I
quote:


  All humans are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are
  endowed with dignity and conscience, and should act towards one another
  in a spirit of brotherhood.

Yes, these are the instruments that regulate peace, but they are frequently
ignored.

It is true that other forms of racism, such as xenophobia, exist. It must
be noted that the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, has
indicated that racism creates economic imbalances among citizens of the
country, leaving some richer and others destitute. It is from this
perspective that I think xenophobia should be seen, because black South
Africans feel that their jobs are no longer secure, for there are ... [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, my colleague from the Northern Province has
made me an offer for my beautiful daughter. I just want to say that I am
going to ask my friend and colleague Prince Zulu to act as my agent in
negotiating lobola. [Laughter.] They are both cattle farmers, and I am
going to ask for a high lobola. [Laughter.]

I wish to propose an amendment to the motion printed on the Order Paper
declaring 2000 to 2010 as the Decade for National Mobilisation Against
Racism. My proposed amendment is that we declare 2000 to 2010 as a decade
for national reconciliation and mobilisation against racism.

It is not enough to point out a problem; one also has to point out the
solution. It is very necessary for us to define the problems clearly. The
question is: How do we turn our best intentions on antiracism, which were
so well put by my colleague Mr Matthee, into positive and effective action
at all levels of society, engaging all levels of Government and civil
society as a whole in combating the evil of racism? It is a
multidisciplinary challenge.

On the negative side, how do we stop people, and curb ourselves for that
matter, from exploiting divisions and flaws in our society or individual
nontypical actions and then generalising upon them? How do we foster and
enjoy our diversity without exclusivism or cutting ourselves off from one
another? The United Nations recently said in a paper, Tolerance and
Diversity: A Vision for the 21st Century:


  For too long such diversity has been treated as threat rather than gift.
  And too often that threat has been expressed in racial contempt and
  conflict, in exclusion, discrimination and intolerance.

That is true. We must overcome that. We welcome the conference and we hope
that it will contribute to that. However, what can we do? It is not enough
to say things. We have to do things. We believe, as Christian democrats,
that reconciliation and transformation go hand in hand. We, as leaders -
church leaders and business leaders - should do something.
Therefore we welcome the united prayer meeting programme known as the Cape
Christian Celebration that is to take place at Fedsure Park Newlands Rugby
Stadium on Human Rights Day, tomorrow, 21 March. It is expected that more
than 40 000 people will attend from almost every church denomination and
there will be simultaneous participation, on DSTV, of huge groups in
churches throughout South Africa to pray for the transformation of our city
and country.

We welcome this initiative by businessmen, churches and community leaders.
We also acknowledge the community transformation that has already taken
place in some 40 cities around the world where levels of poverty, disease,
unemployment and crime have been drastically reduced as a result of
similar, concerted and united prayer. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, I must just say that it is quite a pity that
the prayer meeting that the hon member spoke about has been organised by
men only. No mention of women was made by Mr Durr.

I am a Capetonian. Thus I should make sure that whatever I say is based on
Cape Town, this city, in particular. This province is just one province
where racism and sexism are two inseparable twins. Hon members must have
read last week's newspapers, where an MEC in our province, in the
legislature just across the road, referred to one ANC member as something
that I do not want to mention because it is too rude to repeat. To call an
Indian woman a ``motjie'' is to reduce that woman to nothing.

The fact that I, as an African woman, can stand up in this Parliament today
to express my utter disgust at the continuation of racist practices and
attitudes by a certain sector of our society is already a victory which
indicates that the forces of racism are dying a slow death. It is a victory
that was made possible by the relentless struggles waged by ordinary people
under the banner of the ANC, not the NP - whether new or old - or the DP or
their doomed alliance. On the contrary, this victory was achieved in spite
of the combined effort of the last-mentioned parties to retain some of the
privileges that were bestowed on them by the apartheid system.

It is therefore not surprising that these very same parties are sitting
today in an alliance whose strategic objective is to frustrate the
fundamental transformation of our society and to deny that racism still
exists. Their hatred of transformation is clearly evidenced through their
opposition to key transformatory legislation such as employment equity and
through the racial composition of their provincial government with a single
African MEC. I must also note that he was imported from another province -
he does not belong here. It is also evidenced through their provincial
public service where white males dominate the management echelons, through
the selective allocation of provincial state tenders to white-owned
companies and through their continued attempts to blame the national
Government for everything that goes wrong in the province so as to hide
their own inadequacies.

Mr C ACKERMANN: [Inaudible.]

Mrs N D NTWANAMBI: That member had better listen to what I say, because it
is his government that is doing that. [Laughter.] Moreover, this is a
provincial government that spreads all its efforts in mobilising all
available resources if disasters such as fires threaten the property and
livelihoods of people in the more affluent white areas. However, it is only
prepared to give an insulting R400 per person to victims in black areas
like the Joe Slovo area, in the informal settlements, whose livelihood has
been destroyed by a devastating fire.

It is sickening to know that there are still people who cling to the
primitive notion that the lives and possessions of black people are less
important than those of whites. Being parties that represent white
interests, I am not surprised at the lack of compassion they show for
blacks, and I include African, coloureds and Indians. In fact, they are
known to have used coloured people as a buffer to protect their white
privileges against Africans in the Western Cape.

The exploitation of the coloureds' fears has been the major campaign tactic
of the New NP and, later, their doomed alliance. The working class
coloureds are manipulated into believing that they stand to lose their
privileged position in the provincial government and public sector if the
ANC takes over. Another racist tactic being used is to mislead coloureds
into believing that the reduction in social assistance grants, such as
those to pensioners and children, is because the ANC wants to take away
those grants from them to give to Africans. They cunningly exploit coloured
people's ignorance about why the grants were really reduced to suit their
racist campaign against Africans in this province.

Although we are still exposed to naked racism such as the painting of
blacks, a new kind of racism is emerging. It is a hidden kind of racism
that is dressed up in constitutional arguments such as the right to
language, the right of association and the right to property, to give
racism a veneer of respectability. [Interjections.]

That member is right. These kinds of racism appear to be mere talk and are
far removed from the open violence and forcible segregation of old racism.
Yet they may be just as effective to marginalise and exclude blacks. This
is a form of ethnic hegemony that is premised on seemingly legitimate
ideologies and attitudes which are often tacit accepted by most members of
a particular area. This was clearly shown by the refusal of people in the
white suburb of Newlands to allow a soccer match there. I am happy that Mr
Durr mentioned this and I am happy that just for a few hours black people
will be allowed there. However, if Safa were to organise another soccer
match in Newlands, there would be a big no from the city of Cape Town.

Phambi kokuba ixesha lam liphele, mhlalingaphambili, ndingatsho ukuba xa
ubani ejonga uMzantsi Afrika, ubona uMzantsi Afrika omanyeneyo, ngokoMgaqo-
Siseko, kodwa ukwabona nephondo eliseliphandle. Lilo lodwa iphandle apha
eMzantsi Afrika. Kuyakubaluleka okokuba iphinde le ngxoxo ekhona namanye
amalungu eNtshona Koloni, ngakumbi lawo aselulawulweni. [Kwaqhwatywa.]
(Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Before my time is over, Chairperson, I would like to say that when one
looks at South Africa, one sees a South Africa that is united by the
Constitution, but one also sees a province that is still a homeland. It is
the only province that is a homeland in South Africa. It is important that
we should engage in this discussion again when other members from the
Western Cape are present, especially those that are at management level.
[Applause.]]

Mr M J BHENGU: Madam Chair, I think that, perhaps, we need to correct the
impression that the motion means that after 2010 there will be no struggle
against racism. It actually means that we have to intensify it within this
period. Thus it means that even after 2010 we will be fighting against
racism.
I want to argue that when we talk of racism, one cannot actually neglect to
talk about colonialism. Of course, when one talks of colonialism, one
cannot stop talking about racism. Thus those two are intertwined.
Therefore, in that sense, racism seems to be a conscious ideology of
imperialism which has some interlinked features.

So, as an ideology, it is not felt as a matter of spiritual abstraction. It
is felt in the flesh, and in the practice of daily living. One of its worst
effects is that it numbs one's sensibility. It dehumanises one.

I have read texts by quite a number of people who have written extensively
on racism and colonialism. I especially have in mind my friend Franz Fanon,
who in his seminal work dissects it so clearly. I think Professor David
Welsh, who has retired from the University of Cape Town, puts it very
eloquently in the Leadership magazine of March 2000, when he says:


  In South Africa, racism has deep roots, so much so that it became
  entrenched in white cultures ...

I have chosen to quote him simply because I think he knows quite clearly
what he is talking about. The important thing here is that he says it is
entrenched in our cultures. I think that is where the problem is.

Omunye umbhali wezinkondlo zaKwaZulu uthi uma ebeka kwenye inkondlo, echaza
ububi bale nto okuthiwa ubandlululo, uthi: Umfowethu omhlophe
uyangiphundla, uthi ngiyanuka. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[One Zulu poet when he describes apartheid in one of his poems, says: ``My
white brother discriminates against me, he says I stink.'']

This means that a person said that another stank. It reminds me of what
happened to my youngest daughter, who goes to a multiracial school. A group
of her contemporaries at school told her that she stank. She came home
crying. I remember that my mother was so angry that she did not know what
to do.

When we talked to the principal, she apologised abjectly. What does this
tell hon members? It says that we still have parents who teach their
children that some races stink. [Interjections.] This is unfortunate. This
happened where I live in Westville, in my province, where there is still a
lot of racism.

Of course, from the perspective of my province ... [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, Deputy Minister for Justice and
Constitutional Development, members of this august House, if I could tell
hon members the stories which my son tells me about the school he goes to,
they would be very surprised. He goes to an Afrikaner school, where the
medium of instruction is Afrikaans. But I will not bore hon members with
those details.

I take this opportunity to welcome Miss Joyce Kgoali back to the NCOP. She
is now the provincial Whip. We are looking forward to her presence in the
House on behalf of our province, which is a people's province.

On the subject matter before the House, Clarence Darrow said the following
on 10 May 1926:


  The life of a negro has been a life of tragedy, of injustice and of
  oppression.

I wonder how many of us would refute Mr Darrow's statement, which he made
75 years ago. The currency of racism remains ubiquitous. It reportedly
occurs everywhere, as evidenced in daily newspaper reports. This morning
the Cape Times reported that an upmarket retirement complex in Rondebosch
does not admit people of colour, nor do they allow black carers into their
dining rooms to look after their elderly clients.

In Parliament we observe a similar trend in the following manner: The
opposition parties have continuously opposed any legislation that is of
relevance to the poor or advocates policies that are of a progressive
nature. For example, on 23 February the Minister of Finance tabled the
Budget in Parliament. He gave a concession on illuminating paraffin. This
is relevant to black people, the poor and the working class.

Illuminating paraffin is a primary source of energy for low-income
households in South Africa, especially in the nonelectrified rural areas
and in the informal settlements. Expenditure on illuminating paraffin
constitutes a significant proportion of expenditure of poor black
households. While it is exempt from all fuel levies, it will only be exempt
from VAT from April this year. The studies of the National Treasury have
indicated that the removal of VAT on illuminating paraffin will provide
significant distributive gains to poor households, which are black.

The hostility against this proposal by opposition parties is very
disappointing, and one questions the motive of their opposition. If I were
to raise the question: ``How did the economy of the previous order develop,
and what was their key instrument of growth?'' the answer would be: cheap
black labour.

Black people were the hewers of wood and carriers of water. I recently had
the privilege of meeting a US professor of economics, and his answer was
plain and simple when I asked him the question. He said that cheap labour
was an asset for the predominantly white economy. Cheap labour served as an
instrument, or should I say weapon, for the accumulation of wealth for a
few citizens of this country in the past. They are guarding it jealously
now.
The paradox is that when the present Government introduced its affirmative
action policy, there was a huge outcry from opposition parties. They even
wished that those words could be removed from English dictionaries. It was
these very same opposition parties that were the authors of affirmative
action in the past through the following institution: the Afrikanerbond.
This organisation used state capital to develop and stimulate the growth of
the Afrikaner and empower their business companies in the form of Sanlam,
Volkskas, etc.

It is ironic that these very same opposition parties now oppose policies
that they used so viciously to affirm their white electorate at the expense
of the black majority. This puts their motives very seriously in question.
Instead, the opposition parties ``intelligently'' put merits and
qualifications before any appointment that this Government hopes to make.
This is the irony of the millennium.

After their recent public hearings, the Human Rights Commission reported
the following: Black people in Gauteng face regular prejudice in terms of
access to the resources of financial institutions, and in terms of
admission to tertiary institutions and public institutions. For example, in
Alberton the previous transitional local council, before the new
demarcation, refused to allow people to bury their relatives on Saturdays,
because the council claimed they did not have the capacity, whilst they
were burying their counterparts during the week. That was clear, pure
racism, and it was against people's religion.

Through the public hearings of the Human Rights Commission it was clearly
indicated that white female prisoners were given light and soft jobs like
work in the cafeteria, whilst their black female counterparts were
subjected to hard duties like scrubbing floors. These are the kinds of
things that are clear indications.

Most importantly, we in the ANC are committed to making our democracy work,
and the country sustainable. We are therefore concerned about the way
forward. We cannot build a country with a past anger in our minds.
Countries are not built on the divisions and strife of their past, which
generated gross violations of human rights, the transgression of
humanitarian principles in violent conflicts and a legacy of hatred, fear,
guilt and revenge. We, at the receiving end of history, have made
innumerable compromises, but we have not seen reciprocal gestures from the
opposition parties.

Although we have our legal freedom, freedom is not won by instituting the
best policies in our Parliament.

This is only a humble beginning.

As Darrow argued, and I quote:


  In reality, every human being's life in this world is inevitably mixed
  with every other life, and no matter what laws we pass, no matter what
  precautions we take, unless the people we meet are kindly, decent, human
  and loving liberty, then there is no liberty. [Time expired.]

Mnr M A SULLIMAN: Kameraad Voorsitter, kameraad adjunkminister, dit is
vandag vir my 'n voorreg om aan hierdie debat deel te neem.

Na aanleiding van wat vandag hier gesê is, weet agb lede dit lei geen
twyfel dat rassisme nog in Suid-Afrika bestaan nie. In die provinsie waar
ek vandaan kom, die Noord-Kaap, sien 'n mens dikwels 'n voertuig wat voor
jou in die pad ry. Dan kyk 'n mens gewoonlik wie bestuur die voertuig, wie
sit langs die bestuurder en dan kyk jy wie sit agterop die voertuig. Ek wil
vir die agb Huis 'n tipiese voorbeeld hiervan beskryf. Dit is dikwels 'n
sogenaamde wit man wat die bakkie bestuur, die swart plaaswerker sit
agterop en die plaaseienaar se hond sit voor langs hom in die bakkie.

As dít nie blatante rassisme is nie, dan wil ek my naam nie hê nie. Hierdie
is dinge wat tans nog in hierdie land van ons, Suid-Afrika, gebeur. Nogtans
is daar diegene wat nog halsstarrig vasklou aan die idee dat rassisme nie
regtig bestaan nie, maar dat dit 'n ANC-komplot is om sogenaamde witmense
in opposisie partye te demoniseer, en is daar mense wat doof is of weier om
die realiteite van die samelewing te aanvaar.

Ek wil vandag 'n pleidooi tot al hierdie partye rig om ernstig te besin en
te aanvaar dat rassisme wel bestaan en ernstige gevolge vir nasiebou en
versoening inhou. Indien dit nie aangepak word met die erns wat dit verdien
nie, kan dit ernstige gevolge vir ons land inhou. Ek wil terselfdertyd 'n
vriendelike waarskuwing aan hierdie partye rig: Die ANC gaan nie op hulle
wag totdat hulle eendag besef hulle was verkeerd nie. Ons sal voortgaan om
hierdie euwel met wortel en tak uit te roei.

Stappe is reeds in hierdie opsig gedoen, soos die inwerkingstelling van die
wet op die bevordering van gelykheid en die voorkoming van onregverdige
diskriminasie en die toepassing van regstellende aksie. Wat die kwessie van
regstellende aksie betref, meen ek dit is hoog tyd om die valshede wat deur
opposisiepartye versprei word vir eens en vir altyd bloot te lê. Veral die
argument dat regstellende aksie omgekeerde rassisme is en veroorsaak het
dat van ons bekwaamste mense die land verlaat, is al so baie kere deur die
DA herhaal, dat hulle dit nou self begin glo.

Indien regstellende aksie aanleiding gee tot grootskaalse emigrasie van ons
bekwaamste breinkrag, beteken dit die DA-lede wat in die land agtergebly
het, is nie eintlik bekwame mense nie. Ek sal nie verbaas wees indien dit
wel die geval is nie, veral gesien in die lig van die soort politieke
argumente wat hulle aanvoer en natuurlik hul swak vertoning in die
verkiesings.

Die DA se stelling dat regstellende aksie grootskaalse emigrasie van
bekwame mense veroorsaak, is nie net 'n belediging vir hulself nie, maar
ook vir ander bekwame mense wat besluit het om in die land agter te bly om
'n positiewe bydrae tot nasiebou en versoening te lewer.

Om te argumenteer dat regstellende aksie omgekeerde rassisme is, is om die
historiese agtergrond wat daartoe aanleiding gegee het, te misken. Dit is
soos om Sionisme met rassisme te vergelyk. Albei is uitdrukkings van rasse-
eksklusiwiteit. Die Jode se hunkering na 'n eie staat is egter op hul
geskiedenis gegrond. Geskiedkundige waardes het uit die wêreldwye
vervolging van die Jode gegroei. Kan 'n mens dus sê die ontstaan van
eksklusiwiteit en 'n Joodse staat is rassisties? Nee, ons kan nie, omdat
die ontstaan van so 'n Joodse staat geregverdig word deur die historiese
vervolging van Jode gedurende die Tweede Wêreldoorlog.

Soortgelyk het die toepassing van regstellende aksie gegroei uit die
historiese onderwerping van swartmense as tweedeklasburgers. Ekonomiese
wanopvoeding en verwaarlosing asook geïnstitusionaliseerde diskriminasie
het plaasgevind. Daarom kan ek nie sê dat regstellende aksie omgekeerde
rassisme is nie, omdat die historiese onderwerping van swartmense die
toepassing van regstellende aksie regverdig.

Die tyd het aangebreek dat daar wegbeweeg moet word van die benadering van
``ons'' en ``hulle'' en 'n inklusiewe benadering gevolg word soos wat die
ANC doen. Ons hoofdoel moet wees om 'n samelewing te skep waarin dit nie
vir mense nodig is om tussen hul medemense in vrees vir hul lewe te leef
nie. Dit is 'n samelewing wat die ANC probeer skep, maar ons sal nie in ons
poging slaag indien sekere mense nog vasklou aan rassisme nie.

Ter afsluiting wil ek die Huis graag vertel van 'n interessante voorval wat
ons eendag op 'n vliegtuig te beurt geval het. Die weer was daardie
spesifieke dag vreeslik onstuimig en die vlieënier was 'n swartman. Ons is
'n bietjie deur stormagtige weer geteister. Die passasiers wat langs my
gesit het, het later gesê ``maar hoekom het hulle dan nou vandag hierdie
swartman gevat om ons vlieënier te wees?''. Dit is die soort vooroordele
wat bestaan, maar ons moet, en ons sal, hierdie euwel wat ons land tans nog
kniehalter vir ewig en altyd uitroei. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mr M A SULLIMAN: Comrade Chairperson, Comrade Deputy Minister, it is a
privilege for me to participate in this debate today.

Arising from what has been said here today, hon members know that there is
no doubt that racism still exists in South Africa. In the province from
which I come, the Northern Cape, one often sees a vehicle travelling before
one on the road. One then normally looks to see who is driving the vehicle,
who is sitting next to the driver and then one looks at who is on the back
of the vehicle. I want to describe to the hon House a typical example of
this. Often it is a so-called white man driving the bakkie, the black
farmworker is sitting on the back and the farm owner's dog is sitting next
to him in the front of the bakkie.

If this is not blatant racism, I will eat my hat. These are things which
are currently still happening in this country of ours, South Africa. Yet
there are those who still stubbornly cling to the idea that racism does not
really exist, but that it is an ANC conspiracy to demonise so-called white
people in opposition parties: there are those who are deaf or refuse to
accept the realities of society.
Today I want to appeal to all these parties seriously to reflect and to
accept that racism does indeed exist and has serious consequences for
nation-building and reconciliation. If it is not tackled with the
seriousness it deserves, it could have serious consequences for our
country. At the same time I want to address a friendly warning to these
parties: The ANC is not going to wait for them to realise one day that they
were wrong. We will continue to completely eradicate this evil.

Steps have already been taken in this regard, such as the introduction of
the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act and
the application of affirmative action. As far as the issue of affirmative
action is concerned, I think it is high time to expose the falsities spread
by opposition parties once and for all. Particularly the argument that
affirmative action is reverse racism and has caused some of our most
competent people to leave the country, has been repeated so many times by
the DA that they have now begun to believe it themselves.

If affirmative action has led to large-scale emigration of our most
competent brainpower, it means that the DA members who have remained in the
country are not actually competent people. I would not be surprised if this
were indeed the case, particularly in the light of the sort of political
arguments they present and of course their poor showing in the elections.

The DA's statement that affirmative action causes large-scale emigration of
competent people is not only an insult to themselves, but also to other
competent people who have decided to remain in the country to make a
positive contribution towards nation-building and reconciliation.

To argue that affirmative action is reverse racism, is to disregard the
historic background which has led to it. That is like comparing Zionism
with racism. Both are expressions of racial exclusivity. The Jews' yearning
for an own state, however, is based on their history. Historical values
have emerged from the worldwide persecution of Jews. Can one therefore say
that the emergence of exclusivity and a Jewish state is racist? No, we
cannot, because the creation of such a Jewish state is justified by the
historic persecution of Jews during the Second World War.

Similarly, the application of affirmative action grew from the historical
subjugation of black people as second-class citizens. Deficient economic
training and neglect as well as institutionalised discrimination took
place. I therefore cannot say that affirmative action is reverse racism,
because the historic subjugation of black people justifies the application
of affirmative action.

The time has come that we should move away from the approach of ``them''
and ``us'' and follow an inclusive approach as the ANC does. Our primary
goal must be to create a society in which it is not necessary for people to
fear for their lives among their fellow men. This is the society which the
ANC is trying to create, but we will not succeed in our objective if
certain people continue to cling to racism.

In conclusion I would like to tell the House about an interesting incident
which happened to us one day on an aeroplane. On that specific day the
weather was particularly tempestuous and the pilot was a black man. We were
somewhat battered by stormy weather. The passengers sitting next to me said
after a while: ``but why did they take this black man today to be our
pilot?''. These are the sort of prejudices which exist, but we must, and we
will, permanently eradicate this evil which is currently still hampering
our country. [Applause.]]

Ms S N NTLABATI: Chairperson, let me also join all the other speakers in
rededicating myself to the declaration of the next ten years as the Decade
for National Mobilisation Against Racism. Equality is the cornerstone of
every democratic society which aspires to social justice and human rights.
When I talk about a democratic society I am talking about the South African
society which largely claims to be believers and Christians. I would like
to refer the latter to a book which directs their lives and which says that
a human being was created in the image of God. To me this means that
everyone who professes to be a believer will agree that we have to get rid
of racism.

In virtually all societies and spheres of activities, Africans and
minorities were subjected to inequalities in law. In fact, this situation
was both caused and exacerbated by the existence of discrimination in the
family, the community and the workplace. While this Council is preoccupied
with political developments, human rights abuses and racism continue
unabated, by the day becoming insidious both in scope and character. We
probably talk too much about it and our people tend to exaggerate it.

Over the years the United Nations has decried racism and, in the same
context, has described apartheid as a crime against humanity. In order to
rededicate ourselves it is necessary that we reflect on the things which
happened in the part. Let me tell this House that human rights abuses and
racism in our society were perpetrated against psychotic or mentally ill
people. They were viewed as being different by the health sector.

I will give members an example. Early in the morning at 7:00 am in mental
hospitals, black female patients would be made to clean in their own
section, and then go up to the white section to clean, even though there
were white female patients to do that. That is how entrenched inequalities
were, and I am talking about psychiatric hospitals. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order!

Ms S N NTLABATI: Chairperson, I said I was going to reflect on what
happened in order to mobilise society. We have now repealed those laws that
bore policies of apartheid. What is left now is to bring about a nonracial
democratic society.

I think I need to talk about my province, the Free State.

During the past few months, organisations representing the interests of
farmworkers in the Free State have drawn attention to the prevailing racism
on farms. They work on farms on a daily basis in order to come up with
reports. Racism on farms is expressed in the form of insults, physical
assaults and bad treatment. The situation is more serious because of the
lack of intervention structures for farmworkers who have few if any
effective ways to access resources.

They have been denied managerial positions simply because of race, and they
are paid less than their white counterparts even if they are managers. A
representative from a farmworkers' union in the Free State took this report
to the Human Rights Commission, as unfair evictions have skyrocketed since
1995. In many cases, employers defy orders of the labour court to reinstate
workers who were unfairly dismissed, simply because some feel that Mbeki is
not a farmer, ``so do not tell us anything.''

I want to tell the House about concerns regarding police collusion, which
has been found to be very prevalent in the Free State. Evidence was found
that membership of the SA Police Service in the Free State were conniving
with white farmers to intervene and harass workers on labour-related
issues. This was because they were bribed.

One of the problems highlighted in institutions of higher education was
that there were still policies of separate development. In the province I
come from, university students being together was unknown. I remember an
incident in the seventies during the days of black consciousness. Black
students were asked whether they would like contact with their counterparts
at the University of the Orange Free State, as it was called then. They
were asked in Afrikaans: ``Can you pick up a shovel?'' And they were also
asked: ``When you do your washing, do you do it thoroughly?'' They were
asked questions like that. That is where we come from in my province.

In order to address this crime, the concept of equality must mean more than
treating all persons in the same way, because we cannot. We are at
different levels. Treating us at the same level would mean that those who
have been disadvantaged may still remain disadvantaged. That is why there
has to be some affirmative action.

I want to address people of all races in the Free State and tell them that
we have laws in this country which tell the Xhosa people, and the Sotho
people, to stop calling people ``Amakula''. People are not called coolies
any more. To the Afrikaners I want to say there are no coolies any more. In
order to mobilise, we have to be fair and do some introspection. There are
no longer people called ``Amalawu'' or ``Amaqheya'', as we, the Xhosas,
used to call them.

I want to tell this House that I am rededicating myself. Tomorrow morning
at 09:00, we shall be launching a regional office of the Human Rights
Commission at Hoffman Square in Bloemfontein. From then on we shall carry
forward the message which originated in this House, and that is to
mobilise. This is the decade for all races and we hope they will all be
there. [Applause.]
Mr T B TAABE: Madam Chair, hon members, I wish to thank you for giving all
of us this afternoon the gargantuan opportunity to discuss, yet again, in
this august House, the important matter of the demon of racism and other
related offences.

Before I start dealing with the details, allow me to draw the attention of
the House to a few critical issues, issues that have been consistently
raised in this august House. They are embodied and enshrined in our
Constitution, basically enjoying all South Africans across the racial
divide and spectrum. This Constitution provides an historic bridge between
the parts of a divided society characterised by strife, conflict, untold
suffering and injustice. It provides for a future founded on the
recognition of human rights, on democracy and on peaceful co-existence and
development opportunities for all South Africans, irrespective of colour,
race, class, belief and sex.

I believe that as we discuss the issue of racism, we, as members of this
House, need to do a number of things. Most important and to which I am sure
all of us are going to respond, is that we should commit ourselves to the
pursuit of the objectives contained in the Constitution of this country,
democratic as it is, forever - as long as we live.

Significantly, we should ask ourselves in relation to what has already been
said, how much progress we have made as a country, to ensure that we indeed
create a nonracial society, so that as a country we indeed are able to heal
the divisions of the past, and that we are indeed able to achieve peaceful
coexistence for all our people, as well as creating development
opportunities for all.

As a nation we should therefore move as rapidly as possible to transfer
South Africa into a truly nonracial state. We must ensure that our country
lives up to its constitutional commitment of transforming itself into a
nonsexist, democratic and nonracial society. Our people have had enough of
the kind of racist practices and tendencies which continue to bedevil
society at all its levels, up to this very day.

For this to happen, we should call on all South Africans to join the fight
to eradicate the legacy of apartheid in this country. We need a united
offensive against racism and, indeed, a concerted effort must be made to
advance the interests of those least capable of defending themselves,
including our dearest children, women, the disabled, and the elderly who
are the most vulnerable in this society.

If the situation in this country as it stands, persists ...
[Interjections.] I am sorry to point out, but the deranged fool that the
hon member Lever is, has just said things that are trash and poppycock and
has done so deliberately, in utter disrespect of this House ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Order! Could you take your seat, hon
member?

Yes, Mr Matthee?

Mr P A MATTHEE: Madam Chair, is it parliamentary to call a member of this
House a deranged fool? I really want to ask that you make a ruling on that.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mr Taabe, I do agree with the hon member. I do
not think that is the kind of language I would like to allow in the NCOP
and I would ask that you withdraw that comment.

Mr T B TAABE: Madam Chair, you have my retraction.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you.

Mr T B TAABE: Madam Chair, the point that I was making is that if we allow
the kind of situation that in this country we find ourselves to persist in
spite of the gift of hope delivered to the people by the birth of
democracy, the more entrenched will be the conviction that the concept of
nation-building and a nonracial South Africa is a mere mirage, and that no
basis exists, or will ever exist, for reconciliation to take place in this
country. This is a fact.

The problem that some of us have is that when the President of this
country, President Mbeki, consistently makes the point, and correctly so,
that our past determines the present, in order for us to begin to deal
decisively with the problems and the challenges facing this country, he
invites hostile ridicule and protest.

This is, of course, from the white media, ably represented in this Chamber
by the Democratic Alliance, and from the overtly racist opposition which
has suddenly ganged up somewhat against anything that seeks to advance the
cause of the historically disadvantaged in this country. This is something
we are going to challenge.

When President Mbeki makes the point that no solution to the many current
problems can be found in this country unless we begin to understand their
historical origins, he is continually vilified, not only outside this
Chamber, but in this very Chamber. He is castigated, he is demonised and he
is called all sorts of names.

We must make it clear that when those who do anything to ensure that they
reverse the kind of progress we have made as a country ... [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr M E SURTY: Madam Chair, as I look at you, an African woman presiding in
this august House, I feel and I believe that the struggle for those who
fought and laid down their lives in Sharpeville 41 years ago was, indeed,
not in vain. When I look to my right I see a young, eloquent lady Minister
- representing the nation, I believe that the struggle of those who laid
down their lives for our human rights was not in vain.

When I look at the discussions we had this morning among different
political parties to commit ourselves to a resolution to fight racism and
committing this country and this nation against racism, I believe that
those who struggled and laid down their lives did not do so in vain. They
did so for the affirmation of our human worth, our human dignity and for
the commitment to a nonracial and nonsexist society.

I think it is important to understand the context in which this debate has
taken and is taking place, namely that of a conference on nonracism which
was convened by the Human Rights Commission. This was at the insistence of
the President. It was very well attended and it was unanimously agreed that
certain things had to be done by this country, not only by Government and
not only by politicians, but by civil society, by NGOs, and by all citizens
of this country, to combat racism.

The debate also takes place against the background of the fact that this
year South Africa will be hosting the third United Nations conference
against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.
In other words, this debate is central to the theme of racism, racism which
afflicts not only South African citizens, but racism which is a global
phenomenon, which nations are grappling with and regarding which they are
looking to South Africa for a solution. South Africa is a country which was
able to marry diverse cultures, languages and races, united in action
towards a better South Africa.

It is for this reason that we, as representatives, have a particular
commitment, and responsibility, to ensuring that we do not go into denial
mode, that we do not deny that racism is, in fact, the legacy with which we
have to deal, that it still persists in our society, and that we have to
take active steps in dealing with it.

I am rather disheartened at the suggestion that the proposal of the DP did
not receive attention. I am glad that Mr Lever is here. I thank him for his
kind remarks that the Chief Whip had done whatever was necessary in
ensuring that we reconcile the views of the parties. We all agreed
collectively - and I will go into the detail of this resolution - that
apartheid was declared a crime against humanity. This was the common
position and was confirmed by members of the opposition in their speeches.
Mr Matthee, in particular, said that he never ever wanted to have the
experience of an apartheid era or an apartheid experience.

We also confirmed that, despite the fact that South Africa is nonsexist,
nonracial and democratic in terms of its Constitution, there are disturbing
signs that racism persists. Its manifestations are evident, and there was
no disagreement about that. We also agreed this morning that poverty, and a
lack of education and health for the vast majority of our people are direct
results of the structured and institutionalised racial oppression of the
past. There was no dispute about that. There was common agreement between
political parties in so far as that was concerned. Mr Durr last week also
confirmed that he regarded poverty as a key element in terms of
alleviating, removing or eliminating discrimination.

We also agreed that poverty has a direct relationship with illiteracy; with
the incidence of pandemics, such as HIV/Aids, tuberculosis, cholera and
malaria; and with the general marginalisation of the majority of our
people, although the stress in terms of the other political parties was on
HIV/Aids. However, there was agreement that these endemics were, in fact,
caused quite directly by, or were directly related to, poverty. We agreed,
also, that we should utilise the resources of our state in order to ensure
that we confront these challenges and make all efforts to enhance the
quality of the lives of our people.

If being in a nonracial society means the affirmation of our dignity, and
the affirmation of our dignity means the enhancement of our self-esteem,
then they occur only through enhancing education, and providing resources
for health, for social welfare and for development of wellbeing. Human
dignity cannot and will not be enhanced unless poverty is eliminated and
unless we enhance the capacity of the individual to rely on his or her
potential.

There has been no disagreement about any one of these aspects. We agreed
collectively that we would support the millennium statement of the Human
Rights Commission. We also agreed that we would commit ourselves to the
programme of action. This brings me to Mr Durr's point. Certainly
reconciliation is important, but a programme of action of the Human Rights
Commission, to which this House is committing itself, sets out a
comprehensive programme in reconciling the different and diverse interests
of this nation in confronting the challenge of racism. We also resolved
quite collectively to declare 2001 to 2010 as the decade of national
mobilisation against racism.

That is the South African context. This is the context within Parliament or
within the National Council of Provinces. Given the fact that we have Human
Rights Day on Wednesday, an event that will be celebrated by 35 000
community stations worldwide - worldwide! - to declare the day as a day
against racism, not in South Africa, but worldwide, and 35 000 community
stations are going to debate this, and given the fact that we are going to
have the United Nations conference on racism which is an international
conference that will take place in our country, it is appropriate that we
in fact adopt a motion based on the key factor. The legacy that we come
from is the legacy of apartheid. The basis of our division was generated
and perpetuated through the institutionalised system of apartheid.

It is because the President raised the fact that there are two nations,
that we are a divided nation, that we rise today to say that we have to
confront racism, that we have to look an economic disparities that occur
within our society. We have to look at social disparities, and we have to
look at disparities in terms of health and welfare. I believe that, as
divisive as this may seem to some members, it is, in fact, a historical
milestone in bringing the nation to terms with the demon of racism.

Chairperson, having said that, I have circulated the resolution and, with
your permission, may I please read the resolution for adoption? I assume
that you will be putting the resolution ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Your time has expired, hon member.

Mr M E SURTY: Chairperson, would you guide me in terms of the resolution?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I will allow you an opportunity at the
conclusion of the debate, hon member.

Mr M E SURTY: Oh, at the conclusion of the debate. Thank you so much,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson, I would like to thank you for this invitation to speak in the
NCOP on this landmark debate on racism. But before I proceed to the body of
my speech I need, possibly, to respond to some of the issues that have been
raised this afternoon. I have tried to choose the most pertinent, but I
want to thank all hon members for their contributions. So if hon members
are not singled out, it is not because of the lack of importance thereof. I
just have limited time.

I would also like to welcome back an old friend. It is great to see hon
member Joyce Kgoali.

I just need to explain to Mr Matthee - I think this has been explained so
often that I am loath to give time to it because of my limited speaking
time - that the issue of statistics is really a nonissue. It is precisely
because the Department of Safety and Security wants the information that is
given to the public to be accurate, to be reliable and to be trustworthy
that it has had to put a moratorium on it. Information collection practices
that have been applied in the past are inappropriate and so are the
classifications.

The department has employed and trained 300 additional people just to deal
with statistics, and I have to say that the department is committed to
providing appropriate statistics as soon as it can. I understood from the
briefing we had at the beginning of this session that it would be before
the end of June. So this is really a nonissue, and I really believe that
the department will be able to give us statistics that we can rely on - I
honestly do.

The second issue is in response, possibly, to the hon Botha's very
defensive little points of order, and I will not use my own words. I will
use the words of the editor from the Business Day, and this was not
intended for my speech here, but for another speech that I had prepared for
later on this afternoon:


  White farmers have a special history to live down. The labour regime on
  farms has been repressive and patriarchal. Because they own so much of
  South Africa, farmers are seen as the prime expropriators of indigenous
  land. They were one of main client bases of the NP during apartheid. In a
  country ruled by the black majority, they need to go out of their way to
  be sensitive to those who share the land with them.

It is precisely because there is no evidence of this that people respond in
the emotional and painful way that they do. I would appeal to all farmers,
and I have seen many, many farmers in my constituency that do a great deal
towards land reform, but I have seen too many cases where people of colour,
Africans and coloureds, particularly in the Free State, get the rawest deal
on farms, and we have to change that around. We just have to.

Then I have to respond to the hon Lever, who attempts unsuccessfully to
fudge the issue of racism by quoting selectively from a statement by the
Human Rights Commission on racism. The HRC has expressed itself on racism
in that statement and in other forums and documents on the separate issues
of poverty and HIV - and this is appropriate. This forum, here today, is to
discuss the issue of racism, and that is very important. His is an exercise
in convoluted extrapolation and absolutely obscure deduction.

We will resist the attempts of the DP to look away from the single issue
that defines that party, its policies and its approach to this debate and
to the majority of the people in this country. Are they not the people who
opposed the enabling legislation for the procurement of cheap medicines to
deal with Aids? They really have to get their house in order on this issue,
because they are all over the place.

The Government, as hon members know, was petitioned by the National
Conference on Racism, held from 30 August to 2 September last year, to
declare the period 2001 to 2010 the decade for mobilisation against racism.
Hon members will recall that President Mbeki introduced the theme during
his address at the official opening of Parliament on 4 February 2000. He
then called for a national conference on racism to be convened and
requested the SA Human Rights Commission to lead the task. As hon members
well remember, it led to another cathartic moment in post-apartheid South
African history.

This momentum is being maintained with South Africa hosting the third UN
World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and
Related Forms of Intolerance in Durban later this year. It is anticipated
that close to 150 countries will attend and participate in the Third World
Conference Against Racism - I had to separate ``third'' and ``world''
distinctly - with close to 20 000 delegates attending. And there will be a
parallel conference of the international NGOs where it is anticipated that
close to 12 000 delegates will be participating.

The invitation to host the conference came at the request of the UN
Commission on Human Rights and High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary
Robinson, who recognised South Africa's unique role and experience in
providing the setting for the proposed action campaign. We feel greatly
honoured that the international community, in recognition of our commitment
to the struggle for a nonracial world, should have chosen our country to
host such an important international gathering.

We are committed to act in unity with the rest of the world to confront
this challenge together with, and under the guidance of, the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights when we host the auspicious international event
during August this year. We are convinced that this important initiative
will help to move our country faster towards the realisation of the goals
contained in our Constitution of the creation of a nonracial and nonsexist
society.
The declaration of the period 2001 to 2010 as the decade for national
mobilisation against racism will serve to fulfil other very important
objectives. It will enable us as a country, as a nation and as a people to
place the problem of racism on the national agenda; to have a national
focus on the problems of racism; to raise the level of national
consciousness about the problem; to develop clear timeframes for tackling
the problems of racism; and to develop a long-term strategy, as opposed to
ad hoc, incident-related responses for combating racism.

Our successes in the struggle to move our country from apartheid to
democracy have led many people to reach the premature conclusion that
racism in South Africa is dead. This is despite the obvious and naked fact
that to this day the racial divisions, inequalities and prejudices of our
past continue to characterise our society. Some in our country are so
determined to close their eyes to reality that those who are forced to
swallow the bitter fruit of racial inequality and arrogance are regularly
rebuked for speaking out against the pain they continue to endure.

We all cringe when we see or hear about naked acts of racism when we switch
on the television or tune in to the radio. But these reports continue to
expose the thorn in this nation's flesh. These are often shocking images we
see, or words that we read, however repugnant, fulfilling an important
function in that they bring us face to face with the brutality of the
racism that will continue to exist in our society unless all of us engage
this beast, consciously and systematically. This requires all of us to
promote the understanding of the nature, meaning and manifestations of
racism in our country, and to participate in programmes for the elimination
of all forms of racism.

I sincerely believe that we must never forget that the origins of Human
Rights Day, which we will all be celebrating tomorrow, were born in the
valiant fight against racism by consecutive generations of racially
oppressed South Africans. It is our duty to remind our youth, time and
again, of the battles, of the struggles, of the sacrifices that were made
to achieve our democracy and freedom, and that these were often the supreme
sacrifice.

The 21st of March is one of those days which are immortalised in our
history. We must never forget the bravery of our people and their refusal
to accept an unjust and brutally repressive regime, when on that day, on 21
March 1960, tens of thousands marched to the police station in Sharpeville
to hand over their hated dompas to the authorities and choose, consciously
and willingly, imprisonment rather than denigration and humiliation.

So every year when we commemorate Human Rights Day we must remember that we
are paying tribute to our brave forebears and to those marchers who were
brutally murdered on that day. But our celebrations of our freedom are also
marked by sadness, as we remember the supreme sacrifice so many had to make
so that today we can indeed taste the sweet fruit of liberty.

The events which took place at Sharpeville all those years ago so horrified
and inspired the world that this day was chosen by the United Nations for
the coming into force of the international convention against the
elimination of all forms of racial discrimination, which, as members know,
became the first international treaty which our new democratic Government
signed and ratified.

Let us also remember how significant 21 March has become, not only to South
Africans, but to the international community, for tomorrow is not only
South Africa's Human Rights Day but is also celebrated internationally as a
day against racism.

Let us all join hands in a show of strength and commitment to finally
defeat racism so that we can celebrate true reconciliation on future Human
Rights days. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  apartheid was declared a crime against humanity;


       (b)  despite the fact that South Africa now has a nonsexist,
           nonracial, democratic Constitution, there are disturbing signs
           that racism still persists in our society;


       (c)  the lack of education and health for the vast majority of South
           Africans is a direct result of the structured and
           institutionalised racial oppression of the past;


       (d)  poverty has given rise to illiteracy, to a high incidence of
           pandemics such as HIV/Aids, tuberculosis, cholera and malaria,
           and to the general marginalisation of our people;


       (e)  we should effectively utilise national resources to confront
           these challenges and make all efforts to enhance the quality of
           the lives of our people;


  (2) supports the Millennium Statement on Racism and Programme of Action
       as adopted at the National Conference on Racism organised by the
       South African Human Rights Commission; and


  (3) resolves to declare 2001 to 2010 as the Decade for National
       Mobilisation against Racism.

Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, I move as an amendment:


  That paragraphs (2) and (3) be substituted by the following paragraphs:


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  the gap between rich and poor in South Africa is becoming wider;


       (b)  millions of South Africans live in poverty with all the social
           ills which poverty brings; and


       (c)  stunted physical and intellectual development of many of our
           children is a result of poverty;


  (3) finally notes that HIV/Aids poses a threat of enormous consequences,
       with the pandemic certain to cause the deaths of millions of people
       within the next decade; and


  (4) therefore resolves to declare the period 2001 to 2010 as the Decade
       for National Mobilisation against Racism, Poverty and Aids.

Amendment put.
Declaration of vote:

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, die Wes-Kaap stel hierdie amendement voor
omdat ons glo dat werklike nasiebou nie net berus op die eenvoudige konsep
dat indien rassisme uitgeroei word hemel op aarde sal neerdaal nie.
Welvaartskepping, onmiddellike optrede teen die verspreiding van Vigs en
die uitroei van rassisme sal eerder die glinsterskim van die reënboognasie
laat skyn as die etikettering en bemoddering van rassegroepe en spesifieke
boere.

Vir my ruik dit na die chaos in Zimbabwe. As die Wes-Kaap so sleg is,
waarom stroom duisende Suid-Afrikaners na hierdie provinsie, in so mate dat
ons departemente van onderwys, gesondheid en maatskaplike dienste steier
onder 'n dramatiese toename in aanvraag? Die rede is dat die ANC die
rassetamboer slaan omdat hulle faal in werkskepping, faal om Vigs vas te
vat, faal om 'n beter lewe vir al die mense te skep en net slaag om sommige
comrades te bevoordeel. Lippediens aan armoede, lippediens aan Vigs, twee
sake wat nie deel uitmaak van paragraaf (3) van die mosie nie, is nie vir
ons aanvaarbaar nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, the Western Cape is moving this amendment
because we believe that true nation-building is not just based on the
simple concept that if racism is eradicated there will be heaven on earth.
The creation of prosperity, immediate action against the spread of Aids and
the eradication of racism stand a better chance at letting the phantom
glitter of the rainbow nation shine than the labelling and besmirching of
racial groups and specific farmers.

To me this smells of the chaos in Zimbabwe. If the Western Cape is so bad,
why are thousands of South Africans flocking to this province, to the
extent that our departments of education, of health and of social services
are staggering under a dramatic increase in demand? The reason is that the
ANC is beating the drum of racism because they are failing at job creation,
failing to tackle Aids, failing to create a better life for all, and are
only succeeding in favouring some comrades. Lip-service to poverty, lip-
service to Aids, two issues that are not part of paragraph (3) of the
motion, are unacceptable to us.]

We say we should, in the words of President Mandela during a speech in
February 1996, bring out the best in all of us and, like our sportspeople,
perform better everywhere. We have to expand the economy and create jobs,
improve the quality of life for all, expand the frontiers of freedom and
ensure comprehensive security for all our citizens.

The provinces cast their votes as follows:


  AYES - 8: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, Kwazulu-Natal, Mpumalanga,
  Northern Cape, Northern Province, North West.


  NOES - 1: Western Cape.

Motion accordingly agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the
Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 16:28.
