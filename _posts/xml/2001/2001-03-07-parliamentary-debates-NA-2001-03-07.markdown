                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Dr J BENJAMIN: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the shocking and saddening news of a road accident involving
       South African teenage swimming champion, Natalie du Toit, which
       resulted in her leg being amputated;


  (2) expresses its sympathy towards this aspirant South African Olympian;
       and


  (3) wishes the girl a speedy recovery from her ordeal and offers her
       encouragement during these trying times.

[Applause.]

Dr J T DELPORT: Meneer die Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die DP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis, indien dit bewys word dat 'n Potchefstroomse boer gepoog
  het om van sy werknemers te vergiftig -


  (1) sy skok en afkeer in die sterkste taal uitspreek;


  (2) vra dat die SA Polisiediens die saak baie deeglik sal ondersoek; en


  (3) die plaaslike gemeenskap maan om selfbeheersing aan die dag te lê en
       nie onwettige stappe te doen nie,


  sodat die pogings, asook die sukses wat behaal is, om die
  kommunikasiegaping tussen boere en hul werknemers uit te wis nie daardeur
  geskaad word nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr J T DELPORT: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House, if it is proved that a Potchefstroom farmer attempted to
  poison some of his workers -


  (1) expresses its shock and disapproval in the strongest possible terms;


  (2) requests the SA Police Service to investigate the matter very
       thoroughly; and


  (3) cautions warns the local community to exercise self-control and not
       to take illegal steps,


  so that no harm is done to the attempts at, as well as success achieved
  in, bridging the communication gap between farmers and their employees.]

Inkosi M W HLENGWA: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Tioxide, a company operating in KwaZulu-Natal, has
       graciously offered to sponsor computers for the Amazibu Primary
       School in the Imfume Circuit;


  (2) congratulates Tioxide on its generous offer that will undoubtedly
       improve the education of our children;


  (3) notes that the Amazibu Primary School will not be able to accept the
       generous offer from Tioxide as there is no electricity at the school;


  (4) calls on the Government to accelerate its programme of rural
       electrification; and


  (5) further calls on Eskom to give priority to the electrification of
       rural schools.

Mr A R AINSLIE: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the destruction of the Buddha statues in Afghanistan;


  (2) further notes that the contributions made by the Buddha to the growth
       and development of civilisation were, are and will always remain
       salutary;


  (3) believes that the destruction of the statues of Gautama Buddha does
       not augur well for religious tolerance; and


  (4) deplores and condemns this action, and urges the Taliban government
       in Afghanistan to preserve and respect the cultural heritage of all
       religions in Afghanistan.

[Applause.]

Mr H A SMIT: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the growing internal political battle within the ANC, which has
       resulted in a shameful mudslinging campaign by the ANC against the
       former Mpumalanga premier Matthews Phosa, and that this is not an
       example of democracy;


  (2) together with the DA, wishes Mr Phosa every success in his legal
       actions against his former colleagues;


  (3) condemns the comments by ANC spokesperson, Jackson Mthemba, that Mr
       Phosa should rather have pursued the matter through party channels,
       and notes that this is further proof that the ANC regards its party
       as being superior to the state and notes that this attitude should be
       condemned, and is misplaced in our new democracy; and


  (4) notes that the DA calls on the Government to step up its fight
       against corruption in the light of Mr Phosa's statement that he has
       information at his disposal which reveals that corruption affects the
       uppermost echelons of ANC leadership.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, I would like to warn you again
that motions cannot be moved on behalf of the DA. There is no DA in the
House. You can only move a motion on behalf of your own party.

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) condemns with contempt the despicable actions of the farmer from
       Potchefstroom who allegedly poisoned 47 farmworkers;


  (2) notes that his actions can only be described as barbaric and that it
       cannot be imagined that any circumstances exist that can lead to such
       an inhumane act;


  (3) further notes that farmers, their families and farmworkers are
       already vulnerable and under threat of violent attacks, and believes
       that acts such as these perpetuate negative feelings and further
       destabilise an already volatile situation; and


  (4) calls on the farming community to condemn this violent act in the
       strongest possible terms and to distance itself from this type of
       inhumane action.

Mr M R BALOYI: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the Home for All Campaign is still being criticised by
       several members of the opposition, and that the Leader of the
       Opposition and his lieutenants have so far refused to sign the
       Declaration of Commitment, and are actively mobilising members of the
       white community to reject this campaign;


  (2) further notes that Cape Town academic Prof Wilmot James claims that
       the campaign is running out of steam;


  (3) believes that this is a negative view that is unhelpful and could be
       misconstrued as advocating inaction; and


  (4) calls on all South Africans to support the Home for All Campaign and
       congratulates Antjie Krog, Mary Burton, Carl Niehaus and other
       initiators of the campaign on their contribution to nation-building.

[Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Parliamentary Committee on Water Affairs and Forestry
           visited the Lesotho Highlands Water Project from 23 - 25
           February 2001;


       (b)  this large water scheme involving three dams at present is one
           of the success stories of Africa, involving two African
           countries; and


       (c)  our water requirements, particularly in Gauteng and parts of the
           Free State, may be fully met;


  (2) congratulates the Lesotho and South African planners, engineers,
       funders and workers involved in this project;


  (3) urges that the water needs of the people of Lesotho be urgently
       addressed; and


  (4) encourages the government of Lesotho to speed up the tourism
       potential of this project for the sake of the people of Lesotho and
       our entire Southern African region.

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Reserve Bank Governor, Mr Tito Mboweni, last week said
       that the political turmoil in Zimbabwe is still affecting South
       Africa's economy through its adverse effect on investor sentiment;


  (2) notes that, as a direct result of President Mbeki's change of
       attitude towards President Robert Mugabe, the rand/dollar exchange
       rate showed a positive change for a couple of days, but has since
       slipped back;


  (3) calls on President Mbeki to display a sense of urgency in putting
       South Africa's interests first by taking a brave and courageous stand
       against the President of Zimbabwe's disrespect for the justice
       system, his blatant disregard for the rule of law and his
       indifference towards human rights; and


  (4) therefore supports any active steps taken by President Mbeki which
       would positively influence the South African economy, and which would
       bring us on the high road of the African Renaissance and the
       Millennium African Recovery Programme.

Ms F I CHOHAN-KOTA: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the founding of an independent newspaper, ``The Swaziland
           Guardian'', in the Kingdom of Swaziland; and


       (b)  the intention of its founders to give untrammelled expression to
           democratic opinion emanating from all quarters, including civil
           society; and


  (2) congratulates the initiators of this project and expresses the hope
       that the newspaper will mark a turning point for the fostering of
       freedom of expression and democracy in that country.

[Applause.]

Ms S C VOS: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the assurances given recently in this House by the Minister for
       Justice and Constitutional Development that long-awaited legal
       assistance to the poorest of the poor in our land will soon be a
       reality within our system of justice;


  (2) anxiously awaits confirmation that this legal representation will
       finally be made available to the hundreds of thousands of women
       throughout South Africa who, daily, seek justice and assistance with
       regard to issues directly related to child maintenance; and


  (3) recognises that the present situation in which child maintenance
       defaulters can receive legal aid, and yet women seeking succour for
       their children cannot, is totally untenable.

Mr L M KGWELE: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the massive demonstrations in New York, Washington DC, and other
           cities of the USA in support of the South African Government's
           thrust to secure generic medicines in the teeth of opposition
           from the pharmaceutical multinational corporations;
       (b)  the international campaign undertaken by developing countries to
           secure affordable drugs for the poor; and


       (c)  an initiative by two US Senators to prevent the government of
           that country from taking punitive action against developing
           countries that import and manufacture generic drugs; and


  (2) expresses its consternation that opposition parties in this
       Parliament appear more concerned with promoting the interests of
       wealthy corporations than with the health of the poor in this
       country.

Dr P J RABIE: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes, with serious concern, an article published in The Economist of
       24 February 2001 (South African survey) stating: ``The United Nations
       expects the Aids epidemic to knock 0,3%-0,4% off the growth rate each
       year, making South Africa's GDP in 2010 17% or $22 billion lower then
       it would have been otherwise'';


  (2) calls on the Government to allow antiretroviral drugs such as AZT and
       Nevirapine to be made available in public hospitals;


  (3) acknowledges that if immediate proactive steps are not taken to
       address the serious threat that HIV/Aids poses to the entire fabric
       of South African society, some companies may lose 40%-50% of their
       skilled employees within the next 10 years; and


  (4) notes that a skilled healthy workforce is a crucial variable
       regarding the productive operation of sophisticated equipment in
       industry.

Mr S ABRAM: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay the continued disruption of postal services as a
       result of strike action;
  (2) condemns the incidents of violence that have been perpetrated, which
       the opposing sides are blaming each other for; and


  (3) urges both management and employees to resolve this matter in a
       responsible manner, remembering that collectively they are
       responsible for providing a vital service to the South African
       public.

Nkskz C I GCINA: Somlomo, ndenza esi siphakamiso egameni likaKhongolose:


  Sokuba le Ndlu -

  (5) ivuyisane nabantwana, ootitshala, abazali noluntu lwaseKhayamnandi
       jikelele ngalo msebenzi mhle kangaka.
(Translation of Xhosa notice of motion follows.)

[Mrs C I GCINA: Madam Speaker, I would like to propose the following on
behalf of the ANC:


  That this House -


  (1) notes with great joy and happiness that Khayamnandi Secondary School
       was chosen as one of the 15 schools whose matric results improved
       tremendously when compared to those of the previous year;


  (2) notes that those results rose from 54% to 76,4%;


  (3) notes that the pass rate in science subjects increased dramatically;


  (4) acknowledges that this is as a result of the efforts of the
       Department of Education and Minister Kader Asmal in ensuring that
       education is put at a standard that is acceptable; and


  (5) congratulates learners, teachers, parents and the general Khayamnandi
       community on a job well done.]

Mr P A GERBER: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with shock the unacceptable picture of a very skewed unchanging
           pattern of representivity in the public service in the Western
           Cape provincial administration;


       (b)  that the province has not reached the target prescribed by White
           Papers on affirmative action and transformation, public service
           regulations and the Employment Equity Act; and


       (c)  that the Western Cape is worst of all the provincial
           administrations in the country and that this situation cannot be
           tolerated at all ...

[Interjections.]


  (2) calls upon this DP-led province to take decisive steps immediately
       because this unfortunate situation impacts severely on service
       delivery and obscures our political agenda, as Government, of
       accelerating service delivery; and


  (3) calls upon the provincial government to take decisive and urgent
       steps to make the public service more gender sensitive and
       representative.

[Applause.]

                            CAPE ARGUS CYCLE TOUR

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr G Q M DOIDGES: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the annual Cape Argus Cycle Tour, which is amongst the
       most important sporting events on South Africa's sporting calendar,
       takes place on Sunday, 11 March 2001;


  (2) recognises that Ministers P M Lekota and M V Moosa, and many Members
       of Parliament from all parties, regularly participate in this
       gruelling 109-km cycling race, thereby making a positive contribution
       to our campaign "Getting the Nation to Play"; and


  (3) calls on Members of Parliament and other South Africans to join
       thousands of participants in this year's event and those in years to
       come.

Agreed to.

                              COMRADES MARATHON
                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  one of the most famous and greatest sporting events in South
           Africa, namely the Comrades Marathon, takes place on national
           Youth Day, 16 June 2001;


       (b)  this race stretches over 89 kilometres between Durban and
           Pietermaritzburg and last year celebrated its 75th anniversary;


       (c)  it has been described as the "ultimate human race" and binds
           together thousands of South Africans in a spirit of camaraderie;


       (d)  the participants share courage, commitment, endurance, joy,
           heartache, pain and pride; and


       (e)  in the year 2000 only one Member of Parliament started and
           completed the Comrades Marathon;


  (2) calls on all running-fit Members of Parliament to come forward and
       run the Comrades Marathon, if not on 16 June this year, then in 2002;
       and


  (3) is of the view that -


       (a)  it will be a wonderful occasion if Members of Parliament, men
           and women from various political parties and parliamentary
           committees, join thousands of South Africans who participate in
           this well-known ultramarathon; and


       (b)  it will demonstrate to our nation that MPs are not only fit to
           do their job well, but also physically and mentally fit to
           participate in such a tough event.

Agreed to.

The House adjourned at 17:24.
