             SA GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO TERRORIST ATTACK ON USA

                                 (Statement)

The SPEAKER: Order! I wish to advise the House that the Minister of  Foreign
Affairs has requested an opportunity to make a statement. I have  agreed  to
this. I understand the Chief Whip of the Majority Party  has  a  motion  for
the Order.
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  do  not  have  a
motion. I thought it was sufficient that the Minister made  the  request  to
you, and that you had granted her the opportunity to make  a  statement.  We
have  agreed  with  the  other  parties  that  we  will  give  ourselves  an
opportunity, as parties, to respond to the  statement,  probably  some  time
next week.

The SPEAKER: Order! The issue is really that I will allow  that  opportunity
before we take notices of motion.

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, hon  members,  comrades  and
friends, last week, on the fateful Tuesday, 11  September  2001,  the  whole
world watched with horror,  disbelief  and  shock  the  deplorable  acts  of
terror perpetrated against the United States  of  America  and  its  people.
These  carefully  calibrated  acts  of  terror,  which  maimed  and   killed
thousands  of  innocent  people   deserve   our   strong   and   unequivocal
condemnation.

We join the international community in expressing our heartfelt  condolences
and deepest sympathies to those who fell  victim  to  these  acts  by  these
faceless terrorists.  Our  Government  has  also  conveyed  its  message  of
support and sympathy to the president  and  the  government  of  the  United
States. Driven by our outrage at these unmitigated  acts  of  terror  and  a
spirit  of  solidarity,  the  people  in  our   country,   through   various
formations, have markedly demonstrated that the pain of the American  people
in their darkest hour is also ours. The response  of  the  public  has  been
overwhelming, as shown through church services and the signing of a book  of
condolences.

True to our character as South Africans, we collectively  responded  to  the
calamity that befell the people of  the  United  States.  Sadly,  there  are
still six South Africans who are not accounted for. Government, through  its
mission in the US, and working with the relevant United States  authorities,
is continuing to search for these South Africans who were  in  the  vicinity
of the affected area.
South Africa has a long history of struggle, but in  that  long  history  it
also has a long  history  of  adopting  a  policy  and  principle  of  anti-
terrorism. Even as we were struggling for freedom in this  country,  opposed
to the suppression and oppression of our people,  we  continued  to  make  a
distinction  between  military  targets  and  civilians.  Informed  by   the
morality of our  struggle,  we  always  resisted  the  temptation  of  using
violence indiscriminately against civilians.

South Africa and the South African  Government  condemns  terrorism  without
any equivocation.  Attacks  against  civilians  cannot  be  justified.  This
approach is integral to the humanitarian values that inspired  our  struggle
and governed its conduct. These principles inform the  core  values  of  our
Constitution.

South Africa therefore will co-operate with all  efforts  to  apprehend  the
culprits and bring them to book. Justice must be done, and must be  seen  to
be done. South Africa therefore recognises the right of  the  US  Government
to track down the culprits and bring them to justice. Any action  should  be
informed by a thorough investigation and proper targeting of the culprits.

In his conversation with our  President  Thabo  Mbeki  yesterday  afternoon,
President Bush of the United States conveyed best wishes to  the  people  of
South Africa and thanked them for their response to the tragedy that  befell
the American people. Again, in their  conversation,  they  agreed  that  the
issue of terrorism needs to be confronted by all countries, but  has  to  be
approached in a calm and cool-headed manner.

 The two Presidents also agreed that this  fight  against  terrorism  should
not be seen as a fight against any religion, culture or race and as  an  act
of collective punishment or collective guilt. They agreed that  they  should
make every effort to ensure  that  whatever  is  done  is  directed  at  the
perpetrators and the terrorists. They also  agreed  that  the  world  should
unite in a coalition against terrorism, that this coalition  still  needs  a
serious discussion and that a lot of inputs are needed to define  and  shape
it.

In this regard we also, as South Africans, would like  to  condemn  acts  of
violence perpetrated against any particular group and  any  particular  race
in this  country.  Coming  from  the  successful  World  Conference  against
Racism, any acts that are directed at any particular people on the basis  of
their colour, race, religion or faith should be opposed as  this  will  play
into the hands  of  the  wicked  forces  that  are  committing  these  acts.
Islamophobia, anti-Arabism, anti-Semitism and any other  form  of  prejudice
and discrimination must be eliminated from our society.

The South African Government  has  been  approached  by  the  United  States
Government  for  assistance  and  for  co-operation  in  tracking  down  the
perpetrators of terrorist acts. The assistance that we have  been  asked  to
render is in line with what we have been doing and what we would like to  do
in combating crimes such as terrorism. And  we  are  co-operating  with  the
United States government and all other governments in doing what we need  to
do to eradicate terrorism.

We are also aware that in the long term it would be important  that  we  pay
attention to the role of the United Nations and how the  UN  should  itself,
as an agent of collective  security,  be  involved  in  this  fight  against
terrorism. We  would  like  to  see  the  UN  taking  this  as  one  of  its
priorities.

The South African Government has not considered any military involvement  in
the operations envisaged. We have not been  asked  to  render  any  military
assistance and the matter has not even arisen. So,  within  the  context  of
our approach both to immediate and long-term challenges in dealing with  the
scourge of terrorism, the issue has not arisen.

Lastly, I would like to say we will, as the Government of South Africa,  and
also as  part  of  the  international  community,  remain  seized  with  the
developments both in the United States and  the  world  over,  and  we  will
commit whatever we need to commit to fight against the scourge of  terrorism
in our country.

I would like to express the  Government's  appreciation  to  the  people  of
South Africa for the way they have responded  to  the  tragedy  of  enormous
proportions  that  befell  the  people  of  the  United  States  last  week.
[Applause.]

       magistrates; and


  (3) calls on President Mbeki to intervene in the salary  dispute  between
       state attorneys and the Department of Justice, as the  situation  has
       reached the point where the officials of his department have  clearly
       lost confidence in the Minister, and the Minister clearly  lacks  the
       will, ability or competence to deal with the matter.

[Applause.]

Mrs I MARS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:

       reported in the Sowetan of 18 September 2001, entitled ``Too  soon  a
       Mother";


  (2)  recognises  that  a  number  of  factors   contribute   to   teenage
       pregnancies, including  poverty,  economic  disparity,  dysfunctional
       families,   a   lack   of   education,   urban   migration,    gender
       discrimination, erosion of spiritual values and irresponsible  sexual
       behaviour;


  (3) notes that pregnant girls are often  ostracised  and  stigmatised  by
       classmates and communities, which often result in high dropout  rates
       from schools;


  (4) further notes that children born to teenage girls are at high risk of
       infant mortality and malnutrition and are at an even greater risk  of
       neglect; and


  (5) calls on the Minister of Education to speed up the inclusion  of  the
       subject of sexuality in the curriculum.

Mr K A MOLOTO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:

       foreign visitors  to  investigate  investment  opportunities  in  the
       Southern African region;


  (3) further believes that this exhibition reflects the commitment of  the
       ANC-led Government to economic growth and development of the  region;

day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:

           employers R160 million in  lost  turnover  and  R16  million  in
           wages; and


       (b)  Dumisa Ntuli stated that the  four-week  strike  had  been  very
           successful, even though 5,88 million people in South Africa find
           themselves without work;


  (2) calls upon the Government to encourage labour and industry to do  all
       that is possible to avert strikes and to negotiate wage disputes in a
       responsible manner; and


  (3) acknowledges that foreign direct investment  is  a  prerequisite  for
       sustained economic growth and  may  be  diverted  to  other  emerging
       markets if wage disputes are not settled.

Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:

       Cabinet and Parliament for an increase in social grants and pensions;


  (2) notes the Minister's acknowledgement of the economic burden resulting
       from the impact of HIV/Aids, which  adds  to  the  mounting  evidence
       placed before the President against his false logic;


  (3) further notes that theft and corruption in the department  should  be
       eradicated, thereby saving the department huge amounts of money  that
       could be used to alleviate the suffering of the poor; and


  (4) calls on the Government to analyse priorities carefully  to   reflect
       the needs of the people properly.

Mrs M P COETZEE-KASPER: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the

  (2) applauds Minister Skweyiya for  actively  pursuing  the  Government's
       Integrated Rural Strategy Development Plan; and
  (3) supports initiatives by the Government to  combat  poverty  in  rural
       areas.

                       HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, hon members, this  Bill  has  been
extensively discussed in the portfolio committee, and its chairperson,  Prof
Mayatula will analyse it in detail. I would like,  with  the  permission  of
hon members, to refer to some basic principles underlying these amendments.
As I indicated in our review of education since  1994,  the  nature  of  the
debate in education and the focus of attention has shifted  to  delivery  on
the policies that we have put in place. In April this year I tabled  in  the
House  the  National  Plan  for  Higher  Education,   which   provides   the
Government's blueprint for  the  fundamental  restructuring  of  the  higher
education system. I need not remind hon  members  that  the  end  result  of
restructuring is to enable the establishment of a  higher  education  system
that  is  sustainable,  of  high  quality,  contributes  to   the   national
reconstruction and development agenda, particularly the  Government's  human
resource development agenda, and enables greater  access  to  the  education
system. The national plan, I am pleased to report, has met  with  widespread
support both within and outside the higher education system.

The few voices that have come out in opposition to the national plan  -  and
I am sure that the House is familiar with these from  the  press  reports  -
are largely driven by narrow, personal and institutional interests.
The worldwide experience is  that  large-scale  educational  change  is  not
without pain. There already is and there will be  much  contestation  around
the restructuring processes. Vigorous debate about the form  and  nature  of
new institutions, new academic programmes and new research  areas  can  only
enrich  the  process.  This  is  what  higher  education  thrives  on   and,
particularly, on freedom of speech and a free flow of ideas. However,  there
is no place for narrow personal agendas, which have the potential to  derail
progress.  I  want  to  assure  the  House  that  we  will  not  allow   our
transformation agenda to be either sidetracked or ambushed.

I am also pleased to  inform  the  House  that  the  implementation  of  the
national plan  is  on  target.  The  various  working  groups  that  I  have
established facilitate implementation, are hard at work  and  are  committed
to meeting the very tight deadlines set  in  the  national  plan.  My  final
proposals for institutional restructuring will be with the Cabinet early  in
the new year. But I  must  advise  the  House  that  we  may  have  to  take
provisional measures because of crises that  one  or  two  institutions  are
facing at  present.  In  the  meanwhile,  those  mergers  announced  in  the
national plan are proceeding apace.

The main purpose of the introduction of this amending Bill  is  to  help  in
the implementation of the restructuring of the  institutional  landscape  of
higher education, in particular institutional mergers  as  outlined  in  the
national  plan.  In  this  regard,  the  amending  Bill  provides  for   the
establishment of interim councils to facilitate the creation of  new  public
higher education institutions resulting from  the  merger  of  one  or  more
existing institutions.

The need for interim councils is precisely to ensure  the  creation  of  new
South African  higher  education  institutions,  based  on  the  values  and
principles of nonracism and democracy. This is  the  case  in  the  proposed
mergers of the M L Sultan Technikon and the Natal  Technikon,  and  that  of
Unisa, Technikon SA and the distance education centre of  Vista  University,
which are in process. These  must  not  be  held  to  ransom  by  particular
interests, whether they are individual or institutional.

The  interim  councils  have  a  very  specific  function  and   cannot   be
constituted  along  traditional   lines   where   one   has   constituencies
representing  workers,  business,  alumni,  the  academic  staff   and   the
administration staff.  This  was  particularly  the  point  raised  by  some
constituencies and the DA, which suggested this in the deliberations in  the
portfolio committee. I would have thought, I would like to say  to  the  hon
Boy Geldenhuys, that this elementary logic would have found  some  place  in
the DA. But then, I suppose, we would be  asking  too  much  of  the  DA  to
understand logic, elementary or otherwise, or  even  good  manners,  as  not
reflected by the Leader of the Opposition in his response to the tragedy  in
New York.

Properly constituted and functioning university and technikon  councils  are
essential to the success and good governance of higher education.  They  are
trusted by the public to  ensure  that  the  higher  education  institutions
discharge their teaching and research mandates, and that they  do  so  in  a
responsible and accountable manner.

However, good governance seems to elude a number  of  our  higher  education
institutions,  which  are  bedevilled  by  conflict  and   tension   between
management and councils to the detriment of their academic  and  educational
functions. This is illustrated by the fact  that  in  the  recent  past  two
university councils have been dissolved.

Therefore, the Bill seeks to fill a major gap  in  the  Act,  which,  as  it
stands,  does  not  provide  a  mechanism  for  the  legal  dissolution   of
institutional councils, which  are  unable  to  discharge  their  legal  and
fiduciary responsibilities. I am particularly concerned that  some  councils
are not acting as vigorously as they should in combating  corruption  within
institutions, and within the council itself.

In this regard, I want to highlight the growing  public  concern  about  the
blatant abuse, by some councils, of public  trust  through  the  payment  of
exorbitant honoraria and fees to council members. Indeed,  there  are  cases
that have come to my notice which indicate that the payment  earned  from  a
council membership is so high as to render it unnecessary for an  individual
to seek gainful employment outside the service he  or  she  performs  within
the council. One must remember that in the council, membership is  a  matter
of public duty.

This cannot continue. It is my responsibility to  ensure  that  councils  do
not abuse the public trust. I have therefore indicated to all  institutional
councils that no member should be paid more than  R1  000  per  meeting.  If
councils do not adhere to this and continue with the current practice,  then
I should give advance warning that I will  have  to  consider  amending  the
Higher Education Act to regulate payment in line with strict  guidelines  to
be determined by the Minister of Education.

One cannot invoke academic or  university  autonomy  to  justify  greed  and
avarice.  In  focusing  on  the  problems  and  difficulties  that  confront
councils in some institutions, we should at the same  time  not  forget  the
many councils which carry out  their  responsibilities  with  the  necessary
commitment and probity. I want to salute the many men  and  women  from  all
walks of life, who give of their expertise and time so  willingly  to  serve
on these councils.

The extension of the period to two years, for which  the  administrator  can
be  appointed  to  manage  a  university,  has  been  necessitated  by   our
experience with the two  universities  where  administrators  are  currently
being appointed. Members will recall that to appoint  an  administrator  is,
in fact, to do something in a dysfunctional institution. I  am  particularly
pleased with the progress that has been made this year at the University  of
the  North,  where  teaching  and  research  are  now  taking  place   under
conditions  of  peace  and  tranquillity.  The  campus  has  therefore  been
stabilised for the first time in a decade. Its reorganisation is  proceeding
very well, but it will take longer than one year to  achieve  the  functions
and the aims that we have in mind.

I now want to turn to an aspect of the Bill which had some  members  jumping
up and down as if they had ants in their pants. I refer  to  the  repeal  of
the private Acts of the universities. The DA, I am sure, will  portray  this
- logic and common sense are not necessarily their  forte  -  as  a  further
intrusion on institutional autonomy and academic freedom. This could not  be
further from the truth. [Interjections.] I want to tell the  hon  Geldenhuys
that academic freedom  and  institutional  autonomy  are  protected  by  the
Constitution -  not  institutional  autonomy,  but  academic  freedom.  That
institutional  autonomy  is  protected  by  the  Higher  Education  Act   is
precisely because of the far-reaching provisions  of  the  Higher  Education
Act, including the guarantee of  institutional  autonomy  that  renders  the
private Acts no more than symbols of a past in which institutional  autonomy
was observed  by  some  and  their  nationalist  bedfellows  in  the  breach
thereof.

The leadership of higher education institutions support the  repeal  of  the
private Acts. The Bill also takes a further step in the establishment  of  a
single, national, co-ordinated higher  education  system  through  repealing
the  Certification  Council  for  Technikon  Education,   which   has   been
responsible  for  quality  assurance  functions  in  the  technikons.   This
function has now been taken over by the Higher Education  Quality  Committee
of the Council on Higher Education for the entire higher education system  -
that is, both universities and technikons - thus bringing quality  assurance
under one umbrella, possibly the first time anywhere, in any country in  the
world.

I want to thank members and the portfolio committee  for  their  work.  This
Bill seeks to strengthen the regulation of higher  education  and  takes  us
closer to achieving the goal of a single, national, co-ordinated  system  of
higher education. It also marks the process of cleaning  up  legislation.  I
commend this Bill to the House. [Applause.]

Mr R S NTULI: Madam Speaker, hon  Ministers  and  hon  members,  I  want  to
emphasise that the DP accepts and cherishes the fact that transformation  of
the higher education system is not only necessary, but also not  negotiable.
That is the issue, and this issue will not be delayed, we  accept  that.  We
also appreciate that transformation must reflect the  changes  taking  place
in our society and strengthen the  values  and  practices  of  democracy  to
serve our new social order.

Transformation of higher education must not only meet our pressing  national
needs, but also respond to modern realities and, in particular, redress  the
past. The Higher Education Act, the subject of this amendment,  attempts  to
establish a  legislative  framework  for  the  creation  of  a  single,  co-
ordinated system of higher  education  comprising  universities,  technikons
and colleges. This Act charges  the  Minister  with  the  responsibility  of
determining higher education policy after consultation with the  Council  on
Higher Education.

In a very emotionally charged debate, the  DP  in  particular,  opposed  the
passage of the Act mentioned above, arguing that, while the Bill -  and  the
corresponding White Paper - recognised the right  to  academic  freedom  and
institutional autonomy, the Minister  would,  in  future,  be  empowered  to
virtually determine the priorities of higher education.

The DP essentially challenged the centralisation of power in  the  hands  of
the Minister and the controlling body. Four years after the passage  of  the
principal Act, the Higher Education Act, we are now faced with  the  present
Higher Education Amendment Bill in conditions  and  circumstances  not  very
dissimilar.

The Bill seeks to amend the Higher Education Act substantively by  repealing
private Acts of  universities,  which  essentially  means  that  the  Higher
Education  Act  will  be  the  only  legal  instrument  pertaining  to   the
universities. We have no problem with that,  essentially.  After  all,  even
the universities have indicated that most of these Acts are just symbolic.

In relation to  the  repeal  of  the  Certification  Council  for  Technikon
Education, the  Higher  Education  Quality  Committee  will  take  over  the
functions of the Certification Council for Technikon Education. We  have  no
problem with that either.

In relation to the establishment of interim councils for  new,  declared  or
merged public institutions, in the case of  a  merger,  an  interim  council
will be established for  the  new  institution.  Both  the  chairperson  and
members will be appointed by the Minister.

It is this third objective of the amendment Bill that, to us,  is  a  matter
of concern. [Interjections.] We have a right to feel that  way,  whether  or
not the members say ``oh''. We submit that the Government has two  functions
in respect of the provision of higher education, namely that the  Government
should establish a system for the provision of higher  education,  and  that
the Government should do so in a fair and transparent manner.

This  point  of  necessity  results  in  tension  between   the   claim   to
institutional autonomy and the limitation imposed by the  accountability  to
the Government for  the  funding  that  it  provides.  Consequently,  higher
education institutional autonomy or  maintaining  that  the  institution  is
accountable solely to itself in all its decisions, would ignore the  reality
of its existence as a social institution, funded largely by the  Government.
Therefore,  higher   education   institutions   recognise   legitimate   and
reasonable restrictions to their autonomy.

The amendment to sections 20, 21 and 23 of the principal  Act  provides  for
interim structures, namely the council and management, in the event  of  the
establishment,  declaration   or   merger   of   public   higher   education
institutions. If passed, this Bill will put a final end to a long  tradition
in the South African university  environment,  namely  that  Parliament,  by
legislation, brings life and death to universities. Henceforth,  this  power
will rest  solely  with  the  executive.  Parliament's  direct  say  becomes
indirect  control,  via  the  accountability  of  the   executive   to   the
legislature.

As the Act stands, the  establishment,  declaration  and  merger  of  public
higher education institutions are at the sole discretion  of  the  Minister,
subject only to consultation with  the  Council  on  Higher  Education.  The
members of the Council on Higher Education are appointed  by  the  Minister,
as referred to in section 8(4). The Minister need not follow the  advice  of
the Council on Higher Education, provided written reasons are given  to  the
CHE for the nonacceptance of the advice.

The DP's main concern is that without proper guidance  for  the  discretion,
the  proposed  provision  for  an  interim   council   and   management   of
institutions to be merged fails  to  appreciate  institutional  autonomy  of
public higher education institutions. It allows the Minister too  much  room
for  interference  in  the  governance  of  established  institutions   and,
ultimately, the possibility of the abuse of discretion on the  part  of  the
Minister.

What appears to be merely an administrative mechanism in the  hands  of  the
Minister can  turn  into  a  powerful  political  weapon  or  instrument  of
pressure. The amendments put forward by the DA  were  aimed  at  putting  in
place a few checks and  balances  on  ministerial  power.  Such  substantive
amendments, though few, were rejected by the ruling party.

The ANC keeps on telling us that none of its  Ministers  will  abuse  power.
This obviously cannot be taken for  granted.  We  accept  that  the  present
Minister, being a man of integrity, will, in all  probability,  not  do  so.
But what about the next Minister?

This piece of legislation will obviously be passed by  this  Parliament  for
obvious reasons. But we  as  the  DP  wish  to  register  our  objection  by
opposing the Bill. [Applause.]

Prof S M MAYATULA: Madam Speaker, hon ministers, hon members, I  would  like
to take this opportunity to thank all the different  stakeholders  who  made
valuable  submissions  before  the  portfolio  committee.  Based  on   their
submissions and the committee's close scrutiny of the  Bill,  I  thought  we
would  be  coming  before  this  House  speaking  the  same  language,   but
unfortunately, it was not to be.

The DP and the New NP decided to vote  against  the  Bill  on  two  grounds:
Firstly,  that  the  Bill,  they  allege,  tampers  with  the  autonomy   of
universities, and, secondly, that they are against  the  repeal  of  private
Acts.

In both instances they are not representing the views  of  higher  education
institutions  of  this  country,  but  themselves.  In  both  their  written
submissions and presentations before the committee, the SA  University  Vice
Chancellors' Association, SAUVCA, the Committee of Technikon Principals  and
the  Association  of  Vice   Chancellors   of   Historically   Disadvantaged
Institutions of South Africa supported the Bill.

SAUVCA in its submission, had this to say - it was not me, or the  ANC,  but
a representative of SAUVCA - and I quote:


  SAUVCA supports the policies and principles embedded in the  Bill.  While
  SAUVCA has reservations about the repeal of private Acts because  of  the
  symbolism involved in their repeal and the effect of  this  symbolism  on
  university autonomy ...

I will underline the next -


  ... SAUVCA accepts that there are both good  and  practical  reasons  for
  these changes, and also that the level of  autonomy  that  public  higher
  education institutions enjoy, which is not absolute, is provided  for  by
  the Constitution and Higher Education Act, and not by the private Acts.

Prof Itumeleng Mosala of the ASAHDI had this to say:


  The  Association  of  Vice  Chancellors  of  Historically   Disadvantaged
  Institutions  of  SA  feels  that  one  could  not  protect  autonomy  of
  universities through private Acts. Autonomy was already entrenched in the
  White Paper on Higher Education. It is the Government's policy  to  allow
  institutions to have autonomy and academic freedom.

What more can one say? The stakeholders have spoken.

The main objective of the Bill  is  to  provide  for  the  establishment  of
interim councils  for  new,  declared  or  merged  public  higher  education
institutions whose role will be to perform the  functions  relating  to  the
governance of the  institutions,  except  the  making  of  an  international
statute. They should also, according to clause 3(10),  firstly,  appoint  an
interim body of three to  manage  day-to-day  activities;  secondly,  ensure
that  a  council  is  constituted;  and,  lastly,  ensure  that  such  other
structures contemplated in section 33(3) are constituted.

The committee's understanding is that the interim council is just  that,  an
interim structure whose main task is to ensure  that  the  real  council  is
established. They are there to bridge a gap. They should not pretend  to  be
the real council. They should aim  to  accomplish  their  tasks  within  six
months and then leave the stage.  The  extension  of  their  term,  if  any,
should be the exception rather than the rule.

The following are some of the submissions which were  not  approved  by  the
committee - except the DA, of course. My colleagues will  elaborate  on  our
reasons. My task is to give the broad thinking of the committee.

Firstly,  it  was  proposed  that  the  interim  councils  should   not   be
obligatory. If we agree that the interim councils are there to bridge a  gap
and bring together already existing institutions, each with its  own  vested
interests and baggage,  such  structures  cannot  be  expected  to  be  both
referees and players. It is only an  interim  council  that  can  play  that
role, if only to safeguard the interests of the weaker parties. We  must  be
proactive, and rule out any possibility  of  any  problems  by  establishing
these interim councils.
Secondly, it was proposed that interim councils must  be  representative  of
the institutions concerned. As indicated above,  by  its  very  nature,  the
task of bringing together new, declared or merged institutions needs a  team
of objective members without any direct links with the said institutions.

I want to inform the hon Ntuli that it is of vital importance to  note  that
the role of the interim council is not to  negotiate  the  establishment  of
new institutions or the declaration or merging of old institutions. That  is
going to follow a different path. Their role is  mainly  to  facilitate  the
establishment of the council and other institutional structures.

Let us also remember that even the four  members  which  the  Minister  must
appoint are, according to clause  5(8)(a),  from  the  nominations  received
from the public institutions themselves. More  importantly,  the  three  co-
opted members of the interim management body come from the  institutions  of
higher education concerned. In that case, the interests of the  institutions
concerned are represented in the interim council.

Thirdly, it was proposed that interim councils should  be  allowed  to  make
institutional statutes. The making of  institutional  statutes  is,  by  its
very nature, a  long  and  involved  process  which  cannot  necessarily  be
accomplished within six months. It needs the involvement of a fully  fledged
and well constituted council with a long-term vision and commitment  to  the
institution. Surely, such an important  task  cannot  be  undertaken  by  an
interim  structure.  We  should  also  take  cognisance  of  the  fact  that
institutions of higher education do not make  institutional  statutes  every
year. It would be unwise to choose the  transitional  period  to  make  such
statutes.

Fourthly, it was proposed that the provision that the resignation of 75%  or
more of the members of a council at a meeting of that council, would  result
in the council being deemed to have resigned, should be based on  the  total
membership  of  the  council.  This  proposed  amendment  addresses  special
circumstances where in actual fact 75% or more  of  council  members,  in  a
formally constituted meeting, decide to resign.

Experience on the ground shows that those members who  did  not  attend  the
said meeting tend to feel that they are not bound by  such  decisions,  thus
leaving  the  institutions  in  limbo,  with  a  crippling  effect  on   the
governance of the institutions. Other  forms  of  resignations  are  already
covered in other laws.

Despite the repeal of the private Acts, the committee approved that  section
3(4) to (6) of the University of Cape Town Act of 1999,  continue  to  exist
as if the Act has not been repealed.  In  the  light  of  submissions  made,
clause 24 - on section 65A of the Act - has been adjusted to leave  out  the
term ``research'' in the determination of the  seat  of  an  institution  of
higher education.

Some stakeholders feel there is a need to give more power to  the  portfolio
committee to intervene in the department. I want to  refer  members  to  the
Rules of the National Assembly, in particular Rule 201(1)(c), which states:


  A portfolio committee may monitor, investigate,  enquire  into  and  make
  recommendations  concerning  any   such   executive   organ   of   state,
  constitutional institution or other body or  institution,  including  the
  legislative   programme,    budget,    rationalisation,    restructuring,
  functioning, organisation, structure, staff and policies of such organ of
  state ...

Given such power, what can the Minister do on  which  we  as  the  portfolio
committee cannot call him to order? Section 92(3) of our  Constitution  goes
a step further:


  Members of the Cabinet must -


  (b) provide Parliament with full and regular reports  concerning  matters
       under their control.

If there is anything that the Minister does it behoves  Parliament,  through
this committee, to call him to order. This Bill  in  no  way  reduces  those
powers. Parliament, through  its  committees,  if  it  is  to  exercise  its
oversight role objectively, must not be expected to be involved in the  day-
to-day administration of the departments.

The ANC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Chairperson, politics have  often  been  defined  as  the
authoritative  allocation  of  values  for  the  whole  of  society.  Higher
education institutions, universities in particular, come about as  a  result
of the needs of society, and as such are part  of  society.  When  the  core
values of that society  change,  the  character  and  the  mission  of  that
society's institutions must, of necessity, reflect that change. Perhaps  the
question one might rhetorically ask is, whose function  it  is  to  allocate
these values for this society.

The policy developments in the higher education sector have been  driven  by
a concern to establish  a  single,  national,  integrated  and  co-ordinated
system,  hence  the  Higher  Education  Act  of  1997  and  the   subsequent
amendments  to  the  principal  Act.  Obviously,  during  this  process   of
transforming the  higher  education  sector  from  a  disjointed  to  a  co-
ordinated unified system, there may be some casualties. What  is  important,
though,  is  to  weigh  these  casualties  against  the  values   that   the
legislation aims to achieve.

The values of uniformity, access, equity and  redress  are  central  to  the
Bill we are debating today. We must point out  that  at  one  phase  of  the
policy formulation one or two of these values will dominate, and at  another
phase another will be emphasised. The fact that one policy places one  value
at centre stage does not mean that the other values are insignificant.

I was particularly taken aback when, at the last hour - and,  of  course,  I
am using the words ``last hour'' both figuratively and literally  -  the  DP
and the New NP, who came an hour late to the  portfolio  committee  meeting,
announced that they were opposing not only certain clauses of the Bill,  but
the whole Bill. [Interjections.] The reasons that were put  forward  by  the
New NP and the DP were,  firstly,  that  it  gave  too  much  power  to  the
Minister and, secondly,  that  it  was  taking  away  the  autonomy  of  the
institutions.

Lest we debate past one another, let me restate the main objectives  of  the
Bill, namely to amend the Higher Education Act of 1997 so as to provide  for
the following: Firstly, the  establishment  of  interim  councils  for  new,
declared or merged  public  higher  education  institutions;  secondly,  the
dissolution of the council of a public higher education institution  if  75%
or more of the members resign, and for the constitution of  a  new  council;
thirdly, the repeal of the Certification  Council  for  Technikon  Education
Act of 1986; and fourthly, the repeal of the universities' private Acts  and
certain obsolete Acts.

The IFP is in support of these broad objectives of the  Bill.  This  is  the
question  that  arises:  Does  the  repeal  of  private  Acts  represent  an
infringement of the autonomy of the  institutions  of  higher  learning?  We
must note that most universities have been  using  private  Acts  that  were
passed  during  the  apartheid  era.  Some   of   these   Acts   established
universities on the basis of colour. [Interjections.] I  am  sure  that  the
hon member over there agrees with me. Should we therefore retain these  Acts
in the name of autonomy?

The SA University Vice Chancellors' Association felt,  in  their  submission
to the portfolio committee, that the repeal of the private Acts did  not  in
fact infringe upon the autonomy  of  the  universities.  They  said,  and  I
quote:


  SAUVCA accepts that there are both good and practical reasons  for  these
  changes, and also that the level  of  autonomy  that  the  public  higher
  education institutions enjoy, which is not absolute, is provided  for  by
  the Constitution and Higher Education Act, and not ...

May I repeat -


  ... not by the private Acts.

We cannot but agree with SAUVCA. What is more, clause 26 of the Bill,  which
deals with the transitional arrangements concerning  universities,  provides
that those matters contained in the private Acts that are not dealt with  in
the principal Act or institutional statutes will remain in the private  Acts
for a period of not longer that two years. These matters must,  however,  be
matters which are indispensable for the running of a university.

I wish, in conclusion, to go back to the argument that this Bill  gives  too
much power to the Minister. Well, we wish to submit upfront that it  is  not
the  Minister's  business  to  run  the  day-to-day  activities  of   higher
learning. This must be left to the institutions and their councils.

Section 20 of the principal Act provides for universities to be  established
by an Act of Parliament. According to the new Bill,  this  power  now  rests
with the Minister, who must consult with the Council for  Higher  Education,
which is a statutory body. In the past each  time  a  university  wanted  to
effect some changes, it had to rush to Parliament. This time around it  will
not be necessary.

If one speaks of university autonomy, the Bill  does  in  fact  enhance  the
autonomy of these institutions. Just imagine, in the 100  laws  or  Acts  of
universities that need to be passed, a university being expected to rush  to
Parliament each time it wants to effect  a  change.  That  would  limit  the
autonomy of those institutions, which  is  contradictory  to  what  the  hon
members to my left are saying. [Interjections.]

The Bill also allows the Minister  to  appoint  interim  councils  from  the
nominations submitted to him by the merging  institutions.  We  accept  this
ministerial role as an interim  measure  aimed  at  transformation  and  co-
ordination of institutions of higher learning. It must  be  remembered  that
one of the merging institution may not have had a  council.  Therefore,  for
purposes of uniformity and administrative justice, it is right that  members
of the interim council be appointed by the Minister.

However, we would have wanted to see a provision in the Bill which  provides
for the removal of dysfunctional councils. As long  as  the  Bill  does  not
infringe on the autonomy of institutions and as long as institutions  retain
the freedom and powers to make their own decisions,  the  IFP  will  support
this Bill.

In conclusion, I must say that I never saw the submissions  of  the  DP  and
the New  NP.  All  they  did  was  to  depend  on  the  submissions  of  the
stakeholders. [Interjections.] There were no formal  submissions  that  were
submitted by these parties. [Interjections.] I am surprised,  therefore,  to
hear them say that they submitted their proposals.

The IFP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Mr Chairperson, thank  heavens  there  are  parties  that
still listen to the inputs by experts! [Applause.] Yes,  we  did  listen  to
the stakeholders and we did base our amendments on  the  proposals  made  by
the stakeholders because that was the very purpose of the  public  hearings.
[Interjections.]

The previous speaker accused the DP and the New NP of being late during  the
final discussions. [Interjections.] Yes, we were, but it was due to  a  very
genuine misunderstanding. We attended  all  the  public  hearings.  We  were
there in the informal discussions and we were  the  only  two  parties  that
actually proposed amendments. The hon member of the IFP sat through all  the
hearings and discussions and did  not  come  up  with  a  single  amendment.
[Interjections.]

I want to thank the hon Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on  Education
for the very  unbiased  and  efficient  manner  in  which  he  conducts  the
meetings of the portfolio committee. I would like to say to him:  Thank  you
very much.

The hon  the  Minister  accused  the  DA  of  not  understanding  the  basic
principles of logic. Now, yes, we may be unlogical, but fortunately  we  are
not undemocratic. Therefore, we  still  believe  that  democratic  processes
should  be  pursued  even  in  the  composition  of  an   interim   council.
[Interjections.] And, yes, that was not originally our proposal, it was  the
proposal of Nehawu and we thought it was a very good one. [Interjections.]

The New NP opposes the  Higher  Education  Amendment  Bill.  The  underlying
point of departure, which led to the amending Bill, is flawed. The  tendency
to increase ministerial discretionary powers  to  promote  effectiveness  of
administration of the higher  education  institutions  is  unacceptable  and
erodes institutional autonomy. According to the Oxford  English  Dictionary,
autonomy means control over one's own affairs. I am  not  referring  to  the
private Acts.

The provisions of this Bill constitute everything  but  control  over  one's
own affairs. On the contrary, they constitute ministerial control  over  the
affairs of higher education institutions. Legislation is not the  answer  to
every managerial problem that may  arise  at  a  specific  institution.  One
simply  does  not  legislate  for  the  exception  to  the  rule,  one  only
legislates for the rule. [Interjections.]

It must also be pointed out that the public  hearings  were  a  make-believe
exercise. Yes, the chairperson welcomed the stakeholders but it was a  make-
believe exercise. Twenty-two amendments were proposed by experts. Only  two,
dealing with two minor technicalities, were accepted.  Surely  the  hon  the
Minister and the department cannot have all the wisdom in store.

The New NP furthermore opposes the Bill for the very same  reason  we  voted
against the principal Act  in  1997.  Too  much  power  was  vested  in  the
Minister and this is not ad hominem. We think the  hon  the  Minister  is  a
good Minister. It is ad rem. But too much power was vested in the  Minister.
He could, of his own accord - and he can still do so  -  establish,  declare
and merge higher education institutions without really being accountable  to
anyone. If one aspect of the principal  Act  needs  to  be  amended,  it  is
undoubtedly the unfettered discretionary powers of the Minister.

Parliament should at least - this was also proposed by one of the experts  -
provide the Minister with guidelines on  the  exercise  of  the  ministerial
discretion concerning the establishment, declaration and  merger  of  public
higher education institutions. The vast powers of the Minister  embodied  in
the principal Act are simply perpetuated in the amending Bill. For  example,
it will be possible for the Minister, in terms  of  clause  5,  to  exercise
control over a merged institution for a full year - there was  reference  to
this earlier - because he not only appoints the chairperson of  the  interim
council, but also appoints the members although they are  nominated  by  the
institution.

Another cause for concern which emanates from the principal Act is the  lack
of consultation with the councils of those institutions which are  earmarked
for possible mergers. If a merger is to succeed for whatever  good  reasons,
it  will  have  to  carry  the  unconditional  support  of  the  institution
involved. One cannot simply ride roughshod over them.

During the visit of the portfolio  committee  to  various  universities,  it
became clear that some of these institutions experienced the modus  operandi
of  the  working  group  appointed  by  the  hon  the   Minister   to   make
recommendations  on  possible  mergers  in  a  very   negative   way.   They
experienced the working  group  as  being  arrogant,  prescriptive  and  not
prepared to listen to alternative proposals. One must not underestimate  the
capability and willingness of these institutions to rationalise, to cut  out
duplication and to work together in such a manner  that  huge  cost  savings
can be achieved. The hon the Minister should keep on  talking  to  them  and
not use the big stick.

Institutions with severe financial constraints have,  under  new  management
and over a short period of time, demonstrated their  capability  effectively
to manage themselves out of the financial ditch of the  past  few  years.  A
last request in this regard: the hon the Minister should not  be  too  harsh
on the historically disadvantaged institutions. The state will have to  come
to the party in order to bail some of them out for the time  being  so  that
they can continue with a clean slate.

The New NP cannot condone clause 24,  which  repeals  all  existing  private
Acts of universities. My colleague in the DP said this  earlier,  and  I  am
also going to use that exact wording. Unisa made an excellent input. I  know
the Minister and Unisa do not always  see  eye  to  eye,  or  at  least  the
council of Unisa and the Minister. [Interjections.] That is what I  read  in
the  newspapers,   but   perhaps   the   Minister   can   react   to   that.
[Interjections.] In any case, Unisa correctly indicated that this Bill  will
put a final end  to  a  long  tradition  in  the  South  African  university
environment, namely that Parliament, by legislation, brings life  and  death
to universities. Now this power will squarely rest with the executive.

No wonder the SA University Vice Chancellors' Association also said:


  The implicit  change  from  parliamentary  to  ministerial  oversight  of
  university charters, which the repeal brings about, is significant.

The New NP remains convinced that the right way to go is to amend the  Acts,
instead of repealing them.  The  amendment  route  would  have  brought  the
private Acts in line with the Higher Education  Act  and  the  Constitution,
whilst  simulteneously  preserving  those  measures  reflecting  the  unique
elements of the history and character of the universities.

It has been argued that  some  provisions  of  the  private  Acts  could  be
accommodated in the statutes. If this is to be the case,  a  provision  must
be inserted in the Higher Education Act requiring the Minister  to  place  a
resolution for adoption of the statute before Parliament, because  then  one
can at least debate the decision of the Minister.

Ek gaan nou in  Afrikaans  afsluit  deur  net  twee  versoeke  aan  die  agb
Minister te rig. Die agb Minister moet asseblief in  gesprek  tree  met  die
Universiteitsraad  van  die   Universiteit   van   Potchefstroom   oor   die
moontlikheid om die Christelike grondslag waarop die Universiteit berus,  in
hulle statuut op te neem. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I will now end in Afrikaans by putting two requests to  the  hon  Minister.
The hon  the  Minister  should  please  discuss  with  the  Council  of  the
University of Potchefstroom the possibility of incorporating  the  Christian
ethos of the university in its statute.]

The Minister should engage the Council of the  University  of  Potchefstroom
on the possibility of entertaining the Christian foundation in the  statutes
of the university.

Die Minister moet ook in gesprek tree met die Universiteit van  Stellenbosch
om die kwessie van Afrikaans as onderrigtaal, wat  op  die  oomblik  in  die
privaatwet is, ook in hulle statuut op te  neem  ...  [The  Minister  should
also hold discussions with the University  of  Stellenbosch  to  incorporate
the issue of Afrikaans as the language  of  instruction,  which  at  present
appears in its private Act, in its statute ... ]

... and engage with the Council of the University of  Stellenbosch  to  take
the issue of Afrikaans as a language of instruction and accommodate that  in
the statute. [Applause.]

Nkk  P  N  MNANDI:  Sihlalo,  boNgqongqoshe  abahloniphekile,   bahlonishwa,
maqabane nezihlobo. Kufanele njalo sikhumbuzane  ukuthi  alikho  izwe  elake
lakhululeka ngaphandle kokuzabalaza, ukuzikhandla nokuzinikela.

UKhongolose ukwenzile konke lokhu futhi usaqhubeka.  Kusukela  ngonyaka  ka-
1994 kuthatha uHulumeni  oholwa  nguKhongolose,  lelizwe  libone  izinguquko
ziza ngendlela emangalisayo  futhi  ziza  ngeisikhulu  isivinini.  KuMnyango
wezeMfundo  khona,  singebale  ngoba  kuyacaca  ukuthi  ikusasa  leNingizimu
Afrika  lisenhliziyweni  yawo  lo  Hulumeni.  Siyabonga  kuKhongolose  ngoba
akawavuli nje amasango emfundo, uwavula gengelezi baze bapaquze o-DA  no-NNP
bathi kuyashisa, ngenxa kaKhongolose.
UMthetho   weMfundo   ePhakeme   ka-1994   wanikeza   uNgqongqoshe    igunya
lokuhlanganisa izikhungo ezithize zemfundo ephakeme kuleli.  Namhlanje  siza
kule Ndlu  nesichibiyelo  esithi  uNgqongqoshe  akanikezwe  igunya  namandla
okumisa    izigungu    zesikhashana    zokongamela    izikhungo    ngenkathi
zisahlanganiswa.

Kungani thina njengoKhongolose sihambisana nokuhlanganiswa kwalezi  zikhungo
na?  Kuningi  ukuqhudelana  okukhona   ngezifundo   ezifanayo   ezikhungweni
zemfundo  ephakeme.  Lokhu  kudala  ukuthi  ezinye  izikhungo  zidlondlobale
kakhulu kanti ezinye zifadabale.

Akubo nabo omahambanendlwana bezikhungo la kwelakithi. Uma lokhu  kuqhubeka,
siyogcina sinemijondolo yezikhungo. Labo  mahambanendlwana  basetshenziselwa
futhi ukugcina  abafundi,  ikakhulukazi  abamnyama,  abakude  le  nezikhungo
ngqo. Manje sizama imizamo yokuyiqeda nya le mikhuba ngalo  Mthetho.  Sifuna
ukuthi izikhungo zilawuleke kahle ngendlela ukuze  izinga  lemfundo  lihlale
liphakeme njalo.
Ngizobeka  izibonelo  zalezi  zikhungo  esithi   mazihlanganiswe.   ENyuvesi
yaseNtshona  kunegatsha  laseQwaqwa,  kodwa  iQwaqwa  ikude  le  eFreystata.
Abaziyo bathi ingamakhilomitha ayi-500  ukusuka  eFreystata.  Sithi  iQwaqwa
ayihlanganiswe neNyuvesi yaseFreystata. [Ihlombe.] INyuvesi  yaseVista  yona
inezikhungo cishe  ezweni  lonke.  Sithi  kufanele  ihlakazwe,  kube  yilelo
nalelo gatsha lihlanganiswe nesikhungo esiseduze nalo.

Kunohlelo olubekiwe, ngiyamangala uma i-DA ingalwazi,  lokuthi  uNgqongqoshe
kufanele enze njani ngaphambi kokuba  ahlanganise  lezi  zikhungo.  Kuthiwa,
okokuqala, kufanele abhalele izikhungo  ezithintekayo.  Okwesibili  kufanele
enze  izimemezelo  ephephandabeni,  asho  nezizathu  zokuthi  kungani   lezi
zikhungo  zihlanganiswa.  Kufanele  anikeze  ithuba  kuzo  zonke   izikhungo
ezithintekayo ukuthi ziphawule ngalolu daba, nanoma  ngubani-ke  nje  omunye
oqhamuka emphakathini unelungelo lokuphawula.

Lo mthetho uphinde usho futhi ukuthi uNgqongqoshe  kufanele  abalalele  labo
abaphawulayo futhi azanelise ukuthi abaqashi balezo  zikhungo  bayayilandela
yini yonke imithetho yabasebenzi mayelana nabasebenzi  abathintekayo  kulezo
zikhungo.  Sazi  kahle  kamhlophe  ukuthi   ubandlululo   alukapheli   lapha
eNingizimu  Afrika  futhi  angeke  luncibilike.  Yingakho  kufanele   ukuthi
uNgqongqoshe simnikeze igunya namandla  okuhlanganisa  lezi  zikhungo  ngoba
uma singathi abazihlanganele ngokwabo, inkomo ingazala  umuntu.  UKhongolose
kuphela okwazi ukubhidliza izindonga zobandlululo lapha eNingizimu Afrika.

Okwesibili,    yingani    sithi     izikhungo     ezithintekayo     azingabi
ngongqoshishilizi kulolu hlelo? Useshilo-ke ushlalo.  Uthe  uma  ngabe  kube
njalo, kusho ukuthi sithi abadlali ababe  ngonompempe.  Akukaze-ke  kwenzeke
lokho. Okunye-ke asingamangali bakwethu uma  sibona  o-DP  no-New  NP  benza
nje.  Phela  babeyingxenye   kahulumeni   wobandlululo.   Basincisha   wonke
amathuba. Namhlanje bayapaquza uma sishaya imithetho  enobuchule,  enobuciko
nenobunyonico obungaka. Bahluleka, mabakhohlwe.  Ngeke  baphinde  baliphathe
leli zwe. (Translation of Zulu speech follows.)

[Ms P N MNANDI:  Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,  hon  members,  comrades  and
relatives, we should always remind one another that no country has  attained
freedom without first struggling, working  hard  and  dedicating  itself  to
this.

The ANC has done all these things and is still doing so.  Since  1994,  when
the ANC came into power, this country has witnessed the  changes  that  have
happened in a fast and surprising way. With  regard  to  the  Department  of
Education, we cannot even mention the things that the Government  has  done.
It is clear that education is dear to  the  heart  of  this  Government.  We
thank the ANC, because it not only opens the gates of education, it does  so
in such a way that the DP and the New NP are shaking, saying that it is  hot
here, and that is caused by the ANC.

The Tertiary Education Act of 1994 gave the  ANC  the  right  to  unite  the
institutions of tertiary education in this country. Today we  come  to  this
House with the amendment which states that the Minister should be given  the
right and the power to  appoint  interim  councils  that  will  oversee  the
institutions while they are being merged.

Why do we as the ANC support the merging of  these  institutions?  There  is
too much competition on the same subjects  in  the  institutions  of  higher
education. This causes some  institutions  to  flourish,  while  others  are
failing.

There are plenty of mobile institutions in our country.  If  this  situation
persists we will end  up  having  plenty  of  informal  institutions.  These
mobile institutions are used to delay students,  especially  black  students
who are far from real institutions. Through this legislation we  are  trying
to put an end to this custom. We want tertiary institutions to  be  governed
in a good way, so that the level of education will stay high.

Now I will give examples of these institutions that I say should be  merged.
The University of the North has a branch in Qwaqwa, although  Qwaqwa  is  in
the Free State. Those who know the place say it is about  500  km  from  the
Free State. We are saying the  Qwaqwa  branch  should  be  merged  with  the
University of the Free State. [Applause.] The Vista University has  branches
almost everywhere in the country. We say they should be closed  down.  These
branches should be merged with the institutions close to them.

There is a programme that is reserved. I wonder if  the  DP  does  not  know
this. The programme is about what the Minister should do  before  he  merges
these institutions. It states, firstly, that he should write letters to  the
institutions concerned.  Secondly,  he  should  make  announcements  in  the
newspapers and give the reasons why these institutions are being merged.  He
should give the institutions concerned the opportunity to  comment  on  this
issue. Every member of the public has the right to comment.

This legislation also provides that the Minister should listen to those  who
are making comments and  he  should  ensure  that  the  employers  in  those
institutions follow  the  labour  laws  concerning  the  employees  who  are
affected at those institutions. We  know  very  well  that  apartheid  still
exists in South Africa and it will  not  just  disappear.  That  is  why  we
should give the Minister the right to merge these institutions.  The  reason
for this is, if we can say they should do it themselves,  a  cow  will  give
birth to a human being. It is only the ANC that can demolish  the  walls  of
apartheid here in South Africa.

Thirdly, why are we saying the institutions concerned should not  lead  this
programme. The Chairperson has already answered this question. He said  that
if this were so, it would mean that the players would have no referee.  Such
a thing has never happened. Another thing is that we are  not  surprised  to
see the DP doing what they are  doing.  In  fact,  they  were  part  of  the
apartheid regime. They deprived us of all the opportunities. Today they  are
shaking when we pass intelligent, artistic and  creative  legislation.  They
failed, they must now forget  about  it.  They  will  never  ever  run  this
country.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, Minister of Education, all  the  Ministers  and
colleagues here, the Higher Education Amendment Bill of 2001 seeks to  amend
the Higher Education  Act  of  1997,  so  as  to  provide  that  the  Higher
Education Quality Committee is deemed to be accredited as an  Education  and
Training Quality  Assurance  Body;  to  provide  for  the  establishment  of
interim councils  for  new,  declared  or  merged  public  higher  education
institutions; and to provide for the dissolution of the council of a  public
higher education institution if 75% or more of the members resign,  and  for
the constitution of a new council.

We see the Higher Education Amendment  Bill  as  an  instrument  setting  in
motion the process of realising the vision or goals set out in the  National
Plan for Higher Education for the transformation  of  the  higher  education
system in this country. Thus section 7 of the principal Act  is  amended  by
the insertion after subsection(1) of the following subsection:


  The Higher Education Quality Committee is deemed to be accredited by SAQA
  as an Education and Training Quality Assurance body primarily responsible
  for higher education.

The Higher Education Quality Committee drives the process  of  reconfiguring
the higher education system, which must play a  central  role  in  national,
regional and local development.

In point 1.7 of the National Plan for Higher Education, the Ministry  allays
the fears of many institutions of higher education that  they  face  closure
under  the  Higher  Education  Amendment  Bill.  The  goals  and   strategic
objectives, inter alia, are to provide increased access to higher  education
to all, irrespective of race, gender, age, creed, class or  disability,  and
to produce graduates with the skills and competencies necessary to meet  the
human resource needs of the country; and, secondly,  to  promote  equity  of
access and to redress past inequalities  by  ensuring  that  the  staff  and
student profiles in higher education progressively reflect  the  demographic
realities of South African society.

In order to achieve a  complete  reconfiguration  of  the  higher  education
system, the Bill provides the Minister with a tool  or  instrument,  namely,
the interim council. The Minister must establish an interim  council  for  a
period not exceeding six months to perform the  functions  relating  to  the
governance of  the  institution,  except  the  making  of  an  institutional
statute. This body facilitates the  process  of  merging  institutions  that
desire to do so. If the process of  merging  has  not  been  completed,  the
Minister may extend the period of the interim council  once  for  a  further
period not exceeding six months.

The interim council which  paves  the  way  for  the  establishment  of  the
council is appointed by the Minister and consists of five members, that  is,
the chairperson and four  others.  It  must  co-opt  three  members  of  the
interim management and these members have no voting  powers.  Even  if  they
had them, they would be outvoted in any case. [Time expired.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, the two minutes  provided  do  not  allow  me  to
completely express myself on the matter. But, let me start  by  saying  that
the ACDP concurs with the view held by several independent thinkers such  as
Unisa on the issue of the autonomy of higher education institutions. Let  me
quote what they say:


  Government has two functions  in  respect  of  the  provision  of  higher
  education. Firstly, it should establish a system  for  the  provision  of
  public  education  by  creating  institutions   and   demonstrating   the
  objectives. Secondly, it should make resources available in  a  fair  and
  transparent  manner  to  the  public  higher   education   system.   This
  necessitates the introduction of control measures ensuring accountability
  but it is not the function of Government to administer the system in  all
  its ramifications from a control point.

A balanced  approach  to  what  a  university  is  cannot  be  attained  and
maintained when there is unnecessary interference in  the  internal  affairs
of  the  institution.  Overregulation  of  the  university   by   Government
endangers its functions as a seeker of the truth, and  as  a  conscience  to
the Government  and  society  in  general.  It  endangers  the  university's
functions to serve as a centre of excellence where basic  questions  can  be
asked and  where  the  value  issues  of  society  can  be  drawn  into  the
disciplined context of rational enquiry and dialogue.

The ACDP is concerned that the overregulation that  is  prescribed  by  this
Bill could  become  a  grave  threat  to  the  academic  freedom  of  higher
education institutions. The issue  is  not  unity  or  the  merging  of  the
institutions.  We  agree  that  we  must  do  away  with  apartheid  in  the
institutions, but our concern is the loss of autonomy in that process.

We believe that the  Christian  culture  and  foundations  of  Potchefstroom
University should be  maintained  if  the  university  authorities  and  the
student  population  support  the  present  culture.   University   culture,
preferred  language  and  positive  traditions  should  be   determined   by
autonomous universities and should not be left to  the  sole  discretion  of
the Minister.
The virtually unfettered discretion of the Minister to decide  the  fate  of
public higher education institutions is a grave  concern  to  us.  It  does,
however, appear that autonomy is a very loosely defined  concept  in  regard
to lines of authority, and, of course, universities and the Government  have
different views on this.

A case  in  point  is  the  Minister's  interference  in  the  selection  of
Potchefstroom University's new chancellor. The university wanted to  appoint
a person who subscribes to their values, but  the  Minister's  approach  was
such that Potchefstroom University had to implement directives from  him  as
the education boss.

Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairperson, the universities of  Oxford  and  Cambridge
in the United Kingdom are located quite a distance from London,  the  symbol
of government power and government control. It may be a coincidence, but  in
a certain way, it is also a statement of the autonomy and  the  independence
of some of the oldest universities in the world from government control.
In the last 40 years in South Africa, I can remember more than once the  big
clashes and conflicts between the old NP government and the universities  of
the Witwatersrand, Natal or any of those. The government of  the  day  tried
to put pressure  on  those  universities,  but  they  successfully  defended
themselves and their autonomy.

As far as I know, a woman is either pregnant or not. There  are  no  degrees
of pregnancy. The same applies to autonomy.  One  is  either  autonomous  or
not, there are no degrees of autonomy, as I understand it.

It is our job as Parliament to make it as  difficult  as  possible  for  the
Minister, whether he is good or bad, or any future PAC or  AZAPO  government
Ministers, to be in a position where he may  be  tempted  to  undermine  the
autonomy of universities. Therefore, this situation must  be  able  to  hold
for a long time. As far as we are concerned, this amending Bill, as well  as
the original Act of 1979, give too much power to the Minister.
Die VF het om dieselfde redes teen die oorspronklike Wet  op  Hoër  Onderwys
in  1997  gestem.  Dit  is  moeilik  om  te  argumenteer  dat  'n  mens  die
wysigingswet steun as jy reeds probleme  met  die  oorspronklike  wet  gehad
het.

Prof Gerwel is  besig  om  sekere  voorstelle  te  doen  oor  universiteite.
Verskeie van die VF se voorstelle is deur prof Gerwel  aanvaar,  en  ons  is
dankbaar daaroor. Met ander van sy voorstelle verskil die VF. Die  vraag  is
of  hierdie  wet  nie  moet  wag  tot  ons  ook  duidelikheid  het  oor  die
implikasies van prof Gerwel se aanbevelings, en hoe dit geïmplimenteer  moet
word nie. Miskien is dit dan makliker in  daardie  stadium  om  die  wet  te
steun al dan nie.

Die VF gaan teen die wysiging stem.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[The FF voted against the original Higher Education  Act  in  1997  for  the
same reasons. It is difficult to state that one supports the  amending  Bill
if one has already had problems with the original Act.
Prof Gerwel is making certain proposals about universities. A number of  the
FF's proposals have been accepted by Prof Gerwel, and we  are  grateful  for
that. The FF does not  agree  with  several  other  of  his  proposals.  The
question is whether this legislation should not  wait  until  we  also  have
clarity about the implications of Prof  Gerwel's  recommendations,  and  how
they should be implemented. Perhaps at that stage it would  then  be  easier
to support the legislation or oppose it.

The FF is going to vote against the amendment.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Mr Chairperson and hon members, in 1990,  11  years  before
his death and four years before South Africa had  a  democratic  government,
the late Dr Govan  Mbeki  sounded  prophetic  while  delivering  the  annual
Richard Feetham Memorial Lecture on Academic Freedom at  the  University  of
the Witwatersrand. He said, and I quote:


  It may therefore be that we need  to  reopen  the  discussion  about  the
  concepts of academic freedom and autonomy of the university, so  that  no
  question should arise to suggest  that  we  are  pleading  the  cause  of
  popular  and  democratic  transformation  as  a  means  of  limiting  the
  legitimate democratic rights of the university.

How right the sage was! During  deliberations  on  the  Bill,  some  of  our
colleagues took issue with clause 4 of the Bill, which  states  that:  ``The
Minister must establish an interim council for a period  not  exceeding  six
months.''

They preferred the wording: ``The Minister may'', but we feel that to  drive
transformation through, the word  ``must''  is  used  to  leave  nothing  to
chance. An interim council has to be established  when  institutions  merge.
Neither institutions' council has to lead their merger.

The UCDP also fully subscribes to the notion  that  institutions  of  higher
learning should be registered provisionally, rather than conditionally.  The
former means that such registration is  for  the  time  being,  whereas  the
latter may mean permanent registration on condition that some criteria  have
been met.

If and when the rationalisation  of  public  higher  education  institutions
takes place, as approved by this House in April, there will be no  need  for
private Acts of each of the merged institutions to remain in  place.  It  is
logical that as a new institution with a new corporate  image,  new  council
and new management, there will be no need to bring along  any  private  Acts
from any of the merging institutions. All such Acts have to be repealed  and
new ones, for the merged institutions, be put in place.

In 1994, when  former  President  Nelson  Mandela  delivered  his  inaugural
address to this House, he said, to enthusiastic applause: ``Our people  said
they want change, and it is change that we are going to give them.''

This Bill seeks to do that, and therefore the UCDP supports it.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, universities, since their inception in the  10th
and 11th centuries, have always reflected the type of society in which  they
were established. They also played an important part in challenging  society
and its beliefs, and helped to  mould  society.  In  the  complex,  racially
divided society that characterised South  Africa  for  a  century  or  more,
universities were a  mirror  image  of  South  African  society.  They  also
conformed to the norms of our nation, in some cases becoming glorified  high
schools.

A university that does not grapple with ideas and  is  not  gripped  by  the
quest for  the  truth  is  not  a  university  at  all.  Our  South  African
universities developed, with time, into racial and ethnic ghettos. Even  our
showpiece, Wits University, as shown in the transformation saga, called  the
Prof  Willie  Makgoba  case,  was  a  ghetto  with  a  veneer  of   academic
respectability.

It is against this background that we support this Bill, which we hope  will
achieve rationalisation and co-ordination  of  our  institutions  of  higher
learning.  Our  tertiary  institutions  must  guard  against  losing   their
uniqueness, character and academic independence.

The universities must strive to become  centres  of  excellence  and  attain
standards that will  be  the  envy  of  others.  Much  will  depend  on  the
vigilance  of  the  SA  Certification  Council  and  the  Quality  Assurance
Council. The Minister of Education and  provincial  MECs  of  education  are
given extensive powers, which, we hope, will  not  in  time  fall  into  the
hands of officials who may politicise the system and  allow  it  to  develop
seeds of disintegration.

Some Western countries have allowed universities and technikons to  mushroom
everywhere, with the result that some dubious institutions  emerged,  giving
some people easy and lofty degrees which were not worth the paper  on  which
they were written. The elimination of this danger is the strongest  argument
in support of this Bill.

This Bill has another function, which, I believe, is important:  It  is  the
assessment of the examination system, including marking of  the  examination
scripts. The Bill also ensures that there  is  accreditation  of  providers.
[Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, Minister, the MF  asserts  that  education  is
not a privilege but a right. This right is firmly inculcated by  section  29
of  the  national  Constitution.  The  MF  also  confidently  supports   the
correction of past imbalances in  education  and  supports  the  efforts  to
correct this. As equal people, we have the right  to  equal  education.  Not
only will this provide harmony, but also an  educated  nation,  which  is  a
better and stronger nation.

The MF acknowledges that previous higher education  institutions  have  been
utilising private Acts that were passed during the apartheid  era,  creating
institutions on the basis of colour. The MF notes  the  urgency  to  correct
this inequality and  unacceptable  practice.  The  MF  hereby  applauds  the
department for having repealed these private Acts.

The MF has no reservation on the transfer of duties from  the  Certification
Council for Technikon Education to the Higher  Education  Quality  Committee
of the Council on Higher Education. The MF views the  establishment  of  the
interim council for  new,  declared  or  merged  public  institutions  as  a
mechanism for guiding what the previous Bill had not provided for.  However,
the  MF  does  note  the  inability  of  the  interim  council  to  make  an
institutional statute and is, therefore, concerned as to whether there  will
be guidelines for the council to use in the interim.

The  MF  notes  the  clarity  that  the  amending  Bill  provides  regarding
registration. This clarification  is  surely  catered  for  in  the  concise
categorisation of a situation,  and  support  for  the  amending  Bill  will
ensure that the higher  education  institutions  operate  within  prescribed
policies. The MF supports the Higher Education Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Voorsitter, hierdie wysiging aan die Wet op Hoër  Onderwys  is
op sig self, niks nuuts nie. Dit is in wese bloot die  naskok  van  'n  slag
wat reeds gelewer is in 1995 toe die aanvanklike  wet  aanvaar  is.  Daardie
wet oorspan reeds die huidige privaatwette van universiteite. Die skrap  van
hierdie wette maak dus nie wesenlike verskil aan die huidige  situasie  nie,
maar reël dit juridies.

Die vraag is nou of ons met hierdie saak kan saamgaan. Die AEB  se  probleem
lê nie by hierdie wetswysiging as sodanig nie, maar in die  geheel;  nie  by
enkele klousules wat vandag  deurkom  nie,  maar  by  die  koers  wat  reeds
ingeslaan is met die aanvaarding van  die  oorspronklike  wet.  Die  AEB  se
teenstem teen hierdie wet is dus nie teen bepaalde klousules, maar teen  die
status quo wat nou gereël word en bevestig word.

Die agb lid van  die  IVP  het  gevra  of  skrapping  van  die  privaatwette
outonomie in die gedrang bring. Kom ons kyk na die situasie. In die  praktyk
word tersiêre inrigtings se outonomie prakties gereël deur  sy  statute.  In
die  verlede  is  dit  op  sy  beurt  begrens  deur  die  universiteite   se
privaatwette. Hierdie wet kon slegs  gewysig  word  deur  die  Parlement  en
universitêre outonomie was dus parlementêr gereël. Nou is  dit  een  wet  en
die statute is afhanklik van die uitvoerende gesag.

Uiteraard is die pad van ingrype in eie sake van  'n  inrigting  nou  soveel
makliker  en  in  een  persoon  gesentreerd.  Dit  is  'n  verskuiwing   van
parlementêre  na  ministeriële  oorsig  oor  universiteite.  Die  foute  wat
bestaan in privaatwette kon gewysig word. Ons moenie die kind saam  met  die
badwater uitgooi  nie.  Die  privaatwette  was  inderdaad  simbool  van  die
pragtige beginsel van selfstandigheid van universiteite as  instellings  van
die burgerlike samelewing.

Hierby wil ek net by wat die agb Geldenhuys gesê het voeg, dat  die  statute
ten opsigte van die PU vir CHO reeds in ooreenstemming gebring is met  sowel
die Grondwet as hul Christelike karakter. Ons beroep is op die  Minister  om
dit te eerbiedig en ons wil glo dat die handhawing van die  PU  vir  CHO  se
Christelike karakter, die toetssaak vir die huidige Minister se mooi  woorde
oor outonomie aan die universiteit sal wees. Ons teenkanting  teen  die  wet
is dus teen die oorspronklike en  nie  teen  die  wysigings  as  sulks  nie.

[Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, this amendment to the Higher  Education  Act  is,
in itself, nothing new. It is in fact merely the aftershock of a blow  which
was already struck in 1995 when the  original  Act  was  adopted.  That  Act
already spans the current private Act on universities. The repeal  of  these
Acts therefore does  not  make  a  significant  difference  to  the  current
situation, but regulates it judicially.

Question now is whether we can go along with this matter. The AEB's  problem
does not lie in this statutory amendment as such,  but  in  the  whole;  not
with single clauses which are coming through today, but with  the  direction
already taken with the adoption of the original Act. The AEB's vote  against
this Act is therefore  not  against  particular  clauses,  but  against  the
status quo which is now being regulated and confirmed.

The hon member from the IFP asked whether repealing the private  Acts  would
jeopardise autonomy. Let us look at the situation. In practice the  autonomy
of tertiary institutions is practically regulated by their statutes. In  the
past this in turn was confined by the universities' private Acts.  This  Act
could only be  amended  by  Parliament  and  university  autonomy  was  thus
parliamentarily controlled. There is  now  one  Act  and  the  statutes  are
independent of the executive authority.

Naturally, the path of intervention in an institution's own matters  is  now
so much easier  and  centralised  in  one  person.  This  is  a  shift  from
parliamentary to ministerial oversight of  universities.  The  faults  which
exist in private Acts could have been amended. We must  not  throw  out  the
baby with the bath water. Indeed, the private  Acts  were  symbolic  of  the
sound principle of the autonomy of universities  as  institutions  of  civil
society.
I would also just like to add to what the  hon  Geldenhuys  said,  that  the
statutes with regard to the PU for CHE have already  been  brought  in  line
with both the Constitution and their Christian character. Our appeal to  the
Minister is to honour this and we believe that the  maintenance  of  the  PU
for CHE's Christian  character  will  be  the  test  case  for  the  current
Minister's fine words about autonomy for the university. Our  opposition  to
the Act is therefore to the original and not to the amendment as such.]

Prof  S  S  RIPINGA:  Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,  comrades,  ladies   and
gentlemen, transforming the South African higher education system in such  a
way that the legacies of inequality are eliminated  and  it  makes  a  major
contribution to national reconstruction and development requires  a  massive
national effort. In supporting the Higher Education Amendment  Bill,  we  in
the ANC wish to thank  the  Minister  for  steering  the  transformation  of
higher education to this point, and we do so on behalf  of  our  people  out
there.

Our Constitution and other  pieces  of  legislation  provide  the  requisite
powers to the Minister to execute this mammoth task. In fact, we in the  ANC
are  surprised  that  the  issue  of  power  is  being  debated  here.   Our
Constitution makes provision for this and  other  legislation  provides  for
this. The issue of `must' or `may' as contested by some members on  my  left
is a nonissue.

It might be an issue of semantics in another context. We, of  course,  would
be quite happy to teach members of the opposition  a  lesson  or  two  about
semantics. Their first lesson was from their leader, Tony Leon, who is  well
known for not knowing front from back. Starting from the back, he  only  got
as far as antics.

The fundamental point of policy on which  all  stakeholders  in  the  higher
education system are agreed - and  with  which  some  members  on  the  left
disagree - is that higher education must be planned, governed and funded  as
a single national co-ordinated system. This, obviously,  will  overcome  the
fragmentation, inequality and inefficiency we inherited from the members  on
the left, as part  of  their  legacy.  It  will  also  successfully  address
present and future challenges of reconstruction.

We will forsake our role as educators if we do  not  remind  the  opposition
parties that transformation is a process and not an end in  itself.  So,  we
shall support the proposed amendment to the principal Act in order to  fine-
tune, streamline or consolidate the higher education system  into  a  single
co-ordinated system.

For instance, the repeal of private university Acts and the provision  of  a
seat for a public higher education institution,  as  proposed  in  the  Bill
before us, are fundamental to the transformation  of  the  Higher  Education
Act. The private university Acts of the apartheid era represent a legacy  of
colonial  and  commonwealth  traditions  in   university   governance.   The
continued existence of these Acts has perpetuated  fragmentation  of  public
higher education institutions and  has  constrained  the  achievement  of  a
single co-ordinated system of higher education.
The SA University Vice Chancellors' Association, the Committee of  Technikon
Principals,  the   Association   of   Vice   Chancellors   of   Historically
Disadvantaged Institutions of South Africa and other  stakeholders,  support
the Bill. I am surprised that the members of the opposition do  not  support
the Bill, whilst the institutions themselves support the repeal  of  private
Acts.

Reservations that might have existed on the basis of  the  impact  that  the
repeal of the old Acts would have on autonomy have been aptly  clarified  by
the Minister  and  my  colleagues,  and  I  would  also  like  to  thank  my
colleague, hon Mpontshane, for his input on the issue of autonomy.  However,
I wish to add that the fundamental principle of  institutional  autonomy  is
not an end, but a means to an end. This principle should  be  understood  in
relation to other  principles  that  guide  the  transformation  process  of
higher education, and not  in  isolation  therefrom.  The  glorification  of
institutional autonomy is, therefore, unjustified.

The diversity of higher education providers and the greater competition  for
fewer available students  have  changed  the  physical  operation  bases  of
higher education institutions. The proliferation of satellite campuses,  the
use  of  satellite  technologies,  e-degree  and  telematic  education  have
created a new  challenge  in  the  planning  of  higher  education  and  the
establishment of a single, co-ordinated system of higher education.

There is a need,  therefore,  to  bring  legal  certainty  to  the  physical
operational boundaries of higher education institutions.  So  the  amendment
will  ensure  that  all  higher  education   institutions   operate   within
prescribed policy.

Allow me to respond to some of the issues that have been raised  in  respect
of the amendment. The issue of institutional autonomy  has  been  raised  by
the hon Ntuli, and the issue of power has also been  raised.  These  matters
have been clearly clarified. We have been clarifying the issue  of  autonomy
from 1994 to date.

Secondly,  to  respond  to  hon  Mr  Mpontshane,  regarding  the  issue   of
casualties,  it  is  quite  obvious,  in  fact,  that  in  the  process   of
consultation or transformation there might be casualties, as  he  indicated.
However, the consultation  that  is  provided  for  by  the  democratisation
process will allow for these casualties to be addressed in  a  positive  and
constructive manner.

The hon Geldenhuys made reference to experts that made inputs during  public
hearings. The experts normally provide the relevant knowledge, but it is  up
to the party to refine and process that input in  such  a  way  that  it  is
relevant to the issue concerned. So it is not a question of using the  input
of the so-called experts in its entirety.

Concerning the issue of basic logic, I  think  the  Minister  was  referring
here to elementary logic. He was  referring  to  common  sense,  and  common
sense is not always common. So that is the reason I am  not  surprised  that
the hon Geldenhuys could not  understand,  because  basic  logic  is  common
sense, which is not always common.

Furthermore, I think  reference  to  the  dictionary  meaning  of  the  word
``autonomy'' is a problem - I direct this to Dr  Geldenhuys  -  because  the
dictionary meaning  of  a  word  changes  according  to  context.  It  means
something in one  context,  and  something  else  in  another.  So  using  a
definition from the dictionary is out of order. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Prof S S RIPINGA: As far as lack of consultation is concerned,  as  outlined
by my colleague hon Mnandi, sections 22 and 23 of the  principal  Act  spell
it out in  respect  of  mergers,  declared  institutions  and  any  type  of
transformation that is going to take place.

I also note the appeal by the University of Potchefstroom that those  values
- religious and Christian values - and the question of language,  should  be
smuggled into the institutional statute. I think  the  ANC  will  make  sure
that any issue,  expression  and  values  that  are  offensive  and  are  in
conflict with the Constitutional obligations are not taken on board  in  the
institutional statute.

The issue  of  overregulation  of  universities  is  a  danger  to  academic
freedom. I think I find it difficult to engage the hon Mr Green  because  he
did not attend meetings  and  these  matters  had  been  dealt  with  there.
Otherwise, I would like to thank the other hon members that  have  supported
the Bill.

The system of higher education must be reshaped, firstly, to  save  the  new
social order; secondly, to meet national and regional needs;  and,  thirdly,
to respond to new realities and opportunities. The creation of  this  system
is overdue. The ANC supports the  amendment  to  ensure  that  planning  and
governance of  reconfigured  higher  education  institutions  are  realised.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson and hon members, I sat  next  to  the
previous Minister of Education for five years, particularly when the  Higher
Education Bill was before Parliament. There is a  sense  here  that  nothing
has changed  in  our  country  because  I  heard  the  same  sentiments  and
statements made then as I heard this afternoon. But the hon  Mike  Ellis  is
not here. He said I must not be petty and partisan while I was  speaking.  I
shall try not to be petty and partisan, but he is not here.  He  should  not
have shouted, when the hon Mpontshane was speaking, that he was only  saying
what he said because he wanted to join the ANC. This is not in keeping  with
the kind of dignity that Mr Ellis wants.

I have gone through this Bill as Minister and after five years, I  have  not
seen any illustration from my department or anybody else that the  Bill  has
been  used  to  violate  those  sacred  principles  of   autonomy   or   the
constitutionally protected principle of academic freedom. On the contrary  -
and Mr Heine can bear this out - the DP asked me to intervene  at  Technikon
Mangosuthu three or four times.

Time and again I have been asked to intervene by students because they  felt
that their chancellors or vice  chancellors  were  not  carrying  out  their
duties. I have refrained from intervening because a  council  must  in  fact
make up its mind. Similarly, when the  Public  Protector  has  asked  me  to
investigate corruption in universities and technikons, I have said that  the
council of the institution must carry out the investigation. I have in  fact
respected the authority of these institutions. Therefore, I want  to  inform
Dr Mulder that autonomy cannot be used as an elastic principle. It is  self-
evident.

A week ago my office was asked by parents why no teaching was  taking  place
in the law faculty of a university. Senior officials enquired,  but  because
of parliamentary Rules, I cannot say what they actually said; they  said  we
should mind our own business. They said this to my officials. On  the  basis
of that, what happens inside a university, eg when  no  teaching  is  taking
place, is the university's business. This is licence of the worst  kind.  No
one can say that a  national  department  which  has  a  responsibility  and
spends R7 billion towards education, has no right to enquire  on  behalf  of
parents why a university or any other institution similar to  it,  is  being
officiously incompetent.

Therefore, we have to be very careful how we continue to fight  the  battles
of 1996-97 today. What we are trying to do now - and the hon Ntuli  was  the
only one who mentioned this word - is to transform. We are trying to  change
the spatial geography of apartheid, which was wasteful and did not meet  the
needs of our society. We  are  also  trying  to  change  the  way  in  which
irrelevant subjects are being taught in a repetitive  and  competitive  way.
We drew attention to this fact in the National Plan for Higher Education.

I would have thought, without being  paternalistic,  that  members  of  this
House would have turned, as Comrade Mnandi did, to  the  National  Plan  for
Higher Education. A centrepiece, as Comrade Mnandi has pointed out,  is  the
need to turn to  what  we  inherited  and  change  it  consistent  with  the
assumptions on which we operate. It is therefore a  pity  that  we  continue
fighting some battles that are long lost.

The hon Ntuli stated his objections to the Minister setting  the  priorities
of higher education. I know of no government in  the  world  that  does  not
steer higher education systems in support of broad policy goals. But  it  is
not a question of interference: it is part of meeting national needs.  After
all, universities and technikons are not the  guild  system  where  one  has
self-regulation. No one recognises the  guild  system  in  higher  education
today, where one has  self-regulation.  After  all,  many  governments  make
large investments in higher education.

In the current financial year this House has  voted  R7  billion  to  higher
education. This is equivalent to the top 25 countries in the world,  ie  the
OECD countries. Surely we have a right to  ensure  accountability  of  these
very important public resources. Indeed, it  is  our  obligation  to  ensure
that universities and technikons respond to our  goals  of  equity,  quality
teaching, learning and research. Very little research  is  being  done,  and
therefore, we will use money to help institutions do research.

I am beginning to wonder why so many members of the opposition  continue  to
muddy the difference between academic freedom  and  institutional  autonomy,
because we must be quite clear regarding those concepts.  Is  it  not  about
time that this red herring was put to rest? Then we might be  able  to  move
on.

I mentioned that academic freedom  is  enshrined  in  the  Constitution.  In
France one cannot use academic freedom  to  deny  the  holocaust.  It  is  a
criminal offence. No academic can write books  denying  the  holocaust,  and
France is a democratic country. We do not have those restrictions.

In the same way we must remember that academic freedom does  not  mean  that
universities can carry out sectarian policies. The hon Green,  who  was  not
in the portfolio committee when I was  there,  should  at  least  have  some
respect for the facts. I did not interfere in the appointment of  anyone  at
the  University  of  Potchefstroom.  What  I  did  say,  when  I   saw   the
advertisement about to be sent out, was that the  filling  of  the  position
must be based on certain fundamental principles. I  drew  attention  to  the
Constitution and to the equality legislation of our country,  which  forbids
anything to the contrary.

If Mr Green thinks that this is prescriptive, I think he should go and  talk
to people who have interfered  in  universities.  Autonomy  and  freedom  of
speech were violated under  NP  rule.  But  of  course  autonomy  cannot  be
unbridled. In fact, I would  not  be  spending  hours  and  hours  mediating
change and resolving conflict in the higher education system if I wanted  to
interfere, as the opposition tends to imply.

It is a pity that Dr Geldenhuys chose to misrepresent the principal  Act.  I
want to remind members that the Higher Education Act sets out very  clearly,
in detail, the steps that the Minister of Education  has  to  follow  before
finalising a merger. I cannot look into my bosom,  however  intelligently  I
may do that, and unfold the great panorama of  change  in  South  Africa.  I
have to do it in the prescribed way. Of course, that prescribed way is  very
public. It  is,  in  fact,  a  process  which  includes  a  vast  amount  of
consultation. I have been an academic for 30  years.  It  is  impossible  to
have mergers or  changes  without  sharp,  decisive  action  by  ministerial
authority in the democratic countries I know of.

Contrary to what hon Boy Geldenhuys says, there  has  hardly  been  any  co-
operative activity, any exchange of students or staff, or any attempt to co-
operate on a regional basis. If the national working group - a tough lot  of
academics, I must say - are rude and tough, it is because they are not  time
servers. They wanted reactions from people, but they did not get any. I  set
up this committee to assist me.

If the ANC and its Government  wanted  to  act  with  speed,  I  would  have
announced in January this year, the  mergers,  proposals  and  abolition  of
institutions. In fact, some of the  commentators  said  that  I  lacked  the
courage to do so. All I did was to announce the plan and set up  a  national
working group of very distinguished people who had no  axe  to  grind.  They
are now  going  around  the  country.  They  will  make  recommendations  by
Christmas on the basis of which I will act. This is  the  tradition  of  the
ANC. We did not want to act immediately and do things as they have  done  in
other countries.

I also remind Dr Geldenhuys that the White Paper  on  Higher  Education  and
the National Plan for Higher Education also provide  for  policy  parameters
within which I have to act. So, I do not have a total discretion to do so.

It seems Dr Mulder is losing his republican tradition.  He  now  quotes  the
United Kingdom, nogal, as a good example. I think it is a  remarkable  thing
for Dr Mulder to quote the United Kingdom as an example.  I  wonder  whether
he knows that the United Kingdom's  higher  education  system  is  far  more
regulated than the South African system. Not only  Mrs  Thatcher  did  that,
but the labour government as well.

I have fewer functional authorities in higher education than  the  secretary
of state for education in the United Kingdom. They have a very strict  range
of prescriptions with respect to financial matters, financial  controls  and
quality controls. The funding system is very different too. So I am  pleased
that Dr Mulder referred to the United Kingdom, although I am bemused that  a
republican refers approvingly to the United Kingdom. However, I just  wanted
to point out that the UK in fact, has less discretion than we  do  in  South
Africa.

In the same  way  I  would  like  to  say  that  we  cannot  get  change  or
transformation in South Africa unless we are able  to  reach  out  and  say:
What does a particular region want? What does a  particular  locality  want?
What is in the national interest? And  for  that  there  has  to  be  action
taken. That is why the interim councils will set up  an  executive  body  to
look after the teaching and all the arrangements. This is for  a  six  month
period.
I join everyone in saying that we need a  democracy  countervailing  centres
of  power.  Universities  are  another,  like  trade   unions   or   welfare
organisations.  So   technikons   and   universities   are   part   of   the
countervailing basis of power in a democracy which we need very strongly.

However, we must remember that we inherited a  rather  awful  situation:  We
inherited a situation where only 14% of our  African  brothers  and  sisters
are in higher education. Only 14% of coloureds are in higher  education.  We
cannot countenance that any more. Forty-two per cent of Indians and  42%  of
white South Africans are in higher education. We have to get more  coloureds
and more Africans into the system. We can only do  so  if  we  are  able  to
persuade these institutions to be open and more accessible.

Privilege,  whether  it  just  stops  at  religious  privilege  or  economic
privilege, can no longer be countenanced in South Africa. We  will  look  at
Potchefstroom and Stellenbosch in the context of the  reports  we  get  from
Prof Gerwel and from the national working groups. I will come back  to  this
House and we will have a proper debate before they are implemented.

I thank the members very much for their participation. It was an  enormously
important thing for us to  move  ahead,  so  that  we  can  build  a  higher
education system suitable for South Africa in the 21st century. [Applause.]

[The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY:  Chairperson,
today I want to encourage the nation that when we talk about  our  heritage,
we should remember the legends of our countrymen who left them for us. I  am
referring to people like the late Mr Mbeki, Messrs  Gumede,  Shope,  Mpetha,
Braam Fisher, O R Tambo,  Dadoo  and  our  former  presidents  Makgetha  and
Luthuli.

I remember the way Messrs Archie Gumede and Govan Mbeki  used  to  encourage
me, seeing that I was keen to see developments in our  country.  I  remember
Mr Archie Gumede coming to Mr  Luthuli's  memorial  service  attached  to  a
drip. Three weeks before Mr Mbeki, who was known as ``Oom Gov'', passed  on,
he was talking about Mr Pemba and honouring him. When  talking  about  these
men, I realise that there are also women like them,  for  example  Mrs  Kate
Molale. I would like hon members to bear with me as I did not come  here  to
present a list of  our  heroes.  I  was  just  giving  examples.  We  should
remember that these people left us a heritage.

Those who are still alive, like Mr Sisulu, continue to encourage us.  People
who stay in Gauteng know that when there are important matters,  Mr  Sisulu,
no matter how busy he might be, is there to encourage us  as  young  people.
We also have people like Ray Alexander, and our mothers, Mrs Sisulu and  Mrs
Tambo. We are very fortunate as South Africans.

Today I also remember Feroza Adams, whom we often forget.  She  was  one  of
the people who made sure that we had a reasonable Constitution.  I  remember
them today because their names are related to our heritage.]

This year, Government begins the process of engaging the  public  about  our
national symbols. This is as it should be, because national symbols  are  at
the core of how we perceive ourselves as a nation. This is about  our  sense
of identity. Our national symbols should be considered  in  the  context  of
our Constitution. And, indeed, it is in this context that  I,  then,  recall
some of our great leaders who in fact informed what was to be the  substance
of our Constitution.

Our  national  symbols  should  be  considered  in  the   context   of   our
Constitution. South Africa is, indeed, a  constitutional  state.  We,  as  a
nation, commit ourselves  to  the  values  enshrined  in  our  Constitution.
Equality, freedom, the right to social and economic development,  the  right
to dignity, protection of cultural and linguistic rights  are  some  of  the
principles enshrined in our Constitution.

This is in keeping with our new value system. Colleagues  will  recall  that
we raised our new national flag of the Republic of South Africa on 27  April
1994. The design  was  chosen  from  a  short  list  of  four  as  it  fully
represented the diverse colours of  flags  used  by  political  parties  and
liberation  movements  that  were  involved   in   the   negotiations   and,
subsequently, participated in the Constitutional Assembly.

The founding mothers and fathers of our Constitution believed that the  flag
design they had chosen symbolised the unity of South  Africa's  people.  The
people of South Africa have demonstrated their national  pride  by  hoisting
the flag at important events. We all know what  happens  when  we  have  big
sporting events. The Department of Education together  with  the  Department
of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology will be  designing  an  educational
kit especially for students, informing them how the flag should be used  and
handled. There is a convergence of the concept informing the design  of  the
flag and the words reflected in the coat of  arms,  which  really  advocates
unity in diversity.

The national coat of arms is the highest visual symbol of the state.  It  is
also a central part of the great seal traditionally  considered  to  be  the
highest symbol of the state. Absolute power is given to every document  with
a mark of the great seal on it, as this means that it  has  the  support  of
the President of South Africa. A new coat of arms replaced the one that  had
been in service since 1910.

The coat of arms is a series of elements organised in symmetric oval  shapes
placed on top of one another. The motto  in  the  green  semicircle  is  !ke
e:/xarra//ke, written in the Khoisan language of  the  Xam  people,  and  it
literally means ``Diverse people unite''. It calls for the nation  to  unite
in a common sense of belonging and pride, that is unity in diversity.

The elephant tusks symbolise wisdom, strength, moderation and eternity.  The
ears of wheat in the oval shape formed by  the  tusks  symbolise  fertility,
growth and the development of potential, the nourishment of people  and  the
agricultural aspects  of  the  earth.  The  shape  of  the  gold  shield  is
drumlike. It has a dual function, the  display  of  identity  and  spiritual
defence.

The human figures from Khoisan  art,  derived  from  images  on  the  famous
Linton Stone, the primary example of African rock art, now  in  one  of  our
museums, demonstrate an attitude of greeting and  unity,  symbolising  again
unity in diversity. The protea, an emblem of the beauty of our land and  the
flowering  of  our  potential  as  a  nation,  in  pursuit  of  the  African
Renaissance, symbolises the holistic integration of forces  that  grow  from
earth, nurtured above. The rising sun, a  symbol  of  brightness  and  glow,
symbolises the promise of rebirth, the active faculties of reflection,  good
judgment and willpower.

I would like to use this occasion and call on all South  Africans  to  rally
behind the campaign for popularising our national symbols. I would  like  to
say  that  our  national  anthem  also  symbolises  unity   and   consensus,
reconstructed from the previous national anthem combined  with  the  popular
Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. We must strive to  build  a  nation  at  peace  with
itself, determined to succeed notwithstanding its difficulties.

Colleagues,  let  us  draw  inspiration  from  our  President.  During   his
inauguration, this is what he said:


  No longer capable of being falsely  defined  as  a  European  outpost  in
  Africa, we are an African nation, in the complex process, simultaneously,
  of formation and renewal, and in that process we  will  seek  to  educate
  both the young and ourselves about everything all our forebearers did  to
  uphold the torch of freedom.
We, too, as the people of South Africa and  Africa  must  together  run  our
``comrades marathon''. [Time expired.]

Mnr S E OPPERMAN: Voorsitter, een  van  die  veeleisendste  wedlope  op  die
atletiekprogram is die hinderniswedloop. Dit is 'n wedloop oor hoë  hekkies,
deur watergate en dit is lank en uitputtend. Dit kos aanhou en  uithou.  Dit
vra stamina en deursettingsvermoë net om klaar te maak;  en  ons  praat  nie
eens van wen nie. Dit is waarmee  ek  die  moeisame  pad  van  transformasie
vergelyk. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr S E OPPERMAN: Chairperson, one  of  the  most  demanding  races  on  the
athletics programme is the  steeplechase  race.  It  is  a  race  over  high
hurdles, through waterjumps and it  is  long  and  exhausting.  It  requires
perseverance and staying-power. It requires stamina and persistence just  to
finish the race, let alone win it. This is  what  I  compare  the  laborious
road of transformation to.]

Transformation is not a slogan. It  cannot  be  a  form  of  retaliation  or
another form of discrimination. It must  be  a  change  for  the  better;  a
comprehensive change; a profound change; a  planned  change;  a  progressive
change; a fundamental change from what we had  to  what  we  want  and  from
where we are coming from to where we want to go!

Therefore I believe  we  need  to  reach  consensus  on  what  is  meant  by
transformation. If our destination is equal opportunities  for  every  South
African regardless of race or language, creed or political  affiliation;  if
we extend opportunities to all  sections  of  the  population  by  improving
education and job creation through a growing economy; if we are  willing  to
turn our back once and for all on  state-sponsored  racism,  then  and  only
then can we speak of a fundamental change and use the term transformation.

If it is still general  practice  to  kill  one's  political  opponents,  to
destroy the houses of those one does not agree with ...

Met die indien van mosies het ons gehoor daar was heelwat  teenkanting  teen
uitsettings, maar ons het getuienis van mense wat nie net uitgesit is nie  -
hulle huise is vernietig. Hulle enigste sonde is omdat hulle  aan  'n  ander
politieke party behoort. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[When  motions  were  submitted  we  heard  that  there   was   considerable
opposition to evictions, but we  have  evidence  of  people  that  were  not
merely evicted - their houses were destroyed as well.  Their  only  sin  was
that they belonged to another political party.]

So, we need to mobilise. But if we mobilise unconstitutionally to  keep  our
opponents out of specific areas, the no-go areas, then we  are  far  removed
from what we so easily call transformation.  Minister  Zuma  spoke  about  a
commitment against terrorism. I think we must show  our  commitment  against
terrorism by dealing decisively with these issues.

For  real  transformation  to  take  place,   we   must   commit   ourselves
passionately to promoting the establishment and the maintenance of  an  open
society in South Africa, founded on the principles of liberty,  justice  and
equality, the values of merit, individual responsibility - that is  a  vital
part of transformation - tolerance of dissent and differences, fairness  and
compassion. This,  to  me,  is  the  essence  of  what  we  want  in  a  new
dispensation. It is different from what we had. This is where we should  go.
We cannot return to where we are coming from!

Some of us must define or redefine  our  values,  beliefs,  ideas,  customs,
concepts and identities. For others it may imply a paradigm shift  in  value
systems.

Sommige van ons sal oor die hekkie moet spring  van  arrogante,  impulsiewe,
politieke domastrantheid. Vir ander wag daar 'n hoër hekkie  van  arrogante,
intellektuele,  politieke  snobisme!  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Some of us will have to clear the hurdle of arrogant, impulsive,  political
insolence. For others an  even  higher  hurdle  of  arrogant,  intellectual,
political snobbism waits!]

The more specific question before us this afternoon is: How can we  use  our
heritage as a tool, a vehicle or  leverage  to  assist  in  the  process  of
transformation in order to reconstruct and develop? I believe  our  heritage
can be a powerful tool if it  is  based  on  truth,  and  not  on  political
manipulation.

As ons bereid is om ons self te  gee,  ons  taal,  ons  kultuurgoedere,  die
erfenis wat aan ons toevertrou is, kan ons die basis lê om 'n beter  erfenis
oor te dra  na  die  volgende  geslag.  [If  we  are  prepared  to  give  of
ourselves, our language, our cultural inheritance,  the  heritage  that  was
entrusted to us, we can lay the foundation to hand over  a  better  heritage
to the next generation.]

We owe it to the next generation to take them to higher grounds,  to  better
opportunities and stronger foundations on which they can continue  the  work
that has been started. We must not underestimate the role that each  one  of
us can play and we must not frustrate others  in  the  role  that  they  can
play.

Wanneer ons ons taal gebruik, laat ons dit met die  regte  motiewe  gebruik.
Nie om te ondermyn, nie om inligting weg te steek nie, nie  om  ander  mense
te probeer verneder nie. Wanneer ons ons kultuur beoefen, laat ons dit  doen
sonder om hoogmoedig neer te sien op ander kulture; asof  dit  minderwaardig
sou wees. Wanneer ons ons geskiedenis voorhou, laat ons dit  nie  doen  asof
ons vlekkeloos uit die stryd  getree  het  nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[When we use our language, let us use it with  the  right  motives.  Not  to
undermine, not to hide information, not to try to  humiliate  other  people.
When we practise our culture, let us do so without scornfully  looking  down
on other cultures, as if they were inferior. When we  present  our  history,
let us not do so as if we stepped out of the struggle blameless.]

Let us all, in humility,  acknowledge  our  own  shortcomings  and  use  our
culture to support the  values  of  our  Constitution,  for  example,  human
dignity, nonracialism, nonsexism, the supremacy of the Constitution and  the
rule of law. Let us ensure accountability, responsiveness and openness.  Let
each  one  of  us  commit  ourselves  to  take  the  small  step   to   real
transformation, a  small  step  that  can  be  a  giant  leap  for  mankind.
[Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Chairperson, on behalf of the IFP it gives me great  pleasure
to explore the topic: Heritage day - the road to a transformed society.  The
Scots have a song of someone taking the high road and  someone  else  taking
the low road. Metaphorically, our high road is the moral road, the  road  to
a secure future, to fulfilment and happiness. This is the road we  in  South
Africa should be taking. In the above context, Heritage Day  offers  all  of
us as South Africans the opportunity to take the  high  road  leading  to  a
transformed society.

The question is: Do we need our society to be  transformed?  The  answer  is
that we certainly do.  Outwardly  it  would  appear  that  we  are  a  fully
transformed society. Ask if there is  anyone  who  supports  apartheid,  and
there is no one who will  respond  positively  to  the  question.  Yet,  the
hidden impulses that shape  our  thoughts  and  direct  our  actions  reveal
themselves from time to time. These actions are as ugly as  any  which  were
sanctioned by apartheid.

Many people look backward and yearn for the political system  that  is  dead
and buried. Though we have freedom  and  rights  at  a  level  never  before
enjoyed in our country, we do not uniformly and together celebrate with  joy
and affirmation this freedom that we  have.  Celebrating  our  freedom,  the
kind of thing the Deputy Minister spoke about, and the need to look  at  our
new heritage in the making  does  not  mean  that  we  should  overlook  the
mindless and pervasive violence that expresses itself  daily  in  cruel  and
brutal ways.

We have our freedom. We also have our problems. We are one of the freest  of
societies in the world,  and  yet  we  are  also  one  of  the  most  brutal
societies in the world. Some of our citizens walk  the  high  road;  others,
unfortunately, still walk the low road. Yet we have the answer.

The  answer,  as  we  all  know,  is  ubuntu.  Traditional  leaders,   whose
continuity we support, know and understand the significance of  ubuntu.  The
high road to a transformed society begins with the  transformed  individual.
This requires that we infuse  our  hearts  and  minds,  vision,  philosophy,
daily transactions, prayers and deep understanding with  ubuntu.  This  also
requires that our education and politics should be  rooted  in  ubuntu  and,
thereafter, should feed all the processes with ubuntu.

We, as members here, have spoken of ubuntu before,  and  pleaded  with  each
other and fellow South Africans to become proponents  and  practitioners  of
ubuntu.  Ubuntu  is  a  manifestation  of  mutuality,  and  mutuality  is  a
manifestation of ubuntu. Until this mutuality is  deeply  infused  into  our
beings, we shall be outwardly civil  to  each  other  but  inwardly  harbour
savage intentions towards each other though we are fellow South Africans.

The future turns on whether on not ubuntu  finds  a  way  into  our  hearts,
minds and souls. Bitterness, anger, racist prejudices, unwillingness to  let
go of thoughts, dreams and ideas that are no longer in conformity  with  our
Constitution pose as much of a threat to us and the future as do the  people
who seek to terrorise and attack us daily. As a new  country,  unwilling  to
have anything to do with the legacy of the past, we have the urgent need  to
create a new heritage that will be proudly received by generations  not  yet
born. That is our duty and that, happily, is also our privilege.

For seven years, we in the IFP have been asked what underpins our  political
philosophy, conduct and expression. The answer is ubuntu. For  seven  years,
we have been asked about our expectations for the future. Unwaveringly,  our
big vision for South Africa is that our Constitution  should  dovetail  with
the practice of ubuntu. Ubuntu is the road to  a  transformed  society.  For
me, my colleagues, hon members and all of South Africa ubuntu  is  the  high
road. Ubuntu is the way forward.

No one can  transform  society  from  the  top.  We  heard,  today,  in  the
education debate, about the need to transform - the manifest  need  to  make
sure  that  the  institutions  of  our  land  are  transformed.   But   that
transformation will never happen as long as we remain,  in  our  own  hearts
and thoughts, untransformed.  No  transformation  can  come  from  the  top.
Transformation can only come from the inside. If the heart wills,  the  will
will take heart, and this is the issue that Heritage Day presents to  us  as
South Africans.

Are we now ready, after seven years, to negate  the  legacies  of  the  past
completely, to make a new beginning to find each other and one another in  a
rare opportunity of the kind of unity that the  Deputy  Minister  spoke  of?
Until we begin in our minds to consent to  this  willingness  to  transform,
transformation cannot take place.

I would like to thank the Chief Whip for  the  opportunity  to  be  able  to
raise this issue and I do hope, plead and beg  that  all  of  us  will  take
ubuntu as the basis for transformation in South Africa. [Applause.]

Mr S SIMMONS: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order,  whilst  the  hon  member
Opperman was speaking, hon member Hangana said:  ``We  will  kill  you.''  I
just want to know if this is parliamentary.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Hangana, did you say that?

Ms N E HANGANA: Chairperson, yes, it was a political statement.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Could you withdraw that.

Ms N E HANGANA: I beg your pardon.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Could you withdraw that?

Ms N E HANGANA: Yes, I shall withdraw it. I am not your Hangana, wena!

Ms H M MPAKA: Chairperson,  members  of  Parliament  and  Ministers,  it  is
crucial for us to understand  the  meaning  of  Heritage  Day  celebrations.
September 24 was marked in the calendar of the  old  regime  as  Shaka  Day.
With the  ushering  in  of  the  new  democratic,  nonracial  and  nonsexist
Government in November 1994, which is led  by  the  ANC,  24  September  was
liberated and transformed into a day of reconciliation and nation-building.

It is intended to build unity amongst  our  people,  irrespective  of  race,
colour and creed. A date which in the past was used to  emphasise  ethnicity
and racialism and to  celebrate  the  humiliation  of  one  section  of  our
community, was liberated  and  given  a  new  aura  by  our  new  democratic
Government.
A country's heritage is that part of  its  background  or  environment  that
shapes its identity. It includes that country's history and the  way  it  is
told by its people, its culture, arts, crafts and  language;  the  food  its
people prefer, the music they make and the way its  buildings  are  designed
and built. In South Africa a rich  blend  of  different  forms  of  heritage
makes our people unique in the world. Our heritage sets us apart from  other
nations and allows us to stand out as a uniquely proud nation.

Although South Africans have diverse cultures, elements of  national  unity,
nation-building,  reconciliation   and   national   patriotism   should   be
emphasised. The ideal is to preserve, exhibit and promote  our  diverse  but
connected cultures. Heritage Day should encourage the youth, in  particular,
to embrace South Africa's common heritage.

Ukuthabathela  phezulu  amagugu  nelifa  lethu   yinto   ebaluleke   kakhulu
ekwakheni nasekuphuhliseni uMzantsi Afrika. [Honouring  our  heritage  is  a
very significant factor in building and developing South Africa.]

Our national anthem Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika,  Maluphakanyisw'  uphondo  lwayo
[Lord, bless Africa, May her spirit rise high up] - so truly  did  the  hymn
speak of the time that it was taken up by the people, in what  became  South
Africa and far beyond its borders.

Nkosi Sikelela is, then, a  hymn  born  of  the  clash  of  vast  historical
forces. But what a hymn it is, this simple appeal for  national  redemption,
for continental salvation.

Morena boloka is not a clarion call to arms. It is not an incitement to  the
barricade or a scream for revenge.

God sëen Afrika might have warmed the blood  of  slaves  with  the  fire  of
faith, but it is not a tune of glory to the might of one over the other.  It
has always been an ode to  peace,  a  celebration  of  human  solidarity  in
diversity.
Lord bless Africa speaks quietly,  only  of  thanks  and  blessing  for  the
people, their teachers and the land we live in. It is  a  prayer  for  crops
and rain, for harvest, health and peace for all.

It unites  towns  and  countryside,  workers  and  professionals,  students,
teachers  and  those  without   formal   education,   religions   of   every
denomination and those with  no  formal  religion.  The  vision  which  once
sustained the oppressed now unites all in our liberated nation.

And so today we celebrate Enoch Sontonga's gift to us, a heroic  message  of
calm, written in the eye of the storm. Today it forms part of  our  national
anthem, and along with Die Stem, it embellishes various strands of our  past
in a unison of inclusiveness, of the oneness of South Africa's people.

During colonial and apartheid times our museums and monuments reflected  the
experiences and political ideas of a minority, to the exclusion  of  others.
Many people had little or no say  in  the  depiction  of  their  history  in
textbooks, libraries or research institutions.

The demeaning portrayal of black people in particular, viz  African,  Indian
and coloured people, is painful to  recall.  Of  all  our  museums,  only  a
handful represented the kind of heritage which glorified  mainly  white  and
colonial history. Even the small glimpse of black history in the others  was
largely fixed in the grip of racist and other stereotypes.

Whilst museums in the past served the interests of the few citizens  of  the
country, they are now expected to reposition themselves so that  they  serve
the entire South African population. Unfortunately, we have  to  acknowledge
that the redressing of this situation has barely began.

Having excluded and marginalised most of our people, is it  surprising  that
our museums and national monuments are often seen as alien spaces? How  many
have gone to see one of  our  monuments?  In  other  countries  such  places
throng with citizens.
Through the apartheid years people responded to the  denial  and  distortion
of their heritage with their own  affirmation  as,  indeed,  Afrikaners  had
done in an earlier period. They celebrated their  heritage  outside  of  the
country's museums and monuments - in song and in ceremony, in festivals  and
carnivals, in the selling of their own wares and in buying items  associated
with their heritage, and by working the history of  their  communities  into
everyday artifacts, as the women of Hlabisa weave their  stories  into  beer
baskets.

With democracy we have the  opportunity  to  ensure  that  our  institutions
reflect history in a way that respects the heritage of all our citizens.

Owayesakuba  ngumongameli  wokuqala  eBotswana,  uMhlekazi  Seretse   Khama,
wathi, ndiyacaphula:


  ... isizwe esingena kamva sisizwe esilahlekileyo,  nabantu  abangenakamva
  ngabantu abangenamphefumlo.
(Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[The first president of Botswana, the hon Sir  Seretse  Khama  said,  and  I
quote:


  ... a nation without a future is no nation, and people who have no future
  have no life.]

Government has taken up the challenge. Our museums and the heritage  sector,
as a whole, are being restructured. Community  consultation,  effective  use
of limited resources and accessibility are  our  guiding  principles  as  we
seek to redress the imbalances.

Owayesakuba  nguMongameli  weli,  uMnu  Nelson  Mandela,   kwintetho   yakhe
yokubhiyozela   uSuku   lweMveli   ngenyanga   kaSeptemba   ku-1995   wathi,
ndiyacaphula: (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[The then president of South Africa, the  hon  Mr  Nelson  Mandela,  in  his
speech on celebrating Heritage Day in the month  of  September  1995,  said,
and I quote:]


  ... South Africa, for the first time as a country, can  look  back  as  a
  united nation on our past in order to help build on a common future.

He  said  that  the  time  had  come  for  us  to  work  towards  a   common
understanding of our past, one that all South Africans could identify  with.
He said:


  That task is crucial to the reconstruction of our country. It is part  of
  the healing of our society and the restoration of its dignity.

The  recently   established   legacy   project   will   promote   a   fuller
representation of our nation's heritage through new monuments, and  preserve
the whole of our diverse heritage. When they invite the public and  interact
with the changes all around them, they will  strengthen  our  attachment  to
human rights, mutual respect and democracy,  and  help  prevent  these  from
ever again being violated.

When Cabinet decided that Robben Island should be developed  as  a  national
monument and national museum, it  set  in  motion  its  redevelopment  as  a
cultural and conservation showcase for South Africa's democracy, which  will
also maximise its educational potential. Today,  the  second  phase  of  the
Island's redevelopment begins.  This  ceremony  confirms  for  us  that  the
struggle for  human  dignity  and  freedom  throughout  the  world  and,  in
particular, in South Africa, is an ongoing one.

The new coat of arms replaces the one that  served  South  Africa  since  17
September 1910, as the Deputy Minister has indicated.  The  change  reflects
Government's aim to highlight the democratic change in South  Africa  and  a
new sense of patriotism.

In conclusion, symbols have been  used  as  an  easy  method  of  democratic
empowerment, especially for those South Africans who have for so  long  been
excluded from most of the decision-making processes  in  this  country.  The
symbols of political parties were  used  in  the  1994  elections  for  easy
identification on ballot papers.

The three primary  national  symbols  that  were  mentioned  by  the  Deputy
Minister represent this new democracy and replace  all  previous  equivalent
symbols. Key values underpinning  these  new  symbols  are:  reconciliation,
unity in diversity and nation-building.

Through  these  symbols  every  South  African  is  encouraged,   mobilised,
energised and inspired to own the process  of  taking  this  nation  from  a
divided past to a unified future. I think it will be wrong  for  me  not  to
mention our flag ...

... iflegi yesizwe.  Kuya  kukhunjulwa  ukuba  iflegi  yethu  entsha  saqala
ukuyisebenzisa ngomhla wama-27  kuApreli  ka-1994,  kanye  ngexesha  ekwathi
ngalo kwazalwa ngokutsha esi sizwe. Imibala yale flegi  ibonakalisa  imibala
eyintloko kwimbali ukusukela mhla mnene ukuza kuthi ga ngoku.  Kwakhona,  le
mibala ayina ntsingiselo inye.  Ngokwesigqibo  sangethuba  leengxoxo,  ubani
nobani unelungelo lokunika  intsingiselo  yakhe  malunga  nokuba  le  mibala
imele ntoni na.

Umbindi wale  flegi  uqala  ngenkangeleko  kanobumba  u-v,  wehle  njengomcu
ongajongwa  njengobonakalisa  ukuhlangana  kunye  koluntu  loMzantsi  Afrika
lungena kwindlela eya phambili njengeqela  elinye.  Oku  kuhambelana  twatse
nomxholo  we-Mbasa  yeSizwe  yethu  entsha   ethi:   ``Abantu   abohlukileyo
bayamanyana.'' [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[... the national flag. It will be remember that we started using  our  flag
on 27 April 1994 at a time when this country  was  reborn.  The  colours  of
this flag are an indication of their significance in  the  history  of  this
country. Furthermore, these colours do not have one  meaning.  According  to
the negotiations, everyone has a right to attach his or her meaning  to  the
colours.

The middle of this flag appears like a `v', and it  goes  down  showing  the
people of South Africa taking the same route towards unity. This is  exactly
in line with what is symbolised by the coat of arms, that, ``People who  are
diverse could be united.'' [Applause.]]
Mev A VAN WYK: Mnr die Voorsitter, die ramp wat  Amerika  en  die  beskaafde
wêreld getref het, gee aan die herdenking van Erfenisdag  dieper  betekenis.
Dit is duidelik dat ná die val van kommunisme,  groot  beskawingsgroeperinge
hul in nuwe posisies bevind. Formele simboliek  ondergaan  'n  hernuwing  as
samesnoerende elemente in  moderne  state  wat  ruimte  moet  skep  vir  die
toenemende bewuswording en belangrikheid van  diverse  kultuur  identiteite.
Deur   die   grubeelde   oor   die   internasionale   TV   heen,   het   die
alomteenwoordigheid  van  die   Amerikaanse   `stars   and   stripes',   die
belangrikheid van nasionale simbole tuisgebring soos nooit tevore nie.

Oral waar 'n  nasie  'n  gevoel  van  onderlinge  gebondenheid  en  gedeelde
lotservaring beleef, in vreugde óf smart, soek hy 'n  simbool  wat  dit  kan
sein en waarby hy hom kan skaar. Simbole speel só 'n rol  waar  die  burgers
van  'n  land  die  geborgenheid  van  nasieskap  ervaar,  en  waarvan   die
bindweefsels onbetwiste aanvaarding van  'n  gedeelde  waardestelsel  is  en
waar almal met vertroue kan glo hul owerheid streef om  hierdie  waardes  te
handhaaf en uit te bou.  Dít  is  die  soort  omvorming  wat  in  die  Suid-
Afrikaanse samelewing dringend noodsaaklik is. Ons  waardestelsel  berus  op
ons erfenis, die demokrasie, en dit is die  vernaamste  instrument  tot  ons
beskikking om Suid-Afrika te omvorm tot 'n nasie van  wenners.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs A VAN WYK: Mr Chairperson, the disaster that  struck  America  and  the
civilised world gives a deeper meaning  to  the  commemoration  of  Heritage
Day. It is evident that, after the fall of  communism,  large  groupings  of
civilisation  find  themselves  in  new  positions.  Formal   symbolism   is
undergoing a renewal as elements of co-ordinating forces  in  modern  states
that must create an opportunity for the increasing awareness and  importance
of  diverse  cultural  identities.  With  the   horror   images   shown   on
international TV the ubiquitousness of the American Stars  and  Stripes  has
brought home the importance of national symbols like never before.

Whenever a nation experiences a feeling  of  mutual  solidarity  and  common
destiny, in happiness or sorrow, it seeks a symbol that can signal this  and
with which it can associate itself.  Symbols  play  such  a  role  when  the
citizens of  a  country  experience  the  security  of  nationhood,  binding
elements of which amount to an acceptance  of  a  shared  value  system,  in
which everybody can confidently believe that their  government  is  striving
to  uphold  these  values  and  to  promote  them.  It  is  this   kind   of
transformation that is urgently needed in South African society.  Our  value
system is based on our heritage, democracy, and that is the  most  important
instrument at our disposal to  transform  South  Africa  into  a  nation  of
winners.]

South Africa is the proud custodian in Africa  of  this  great  inheritance.
There are many moments in history that punctuate the arduous path  travelled
before  democracy,  as  a  civilised  system  to  regulate  the  affairs  of
humankind came into being.

In die Middeleeue reeds, is een van die  boustene  van  liberale  demokrasie
neergelê. Feodalisme het die regte van leenmanne beskerm teen die regte  van
leenhere, met ander woorde die regte van die magtiges is beperk  waar  mense
in 'n ongelyke verhouding tot mekaar gestaan het. In die  politieke  gisting
van die Franse Revolusie, is die  beginsel  van  etiese  gelykheid  vir  die
eerste keer erken. Ander groot momente sluit in die vrystelling  van  slawe.
Nog 'n bousteen is die verklaring van  menseregte  in  1948.  'n  Belangrike
deel   van   die   uitbouing   van   menseregte   tans,    is    die    vele
verklaringsmanifeste en aktes wat die regte van minderhede  oor  die  wêreld
erken en bevorder. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[As long ago as the Middle Ages  one  of  the  building  blocks  of  liberal
democracy was established. Feudalism protected the rights of feudal  tenants
against the rights of feudal  lords,  in  other  words  the  rights  of  the
powerful  were  limited  where  people  found  themselves  in   an   unequal
relationship. With the  political  ferment  of  the  French  Revolution  the
principle of ethical equality was  recognised  for  the  first  time.  Other
major moments include the emancipation of slaves. Another building block  is
the declaration of human rights in 1948. Currently,  an  important  part  of
the promotion of human rights is the many declaration  manifestos  and  acts
that recognise and promote the rights of minorities throughout the world.]

There are many, possibly as yet unrecognised, moments of  transformation  in
South African history inspired by democratic striving. The  American  author
James Brice called the old Free State a model state in  recognition  of  the
human rights charter  included  in  its  constitution  of  1854.  The  ANC's
Freedom Charter contains many of the basic elements of a  modern  democracy.
Another  important  milestone   of   democratic   transformation   was   the
recognition of the rights of workers by the establishment  of  trade  unions
in the 1970s, based on the Wiehahn Commission's findings.

The public debate that ensued in the 1980s over political and  human  rights
for all South Africans, resulted in the abolition in  the  1980s  and  early
1990s of the building  blocks  of  apartheid.  Despite  apartheid,  strongly
democratic institutions existed,  such  as  an  independent  judiciary.  The
Group Areas Act collapsed, in no small  measure  as  a  consequence  of  the
verdict in the Govender case of 1982, which determined that  the  state  had
to provide equal alternative accommodation.

Great importance was given to the coming liberalisation  of  this  state  by
the yes vote in the 1992 referendum. When  F  W  de  Klerk  released  Nelson
Mandela and unbanned the liberation movements, this paved the  way  for  our
sitting down together to draft the Constitution of  the  Republic  of  South
Africa, which encapsulates the democratic striving of  the  people  of  this
country.

It is this heritage we must protect  and  develop.  Ignorance,  poverty  and
crime are the enemies of our fledgling democracy. Wherever  ugliness,  dirt,
disease, misery, hate speech and incitement  flourish,  despair  and  danger
also flourish. Wherever irresponsibility  and  indifference,  arrogance  and
corruption flourish, resentment and recklessness also flourish.

The wounds struck in the body politic of South Africa  over  the  centuries,
are barely healed. In transforming South Africa into a properly  functioning
democracy, let us lend a hand in the fight against terrorism and fulfil  our
leadership responsibilities in the subcontinent to eradicate the causes  and
breeding grounds of violence and destruction.

The day South Africa can say, in the words of Thomas Paine:


  ... my poor are happy, neither ignorance nor  distress  is  to  be  found
  among them, my jails are empty of prisoners, my streets of  beggars,  the
  aged are not in want, the taxes are not oppressive, the rational world is
  my friend because I am a friend of its happiness ...

We shall have taken our place among our peers  in  the  rational  world;  we
shall have rejected the forces of evil; and we  shall  have  achieved  real,
time-honoured transformation. [Applause.]

Ms A VAN WYK: Chairperson, Heritage Day, on 24 September, is a day on  which
we celebrate what each of us considers to be significant to our past,  where
we come from, who we are, where we are now and, most importantly,  where  we
are going. We come from diverse pasts, not merely in terms of the  languages
that we speak at home, the cultural group that we feel ourselves part of  or
our social economic status in life,  but  most  of  all,  our  very  diverse
political background.

For years our society was divided into the oppressed and the oppressor,  the
haves and the have-nots, the minority that  controlled  and  determined  the
politics for and on behalf of the majority. All of this  changed  after  the
first democratic elections, in 1994. Or did it? Are we really a  transformed
society, seven years down the  line,  or  have  we  simply  substituted  one
regime with another? The answer is not one that this  Chamber  can  provide.
The answer for this we can only get from  the  millions  of  South  Africans
whom, collectively, all of us in this House represent.

I believe that in order for South  Africa  to  become  a  truly  transformed
society, a few basic things need to be done. The  first  is  addressing  the
economy. The wealth of our country needs  to  be  distributed  more  evenly.
This should be done by increasing the wealth  resources  that  we  have  and
involving more people in participating in the  economic  activities  in  the
country. South Africa needs a  second  liberation:  an  economic  liberation
that will empower all South Africans with equal opportunities, to share  and
participate in the active economy.

The second is a political transformation, which will require  from  us  that
we break free from our voting patterns of the past and  allow  ourselves  to
mature in our democratic  practice  of  choice.  The  four  free  democratic
elections that we have had since 1994, clearly indicate that South  Africans
still vote along racial lines.

All parties have a role to play and every citizen  in  South  Africa  has  a
responsibility to realise that democracy means that I can,  may  and  should
make a different political choice from the one  that  I  have  made  before.
This is how we, as ordinary  citizens,  indicate  to  governments  -  local,
national and provincial - whether we  are  satisfied  with  the  quality  of
governance that they are providing us with.

Political transformation simply means judging the performance of your  party
of choice, and then taking  the  responsibility,  by  using  your  vote,  of
sending  them  an  assessment  of  their  performance.  It  does  not   mean
disloyalty. It requires  courage  and  commitment,  and  this  House  has  a
responsibility to ensure the freedom and right  of  each  South  African  to
make that choice. It is only once we can  break  free  from  racial  divides
that determine our voting patterns, that we will be on our way  to  a  truly
transformed society.

Lastly, we need to look at  social  transformation.  It  is  here  that  our
heritage comes into play once again. We cannot deny who we are -  we  should
not. It should not be expected of any person to deny who he or she  is,  and
where he or she comes from. We are a diverse nation. We  speak  11  official
languages. We look different, pray differently and our cultures differ.

All of these things form part of our heritage.  Each  of  these  differences
makes up the colours that define the rainbow nation. If we  force  a  single
person or group of people to  deny  part  of  their  heritage,  we  will  be
detracting from these colours that make up the rainbow.

Our diversity is our strength. It is our nation's heritage and  provides  us
with a melting pot of ideas, creativity and  opportunities.  It  is  a  rich
tapestry. But if  one  stands  too  close,  one  will  only  see  individual
stitches in their different colours, on their own  not  making  much  sense.
But, it is when one take a few steps back and sees the full beauty  of  that
tapestry that one realises the value and  contribution  of  each  individual
stitch to the aesthetic value of the final product.

To put  SA  truly  on  the  road  to  a  transformed  society,  we  need  to
concentrate more on our shared values, that which we have  in  common,  than
on our differences. What we do, say and decide today, how we act ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Ms A VAN WYK: ... and interact with each other, will  not  merely  disappear
into oblivion. The actions, decisions and  statements  that  we  make  today
will become the heritage of tomorrow's generation. [Time expired.]

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  before   I
recognise the next speaker, let me say that  Hansard  can  only  record  one
speaker at a time. And hon members who are expending extra energy trying  to
be heard, I am afraid, will not be recorded in Hansard.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairman, our South  African  heritage  is  a  legacy  in  the
making. This heritage is still in its infancy and like  any  infant,  it  is
vulnerable. On this road  we  have  already  witnessed  the  miraculous,  as
apartheid crumbled  in  a  climate  of  relative  peace  and  a  desire  for
reconciliation gripped the hearts of most South Africans.

The road, however, has been a rocky  one  with  many  detours  and  dangers.
Realities such as unemployment, currently running at between  25%  and  35%,
and crime, are serious concerns  for  ordinary  people.  Whilst  few  people
would  question  the  link  between  apartheid  and  current  backlogs   and
inequalities,  constant  reference  to  the  past,  apportioning  blame  and
focusing all efforts on exorcising racism, as tempting as this may be,  will
not deal with the situation.

The fact is that there can be no real or lasting  reconciliation  of  racial
or other differences outside of Jesus Christ, the Lord of lords and King  of
kings. Division was God's response to man's efforts to unify outside of  Him
in the past. Is it not glaringly obvious that this  is  still  His  response
today?

The world has had a very loud wake up call as we watched  symbols  of  world
power and  world  trade  come  crashing  to  the  ground  in  New  York  and
Washington. The genius of men and women is no substitute for the  protection
of an Almighty God.

Sadly and shamefully, South Africa is building a heritage  not  unlike  that
of the United States, in murdering her unborn children, flooding  our  homes
with  every  kind  of  debauchery,  teaching  our  children  to   disrespect
authority  and  even  their  own   bodies,   embracing   homosexuality   and
prostitution, and much more.

The roots  of  civilisation  are  only  one  generation  deep  and  if  that
generation forgets  the  truth  and  fails  to  understand  the  lessons  of
history, it can easily revert to the barbarism of the past,  or  perhaps  an
enhanced barbarism, as we witnessed in the attacks on the USA,  enhanced  by
the technological marvels of the age.

Without God, existence becomes meaningless and moral values  are  arbitrary.
Where are we headed on this road? How will we respond? [Time expired.]

Mrs T J TSHIVHASE: Chairperson, I  am  happy  that  at  least  some  of  the
speakers know what heritage means.

[Chairperson, young people get support from the elderly.  A  nation  without
its elders is a lost nation. Elderly people are a total expression of  being
a society. We have idioms and  proverbs  which  show  the  richness  of  the
language, eg people should  share.  This  idiomatic  expression  shows  that
there is democracy and the policy of communism amongst our people.

If our elderly people were not there, where would our young  generation  get
these values? They need to be appreciated and rewarded for the  wealth  they
left us. They are our living treasures. Their knowledge should be  recorded,
so that it can be passed from one generation to the next.

Our  former  president,  Nelson  Mandela,  played  an  important   role   in
reconciliation. Oom Gov Mbeki as well, fought for our  liberation.  Tourists
arrive from far away, coming to see Shaka's grave, geographical  names  such
as Mandela Drive in Tswane city, Beyers Naude received the  freedom  of  the
city of Johannesburg, a reward for his contribution  towards  reconciliation
and transformation. Tourism as well, should promote the  creativity  of  our
people.]

The Government is putting a lot of funds in the SABC which should cover  the
rural poor, so as to get the messages from our elderly. Instead,  the  media
covers  urban  areas  where  they  think  there  is  a  market.   Therefore,
transformation is very slow in the media sector. The language of any  nation
or society plays a central role in societies or nations.  All  developmental
issues are an integral part of  language.  Examples  are  communication  and
life skills for survival objectives. We impart knowledge  through  language.
Through language we carry on traditions of ancestral  origin.  This  is  the
value of ubuntu, as hon member Cassim has stated.

paragraph follows.)

[In the past, languages spoken by South Africa's people were used to  divide
them. Recognising them as our heritage, has helped to transform our  mindset
and view them as a significant cord that binds us together.]

The draft language policy which encourages South Africans to know  or  learn
at least three of the official languages, will help to  eradicate  the  myth
of the existence of inferior and superior languages.

[Libraries have to be next  to  the  community  art  centres  and  serve  as
sources of information for all  people.  African  writers  should  be  given
rewards to encourage them. Information on computers should be  available  in
different languages so that everybody has access to information.  This  will
show us that we are on the right track to  transformation.  The  few  people
who were previously advantaged are still benefiting.]

We are urging scientists to create proper facilities to cater  for  language
groups which were previously disadvantaged. What can Government,  Parliament
and the communities do to ensure  that  literature  is  written  in  African
languages within the spirit of writing more  creative  books?  Our  heritage
should make us unique. This will attract people to us. If  we  look  at  the
role played by language  during  the  negotiations  to  reach  consensus  at
Codesa, we can see the importance of language, hence the  transformation  we
see.

[Culture has a role to play as a vehicle  for  transformation.  Culture  has
norms and values. Apartheid kept us separated.  If  we  look  at  vocational
education, different people now talk to each other.

The ANC believes in power through peace. If one treats other people the  way
one treat one's own people, that is real transformation.  This  is  what  is
needed in socialisation by celebrating this Heritage Day.

In some groups when people greet one  another,  one  is  supposed  to  kneel
down, whereas the other one must be  standing.  Even  though  we  differ  in
culture, we are one South African nation  which  must  be  united.  In  most
instances when Venda man is walking,  he  wants  to  see  his  wife  walking
behind him, whereas a white man wants to see her walking in  front  of  him.
According to these men, this is done for protection and it is in  accordance
with their cultures.]

Let our artists portray African creativity, and  not  be  seen  as  barbaric
artists. Through art one portrays one's identity. We all know that there  is
a portrayal of job creation in African culture  through  the  creativity  of
our rural women who are surviving on what they have. We  must  be  proud  of
what we wear, for example our jewellery and our dresses.  They  have  to  be
promoted, and not just  be  taken  for  granted.  These  women  need  to  be
encouraged by having beauty contests  or  fashion  parades  featuring  their
products.

We in the ANC still believe that South Africans should join hands  to  build
this country together. That is why we  are  celebrating  this  Heritage  Day
today. Let us join hands together and be united as Africans.

[When we look at all South Africans, there is something similar about  them,
more especially when it comes to culture. Respect  and  living  together  is
what these people or the dead, died for, so that their land can develop  and
so that we can live as one.

We all know that we are here because other people shed their blood  for  the
freedom we are enjoying now. I believe that we are not here for nothing  and
that the blood was not shed for nothing, but  we  should  live  together  as
South Africans who are united. We are  South  Africans,  therefore  we  must
live together in harmony. [Applause.]]

Mr M T GONIWE: Chairperson, on a point of order:  Apart  from  the  pathetic
interpretation services, these gadgets are not working. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, I  thought  it  was
only the device which I had which was malfunctioning.  I  thought  you  were
generally being better serviced.  Let  me  assure  you  that  the  presiding
officers have put out to tender the need to  improve  the  sound  system  in
this Chamber. I think I can ask for you forbearance. In due course you  will
have sound that will be of an adequate quality here.

In the meantime I must apologise for the sound. As for the  quality  of  the
interpretation, I think you are sitting right next to  the  best  person  to
possibly attempt to see if that could be improved.  So,  I  take  both  your
points.

Mr J H SLABBERT: Chairperson, on a point of order: Will the closing date  of
that tender be before 2004? [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, I give you  the  assurance
that this matter is being taken in hand, and that we should  have  a  better
quality of sound. The pay-off  for  that  will  be  to  expect  hon  members
thereafter to listen to the speaker at the podium. At the moment I am  being
a little bit indulgent, seeing that the sound quality is not that good.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Mr Chairperson and hon members,  let  me  take  the  middle
course  and  say  the  advent  of  democracy  came  as  a  blessing  to  the
multicultural people of this country.

We  have  home-grown  national  symbols  to  be  proud   of:   the   interim
constitution  of  1993,  the  national  flag,  the  national  anthem,  which
embraces  different  languages  to   indicate   our   diversity;   the   new
Constitution of 1996; and the coat of arms. While we have 11  languages,  it
is unfortunate that the  nation  has  been  systematically  anglicised.  The
people's heritage in the form of their indigenous languages  is  being  kept
in the background.

There are, however, very important gains that we  should  concern  ourselves
with: the compromise national anthem is one such example. I remember when  I
spoke from this podium on the occasion of the millennium debate in  November
1999, I decried that the national anthem was  not  known  nor  was  it  well
sung. Most people remain tied to their former versions of their anthems  and
resist transformation. This  is  highly  regrettable.  The  decorum  in  the
deportment during the singing of the anthem has to improve, to show that  we
are a transformed nation that is proud of its nationhood.

It is such a pity that seven years down the road since democracy, one  still
sees the  national  flag  being  hoisted  upside  down  at  some  Government
offices. This should not happen. It tells a  very  pathetic  and  unpleasant
story. As we approach Heritage Day, may we  in  the  spirit  of  the  centre
design of the flag - which begins with a ``v'' - accept that as  peoples  of
this country there is a point where we, as diverse  elements,  converge  and
it is from this point that we can travel the road ahead in unison.

Let us come out of this journey a  transformed  society.  As  a  nation,  we
should please guard against  the  sycophant  syndrome  symbol,  which  is  a
situation that mistakes made by other people are  more  serious  than  those
made by us. This leaves us in the situation where we are seen to  be  racist
and all that.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Mr Chairperson, on the subject of the road to a  transformed
society, I want to go straight to the heart of this debate.

Land was the primary contradiction and cause of wars of national  resistance
against colonialism. They were led in this country by our heroic kings  such
as Sekhukhune, Cetywayo, Hintsa, Moshoeshoe, Makhado etc. It is  unfortunate
that thus far no progress has been made in resolving the land  dispossession
of the African people.
Section 25(7) of the Constitution has replaced the Native Land Act  of  1913
and the Native Trust Land Act of 1936. The landless  African  people,  whose
population is now nearly 78%, are homeless,  poor,  unemployed,  lack  means
for education  and  their  health  care  is  almost  nil,  especially  where
Africans live. This section must be amended.

It is political docility to think that African  land  can  be  claimed  from
1913. Homeless and landless people  have  been  evicted  from  land  without
being given alternative accommodation.  This  has  been  the  case  in  many
Bredells and Phola Parks of this country. The PAC is calling for  an  urgent
land summit as a way to  transform  this  society  and  socially  emancipate
those who the liberation struggle  against  colonialism  purported  to  free
from social degradation.

The mode of developing this country  must  change.  It  is  still  colonial.
Economic and social improvements still happen  in  the  traditionally  white
areas. This is where  the  best  development  is  concentrated  -  the  good
hospitals are here, the best schools  are  here,  the  well-equipped  police
stations are here, the best roads are here and the  best  of  everything  is
here. Meanwhile the rural  areas  and  the  townships  remain  cesspools  of
poverty and underdevelopment. The country needs  a  bottom-up  economic  and
social development, not the up-bottom one which benefits  a  tiny  minority.
[Applause.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mr Chairperson, the road to a transformed  society  starts
on the day when that society decides to move away from  living  in  conflict
with itself and its environment and leads to where they  eventually  end  up
at peace with  themselves.  It  is  a  continuous  road  along  which  every
generation of that society develops new goals and dreams - goals and  dreams
that will determine their present position in the global  society  of  their
generation.

Whilst travelling along this road the society with wise and  honest  leaders
and God-fearing families will take what was honourable from their  past  and
remould out of that their children's future. A society living  and  striving
for excellence will not repeat unjust practices committed  against  them  or
others in the past.

If every member of society strives  to  improve  his  standing  within  that
society and if every society becomes intolerant  of  corruption,  low  moral
and ethical standards, then their road to reform  will  lead  to  a  winning
nation status. Only then can such a society claim that they have reformed.

No nation can claim that they are on the road to reform when they have  only
started on this road and have not yet stopped corruption and intolerance  to
minorities or groups. No nation can point fingers  if  their  journey  along
this road still shows signs of their starting point.

If one's starting point is a scene of necklacing, crime and corruption,  and
if after years one has not yet escaped these low moral standards,  then  one
has not left the parking lot. Then one is not on the road to reform and  had
better take out the road map and replan one's route.

If we cannot curb crime and corruption  and  control  intolerance,  then  we
should not hold a Heritage Day holiday and should be out  there  building  a
better society. [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson ...

An HON MEMBER: Malibongwe! [Praise!]

Miss S  RAJBALLY:  Malibongwe  igama  lamakhosikazi!  [Praise  the  name  of
women!]

Chairperson, no matter how rich our heritage  sounds  and  is,  its  content
marks the beginning of our people, our nation, all around us. Everything  we
see, everything that exists has a story of its  own  origin,  beginning  and
inheritance - a heritage that the MF feels calls for celebration.

It had been decided, this year, that  our  national  emblems  could  be  the
theme set for Heritage Day. Our national  emblems  are  the  national  flag,
coat of arms, national anthem and national birds, animals, fish,  trees  and
flowers. Each of these has a story.
Our flag is a combination of the past  and  present  flag-history  of  South
Africa. The colours red, white and blue represent the past, and the  colours
gold, green and black mark the new. The design of the  flag  represents  our
diversities and unification, thus linking us to the national coat of arms.

Our national anthem, which is a combined version of the  republic's  earlier
anthem and the anthem of the people of the struggle, also  demonstrates  the
unity of our people. The MF respects this symbolism that  marks  our  unity,
as a nation, and the heritage of our country.

The MF finds the celebration of the nation's heritage important as it  marks
the celebration of our people, history, environment, who we are and  who  we
have become. It has been a long road and a rich history. Be it in riches  or
in struggle, Heritage Day is a day of remembrance. It  is  the  day  of  the
beginning and the future. As we look back, we look forward.

The MF celebrates the national emblems that symbolise our rich heritage  and
sees these symbols which have the content of today and yesterday as a  token
of a transformed society. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson,  when  Cathy  Freeman  ran  a  victory  lap  after
winning the 400 metre race at the Sydney Olympics, she proudly  carried  the
Australian flag in her one hand and the Aboriginal flag in her  other  hand.
This epitomises a society with respect for heritage.

Ons het in Suid-Afrika 'n ryk, gedeelde  erfenis  -  die  land,  die  bodem,
sekere dinge wat eie geword het aan die totale  Suid-Afrikaanse  samelewing,
'n lotsgebondenheid aan dit wat ons aan ons kinders  nalaat.  Ons  moet  dit
uitbou en koester.

Maar ons het ook in Suid-Afrika 'n ryk verskeidenheid  in  ons  erfenis,  'n
verskeidenheid van tale, kulture en gebruike. Ek  wil  vandag  die  stelling
maak dat die sleutel tot die sukses van die  geheel  afhanklik  is  van  die
eerbied  en  respek  vir  die  dele.  Die  eenheid  van  die  leuse  op  die
landswapen, afhanklik van respek  vir  die  verskeidenheid  wat  ook  daarin
vervat is, die boustene vir 'n Suid-Afrika waarin al sy  kinders  veilig  en
geborge kan wees, lê nie in 40 miljoen individuele erfporsies nie,  maar  in
die eerbiedige ontvangs en oordrag van 'n tiental gedeelde erfgoed.

Die beskerming van hierdie erfenis mag nie in museums opgesluit  lê  om  nou
en dan deur besoekers bekyk te word nie. Nee, dit moet geleef word,  in  ons
harte, in ons strate, in  ons  alledaagse  leefwyse.  In  dié  opsig  is  ek
bevrees dat ons dikwels lippediens bewys aan die ryke kaleidoskoop  van  die
erfenis van al ons mense.

Die duidelikste voorbeeld hiervan  was  die  radio-advertensie  waarvan  die
bewoording gelui het dat Suid-Afrika  gekies  is  vir  die  konferensie  oor
rassisme omdat ons talle kulture, tale en gelowe dit reggekry  het  om  saam
te smelt tot een.  Nee,  kulture  en  gelowe  wat  moet  saamsmelt,  is  nie
transformasie nie, maar deformasie. Dit beteken juis  die  vernietiging  van
ons erfenis.

Daarom wil die  AEB  ook  sy  spyt  uitspreek  dat  die  jaarlikse  Cultural
Conference wat deur die Departement van Provinsiale  en  Plaaslike  Owerheid
gereël word nou al  vir  twee  jaar  nie  plaasgevind  het  nie.  Die  woord
``erfenis'',  en  erns  oor  die   erfenis,   staan   lynreg   teenoor   die
verbruikerskultuur wat gebruik om op te gebruik. Ons wil gebruik  om  na  te
laat. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In South Africa we have a rich, shared  heritage  -  the  land,  the  soil,
certain things that have become part of the whole of South African  society,
a common destiny that we leave to our children. We must build  on  this  and
cherish it.

But in South Africa we also  have  a  rich  diversity  in  our  heritage,  a
diversity of languages, cultures and customs. I want to make  the  statement
today that the key to the success of the whole depends on the  honouring  of
and respect for the parts. The unity of the slogan  on  our  coat  of  arms,
which is based on respect for the diversity contained in  it,  the  building
blocks of a South Africa in which all her children can be safe  and  secure,
does not lie in 40 million individual inheritances, but  in  the  respectful
receipt and transfer of a tenfold shared inheritance.

The protection of this heritage may not be locked up in museums only  to  be
looked at by visitors now and then. No, it must be lived, in our hearts,  in
our streets, in our everyday lives. In this  regard  I  am  afraid  that  we
often pay lip service to the rich kaleidoscope of the heritage  of  all  our
people.

The clearest example of this was the  radio  advertisement  that  said  that
South Africa was selected for the conference  on  racism  because  our  many
cultures, languages and faiths have  succeeded  in  merging  into  one.  No,
cultures and faiths that must merge into  one  is  not  transformation,  but
deformation. This in fact means the destruction of our heritage.
This is why the AEB also wishes  to  express  its  regret  that  the  annual
Cultural Conference, which is organised by the Department of Provincial  and
Local Government, has not taken place for  the  past  two  years.  The  word
``heritage'', and seriousness concerning heritage, is diametrically  opposed
to the consumer culture that utilises  in  order  to  use  up.  We  want  to
utilise in such a way as to leave behind.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon member  might  like  to
know that in West Africa one finds ``cassies'' all over, not Cassie  Aucamp,
but ``cassie'' for cashier.

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: Chairperson, since the ANC assumed power  in  1994,
it has embarked on the road to a transformed society. As a  party,  the  ANC
sought to transform South Africa  from  a  racist  and  divided  past  to  a
nonracial democracy. As we today consider the various  symbols  representing
the heritage of our nation, there is indeed a recognition  of  the  heritage
of diverse cultural groups in our  country,  as  well  as  the  heritage  of
single nationhood which has emerged as one  of  the  hallmarks  of  the  new
South Africa under ANC rule.

The miracle of postapartheid South  Africa  is  that  our  national  symbols
reflect both the diversity and the unity of our  transformed  South  African
society. We have a national anthem which symbolises the coming  together  of
languages, traditions and the histories of our past. The coat of arms,  with
its motto in Khoi, !ke e:  /xarra  //ke,  which  literally  means  ``diverse
people unite'', reminds us that this land is for all of us who live in it.

We have a language policy  in  which  all  indigenous  languages  have  been
declared official languages. We have a national flag which is a synopsis  of
the principal colours of South Africa's  flag  history,  spanning  from  the
earliest time  to  the  present.  Our  Constitution  guarantees  freedom  of
worship  and  the  official  policy  of  the  ANC  Government  is   one   of
noninterference in religious practices.

We have different statues and memorials throughout the  length  and  breadth
our country, from Robben Island as  a  national  monument  standing  at  the
southernmost tip of Africa, to the Voortrekker Monument in the north of  our
country, from the statue of Paul Kruger on Church  Square  in  Pretoria,  to
the monument in memory of King Shaka in KwaZulu-Natal.

This is our diverse though united heritage as a South  African  nation.  And
what greater tribute has ever been paid to our unity as a  nation  than  the
awe-inspiring address by President Thabo Mbeki when he proclaimed ``I am  an
African''? In his description of an African, he included every single  South
African, however diverse the cultural roots and historical  origin  of  that
South African may be.

Ek wil vandag bietjie teruggaan in die  kultuurgeskiedenis  om  die  erfenis
van ons verenigde nasie te bepeins.

Ek wil vir die Huis en die nasie vandag die storie vertel van 'n  Khoi-vrou.
Haar naam was Eva en sy het in die 1670s in die huis van  Jan  van  Riebeeck
grootgeword het. Eva was 'n kleinniggie van Harry die  Strandloper.  Sy  was
'n mooi en intelligente vrou, en het gou vlot Hollands leer  praat,  en  kon
ook skaflik in Portugees kommunikeer. Jan van  Riebeeck  het  haar  as  tolk
gebruik,  maar  het  haar  ook  aan  'n  Westerse  lewenstyl  in   sy   huis
blootgestel. Sy het geleer om Westerse disse  voor  te  berei.  Sy  het  die
moderne Westerse klerestyl begin dra, en  het  ook  die  Christelike  geloof
aangeneem. Sy is derhalwe ook as enkele Khoi-lidmaat van die Groote Kerk  in
Kaapstad bevestig. Sy het uiteindelik getrou met ene Pieter van Meerhof,  'n
ontdekkingsreisiger uit Denemarke.

Na 'n paar jaar het die noodlot Eva oorval. Haar man is op brutale  wyse  in
Madagaskar  vermoor,  en  haar  mentor,  Van  Riebeeck,   het   na   Holland
teruggekeer. Eva het nou 'n swerwersbestaan begin voer,  en  geswerf  tussen
die inheemse Khoi-gemeenskappe en die Hollandse koloniste aan die  Kaap.  Sy
het uiteindelik in  drank  en  wellus  verval,  en  is  deur  die  Hollandse
Kompanjie na Robbeneiland verban, waar sy ook uiteindelik gesterf het.

'n  Mens  kan  seker  baie  lesse  neem  uit  die  kleurryke  dog   tragiese
geskiedenis van Eva. Eva het wel die  geleentheid  gesmaak  om  in  'n  huis
volgens die kultuur en waardestelsels van die Hollandse Kommandeur, Jan  van
Riebeeck,  op  te  groei.  Sy  het  egter  stelselmatig  van  haar   wortels
-``roots'' - in die Khoi-gemeenskap losgeraak, en 'n Westerse leefwyse  saam
met haar man en hoë vriende in die  Kompanjie  begin  lei.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Today I would like to go  back  in  our  cultural  history  to  ponder  the
heritage of our united nation.

Today I want to tell the House and the nation the story  of  a  Khoi  woman.
Her name was Eva and she grew up in Jan van Riebeeck's house in  the  1670s.
Eva was a second cousin of Harry the Strandloper. She was an attractive  and
intelligent woman, and soon learned to speak Dutch fluently, and could  also
communicate adequately in Portuguese.  Jan  van  Riebeeck  used  her  as  an
interpreter, but also exposed her to a Western lifestyle in  his  home.  She
learned to  prepare  Western  dishes.  She  began  to  wear  modern  Western
clothing, and also adopted the Christian faith. In addition,  she  was  also
confirmed as the sole Khoi member of the  Groote  Kerk  in  Cape  Town.  She
eventually married one Pieter van Meerhof, an explorer from Denmark.

After a few years, fate overtook Eva. Her husband was brutally  murdered  in
Madagascar, and her mentor, Van Riebeeck, returned to Holland. Eva now  took
on a nomadic existence, and wandered among the indigenous  Khoi  communities
and the Dutch colonists in the Cape. She eventually  fell  into  a  life  of
alcohol and wantonness, and  was  exiled  to  Robben  Island  by  the  Dutch
Company, where she also eventually died.

One can probably learn many lessons from the colourful  yet  tragic  history
of Eva. Eva had the opportunity to grow up  in  a  house  according  to  the
culture and  value  systems  of  the  Dutch  Commander,  Jan  van  Riebeeck.
However,  she  systematically  moved  away  from  her  roots  in  the   Khoi
community, and began leading  a  Western  lifestyle  with  her  husband  and
illustrious friends in the Company.]

There is probably nothing wrong  with  cross-cultural  pollination.  But  if
only certain selected individuals are being assimilated into a new  culture,
there will eventually arise a clash of interests  between  the  old  culture
and the new one. It has therefore been of  the  utmost  importance  that  we
create an open, nonracial society, with mutual understanding of and  respect
for different cultures so that  by  means  of  freedom  of  association  our
people can integrate and relate constructively to one another as equals  and
as fellow countrymen and women.

I now want to turn to the initiatives  that  have  been  undertaken  in  the
educational field in celebrating  our  national  symbols,  as  part  of  the
Values in Education Initiative. The Constitution of the  Republic  of  South
Africa clearly expresses South Africa's social values and  its  expectations
of the roles, rights and responsibilities of citizens in a democratic  South
Africa.
It is a pity that the  hon  Sydney  Opperman  spoke  about  new  values  and
principles as if these values are not enshrined  in  our  Constitution.  His
utterings were those of a person who sits in the House blindfolded. That  is
probably why Comrade Hangana responded  metaphorically  to  his  provocative
speech.

Our new curriculum, Curriculum 2005, is premised on the goals and values  of
the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. The challenge for the  new
curriculum is how the  goals  and  values  of  social  justice,  equity  and
democracy can be infused across the curriculum.

The promotion of values is important, not only  for  the  sake  of  personal
development, but also to ensure that a national, South African  identity  is
built on  values  very  different  from  those  that  underpinned  apartheid
education.  The  kind  of  learner  that  is  envisaged  is  one  who  will,
accordingly, be imbued with the  values  and  act  in  the  interests  of  a
society based on respect for democracy, equality, human  dignity,  life  and
social justice. This is the kind  of  citizen  that  should  emerge  from  a
school system in a democratic society.

In the area of social sciences, history and geography,  the  new  curriculum
aims to develop informed, critical and responsible citizens who are able  to
participate constructively in a culturally diverse and changing society.  In
a multilingual country like South Africa,  it  is  important  that  learners
reach high levels of proficiency in at least two  languages  and  that  they
are  able  to  communicate  in  other  languages.  However,  learners'  home
languages will be used for the purposes of learning  and  teaching  wherever
possible.

I would like to conclude with the following  words  which  flowed  from  our
President in his ``I am an African'' speech:


  Our Constitution rejoices in the diversity of our people and creates  the
  space for all of us, voluntarily, to define ourselves as one people.

With those words, I want to express the hope  that  our  2001  Heritage  Day
celebrations  will  again  provide  us  with  the  opportunity  of  defining
ourselves as one people out of our diverse cultures. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, I trust that you and  all
of South Africa will find fulfilment on Heritage Day.

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 17:37.
