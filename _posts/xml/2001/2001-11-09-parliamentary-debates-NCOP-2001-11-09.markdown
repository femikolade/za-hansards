The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I thought for a moment, Mr Durr, that you  were
joining everyone else in crossing the floor. [Laughter.]

Does any member wish to move a motion without notice?

Mr C ACKERMANN: It is Friday.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mr Ackermann  wishes  to  move  a  motion  that
today is Friday. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]  Is  there  any  objection  to
that motion? [Laughter.]

                     PLIGHT OF CIVILIANS IN AFGHANISTAN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr V V Z WINDVOÉL: Chairperson, I would like to move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the plight of  civilians  in  Afghanistan  and  the  inadequate
       response thereto by the international community;


  (2) further notes reported incidents  in  which  innocent  citizens  have
       become war casualties in Afghanistan;


  (3) believes that any further onslaught on terrorism should  be  measured
       and not incur any loss of innocent lives; and


  (4) therefore calls upon the international community to be circumspect in
       its fight against terrorism.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     GOOD WISHES FOR DIWALI AND RAMADAAN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -

       celebration of the festival of lights; and


  (2) wishes all Muslim South Africans well during  the  fasting  month  of
       Ramadaan.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                   IMPOSITION OF LIFE SENTENCES FOR MURDER
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes and appreciates that yesterday Judge Griesel  sentenced  Messrs
       Jones and Albertyn to life imprisonment after finding them guilty  of
       murdering Younis and Fazlin Hassen at  their  home  in  October  last
       year;


  (2) further notes that this is another indication within a week that  the
       Government is  serious  about  addressing  violent  crime  and  urban
       terror; and


  (3) congratulates the National Director of Public  Prosecutions  for  the
       relentless work done in bringing all perpetrators to book.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 OCCUPATION OF OPPENHEIMER LAND IN ZIMBABWE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that it is reported that three properties of  approximately  35
       000 hectares belonging to the South African Oppenheimer  family  have
       been claimed by the Zimbabwean government and occupied  by  illegals,
       with threats to claim further  large  tracts  of  farmland  from  the
       family; and


  (2) requests the  South  African  Government  to  intervene  and  to  act
       speedily and effectively to protect the  interests  and  property  of
       South African citizens  and  companies  in  Zimbabwe,  including  the
       Oppenheimer family, from the actions of the state.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to  that  motion?  There
is an objection. The motion will therefore become notice of a motion.
                      AGRICULTURAL DEBT MANAGEMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Rev P MOATSHE: Hon Chairperson, hon  Deputy  Minister  for  Agriculture  and
Land Affairs and hon members of this  House,  according  to  the  employment
trends in agriculture published by Statistics SA, the level of farming  debt
outstanding rose  significantly  during  the  period  1988-1996  from  R10,5
billion in 1988 to R18,5 billion in 1996.

Although commercial banks were  the  largest  creditors  of  the  commercial
farming  sector,  the  Government's  outstanding  debt  accounted  for  R435
million. Much of this  outstanding  debt  was  made  available  through  the
Agricultural Credit Board constituted in terms of  the  Agricultural  Credit
Act of  1966,  which  has  historically  served  a  political  and  economic
function by providing financial  assistance  for  white  commercial  farmers
only.

The  credit  delivery  function  of  the  Agricultural  Credit   Board   was
subsequently taken  away,  pursuant  to  a  recommendation  by  the  Strauss
Commission into the Provision of Rural Financial Services through  the  Land
Bank Amendment Act of 1998.

However, the Agricultural Credit Act was and still is financial  assistance-
based and not aligned  with  the  Constitution  and  the  Public  Management
Finance Act. The need was therefore felt for new legislation which would  be
aligned with the Constitution and the Public Management Finance  Act,  would
establish a new debt recovery framework and would allow for the  utilisation
of funds in the  Agricultural  Debt  Account  for  agricultural  development
programmes through the budgetary process of Parliament.

What is the Agricultural Debt Account, and how  will  the  money  in  it  be
utilised? The Agricultural Credit Account, in terms of section 20(a) of  the
Agricultural  Credit  Act,  continues  to  exist  under  a  new  name.   The
Agricultural Debt Account consists  of  moneys  received  as  repayment  for
debts.

This account will cease to exist only when all outstanding debts  have  been
collected  or  written  off,  and  the  moneys  have  been  appropriated  by
Parliament for agricultural development programmes.

Funds can be utilised for agricultural development programmes only in  terms
of business  plans  approved  by  the  Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs. The director-general may request  the  transfer  of  money  in  the
account to the national revenue  fund  in  order  to  finance  the  approved
business plans. However, the Minister for Agriculture and Land  Affairs,  in
consultation with the Minister of  Finance,  must  approve  such  transfers.
Parliament would then appropriate such money on the vote of  the  Department
of Agriculture and Land Affairs for the specific financial year.

In summary, the proposed Agricultural Debt  Management  Bill  thus  provides
for the continuation and administration of the Agricultural Credit  Account,
although under a new name. The Bill further provides  for  the  use  of  the
account  as  a  mechanism  for  managing  agricultural  debt  payments,  the
administration of moneys in the account and the utilisation of funds in  the
account to finance future agricultural development.

Motswana a re molato ga o bole, molato o jelwa mpeng [The  Batswana  have  a
saying to the effect that a debt is never forgotten].
Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                     LAND AFFAIRS GENERAL AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Rev M CHABAKU: Madam Chairperson, the amendments contained in this Bill  are
of  a  technical  nature  and,  therefore,  seek   to   streamline   current
legislation in this area.

I understand that the department consulted widely on this  Bill,  especially
with regard to concerns that legislation passed by this Parliament  was  not
accomplishing what it set out to do.

This Bill seeks to  streamline  the  two  pertinent  pieces  of  legislation
affected, namely the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act and the  Extension  of
Security of Tenure Act. At the same time, the department is also looking  at
examining the implementation of  the  legislation  already  passed,  and  is
looking  into  correcting  some  of  the  hiccups   that   occurred   during
implementation. We will be monitoring  the  process  very  closely  for  any
further problems.

The proposed amendments to the Land Reform  (Labour  Tenants)  Act  of  1996
cover the loopholes in the principal Act, where a ``tenant''  was  described
but ``associates'' ignored.

The omission resulted in a number of difficulties, especially  where  family
members were not allowed to even apply for their  rights.  Associates  would
therefore now consist of family members of a tenant and others nominated.

Another significant amendment to  section  9  of  the  Land  Reform  (Labour
Tenants) Act involves the age at which a labour tenant who refuses or  fails
to provide  labour  to  an  owner  or  lessee  can  be  evicted.  There  was
inconsistency in the legislation, with the Land Reform (Labour Tenants)  Act
putting the limit at 66 years, and the the Extension of Security  of  Tenure
Act putting the age limit at 60.

So the Bill will amend the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act to make the  age
limit only 60 years instead of 65. A person over 60 years of age  cannot  be
evicted if the person can no longer perform work.
The most important amendment is to section 15 of  the  Land  Reform  (Labour
Tenants) Act, which involves owners seeking to evict tenants. The  amendment
makes provision to protect evictees in  cases  where  eviction  orders  were
turned down by the courts.  The  amendment  therefore  ensures  that  proper
arrangements are to be made to reinstate those evicted.

The Extension of Security of Tenure Act of 1997 will be  amended  to  ensure
that owners who routinely gave permission to bury do not  use  the  omission
of that right from the Act to take that right away from their  tenants.  The
definition of ``established practice'' in the Bill will  make  the  practice
of burials in its current form legally binding.

This Bill allows tenants to bury deceased family  members  who  were  living
with them at the time  of  death  and  also  allows  family  members  of  an
occupier according to section  8(4)  -  a  long-term  occupant,  a  disabled
occupant or someone over the age of 60 - to bury the occupier  on  the  land
on which he or she was residing  at  the  time  of  death,  subject  to  any
reasonable conditions which are not more complex and  difficult  than  those
prescribed and that may be imposed by the owner or person in charge.

I believe that the department, with this Bill, will help  to  reconcile  the
ongoing difficulties experienced between the landowner and the  tenant.  The
committee therefore endorses this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

                          LOTTERIES AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Order disposed of without debate.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                   RSA/EGYPT POLICE CO-OPERATION AGREEMENT

                                (Discussion)

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, I rise this morning to make a  statement  on  the
agreement between the Government of the Republic of  South  Africa  and  the
government of the Arab Republic of Egypt in respect of police  co-operation.
The agreement was signed on 20 July 2000, during the fourth session  of  the
bilateral commission between South Africa and Egypt held in Pretoria.

In essence this agreement provides for co-operation in  the  prevention  and
investigation of crime between  the  SA  Police  Service  and  the  Egyptian
Ministry of the Interior.  It  furthermore  provides  for  the  exchange  of
expertise and information as well as co-operation  in  personnel  management
and training. That is basically the essence of this agreement between  South
Africa and Egypt.

I think I must also make two points in respect  of  this  agreement.  Whilst
we, as a country, have appreciation for the transformation  that  has  taken
place within our Police Service, we must equally acknowledge that  a  number
of problems still exist  which  impact  on  the  ability  of  Government  to
provide South Africans with a safe and secure environment.

One of these problems, obviously, is the low  level  of  trust  between  the
police and communities in our country. This lack of trust is  basically  the
result of  the  historical  role  the  police  played  in  suppressing  mass
opposition to the apartheid system in  this  country.  Such  information  is
well  documented.  This  lack  of  trust  manifests  itself  mostly  in  the
unwillingness of communities to co-operate  with  the  police  in  combating
crime.

We must also mention that winning the  trust  of  communities  is  the  most
effective weapon in the fight against crime, and it is in this  regard  that
our police can learn from foreign  police  services  that  have  established
close co-operation and trust with the communities they serve.

I think the agreement would assist South Africa in  the  field  of  criminal
investigations because we have so  much  to  gain  from  countries  such  as
Egypt. We also  know  that  criminal  investigation  was  a  relatively  new
concept in our  Police  Service  before  and  immediately  after  1994.  And
precisely because of this kind of agreement, I think  we  will  be  able  to
draw, as a country, extremely important lessons which would then  strengthen
the Government's hand in the fight against crime.
I think this agreement will definitely benefit our Police Service  and  will
further cement the kind of  ties  that  exist  between  a  democratic  South
Africa and Egypt. I think it is absolutely desirable,  therefore,  that  the
entire House supports this agreement [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                  RSA/NIGERIA POLICE CO-OPERATION AGREEMENT

                                (Discussion)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I see,  Kgoshi  Mokoena,  that  you  have  been
teaching Mrs Versfeld some Setswana! [Laughter.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, this agreement, in respect  of  police  co-
operation, desires to improve the effectiveness of the  SA  Police  Service,
as well as the  Nigerian  police,  in  the  investigation,  prosecution  and
suppression of crime. This agreement was  signed  on  14  March  this  year,
during the third session of the South Africa-Nigeria  binational  commission
held in Abuja in Nigeria.

In essence, the agreement lays a foundation for joint operation by both  the
South African police and the police of the federal Republic of Nigeria.

The agreement also provides for the exchange of expertise  and  information,
as  well  as  co-operation  in  personnel  management  and  training.   This
agreement does not require ratification or accession. It is an agreement  in
terms of section 231(3) of the Constitution of South Africa, which  requires
that the agreement be tabled in  the  National  Assembly  and  the  National
Council of Provinces.

The areas of  co-operation  between  the  two  countries  will  include  the
exchange of crime-related information on a  regular  basis,  the  controlled
delivery  of  illegal  substances  or  any  other  objects,  and   technical
assistance and expertise where this is required; and the provisions of  this
agreement shall not apply to any offence or  investigation  of  a  political
nature.

This agreement will enhance the exchange of expertise  and  information,  as
well as co-operation in personnel management  and  training.  It  will  also
promote ties that already exist between the Federal Republic of Nigeria  and
the Republic of South Africa.

The agreement also requires  that  between  the  two  of  them,  the  police
services of both South Africa and Nigeria shall, if so requested in  writing
by the police service of another  country,  render  all  reasonable  advice,
support or assistance relating to  the  training  of  their  officials,  the
improvement or development of their organisation or  administration  or  the
promotion of their expertise with regard to the performance of the  policing
function to enhance co-operation between the two countries.

On behalf of my country, I table this agreement for adoption. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST AND ABUSE OF CHILDREN

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mevrou die Voorsitter, ek het  hierdie  debat  aangevra
omdat ek  van  die  Noord-Kaap  kom  en  omdat  Louisvale  in  my  politieke
verantwoordelikheidsgebied is; omdat die Benede-Oranjerivier die  streek  is
wat beskou word as die mekka van verkragting, waar daar  per  100 000  mense
meer verkragtings plaasvind as in enige ander plek in die  land  en  in  die
wêreld.

Dit is ook hier waar daar 'n bietjie meer as 'n week  gelede  'n  negejarige
kind verkrag is deur ses mans. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is vir my baie sleg  om
hieroor te praat, want as ek hieroor praat, kan ek nie anders nie as om  ook
te praat as 'n pa, 'n pa wat drie pragtige dogters het. Wanneer  ek  hieroor
praat, kan ek ook nie anders nie as om hulle onskuldige ogies  te  sien  toe
hulle ook nege jaar oud was.

AGB LEDE: Nege maande!

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Verskoning, toe hulle nege máánde oud was.

Ek wil hê elke agb lid moet ook net dink aan  sy  of  haar  eie  kinders  of
kleinkinders toe hulle  daardie  ouderdom  was.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Madam Chair, I have requested  this  debate  because  I
come from the Northern Cape and because Louisvale falls within my  political
jurisdiction; because the Lower Orange River is the region that is  regarded
as the Mecca of rape, where more rapes occur per 100 000 people than in  any
other place in this country and in the world.

It is also here that a nine-year-old child was raped by  six  men  a  little
more than a week ago. [Interjections.] It is very bad for me to  talk  about
this, because when I talk about this, I cannot but also speak as  a  father,
a father who has three beautiful daughters. When I talk about this,  I  also
cannot help seeing their innocent eyes when they too were nine years old.

HON MEMBERS: Nine months!

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: I beg your pardon, when they were nine months old.

I would like every hon member to  think  of  his  or  her  own  children  or
grandchildren when they were that age.]

Can the House imagine six adult men penetrating  that  innocent  nine-month-
old baby's body? I just cannot imagine it. The shocking aspect is that  this
is not an exceptional case. During the same week a three-year-old  girl  and
her mother were admitted to the Kimberley Hospital, both sexually abused.

In two incidents in the Free State a  one-year-old  boy  from  Meloding  was
sexually abused.

Op Tweeling is twee mans van 34 jaar en  37  jaar  oud  in  hegtenis  geneem
nadat daar bloed aan die boudjies van 'n 14  maande  oue  dogtertjie  gevind
is. Daar is duisende sulke kinders wat nie die koerante  haal  nie.  Verlede
jaar is meer as 65 000  sake  by  die  Polisie  se  kinderbeskermingseenheid
aangemeld. Slegs 25 000 het die hof gehaal en slegs 7 000 is gevonnis.

Dit is onaanvaarbaar. Daar is talle kinders wat gevonnis word,  en  nie  die
kriminele nie. Kinders word hierdeur fisiek, emosioneel  en  met  geestelike
letsels gevonnis, en baie van hulle kry ook die doodvonnis in die  vorm  van
HIV/vigs.

In 85% van die gevalle is die oortreders bekend aan die kind;  45%  van  die
oortreders is die biologiese ouers en 8% is stiefouers.  'n  Mens  kan  baie
maklik vra of daar dan mense in ons gemeenskap  is  wat  soos  diere  geword
het. Ek is bevrees dit is nog  erger,  want  diere  gaan  net  oor  tot  die
seksdaad as die vroulike dier op hitte is. Hierso maak  dit  nie  eens  saak
nie. Dit is abnormaal en onaanvaarbaar en dit mag  nie  langer  geduld  word
nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In Tweeling two men aged 34 years and 37 years were  arrested  after  blood
was found on the buttocks of a 14-month-old girl.  There  are  thousands  of
children like this who do not make the newspapers. Last year  more  than  65
000 cases were reported to the Police child protection  unit.  Only  25  000
cases managed to reach court and only 7 000 perpetrators were sentenced.

This is unacceptable. There are many children who are being  sentenced,  and
not the criminals. Through this children  are  being  sentenced  physically,
emotionally and to mental scars, and many of them  also  receive  the  death
sentence in the form of HIV/Aids.

In 85% of the cases the perpetrators are known to  the  child;  45%  of  the
perpetrators are the biological parents and 8%  are  step-parents.  One  can
easily ask whether there are people in our community that have  become  like
animals. I am afraid it is  even  worse  than  that,  because  animals  only
commit the sexual act when the female animal is in heat. Here  it  does  not
even matter. This is abnormal and unacceptable  and  it  may  no  longer  be
tolerated.]

The National Council on Child Abuse and  Family  Violence  says  that  child
abuse includes four major categories,  ie  physical,  sexual  and  emotional
abuse, and neglect. What are we talking about  when  we  talk  about  sexual
abuse, and what is the impact on the child?

Sexual abuse  can  be  physical,  including  genital  or  oral  stimulation,
fondling and intercourse; nonphysical, including indecent exposure,  obscene
phone calls or peeping toms; and/or violent, as in rape or  other  forms  of
violent sexual behaviour.

Incidents of child sexual abuse are damaging whether they occur  only  once,
are repeated many times or last over a number of years. A  single  seemingly
minor   incident   may   cause   temporary   emotional   disturbances   like
embarrassment, fear, confusion, guilt, anxiety and a distrust of  adults  or
strangers.

Those who sexually victimise children often  suffer  from  an  emotional  or
psychological dysfunction, usually as a result of their own previous  sexual
victimisation.  This  becomes  a  vicious  circle.  The  majority  of  child
molesters are men who abuse both boys and  girls.  Women  make  up  a  small
percentage of those who sexually abuse children.

South Africa is committed by its Constitution and  international  agreements
it has ratified to protecting its children from abuse, but current  practice
and Government budget do not reflect this commitment. That was said  by  the
South African Human Rights Commission when they heard  evidence  in  October
this year during an inquiry in Gauteng.

During that inquiry, it was  further  stated  that  the  legal  system,  the
Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, medical  professionals
and the Police were failing  to  deliver  basic  human  rights  to  sexually
abused children.

Most state prosecutors and magistrates  were  not  sensitive  to  children's
psychological states and this affected the  outcome  of  cases,  the  social
workers said. The court process very often adds to the child's trauma.

Cases were frequently postponed repeatedly and  lasted  on  average  two  to
three years. Medical professionals were failing sexually abused children  in
that they were reluctant  to  report  seeing  evidence  of  abuse  on  child
patients as they, by  and  large,  wanted  to  avoid  becoming  involved  as
witnesses in court cases.

The social workers' submissions  unanimously  recommended  that  specialised
sexual  offences  courts  be  set  up  and  run  by  legal  personnel   with
specialised training in this field.

Another glaring shortcoming was that  there  was  only  one  black  forensic
social worker in the police and the language  barrier  prevented  the  other
seven from being involved in the cases of abuse  involving  black  children,
as too much information is lost in translation.

In the province or town where I come from, we have  a  group  of  women  who
organised themselves and formed a civil organisation, an NGO,  called  Women
against Rape.

Hulle het besluit dit sal nie verder gaan nie. Wanneer iemand verkrag  word,
gaan hulle na die huis toe, haal  die  verkragter  uit,  bring  hom  na  die
polisie en betoog by die hof dat geen borgtog toegestaan word nie.

Dit is tyd dat ons as gemeenskap ook bymekaar moet kom en  iets  moet  doen.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[They decided that it would go no further. When someone is  raped,  they  go
to the house, collect the rapist, bring him to the  police  and  protest  at
court that no bail be granted.

It is time that we, as a community, also came together and did something.]

When he launched the Nelson Mandela Children's  Fund  in  1995,  our  former
President said:


  There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul  than  the  way  in
  which it treats its children. As  we  set  about  building  a  new  South
  Africa, one of our highest priorities must therefore be our children. The
  vision of a new society that guides us should already be manifest in  the
  steps we take to address the wrong done to our youth and to  prepare  for
  their future. Our actions and policies, and the institutions  we  create,
  should be eloquent with care, respect and love.

And now, six years later, we have the challenge and the obligation  to  stop
this most violent, barbaric and heartless national crisis that we  face.  We
must put the words of Madiba into action, and we must do it now.  If  we  do
not, then we are not worth being here representing those  little  ones  whom
God entrusted to us. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, the recent brutal rape of a  nine-month-old
baby in the Northern Cape has again pushed the problem  of  sexual  violence
against and abuse of children to the top of our national agenda.

The brutality of this act on a defenceless baby by  grown-up  men  had  many
people in tears, because of the pain and suffering this  little  child  must
have endured. The perpetrators of such an act represent everything  that  is
not civilised. They do not qualify to be called human, yet  they  are  human
and they are part of our society. They are  the  fathers,  brothers,  uncles
and grandfathers of young children.

In an area called Kildare a school principal called  a  13-year-old  to  his
office. When this girl entered the principal's office,  he  asked  the  poor
girl to take off her clothes. When the girl refused,  he  pinned  her  down,
and the rest is history.

In an area called Vuwani a 50-year-old man  sexually  abused  his  daughter.
When he was confronted, he said he did that because he had been drunk.

In an area called Sekgakgapeng a 46-year-old pastor  who  claimed  he  could
assist people possessed by demons took a 14-year-old girl to the  mountains.
The aim of taking her there was to pray for her in order to  enable  her  to
sleep. But instead of praying for her, the unthinkable happened.

At Mashishimale village a  70-year-old  man  asked  a  12-year-old  girl  to
assist him in cleaning  his  bedroom.  Before  the  girl  could  even  start
cleaning, the old man went inside the room and locked the door. He told  the
girl that he wanted to teach her something very special which the  girl  had
been missing for a very long time. When the  girl  resisted,  this  old  man
forced himself on her. Do not ask me what happened, because it is obvious.

In Khutsong, near Carletonville, a  32-year-old  man  raped  a  six-year-old
girl. The girl had just been dropped at her parents' gate from a  preschool,
and the man called her to come and get some sweets. Instead of  sweets,  the
unbearable happened. In the same area in Carletonville, an 11-year-old  girl
was raped by her mother's boyfriend over a period of five days  in  October.
When the girl reported this to the mother, the mother chased the girl  away.
What a shame!

Society is sick, and something must be done.  These  rapists  are  the  ones
whom children look up to for trust, comfort and  protection,  yet  they  are
the ones who betray this  trust,  and  they  are  the  ones  who  cause  our
children discomfort, pain and suffering. These little  kids  are  no  longer
free even to walk in their own family home. The  question  we  need  to  ask
ourselves is: How can we ensure that our children grow up in an  environment
that is safe, free from the threat of sexual violence and  abuse,  and  free
from sexual deviance such as that which was committed by monsters who  raped
a defenceless baby?

Unfortunately, there is no single correct answer  to  these  questions.  The
answer lies in the adoption of a multifaceted  approach  that  includes  the
intensification of the education campaign around  sexual  violence  and  the
abuse of children, the eradication of poverty and alcohol abuse, the  social
upliftment  of  communities,  and  the  introduction  of  legislation  which
protects children. More importantly, this problem requires  the  restoration
of the moral fibre of our society.

Fighting sexual violence against and the abuse  of  children  is  everyone's
responsibility. Moreover, it is the responsibility of  men  because  by  and
large men are the  main  perpetrators  of  this  kind  of  abuse.  It  needs
conscious efforts from all sectors of society - Government, NGOs,  religious
and civic organisations, traditional leaders and  healers  and  all  of  us.
Most importantly, it needs the perpetrators themselves to  acknowledge  that
there is something wrong with them and that they need help to correct  their
deviant behaviour. If it comes to a push, something will happen.

At the level of Government,  a  lot  has  already  been  done  in  terms  of
legislation to protect our children. In fact, many of  the  laws  that  have
been passed since 1994  were  designed  to  protect  and  empower  the  most
vulnerable sectors of our society, namely children, women and the disabled.

In  terms  of  its  national  crime  prevention  strategy,  Government   has
identified sexual violence against and abuse of children as one of the  main
priorities. Therefore, it is not as if Government has not done anything.  It
has made a number of changes to our Criminal Procedure Act and the  Criminal
Law Amendment Act. These changes  have  been  aimed,  specifically,  at  the
refusal of bail and an imposition of minimum sentences  for  +sexual  crimes
committed against children. On a number of occasions these  laws  have  been
used to prevent the release on bail of child rapists. A  significant  number
of such perpetrators have been sentenced to life imprisonment.

We would like to congratulate those judges and magistrates who imposed  high
sentences and showed no mercy to these monsters. In terms of  the  treatment
of child victims of sexual violence and abuse, approximately 20  specialised
courts have been established which dedicate their efforts,  exclusively,  to
matters of rape and other sexual offences.

I would like to call upon all people who respect themselves  to  assist  the
Government in fighting this carnage. Gone are the days  when,  if  a  little
girl met a man, she would  run  to  him  with  a  smile  for  protection  or
comfort. These days when a little girl meets  a  man  she  will  change  her
direction or  look  for  the  nearest  hide-out.  This  must  be  condemned.
[Applause.]

Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, the  future  evaluation  of  human  society  will
always be measured by its treatment  of  the  vulnerable,  the  unprotected,
children, powerless groups, the aged and women of every description, and  by
its religions  and  ethics.  The  present  will  be  judged  by  its  policy
decisions and its expenditure priorities, despite  its  professed  religions
or legislated ethics.

Fundamentally, all human beings are capable of everything. The  Germans  who
killed  millions  are  our  blood  relations,  partners  in  trade  and  our
conceptual model for this House. The child soldiers of Sierra Leone are  our
blood  relations.  The  Hutus  and  the  Tutsis  are  each  other's  nearest
neighbours. During the worst periods of cruelty, we will still be  producing
magical art, wonderful music and soul-searching poetry. We are also part  of
that as creators or as audience. As little  as  we  can  separate  ourselves
from the perpetrators or victims of  such  heinous  deeds  as  the  rape  of
children, it is our response that will define us.

Evil does not ever disappear. It lies in wait, but it can be controlled  and
punished. However, that requires eternal vigilance and  expeditious  action.
And if we, who are sitting here, or any  of  us  outside  do  not  take  the
personal challenge, we will be written into history as much as  the  accused
who are now facing judgment in Upington.

Kom ons skets die scenario uit 'n ander hoek. Vra uself af  wat  sou  gebeur
het as ons 'n boksgeveg gereël het, of selfs net daar verby geloop  het,  of
miskien  die  saal  verhuur  het,  of  die  drank  verkoop   het,   of   die
toegangsreëls vir die onder agtiens so  ietwat  gebuig  het,  vir  'n  geveg
tussen 'n swaargewigbokser, aan die een kant, en 'n nege  maande  oue  baba,
aan die ander kant.

Vra jouself af wie die skuldiges is, al het niemand, behalwe die man in  die
kryt, die baba aangepak nie. Wat was die rol van die  skeidsregter?  Het  hy
bloot die reëls nagekom? Was hy die regter van die bokskryt wat  hom  geklee
het in die verweer van  die  neergelegte  reëls?  Vra  jouself  af,  as  die
omstanders gesê het dat hulle dronk was, sou dit  'n  verskoning  wees?  Vra
jouself af, as hierdie bokser voorheen in  sulke  gevegte  met  ander  babas
betrokke was, sou jy gesê het hy het sy straf uitgedien en  dat  hy  nog  'n
kans gegun moet word.

Vra jouself af of jy onskuldig  is  as  jy  jou  eie  kinders  naby  hierdie
bokskryt toelaat. Vra jouself af of jy hom sou geglo het as  die  bokser  of
enige een gesê het dat hy nie geweet het dat dit teen die wet was  nie.  Vra
jouself af of daar enige verskoning vir sulke gedrag kan wees. Die  antwoord
is 'n onomwonde: nee. Ek wil iets sê wat ek altyd aan my kinders sê  wanneer
hulle  met  verskonings  na  my  toe  kom:  Die  verlede  mag   jou   gedrag
verduidelik, maar dit kan dit nie verskoon nie.

Daarom wil ek ook  ondubbelsinnig  sê:  diesulkes  soos  die  Upington  Ses,
indien hul skuldig bevind word, moet  nooit  weer  'n  kans  gegun  word  om
deelnemers aan of bystaanders by die verkragting van 'n kind  te  wees  nie.
Die debat oor die doodstraf kry 'n nuwe dimensie in  hierdie  situasie.  Dit
gaan nie oor hoeveel geld dit gaan kos om gevangenes aan te hou nie. Dit  is
irrelevant. Dit gaan daaroor of die kans  bestaan  dat  die  verkragters  en
molesteerders, en indien die kwessie van HIV/Vigs daarby  betrek  word,  die
moordenaars, enigsins weer 'n geringe kans mag hê om nog 'n kind se lewe  te
verwoes. Die antwoord is vir my in elk geval duidelik, en die  antwoord  is:
nee.

Daar is sekere prioriteitsoptredes wat ons  moet  volg,  en  hierdie  stappe
verdien voorrang bo enige oorweging of evaluasie van wat die  skuldiges  aan
kinderverkragting, molestering, verwaarlosing, mishandeling of  wat  ook  al
daartoe gedryf het.  Ek  wil  geen  statistieke  opnoem  nie.  Ek  dink  ook
statistieke is irrelevant. Een insident is een te veel.

Hier is wat ons kan doen: diesulkes soos die Upington Ses  moet  nooit  weer
in 'n posisie geplaas word waar hulle hierdie  dade  kan  herhaal  nie.  Die
regstelsel moet doeltreffend funksioneer, en om dit  te  bewerkstellig  moet
fondse en personeel voorkeur kry. Gemeenskapsbetrokkenheid  op  alle  vlakke
moet die huidige patroon van ons onverwikkeldheid vervang. Kerke  en  morele
leiers moet aktiewe leiding gee. Tienerswangerskappe moet gestuit  word,  en
die gedrag wat daartoe lei moet onomwonde veroordeel word.  Veel  meer  klem
moet gelê word op die A van  die  ABC  van  die  Vigs  debat:  ``Abstinence,
Abstain''. Dit is geensins onmoontlik nie. Dit verg net selfdissipline.

Vryheid van spraak kan nie beteken dat volwassenes of kinders in  die  media
slagoffers word van  pedofiele  of  pornografie  nie.  Die  registrasie  van
seksoortreders, soos wat internasionaal nou gedoen  word,  moet  onmiddellik
ondersoek word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Let us sketch this scenario from  a  different  angle.  Ask  yourself  what
would have happened if we arranged a boxing match, or even just  passed  it,
or perhaps rented the hall, or sold the liquor, or bent the admission  rules
for the under eighteens, for a match between a  heavy-weight  boxer  on  the
one side, and a nine-month-old baby on the other side.
Ask yourself who are the guilty ones, although no one,  except  the  man  in
the ring, attacked the baby. What was  the  role  of  the  referee?  Did  he
merely comply with the rules? Was he the referee  of  the  boxing  ring  who
clothed himself in the defence of the laid-down rules?  Ask  yourself  this,
if the bystanders said that  they  were  drunk,  would  that  have  been  an
excuse? Ask yourself this, if this boxer had been  in  similar  fights  with
other babies before, would you have said that he had served  his  punishment
and that he should be granted another chance?

Ask yourself whether you would be innocent if you allow  your  own  children
to go hear this boxing ring. Ask yourself if you  would  have  believed  the
boxer or anyone who said that they did not know that this  was  against  the
law. Ask yourself whether there could be any excuse for such behaviour.  The
answer is an unequivocal: no. I want to say something which  I  always  tell
my children when they come with excuses to me: The past might  explain  your
behaviour, but it cannot excuse it.

Therefore I also want to unambiguously say: People like  the  Upington  Six,
if they are found guilty, should  never  again  be  given  a  chance  to  be
participants or bystanders at the rape of a  child.  The  debate  about  the
death penalty takes on a new dimension in this situation. The matter is  not
about how much money it will cost to detain prisoners. That  is  irrelevant.
The question is whether the chance exists that the  rapists  and  molesters,
and if the question of HIV/Aids should be  included,  the  murderers,  might
have a slight chance to destroy yet another child's life.  The  question  is
clear to me in any case, and the answer is: no.

There are certain priority actions which we should follow, and  these  steps
deserve preference above any consideration or evaluation of what  drove  the
perpetrators of child rape,  molestation,  neglect,  abuse  or  whatever  to
their deeds. I do not want to  quote  any  statistics.  I  also  think  that
statistics are irrelevant. One incident is one too many.

This is what we can do: People such as the Upington Six should  never  again
be placed in a position where they can repeat these deeds. The legal  system
should function effectively, and to effect this funds and  personnel  should
enjoy preference. Community involvement at all  levels  should  replace  our
current pattern of lack of involvement. Churches and  moral  leaders  should
take  an  active  lead.  Teenage  pregnancies  should  be  stopped  and  the
behaviour which leads to this should be condemned unequivocally.  Much  more
emphasis should be  placed  on  the  A  of  the  ABC  of  the  Aids  debate:
``Abstinence, Abstain''. It is by no means impossible. It only  needs  self-
discipline.

Freedom of speech cannot mean that adults or children in  the  media  become
victims of paedophiles or pornography. The registration  of  sex  offenders,
as is now being done internationally, should be investigated immediately.]

We, as lawmakers, must also review our  budget  priorities.  Our  priorities
and policies should not and cannot lie with  philosophies  and  abstractions
when dealing with these issues. The more vulnerable members of society  are,
the more they should be able to lay claim to our protection. This should  be
the basis of any legislation we pass. We must accept the inherent  costs  of
the society we profess to  desire.  Children  in  squatter  camps,  children
without care, children without food - all children  must  be  cherished  and
given priority.

How many of us have looked at the Budget and considered its impact on  women
and children before we looked at the other requirements?  As  lawmakers,  we
must also review our moral priorities. We supposedly do  not  have  time  in
our legislative programme to pass the  recommended  law  on  compulsory  HIV
testing for alleged sexual offenders although this was  put  before  Cabinet
in July. Nor in five years have we paid any real attention  to  the  private
member's Bill on a proposed fund for the victims of violent  crime.  Yet  we
make time and money available for changing the electoral laws.

I think, therefore, we have run out of excuses. When we debate this  subject
next year, let it be a list  of  our  achievements,  not  of  our  failures.
[Applause.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, there could be no other convenient time as  far
as I can see than this for our country to seriously consider the  employment
of  preventive  sentences  for  the  perpetrators  of   sexual   harassment,
particularly given the gravity of this problem today.

A punitive punishment measure  one  could  recommend  is  nothing  short  of
castrating the offenders, because this kind of punishment would  undoubtedly
ensure peace and health in the  minds  of  these  perpetrators.  This  is  a
disease, a psychological disease. Moreover, the  taxpayer's  money  will  be
saved because imprisonment and the care of such prisoners cost the  taxpayer
unbearable inconvenience.

One other proposal perhaps one could make is that  we  could  isolate  these
offenders, give them  their  own  location  and  let  them  stay  under  the
supervision of the police for the rest of their  lives.  But,  at  the  same
time, allow them to go to work and come home and still continue  to  support
their families. The bottom line is that we should really isolate  them  from
civic society.

The last recommendation perhaps one could make, once these people are  found
to be legally guilty, is to design a  label  and  force  them  to  wear  it,
behind and even in front of  them,  which  describes  their  behaviour.  One
perhaps could have inscription  that  could  read  as  follows:  This  is  a
confirmed sexual harasser and a rapist. They must live with this  particular
tag for the rest of their lives, and wherever they go. [Laughter.]

These are the few things I was just thinking, because what is happening  now
is definitely unbelievable. Nobody can really believe what is  happening  in
South Africa. Taking these people to court is going to cost a lot of  money,
and all that will happen is that they will go  to  prison,  stay  there  and
still enjoy the best privileges that even I do not think I will ever  enjoy.
[Applause.]

[Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, hon members, we  as  mothers  and  fathers  are
very heartbroken. We are afraid and we are in great agony all the time,  and
we are always looking over our shoulders  as  a  result  of  what  has  been
happening in our country. We heard about what happened to  a  nine-month-old
baby girl that was molested by some heartless men. We are not even going  to
call them men because they are animals.

In the olden days, when a child was born there was a celebration. But  these
days when a child is born, we are afraid, wondering whether she or  he  will
grow up well. While we nurture the child,  treating  her  like  a  beautiful
flower, someone evil might also be  looking  at  her  with  hunger  -  I  am
talking about a newborn baby - someone who is going to rape that child.]

The sexual abuse of girls in South African schools, documented in  a  report
released on 30 March this year by Human Rights Watch, should  be  cause  for
concern for the entire society. The report states that South  African  girls
continue to be raped, sexually abused, sexually harassed  and  assaulted  at
school by male classmates and teachers. For many, violence and abuse are  an
inevitable part of the school environment.

The Department of Education, as part of Government's commitment to  ensuring
that our children grow up with a family life, enjoying all  the  rights  and
privileges  they  deserve,  has  embarked  on   introducing   sexual   abuse
prevention in life-skills learning  through  analysing  different  kinds  of
relationships that exist between  the  sexes  and  also  through  evaluating
these  relationships.  Learners  are  enabled  to  reflect  on   their   own
behaviour, on that of others,  and  to  critically  evaluate  human  rights,
values and practices.

Despite  the  effort  we  made  in  this  House  on  1  June  this  year  on
International Children's Day by expressing our  anger  and  outrage  at  the
perpetrators of these heinous deeds against our children, our children  have
been and continue to be abused,  sexually  molested,  tortured,  mistreated,
neglected and abandoned by the very people they trust, the very people  they
rely on.

All day, every day, every hour,  men  and  boys  keep  touching  girls'  and
women's bums and breasts. The police  do  not  consider  this  behaviour  as
constituting offences. In doing so, these people destroy  the  innocence  of
our children and our women.

Formerly, in our  society,  children  were  treated  with  the  respect  and
dignity that every human being deserves. Our elders knew that if one  abused
one's children or let others abuse one's children,  the  children  would  be
subjected to violence and ignorance which destroy society. Again, I wish  to
take this opportunity to reiterate the Government's commitment  to  ensuring
that all children enjoy the rights and privileges they deserve.

On 1 June 1994 we committed ourselves to the UN Declaration  of  the  Rights
of the Child.  We  have  NGOs  that  are  working  hand  in  hand  with  the
Government, such as the National Network on  Violence  Against  Women  which
was formed in 1995. Its  key  roles  are  to  promote  awareness,  services,
community mobilisation, advocacy and public education to get  Government  to
take more responsibility for service provision.

One of the biggest challenges facing South Africa is the provision  of  care
for the large number of children infected with HIV/Aids. In 1996 almost  30%
of all children  admitted  to  the  wards  of  the  Chris  Hani  Baragwanath
Hospital in Soweto tested positive for HIV. In 1998 more than  half  of  the
admissions to the wards at King Edward VIII Hospital  in  Durban  were  HIV-
related. Some of the progressive traditional healers  have  sent  out  clear
messages to child rapists that  HIV/Aids  cannot  be  avoided  or  cured  by
having carnal relations with children who are virgins.

Section 28 of our Constitution  deals  with  the  rights  of  children.  All
children should be protected from child  labour  and  many  other  forms  of
economic  exploitation  which  endanger  a  child's  mental,   physical   or
psychological health and interfere with his or her  education  in  order  to
develop properly and enjoy childhood. All children  have  the  right  to  be
protected  from  prostitution  and  sexual  exploitation.  It  is  generally
accepted  that  violence  against  women  and  children  occurs  across  all
socioeconomic and racial groups and is both widespread and on  the  increase
in South Africa.

The Government has realised that the problem of sexual abuse of children  is
not a problem of individual pathology, but a  severe  social  disorder,  and
that  intervention  strategies  would  need  to  address  the   ideological,
sociopolitical and psychological factors involved. It is  evident  that  the
problem associated with paedophilia is common in  the  white  community.  In
the past few weeks South Africa has been alarmed by a  new  form  of  sexual
abuse of children by poor black communities  who  believe  that  having  sex
with a virgin child reduces the chances of contracting  HIV/AIDS,  which  is
not true.

Nami nginembono  lonjengewaBabe  Nyakane  wekutsi  lenye  indlela  yekucedza

[Tandla.] (Translation of Swati paragraph follows.)

[I share the view that was expressed by Mr Nyakane, that  one  of  the  ways
which we can use to eradicate this animal behaviour  is  to  castrate  these
rapists and remove the offending body parts, so that they should never  rape
anyone again, because they would have been neutered. This would be a  lesson
even  to  others  in  the  community.  I  strongly  support   Mr   Nyakane's
sentiments. After they had been castrated, they would be put in  a  secluded
place, so that even our great-grandchildren would be able to see that  these
people were a menace to our society. There would be no need  to  go  to  the
zoo, because we have been going to the zoo to see animals for  a  long  time
now, and therefore we already know what animals  look  like.  We  would  put
them in our zoos, and we would go there and look at them. [Applause.]]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson and hon members of  this  House,  never  before
has there been so much anger and  condemnation  of  the  scourge  of  sexual
violence, harassment and abuse of  children,  as  at  present.  However,  it
would appear that the more the condemnation, the more the scourge  continues
unabated. Some of the incidents that have been reported in  the  news  media
are the most horrible, to say the least. Kgoshi Mokoena has just read  us  a
catalogue of these incidents.

When one considers that human beings, in terms of their creation,  are  only
just below a little below angels, one wonders whether  there  is  still  any
trace of humanity - ubuntu or botho - left  in  the  perpetrators  of  these
ghastly deeds. Some learners who  have  been  subjected  to  these  violence
experiences, such as rape, end up leaving school entirely. Very often,  such
children are  exposed  to  unwanted  pregnancies  and  sexually  transmitted
diseases, the deadliest of which is HIV/Aids.

What exactly must we do to curb this  scourge?  Some  women's  organisations
are so angry that  they  are  even  recommending  the  castration  of  these
rapists in order to render them permanently harmless. I go along  with  this
recommendation ... [Laughter.] ... especially when one  takes  into  account
that there are so  many  free  agents  out  there  who  are  waiting  to  be
approached and who are ready to say yes to a proposal. [Interjections.]  Why
should we tamper with children? [Interjections.] I  hope  I  have  not  said
anything unparliamentary, Chairperson.

I  further  propose  that  we,  as  members  of  Parliament,  mobilise   our
constituencies and everybody else to condemn sexual violence  and  abuse  of
children on a continuous basis. I further recommend that heavy penalties  be
imposed by the judges on the perpetrators. [Applause.]

Mntw  B  Z  ZULU:   Sihlalo   ohloniphekileyo   namalungu   ahloniphekileyo,
ngokwesiko lethu lesintu, uma  izinto  sezonakele  kanjena  kuyaye  kusukume
abadala bathethe.

Isonto eledlule libe  ngelinefu  elimnyama  ngendlela  esibone  kudlwengulwa
ngayo izingane zethu ezincane kakhulu. Umuntu  uzibuza  umbuzo  othi:  Konje
konakelephi esintwini uma sesingasenamahloni okwenza izigameko ezinjena?

Ukudlwengulwa  kosana,  uTshepang,   ngabesilisa   abayisithupha   abagulayo
kushaqise umhlaba. Umuntu wesilisa ekhaya nguye ongumvikeli womndeni  wakhe,
wemfuyo yakhe kanti nguye  futhi  ongumvikeli  wezwe  lakubo.  Thina  madoda
aqotho emindenini yawo nasesizweni saseMzansi Afrika sizibuza umbuzo  owodwa
othi: Ngempela konakalephi kubadlwenguli?

Lesi sihluku  sabadlwenguli  abanonya  olwesabekayo  ngisifanisa  nezidladla
zebhubesi zigxavula inkonyane  yenyathi  ngenkathi  ibaleka  ilandela  unina
wayo, oyaye kuthi noma eseyibona liyithanqaza phansi  edlule  abaleke  ngoba
naye engenamandla okuyivikela. Namuhla  izingane  zethu  kanye  nabesifazane
bakithi abahloniphekileyo  baphila  impilo  enovalo  lokuthi  bazodlwengulwa
bengazelele futhi bathelelwe nangegciwane leNgculazi.
Ngokosikompilo lwethu olwamiswa nguMvelinqangi, umuntu  omdala  uyahlonishwa
kakhulu kangangokuthi uze athathwe njengedlozi emndenini wakhe.  Kepha  kulo
nyaka  sibona  umfana  oneminyaka  engamashumi  amabili   edlwengula   ugogo
oneminyaka  engaphezulu  kwamashumi   ayisishiyagalolunye.   Umuntu   omdala
ubehlonishwa kangangokuthi bekuze kuthiwe umuntu ongasenamanyala.

Izingane zethu nabazukulu bethu  bazosihlonipha  kanjani  uma  bezwa  ukuthi
umkhulu  oneminyaka  engu-66  udlwengule   usana   olunezinyanga   ezingu-9?
Isithunzi sabantu besilisa sizobuyiselwa kanjani uma namuhla kunabanye  babo
abakwazi ukudlwengula usana olunezinyanga ezintathu?  Ngempela  abadlwenguli
kuhle basiphendule ukuthi yini eyonakele emiqondweni yabo.

Ngesikhathi amakhosi akithi esalwa izimpi, kwakuthi uma  ephaka  impi  ayale
amabutho ukuba angalingi abulale abantu besifazane nezingane ngoba  kuyaziwa
ukuthi abanawo amandla okuzivikela. Ingane encane ngisho  nangokweBhayibheli
ibizwa ngokuthi ingcwele. Kepha kufanele  kwenziwe  njani  uma  abadlwenguli
abanesihluku  bekwazi  ukubulala  imbali  yesizwe  isahluma   ingakaqhakazi?
Ingabe  lolu  hlobo  lwabantu  alusenawo  yini  unembeza  wokubona  ubukhona
bukaMvelinqangi esidalweni esiwumuntu?

Thina esikhule sifundiswa  ngenhlonipho  emakhaya  besingayazi  into  ebizwa

ivezwa yenza umkhosi wezintombi wesiko.

Nginesiqiniseko ukuthi  nakhona  angeke  uzwe  kuthiwa  abafana  badlwengule

Enye inkinga esibhekene nayo ngeyendawo yokuhlala. Le nkinga yenza  amalunga

Sikhuthaza amakhosi nezinduna ezindaweni zasemakhaya ukuba balwisane  nalesi

nomuntu osemncane.

UmNyango wezoBulungiswa siyawukhuthaza ukuba ubhekane  nenselele  yokubukeza
izigwebo  zamacala  okudlwengula.  Izijeziso  ezinkulu  nokusebenza  kanzima
kuphela  esicabanga  ukuthi  kungaba  yikhambi  kulesi  sihlava.  [Ihlombe.]

[Prince B  Z  ZULU:  Chairperson  and  hon  members,  according  to  African
culture, when things are bad like this, the elders are the  ones  who  stand
up and talk.

We had bad luck last week when we heard about small babies who  were  raped.
One asks oneself this question: What has gone wrong  with  people  to  cause
them not to be ashamed of committing such atrocities?

The raping of baby Tshepang, by six men who were already infected  with  the
disease, has shocked the whole world. A man is the protector of  his  family
and his property. He is also the  protector  of  his  own  country.  We,  as
responsible men for our homes and for South Africa, ask ourselves:  What  is
going on with rapists?

The cruelty shown by rapists can be compared to  that  of  a  lion  when  it
stretches its nails to catch a calf of a buffalo when it tries to  run  with
its mother, who, when she sees  her  calf  being  dragged  down,  runs  away
because she cannot help it. Today, our children  and  our  honourable  women
are living in fear of being raped at any time and  also  of  being  infected
with HIV.

According to our culture, which  God  gave  us,  an  old  person  is  highly
respected; so much so that he is  even  regarded  by  his  family  as  their
ancestor. However, this year we heard of a 20-year-old boy who raped an  old
grandmother who was over 90 years of age. In the past an elderly person  was
highly respected and regarded as someone who has no disgrace.

How are our children and grandchildren going to respect us  when  they  hear
that a 66-year-old man has raped a nine-month-old baby? How are we going  to
restore the dignity of men when today some of them are  raping  three-month-
old babies? In fact, rapists should respond to the question we pose to  them
as to what has gone wrong in their minds.

In the olden times, when our kings deployed an army, they  warned  regiments
not to kill women and children because it was  known  that  they  could  not
protect themselves. Even in the Bible, a small child is  referred  to  as  a
holy one. What must be done  now  when  cruel  rapists  destroy  a  nation's
flower  before  it  even  flowers?  Don't  these  types  of  people  have  a
conscience through which they can feel the  existence  of  God  in  a  human
creature?

We as people who were brought up in homes where respect was emphasised,  did
not know the term ``rape''. There at home his Majesty, King  Zwelithini,  in
1984 renewed the Zulu culture, which  is  known  as  ``the  culture  of  the
reed''. When this culture is performed girls dress  in  a  traditional  way.
You never hear of  an  incident  in  which  a  girl  is  raped  during  this
occasion.  Recently, we saw  on  television  inkosi  Tshivhase  of  Northern
Province conducting a girls' ceremony, which is the culture of  his  people.
I am sure that even among his people one will not hear of any  incidents  in
which boys have raped the girls just because they  saw  them  dressed  in  a
traditional way.
Let us work together in teaching and reviving the culture  of  humanity  and
respect in our communities and among our youth. Those who  have  lost  their
conscience, and instead adopted an animal spirit are challenging  the  South
African nation. In the past, young and adult  were  afraid  of  drinking  to
such an extent that they did  not  know  who  they  were.  Some  people  are
overpowered by alcohol. Once they are drunk, they give in to the  temptation
of raping other people. Therefore, if you were  such  a  person,  you  would
have been advised by the elders to stop drinking since it caused you  to  do
unacceptable things.

Another problem that we are facing has to do with the  places  in  which  we
live. This problem has caused family members for opposite sex  to  sleep  in
one room. It is untraditional for an adult male to sleep in one room with  a
female. This is one of the things that encourage these rape  incidents  that
are taking place every time. People who rape  women  and  children  are  not
people of a certain class. They are found across  social  classes.  We  have
rapists from among rich people. There are  rapists  also  among  people  who
hold  senior  positions  in  society.  We  also  have  rapists   from   poor
communities. It is clear that these people,  at  a  certain  time  in  their
lives, forget who they are. They lose their soul  and  become  animals.  How
can a parent with a conscience rape even his own baby? How can a person  who
is psychologically balanced rape a three-month-old baby? How  can  a  person
of integrity say he is curing himself of Aids by  sleeping  with  a  virgin,
while he is infecting that virgin?

We would like to encourage amakhosi and their headmen in the rural areas  to
fight against this character disorder that has affected  the  South  African
nation. Our traditional healers have come out clearly  and  proclaimed  that
sleeping with a virgin or with a young person cannot  heal  an  HIV-positive
person. We would like to encourage the Department  of  Justice  to  consider
the possibility of revising the sentences given to rapists. We believe  that
only heavy penalties and diligence will heal  this  moral  sickness  in  our
nation. [Applause.]]

Mrs G N M PANDOR: Chairperson, we keep hoping that our Parliament  will  not
continue to have to discuss such subjects. I think in the last week many  of
us have observed ourselves expressing justifiable anger  and  shame  at  the
horrific facts of sexual abuse that have hit South  African  headlines  once
more. And I think that each one of us does feel shame at what has  happened.


We emerged just last week from observing  Be  Positive  about  South  Africa
Day, a week in which many positive facts  and  comments  about  our  country
were placed in the public domain. Yet, despite these many positive  features
of South Africa, we continue to be faced with  the  awful  facts  of  sexual
abuse of children and women.

Early media comments on the week's events tended to  imply  inadequacies  in
the justice system, but a review of present law  and  a  record  of  current
innovations in the justice  system  clearly  show  that  policy-makers  have
taken many steps to put the right framework in place.

The courts have a set of laws that lay down  strict  minimum  sentences  for
rapists and increasingly we do see realistic, stiff sentences  being  handed
down. If indeed there are loopholes in the law, we need to examine the  laws
as Parliament and make recommendations on further tightening of the law  and
on necessary innovations that will help us to address this blight.

Certain newspapers have had articles that have suggested that  some  rapists
assault children because of their  mistaken  belief  that  sexual  relations
with a child will rid them of Aids. This is a ridiculous and dangerous  myth
that is entirely devoid of any truth. Any person fed  such  a  myth  by  any
traditional doctor or healer should  realise,  from  today,  that  raping  a
child will not save them. All it will do is put them  in  jail  for  a  long
time.

The time has also come for our country  to  give  serious  consideration  to
keeping a register of sexual offenders, particularly those found  guilty  of
assaulting minors. Such a  register  should  be  made  available  at  police
stations or courts closest to the residence of the abuser  and  all  parents
and women should have the right to see such a register. The  time  has  come
for bold steps. We cannot continue to protect these abusers in any way.

Of course, the justice system, the police and prison services can only do  a
part of what needs to be done. The question then is: What should we, as  the
people of South Africa, do, to put an end to this moral blight  on  all  our
people? There is no longer time for us to point fingers  at  Government,  at
the police, the judges and the prison services. I think now each one of  us,
as South Africans, must ask what we should do.

I think, more importantly, as we reflect on these honest questions, we  need
to stop the situation where certain men in  our  society  take  this  matter
lightly. I observed some laughter as we debated this subject. I find that  a
very unfortunate reaction and unacceptable. We have  a  serious  problem  in
our country and I think we need to approach it very seriously.

It seems to me that we have to ask, first of all: What do we need to  do  in
our homes to protect women and children? What should we do in our  churches?
What should we do in our schools? What  should  be  done  in  our  community
halls? What should be done by our newspapers? What should the role of  radio
be? What do we do in our places of work - not  just  at  home,  but  in  our
factories, in our hotels, in our workshops and everywhere else? What  do  we
do to respond to this very serious national problem?

I think each one of us has a role to play: a role in changing  the  attitude
and mind-set of men in our country. Change cannot be left to  NGOs,  nor  to
women's organisations. Some people imagine it is  a  problem  of  women  and
therefore it is women's components of political parties that  take  up  this
issue and others do not, the male members particularly. It is not a  problem
of women. Women are the victims, men are the perpetrators.

Mention was made that there are some cases where women have abused  children
themselves by encouraging minors to engage in sexual  relations  with  adult
females, but the nature of the problem that we confront in  our  country  is
that men tend to regard  children  and  women  as  available  for  free  and
abusive sexual relations. This is the character that we must change.

Men have to begin to lead and sustain a campaign of  change.  They  have  to
lead a commitment to  the  security  and  dignity  of  women  and  children.
Without such a national  campaign  we  will  not  succeed  in  changing  the
situation and we will debate this subject again in 2002.

Every household, street and town and our whole country should make a  public
pledge to stop violence against, and the abuse of, women and children.  Each
one of us, in our streets, homes,  towns  and  country  should  then  assume
responsibility for monitoring adherence to such a pledge.

Each one of us will  next  week  return  to  our  constituencies.  In  those
constituencies that we have, let us, as members of Parliament,  go  door  to
door - in Maseko Street in Orlando West, in Phiri Street,  Meadowlands,  and
in every street where there are residential areas, let us have  people  sign
a pledge to protect women and children. Let it become  public.  Let  us,  as
members of Parliament, begin a campaign against the abuse  of  children  and
women.

I also think that one of the  features  that  we  tend  to  neglect  in  our
deliberations on this issue is  that  a  great  deal  of  this  violence  is
associated with the  abuse  of  alcohol.  Recreation  and  alcohol  are  too
closely associated in South Africa.

We have done much as Parliament to reduce tobacco addiction and the  use  of
tobacco, particularly in public places, but we have hardly - in fact,  never
broached  the  terrible  impact  of  alcohol,  particularly  in   poor   and
vulnerable communities.

Those men who raped that child - I do not know  the  facts  surrounding  the
case, but I can almost without fear of  contradiction  assume  that  alcohol
was associated with their actions. We need to confront this issue.

I think as well that we have to address a number  of  issues.  For  example,
mention has been made of teachers' infringement of the right of  pupils  and
of school principals' infringements of the  right  of  female  teachers.  We
need to look at a stronger code of  regulation  in  order  to  ensure  swift
action - against perpetrators of such acts in our public  schools.  How  can
it be that teachers do not see themselves  as  protectors  of  children?  We
have to encourage action and look at the code of  conduct  with  respect  to
teachers, and look at how we put in place swift action - justice,  yes,  but
with swift action - because the protection  of  children  and  of  women  is
important. We also need to educate children on the rights  that  they  have.
In our schools we should have programmes of awareness for every child.

We also need to address the important matter of  providing  counselling  and
psychological services, both for perpetrators  and  for  victims.  It  would
appear from comments that we have seen in the media that, in  fact,  in  the
area  of  Upington,  where  this  terrible  blight  happened,   insufficient
counselling services exist to support the family, and to begin  to  work  on
these men who have done this terrible deed. We clearly have to look at  what
form  of  support  we  are  providing  in  the  area  of   counselling   and
psychological services because our country has to rely to a great degree  on
the rehabilitation of the perpetrators once they  have  been  locked  up  in
prison for a very long time.

We must also  look  at  the  issue  of  how  we  find  and  create  job  and
educational opportunities for young men.  A  large  number  of  these  rapes
appear to be committed by young boys aged 15 to 25. So we  have  to  address
what it is that makes them commit these rapes. Are they unemployed? Do  they
lack education? How do we address the need to ensure that  they  do  not  go
into these forms of practices?

In conclusion, I would like to say that it is important that our  Parliament
and we, ourselves, as parliamentarians, be very wary of reacting  in  a  way
that points to a rejection of the essential features of our Constitution.

We have decided, as a new democracy, to create a system of just law  in  our
country. While, emotionally and in anger, I might support some of the  harsh
action that has been proposed by some of  my  colleagues  today,  I  believe
Parliament has a vital responsibility to uphold the law and to  ensure  that
the law works.

This is not, in any way,  a  sign  of  sympathy  for  perpetrators,  but  an
indication that we have a responsibility  beyond  our  anger.  We  make  the
laws, we make the system work and we have  to  ensure  that,  indeed,  those
inherent elements of promoting the dignity, security  and  wealth  of  every
being are upheld. We cannot give up on those principles.

I also believe that as we act to solve these problems, it is vital that,  as
Parliament,  we  continue  to  uphold  the   essential   contents   of   the
Constitution of our country. If we gave up on that, I believe we would  have
a far worse situation than  the  terrible  plight  we  face  at  this  time.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST AND ABUSE OF CHILDREN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  I  thank  hon  members  for  all  their
constructive contributions. I have a special word of thanks  for  the  Chief
Whip of the Council, who started the convention of concluding  debates  such
as this one with a resolution of the House. I have before  me  a  resolution
by the Chief Whip of the Council on the subject of this  discussion,  namely
violence and abuse against children, to which all the parties in this  House
have agreed. I therefore move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its anger and outrage  at  the  heinous  deeds  perpetrated
       against our vulnerable children of tender years and at  the  growing
       incidence of child abuse;


  (2) calls on our prosecutors to take special note of  the  provisions  of
       section 60 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which has been amended and
       permits bail only in exceptional circumstances  where  such  violent
       and heinous crimes are committed;


  (3) notes that amendments have been made to the  Criminal  Law  Amendment
       Act which provides for minimum sentences where sexual  offences  are
       committed, more especially when the victim is a girl under  the  age
       of 16 years;


  (4) is of the view that the violence and aggravating circumstances should
       receive sufficient weight  so  that  appropriate  harsh  and  severe
       sentences of incarceration, which would act as a  deterrent  against
       perpetrators, can be imposed;


  (5)  calls  on  religious  communities,  civic  organisations,  NGOs  and
       community-based organisations  to  support  the  Government  in  its
       efforts to fight these crimes;


  (6) is of the view that the overhaul of the Sexual  Offences  Act,  1957,
       should be expedited - such overhaul would include a  review  of  the
       definition of rape, the  commercial  exploitation  of  children  and
       offences against mentally impaired children;
  (7) calls on the Government to focus on  the  Law  Commission  Report  on
       compulsory HIV tests;


  (8) calls on our schools to intensify  their  awareness  and  educational
       programmes which are in place, in relation to child abuse and sexual
       misconduct;


  (9) believes that teachers and/or school principals who are found  guilty
       of abusing  schoolchildren  should  be  excluded  from  ever  having
       responsibility for or control over children;


  (10)      calls  on  local  and  provincial   governments   to   increase
       psychological and emotional  resources  at  regional,  district  and
       local level to assist victims and their families;


  (11)     urges the media,  electronic  and  written,  to  assist  in  the
       education and awareness programmes initiated by the Government;


  (12)     believes that the programmes  of  the  GCIS,  which  works  with
       committees and communities, should  be  intensified,  supported  and
       promoted;
  (13)     is of the view that  an  integrated  approach  among  all  three
       spheres of government be followed  in  eliminating  the  scourge  of
       violence against and abuse of children;


  (14)      believes  that  Special  Sexual   Offence   Courts   with   the
       multidisciplinary support  centres  to  empower  victims  of  sexual
       offences should be expanded;


  (15)     calls on men, who are generally the  perpetrators,  to  be  more
       vocal and lead  the  march  against  sexual  and  violent  abuse  of
       children;


  (16)     is of the opinion that  high-quality  investigations  should  be
       conducted to track down and persecute perpetrators;


  (17)     commends the establishment of a specialised Directorate,  called
       the Sexual Offences and Community Affairs Directorate, to deal  with
       sexual offences;


  (18)     calls on progressive  traditional  healers  to  send  out  clear
       messages that having carnal relations with children who are  virgins
       cannot cure HIV/Aids and to assist in the  education  and  awareness
       programmes;


  (19)     is of the view that illegitimate traditional healers responsible
       for the dissemination of false information should  be  arrested  and
       prosecuted;


  (20)     calls on portfolio and select committees of Parliament  to  give
       special consideration to this aspect in their work;


  (21)     requests traditional leaders  to  assist  in  the  educating  of
       communities in rural areas;


  (22)     believes that consumption of alcohol should be better regulated;


  (23)     urges all its members to make a  dedicated  effort  during  this
       recess period to raise this important  issue  in  their  interaction
       with communities and sustain such programmes  in  all  their  public
       engagements in the future;


  (24)     calls for the compilation  of  a  register  of  paedophiles  and
       sexual abusers of children; and


  (25)     resolves  that  the  motion  be  referred  to  the  offices  and
       institutions mentioned to enable them to act on this resolution.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 11:07.
