Mr S M RASMENI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister of Minerals and Energy, the hon Phumzile
       Mlambo-Ngcuka, was honoured with a Tribute Achievers Award 2001, for
       her role in empowering women;

       initiative and a return to democracy in the DRC;

  (2) commends the DA for its proactive steps to save the children of HIV-
       positive mothers through the provision of antiretroviral drugs to
       pregnant women in clinics in the Western Cape, a service which will
       be available to 95% of pregnant women who attend clinics in the
       province within a year; and

       provide accessible care to HIV-positive South Africans, particularly

  That the House -


  (1) sadly notes that one TB hospital in the Western Cape and two in the
       Eastern Cape are going to close due to mismanagement by Santa;


  (2) is concerned that Santa has caused a public outcry over its ill-
       treatment of patients who had paid for admission to these hospitals,
       expecting decent treatment; and


  (3) calls on the Department of Health to monitor the activities of Santa
       in hospitals closely so that patients receive the care they deserve.

sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the comments by the National Director of Public Prosecutions,
       Adv Bulelani Ngcuka, that interventions by the police and his Office
       have brought an end to political violence in KwaZulu-Natal and urban
       terror in Cape Town;

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the confession made by Mr P Naidoo, convicted accused in a cash-
       in-transit robbery, that R31 million was used to fund the SACP; and


  (2) urges President Mbeki to investigate the allegations, demand that the
       ANC-SACP alliance partners come clean and inform the nation if they
       received any funding before or after 27 April 1994 from the proceeds
       of crime.

Ms A VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its disgust at several embarrassing incidents of criminal
       behaviour involving the VIP Unit protecting the President, members of
       the Cabinet and members of the Executive Councils of provinces;


  (2) notes that various incidents of fraud, hijacking, theft and
       corruption are a direct reflection of the unit's incompetences, which
       is further exacerbated by the ANC's dysfunctional strategy of
       interfering in the appointment  of undisciplined members to the VIP
       Unit; and
  (3) questions the appointment procedures and the lack of proper criminal
       liability checks and balances on members of the VIP Unit that are
       fraught with various levels of crime.

Mr M A MAPHALALA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the MEC for social services and population development,
       Angeline Motshekga, launched a children's court in Sebokeng on
       Monday;


  (2) believes that this signals a commitment by Government to  provide
       resources and to ensure that those who are guilty of child abuse face
       the full wrath of the law; and


  (3) welcomes this new project by Government to bring courts closer to the
       people.

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:
  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with dismay the lack of knowledge that some parliamentarians and
           the Government display regarding the South African Constitution;


       (b)  that such incidences of ignorance are displayed to the public on
           a regular basis;


       (c)  that the lack of knowledge of the Constitution is severely
           hampering the efficient and correct working of Parliament, and
           as a consequence is impeding the accountability process; and


       (d)  that Parliament and the Government cannot expect citizens of
           South Africa to have respect for them or the institutions they
           represent whilst such ignorance remains commonplace amongst
           parliamentarians;


  (2) calls on the Speaker to institute a compulsory programme of education
       on the Constitution for all parliamentarians; and
  (3) suggests that, following such a compulsory programme of
       constitutional education, all parliamentarians must sit for a
       compulsory examination on the Constitution before taking their place
       in Parliament and participating in parliamentary procedures.

[Applause.]

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the FA:


  That the House -


  (1) commends the Minister and the Departments of Agriculture and Land
       Affairs for the ongoing negotiations to resolve the issue of the
       expropriation of the farm Boomplaatz, in the Lydenberg area; and


  (2) notes that this mature approach augurs well for the resolution of
       similar problems, such as the Mangethe invasions in KwaZulu-Natal and
       elsewhere.

[Applause.]
Mrs M L NGWENYA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Agri South Africa, the National African Farmers Union, the
       SA Agricultural, Plantation and Allied Workers Union, and the Food
       and Allied Workers Union have signed an agreement which will, amongst
       other things, make it easier for unions to recruit on farms;


  (2) further notes that the agreement covered wide-ranging  issues,
       including employment conditions, human rights issues, HIV/Aids and
       social security benefits; and


  (3) welcomes this agreement as it will contribute positively to the
       normalisation of labour relations on farms.

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the ANC-run Durban Unicity has hired Linda Zama Management
       Consultancy as a public relations consultant at R112 000 per month -
       R82 600 per month more than the lowest bidder;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  in January this year, the ANC gave Linda Zama a R232 000 bail-
           out to settle her outstanding legal fees; and


       (b)  the council is spending R185 000 to upgrade the mayoral 4x4
           vehicle, while the city is facing an unprecedented 29% increase
           in their water bills; and


  (3) therefore calls on the ANC in the Durban Unicity to revoke its
       contract with Linda Zama Management Consultancy and its decision to
       upgrade the mayoral vehicle and to focus on the important issue of
       service delivery to all the people of Durban.

[Applause.]

Nkk L R MBUYAZI: Somlomo, ngenza isaziso sokuthi ngelanga elilandelayo
lokuhlala kweNdlu ngiyophakamisa:
  Ukuthi leNdlu-


  (1) ishaqekile kakhulu ngoukuzwa ngomfundi wesikole uMzomusha Primary
       eNanda, KwaZulu-Natali, uPhilisiwe Zulu (14) otholakale eshonile

       ukuba abafundi abaningi balesi sikole badlwengulwe futhi babulawe,
       licatshwe ukuze kuphephe izingane.
(Translation of Zulu notice of motion follows.)

[Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, on the next sitting day of the House I
shall move:
  That the House-


  (1) is shocked to hear about Philisiwe Zulu (14), a student of Mzomusha
       Primary School in Nanda, KwaZulu-Natal, whose decomposing body was
       found, and it is suspected that she was raped and then shot dead;


  (2) sympathises with the Zulu family and prays that they recover quickly
       from this tragedy;


  (3) is surprised and perturbed that after the suspect had been caught, he
       was released on the grounds that there was not enough evidence
       linking him to the crime; and


  (4) proposes that the forest near the school, in which many students have
       been raped and killed, should be destroyed, as this will save the
       lives of our children.]

Chief M NONKONYANA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with profound sadness the death of Mr Sithembiso Mashiyane,
       Chairperson of the UDM in Philippi;


  (2) further notes that he was robbed of his firearm and cellphone before
       being fatally wounded with a firearm;


  (3) condemns this senseless criminal act and calls on the community to
       assist the police in their investigations; and


  (4) expresses and sends its heartfelt condolences to the Mashiyane
       family, friends and relatives.

[Applause.]

Mr I J PRETORIUS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the executive mayor of Tshwane has allocated R2,5 million
       of the budget for the erection and maintenance of an official
       residence;


  (2) further notes with alarm that the need to entertain guests is given
       as one of the main reasons for the erection of the official
       residence;


  (3) urges the mayor of Tshwane not to waste taxpayers' money on
       extravagant status symbols while local government is in a financial
       crisis and services are deteriorating; and


  (4) calls on the mayor rather to focus on the people's needs and to spend
       his time and effort on improving service delivery to all the people.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its concern at the announcement yesterday by Statistics
       South Africa that real GDP growth for the first quarter of this year
       was only 2%;


  (2) notes that not only is this growth down from 3,2% in the previous
       quarter, but that it will also be virtually impossible to reach the
       Government's 3,5% growth rate targeted for this year;


  (3) acknowledges that a continuous and minimum real growth rate of 4% is
       the bare minimum for South Africa to turn around the unemployment
       crisis and activate a sharp increase in the rate of investment; and


  (4) further notes that the above-stated scenario, together with the
       continued pressure on citizens in the form of escalating fuel prices,
       all translate into increased suffering for the poorest of the poor.

Mrs T P SHILUBANA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the national Department of Health has criticised the
       Universities of Stellenbosch and the Free State for disadvantaging
       black students by offering medical courses in Afrikaans;


  (2) believes that it is morally wrong and unethical to use language to
       disadvantage a section of our population and that this is a
       perpetuation of the discriminatory practices of the past;


  (3) further believes that language should be used for communication and
       to enhance unity in diversity amongst our people;


  (4) echoes the sentiments expressed by the national Department of Health;
       and


  (5) calls on these two institutions of higher learning to desist from
       using language to disadvantage and divide our people.

[Applause.]

                             (Draft Resolution)

  (1) notes that last Friday the University of Fort Hare conferred an
       honorary Doctor of Law degree on Deputy President Jacob Zuma;


  (2) further notes that last Saturday Medunsa conferred an honorary Doctor
       of Philosophy degree on Deputy President Jacob Zuma;

       acknowledgement of the prominent role that Deputy President Zuma has
       played in the struggle for a democratic, nonracial and nonsexist

  (4) congratulates Deputy President Zuma on these historic achievements.

                             (Draft Resolution)
Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) acknowledges the formation of the African Union, which will consist
       of an executive, a central bank, an African Parliament and a court of
       justice, all of which will be seized with the responsibility of -


       (a)  promoting parliamentary democracy, while recognising human

       of the African Union; and

Agreed to.

The House adjourned at 16:15.

     considered Budget Vote 5: Provincial and Local Government, reports as
     follows:


     A.     Introduction


         1. The budget review of the Ministry and the Department of
              Provincial and Local Government was undertaken on 8, 9, 15 and
              16 May 2001.


         2. Those who appeared before the Committee included Minister F S
              Mufamadi, Director-General Mr Z Titus, Deputy Directors-
              General Mr E Africa, Ms J Manche and Mr G Mokate, Chief
              Financial Officer Mr C Clerihew, Chief Directors Mr R Botha,
              Mr L Buys, Mr R Kruger and Mr T Seboka, Directors Mr D Powell
              and Ms E Magwaza, and Deputy Director Ms K Harrison.


              The National House of Traditional Leaders was represented by
              its Chairperson, Inkosi M Mzimela, Deputy Chairperson, Morena
              M Mopeli, Kgoshi M Malekane, Kgosi M Mashile, Kgosi S Suping,
              and Administration Assistant Ms V Dyani-Maleka. The delegation
              from the Municipal Infrastructure Investment Unit (MIIU)
              consisted of the Chairperson of the Board, Ms M Hesketh, Board
              Member Mr M Msiwa, CEO Ms G Moloi, and Project Manager Mr D
              Leigland.


              The Municipal Demarcation Board was represented by its
              Chairperson, Dr M Sutcliffe, Board Member Mr V Mlokoti and
              Manager Mr H Monare. Local Government Water and Related
              Services SETA was represented by its Chairperson, Mr J
              Mohlala, Deputy Chairperson Mr S Mqaka and Administrative
              Manager Mr E Mnyakeng. The South African Local Government
              Association (SALGA) was represented by its Chairperson, Father
              S Mkhatshwa, Deputy Chairperson Ms H Jenkins, Treasurer Mr J
              Mokoena, and CEO Mr T Mokwena.


         3. A full-day workshop was held with the Department on 6 March
              2001, at which the programmes, plans and strategies of the
              Department were discussed. This served as a precursor to the
              budget review.


         4. The Committee notes with appreciation that, unlike previous
              years, the reports from the Department and statutory bodies
              were submitted in reasonably good time. Consistent with the
              requirements of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), the
              Department's report was much more user-friendly this year. It
              was difficult to properly evaluate the reports of the majority
              of the statutory bodies. It would be useful if the Department
              would assist the statutory bodies to present appropriate
              reports to Parliament that are more consistent with the
              requirements of the PFMA. The Committee urges the statutory
              bodies to present reports that, among other things, more
              clearly set out how they have used the money allocated to them
              during the previous financial year, what the outcomes of their
              programmes and activities are, and how they plan to use the
              money allocated to them for the present financial year.


     B.     Minister's Overview


         1. The Minister provided an overview of the Ministry and
              Department's programme for the year. He said that the
              Department had been restructured and was now on a better
              footing to fulfil its objectives and programmes. These revolve
              around the need to "strengthen systems of good governance
              without which sustainable socio-economic development is not
              possible".


         2. He explained that the Department's work would contribute to
              advancing some of the key priorities identified in the
              President's "State of the Nation" address. These include a job-
              creating economic growth path, rural development and urban
              renewal, and ensuring that the poor and disadvantaged are at
              the centre of development.


         3. "The inauguration of the new local government system has
              brought us to the end of the beginning. What we are doing
              today is likely to have an enduring effect on the shape of
              governance in the lifetime of many generations to come", the
              Minister said. He stressed that the challenge in the next two
              to three years is to stabilise and consolidate the new system
              of local government. He explained that a joint Local
              Government and Finance MINMEC is to be held soon to consider
              the fiscal framework for local government, review the system
              of intergovernmental fiscal transfers, and strengthen local
              government revenue-raising capabilities by reforming property
              rates and tariffs. The Ministry and Treasury are "near to a
              solution" on councillor allowances. SALGA was also being drawn
              into the process. "It should be remembered that developmental
              local government requires that capable people are attracted to
              municipalities as councillors."


         4. The Minister felt that Intergovernmental Relations (IGR) has to
              be strengthened. As part of its concern to ensure this, the
              Department had reviewed its operational strategies with the
              aid of the IGR Audit Report. A chief directorate had been
              established to focus on strengthening the Department's IGR
              work.


         5. The provincial system is an important part of the co-operative
              governance system, said the Minister. This did not mean that
              its boundaries were cast in stone. To some extent its
              boundaries were the outcome of political negotiations. The
              boundaries of the new municipalities, however, were determined
              on the basis of developmental considerations. The
              establishment of municipalities that straddled provincial
              boundaries raised the question of whether some parts of the
              provincial boundaries should be reviewed.


         6. The Minister explained that the Department is to co-ordinate
              the implementation of the Integrated Sustainable Rural
              Development Strategy (ISRDS) and the Urban Renewal Strategy
              (URS). Preparations to launch the ISRDS programme on 1 July is
              fairly advanced.


         7. The Minister explained that a Cabinet committee is attending to
              the concerns of traditional leaders. A Bill would be
              introduced in Parliament shortly, dealing with the powers and
              functions of traditional leaders in local government. It would
              not be an amendment to the Local Govenment: Municipal
              Structures Act, but a separate Bill. In response to a
              question, he said that he did not think the threat of
              councillors in KwaZulu-Natal to stop fulfilling their
              responsibilities from 20 May unless the concerns of
              traditional leaders about their powers and functions in local
              government were addressed, constituted a "crisis". The
              concerns of traditional leaders cannot be addressed by the
              Cabinet alone. The Committee and the public generally must
              also have a say, he said.


         8. The Minister acknowledged the valuable role played by, among
              others, the Committee, SALGA, the Municipal Demarcation Board,
              the Independent Electoral Commission and the Independent
              Development Trust (IDT).


     C.     Restructuring of Department


         1. The Department has finalised its restructuring. This
              restructuring has been necessary because of the new mandate of
              the Department, the need for greater integration and
              effectiveness, the requirements of the PFMA and the need to be
              more representative.


         2. The Department now functions through three branches -
              Governance and Development, Institutional Reform and Support,
              and Support Services.


         3. The Department has four programmes - Administration; Governance
              and Development; Institutional Reform and Support; and
              Auxiliary and Associated Services. Among the key
              subprogrammes, activities and structures that fall under
              Governance and Development are the following:
              Intergovernmental Relations; Development and Planning;
              Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme; Local
              Economic Development; Social Plan Fund; and the Municipal
              Infrastructure Investment Unit.


              Under Institutional Reform and Support are to be found the
              following: SALGA and related issues; local government
              "equitable share"; Local Government Transition Fund;
              Institutional Capacity-building and Support; Performance
              Management and Municipal Finance; Municipal Systems
              Improvement Programme; and Disaster Management. Under
              Auxiliary and Associated Services the Department provides
              support to the National House of Traditional Leaders, the
              Municipal Demarcation Board, and Public Sectoral Training
              Authority. The Commission for the Promotion and Protection of
              the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities
              falls under this programme as well.


         4. The Committee feels that compared to last year the Department
              has made significant improvements in clarifying its
              structures, and there is a better relationship between the
              Department's structures and objectives. The Committee feels
              that more should be done to appoint women at senior management
              level.
              The Committee is also interested in what the Department is
              doing to employ disabled people. The Committee feels that it
              would be appropriate for the Department to provide a breakdown
              of the category "Blacks" employed in the Department so that a
              better sense of representivity can be arrived at.


              While representivity is important, the Committee feels that
              civil servants, generally, whatever their background, have to
              seek to be more productive, given the challenges of
              transformation confronting our country.


     D.     Overview of Budget


         1. R4 279 165 000 has been allocated to the Ministry and
              Department of Provincial and Local Government for this
              financial year. This represents an increase of 6,3% in real
              terms compared to last year. Over the next two years the
              Ministry and Department's budget is expected to increase by
              29,2% in terms of the MTEF.


         2. There has been an increase in local government's "equitable
              share" from R2 330 000 000 last year to R2 618 000 000 this
              year. This is a 12,3% increase in real terms. Over the MTEF
              period there will be a significant increase of 52,4%. If the
              other grants are added to the "equitable share", the total
              allocated to local government is R6 507 000 000. This is a
              6,3% increase in real terms over last year, and over the next
              two years of the MTEF period the increase will average 10,3%
              per annum.


         3. Overall, the majority in the Committee feels that the
              Department made reasonably good use of the budget allocated to
              it for the last financial year. There has, however, been
              underspending in certain areas. The explanations from the
              Department seem reasonable in most cases.


              The most significant case of underspending is the R31,9
              million in respect of CMIP funds. This was due mainly to the
              expected cash-flow on various projects not materialising
              through delays in project approvals and project implementation
              resulting from the municipal elections, redemarcation and
              municipal restructuring. R23,7 million of LED funds was not
              spent because of delays occasioned by the elections and
              financial discipline requirements. The Department's
              underspending on personnel was because it could not fill
              vacancies until its restructuring process was finalised.
              Project viability funds of R2,4 million was not paid to
              consultants due to a lack of adequate reporting.


              The Commmittee notes that the budget for the Commission for
              the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural,
              Religious and Linguistic Communities has increased from R3,5
              million to R6,7 million. While recognising the need for the
              fullest consultation, the Committee feels that the Commission
              should be launched within the next year. Overall, the
              Committee feels, however, that it needs to improve its
              capacity to evaluate the outcomes of the Department's
              expenditures.


         4. The Committee is aware that allocating more money does not
              necessarily mean better outcomes, and that departments have to
              have appropriate capacity to productively use increased funds.
              However, given the magnitude of the local government
              transformation, the responsibilities of co-ordinating the
              ISRDS and URS, and the need to consolidate IGR, the majority
              of the Committee feels that consideration should be given to
              significantly increasing the Department's budget in future
              years.


     E.     Legislative Programme


         1. The Department is to introduce the following legislation this
              year:


              (a) Traditional Authorities: Powers and Functions Bill.


              (b) Disaster Management Bill.


              (c) Remuneration of Traditional Office Bearers Amendment Bill.


              (d) Local Government: Property Rating Bill.


              (e) Repeal of Outdated Local Government Legislation Bill.


              (f) Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights
                  of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities Bill.


              (g) Volkstaat Council Bill.


              (h) Possible legislation emanating from the White Paper on
                  Traditional Leadership and Institutions.


     F.     Intergovernmental Relations (IGR)


         1. The consolidation and strengthening of IGR and the system of co-
              operative governance is the key function of the Department.


         2. The Department feels that it is premature to have omnibus
              legislation on IGR at this stage. In any case, existing
              legislation such as the Municipal Systems Act, the
              Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Act and other pieces of
              legislation introduced after 1994 facilitate IGR.


         3. The Committee feels that a key test of the IGR system is the
              extent to which there is an improvement in service delivery
              and development. While co-ordination between government
              departments and between the spheres of government has
              improved, there is still a long way to go. The Committee feels
              that there needs to be more specific indicators by which
              improvements in the IGR can be measured. The majority in the
              Committee welcomes the initiatives to explore the possibility
              of including municipal employees as part of the country's
              civil service.


     G.     Local Government Transformation


         1. The Department set out its local government transformation
              programme. The next two years have been identified as the
              "stabilisation phase". In March 2001, R100 million was
              allocated to municipalities from the Local Government
              Transition Fund. Key strategic areas of support the Department
              is providing to municipalities include financial planning and
              management, human resource reorganisation, information
              technology, development and service delivery, and governance.


         2. The Department is also working on a review of the local
              government financial system. This includes the fiscal powers
              and functions of District and Local Municipalities, funding
              free basic services and the equitable share, funding of
              District Municipalities, property rates, and other issues.


         3. Together with SALGA, the Department has organised capacity-
              building programmes and workshops for councillors, municipal
              managers and treasurers. About 7 500 councillors and officials
              have been trained.


         4. The Department has also established Planning and Implementation
              Management Support Centres (PIMS) in 14 district
              municipalities. The Department is paying special attention to
              those municipalities that have been established in the areas
              where previously there were no municipalities. A special
              support programme for metropolitan municipalities, especially
              the two new ones, and "aspirant metros" is under way.


         5. The Committee recognises the magnitude of the local government
              transformation and is acutely aware of the challenges in
              implementing the new system of local government. The Committee
              feels that the success of the new system of local government
              depends crucially on an effective, phased programme of
              implementation that secures the maximum co-operation of all
              the key stakeholders, including national and provincial
              governments, SALGA, municipalities, public representatives in
              all three spheres, the Municipal Demarcation Board, trade
              unions, the private sector, traditional leaders, and a wide
              range of civil society organisations.


              The majority in the Committee feels that it could take up to
              10 years to properly implement the new system of local
              government. The Committee would like to pursue with the
              Department the fine-tuning and development of its local
              government transformation programme. The Committee notes that
              the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act provides for the
              phased implementation of aspects of the new system based on a
              municipality's capacity, resources and funding. The Committee
              would like to pursue further with the Department how aspects
              of that Act are being implemented.


         6. The Committee feels that the Department's support to
              municipalities established in areas where previously there
              were no municipalities, should be strengthened. There also
              needs to be greater clarity about the position of "aspirant
              metros".


         7. Key to the success of the new local government system is a
              fundamental review of the local government financial system -
              and the Committee urges that, the difficulties
              notwithstanding, this process be speeded up. The majority in
              the Committee feels that serious consideration should be given
              to paying councillors' salaries and allowances from the
              national fiscus. The Committee is acutely aware of the
              constraints on the national fiscus, but believes that
              consideration should also be given to paying full-time
              councillors salaries that take into account the salaries of
              MPs and MPLs, where possible. The Committee is also concerned
              about the huge gap between the salaries of councillors and the
              allowances of part-time councillors, especially where the
              latter are ward councillors.


              The Committee understands that all these issues cannot be
              fully addressed immediately, but urges that consideration be
              given to them in the process of finalising the next national
              budget.


         8. The Committee suggests that the Department considers setting up
              a "Help-Desk" for municipalities seeking advice on aspects of
              the implementation of the new local government system. This
              could be done in consultation with SALGA. The "Help-Desk"
              could also assist municipalities to avoid incurring expenses
              through the use of specialist lawyers or consultants. Together
              with SALGA, the Department should also consider compiling a
              register of consultants and provide advice on the quality of
              consultants work and the fees paid to them.
         9. The Committee is to receive regular briefings from the
              Department and other stakeholders on the local government
              transformation, and will be undertaking a study tour of
              municipalities in the last quarter of this year to evaluate
              progress in the implementation of the transformation.


     H.     Free Basic Municipal Services


         1. The Committee welcomes the government's commitment to providing
              free basic water and electricity services to the poor. It
              appreciates the many financial and other challenges in
              implementing this commitment, especially in respect of
              electricity, and that its implementation may have to be phased
              in. The Committee urges, however, that those municipalities
              that are able to do so should implement the free provision of
              basic services from 1 July this year.


         2. The Committee will be arranging regular briefings from the
              relevant departments and other stakeholders on progress with
              the provision of free basic services.
     I.     Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme (CMIP), Local
         Economic Development (LED) Fund and Social Plan Fund


         1. From its inception in 1996 until March this year, the CMIP has
              allocated R3,3 billion to 1 989 projects. For this financial
              year, the CMIP has been allocated just over R994 million for
              capital transfers.


         2. The LED Fund has allocated R111 million to 120 projects up to
              April 2001. Until December 2000, the LED Fund created 1 817
              full-time and 1 813 part-time jobs.


         3. The Social Plan Fund, which was established after the 1998 Jobs
              Summit, provides funds to municipalities to undertake local
              economic regeneration studies. Almost 50 studies have been
              completed to date.


         4. The Committee feels that these three projects can make a
              valuable contribution to the government's economic growth, job
              creation and development goals.  The Committee welcomes the
              increasing rural orientation of the CMIP and the impact it is
              making. It is less sure about the effect of the LED and Social
              Plan subprogrammes, and would like to pursue its concerns with
              the Department regarding this. The Committee welcomes the
              Department's efforts to integrate these three subprogrammes.


     J.     Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Strategy (ISRDS) and
         Urban Renewal Strategy (URS)


         1. The Department explained that theirs is a co-ordinating role in
              ensuring the implementation of the ISRDS and URS. The
              Department is to set up a special unit to take responsibility
              for this co-ordinating role. The Department is working closely
              with the IDT, which is the support arm for the implementation
              of the ISRDS. The implementation of the programmes depends on
              the co-operation of several departments, all three spheres of
              government, the IDT, and a range of other stakeholders.


         2. While the vision, strategies and plans of the ISRDS are fairly
              developed, the URS is lagging somewhat behind. The ISRDS is a
              10-year phased implementation plan. It will be launched not
              later than 1 July 2001. 13 nodes have already been identified
              by the President and there will be 30 nodes by the end of this
              year. It is estimated that 10 million people will benefit from
              the ISRDS.


         3. The Committee is enthusiastic about the ISRDS and URS, and
              commits itself to contributing to its implementation in
              whatever way it can. It feels that MPs living or doing
              political work in the nodal areas should be drawn in to assist
              with monitoring and implementing the programmes. The Committee
              feels that these programmes have significant potential to
              contribute to consolidating IGR and the system of co-operative
              governance.


     K.     Traditional Leadership and Institutions


         1. A Bill on the powers and functions of traditional leaders in
              local government will be introduced in Parliament shortly. The
              Ministry and Department are consulting with traditional
              leaders and a range of other stakeholders before finalising
              the Bill.


         2. A Green Paper and a White Paper on Traditional Leadership and
              Institutions will be processed this year.


         3. While the Committee understands the difficulties, it feels that
              the Ministry's and Department's work on Traditional Leadership
              and Institutions should be speeded up.


     L.     South African Local Government Association (SALGA)


         1. SALGA had just elected a new leadership at its conference held
              early in April 2001. It also appointed a new CEO in the second
              half of last year. SALGA is undergoing an internal
              restructuring process. With the local government elections
              over, a new leadership elected and a measure of restructuring
              undertaken, SALGA is developing a programme to meet the
              challenges of implementing the new system of local government.


         2. Aspects of SALGA's programme also revolve around the need to
              enhance the quality of service to its members; create greater
              cohesion amongst its structures; develop a better relationship
              with other organisations relevant to local government;
              strengthen its capacity-building strategies; and improve its
              human resource management.


         3. SALGA has been allocated R15 million for the current financial
              year. According to a study commissioned, SALGA explained that
              it would need R9,2 million just to respond to the impact of
              the local government transition on its work.


         4. The Committee feels that SALGA is indispensable to ensuring the
              success of the new system of local government. While the
              Committee appreciates the difficulties SALGA has had to
              contend with over the past year, it feels that SALGA needs to
              be more decisive and effective. There is a need to also
              improve SALGA's involvement in the parliamentary process. The
              Committee notes that the report submitted to it is not
              adequate to properly evaluate SALGA's use of its budget during
              the past financial year and how it intends to use its budget
              during the current financial year. The Committee urges that an
              appropriate report be submitted next year. The Committee will
              have a meeting with SALGA within six months to discuss matters
              of common concern.


     M.     National House of Traditional Leaders


         1. Much of the past year of the House of Traditional Leaders was
              taken up by negotiations through the Coalition of Traditional
              Leaders with the government on the powers and functions of
              traditional leaders in local government. Inkosi Mzimela
              expressed the deep disappointment of the House in the
              government's failure to meet the demands of traditional
              leaders. He stressed the need for constitutional amendments,
              not just new legislation, to meet the concerns of traditional
              leaders.


         2. The House held capacity-building workshops, participated in the
              Vodacom Foundation rural development and BMW social
              programmes, and has become more active in the HIV/AIDS
              campaign.


         3. The chairperson and deputy chairperson of the House have become
              full-time members as from 1 April this year.


         4. The Committee feels that the House should continue its
              negotiations with the government on its concerns about the
              powers and functions of traditional leaders in local
              government. The Committee will also give attention to the
              concerns of traditional leaders once the pending Bill is
              introduced in Parliament.


         5. The Committee feels that the report submitted by the House is
              not adequate. It is difficult for the Committee to evaluate
              how the money allocated to the House during the past financial
              year was spent and what the House plans to do with the money
              allocated to it for this financial year. As the Department
              takes responsibility for the budget of the House, the
              Committee requests it to assist the House to provide an
              appropriate report to Parliament next year. The Committee will
              organise a meeting with the House within six months to discuss
              matters of common concern.
     N.     Municipal Demarcation Board


         1. The Board functions with one full-time and eight part-time
              members. Its budget has been reduced from R24,8 million to
              R12,2 million and will continue to decrease over the next two
              years.


         2. With the initial redemarcation of boundaries completed, the
              Board's main work includes recommendations to the Minister and
              MECs on authorisation of powers and functions; assessments of
              the capacity of municipalities to exercise powers and
              functions; the alignment of functional service boundaries with
              municipal boundaries; policy work on "aspirant metros"; a
              review of municipal and ward boundaries where necessary; and
              to further develop a local government data base.


         3. The Committee congratulates the Board on the way it has
              fulfilled its functions, especially in view of the constraints
              of time and resources within which it operated. The Board is
              particularly commended for its very productive use of its
              limited resources.


     O.     Local Government Water and Related Services SETA


         1. This SETA replaces the Local Government Education and Training
              Board. It was established on 20 March 2000 by the Minister of
              Labour in terms of the Skills Development Act. The last year
              was spent establishing structures, appointing staff and
              developing policies.


         2. The SETA has identified both short-term and long-term strategic
              priorities, developed sector skills business plans, workplace
              skills plans and appointed skills development facilitators.


         3. As at 31 December 2000, 7 600 people had participated in its
              training sessions. About 77% of them had successfully
              completed the programmes. SETA evaluates programmes of other
              organisations offering training, including SALGA. The SETA is
              also compiling a database of consultants and trainers for
              municipalities.


         4. The SETA is responsible for two pilot projects - the R4 million
              DANIDA (Danish Government) financial management learnership
              project and the Norwegian government-funded R10 million
              "Project Viability" financial management project.


         5. By December 2000 the SETA had spent R9,6 million of the
              Norwegian funds. The R9 million that was allocated by the
              Department to the Training Board during the 1999-2000
              financial year, will be utilised during this financial year.


         6. The Committee recognises that the SETA has just been
              established and has had to face many challenges. The Committee
              feels, however, that capacity-building and training are
              crucial to the success of the new system of local government
              and that the SETA has a more important role to play than ever.
              The Committee feels that there should be greater co-ordination
              and integration of the capacity-building and training
              programmes of the different organisations which provide these
              programmes within the local government sphere.


              The report submitted by the SETA to Parliament is difficult to
              evaluate, especially in terms of "value-for- money" criteria.
              The Committee expects a more appropriate report from the SETA
              next year, consistent with the requirements of the PFMA. The
              Committee will also organise a meeting with the SETA and hold
              a special briefing on training and capacity-building in local
              government with a range of relevant stakeholders within the
              next six months.


     P.     Municipal Infrastructure Investment Unit (MIIU)


         1. The MIIU was established in 1997 for a five-year term to
              "optimise private sector investment in local authority
              services, on a basis that is sustainable for both local
              authorities and at national level". The MIIU has to "assist
              the development of an established market containing informed
              local authority clients, private sector advisers, and private
              sector investors and services providers".


         2. The service sectors within which MIIU operates, are primarily
              essential services such as water, sanitation and solid waste.
              Other sectors include transport, power generation and
              distribution, and information technology.
         3. MIIU offers technical and financial assistance to
              municipalities. This usually involves engaging consultants to
              assess the feasibility of various municipal service
              partnerships. MIIU usually shares the cost of the work with
              the municipality.


         4. MIIU has developed a comprehensive three-year strategy and
              seeks to be more active in the local government transformation
              process.


         5. MIIU is funded through the national fiscus, donor community,
              and income from interest. It receives R6 million from the
              national budget, and its income from all sources for this
              financial year will be R10,6 million.


         6. The Committee welcomes the continuation of MIIU beyond its
              original five-year mandate and is interested in its three-year
              strategy. The Committee would like to respond more fully to
              MIIU's work and will seek another opportunity to do so. The
              Committee would like to see the work of MIIU located more
              firmly within the context of the overall local government
              transformation. While MIIU is primarily concerned with drawing
              in the private sector, it might also be useful for it to have
              a better sense of public/public and other partnerships as
              well.
              The Committee would like to organise a meeting on municipal
              service partnerships with a range of stakeholders, including
              MIIU, fairly soon. The tentative proposal is late June this
              year.


     Q.     Conclusion


         1. It is clear that one-off annual budget hearings are not
              adequate to properly evaluate how budgets are being used. The
              PFMA provides the framework for a much more rigorous scrutiny
              of the spending of public money. The Committee has to explore
              ways of taking the issues raised in the budget hearings
              further through more regular exchanges with the Department and
              statutory bodies which fall within its portfolio.


         2. The Committee needs to enhance its capacity to scrutinise
              budgets. It also needs technical support. Negotiations are
              under way to secure the services of a researcher for the
              Committee. The Committee would like, however, to acknowledge
              the assistance of Ms D Hene in the preparation of this Report.


         3. The Committee should seek to send representatives to the
              hearings of the Portfolio Committee on Finance on the Division
              of Revenue Bill.


         4. The reports from some of the statutory bodies were not
              satisfactory. The Committee will consult with the Department
              and other relevant parties on what can be done to improve the
              quality of reporting to Parliament with regard to the budget.


         5. Overall, the Committee feels that the budget hearings were much
              more focused and productive this year than in previous years,
              but there is still a lot of room for improvement.


         6. The Committee wishes to express its appreciation to the
              Minister, the Department and statutory bodies for their
              participation in the hearings.
