                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Dr P J C NEL: Madam Chair, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting  I
shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that an ethics audit recently conducted by the Ethics Institute
       of South Africa, an  independent  organisation,  at  the  Chris  Hani
       Baragwanath Hospital showed inter alia that -


       (a)  because of chronic staff shortage and  bad  working  conditions,
           the hospital was delivering a substandard health care service;


       (b)  the hospital with its dilapidated infrastructure was an  unsafe,
           dirty and depressing workplace;


       (c)  staff morale was low and  they  felt  they  were  working  in  a
           ``second-class'' hospital;


       (d)  a large percentage of patients had to bribe  staff  for  special
           treatment; and


       (e)  there was a severe shortage of pharmaceutical products and linen
           due to theft;


  (2) in general takes note that one of the largest hospitals in the  world
       with a bed capacity of 3 400 and employing 4 885 people is critically
       ill and is dying; and


  (3) requests the Minister of Health to put this hospital in an  intensive
       care unit where it can  get  highly  specialised  treatment,  without
       delay.

Mr K D S DURR: Madam Chair, at the next  sitting  of  this  Council  I  will
move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a conflict  resolution  conference  on  the  Sudan,  called  the
           Southern Political Forces  Conference,  is  to  be  held  (after
           Nigerian facilitation) in Abuja, Nigeria from 12 to 17 November,
           under chairmanship of former President Ibrahim Babangia;
       (b)  participants will include SPLM armed  factions,  Southerners  in
           government, civilian  political  parties,  plus  a  geographical
           representation, prominent women and national figures; and


       (c)  the outcome could be  a  common  Southern  position  and  agreed
           preconditions for peace as well as the establishment of a common
           Southern forum, as a precursor to negotiations for peace, to end
           the protracted violence and political stalemate in the Sudan;


  (2) calls upon the South African Government to encourage the  process  in
       Abuja and beyond; and


  (3) hopes that a common position can be found by the conference  so  that
       the process of negotiation and constitution-making in the  Sudan  can
       commence that can lead to a settlement and an end to violence in that
       troubled country.
Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the attempts by Premier Gerald Morkel to delay the collapse  of
       the DA by -


       (a)  calling a provincial meeting of the Western Cape; and


       (b)  legal attempts to halt the emergency meeting  of  the  New  NP's
           Federal Council;


  (2) further notes that such actions by the premier -


       (a)  are symbolic of a selfish agenda based  on  self-aggrandisement;
           and


       (b)  reflect the short-sightedness and lack of  political  acumen  of
           the premier by continuing an alliance based purely on  an  anti-
           ANC platform and a regurgitation of ``white politics'' based  on
           exclusive privileges; and


  (3) resolves that -


       (a)  more emphasis be placed on  advancing  the  national  agenda  of
           building nonracialism, reconciliation and nation-building; and


       (b)  more emphasis  be  placed  on  aligning  with  forces  that  are
           consistent with values that will advance all the people of South
           Africa.

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern comments attributed to the honourable Mr Tony Leon
       in the Cape Times in which  he  is  quoted  as  saying  that  if  the
       ``Doomed-to-fail Alliance'' loses the Western Cape, the ANC will turn
       the province into a replica of other provinces;


  (2) believes that the statement by Mr Leon is one of  his  many  attempts
       since the early days of apartheid, when he was the  propagandist  for
       the former SADF, to demonise the ANC;


  (3)  further  believes  that  Mr  Leon's  outburst  shows   a   lack   of
       understanding of political realignment; and


  (4) therefore calls upon Mr Leon to stop puerile and hollow lamenting and
       allow the process of political realignment to take its course.

Me C-S BOTHA: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek tydens  die  volgende
sitting sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die ondubbelsinnige verklaring oor die Nuwe  NP  deur
       twee woordvoerders van Cosatu,  lid  van  die  drieledige  alliansie,
       naamlik dat - in hul woorde - ``die Nuwe NP -


       (a)  'n voortsetting is van die ou NP wat Suid-Afrika  aan  apartheid
           onderwerp het; en wat nou


       (b)  op opportunistiese wyse probeer om hulself te  reposisioneer  as
           'n `progressiewe mag' deur beginsellose alliansies  te  sluit'';
           en


   (2)      van mening is dat die kiesers van Suid-Afrika nie onderskat moet
       word deur te dink dat hulle vir hierdie siniese foefie sal val nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1)  notes  the  unambiguous  statement  regarding  the  New  NP  by  two
       spokespersons for Cosatu, a member of the tripartite alliance, namely
       that - in their words - "the New NP is -


       (a)  a continuation of the old NP  that  subjected  South  Africa  to
           apartheid; and which is now


       (b)  trying in an opportunistic manner  to  reposition  itself  as  a
           `progressive force', by forging unprincipled alliances"; and


  (2) is of the opinion that the electorate of South Africa should  not  be
       underestimated by thinking that  they  will  fall  for  this  cynical
       gimmick.]

   CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR OF THE YEAR AWARD AWARDED TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE
                        RESERVE BANK, MR TITO MBOWENI

                             (Draft Resolution)

Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with great pride the honour of Central  Bank  Governor  of  the
       Year Award that has just  been  conferred  on  the  Governor  of  the
       Reserve Bank, Mr  Tito  Mboweni,  by  the  internationally  acclaimed
       Euromoney Journal;


  (2) shares in the  admiration  and  recognition  of  Mr  Mboweni  by  his
       international peers, considering that he is only in his  second  year
       in that position;


  (3) believes that South Africa's low inflation rate, sound interest  rate
       and monetary policy is further testimony to this; and


  (4) also  notes  that  this  achievement  will  go  a  long  way  towards
       reinforcing foreign investor belief in South Africa.

HON MEMBERS: Hear, hear!

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        ATTACKS BY UNITA ON CIVILIANS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the continued attacks  on  innocent  civilians  in
       Angola by Unita;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  these attacks by Unita are tantamount to terrorist actions; and


       (b)  all actions against terrorism should be treated in the same way;
           and
  (3) calls upon the international  community  to  address  the  plight  of
       Angolans.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

           SOUTH AFRICAN LEGION AND COMMEMORATION OF WAR VETERANS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr J L THERON: Voorsitter, ek stel voor sonder kennisgewing:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) erkenning verleen aan die inisiatiewe van die Suid-Afrikaanse Legioen
       - 'n organisasie  wat  na  die  belange  van  alle  veterane  en  hul
       afhanklikes omsien, ongeag die missie waarvoor  geveg  is  -  om  die
       gestorwenes van alle oorloë te gedenk;


  (2) erkenning verleen aan die feit dat hierdie inisiatief gevolg word  in
       alle Gemenebes-lande, waarvan Suid-Afrika 'n lid is,  en  baie  ander
       lande van die wêreld; en


  (3) besluit om ondersteuning te verleen aan die idee dat  enigiemand  wat
       enigsins  kan,  op  die  elfde  dag  (Sondag)  van  die  elfde  maand
       (November) om 11:00 twee minute stilte handhaaf om  alle  gestorwenes
       in oorloë te gedenk.

Voorsitter, dit is waarvoor  hierdie  papawer  ook  staan.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1)  recognises  the  initiatives  of  the  South  African  Legion  -  an
       organisation which looks after the interests of all military veterans
       and their dependants, irrespective of the cause they fought for -  to
       honour the fallen in all wars;


  (2)  acknowledges  that  this  initiative  is  being  followed   by   all
       Commonwealth countries, of which South Africa is a member, as well as
       many other countries of the world; and


  (3) resolves to support the idea that those who are able to do  so,  will
       on the eleventh day (Sunday) of  the  eleventh  month  (November)  at
       11:00 observe two minutes of silence to  honour  the  fallen  in  all
       wars.

Chairperson, that is also what this poppy stands for.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to the motion?

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Yes, Chairperson.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Order!  There  is  an  objection.  The  motion
therefore becomes notice of a motion.

  COMMENTS BY AUDITOR-GENERAL REGARDING POOR IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGISLATION
                     AND POLICY AND UNSPENT ALLOCATIONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Voorsitter, ek stel voor sonder kennisgewing:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) met ontsteltenis kennis neem van die Ouditeur-Generaal  se  bevinding
       dat 'n gebrekkige vermoë om wetgewing en regeringsbeleid doeltreffend
       en ekonomies in werking te stel een van die brandendste probleme  van
       owerheidstrukture in Suid-Afrika bly en dat dit  aan  'n  tekort  aan
       kundigheid op bedryfs- en bestuursvlak te wyte is; en


  (2) met kommer kennis neem dat die Ouditeur-Generaal  verder  bevind  het
       dat   onbestede   toewysings   aan   departemente,   provinsies    en
       munisipaliteite 'n stygende tendens toon.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with dismay the finding of  the  Auditor-General  that  a  poor
       ability to implement legislation and  government  policy  efficiently
       and economically  remains  one  of  the  most  pressing  problems  of
       structures of authority in South Africa and that it  results  from  a
       shortage of expertise at operating and management level; and


  (2) notes with concern that the Auditor-General also found  that  unspent
       allocations to departments,  provinces  and  municipalities  show  an
       increasing trend.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection  to  the  motion?
[Interjections.] There is an objection. The motion therefore becomes  notice
of a motion.

                ALLEGED LEAKAGE OF EXAM PAPERS IN MPUMALANGA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the motion without notice adopted on 6  November  2001  on
       the leakage of exam papers wrongly refers to Mpumalanga as one of the
       provinces where the leakage occurred; and


  (2) amends paragraph 1 by the deletion of ``Mpumalanga''.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to  that  motion?
[Interjections.] There is an objection. The motion therefore becomes  notice
of a motion.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel voor sonder kennisgewing:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  'n uitgelese groep akademici onder die naam die  Vrydaggroep  'n
           verslag oor taalverskeidenheid in Suid-Afrika  sedert  1994  die
           lig laat sien het;


       (b)  hierdie verslag  dit  duidelik  stel  dat  Engels  deurgaans  bo
           Afrikaans en die  ander  inheemse  tale  in  owerheidsinstansies
           gestel word;
       (c)  volgens die Voorsitter van die groep,  prof  Van  Rensburg,  die
           getal  eksemplare  van  boeke  en  regeringsdokumente   wat   in
           Afrikaans, isiZulu en Sepedi  gedruk  is  tussen  1994  en  1999
           afgeneem het teenoor die skerp styging in Engelse eksemplare; en


       (d)  prof Van Rensburg ook daarop wys dat, op SABC 1, 2 en 3,  Engels
           74% van die  uitsaaityd  kry  teenoor  Afrikaans  se  8,9%,  die
           Ngunitale se 4,7% en die Sotho-groep se 3,5%;


  (2) die aanbeveling steun dat  die  Suid-Afrikaanse  Talewet  so  spoedig
       moontlik aangebied en aanvaar word; en


  (3) verder kennis neem dat agbare lede dié verslag by mnr A E van Niekerk
       kan bekom.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That the Council -


     (1)    notes that


         (a)     a select group of academics  named  the  Friday  Group  has
              published a report on language diversity in South Africa since
              1994;


         (b)     this  report  states  clearly  that  throughout  government
              institutions  English  is  continuously  being  placed   above
              Afrikaans and the other indigenous languages;


         (c)     according  to  the  chairperson  of  the  group,  Prof  Van
              Rensburg,  the  number  of  copies  of  books  and  government
              documents printed in Afrikaans, isiZulu and  Sepedi  decreased
              between 1994 and 1999, in contrast with the sharp increase  in
              English copies; and


         (d)     Prof Van Rensburg also points out that English on  SABC  1,
              2 and 3 receives 74% of the  broadcasting  time,  in  contrast
              with the 8,9% of Afrikaans, the 4,7% of  Nguni  languages  and
              the 3,5% of the Sotho group;


     (2)    supports  the  recommendation  that  the  legislation  on  South
         African languages be tabled and passed as soon as possible;


     (3)    further notes that honourable members  can  obtain  this  report
         from Mr A E van Niekerk.]

(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows)

[Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


     (1)    notes that -


         (a)     a Cape Town yacht manufactured by Voyage Yachts in  Paarden
              Eiland has been selected as the best in the world;

                       POOR COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


   (1)      notes with great concern the  newspaper  report  that  community
        service doctors put patients at risk in the rural areas;


   (2)      further notes that these doctors, besides  being  insufficiently
        trained  in  community  health  work,   are   undersupervised   and
        overworked;


   (3)      acknowledges the South African Medical Journal for publishing  a
        list of misdiagnosed  cases  as  an  attempt  to  conscientise  the
        Department of Health around this problem;


   (4)      believes that community health sectors in rural areas are  still
        faced with  the  problems  of  poor  infrastructure,  inappropriate
        staffing, lack of  adequate  ambulance  services  and  shortage  of
        medication; and


  (5) therefore appeals  to  the  Department  of  Health  to  play  a  more
        effective role in investigating these allegations and to  establish
        systems for monitoring the  community  health  services  to  ensure
        quality care to patients.


The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to that motion?

Mr A E VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  I  have  an  amendment.  I  move  as  an
amendment:


  That, in paragraph (1), ``some'' be inserted before  ``community  service
  doctors''.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I do not object to  the  amendment,  because,
after all, this reflects on only some community  service  doctors,  who  are
still in training.

Amendment agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Motion, as  amended,  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the
Constitution, namely:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with great concern the newspaper  report  that  some  community
       service doctors put patients at risk in the rural areas;


  (2) further  notes  that  these  doctors,  besides  being  insufficiently
       trained in community health work, are undersupervised and overworked;


  (3) acknowledges the South African Medical Journal for publishing a  list
       of misdiagnosed cases as an attempt to conscientise the Department of
       Health around this problem;


  (4) believes that community health sectors in rural areas are still faced
       with the problems of  poor  infrastructure,  inappropriate  staffing,
       lack of adequate ambulance services and shortage of medication; and

       effective role in investigating these allegations  and  to  establish
       systems for  monitoring  the  community  health  services  to  ensure
       quality care to patients.

             REPORT COMMISSIONED BY GAUTENG DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) commends the Gauteng Department of Health for having commissioned  an
       audit which among others  provided  valuable  information  about  the
       situation at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital; and


  (2) notes that the report of the audit and the  information  so  gathered
       will help the Department to take steps to rectify the  situation  and
       help plan for the future.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! We will have to look at the  wording  of
that motion in order to ensure that it is not the same  in  content  as  the
motion adopted a moment ago. We will study the record in that regard.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

           JUDGES' REMUNERATION AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The  DEPUTY   MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson, colleagues, comrades and friends, this  Bill  emanates  largely
from the amendments to  the  Constitution  that  were  recently  enacted  in
Parliament, more specifically the amendments that seek to  extend  the  term
of  office  of  Constitutional  Court  judges  in   certain   circumstances.
Furthermore, they envisage the head of  the  Constitutional  Court  becoming
the Chief Justice, and the  Supreme  Court  of  Appeal  being  headed  by  a
president.  The  opportunity  has  also  been  used   to   rationalise   the
legislation,  regulating  remunerations  and  conditions  of  employment  of
judges by making this legislation applicable countrywide.

The Judges' Remuneration  and  Conditions  of  Employment  Bill,  2001,  was
originally tabled in Parliament as the  Judicial  Officers  Amendment  Bill.
The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional  Development  decided,
for a variety of reasons, to deal only with those  provisions  contained  in
the Bill pertaining to the remuneration of judges and  their  conditions  of
employment. They essentially focused on  matters  that  cannot  be  held  in
abeyance until the 2002 session of Parliament.

Although the provisions under discussion differ somewhat from  the  Bill  as
introduced, deliberations  by  the  portfolio  and  select  committees  have
resulted in a soundly crafted piece of legislation. The end product in  this
legislative process is also a fine example of how  constructive  debate  and
engagement at the committee level in Parliament enhances the real  value  of
our constitutional democracy.

The Bill, as originally  tabled,  proposed  that  the  Constitutional  Court
judges enjoy life tenure, as do their colleagues in  the  Supreme  Court  of
Appeal and in the High Courts. There was strong opposition to this  proposal
from various quarters, and the debate that  ensued  in  the  committees  was
rigorous and probing.

At one point, quite frankly, I was not optimistic that a  workable  solution
could be found. But the committee's usual  thoroughness  and  thoughtfulness
prevailed. I am pleased to say that the Bill debated  by  this  House  today
fully addresses the Ministry's original concerns about the current  position
of Constitutional Court judges, and responds more  than  adequately  to  our
motives for proposing life tenure in the first place.

Hon members will recall that the protagonists for life  tenure  argued  that
this would be in the best interests  of  the  Constitutional  Court,  as  an
institution. Antagonists, on the other hand, argued that the  Constitutional
Court with all its powers was, from the  outset,  intended  to  be  presided
over by judges with limited or fixed tenure of office,  in  a  court  almost
set apart from the other ordinary courts of the land. The Bill, in my  view,
now satisfies both these arguments.

Let us have a look at some of the key provisions provided by  this  reworked
piece of legislation. Before doing that, we need to have  a  quick  look  at
the current position.

In terms of the current legislation, a judge is a judge for  life  and  does
not retire. A judge must be discharged from active service  at  the  age  of
70, but can stay on until the age  of  75  years,  if  he  or  she  has  not
completed 15 years' active service, 15 years being the number  of  years  to
qualify for a full pension.

After discharge from active service, a judge continues to get a  salary  for
life, a salary that is calculated using a formula that  takes  into  account
the salary of a judge at discharge from active service  and  the  number  of
years of active service.

In addition to this lifelong salary, judges also  receive  a  gratuity  when
they are discharged from active service. This gratuity is also based on  the
salary of a judge at discharge from active service and the number  of  years
of active service. Surviving spouses of judges are entitled to  a  share  of
this retirement salary and gratuity in the event of the death of the  judge.


In contrast to this, Constitutional Court judges who were not judges  before
they  were  appointed  to  the  Constitutional  Court,  receive  a  once-off
gratuity when their term of office in the Constitutional Court comes  to  an
end; either when they turn 70 or when their nonrenewable 12-year term  as  a
Constitutional Court judge expires. Should any of these  judges  die,  their
surviving spouses are also entitled to a share of this gratuity.

The portfolio and select committees have designed a new statute that  brings
into line the remuneration  and  conditions  of  employment  of  judges  and
Constitutional Court judges. They now  enjoy  similar  benefits  for  active
service and other benefits after discharge from active service.

The crux of this new arrangement is to be found in the new clauses 3  and  4
of the  Bill,  and  these  deal  with  discharge  from  active  service  and
continuation of active service in certain circumstances. Clause  3  confirms
the constitutionally entrenched principle that Constitutional  Court  judges
leave the Constitutional Court on attaining the age of 70  years,  or  after
completing a nonrenewable 12-year term of office.

Clause  4,  however,  following  the  scheme  of  the  existing  legislation
pertaining to other judges, allows Constitutional Court  judges,  whose  12-
year term of service has come to an end  but  who  do  not  have  15  years'
active service, to stay on in the Constitutional Court until  they  have  15
years'  active  service  for  pension  purposes,  whereupon  they  must   be
discharged from active service.

Clause 4 also allows a Constitutional Court judge to stay on in  that  court
after attaining the age  of  70  in  order  to  complete  15  years'  active
service. Like ordinary judges, Constitutional Court judges will not be  able
to stay on in that court after the age of 75.

Another two aspects about which I am very  pleased  are  also  contained  in
clause 4. This clause specifically  provides  that  a  Constitutional  Court
judge, who is discharged from active service in  the  Constitutional  Court,
can go back to either the Supreme Court of Appeal or to the  High  Court  if
he or she was a judge in one of those courts before being appointed  to  the
Constitutional Court. This provision is  only  valid  if  that  judge  still
qualifies to hold office as a judge in a permanent capacity.

Clause 4 also pertinently states that  nothing  precludes  a  Constitutional
Court judge, who was not a judge before being appointed to that court,  from
being appointed to the Supreme Court of Appeal or  to  a  High  Court.  But,
again, this provision only holds if he  or  she  still  qualifies  for  such
permanent appointment. Continuation in office as a judge  in  another  court
does however not entitle such a judge to a salary  as  a  serving  judge  as
well as to a salary which is payable after discharge from active service  as
a Constitutional Court judge. Only one salary will be payable  and  that  is
the salary of a serving judge.

I note that the provisions dealing with the  performance  of  service  after
discharge from active service have been adapted slightly in the  sense  that
judges, who are required to perform service  in  a  court,  will  receive  a
salary which is payable to the holder of the office in which  such  a  judge
serves. The remuneration in respect of all  other  voluntary  service  by  a
judge after  discharge  from  active  service  will  be  determined  by  the
President, most probably in consultation with the judge in question.

I also note that the performance of  service  after  discharge  from  active
service will be more closely monitored by the Judicial Services  Commission.


As I have already mentioned, this legislation will happily apply  throughout
the country. We are now  in  a  position  to  discard  some  of  the  former
homeland legislation, a rather sad reminder of  our  woeful  past  in  which
South  Africa  was  split  and  divided  into  numerous  highly   artificial
entities. The  repeal  of  this  legislation  has  required  some  elaborate
transitional provisions in order to ensure that all judges and  the  service
they have performed are captured within the scope of the legislation.

Before concluding, I  want  to  repeat  that  the  issues  in  the  Judicial
Officers Amendment Bill not dealt with now will stand over until next  year.
Should any unintended consequences arise from this legislation,  there  will
be ample opportunity to address these issues when we return next year.

The Minister and I are indebted to both the portfolio and select  committees
for their dedication and enterprise in accommodating the varied and  sharply
contested arguments that surrounded this legislation. They have  produced  a
Bill that serves the long-term interests  of  the  Constitutional  Court  in
that aspirants seeking to serve in  this  high  office  will  no  longer  be
discouraged   by   an   unfavourable   and   comparatively   disadvantageous
remuneration package.

In seeking to  eliminate  this  barrier,  the  committees  have  provided  a
solution that also addresses the concerns of those who were concerned  about
compromising the principle of a fixed term for Constitutional Court  judges.


My thanks must go to the officials of the department who have  assisted  the
committee responsible for guiding this legislation through Parliament.  Here
I would like to  make  special  mention  of  Mr  Lawrence  Basset,  who  has
championed this Bill on the department's behalf.

I rise in support of this Bill. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, it gives me such  a  wonderful  feeling  to
rise in support of this Bill.

We see it as a further necessary  and  desirable  step  in  the  process  of
simplifying the administration  of  justice,  following  the  constitutional
amendments dealing with the offices of the Chief  Justice  of  South  Africa
and the Deputy Chief Justice, and those of  the  President  and  the  Deputy
President of the Supreme Court of Appeal, as well as the term of  office  of
Constitutional Court judges.

This Bill emanates from the Judicial Officers  Amendment  Bill.  Because  of
the complexity of issues and time constraints in  dealing  with  that  Bill,
both committees, that is, the portfolio committee and the select  committee,
decided that  the  Judicial  Officers  Amendment  Bill  should  be  held  in
abeyance until the 2002 session of Parliament. The committee also felt  that
it should present its own Bill in terms  of  the  Rules  of  Parliament,  in
order  to  deal  with  only  those  urgent  matters  pertaining  to  judges'
remuneration and conditions of employment which could not  be  put  on  hold
until next year.

We attach significance and value to our judges, and this  Bill  is  confined
to amending the Judges' Remuneration and Conditions of Employment  Act,  Act
88 of 1989, and the  corresponding  legislation  of  the  former  homelands,
which is still applicable in those  geographical  areas.  In  essence,  this
Bill amends the principal Act so as to bring it in line with  constitutional
amendments to the effect that the head and deputy of the  Supreme  Court  of
Appeal will become the President and Deputy President of the  Supreme  Court
of Appeal, respectively.

This Bill also extends the benefits  of  judges  of  the  Supreme  Court  of
Appeal and High Courts to Constitutional Court judges,  which  includes  the
extension of their terms of office in certain circumstances.

The Bill also provides that judges or their widows who receive  pensions  in
terms of the Judges' Pensions Act, Act  90  of  1979,  which  regulated  the
retirement dispensation of  judges  before  the  enactment  of  the  Judges'
Remuneration and Conditions of  Employment  Act  of  1989,  will  in  future
receive pensions which are  coupled  to  the  salaries  of  judges  who  are
discharged from active service. This is necessary because  the  pensions  of
retired judges or the widows of judges who fall in this category  are  based
on a formula which does not counter the effects of inflation. I  would  like
to inform members that the inclusion of 7 June 1994 in the definition  means
that, with regard to  Judge  President  Chaskalson,  for  example,  who  was
appointed to this current position on that date, it removes doubt as to  the
precise meaning of his term and that of other judges of  the  Constitutional
Court who were appointed thereafter.

In order to accommodate judges from the former TBVC states,  the  definition
of ``judge'' has been amended in such a way that it  includes  those  judges
who held office since the fixed date, and in this way all judicial  officers
will effectively be covered by the definition in this Bill.

I would like  to  associate  myself  with  the  sentiments  that  are  being
expressed in congratulating the team of people  who  have  been  responsible
for this work. In order to get to the  promised  land,  one  must  negotiate
through the wilderness.

In conclusion, I would like to point out that both the Constitution  of  the
Republic of South Africa Amendment Bill, 2001, and the Judges'  Remuneration
and Conditions  of  Employment  Bill,  2001,  do  not  contain  commencement
provisions, therefore it is consequently imperative to enact both pieces  of
legislation before 20 November 2001, since some of the  provisions  of  this
Bill emanate from the said constitutional amendments.

To the select committee members, I might not have suitable  words  to  thank
them for their untiring efforts. They really have been like a steam  kettle:
though up to its neck in hot water, it continues to sing, and no matter  how
deep the bottle is, the cream will always be on top.  Let  us  support  this
Bill.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, listening to the hon the Deputy Minister, I  have
to respectfully agree with her. All parties made a contribution  to  solving
what seemed at one stage an intractable and insoluble problem that  we  had.
But I have another problem. Listening  to  the  hon  the  Deputy  Minister's
speech, I sort of read my speech coming out into the debate  already  and  I
do not wish to bore the House by making it to listen  to  the  same  content
four or five times.

I thought I had picked up two  points  that  the  Deputy  Minister  had  not
mentioned in her speech, but, to my disappointment, the hon  Kgoshi  Mokoena
mentioned  both  of  those  items.  [Laughter.]  [Interjections.]   We   are
basically in a very thorough committee, I must say. We have dealt  with  the
problem and I must say I also sat in  on  some  sessions  of  the  portfolio
committee. I watched the participatory governance being carried out in  real
life in  a  very  effective  way.  We  saw  representatives  of  the  judges
presenting their feelings and arguments in the portfolio committee;  we  saw
representatives of the  legal  profession  doing  the  same  and  interested
citizens made submissions either in writing or in person.

I can only say that at the end of this we will have a product that  we  will
all be proud of. I know that my party supports this and I  do  not  wish  to
labour the point any further.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I definitely have one point that I want  to
add that I have not heard yet, and it is just a technical provision  in  the
Bill relating to the decision universally supported in the legal  fraternity
and judicial circles that the President of the Constitutional  Court  should
be the Chief Justice.

We support that and trust that the incumbent Judge Chaskalson  will  now  be
in a  position  to  fill  the  post  of  Chief  Justice,  because  of  these
achievements, in spite of reaching the old mandatory retirement  age  of  70
at the end of November. We support his appointment as chief justice;  he  is
without doubt our pre-eminent judge and will do honour to the post. The  New
NP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, allow me to start  by  commending  the  opposition
for the oneness they are  showing  from  this  committee.  We  have  visited
magistrates' offices, police stations, as well as correctional  services  as
a cluster, and we were all at one throughout our visits. So  congratulations
are due, especially to Mr Lever.

In dealing with this Bill, I think it is important, first of all, to  sketch
the context within which this Bill arose. The provisions of  the  Bill  were
initially contained in the  Judicial  Officers  Amendment  Bill,  which  was
submitted after 17 August 2001. As members are aware, this  particular  date
was the deadline for the submission of draft legislation  to  be  considered
during  the  2001  parliamentary  session.  Since  the   Judicial   Officers
Amendment Bill was submitted after this deadline, Parliament could not  deal
with the Bill during the current session.

The Bill however contains a number  of  important  provisions  that  emanate
directly from the Constitution of the Republic  of  South  Africa  Amendment
Bill, such as the conversion of the Constitutional Court into the office  of
the  Chief  Justice  and  the  provisions  regarding  the  remuneration  and
conditions of employment of judges. These  are  important  provisions  which
could not stand over until the 2002 session.

Given  the  importance  of  this  provision  the  portfolio  committee,   in
consultation with the select committee, decided  to  take  these  provisions
out of the Judicial Officers  Amendment  Bill  and  bind  them  into  a  new
statute which could still be considered  during  the  current  parliamentary
session, hence the Judges' Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Bill.

The main objectives of the Bill are the following: to  give  effect  to  the
head of the Constitutional Court becoming the Chief Justice and the head  of
the Supreme Court of Appeal becoming the President of the Court  of  Appeal,
in line with the  constitutional  amendments;  to  include  the  offices  of
Deputy Chief Justice and Deputy President of the Supreme Court of Appeal  in
the legislation relating to the remuneration and  conditions  of  employment
of all judges, as it  is  reflected  in  the  Constitution;  to  extend  the
principles relating to the benefits  of  judges  of  the  Supreme  Court  of
Appeal and  High  Court  to  Constitutional  Court  judges;  to  extend  the
legislation relating to the remuneration of judges to all  judges  in  South
Africa, including those serving  on  the  Bench  of  courts  in  the  former
homelands; and to provide for uniform principles relating to the pension  of
judges.

The remuneration of judges  and  the  improvement  in  their  conditions  of
employment have long been a priority for the South African Government.  This
is because the Government understands and accepts that our courts,  together
with the police, are in the front line  of  the  fight  against  crime.  Our
courts act as the custodians of the fundamental human  rights  enshrined  in
our Constitution and as a defensive wall against  anarchy  and  criminality.
Its officials, therefore, deserve to  be  treated  in  a  manner  that  will
reinforce their  commitment  to  upholding  the  constitutional  rights  and
dignity of all South Africans.

Through this Bill the Government is showing its  sincerity  to  address  the
concerns of judges and its commitment to  bringing  about  equality  between
judicial officers. With these few words, I would like to thank the House.

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam
Chairperson, there seems to be so much agreement on this  that  I  will  not
belabour any point, save to say, to the committee  and  the  individual  hon
members, a very big thank you for their constructive participation  in  this
process.  Some  challenges  are  bigger  than  others  and  this  was  quite
certainly something that  could  have  fallen  on  hard  ground,  and  I  am
grateful to all the members.

Just a small point that I  think  members  must  understand,  is  that  this
legislation forms part  of  the  whole  process  of  rationalising  our  new
unitary process towards making the office of judge  a  unitary  and  unified
office.

Secondly, as a point of interest, I  can  tell  members  our  President  was
sworn in by the President of the Constitutional Court, but he  was  not  the
Chief Justice.

This new arrangement takes that uncertainty away.  The  late  Judge  Mahomed
referred quite often to  it  being  an  uncomfortable  situation,  and  that
protocols were difficult to arrange. There was really this  unease  for  all
of  us,  because  the  institutional  arrangements  were  not   tidy.   This
legislation makes them very neat. My final congratulations and thanks go  to
the committee for their support. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

         INTERIM RATIONALISATION OF JURISDICTION OF HIGH COURTS BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, our  history  has  left  us  with  the  anomalous
situation where generally the areas of  jurisdiction  of  our  various  High
Courts  do  not  match  the   geographical   boundaries   of   our   present
constitutional dispensation.

The Constitution envisages a  rationalisation  of  the  judicial  system  in
order to establish a system suited to its requirements. Not  only  does  the
new Constitution create new  provinces,  some  of  which  do  not  have  the
facility of a High Court, but it also incorporates areas that form  part  of
the so-called homelands, most of which  did  have  their  own  High  Courts.
These courts kept  their  historic  areas  of  jurisdiction  under  the  new
Constitution.

This left the country with a situation  in  which  certain  court  resources
were being underutilised, whilst other courts  were  being  overstressed  by
the workloads. There were also other anomalous situations  in  which  people
may have lived a relatively short distance from a High Court, but be  forced
to travel a great  distance  to  another  High  Court  simply  because  they
happened to live on the other side of what is now an irrelevant line on  the
map.

The hardships caused by this problem can be illustrated by  situations  that
I encountered in my practice. I was consulted to bring  an  application  for
an urgent interdict where the applicants lived on one side of  the  national
road, and some of the respondents lived on  the  same  side  of  that  road,
whilst other respondents happened to live on the other  side  of  the  road.
Due  to  this  fact,  it  would  have  necessitated  a  simultaneous  urgent
application in two different High Courts more  that  300  kilometres  apart.
This was beyond the means of the applicants,  and  I  have  always  believed
that they were denied access to justice because of this Act.

A commission of inquiry was set up to investigate how  to  rationalise  this
system in order to reflect the requirements of the  new  Constitution.  This
commission recommended a High Court in each of the nine provinces.  It  will
take a considerable period of time to rationalise  the  judicial  system  in
line with this commission's recommendations.

The Interim Rationalisation of Jurisdiction of High Courts Bill is  designed
to provide more immediate relief. If the Minister determines  that  altering
the area of jurisdiction of a High Court will  promote  the  efficiency  of,
and equity relating  to,  the  administration  of  justice,  he  may,  after
consultation with the Judicial Service Commission, and  after  it  has  been
approved by Parliament, alter the area of such jurisdiction by publishing  a
notice to that effect in the Gazette.

This will not affect proceedings already instituted  at  the  time  of  such
publication, although with an appropriate application  with  notice  to  all
parties concerned, such action may be transferred to another High  Court  if
it appears that such action should have been instituted in that  other  High
Court or if the court finds that it would be more convenient or  appropriate
that the action be heard in another High Court.

This Bill also enjoys the unanimous support of all  parties  represented  on
the committee, and we accordingly  recommend  that  this  House  adopts  it.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with Section 75 of the Constitution.

                       JUDICIAL MATTERS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, this  Bill  amends  a  number  of  different  and
diverse Acts that  fall  within  the  Justice  cluster.  It  starts  off  by
amending the 1929 Administration Amendment  Act,  to  allow  divorce  courts
established in terms of that Act to deal with matters  arising  out  of  the
recognition of Customary Marriages Act, 1998.

This Bill then amends the Cross-Border Insolvency Act of  2000,  to  provide
that the court may refuse a sequestration order when  it  appears  equitable
or convenient that the estate of a person domiciled in a state that has  not
been designated in terms of  the  Cross-Border  Insolvency  Act,  should  be
sequestrated elsewhere.

It also amends section 19 of the Extradition Act,  to  provide  for  a  case
where a person is surrendered to the Republic by a  designated  country  and
not in terms of an extradition agreement. It will also amend sections 3  and
9 of the South African Law Commission Act, to bring this Act into line  with
the structure of the courts established in terms of the new Constitution.
Members of this House may recall that a  few  weeks  ago  we  dealt  with  a
Correctional Services Amendment Bill which, in  essence,  provided  for  the
relevant Minister,  in  consultation  with  the  Minister  for  Justice  and
Constitutional Development,  to  authorise  the  release  of  awaiting-trial
prisoners who had been granted bail but could not afford to pay  such  bail,
where prison conditions had become seriously overcrowded.

The amendment proposed  in  this  Bill  has  a  similar  purpose.  The  main
difference between the two procedures proposed is  that,  in  terms  of  the
present Bill, the head of the prison concerned must apply  to  the  relevant
court to amend the bail conditions or release  the  accused  on  warning  in
lieu  of  bail,  as  opposed  to  the  Minister  of  Correctional   Services
exercising a discretion in the matter.

It seems that the procedure set out in the Correctional  Services  Amendment
Act will not be implemented, and the situation of  overcrowding  in  respect
of awaiting-trial prisoners will be dealt with in  terms  of  the  procedure
set out in  this  Bill.  The  procedure  set  out  in  this  Bill  has  more
safeguards built into it, although it  may  take  longer  to  implement  and
relieve the serious problem of overcrowding for awaiting-trial prisoners.

The committee felt that these safeguards were both desirable  and  necessary
in the circumstances. The Bill  also  provides  for  the  appointment  of  a
clinical psychologist in certain incidental matters  related  thereto,  when
the mental capacity of an accused is called into question.

The Bill also provides that the Rules Board for Courts of Law Act, 1995,  is
amended to bring the designation of a member of the judiciary  as  a  member
of the board into line with the court structure,  as  set  out  in  the  new
Constitution.

The Bill makes certain textual amendments  to  the  schedule  of  the  Hague
Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction Act,  1996,  to
bring it into line with article 44 of the  Hague  Convention  on  the  Civil
Aspects of International Child Abduction.

The Bill amends the Maintenance Act, 1998,  to  provide  that  a  person  in
whose favour  a  maintenance  order  has  been  granted  may  apply  to  any
maintenance court in whose area of jurisdiction  he  or  she  may  currently
reside for the enforcement of such an order. In  the  past,  such  a  person
would have been confined to having the order enforced  by  the  court  which
brought the order, regardless of whether or not he or  she  still  lived  in
the area of jurisdiction of the court which originally granted the order.

The Bill also effects  certain  textual  corrections  to  the  Promotion  of
Access to Information Act  of  2000  and  the  Promotion  of  Administrative
Justice Act of 2000.

This Bill enjoys the support of all parties represented on the committee.

Debate concluded.
Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                        DEMOBILISATION AMENDMENT BILL

                   TERMINATION OF INTEGRATION INTAKE BILL

               (Consideration of Bills and of Reports thereon)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE COUNCIL: Order! We are to deal with Orders 4  and  5.
I note that the member of the executive responsible for the Bill is  not  in
the House.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, we understand that the Minister  is
on her way. We have communicated with her office. I do  not  know  what  the
reason for the delay is. May I ask  that  we  adjourn  for  a  short  while.
Alternatively, we could proceed with the debate and  she  could  respond  at
the end of the debate.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I think we  will  proceed.  I  will  ask
Kgoshi Mokoena to introduce the Bill. This is  most  unusual.  I  know  that
programmes are published in time and I am a bit puzzled as to why  we  would
have such a situation.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, what an elevation!  [Laughter.]  There  are
people who put their lives on the line for this country to be free.  Because
of their guard and courage, it is possible for us to be in this  Parliament.
They sacrificed anything one can think of to free this  country.  Some  died
in the course of action. Some could not even get  decent  funerals,  because
of the unbearable situation then. There are  those  who  have  survived  the
onslaught. Who are these people?  I  am  talking  of  none  other  than  our
heroes,  members  of  MK,  Apla  and  other  relevant  forces   of   various
organisations. The said forces  and  those  who  belonged  to  the  previous
government, the then SADF, and the armies of the  TBVC  states,  had  to  be
integrated.

The successful integration of these forces is  a  powerful  illustration  of
our democratic Government's commitment to  nation-building,  reconciliation,
unity and transformation. The main purpose of our  integration  process  was
to establish  a  new  national  defence  force  which  is  characterised  by
professionalism,   effectiveness,   efficiency   and   gender   and   racial
representivity. The integration process  was  never  going  to  be  easy  or
trouble-free,  given  the  political  and  logistical  complexities  of  the
merging forces, which were once sworn  enemies.  Problems  have  cropped  up
from time to time, but they have been dealt with in a constructive manner.

I hope that members are now aware that I am dealing with the Termination  of
Integration Intake Bill. The department had stipulated dates by  which  this
process had to be finalised. The dates had to be  staggered  for  the  third
time to allow those who might have been erroneously omitted to be taken  in.


While it was necessary for the department to make sure  that  everybody  was
on board, there was no way that the process would be open-ended;  there  had
to be a stop somewhere. This Bill now seeks to provide for a date  by  which
this  process  has  to  be  completed,  since  we  are  only  amending  some
provisions of the  principal  Act.  I  am  not  going  to  deal  with  other
logistics which are not relevant to this Bill.

The reason for this Bill serving before this Council is to propose that  the
integration process be completed on or before 31 March 2002. I hope  members
will find this in order. After the integration process, there may  be  those
members of the force who might not be  interested  in  pursuing  a  military
career. There are those who say the mission has been accomplished and  there
are those who want to pursue other lines outside the  Defence  Force.  These
are the groups that want to  be  demobilised.  They  have  applied  for  the
demobilisation gratuity. The department has requested all those who want  to
be demobilised to forward their  applications  within  a  specified  period.
Some of those who did not  qualify  to  be  integrated  because  of  various
reasons  also  applied  for  the   demobilisation   gratuity.   Again,   the
demobilisation process cannot go on forever.

I know that hon  members  are  aware  that  we  are  now  dealing  with  the
Demobilisation  Amendment  Bill.  In  this  Bill  we  are  amending  certain
provisions of the Demobilisation Act of 1996, that is  Act  99  of  1996.  I
will therefore not bore members by dealing with issues which relate  to  the
principal Act. The Bill in front of us seeks to finalise the  demobilisation
process on or before 31 December 2002. All applications are to be in  on  or
before that date. There will  be  no  sense  in  keeping  the  process  open
indefinitely. This is what we are bringing to  this  Council  for  approval.
Let us agree that the demobilisation  process  is  to  be  completed  on  or
before 31 December 2002. The Minister and his Deputy  are  ready,  officials
are ready, the select committee is ready, and  it  is  my  belief  that  hon
members are also ready. Therefore, why should we not  allow  the  department
to do it?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  I  take  this
opportunity to welcome the Deputy Minister who was somehow  delayed,  and  I
call upon her to address the House.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, I thank the House  for  bearing
with me. I had a bit of an accident, but now I  am  here.  These  two  Bills
before the Council mark  an  important  milestone  in  the  history  of  the
transformation of South Africa, specifically in the  history  of  the  South
African military. As a result of the negotiation process a  new  force,  the
SA National Defence Force, was created on 27 April 1994, comprising the  old
SA Defence Force, the forces of the TBVC states and  Umkhonto  weSizwe,  the
armed wing of the ANC. At a  later  date  the  Azanian  People's  Liberation
Army, the armed wing of the PAC, became part of this process.

The new Constitution established a single  defence  force  to  be  the  only
lawful  military  force  in  the  Republic.  The  nonstatutory  forces  were
identified by a certified personnel register  commonly  known  as  the  CPR.
This is in essence a register of the members of MK and Apla which  has  been
verified. The completion of such a register  was  an  achievement  that  has
gone largely unrecognised. Guerrilla  formations  keep  records  differently
from conventional military forces. The liberation movements kept records  in
the most difficult of circumstances.  They  were  based  in  many  different
countries, and records, therefore, were not at any one time in  one  central
point, as avoiding the capturing of names was paramount.

In  addition,  the  levels  of  involvement  in  the  underground,   illegal
organisations differed widely. Whilst, on  the  one  hand,  one  would  find
combatants who had been trained militarily, they were housed  and  protected
by civilians who, on the other hand, had no  military  training  whatsoever.
Had those civilians been caught and arrested, they would also  have  paid  a
high price, as some of them did, in a similar manner to those  who  received
military training.

They also would have been  imprisoned  for  many  years  or  martyred.  Who,
therefore, can be classed as a member of the  nonstatutory  force,  and  who
cannot? I am just illustrating  the  difficulty  of  compiling  a  certified
personnel register.

Once settlement was made, it became an arduous and lengthy process to  bring
all the records into a centralised register. This  explains  the  liberality
with which we treated the timeframes surrounding the intake and  integration
process.

There was also suspicion as to the implications for  the  individuals  at  a
time when there was so much violence in our country aimed at  activists  who
had suspended the armed struggle. I am making this point to try and  explain
to the Council one aspect of the complexity of the  process  of  integrating
different armed formations into a single, united, military force.

These two Bills, as the chairperson has indicated, coming as they  do  seven
to eight years since the start of the integration  process,  bear  testimony
to the fact that, to all intents and purposes, this process must be seen  in
the context of the need to accelerate full integration of all  forces  where
all embrace the `one force' concept.

I am pleased to report to the Council that with all the  problems  that  can
be imagined in the carrying out of this process, the SANDF has  successfully
managed this process and  is  now  able  to  move  on  and  to  guide  other
countries facing the same challenges of integration.

In this case I want to remind members of the Freedom Day  parade  last  year
in  Bloemfontein,  which  clearly  demonstrated  the  strides  our  national
Defence Force has made in this regard.  The  demobilisation  of  members  of
nonstatutory forces has better prepared us  to  find  a  more  holistic  and
sustainable demobilisation programme that fully prepares ex-soldiers  for  a
full and sustainable integration into active civilian life, which  will  add
value to the Department of  Defence's  demobilisation  process,  which  will
continue into the future.

The Termination of Integration Intake Bill seeks to  bring  to  an  end  the
process of taking in members of MK and Apla for integration purposes.  There
will be an intake from 19 November to 4 December of around 175 persons,  and
the final intake will take place early next year, if necessary,  before  the
final date, just to make sure that  a  door  has  been  left  ajar  for  any
latecomers.

The Demobilisation Amendment Bill amends the definition  of  `closing  date'
by providing that the closing  date  shall  be  31  December  2002,  as  the
chairperson has indicated. This new date is fixed so as to allow members  of
MK and Apla who, for various reasons, are  unable  to  meet  the  employment
requirements of the SANDF, to demobilise.

The Portfolio Committee on Defence  held  a  public  hearing  on  these  two
Bills. This gave the Veterans' Associations of both MK and Apla a chance  to
raise issues  of  concern  with  the  oversight  committee.  Recommendations
coming from the oversight committee will be accommodated by the  department,
as much as we can.

The successful integration of  seven  military  formations  into  a  single,
lawful, loyal and professional military force is  one  of  democratic  South
Africa's most shining  achievements.  This  national  Defence  Force  unites
young South Africans from seven different forces, and we are  proud  to  say
that despite the problems we have faced we have  successfully  managed  this
process. I am pleased that this Bill is before this House, and look  forward
to input by hon members of this House [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, as the Demobilisation Amendment  Bill  only
seeks to amend the definition of the closing date in the principal  Act  and
as all relevant Government departments were consulted before  the  Bill  was
referred to the Cabinet, and as the  financial  implication  will  be  dealt
with through the current Budget, the NNP supports this Bill.

In  connection  with  the  Termination  of  Integration  Intake  Bill,   the
following concerns me.

The Department of Defence planned to have a final intake during November  as
they anticipated the end of integration on 31 December 2001.  As  this  date
has been moved back to 31 March 2002, it can cause logistical  problems  for
the SA Army as they are also busy with the final  intake  and  new  recruits
from the school-leavers. I would appreciate  it  if  the  hon  the  Minister
could elaborate on how they anticipate dealing  with  or  are  dealing  with
this challenge as we are already in the month of November.

Determining the final date  for  the  former  MK  and  Apla  members  to  be
integrated into the SANDF also symbolises a period of normalisation  in  the
new democratic order in South Africa, and, therefore, it is a  pleasure  for
the NNP to support this Bill.

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  today  we  are
dealing with the issue of demobilisation, which, after all,  is  not  unique
to our country. This is an issue which is universal and historic in  nature.
The demobilisation process takes place after cessation of hostilities,  when
a certain number of  former  combatants  who  are  no  longer  required  for
defence needs voluntarily want to demobilise. They have to  be  assisted  to
go back into civil society and find their feet.

This Bill amends the Demobilisation Act of 1996 so as to  make  it  possible
to demobilise members of Apla and MK who are unable to  conclude  agreements
of appointment with the SA National Defence Force on  account  of  them  not
satisfying the terms and conditions of service of the SANDF,  or  those  who
no longer wish to pursue  a  military  career.  The  closing  date  for  the
submission of an application  for  a  demobilisation  gratuity  will  be  31
December 2001.

Th Demobilisation Bill serves to assist the former combatants of the  former
liberation forces, namely uMkhonto weSizwe or MK and Apla, who cannot or  do
not intend to join  the  SANDF  for  the  particular  reasons  that  I  have
mentioned above. The specific recognition  of  these  liberation  forces  in
respect of their rights as nonstatutory forces to integrate stems  from  the
Transitional Executive Council Act of  1993.  Their  successful  integration
into society is, after all, in the best  interest  of  our  country  and  of
peace and stability. It is part of normalisation of our society.

As some of us know, the demobilisation programme commenced in 1995  when  it
became apparent that not all former MK and Apla members wished to  join  and
that there were also some who did wish to join, but for  reasons  like  age,
health problems, disability, or because they did not  succeed  in  terms  of
specific potential tests, they could not be guaranteed a  secure  career  in
the Defence Force.

On the  other  hand,  integration  has  been  ongoing  since  1994.  Section
236(18)(d) of the interim Constitution which continues to  be  in  force  by
virtue of item 24 of Schedule 6  of  the  Constitution,  provides  that  the
continuance of membership of  the  SANDF  by  members  of  the  nonstatutory
forces will be subject to  such  members  entering  into  an  agreement  for
temporary or permanent appointment  in  the  SANDF.  These  members  of  the
nonstatutory forces were required to  enter  into  the  agreement  within  a
reasonable time.

This Bill, the Termination of Integration Intake Bill  seeks  to  provide  a
legal framework for the termination of the intake of members of Apla and  MK
for integration purposes.

This Bill provides that members of Apla and MK who are eligible to  conclude
agreements with the SANDF should do so before 31 March 2002.

In brief, the Bill also provides for the integration of members of Apla  and
MK whose names appear in the certified personnel register or personnel  list
and who have been granted amnesty in terms  of  the  promotion  of  National
Unity and Reconciliation Act of 1995 after 31 March 2002.

In  conclusion,  I  would  like  to  highlight  that  our  country  has  the
responsibility to recognise in an even-handed way the right of those MK  and
Apla combatants, who served our country in the  armed  liberation  struggle,
to qualify for a demobilisation gratuity and integration  on  the  basis  of
exercising their right to join or not to join the SANDF. [Applause.]

Mnr J L THERON: Voorsitter, voldoende tyd is,  ingevolge  artikel  236(8)(d)
van die tussentydse grondwet, toegelaat vir die  integrering  van  lede  van
die verskillende weermagte in die Suid-Afrikaanse  Nasionale  Weermag.  Nou,
sewe en 'n half jaar later, is dit  duidelik  dat  die  tyd  vir  integrasie
verstryk het.

Dié uitgangspunt word ondersteun deur die hoof van die  SANW,  genl  Nyanda,
al die lede van die Portefeuljekomitee vir Verdediging en al  die  lede  van
die Gekose Komitee vir Veiligheid en Grondwetlike Aangeleenthede.  Almal  is
dit eens dat 'n redelike tyd verloop het. Die datum vir die beëindiging  van
integrasie in die SANW is vasgestel op 31 Maart 2001.

Tydens 'n voorlegging aan die Gesamentlike Komitee vir Verdediging het  lede
gehoor die gemiddelde koste verbonde aan die  integrasie  van  nie-statutêre
lede beloop gemiddeld R69 991. Hierdie  koste  moet  verhaal  word  uit  die
werwingsbegroting vir die boekjaar 2001-02. Dit verminder dus  die  SANW  se
vermoë om nuwe lede te werf, wat aanwendingsprobleme kan veroorsaak.

Die sterkte van die Weermag het soos volg gewissel: In 1994 was daar  82 700
lede; in 1996, 101 110; en in  2001,  78 701.  Die  verdedigingsoorsigriglyn
vir die SANW is 70 000 lede. Hiervolgens is  dit  duidelik  dat  regstelling
nog gedoen en nuwe lede nog geïntegreer moet word.  Die  probleme  volg  dus
ooglopend. Die getalle moet verminder word, en die huidige  lede  word  ouer
en kan nie meer  almal  effektief  operasioneel  aangewend  word  nie.  Nuwe
innames raak dus al hoe noodsaakliker om in die  huidige  behoeftes  te  kan
voorsien.

Aangaande die Wetsontwerp op Demobilisasie: diegene wat nie geregtig  is  om
ingevolge die bepalinge  en  vereistes  van  die  Suid-Afrikaanse  Nasionale
Weermag se indiensnemingsvereistes te kwalifiseer  nie,  asook  diegene  wat
uit eie keuse besluit  om  nie  te  integreer  nie,  en  op  voorwaarde  dat
diesulkes se name op  die  gesertifiseerde  personeelregister  verskyn,  sal
geregtig wees om te demobiliseer op 31 Desember  2001.  Demobilisasie  binne
hierdie verband beteken die uitbetaling van 'n bedrag van  R34 413.  Hierdie
uitgawes moet natuurlik ook kom uit die werwingsbegroting vir 2001-02.

Ek wil ook praat oor die pensioene van ander lede.  Nie  alle  veterane  het
pensioene ontvang nie. In hierdie verband dink  ons  veral  aan  die  Kaapse
Korps wat niks  ontvang  het  nie.  Ek  wil  graag  'n  beroep  op  die  agb
Adjunkminister doen om hierop te reageer, en ek hoop dat optrede in  hierdie
verband sal volg. Die agb Thandi Modise,  die  voorsitter  van  die  staande
komitee, het dieselfde punt geopper in die  Nasionale  Vergadering,  en  ons
verwag optrede in dié verband. Baie van hierdie lede van  die  Kaapse  Korps
het baie goeie diens gelewer, en ontvang nou niks in die verband nie.

Graag wil ek weer eens alle lede herinner om Sondag die elfde van die  elfde
maand, November, om 11-uur die oggend twee minute  stilte  te  handhaaf,  by
geskikte byeenkomste, om alle gestorwenes in alle oorloë te gedenk.  Dit  is
'n gebruik wat wêreldwyd gevolg word, en ons kan dus gerus  ook  ons  bydrae
lewer.
Om af te sluit, dit is belangrik dat  hierdie  prosesse  van  integrasie  en
demobilisering afgesluit word. Dit is uiters belangrik dat  Suid-Afrika  oor
een eensgesinde nasionale weermag moet beskik.  Die  doelwit  vorentoe  moet
dus  wees  om  'n  hoogs  professionele,  hoogs  opgeleide,  effektiewe   en
gefokusde weermag daar te stel waarop alle Suid-Afrikaners trots  kan  wees.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, in terms of section 236(8)(d)  of  the  interim
Constitution sufficient time was allowed for the integration of  members  of
the various defence forces into the South African  National  Defence  Force.
Now, seven  and  a  half  years  later,  it  is  clear  that  the  time  for
integration is over.

This point of departure is supported by the Chief of the SANDF, Gen  Nyanda,
all the members of the Portfolio Committee on Defence and  all  the  members
of the Select Committee on Security and Constitutional Affairs. Everyone  is
in agreement that a reasonable period  has  elapsed.  The  date  for  ending
integration into the SANDF was determined as being 31 March 2001.

During a submission to the Joint Committee on  Defence  members  heard  that
the average cost involved in the integration of nonstatutory members  amount
to about R69 991. These costs must be recovered from the recruitment  budget
for the 2001-02 financial year. This as a result reduces the ability of  the
SANDF to recruit  new  members,  which  could  cause  problems  relating  to
employment.

The strength of the Defence Force varied as follows: In 1994 there  were  82
700 members; in 1996 there were 101 110 and in 2001 there were 78  701.  The
defence review guideline for the SANDF is  70  000  members.  From  this  it
becomes clear that rectification still  has  to  take  place  and  that  new
members still have to be integrated. Problems  therefore  obviously  follow.
Numbers must be reduced, and the current members are getting older  and  not
all of them can be used effectively operationally any longer.  New  recruits
are therefore becoming increasingly essential in order to meet  the  present
requirements.

As far as the Demobilisation Bill is concerned: Those who are  not  entitled
to qualify, in terms of the provisions and requirements  of  the  employment
conditions of the SA National Defence Force, as well as those who  of  their
own free will decide not to be integrated, and on condition that  the  names
of such  persons  appear  on  the  certified  personnel  register,  will  be
entitled to demobilise on 31 December 2001. Demobilisation in  this  context
means the payment of an amount of R34 413.  These  expenses  must  naturally
come from the recruitment budget for 2001-02.

I also want to speak about the pensions of other members. Not  all  veterans
received pensions. In this regard we are  thinking  of  the  Cape  Corps  in
particular, who did not receive anything. I would like to appeal to the  hon
the Minister to react to this, and I hope that action will  follow  in  this
regard. The hon Thandi Modise, the chairperson of  the  standing  committee,
raised the same point in the National Assembly and we expect action in  this
regard. Many of these members of the Cape Corps rendered very good  service,
and now do not receive anything.

I would like to remind  members  once  again  Sunday  the  eleventh  of  the
eleventh month, November, at 11 o'clock  in  the  morning  to  maintain  two
minutes of silence, at appropriate gatherings, to commemorate all those  who
have died in all wars. This is a  custom  that  is  followed  all  over  the
world, and we may very well also make our contribution.

To conclude, it  is  important  that  these  processes  of  integration  and
demobilisation are concluded. It is extremely important  that  South  Africa
should have one unified national defence force. The objective in the  future
should therefore be to establish  a  highly  professional,  highly  trained,
effective and focused defence force of  which  all  South  Africans  can  be
proud. [Applause.]]

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, colleagues, it would appear that the  two  Bills
are  actually  aimed  at  streamlining  the  department's  activities.   The
chairperson  of  the  select  committee  and  the   Deputy   Minister   have
illustrated and explained the intentions of the two Bills. It seems  as  if,
from what the previous speakers have said, it does not look  like  there  is
any hanky-panky.

The IFP supports  the  Bill,  because  we  feel  that  it  is  fundamentally
important that we have a strong army to protect our democratic  country  and
to protect our citizens. [Applause.]

Mr T B  TAABE:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  I  rise  to  make  a  statement
basically on  the  occasion  of  the  passing  of  both  the  Demobilisation
Amendment Bill and the Termination of Integration Intake  Bill.  As  it  has
been pointed out by other members, including,  of  course,  our  hon  Deputy
Minister, in terms of the objects of the Bills before  the  House,  I  would
not really want to belabour the points already made, except to briefly  make
two very critical points which relate to both the processes  of  integration
and demobilisation.

In relation to both pieces  of  legislation,  whilst  these  processes  were
fairly successful and benefited  our  new  Defence  Force  and,  presumably,
those of  our  people  who  remained  in  the  force,  the  net  effect  of,
particularly, demobilisation was  somewhat  negative  for  the  majority  of
those who had to leave the force. It has therefore become crucial  that  we,
as legislators and as a country, should and must address  the  situation  of
those of our people who were negatively  affected  by  demobilisation  as  a
matter of extreme urgency.

I think that this would require, on all our part, clear  policy  shifts,  to
some extent, away from the mere processes of transformation of the  security
institutions towards a policy that is aimed, in the main,  at  and  benefits
those of our people who were adversely  affected  or  will  be  affected  by
whatever changes are being  contemplated.  In  this  regard,  I  think  that
particular attention should, therefore, be paid to those who remain  jobless
and those who are poverty-stricken,  since  the  potential  security  threat
lies with the disgruntled and demobilised persons. I felt that I  needed  to
put this message across.

The second point obviously relates to  the  whole  process  of  integration.
There was no one amongst us who, at some stage, said that  this  process  of
integration was going to be smooth sailing and hunky-dory in  terms  of  how
we were going to deal with this process. Numerous problems  emerged  in  the
process which I feel, to a very large extent, were addressed.  But  I  think
that we have to grapple with the problems that remain  in  order  to  ensure
that, at the end of the day, we are  all  able  to  continue  to  foster  in
society, in relation to the SA National  Defence  Force,  an  army  that  is
needed to meet international standards of competence and professionalism.

We need to be able to meet this most important and  strategic  objective  of
ensuring that the kind of  defence  we  have  serves  to  uphold  peace  and
security. That would ensure that we are able to create a stable  environment
for all our people's lives and for  the  development  and  progress  of  our
country.

In conclusion, I want to say that whatever we do as a  country,  legislators
and politicians sitting in this hallowed Chambers this  afternoon  -  across
the political spectrum  and  divide  -  we  should  seek  to  contribute  to
achieving these  set  objectives  in  the  most  practical  of  ways.  Quite
frankly, if we do not begin to do that as legislators across  the  political
divide and spectrum, as I have pointed out, I  think  that  that  in  itself
will be tantamount to committing what I shall refer to  as  political  hara-
kiri on all our part. I think that the amendments to  this  legislation  are
absolutely desirable. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  I  will  now
call upon the hon the Deputy Minister to respond  to  the  hara-kiri,  self-
demolition. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson and hon members of the  Council,
I really appreciate the input of the members  and  their  support  for  this
process, which helps the Department of Defence to achieve exactly  what  the
members have indicated as necessary in this  country  in  order  to  achieve
normalisation and stabilisation.

As I indicated in my input, we must congratulate our National Defence  Force
on the manner in which they  were  able  to  unite  seven  different  forces
coming from totally different backgrounds.  They  were  able  to  put  their
differences aside for the sake of our country.

With regard to some of  the  concerns  that  were  raised,  we  are  looking
forward to the recommendations of the portfolio  and  select  committees  on
this matter. As I  have  indicated,  we  will  take  into  account  members'
recommendations in as far as those areas that need  to  be  ironed  out  are
concerned. But, in terms of the closing date that we have  set,  we  do  not
expect a sudden influx of people that need to be integrated. As  it  is,  we
have catered for 175 persons, but we have left the door open in  case  there
are some last-minute applications.

But  I  want  to  say,  in  this  regard,  that  we  have  set  a  date  for
demobilisation to December 2000. This is precisely to allow  the  department
to cater for the demands that may arise because of  demobilisation.  We  are
quite prepared for this, and have budgeted for it.

Perhaps at this point I should say that integration was never  going  to  be
an easy process. As it is right now, we have established -  and  I  want  to
make this announcement  -  a  Military  Veterans  Association  Board,  which
advises the Minister of Defence on any  matter  relating  to  any  veterans.
This is an inclusive process as we also have veterans from the former  SADF,
and I am hoping that those people that were mentioned, such  as  those  from
the Cape Coloured Corps, will make use  of  this  structure  to  inform  the
Minister  about  their  specific  situation.  But  I  must  say  that  every
formation that came forward was given a chance to state its case.

I would therefore end by thanking members for their  contributions  and  for
their positive approach to the Bill that is before us. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Demobilisation Amendment Bill agreed to in accordance  with  section  75  of
the Constitution.

Termination of Integration Intake Bill agreed to in accordance with  section
75 of the Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
      AFFAIRS - MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATY BETWEEN RSA AND LESOTHO

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, over the past  few  years  the  South  African
Government has entered into a number of mutual legal assistance treaties  in
criminal matters with  other  countries.  This  is  because  South  Africans
realise  that  criminals  do  not   confine   themselves   to   geographical
boundaries. Their activities are spread  across  state  boundaries  and  are
helped by the technological explosion brought about by globalisation.

The international nature  of  many  criminal  enterprises  has  necessitated
closer  co-operation  between  governments.  The  treaty  on  mutual   legal
assistance in criminal matters between South Africa and Lesotho  is  a  very
important tool in the fight against  crime  both  in  South  Africa  and  in
Lesotho.

Given the proximity of these two countries, it  is  easy  for  criminals  to
commit crimes in either country, and then merely to slip across  the  border
between the two countries in an attempt to evade prosecution. This has,  for
example, happened in  cases  where  livestock  thieves  enter  either  South
Africa or Lesotho and then  hustle  cattle  and  other  animals  across  the
border.

Since both countries are sovereign states, it is impossible for  the  police
of either of these countries to enter each other's territory in  pursuit  of
these animals in the absence of express permission from  either  government.
The treaty on mutual co-operation will assist the law  enforcement  agencies
of both countries to deal with this and other crime problems.

The treaty seeks to improve the co-operation between the  two  countries  on
criminal matters, such as stock theft, by providing a vehicle through  which
assistance with regard to criminal matters can be obtained.

Pursuant to a request under the treaty, the requested authority  may  locate
persons; supply official records; execute searches and seizure of  property;
and arrange for the appearance of witnesses or experts before  the  relevant
judicial authority.

The treaty is also very clear in terms of  the  process  that  needs  to  be
followed with regard to the format the request for assistance  should  take.
In all cases,  the  request  for  assistance  must  indicate  the  competent
authority conducting the investigation; the nature  of  the  investigations;
the purpose of the request; the nature of the  assistance  sought;  and  any
time limit within which the request for assistance should be executed.

With the conclusion of this treaty, our Government  and  the  government  of
the Kingdom of Lesotho are  warning  criminals  that  neither  country  will
allow  their  territory  to  be  used  for  the  perpetuation  of   criminal
activities against the other.

Lastly, together with the  extradition  treaty  concluded  between  the  two
countries, we have no doubt  that  the  space  within  which  criminals  are
operating is becoming smaller and smaller. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
            AFFAIRS - EXTRADITION TREATY BETWEEN RSA AND LESOTHO

Prince  B  Z  ZULU:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  section  2(1)(a)  of   the
Extradition Act, Act 67 of 1962, provides that the President  may,  on  such
conditions as he may deem fit but subject to  the  provisions  of  the  Act,
enter into an agreement with any foreign state providing for the  surrender,
on a reciprocal basis, of a person accused or convicted of  the  commission,
within the jurisdiction of the Republic  or  such  state  or  any  territory
under the sovereignty or  protection  of  such  state,  of  an  extraditable
offence specified in such agreement.

Section 2(3)(a) of the Extradition Act provides that no  such  agreement  or
any amendment shall be of force or effect until  ratification  or  amendment
of such agreement has been agreed to by Parliament. The President  of  South
Africa approved the treaty on 19 April  2001,  and  it  was  signed  by  the
Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  and  his   Lesotho
counterpart on that date in Maseru.

Section 231(2) of the Constitution provides that an international  agreement
binds the Republic only after it has been approved  by  resolution  in  both
Houses, the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces,  unless
it is an agreement referred to in section 231(3).

The purpose of the treaty is to ensure our  effective  co-operation  in  the
prevention and suppression of crime, and also to indicate  to  the  rest  of
the world that South Africa will not be a safe  haven  for  criminals.  This
extradition treaty is the same as other treaties that  South  Africa  signed
with countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom of  Great  Britain  and
the United States of America.

The Minister for Law and Order and Constitutional Affairs of the Kingdom  of
Lesotho and the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development  of  the
Republic of South Africa and their respective prosecuting authorities  or  a
person designated by them may at any time consult with each other,  directly
or through the facilities of Interpol, in connection with the processing  of
individual cases and in furtherance of the efficient implementation of  this
treaty.
In conclusion, upon the coming into force of this  treaty,  the  extradition
agreement between the Government of South Africa and the Kingdom of  Lesotho
signed  in  Cape  Town  on  20  June  1995,  shall  cease  to  have  effect.
Nevertheless,  the  prior  agreement  shall   apply   to   any   extradition
proceedings in which the extradition documents have been  submitted  to  the
courts of the requested state at the time this treaty enters into force.

We therefore support the ratification of this treaty. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Report adopted in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
       AFFAIRS - PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW STATUTE OF HAGUE CONFERENCE

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, as it is  expected,  heads  of  delegations
will vote on behalf of the provinces after they have applied their minds  to
this statute. However, I would like to request them to at  least  listen  to
what I have to say, because it might be the first time that  they  encounter
anything about the statute.

The statute came into force on 26 August 1955, and it sets  out  the  object
of the conference as being to unify the rules of private international  law.
The secretary-general of the conference  in  the  Hague,  Netherlands,  made
numerous calls to South Africa to become a member of this conference.  As  a
result of the calls to join the conference, various interested parties  were
consulted  for  their  views,  and  the  majority  of  them  supported   the
membership for the following reasons. Membership  of  the  conference  would
advance South Africa's participation as a full member of  the  international
community. Being a member state of the conference, South Africa  would  keep
pace with foremost international developments. This  is  so  because  bigger
jurisdictions, such as the Netherlands  and  the  United  Kingdom,  who  are
member states of the conference and  whose  legal  systems  are  like  ours,
which is based on Roman Dutch law and  English  law,  have  undergone  rapid
changes, particularly in the field of private international law.

Furthermore, membership of  the  conference  would  promote  South  Africa's
economic and  trade  co-operation  with  trading  partners  who  are  mostly
members  of  this  conference.  Present  and  future  conventions   of   the
conference would bring  about  legal  uniformity  in  respect  of  rules  of
private international law between member states  who  are  parties  to  such
conventions and, secondly, serve  to  avoid  time-consuming  and  cumbersome
bilateral agreements.

Permanent membership of the  conference  may  contain  particular  political
benefits, consolidate South Africa's position as leader of Africa  and  also
strengthen its influence in the whole of Africa. The fields covered  by  the
conference are matters  of  great  concern  in  respect  of  South  Africa's
relationship with other countries. Membership will certainly facilitate  the
application of rules of private international law by our courts.  Membership
will facilitate accession to other conventions which South  Africa  has  not
yet acceded to.

South Africa's membership of the conference is of vital importance  for  the
administration of justice in South Africa.  The  convention  abolishing  the
requirement of legislation for foreign public documents is working  well  in
South Africa and sets an example  as  to  valuable  benefits  which  may  be
derived from South  Africa's  membership  of  the  conference  and  eventual
accession  to  other  remaining  conventions.  Furthermore,  the  conference
operates on an equal footing with member and nonmember  states,  recognising
equal sovereignty of states.

Membership of the conference would be in line with South Africa's return  to
the international community.  Membership  would  strengthen  South  Africa's
attempts to form closer links with the EU. Since it is not  so  unusual  now
to come across litigation  concerning  contracts,  or  the  negotiation  and
approval of contracts that have an international aspect, membership  of  the
conference may be very beneficial. Membership of the conference would be  in
line with  South  Africa's  Constitution,  which  expressly  recognises  the
important role of international law in our legal system.

Trade relations with member  states  will  necessitate  the  making  of  new
inroads into the field of private international law, with reference  to  the
law of contracts, recognition of  companies  and  jurisdiction  as  well  as
enforcement of foreign judgments. The following words  of  John  Dugard  set
out further reasons in favour of membership:


  Acceptance of values upon which modern international law is founded  will
  inevitably make South Africa acceptable to the  international  community.
  In these circumstances a renaissance of international law is likely  both
  in South Africa's foreign policy and in the jurisprudence of its courts.

It is also important to  mention  that  South  Africa  has  acceded  to  the
following conventions of the conference we are  discussing:  The  Convention
on the Conflicts of Law  Relating  to  Formal  Testimony  Dispositions;  the
Convention Abolishing the Requirement  of  Legislation  for  Foreign  Public
Documents; the Convention on the  Recognition  and  Enforcement  of  Foreign
Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters; the Convention on the  Taking  of
Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters; and the  Convention  on  the
Civil Aspects of International Child  Abduction,  to  which  the  hon  Lever
referred earlier today.

The department, through the Department of  Foreign  Affairs,  requested  the
Government of the Netherlands to support  South  Africa's  nomination  as  a
member of the conference. The majority of  the  members  of  the  conference
then voted in support of South Africa's membership.

In view of the above, South Africa became a member of  the  conference.  The
Select Committee on Security and Constitutional Affairs  having  considered,
through a request for approval by Parliament, that  the  Republic  of  South
Africa  accede  to  the  statute  of  the  Hague   Conference   on   Private
International Law referred to it, recommends that the Council, in  terms  of
article  6  of  the  statute,  designate  the  Department  of  Justice   and
Constitutional Development  as  the  national  office  for  the  purpose  of
communication with the members of the conference and the permanent bureau.

As the delegates and heads of delegations applied their minds  and  listened
to me thoroughly, I now request  members  of  this  House  to  support  this
statute of the Hague Conference on Private International Law. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Thank  you  for  your  well-
researched paper. I did not see you. I was thinking  that,  because  of  the
changing political landscape, you have changed your name also.

Debate concluded.

Report adopted in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.
The Council adjourned at 16:01.

                       Constitution, if he or she still  qualifies  to  hold
                       office as such a judge in  a  permanent  capacity  in
                       terms of section 3(2) or subsection (4).


           (c)   The holding of office by a judge referred to in  paragraph

                       the highest office held  as  a  Constitutional  Court
                       judge or a judge.


           (4)   A judge who on attaining the age of 70 years has  not  yet

                 period of 15 years' active service or attains the age of 75
                 years, whichever occurs first, whereupon he or she must  be
