                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move  at  the  next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern attempts by the Democratic Party to deny the South
       African public the right to information by walking out of  the  House
       (National Assembly), apparently in protest against the tabling of the
       report by three investigation units mandated by Parliament;


  (2) further notes that this is the very same party that always claims  to
       be an advocate of transparency  and  yet  when  Parliament  practises
       transparency, they decide to walk out;


  (3)  believes  that  South  Africa   achieved   its   democracy   through
       constructive engagement and that this is the spirit  that  should  be
       conserved;


  (4) therefore appeals to  the  Democratic  Party  to  stop  this  puerile
       behaviour of walking out when things do not go their way; and


  (5) further appeals to the Democratic  Party  to  start  considering  its
       tactics form and  embrace  the  spirit  of  debate  and  constructive
       criticism rather than confrontation in the new year.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I give notice that  I  shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the Council:
  That the Council -


  (1) notes that Jan Rabie, a pioneer of Afrikaans protest literature,  has
       died after a long illness at 81 years of age;


  (2) also notes that Rabie joined forces with writers such as N P van  Wyk
       Louw, Andr√© P Brink, Chris Barnard and Etienne le Roux in the 60s;


  (3) acknowledges that the so-called ``Sestigers'' irked the old  National
       Party Government  of  H  F  Verwoerd  and  John  Vorster  with  their
       sustained pen campaign against apartheid -  several  of  their  books
       were banned; and


  (4) further notes that Rabie leaves his wife, painter Marjorie Wallace.

Mev J WITBOOI: Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek tydens die volgende  sitting
van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem -


  (1) dat die DA se Wes-Kaapse kongres Saterdag te Stellenbosch 'n klug  en
       bloot 'n publisiteit- en intimidasie-foefie is;


  (2) dat die DA geen ledebasis of takke in die Wes-Kaap het nie en dat die
       oudit van lidmaatskap nou oorboord gegooi word om enigiemand  na  die
       sogenaamde kongres te nooi;


  (3) dat die Nuwe NP 'n beroep op raadslede doen om kalm te bly  en  hulle
       nie te laat intimideer deur die DP, wat tot onlangs groot kampvegters
       was vir die  skrapping  van  die  anti-oorloopklousule,  en  nou  die
       klousule aangryp om raadslede van hulle keuse van 'n politieke  party
       te beroof; en


  (4)  dat  die  Nuwe  NP  hierdie  ondemokratiese  wyse  van  goedkoop  en
       bedrieglike politiek verwerp en 'n beroep doen op raadslede om  hulle
       nie te laat misbruik deur politici wat dubbele standaarde predik nie.

[Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mrs J WITBOOI: Chairperson, I give notice that during the next  sitting  of
the Council I shall move:


  That the Council notes -


  (1) that the DA's Western Cape congress at Stellenbosch on Saturday is  a
       farce and merely a publicity and intimidation stunt;


  (2) that the DA has no membership basis or branches in the  Western  Cape
       and that the membership audit is now being thrown overboard in  order
       to invite anyone to the so-called congress;


  (3) that the New NP calls on councillors to remain calm and not to  allow
       themselves to be intimidated by the  DP  who,  until  recently,  were
       great champions for the  scrapping  of  the  clause  which  prohibits
       members from crossing the floor, but who  are  now  seizing  at  this
       clause to rob councillors of their choice of a political party; and


  (4) that the  New  NP  rejects  this  undemocratic  style  of  cheap  and
       deceitful politics and appeals to councillors not to  let  themselves
       be misled by politicians who are preaching double standards.

[Applause.]]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, I give  notice  that  I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  hundreds of Libyan troops have entered Zimbabwe to prop  up  the
           security  of  President  Mugabe,  as  President  Robert   Mugabe
           increasingly cannot rely on his own people;


       (b)  60 tourism companies have closed  down  in  Zimbabwe  this  year
           alone as well as the three main Zimbabwean bakeries with 10  000
           standing to lose their jobs;


       (c)  state-sponsored violence is being  increasingly  waged  by  Zanu
           (PF) militants and so-called war veterans against trade  unions,
           schools, newspapers, businesses and farmers; and


       (d)  the courageous recent statement on Zimbabwe by the president  of
           Botswana draws attention to the excesses  of  this  rogue  state
           that is lurching on to disaster; and


  (2) calls upon the Government of South Africa to  take  urgent  steps  to
       protect South African nationals and our  national  interest  in  that
       country.

HON MEMBERS: Hoor, hoor! [Hear, hear!]

       REPORT ON FORENSIC INVESTIGATION INTO ARMS ACQUISITION PROCESS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1)  notes  the  release  of  the  report  on  the   year-long   forensic
       investigation by the Auditor-General, the Public  Protector  and  the
       National Director of Public Prosecutions into  the  arms  acquisition
       process;


  (2)  further  notes  that  the  report  has  cleared  Government  of  any
       wrongdoing during this process;


  (3) believes the exoneration of Government  confirms  its  commitment  to
       clean and accountable governance; and


  (4) calls on opposition parties to accept the outcome of this independent
       investigation and to refrain from misleading ordinary South  Africans
       by twisting the truth for cheap political gain.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Is  there  any
objection?

Mr J L THERON: Yes, Chairperson.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  In  the  light
of the objection, the motion may not be proceeded with. It will  now  become
notice of a motion.
                          DEATH OF MR HOOSAIN PAHAD

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms S N NTLABATI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with sadness the sudden departure of Mr Hoosain  Pahad,  father
       to honourable Ministers Essop and Aziz Pahad;


  (2) further notes that Mr Hoosain Pahad, a former member of the Transvaal
       Indian Congress, made a special contribution in the struggle  against
       apartheid; and


  (3) offers its condolences to the family.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       ANNIVERSARY OF ARRIVAL OF FIRST INDENTURED LABOURERS FROM INDIA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that today, 16 November 2001, marks the arrival  of  the  first
       batch of indentured labourers from India to  kick-start  the  nascent
       sugar industry in colonial Natal in 1860;


  (2) further notes that the small Indian minority now nearing just over  a
       million people have since shown remarkable resilience in the face  of
       adversity in making significant contributions towards  enriching  the
       texture of life in South Africa in the arts  and  sciences,  law  and
       medicine, education, commerce industry and in politics, no less; and


  (3)  joins  its  fellow  South  African  compatriots  in  observing   the
       anniversary of the arrival of their forebears 141 years ago.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

               WEARING OF HATS ON LAST SITTING DAY OF SESSION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


   (1)      notes that there is a convention in this  Council  that  on  the
        last sitting day members wear hats;


   (2)      further notes that today members ignored this convention, except
        for the Chairperson of Committees, who is  wearing  a  hat  on  her
        dress; and


   (3)      resolves to look into this convention and be aware  of  it  next
        year this time.


[Interjections.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      DEATH OF MOTHER OF MR T S SETONA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C S BOTHA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council expresses its sympathy with Mr Setona, the delegate from
  the Free State, whose mother passed away yesterday.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Order!   Our
condolences will be sent to the Setona family.

                     MURDER CHARGE AGAINST PIET ODENDAAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That the Council -


  (1) notes with disdain and  distress  that  Piet  Odendaal's  charge  was
       altered from murder to homicide by the High Court in Bloemfontein  on
       Monday, 12 November 2001;


  (2) notes that he was given  a  seven-year  sentence  for  murdering  and
       dragging the body of his employee Mampuru for over five kilometres on
       gravel road; and


  (3) is aware of the racial implications of  such  convictions  and  hopes
       that the leave to appeal that has been granted him will  ensure  that
       punishment will be commensurate with the gravity of this crime, which
       makes human life seem to be cheap.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Is  there  any
objection to this motion? I am trying to find out from the  Council  whether
we can decide on a matter where the court must give a decision. Will  it  be
appropriate for us to deliberate on this? I have difficulty with it  as  the
Chair.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I object on those grounds.

An HON MEMBER: Sentence has been passed.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Yes, but  there
is a notice to appeal. The court will decide whether to allow the appeal  or
to uphold the judgment passed by the court. It is still a matter which  will
be decided upon. I will accept an objection from Mr Van Niekerk.  Even  from
the Chair, I was not going to allow this motion  to  be  approved.  It  will
therefore become notice of a motion.

           ``WOORDEBOEK VAN DIE AFRIKAANSE TAAL'' ACT REPEAL BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister, hon colleagues, in our new-
found democracy it is important that  we,  as  legislators  elected  by  the
people  of  this  country,  respond  to  the   vision   contained   in   our
Constitution, which is stated in the following words:


  We, the people of South Africa ...
  Believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it,  united  in  our
  diversity.

As does our Constitution, all of us recognise that the entity  described  as
the South African nation is made  up  of  diverse  linguistic  and  cultural
groups.  The  Bill  before  us  today  provides  for  the  repeal   of   the
``Woordeboek van  die  Afrikaanse  Taal''  Act  of  1973,  and  for  matters
connected therewith. The abrogation of the Act should be  seen  against  the
evolving linguistic background which seeks to give a common  identity  to  a
nation once divided by  the  according  of  superior  status  to  a  popular
language.

It was this vexing question that almost took us as a nation into the  abyss,
and yet as we meet here today there are those amongst  us  who  would  argue
for protection against what some call the marginalisation of their  language
and culture. Nothing can be further from the truth. The  real  problem  lies
in a very fundamental question: What must we do to  create  a  situation  of
equality amongst our diverse linguistic groups?

As a Government elected by the people,  we  are  mandated  to  correct  this
historically skewed situation. Section 6(5)(a) of the  Constitution  clearly
lays down the challenge  to  us.  The  Pan  South  African  Language  Board,
established by national legislation, must promote and create conditions  for
all languages. We are also mindful that in order to do so,  we  should  give
consideration to the concerns and  views  of  all  stakeholders  across  the
linguistic, cultural and racial divides.

The ``Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse  Taal''  Act  Repeal  Bill  is  in  this
respect in line with the constitutional obligation, in that it provides  for
the establishment of lexicography units for all our languages.  These  units
will not only ensure the preservation and documenting of our languages,  but
also the creation of monolingual defining dictionaries to satisfy the  users
and potential users of our languages. The Bill was drafted  jointly  by  the
Pan South African Language  Board  and  the  Department  of  Arts,  Culture,
Science and Technology.

In terms of the legal obligation of PanSALB, the bureau of the  ``Woordeboek
van die Afrikaanse Taal''  will  be  succeeded  by  the  Pan  South  African
Language Board Act of 1995. The Bill provides for the devolution of all  the
assets, rights and obligations to the new ``Woordeboek  van  die  Afrikaanse
Taal'' section 21 company. With regard to the rights and service  conditions
of employees of the ``Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse  Taal'',  all  employees
will remain in employment, as provided in the Labour Ralations Act, and  the
new ``Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal'' section 21 company will  be  tied
to all the agreements entered into with the trade unions.

In conclusion,  we  are  convinced  that  the  linguistic  richness  of  the
Afrikaans language will continue  to  prosper  and  that  its  use  will  be
greatly enhanced in the new era. We will all join hands to see  to  it  that
all languages get equal status - Afrikaans,  English,  isiZulu  and  others.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Declaration of vote:

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, namens die Nuwe  NP  wil  ek  die  volgende
stemverklaring doen. Met die herroeping van die Wet op  die  Woordeboek  van
die Afrikaanse Taal, soos gewysig, bereik die proses van  woordeboekmaak  in
Suid-Afrika 'n baie mooi hoogtepunt.
Voortaan kan Afrikaans en  die  ander  inheemse  tale  in  Suid-Afrika  saam
woordeboeke ontwikkel, in belang van al die tale  se  gebruikers.  Aangesien
nie net eentalige woordeboeke saamgestel sal word nie, maar  ook  meertalige
woordeboeke,  sal  dit  ook  'n  daadwerklike  bydrae  kan  lewer  tot   die
noodsaaklike bevordering van veeltaligheid in Suid-Afrika.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on behalf of the New NP  I  want  to  make
the following declaration of vote. With the repeal of  the  `Woordeboek  van
die  Afrikaanse  Taal'  Act,  as  amended,  the   procedure   of   compiling
dictionaries in South Africa has reached a very fine culmination.

From now on Afrikaans and the other indigenous  languages  in  South  Africa
can compile dictionaries together, in the interests of the users of all  the
languages. Because not only unilingual dictionaries will  be  compiled,  but
multilingual ones as well, this will also make a  decisive  contribution  to
the prerequisite promotion of multilinguism in South Africa.]

In 1893 the ``Woordeboek  van  de  Nederlandse  Taal''  in  the  Netherlands
approached President Paul Kruger for financial help to save that  dictionary
and 250 pounds were donated. Now that the ``Woordeboek vir  Afrikaans''  has
become a section 21 company and  is  in  need  of  donations,  our  language
friends in the Netherlands should  take  note  of  the  historic  facts  and
consider their involvement in this new lexicography era.

We support the Bill.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                   ACADEMY OF SCIENCE OF SOUTH AFRICA BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  I  take  this
opportunity to welcome the Deputy Minister of  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
Technology.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, the hon the Deputy Minister  has
undergo an operation and it is extremely difficult for her to stand  as  she
speaks to the House. May I ask you, Chairperson, to permit  her  to  address
the House whilst seated?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Musheana):  The  hon  the  Deputy
Minister is welcome to do so.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Chairperson,
members of the House and colleagues, science academies play a valuable  role
in the science and technology systems of many  countries.  In  South  Africa
different academies and  similar  bodies  have,  until  now,  furthered  the
interests of different sections of  our  scientific  community,  often  very
competently. We are now ready to recognise a single representative  body  as
an academy that can embody the interests of all sectors  of  the  scientific
community rather than just specific subgroups.

To date, the academy has functioned as an unofficial body. It was  initially
established in 1989. Post 1994, scientists interested in the  academy  began
a process of extensive  consultation  to  ensure  that  they  established  a
representative science academy;  an  academy  that  would  be  home  to  the
natural sciences, social science, the  humanities,  the  economic  sciences,
engineering and the health sciences, as well as agricultural sciences.

We are happy today  that  indeed  this  has  happened.  After  an  extensive
consultative process, the Academy of Science of SA, Assaf, came  into  being
in 1996 at an inaugural meeting where  its  founding  members  accepted  its
constitution. Its membership includes a wide variety of scientists from  all
scientific disciplines and indeed it is nondiscriminatory on  the  basis  of
race and gender.

Government has a distinct need for an overarching academy that is  the  only
officially recognised body representing the full spectrum of  South  African
scientists. There are occasions when inputs from scientists are needed  from
a single reputable source. In the process of international co-operation,  it
is often appropriate to enter into co-operation  agreements  with  academies
in other countries, for which we need a  local  academy  that  has  official
status.

Scientists themselves who have to consider  accepting  membership  need  the
assurance that the body they are invited to join is indeed  a  distinguished
body, of which it will be an honour to be a member. We expect Assaf to  meet
the needs as mentioned and that the  Government  will  productively  utilise
Assaf to provide advice on policy and strategy.

The Bill establishes what I have been referring to  by  its  acronym  Assaf,
the Academy of Science of SA, which will seek to mobilise the whole  science
and technology community. Its objectives will be to  promote  common  ground
in scientific thinking across all scientific fields  and,  in  addition,  to
promote the optimum development of the intellectual capacity of  all  people
in the country. It must further  provide  effective  advice  and  facilitate
appropriate action in relation to the collective  needs,  opportunities  and
challenges of all South Africans in the field of science and technology.

The objectives of the academy are designed to ensure  that  individuals  who
have made significant contributions to science act  in  concert  and  across
all disciplines in providing direction to  the  scientific  community.  They
must facilitate appropriate action in  relation  to  the  collective  needs,
threats, opportunities and indeed challenges of all South Africans.

The  Bill  provides,  then,  for  the  establishment  of  this  academy,  an
autonomous body corporate with perpetual succession and  legal  personality.
The  expectation  is  that  it  will   articulate   scientific   viewpoints,
information and thinking within  the  scientific  community.  We  anticipate
that it will become a valuable source of advice  on  matters  of  Government
science and technology policy.  It  is  regarded  as  appropriate  that  the
academy be established  under  its  own  dedicated  legislation.  This  will
provide full clarity regarding its functions and provide the basis  for  the
openness and transparency  of  its  activities.  The  academy  will  thereby
become known to the public at large.

Large parts of the legislation are based on the content of the  constitution
according to which the  academy  is  already  operating.  To  emphasise  its
status as  the  only  officially  recognised  academy,  the  Bill  therefore
proposes the repeal of the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir  Wetenskap  en  Kuns
Act. As a body corporate with perpetual  succession  and  legal  personality
sanctioned  by  an  Act  of  Parliament,  Assaf  will  enjoy   international
acceptance and credibility as its reputation  is  thus  recognised  and  its
constitution or objectives cannot be changed at will.

The academy differs from  existing  bodies  such  as  the  SA  Akademie  vir
Wetenskap en Kuns and the Engineering Academy of SA in that  it  serves  all
language and cultural groups in all disciplines of science. The SA  Akademie
vir Wetenskap en Kuns is the only similar body that is currently  recognised
by law, hence that body's Act is the only Act that needs to be repealed.

We are currently in discussion with the SA Akademie vir Wetenskap  en  Kuns,
recognising that the transitional arrangements in the legislation allow  for
the SA Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns not to lose momentum in its work.  The
members of that body expressed  support  for  this  Bill,  but  we  wish  to
determine  any  involvement  they  may  need  from  us  to  transform  their
organisation's status in a way that will enable  them  to  continue  playing
the constructive role that they are capable of. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister  and  colleagues,  in  October
1989 a need was identified for the establishment  of  an  academy  that  was
truly representative of  all  scientific  disciplines  -  that  is,  natural
science, social science,  the  humanities,  economic  science,  engineering,
health science and agricultural sciences - within all cultural  communities.
As a result thereof, the Academy of Science of SA, or Assaf, as the hon  the
Deputy Minister has pointed out, has now been established with  support  and
representation from  a  wide  variety  of  scientists  from  all  scientific
disciplines and communities.

The Bill provides for the establishment  of  Assaf  as  an  autonomous  body
corporate with perpetual succession and legal personality. The  Minister  of
Arts, Culture, Science and Technology will  utilise  Assaf  to  provide  the
department with advice and perform specific functions such as entering  into
agreements with peer organisations in other countries.  Assaf  will  be  the
only science academy recognised by Government.

As  a  body  corporate  with  perpetual  succession  and  legal  personality
sanctioned  by  an  Act  of  Parliament,  Assaf  will  enjoy   international
acceptance and  credibility  as  its  constitution  and  objects  cannot  be
changed at will.

The objects of Assaf are aimed at ensuring that individuals  who  have  made
significant  contributions  to  science,  act  in  concert  and  across  all
disciplines in providing direction to the scientific community  and  at  the
facilitation of appropriate action in  relation  to  the  collective  needs,
threats, opportunities and challenges of all South Africans.

In terms of clause 17, the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir  Wetenskap  en  Kuns
Act of 1959 is repealed so that only  one  science  academy,  which  has  an
overarching scope of activity, is recognised. [Interjection.]

Assaf acts as an autonomous body, while  its  members  are  elected  on  the
basis of the highest level of scientific thinking and knowledge and  on  the
basis of a significant contribution in  the  service  of  the  nation  as  a
whole.

Assaf acts as an independent instrument, enabling the  scientific  community
to make sufficient  contributions  to  policy,  advisory  or  implementation
bodies, in a co-ordinated and representative manner. [Applause.]

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, I thought I got married years ago  and  that  my
surname had not changed. I am still Kgoali. I can see here on the  speakers'
list that they decided to spell my surname in the manner in which they  did,
but I am sure this will be corrected at some stage.
One of the indicators  of  the  degree  of  sophistication  of  a  country's
science and technology systems  is  the  range  of  science  and  technology
institutions that exist in that particular  country.  This  Bill  officially
introduces one of the last national bodies that our country needs  in  order
to put its systems on par with the best in the world, namely the Academy  of
Science of SA, commonly known as Assaf.

The national bodies in this set  of  institutions  include  a  comprehensive
range of research institutions, such  as  the  CSIR,  the  Medical  Research
Council and several others. Our national standards body, the  SA  Bureau  of
Standards,  has  been  rated  as  one  of  the  best  in  the  world  by  an
international review panel.

At  our  universities  one  can  find  research  units  that  do   extremely
sophisticated research. These research bodies can,  however,  only  function
optimally if they are directed properly by a range of umbrella  bodies  that
set the tone for science and technology activities in the country.

At this stage, we have bodies such  as  the  National  Advisory  Council  on
Innovation, the National Science and Technology Forum, professional  bodies,
including the SA Council for Natural  Scientific  Professions,  and  others.
The Academy of Science of SA will enrich this group of bodies  significantly
and we welcome its formal establishment through this Bill.

As we know, the academy has been in existence for a few  years,  functioning
as an unofficial body. It is  therefore  appropriate  that  we  pay  tribute
today to those dedicated people who were instrumental  in  establishing  the
academy. We admire their dedication, vision and perseverance. We  can  today
all be proud that through their efforts, an  academy  of  science  has  been
established  that  is  representative  of  all  cultural  groups   and   all
scientific disciplines in the country.

Those founding members and, indeed, all academy members and  all  scientists
can now look back in satisfaction on their activities over  the  past  years
knowing that they have achieved something worthwhile. They will probably  be
pleased that today this Bill is going through one of  its  final  stages  in
becoming law.

Students of science and technology systems today  generally  recognise  that
one of the critical success factors for science  and  technology  is  cross-
pollination between different fields of science and technology.

The academy provides a very  useful  platform  for  eminent  scientists  and
engineers to get together, to network, and thus to exchange views and  ideas
in a way that will promote the advancement of science in the country.

We would be amiss not to also recognise  the  support  which  other  learned
associations in the country have given to this academy. In fact, the  active
support that many of them gave the academy until now has been  an  important
factor in bringing about the achievement that we  are  witnessing  with  the
passing of this Bill.

We think of bodies such as the Royal Society of  SA,  the  SA  Akademie  vir
Wetenskap en Kuns and the Engineering Academy of SA. These  bodies  are  all
anxious to co-operate with this academy. We  trust  that  the  academy  will
take up the challenge of becoming a worthy  co-ordinator  of  activities  of
all these bodies and their members. We  are  indeed  pleased  to  note  that
members of these bodies now have dual membership of Assaf and of one of  the
more specialised bodies which they belonged to earlier.
The South African Government is keenly aware of the need for it to be  aware
of the views of eminent scientists regarding science and  technology  policy
and strategy. It is certain to find this academy a  valuable  body  in  this
regard. We expect that the Government will regularly assist the academy  and
request it to investigate science policy options and to use  fruitfully  the
advice that emanates from this body.

This academy's task is by no means trivial, and  we  trust  that  Government
will be able to give it the moral support to  fulfil  its  obligations.  Its
objective of promoting scientific thinking in  the  country  is  formidable,
given the small fraction of the population that is  scientifically  literate
at this point in time. We are confident that the academy  will  be  able  to
find a niche for itself in the range of activities that need to  take  place
to increase the depth and breadth  of  understanding  of  science  in  South
Africa.

In this age  in  which  globalisation  and  international  networks  are  so
important, we also have great expectations that the academy will help  South
Africa in its scientific collaboration with other countries. We are  pleased
to note the international activities they have already embarked  upon,  such
as the co-operation agreement with their counterpart academy in  Russia.  We
wish them well furthermore with the assistance that they  will  be  able  to
give regarding the establishment of academies where they  do  not  exist  in
other allied countries.

The last important task that we  wish  to  mention  is  that  of  scientific
publishing. Through quality publications, they can become  the  shop  window
of excellence of the scientific community in South Africa.

We commend the  Ministry  of  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and  Technology  for
presenting us with this Bill and we have no  hesitation  in  supporting  it.
[Applause.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, baie dankie, die Akademie vir Wetenskap  en
Kuns het in die vroe√´ negentigerjare saam met die Royal Society die  leiding
geneem  om  die  Academy  of  Science  of  South  Africa  te  stig.  Hierdie
wetsontwerp vestig Assaf as 'n outonome liggaam en regspersoon, wat  as  die
enigste wetenskap akademie deur die staat erken sal word.

Assaf verskil van bestaande liggame  soos  die  Akademie  vir  Wetenskap  en
Kuns, die Royal Society en die  Akademie  van  Ingenieurs  van  Suid-Afrika,
deurdat dit alle taal-  en  kultuurgroepe  in  alle  wetenskap  dissiplines,
insluitende die geesteswetenskappe, sal bedien.

Die  wetsontwerp  skep  'n  juridiese  persoon,  maak  voorsiening  vir   sy
doelwitte en funksie, verhoudings met die  regering,  samestelling  van  die
akademie, sy raad, komitees, voorwaardes  vir  aanstellings  en  bedankings,
ens.

Die wetsontwerp herroep die SA Akademie vir Wetenskap en  Kunswet,  1959  en
bepaal die oorgangsmaatre√´ls vir verwante sake. Dit is egter  belangrik  dat
dit nie die akademie self vervang nie. Lede  van  die  akademie  is  taamlik
verward hieroor.

Die akademie bly op sy eie stoom voortbestaan en sal  steeds  sy  kundigheid
inspan vir die Afrikaanse  gemeenskap,  maar  ook  vir  die  ander  inheemse
groepe as hulle dit sou wou h√™. Dit is 'n hulpbron wat moet voortbestaan  en
aangewend moet word. Ek bedank die agb adjunkminister  en  haar  departement
vir hul positiewe gesindheid jeens die werk wat die akademie in die  verlede
gedoen het en die positiewe rol wat dit in die toekoms moet speel.

Ongelukkig is daar 'n bitter smakie in  die  mond.  Ondanks  talle  versoeke
bestaan die gevoel dat die akademie nie  voldoende  geraadpleeg  is  in  die
regering se besluit om summier die statut√™re bestaan  van  die  akademie  te
be√´indig en om terugwerkend die klein, maar broodnodige, jaarlikse  subsidie
van R128¬†000 terug te trek nie.

Nietemin het die uitvoerende  bestuur  van  die  akademie  dit  herhaaldelik
beklemtoon  dat  hy  nie  die  aanvaarding  en  inwerkingstelling  van   die
wetsontwerp  enigsins  in  gevaar   wil   stel   of   teenstaan   nie.   Die
wetenskapgemeenskap het 'n aantal jare lank hard gewerk om  di√©  wetsontwerp
tot stand te bring. Die proses wat veral deur  die  departement  gevolg  is,
het nie die gewenste  bewuswording  of  algemene  deursigtigheid  onder  die
parlement√™re verteenwoordigers of die bre√´ publiek bewerkstellig nie.

Dit is  jammer,  maar  die  Nuwe  NP  ondersteun  nogtans  die  wetsontwerp.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, thank you  very  much,  the  Akademie  vir
Wetenskap en Kuns, together with the Royal Society, took  the  lead  in  the
early 1990s to establish the Academy of Science of South Africa.  This  Bill
establishes Assaf as an autonomous body and a juristic  person,  which  will
be recognised by the state as the only science academy.

Assaf differs from existing bodies such as the  Akademie  vir  Wetenskap  en
Kuns, the Royal Society and the Academy of Engineers  of  South  Africa,  in
that it  will  serve  all  language  and  cultural  groups  in  all  science
disciplines, including the humanities. This Bill creates a juristic  person,
makes provision for its objectives and its function, its  relationship  with
the government, the composition of the  academy,  its  council,  committees,
conditions for appointment and resignation, etc.

This Bill  repeals  the  Akademie  vir  Wetenskap  en  Kuns  Act,  1959  and
determines the transitional measures for related  matters.  However,  it  is
important that this does not replace the  academy  itself.  Members  of  the
academy are fairly confused about this.

The academy will continue to exist in its own right and  will  still  employ
its expertise for the Afrikaans community, but  also  for  other  indigenous
groups if they too require it. This is a  resource  that  must  continue  to
exist and be  utilised.  I  thank  the  hon  the  Deputy  Minister  and  her
department for their positive attitude towards the  work  that  the  academy
has done in the past and the positive role that it must play in future.

Unfortunately,  there  is  something  of  a  bad   taste   in   the   mouth.
Notwithstanding many  requests,  there  still  exists  a  feeling  that  the
academy was not adequately consulted in the decision of  the  Government  to
summarily end the statutory existence of the academy and to  retrospectively
withdraw the small but very important annual subsidy of R128 000.

However, the executive management of the academy repeatedly emphasized  that
it did not wish to jeopardise the passing and implementation of the Bill  in
any way, or to oppose it. The science community has  worked  very  hard  for
several years to  establish  this  Bill.  The  process  which  as  followed,
especially by the department,  did  not  create  the  desired  awareness  or
general transparency among  parliamentary  representatives  or  the  general
public.

This is a pity, but the  New  NP  will  support  this  Bill  all  the  same.
[Applause.]]

Mr B  J  TOLO:  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  Minister  and  hon  members,  the
scientific  and  technological  revolution   of   the   last   two   decades
demonstrated to us and the rest of the developing world the challenges  that
we still face in this new millennium.

In this  context,  the  quest  for  unity  in  South  Africa's  science  and
technology is of critical importance. South Africa lacks an academy that  is
truly representative of all disciplines, as mentioned  earlier  by  the  hon
the Deputy Minister.

In the absence of an official representative body, the  Academy  of  Science
of SA has fulfilled  this  role  voluntarily.  It  comprises  a  variety  of
sciences  across  the  scientific  spectrum,  but   still   lacks   adequate
represention of the entire country.

The challenge for  Government  at  present  is  the  creation  of  a  single
distinguished  umbrella  academy  that  will  be  the  only   official   and
recognised  body  in  South  Africa  and   fully   representative   of   all
disciplines. This body will ensure that co-operation,  agreements,  exchange
programmes, etc are established with reputable academies around the world.

Moreover, it will benefit from the cross-pollination in  terms  of  research
output.  It  will  ensure  higher  volumes  of  research  output.  It  makes
provision for the  Minister  to  provide  the  department  with  advice  and
perform specific functions.

In terms of the Bill, Assaf will be established as an autonomous body  under
separate legislation in order to promote openness and transparency.  Because
the SA Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns, the hon Mr Raju should take note,  is
the only legally recognised academy in this country today,  the  Bill  seeks
to  repeal  its  founding  Act.  However,  the  department  is  at   present
negotiating with  the  akademie  to  ensure  continuity  in  its  scientific
activities.

We can confidently state that they have expressed their unqualified  support
for the new academy.
In conclusion, we are confident that Assaf will contribute  to  the  overall
significance of the  work  of  the  existing  scientific  and  technological
bodies already doing ground-breaking work in this country.

We support this Bill unreservedly. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Chairperson,
I want to congratulate all those who participated in the  drafting  of  this
Bill and in the discussions around the principles  thereof,  especially  the
role that the portfolio committee played.

At the outset I want to respond to the input of Mr Van Niekerk. We  have  an
obligation to break with the past and this much is understood by members  of
the SA Akademie vir Wetenskap  en  Kuns.  We  have  to  operate  within  the
context of our Constitution, which promotes equity and  the  development  of
all the people of this country.

We cannot, therefore, continue in  the  old  mode  of  working  in  separate
groupings as was the tendency in the past. I am pleased that members of  the
SA Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns are willing to find a way of feeding  into
the new academy that we launch today with this Bill. All of us  should  work
towards helping them in that regard.

The establishment of this national South African academy  will  enhance  the
development of excellence in the fields of science and technology. This  can
only happen if all our people in the fields of science  and  technology  can
work together in co-operation.

We look forward to the role that the academy will play. Here I  think  about
the very important role of promoting research and of producing  the  science
journal.

We look forward to their representing  this  country  and  interacting  with
their peers internationally. I must thank everybody  for  their  support  of
this Bill.

There is not much more to say, because we all support the Bill.  [Applause.]


Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.
                    AFRICA INSTITUTE OF SOUTH AFRICA BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY:
Chair, this Bill is the culmination  of  a  transformation  process  of  the
Africa Institute of SA that started in 1997 with the review of  science  and
engineering institutions by the Department of  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
Technology.

The institute has been in existence for some time. It was  used  extensively
as a source of  information  on  African  countries,  and  for  conveying  a
carefully crafted view  on  developments  in  the  continent.  It  became  a
formidable  repository  of  information  on  Africa,  but  because  of   the
political climate at the time it did not  have  the  degree  of  interaction
with scholars and others in the rest of Africa  and  the  world  that  would
have been expected otherwise from an institution of its kind.

With the advent of democracy in 1994, South Africa's relationship  with  the
rest of Africa changed completely. With it came  the  need  to  rethink  the
role of the Africa Institute, and the development paradigm  of  the  African
Renaissance  and  the  challenge  of  a  credible  base  of   knowledge   on
development challenges on the continent also called  for  a  review  of  the
research content of this area.

By 1997 it was  clear  that  a  fundamental  reform  of  the  institute  was
necessary. The review panel that was then appointed came up  with  a  number
of options. After consideration its  options,  this  Bill  was  born.  Among
other  things  the  review  panel  said  that  the  Aisa  needed  a   double
turnaround. Firstly, a change in perspective  that  would  help  it  to  see
Africa no longer through foreign eyes, but from within  Africa  -  in  other
words, a paradigm shift that would enhance  our  objective  of  the  African
Renaissance.

The Bill now seeks to  convert  the  Africa  Institute  from  a  section  21
company to a statutory body that does research and will  function  under  an
Act  of  Parliament  that  is  similar  to  those  governing  other  science
councils. By bringing the Africa Institute into the family  of  science  and
technology  institutions  regulated  by   institution-specific   Acts,   the
necessary interaction and multidisciplinary approaches will be promoted.  We
will, in collaboration with the council of the Africa  Institute,  be  in  a
stronger position to guide and evaluate the activities of the institute.

Furthermore, the efficiency of the Africa  Institute  will  be  enhanced  by
bringing this institute into the system of science and technology funded  by
way of a science vote which allocates funds according to  national  research
priorities, using, amongst other things, a process of  competitive  bidding.
Members may be aware of the financial reporting system that  was  instituted
by  science  councils.  This  includes  procedures   for   determining   key
performance indicators for these institutions, and  then  reporting  against
them. This will be a more suitable vehicle  for  ensuring  that  the  Africa
Institute,  along   with   other   institutions,   performs   according   to
expectations and justifies entrusting the responsibilities in this  Bill  to
it.

The Africa Institute's functions  include  the  collecting,  processing  and
interpretation of information on  Africa,  especially  on  Southern  African
affairs. It should do this by means of analysing and  researching  and  then
disseminating  information,  its  findings  and  analysis  through  suitable
media. It is required  to  carry  out  this  dissemination  process  through
periodicals and other publications,  seminars,  workshops,  conferences  and
commentary to the mass media.

As the principal state-supported and nationally based organisation  for  the
study of African affairs, the institute  has  a  public  education  role  to
inform South African society at large, including politicians,  professionals
and lay persons, about trends and events in Africa.

The governing council of Aisa is at present composed of six  representatives
elected by members of the institute, three representatives  from  the  South
African universities and one representative appointed by the  Department  of
Arts, Culture, Science and Technology.

With Government taking responsibility for  appointing  the  chairperson  and
the majority of the members of the council of Aisa, we will be in  a  better
position to ensure the appointment of a competent  council  to  promote  the
activities of Aisa against the  background  of  South  Africa's  interaction
with  the  rest  of  Africa.  Of  course,  members  are  aware  of  the  New
Partnership for Africa's Development, and Aisa will definitely  play  a  key
role in this regard.

In order to achieve these objectives, Aisa  is  required  by  this  Bill  to
investigate  matters  of  public  interest  and,  on  the  strength  of  its
findings, act in an opinion-forming and advisory manner. It  should  publish
scientific reports and other publications. It is placed under an  obligation
to promote outstanding achievements  in  the  different  fields  of  African
cultural life and to grant recognition for excellence.

Aisa is already involved in encouraging more extensive  coverage  of  Africa
in social science education. It will continue to generally promote  interest
in social science  education.  Globally  there  are  numerous  institutions,
networks and groups that study Africa. Aisa will have the responsibility  to
establish  reciprocal  arrangements  with  organisations   with   objectives
similar to its own, locally and abroad.

The major portion of its income will be derived from a parliamentary  grant,
but this is to be supplemented by  self-generated  funds  from  commissioned
contract  research  and  other  consultancy  services,  as  well   as   from
membership fees, donations from the corporate sector  and  income  from  the
sale of publications.

I think Aisa will succeed in its tasks. [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I thank the hon  the  Deputy  Minister  for
presenting the Bills in this House. We  wish  her  a  speedy  recovery.  She
introduced the Bills so thoroughly that I am definitely  not  going  to  use
all my time. The Africa Institute of South  Africa  Bill  provides  for  the
current section 21  company  to  become  an  associate  institution  of  the
Department of Arts, Culture,  Science  and  Technology,  to  provide,  among
other things, an anchor for the African Renaissance, as she  said,  the  NAI
and Map.

The only aspect I want  to  highlight  is  the  fact  that  the  arms-length
approach to prohibit centralising power and political interference,  and  to
prevent political interference in the operational aspects is upheld in  this
Bill.

We support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chair, it is my pleasure to speak on behalf of  the  opposition
on the Africa Institute of South Africa Bill. Before I do so,  I  also  wish
to hasten to convey to the hon the Deputy Minister a  wish  for  her  speedy
recovery from her surgery.

The Africa Institute is an information and research  centre  concerned  with
economic, social and political  issues  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.  It  is  an
independent,  nonprofit  association  serving  its  members,  who   comprise
individuals and institutions in South Africa and elsewhere.

The  institute  is  governed  by  representatives  of  the   South   African
universities, the Suid-Afrikaanse  Akademie  vir  Wetekenskap  en  Kuns  and
other broad interests. Findings and analyses are available  on  request  and
are  disseminated  through  a  library  service,  a  quarterly  journal  and
research reports. Members may attend lectures and conferences, consult  with
research staff and use the library and  bibliographical  service.  Corporate
members are entitled to in-depth briefing  by  institute  staff  and  gratis
reports.

The proposed Bill provides for the establishment, objectives  and  functions
of a juristic person known as the Africa Institute of SA, or Aisa.  Aisa  is
an autonomous, nonpartisan organisation, registered under section 21 of  the
Companies Act, 1973, as an association not for gain. The aim of the Bill  is
to establish Aisa as an institution with its own institution-specific Act.

The institution's main functions are  to  collect,  process,  interpret  and
disseminate information, findings  and  analyses  on  African  and  Southern
African affairs. By bringing Aisa into the family of science and  technology
institutions regulated by  institution-specific  Acts  administered  by  the
Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, firstly, the  necessary
interaction  promoting  multidisciplinary  approaches  will   be   enhanced;
secondly, the allocation of funds according to science  and  technology  and
national priorities will be promoted; thirdly, the Minister will be able  to
ensure the  appointment  of  an  appropriate  council;  and,  fourthly,  the
Minister will be able to guide and evaluate the activities of the  institute
in collaboration with the council of Aisa.

For any Government  department  to  carry  out  its  delivery  programme  at
optimum level, it is of paramount importance that such a department  be  fed
a nutritious diet of up-to-date information  and  scientific  data,  whether
the issues be economic, social or political.

In sub-Saharan Africa, some of the major issues that  currently  engage  the
public mind are, of course, the  African  Renaissance  and  the  New  Africa
Initiative - what these mean, in pragmatic terms, to  the  ordinary  citizen
of South Africa or indeed, Africa - and the  nature  and  scale  of  skilled
migration in Southern Africa - insights into skilled  people's  perspectives
on and experiences with emigration.

Regional peace and security is another subject needing elucidation. Much  of
the  debate  and  coverage  of  the  Democratic  Republic   of   Congo   has
concentrated on explaining the causes of the conflict  and  the  merits  and
demerits of the Lusaka Ceasefire  Accord,  but  neglects  the  post-conflict
reconstruction process, which is equally important. Right now  we  have  our
soldiers in Burundi trying to bring about peace.

These are some of the issues. A further issue I would like to talk about  is
the relevance of globalisation in our country which is still  embarrassingly
clothed in Third World garb.

There are various such matters and issues  that  need  research  and  expert
findings so that the  people  of  sub-Saharan  Africa  become  informed  and
knowledgeable. It is therefore institutions like the Africa Institute of  SA
that provide the necessary enlightenment on these vexed questions. My  party
supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister, hon  members,  since  it  was
established in 1960, the Africa Institute of SA  has  gone  through  various
phases, each roughly coinciding with  a  change  in  government  policy.  To
counter the international campaign to isolate South Africa,  the  government
of the day made systematic  efforts  to  forge  partnerships  with  friendly
African states.

The activities  of  Aisa  developed  within  the  context  of  the  colonial
paternalism that inspired those governments. However,  with  the  advent  of
democracy in South Africa, our Government realised the need for us as  South
Africans to look at Africa from within and in the context of our  experience
as part of a larger African  history  and  reality.  Hence  the  process  of
transformation and the tabling of this Bill before this House today.

Its preamble states:


  the Government of the  Republic  of  South  Africa  and  its  people  are
  committed to the revival and development of the African continent in  the
  twenty-first century.


  the transformation of the Africa Institute of  South  Africa,  which  has
  been set in motion by the review  process  of  the  Department  of  Arts,
  Culture, Science and Technology, continues to remove the  legacy  of  its
  apartheid past.

Its prime function will be  the  processing,  collecting  and  analysing  of
information relevant to Africa and its citizens, whilst at the same time  it
also undertakes all other activities which, in the opinion of  the  council,
are conducive to the achievement of the chief objectives of  the  institute.
In this respect Aisa's greatest asset is certainly  its  library.  While  it
contains a good general collection of Africana, it is especially  strong  in
the area of modern African politics and economics.
With regard to the composition of the council,  the  hon  the  Minister  has
already alluded to that, but allow me, in the context of this Department  of
Arts, Culture, Science and Technology debate, to  quote  from  the  hon  the
President Mr Mbeki's speech in 1996, which now  enjoys  pride  of  place  in
South African folklore (Debates of the Constitutional  Assembly,  1996,  col
422):


  I am an African. I owe my  being  to  the  hills  and  the  valleys,  the
  mountains and the  glades,  the  rivers,  the  deserts,  the  trees,  the
  flowers, the seas and the ever-changing seasons that define the  face  of
  our native land ...


  I owe my being to the Khoi and the San, whose desolate  souls  haunt  the
  great expanses of the beautiful Cape - they who fell victim to  the  most
  merciless genocide our native land has ever seen, they who were the first
  to  lose  their  lives  in  the  struggle  to  defend  our  freedom   and
  independence, and they who as a people perished in the result.

He went on to say:


  I am the child of Nongqause. I am he who made it possible to trade in the
  world markets in diamonds, in gold,  in  the  same  food  for  which  our
  stomachs yearn. I come from those transported from India and China  whose
  being resided in the  fact,  solely,  that  they  were  able  to  provide
  physical labour, who taught me that we could  both  be  at  home  and  be
  foreign, who taught me that human existence itself demanded that  freedom
  was a necessary condition for that human existence.


  Being part of all these people, and in  the  knowledge  that  none  dares
  contest that assertion, I shall claim that I am an African!

[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Chairperson,
once more let me begin  by  thanking  colleagues  for  contributing  to  the
content of the Bill by interrogating what was the initial draft. May I  also
say that Aisa is indeed posed to play a key role in Nepad  -  that  is,  the
New Partnership for Africa's Development.

If one looks at the content of the Bill, and thus  considers  the  ambit  of
its competency, there is no doubt that it  will  contribute  a  lot  to  the
generation  of  knowledge  and  creativity  and   promote   people-to-people
interaction,  here  on  our  continent;  that  is  South-South  with   other
developing countries, and between ourselves, our peoples and  those  of  the
northern hemisphere.

I am convinced that Aisa's time has come and that indeed  the  programme  of
Nepad will not be successful, nor can we talk about stimulating  creativity,
without an institution of this kind. We all know that next year  is  a  very
important year for our country. We will be hosting important events. We  are
hosting the coming into being of the African Union. May I say, according  to
the constitutive Act of the AU,  there  is  going  to  be  a  commission  on
culture. With the establishment of Aisa I can say without  doubt  that  this
will be a key player.

Mr Van Niekerk has reminded us  of  an  important  principle  for  enhancing
excellence in institutions of this kind, be they  cultural  institutions  or
scientific institutions, namely that of arm's length.  Arm's  length  is  an
important principle and it is embodied in our policy. The  only  problem  is
that  it  is  understood  and  interpreted  differently.  Sometimes  it   is
interpreted to mean being unaccountable. We have had interaction  with  some
cultural groupings which think they just have to have access  to  money  and
to do their thing and regard it as being creative.

Our democratic Constitution requires us to  be  accountable  and,  in  fact,
within the context of our Treasury regulations,  there  must  be  levels  of
accountability. I am happy that  our  colleague  has  reminded  us  of  this
principle. We should not lose sight of this  principle.  Indeed,  Aisa  must
operate at arm's length and interact with its  peers  and  represent  us  as
South Africans in that context. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                     CULTURAL LAWS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Consideration of Bill)
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL:  Chairperson,  I  am  going  to  provide  the
briefing today. Just to enlighten the House,  the  mediation  committee  was
duly established and met on Friday last week to consider the  amendments  of
the NCOP, which had been rejected by the NA. I am glad  to  report  to  this
House that of the many amendments that were  rejected,  approximately  seven
out of the nine were then approved, two of which in  a  somewhat  attenuated
form.

For the benefit of the House  I  would  just  reflect  on  one  particularly
important amendment which had been rejected and which seemed to be the  area
of dispute between the Houses - this was resolved in a very amicable  way  -
and that is the amendment that was proposed to clauses 6 and 10 of the  Bill
that had been passed by the NCOP. Originally clause 6 stated that after  the
report was tabled there would be a briefing to the committee of the NA.  The
NCOP proposed that it should be to both Houses and then there was  reference
made to the portfolio committee in  the  NA  and  the  Select  Committee  on
Education and Recreation in the NCOP. We resolved the matter  on  the  basis
that the Council  would  then  report  to  the  ``relevant  committees''  of
Parliament, including both Houses. We thought that it is important  that  we
do so, given the fact that culture itself is a concurrent competency and  is
something regarding which we as delegates have  to  convey  developments  to
our provinces.

There were other technical proposals that had been made by  the  NCOP  which
were rejected and were then  reconsidered  and  accepted  by  the  mediation
committee. As one of  the  co-chairs  of  the  mediation  committee,  I  was
satisfied that we gave due attention  to  the  amendments  proposed  by  the
NCOP. I would like to thank the members in the NCOP who participated in  the
mediation process for their support in  this  regard.  The  outcome  of  the
mediation process  was  one  that  was  satisfactory  to  both  Houses.  All
decisions were unanimous and  there  was  no  difficulty  in  resolving  the
matter within the period of an hour.

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  ESTABLISHMENT OF WORKING GROUP TO CONSIDER IMPLEMENTATION OF CONSTITUTIVE
                          ACT OF THE AFRICAN UNION

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council resolves that a working group be established to consider
  the implementation of the Constitutive Act of the African Union.
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, there is an  announcement
which is very sentimental. Mr Raju has lost a pen which was a  gift  to  him
from his late grandmother - hon  members,  listen  well  -  when  he  passed
matric in 1955. This is an appeal to hon members if anybody has come  across
it anywhere.

                              FAREWELL SPEECHES

Mr N M RAJU: Madam Chair, hon colleagues, it is my singular honour to  stand
up in this  august  House  on  behalf  of  the  main  and  only  substantial
opposition in Parliament, the  irrepressible  Democratic  Alliance,  to  say
farewell to colleagues and friends as the curtain comes down on an  eventful
parliamentary year. [Interjections.]

There is no doubt that the passing year has seen the NCOP elevate itself  to
a higher plain, both in the quality and substance of its  debates.  We  have
become a family, or have we?

Though as permanent delegates from the provinces that make  up  our  beloved
Republic we have often engaged in acrimonious debate, amid  sound  and  fury
reminiscent  of  a  poultry  auction,  we  have,   nevertheless,   conducted
ourselves with appropriate dignity and decorum.

I suspect that  the  impending  marriage  between  the  big  chief  and  the
blushing new bride, an event well  publicised  in  all  instruments  of  the
media,  will  result  in  future  deliberations   becoming   somewhat   more
cacophonous. Be that as it may, I am optimistic  that  however  tenuous  the
ensuing domestic bliss may be, our camaraderie will remain unaffected.

Parting is such sweet sorrow. As we return to our constituencies, our  homes
and hearths, we wish each other bon voyage. I say to  hon  members:  Have  a
safe journey, be good, love the  children,  respect  the  elders,  keep  the
faith, and till we meet again, goodbye. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I have to admit that it feels  as  if  this
year moved at the speed of lightning. Nevertheless, I want to say  farewell,
especially to the official opposition. Farewell. [Laughter.]

However, we had people supporting us in  making  this  upper  House  of  the
South African Parliament start to work for all the people,  and  I  want  to
thank them today. Firstly, I would like to thank the hon Chairperson  Naledi
Pandor for her strong leadership, which displays her vision  that  the  NCOP
shall work. To the Deputy Chairperson I would like to say thank you for  the
positive role he played in keeping us empowered and on track,  and  I  thank
him for his warmth as a human being.

To the Chair of Chairs, Senorita Ntlabati, you introduced a  report  on  the
position of legislation. We thank  you  for  it  and  for  what  you  do  in
general.

To the programming Whip, the provincial Whips and fellow  party  Whips  with
their support staff, we want  to  thank  them  for  the  co-operation  which
contributed towards a year in which this  House  established  itself  as  an
institution to be reckoned with.

The Chief Whip, the hon Enver Surty, is an example to all of  us,  not  just
of  dedication,  hard  work  and  diplomacy,  but   also   of   constructive
involvement. That is what we need in South Africa. Some of the members  will
not understand that. Thank you for that, Enver. [Interjections.]

We want to thank the Secretariat, Hansard,  the  interpreting  services  and
the sound operators out there who had many difficulties at  times.  However,
we know it will go better next year in the new Chamber.

Lastly, the service personnel,  we  thank  them  for  their  enthusiasm  and
smiles. They make our lives easier. I give a special word of  thanks  to  Mr
Harrison on  my  right.  Mr  Harrison  is  turning  70,  and  the  Rules  of
Parliament say he has to take leave at 70, but he  is  a  young  70,  and  I
think that is unfair. After 13 years of service to  Parliament,  he  retires
at the end of the month. We wish him well, and  I  wish  to  hand  him  this
medallion, that portrays Parliament, in  recognition  and  appreciation  for
what he did during his time at Parliament. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Happy birthday!

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: To conclude, to the  quiet  but  always  there  security
personnel, I thank them for being here and securing our safety.

I, as a Christian, wish all Christians a blessed festive time  and  may  the
peace and grace of Christ be not only with the Christians, but with  all  of
us. Nkosi sikelela, South  Africa.  ``!ke  e:/xarra//ke.''  [Diverse  people
unite.] [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon members, we meet to  part,  and  part  to
meet. At this present moment we are doing exactly that.  It  has  been  hard
working all year round in this House. I wish  all  members  a  safe  journey
home - I repeat, all members - and a good life with their families, a  happy
Christmas time and a prosperous New Year, 2002.

Besihlezi kahle, sisebenza kahle futhi  sibambisene  kahle.  Nalabo  abekade
beklwebhana  abaqedananga.  Kumnandi  ukuhlangana   kwabantu   abathandanayo
nabezwanayo okuthi noma bephikisana kube  ngukwakhana,  ukwakha  izwe  lethu
iNingizimu Afrika esilithandayo sonke. Sengathi iNkosi  umnini  mandla  onke
angahamba nathi, umusa wakhe ube phezu kwethu nemindeni yethu size  sibonane
futhi  ngonyaka   ozayo.   Hambani   kahle   emuseni   weNkosi!   [Ihlombe.]
(Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[We have been staying well, working well and co-operating.  Even  those  who
scratched one another did not destroy one another. It is  nice  when  people
who like one another get together, and find that  when  they  criticise  one
another, they do it in a constructive manner so  as  to  build  our  beloved
country, South Africa. May God be with all of you, and may His  grace  dwell
on your families until we meet again next year. In the name  of  God  I  say
goodbye! [Applause.]]

Mr H T SOGONI: Chairperson, hon members, work and no  rest  would  certainly
make the life of a parliamentarian miserable and unbearable,  just  as  work
and no play makes John a dull boy.

We need complete rest,  and  we  look  forward  to  a  happy  Christmas  and
prosperous New Year for all. To our presiding officers, ably led by the  hon
Naledi Pandor, the UDM wishes to extend a sincere word  of  thanks  for  the
satisfactory manner in which they conducted  the  business  of  this  House.
Like the star that her first name indicates, the presiding officer has  lead
this House by her example of hard work, honesty,  efficiency  and  effective
leadership.

The UDM conveys similar commendations  to  hon  Adv  Mushwana,  hon  members
Senorita Ntlabati and Bhengu, without whom the presiding officer  would  not
have managed to run this House so efficiently  -  without  their  collective
and dedicated efforts to make things happen.

The UDM further notes with sincere appreciation the sterling performance  of
the Chief Whip hon Surty, the Chair of Committees,  Senorita  Ntlabati,  the
chairpersons of Select Committees and our hon provincial Whips. Please,  hon
leaders, continue to demonstrate the professionalism with which  you  always
approach your duties!

To hon individual members of the House, the UDM says:

Bekumnandi ukusebenza  nani  kunyaka  ka-2001,  beninomoya  wobulali,  umoya
wobuntu noumoya wobudlelwane. Ningaphezi nakulo nyaka ozayo.  [Working  with
you in 2001 was nice. You had both spirits, the human spirit and the  animal
spirit. Continue like this next year.]

In wishing all members a good festive season, I wish to add  to  the  voices
of so many who always warn us that Aids kills and road accidents  have  over
past festive seasons always accounted for a terrible loss of  life.  Let  us
therefore go out to preach and practise  the  gospel  of  ABC  in  order  to
contain the HIV/Aids pandemic. Let the Arrive Alive campaign be part of  our
constituency work, in order to contribute to the national efforts to  reduce
the number of deaths on our roads.

In conclusion ...

Sikhulule siyobonana nomama nobaba side sibuye sihlangane.  [Ihlombe.]  [Let
us be free so that we can go and meet with our  fathers  and  mothers  until
next year when we come back. [Applause.]]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, hon House, saying farewell, as  usual,  brings
about mixed feelings. One is usually  looking  forward  with  anxiety  to  a
homeward journey and to those that one loves, but at the same  time  one  is
also finding it difficult to part with those  that  one  got  accustomed  to
living with.

We have lived together as members of a broad family, and  in  spite  of  our
different political affiliations, we have learnt to  work  together  and  to
love each other. We shall undoubtedly miss each other during  the  next  two
months.

We are proud of our leadership in the NCOP, the Chairperson, a  very  strict
and capable lady with a very pleasant and likable  disposition;  the  Deputy
Chairperson ...

Mogaetsho! re a go rata, o re tswale fela jalo. [Fellow countryman! We  love
you, keep it up.]

...  and  the  Chief  Whip,  a  gentle,  down-to-earth  man  of   unequalled
benevolence. [Interjections.]

As we take leave of one another today, I wish every one of  us  Godspeed,  a
happy Christmas period and a prosperous New Year. May the  good  Lord  bless
you until we meet again.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I have this unusual situation  of  having  equal
time with everybody ... [Interjections.] ... and I feel like a  fox  terrier
that has caught the bus, and then when the bus stops the dog does  not  know
what to do.

I can only say that today is the day of tolerance, as a matter of  fact  the
International Day of Tolerance. I think that if there is one attribute  that
this House has and should have, and should work at and preserve, it is  that
attribute of  tolerance,  of  respecting  each  other  and  respecting  each
other's point of view, which lies at the heart of tolerance. If  I  may  say
so, with all the divorce proceedings that are  being  proposed  between  the
parties ... [Interjections.] ... and new marriages ...

Mense vry na mekaar, mnr die Voorsitter. [People are courting  one  another,
Mr Chairman.]

I only want to say that it is our duty not to ascribe  bad  motives  to  our
colleagues. Whatever they decide in their wisdom,  we  should  accept  their
views. We may disagree profoundly with them, but we should not  ascribe  bad
motives to them.

Being tolerant, of course, does not mean that we must not be  intolerant  of
mediocrity, of racism, of tyrants and of those who would  abuse  the  rights
of our citizens. There are those that would abuse the tolerance and  freedom
that exist in our society, but we must not do that.

What remains for me to do,  is  to  thank  the  Chairperson,  the  presiding
officers, the parliamentary staff, and the  service  staff  that  make  life
easy and convenient for us and always do things with a smile. We thank  them
for that. We wish you all Godspeed,  a  merry  Christmas  and  may  you  all
return safely. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, much has been said.  What  I  do
believe is that the House has reflected in the past few months, and  perhaps
the past two years, a new kind of political realignment  that  this  country
needs so much, given the fact that we are so diverse. I think what  we  have
achieved in this House, which is quite unusual and distinctive, is the  fact
that when discussing matters of  public  importance,  we  have  collectively
been able to achieve consensus and resolve to move forward in  a  particular
way. That is quite remarkable and extraordinary.

I also think - and the President has, in fact, commented on this - that  the
nature of our discourse and debate in this  House  is  unique  and  somewhat
commendable. I would like to say this would not have been  possible  had  it
not been for the kind of disposition and participation  by  all  members  of
the NCOP. I think we have a new spirit  and,  notwithstanding  the  divorces
and divisions and co-operation that may well occur, the spirit  amongst  the
members of this House reflects a certain kind of way forward.

This is a day to say farewell, and we obviously do so by thinking  of  those
members who have made this year a very successful  one.  We  will  obviously
have to start with the presiding officers - Ms Pandor, you, Ms Ntlabati  and
Mr Bhengu - who have really given this House the appropriate  leadership.  I
have to recognise the important role of the Whippery -  of  all  the  Whips,
who have again moved together in unison, with decisions  taken  collectively
by consensus. Again, this reflects a particular nature that we have  in  the
NCOP.

I have to recognise the contribution of  the  Secretary  to  the  NCOP,  the
Table staff and all members of staff who  have  assisted,  Hansard  and  the
interpretation services, the service personnel who have been kind enough  to
provide us with water and circulate messages in the  House  under  difficult
circumstances and the media, who have assisted maybe somewhat partially,  in
promoting or enhancing the profile of the NCOP.  I  say  thank  you  to  all
members for having helped us through a difficult but very successful year.

It is also the new year for the Hindu community, who  celebrated  Diwali  on
Wednesday and Thursday. It is important that we wish them well  in  the  new
year, that is Mr Raju and the Hindu community as a whole. We also  have  the
commencement of Ramadan tomorrow and we wish all the Muslims in  this  House
and the whole country well over the holy period of Ramadan. We believe  that
all the members who are present in the House will be  fasting  as  they  are
accustomed to doing. Mr Moosa is nodding in agreement. I know  it  is  going
to be a strenuous time, but it is also a time to think about those  who  are
less privileged, the indigent and the poor.

We then have the festive period, when people will be celebrating  Christmas,
and we have the new year  celebrations.  We  wish  the  community  of  South
Africa well during the festive period. It is important that we  remember  to
drive very carefully and to support the Arrive Alive campaign that has  been
launched by the Government.

I must conclude by saying: Tsamayang sentle, ke a leboga. [Go well, I  thank
you.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Thank you,  hon  Chief
Whip and hon members, for all the good words - words of  courage  and  words
of wisdom. One needs to say again that the parliamentary session has  ended.
I think I would be correct to say that it has been a  successful  year,  and
hon members have been instrumental in and part and parcel of  that  success.
I think we deserve a round of applause from ourselves. [Applause.]

As we close, it is proper to thank the Chief Whip and his Whips,  the  Chair
of Chairs, and chairpersons of select committees  and  in-house  committees.
As we know, the  select  committees  are  the  engines  of  Parliament.  The
success or failure of Parliament depends on the chairpersons of the  various
committees and we  commend  them  for  the  sterling  work  they  performed,
failing which we would not have succeeded.

I thank all hon members for having been honest and for their  dedication  to
their work for which they were elected. We know that members went through  a
number of difficulties because of numbers. Members had to shuttle  from  one
committee to another, and sometimes committee meetings clashed. It was  very
difficult, but you made it!

We would like to thank the Table  staff  for  their  continuous  advice  and
assistance and for making it possible for us to meet. We thank  the  service
officers, who gave us water every time we asked for it, enabling us to  make
the necessary noise and to interrupt one another at times.

We need to thank  the  Hansard  staff,  the  media  and  the  interpretation
personnel. We  thank  the  Secretary  to  the  NCOP  and  the  Secretary  to
Parliament for their excellent administration. It has not  been  very  easy,
but rather very difficult, so we are glad that they managed to  handle  this
difficult task with precision.

We left our families behind. We were separated, although we did not want  to
be, and we had little time to spend with our family members. In  some  cases
it has been noted that relations have been  strained  because  of  our  long
separation. They needed our guidance, comfort and company and  we  were  not
there. Now is our time to be with them, and let us make use  of  this  time.
Please, hon members, extend our  sincerest  thanks  and  gratitude  to  your
families for the support they have been giving you,  because  we  know  that
without that support, the success that we are talking about today would  not
exist. Therefore, tell your families  to  continue  to  perform  this  noble
task.

In the same way we left our constituencies in limbo. We were not there,  and
therefore let us utilise the period set aside for our constituency work  for
that purpose. In our constituencies, we need to tell our people what  we  as
members have been doing in Parliament. They elected us, and so we also  need
to receive new mandates from these constituencies. While we were away,  some
of our members might have passed away, or lost their loved  ones,  and  some
might be going through very difficult times. Where  we  can,  let  us  visit
them, let us comfort them, let us share their difficulties if we can.

We know that Aids is wreaking havoc; it is  devastating  the  lives  of  our
people. I know that we, as members of Parliament,  can  make  a  difference.
Can we please go back to our constituencies  and  make  that  difference  by
assisting where we can.

In this House we may have had our own differences and  difficulties,  and  I
think we must differ, otherwise the world would consist of one  personality.
Maybe if those differences spice up our lives, then we  should  enjoy  them.
On the other hand, if those differences are meant to destroy  our  fledgling
democracy, then we must fight hard to stop those differences.

We cannot afford to  lose  that  democracy,  which  was  very  difficult  to
achieve. History cannot be changed and we must not  attempt  to  change  it.
The differences that we may have had  in  the  past  will  remain  and  they
cannot be changed. However, they will determine how we behave  now  and  how
we behave in the future. They will tell us what it is  that  we  can  repeat
and what we cannot. Therefore, let us not try to change history.

In conclusion, I  do  not  know  how  many  of  us  have  ever  thought  how
privileged we are in a country of 40 million people to  find  ourselves  the
select few in this Chamber to represent the 40 million people. And I  wonder
how many of us have tried hard enough to give back  to  the  community,  the
people that brought us  into  this  Chamber  to  represent  the  40  million
people. We must be exemplary.

We must also enjoy our festive season. On behalf of the presiding  officers,
I say bon voyage until we meet next year. Let us all  go  and  have  a  good
rest. With those few words the House is adjourned. [Applause.]

The Council adjourned at 11:22.
