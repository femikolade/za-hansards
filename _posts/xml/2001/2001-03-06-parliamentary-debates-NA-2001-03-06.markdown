                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr M S BOOI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that South African Muslims celebrated Eid-ul-Adhu Gaa on Monday
       5 and Tuesday 6 March 2001, marking the end of the hadj, or Islamic
       holy pilgrimage to Makkah, undertaken by millions of Muslims
       worldwide, including many thousands of South Africans;


  (2) congratulates all pilgrims on completing their religious obligations
       dutifully, and wishes them a hadj makbul [may Allah grant them all
       acceptance of their hadj]; and


  (3) wishes all Muslims across the world and in South Africa,/ in
       particular, a happy and joyous Eid.

[Applause.]

Mr N J CLELLAND: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes outrageous and laughable claims by Zimbabwe's Justice Minister
       Patrick Chinamasa that -


       (a)  the Leader of the Opposition, the hon Tony Leon, travelled to
           Zimbabwe to ``drive a wedge'' between Zimbabweans;


       (b)  the DA was ``linking up'' with white commercial farmers to
           encourage them to resist ``lawful government'' action; and


       (c)  the DP was even offering to pay to bring down the  government
           ...

[Interjections.]


  (2) notes that the Zimbabwean Justice Minister obviously has the same
       regard for the truth that he has for his own judiciary;


  (3) further notes that the South African Government has still done
       nothing tangible to assist the people of Zimbabwe and Zimbabwean
       civil society; and


  (4) resolves that President Mbeki make a more visible effort to encourage
       President Mugabe and his government to maintain democracy, the rule
       of law and basic human rights in Zimbabwe.

[Interjections.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) mourns the death of seven commuters, including children, who were
       caught up in the stampede at Johannesburg Park Station;


  (2) is amazed to learn that security guards locked the gates at the Park
       Station 10 minutes before departure time, which was uncalled for, and
       did not open the gates even when the stampede was noticeable; and


  (3) calls upon the Department of Transport to conduct a full
       investigation into the matter.

Dr S C CWELE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Chief Whip of the ANC, Comrade Tony Yengeni, met a
       delegation from Zanu-PF yesterday;


  (2) believes that this provides an opportunity for this House to
       encourage a peaceful dialogue, co-operation and common purpose
       between the Zanu-PF, the MDC and other political parties; and


  (3) commends the Chief Whip of the ANC for meeting with these parties,
       and encourages further dialogue with these parties to find a peaceful
       and sustainable solution which will strengthen democracy and human
       rights in Zimbabwe.

[Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the irresponsible and sexist comments made by Minister Steve
       Tshwete in the Eastern Cape last weekend that most criminals are
       women;


  (2) further notes that this is the second time the Minister, in his
       recent statements, has unjustifiably degraded women, as occurred last
       year at the Women's Day celebrations when the Minister accused white
       women of using the day to relax and shop rather than attend
       celebrations;


  (3) points out that, according to the latest available statistics, women
       make up only approximately 12% of all convicted criminals and less
       than 1% of violent criminals, and only 2,5% of the total prison
       population comprises women;


  (4) calls on the Minister to motivate his remarks with concrete evidence;


  (5) notes that since the Minister recently stated that the current
       moratorium on crime statistics was due to incorrect data analysis,
       one wonders whether the Minister has access to new statistics or
       information which he would like to share with the House; and


  (6) urges the Minister to apologise and to stop making wild, inaccurate
       statements, targeting sections of the community, unless he can prove
       their validity.

[Applause.]

Ms N G W BOTHA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the DA-controlled Cape Town City Council cut the water supply of
           many families in Macassar on the Cape Flats;


       (b)  in the rest of democratic South Africa, access to clean water is
           recognised as a priority basic human right; and


       (c)  Macassar, Tafelsig, Guguletu, Langa, etc, are mainly poor areas
           which must benefit most from the provision of free basic
           services;


  (2) believes that the DA is deliberately targeting the poor, particularly
       those in areas which voted for the ANC;


  (3) condemns this brutal act; and


  (4) calls on the DA to honour the promises it made to provide free
       services to all the people of Cape Town.

[Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) for the first time a vote was taken in the Standing Committee on
       Public Accounts last week where the majority party proposed a motion
       stating that nowhere had the committee's original report provided for
       the definite inclusion of the Heath Special Investigating Unit in the
       investigation into arms procurement; and


  (2) by voting in favour of this motion, the ANC has made it clear that it
       will use its majority to defend the executive even where an
       alternative reasonable interpretation of the facts was possible and,
       in so doing, has compromised the independence and oversight role of
       the Standing Committee on Public Accounts and Parliament itself.

[Interjections.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem van die Minister van Onderwys, mnr Kader Asmal, se
       aankondiging gister van 'n nasionale plan vir hoër onderwys;


  (2) saamstem met die voorstel dat tersiêre instellings elkeen sy eie
       nismark moet bepaal ten einde onnodige duplisering uit te skakel;


  (3) meen dat hierdie bepaling van nismarkte ook voorsiening daarvoor moet
       maak dat daar 'n besliste behoefte aan universiteite is wat as
       hoofsaaklik Afrikaanse instansies gesien moet word;
  (4) erken dat die keuse om hoofsaaklik Afrikaans te wees nie beteken dat
       sodanige universiteite op enige wyse teen ander mense op grond van
       ras of geslag mag diskrimineer nie; en


  (5) van mening is dat daar so gou moontlik duidelikheid oor hierdie sake
       moet kom omdat dit tans by alle tersiêre instellings groot
       onsekerheid oor hulle voortbestaan skep.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes yesterday's announcement by the Minister of Education, Mr Kader
       Asmal, about a national plan for higher education;


  (2) agrees with the proposal that each tertiary institution should
       determine its own niche market in order to eliminate unnecessary
       duplication;


  (3) is of the opinion that such a determination of niche markets should
       also make provision for a definite need for universities that are to
       be regarded as predominantly Afrikaans institutions;


  (4) concedes that the option of being predominantly Afrikaans does not
       imply that such universities may discriminate in any way against
       other people on the grounds of race or gender; and


  (5) is of the opinion that clarity on these matters should be reached as
       soon as possible, because it is currently creating a great deal of
       uncertainty at all tertiary institutions as regards their continued
       existence.]

Mr D V BLOEM: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs
       and Tourism held a working meeting in Guguletu;


  (2) further notes that the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism,
       Mr Valli Moosa, announced at this meeting that his department had set
       aside R66 million to establish 200 black-owned enterprises in the
       tourism industry;


  (3) believes that the portfolio committee, together with the Minister,
       has set an important example of holding meetings and events of
       national importance in historically disadvantaged areas; and


  (4) commends the Minister and the committee for spearheading this
       initiative, and calls on other Ministers and committees to emulate
       their example.

[Applause.]

Mr C W EGLIN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes former President Mandela's statesmanly contributions towards a
       national consensus and common nationhood in his interviews with two
       South African newspapers last week;


  (2) endorses Mr Mandela's observation that opposition voices criticise
       because of their legitimate concerns for and their pride in South
       Africa, and that these criticisms are often motivated by patriotism;
       and


  (3) calls on the ANC and the Government to accept the advice given by Mr
       Mandela when he called for open debate and tolerance of political
       differences as a major challenge and focus for 2001.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -
  (1) notes -


       (a)  the importance of clarity for purposes of financial
           accountability;


       (b)  the provision of Aids funding via conditional grants to
           provinces; and


       (c)  the lack of local capacity and the failure of several provinces
           to fully distribute their Aids grants; and


  (2) calls on the Ministers of Finance, of Education, of Health and of
       Welfare to supply us, the Members of Parliament, and the members of
       the public with clear strategies concerning -


       (a)  the way in which conditional grants are disbursed at local
           level;


       (b)  whom they can be accessed from in each province; and


       (c)  exactly what requirements must be met before they can be
           accessed, and to supply a model of business plans that must be
           submitted so that we can immediately improve access to poverty
           relief funds and supportive programmes for the poorest of the
           poor.

Mr F BHENGU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that another American teenager has gone on the rampage and used
       a gun to shoot at fellow pupils;


  (2) further notes that the DP, the New NP and others have consistently
       opposed attempts by this Government to free South Africa of guns; and


  (3) calls on the DP and its partners to admit their mistake and to stop
       their opposition to gun control.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]
Mr J SCHIPPERS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  entrepreneurship is South Africa's only solution to sustainable
           long-term job creation; and


       (b)  South Africa's most successful young entrepreneur and
           distinguished member of President Mbeki's International Task
           Force, Mark Shuttleworth, has left SA for the UK; and


  (2) urges the Government to undertake a serious reassessment of its
       policies and to commit itself to ensuring the safety and security of
       all South Africans, because South Africa can ill-afford to lose more
       and more of its young entrepreneurs.

Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:
  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay the fact that schools catering for approximately 10
       000 school children in the Mount Ayliff region have not yet received
       their textbooks and learning material;


  (2) condemns this unacceptable state of affairs in the strongest possible
       terms as an injustice perpetrated against our children and their
       future; and


  (3) calls on the Minister of Education and the MEC for education in the
       Eastern Cape to attend to the matter as a matter of extreme urgency.

Ms B O DLAMINI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  masses of people in South Africa and abroad have held massive
           demonstrations supporting the Government's stance on the
           importation of affordable drugs; and;


       (b)  this deadly disease is a scourge which afflicts the poorest of
           the poor;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  pharmaceutical companies are putting profits ahead of people's
           wellbeing; and


       (b)  this immorality will induce a permanent struggle between the
           people and the pharmaceutical companies, which can only be won
           by the people; and


  (3) commends our people and the international community for embarking on
       actions which support the Government's efforts to make drugs cheaper
       and accessible to the poor.

[Applause.]
Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with keen interest that, according to the South African
       Yearbook Report for 2000-01, the agricultural sector contributes only
       4% to the gross domestic product of the South African economy;


  (2) notes, however, with shock and dismay, the collapse of agricultural
       and rural development agencies in this country, with specific
       reference to the Northern Province Agricultural and Rural Development
       Corporation, which are on the brink of ruin;


  (3) is concerned about the collapse of large agricultural projects,
       forestry plantations, and citrus estates such as the Zebediela citrus
       estate in the Northern Province, which is one of the largest citrus
       estates in the world and which contributes to the economic growth of
       South Africa;


  (4) is alarmed at the attitude of some provincial governments, in
       particular that of the Northern Province, which ignores concerns
       expressed over issues which involve the people and the economic
       development of the country; and


  (5) calls on the Northern Province MEC for agriculture and the Minister
       for Agriculture and Land Affairs to address the concerns raised by
       political parties in the Northern Province legislature concerning the
       collapse of the agricultural and rural development corporation ...

                  ADVISORY BOARD ON SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker, I thank you for the
opportunity to address the National Assembly on the occasion of the Second
Reading of the Advisory Board on Social Development Bill.

The Bill is another milestone in our effort to institutionalise the
partnership between civil society and Government. This partnership is
focused on eradicating poverty and ensuring people-centred, sustainable
development in our country.

With regard to the social development sector, the Bill has two key
objectives: Firstly, to create an authentic partnership between civil
society and Government in policy development, service delivery and
programme monitoring. Secondly, to ensure that this partnership enhances co-
operative governance by working with local government to address social
development needs. The Bill is evidence of our commitment to eradicating
the painful common legacy of our past and building unity in action for
change.

In outlining to Parliament Government's programme of action for the year
2001, President Mbeki stated:


  ... the success of these plans (the rural development strategy and the
  urban renewal programme) will also depend on the extent to which the
  people can be mobilised so that they become active participants in the
  processes targeted at the upliftment of their own communities.

The partnership between civil society and Government in the social
development sector is not an end in itself. This Bill seeks to create a
permanent mechanism for social mobilisation and constituency building in
poverty eradication and welfare service provision.

The Bill is fundamentally about entrenching participation and ensuring
accountability, by creating a representative board to advise the Minister
and acting as a consultative forum on social policy. It is, however,
noteworthy that the Bill assigns a proactive role to the board and requires
clear lines of communication with the parliamentary committees on social
development in the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces.


Today, as the National Assembly debates the Advisory Board on Social
Development Bill, we should take pride in the fact that the principles of
participation and accountability informed the entire process of formulating
the Bill. In this regard, I would like to acknowledge the early work done
by the National Interim Consultative Committee on Developmental Social
Services.

I would also like to thank the Portfolio Committee on Social Development in
the National Assembly and the organisations that made presentations during
the public hearings of the Bill. Throughout the process of drafting and
amending the Bill, we have all kept uppermost in our minds, our
constituents, the poor, marginalised and vulnerable people in our society.
This single-mindedness and our efforts at consensus building are reflected
in the widespread support that exists for the Bill.

I would like to appeal to the members of the civil society that are
appointed to the Advisory Board on Social Development to emulate this
single-mindedness. They will be appointed to represent our constituents,
the poor, marginalised and vulnerable people in our society, not particular
sectors of the social development practice.

The objectives of the Bill are, in the first instance, to advise the
Minister on measures to promote the transformation and continuous
improvement of social development services, measures to promote social
development initiatives, measures to include local government in the
provision of welfare services, measures to enhance the provision of
integrated service delivery at local government level, proposals for new
legislative frameworks for the social development sector and amendments to
existing legislation, and, finally, the entrenching of local and
international good practices in social development services.

In the second instance, the objectives of the board are to function as a
consultative forum for the Minister. It will discuss matters that will
include ways of improving the quality of provincial and national social
development activities. Secondly, it will introduce new policy requirements
and regimes in the governmental and nongovernmental spheres of social
development work.

Thirdly, it will seek ways of facilitating consultation between
stakeholders and Government on the implementation of social development
programmes. Fourthly, it will seek ways of ensuring the effective review
and evaluation of social development policies, programmes and legislation
as informed by the needs and priorities of society. Finally, it will seek
ways of collating inputs from the social development sector for the
international forums and protocols.

As is the case with other statutory boards, the board will be required to
adhere to and deliver on the objectives set out in the legislation. The
Minister of Social Development will be responsible for ensuring that the
board has sufficient resources to effectively perform its duties.

As I stated at the beginning of my address, the Advisory Board on Social
Development Bill is another milestone in institutionalising the partnership
between NGOs and Government. However, determining the vitality of this
partnership requires that we examine three other sets of issues. Firstly,
the existence of an enabling legislative environment and the funding of
NGOs. Secondly, the establishment of targets, standards and indicators and,
thirdly, Government's expectation of NGOs in the context of constructive
regionalism.

Significant progress has been made in reforming the policy and legislative
environment in which nonprofit organisations operate. There is now also
better co-ordination between the initiatives of various Government
departments. The Nonprofit Organisations Act is in its second year of
implementation. To date, more than 4 800 new organisations not previously
in receipt of fundraising authority have applied for registration.

The Taxation Laws Amendment Act of 2000 makes it easier for a wider range
of NGOs to benefit from a preferential tax status and NPO registration is
included in the qualifying criteria for both tax and national lottery
benefits. The increasing number of applications for registration, in terms
of the Nonprofit Organisations Act, seems to vindicate the current policy
of self-regulation and optional registration.

There are, however, a number of outstanding issues that still need to be
addressed. These include improving the marketing of the registration
process, the provision of increased incentives for registered
organisations, programmes to enable community-based organisations to meet
NPO reporting requirements, the generation of better information on the NGO
sector and securing the funding of nonprofit causes.
With respect to both the funding of NGOs and the promotion of a dialogue
between civil society and Government, the experience of the National
Development Agency will be instructive. Much rides on its success. The
success of the poverty eradication programme, particularly in the rural
areas, will depend to a large extent on the active participation and
involvement of traditional leaders, churches and local authorities.

Another key issue is the targets and norms with which we measure social
programmes. At the international level, efforts are under way to codify the
principles of good practice in social policy. This has to be complemented
by the active participation of civil society in the development of
indicators and standards that are appropriate to the South African context.

The Government, as part of its commitment to an outcomes-based and cost-
sensitive budgeting regime, is setting standards and costing the norms in
the delivery of social services. In the coming years, these various efforts
will converge and constitute a vital component of any form of antipoverty
pact.

I am convinced that in order to be successful the focus of all these
efforts has to be broader than South Africa. The Government is committed to
constructive regionalism and supports efforts to increase the involvement
of NGOs in social development issues in the Southern Africa Development
Community. The assigning of the memorandum of understanding between the
SADC and the SADC Council of NGOs will be an important milestone in this
effort.

The basic twin expectations of Government are that NGOs will, firstly,
continue to act as monitors of the public good and safeguard the interests
of the disadvantaged sections of society. This performance of this social
watching role requires both transparency and accountability on the part of
the NGOs.

The Government's second expectation is that NGOs will assist in expanding
access to social and economic services that create jobs and eradicate
poverty among the poorest of the poor. This requires cost-effective and
sustainable service delivery.

I would like to conclude my comments on the Advisory Board of Social
Development Bill by thanking all stakeholders, partners and parliamentary
committees who continue to work with my Ministry in eradicating poverty and
ensuring people-centred, sustainable development. Special mention among
these should be the religious groups, especially the churches: the
Methodist, Catholic, Presbyterian, independent churches and, more
importantly, the Muslim community, specifically in the Western Cape.

I assure the House of the Government's commitment to an ongoing dialogue
and partnership with civil society. [Applause.]

Mr E SALOOJEE: Madam Speaker and hon members, South Africa inherited, from
our past, a situation of social instability. This manifests in
dysfunctional families which in turn results in children being abused and
neglected, human beings subjected to violence and degradation and older
persons with disabilities being marginalised. The ability of communities to
maintain cohesion has been seriously eroded, and this is the result of the
devastating policies of the past.

As the economy gains momentum, the challenges ahead of us are also
increasingly shifting towards a social sphere. We need to come up with
innovative strategies to deal with such social challenges. That the ANC is
willing to face such challenges cannot be doubted. But, in order to
succeed, we need the full co-operation and support of participants in the
social development sector to assist in analysing the challenges in their
full contexts and to find lasting solutions.

This is the importance of the Bill before the House today. The Bill deals
precisely with the relationship between Government and civil society and,
in essence, sets out the formalisation of a basis for a very real
partnership and real dialogue between the Minister and stakeholders in the
sector. As the Minister has already pointed out, it aims to establish a
body that will advise him on crucial social development matters. The board
will also provide a forum for consultation between the Government and civil
society on the progress we are making as a nation in realising the goals of
a better life for all.

The objective of the Advisory Board on Social Development is not to replace
partnerships already in existence. It aims to bring together a group of
people whose work and experiences with a whole range of communities,
marginalised by decades of underdevelopment and neglect, are of such a
nature that the Minister is able to draw on that insight in an effective
and concentrated way.

More importantly, the Bill provides for the establishment of an advisory
body that will be the opposite of many statutory and regulatory bodies from
the past, bodies concerned only with the welfare of the minority. From our
side, we are proud to say that the Bill represents yet another small but
critical step in the transformation process that the ANC began during the
first Parliament.

While establishing an advisory board, the Bill seeks to abolish the now-
defunct South African Welfare Council. We should remember that that council
still exists, and that it would have to be removed. Allow me to reflect
briefly on where we come from in order to highlight to members how
important this new body will be. The SA Welfare Council served as an organ
of the old apartheid system's policies and its role was essentially to
carry out programmes that entrenched racial inequalities. In fact, it has
often been suggested that elements of the Broederbond deeply influenced the
work of that council.

The council provided strategic advice to the government on key social
issues that were central to the advancement of the apartheid plan, to the
disadvantage of the majority. One needs only to think of the plainly racist
population control programmes of the 1970's and 80's that emanated as a
direct result of this council's influence on the welfare sector. Such
policies focused on demographics rather than human development, and we are
still living with the legacy of that approach.

What is also important to remember about the council is that many of its
policy recommendations were based on estimations of population size and
incorrect assumptions about the nature of families and communities in which
African people lived. It is clear that the SA Welfare Council was not in
touch with civil society. In fact, it was comprised of a highly isolated
and yet highly influential group of people.

This is not the ANC's way of doing things. We have actively been pursuing
partnerships with nongovernmental, community-based and faith-based
organisations, not only to deliver services, but also to contribute to the
formulation of policy that is responsive to our people's needs. This is not
a coincidence. For the first time, we have a Government that is really
interested in listening to people.

We are not listening only to people in the cities, but we are deliberately
reaching out to the rural communities. The Bill is quite specific about
ensuring a geographic spread of members appointed to the board. The passing
of this Bill therefore forms a further part of the setting into operation
of the integrated rural development strategy.

The approach to be followed with the advisory board needs to be framed
within the shift that has taken place under the leadership of the ANC, away
from providing welfare services that engender dependency, to delivering
services that are focused in a much more holistic manner on developmental
needs. We do not intend for our people to remain dependent. We are
committed to providing the policy framework and critical services that will
enable and empower individuals and communities to become self-reliant.

Earlier I referred to the old SA Welfare Council. Despite the democratic
changes that have taken place in South Africa and the transformation
impetus we have created, many of the formal welfare sector organisations
have also not fundamentally transformed themselves.

In this country, we have 26 national councils - national councils for the
blind, mental health, the aged, etc - all of whom have powerful formal
positions in the sector. As the ANC, we must ensure that the consultation
that takes place through the board does not merely reflect the interests of
the formal social development sector, but that it provides the myriad of
smaller organisations with an avenue for real dialogue with the decision-
makers. We shall now reach out to a range of organisations, especially in
the rural areas, to get a deeper understanding of social development needs.

Our Minister has taken the very important step to ensure that the
partnership between his department and the social development sector is
strengthened, and we congratulate the Minister on his initiatives. We trust
that the new Advisory Board on Social Development will further enhance the
dialogue and spirit of partnership between Government and the social
development sector.

Finally, I wish to thank those members of the committee who have
contributed to the shaping of the amending Bill we have before the House
today. I trust that they will, when asked by the Minister to do so, make
recommendations regarding the appointment of members to the board, and
apply themselves with the same commitment to ensuring that the board
represents the real interests of all South Africans. [Applause.]

Mev P W CUPIDO: Mevrou die Speaker, agb lede van hierdie Huis en kiesers
wat elke middag getrou voor die televisie sit om te luister hoe politici
ons land se sake bestuur, die Departement van Maatskaplike Ontwikkeling,
wat voorheen die Departement van Welsyn was, is sekerlik die afdeling wat
moet toesien dat die armste van die armes, ja, werkloses, bejaardes,
weerlose en verwaarloosde kinders en gestremdes, voedsel op hulle tafels
het. Miljoene wag ook nog vir die uitvoering van die belofte van 'n dak oor
hul kop.

Vandag praat ons oor 'n adviesraad van maatskaplike ontwikkeling, 'n raad
wat die Minister oor verskillende aspekte gaan adviseer, en ook as
bemiddelaar of as kanaal sal dien tussen die publiek en die Minister. Die
land word gekniehalter deur 'n regeringstelsel waar wanadministrasie,
bedrog, korrupsie en onvermoë aan die orde van die dag is. Ou mense en
gestremde persone se toelaes word in baie gevalle gekanselleer,
aansoekdokumente verdwyn sonder goeie rede, of sommige amptenare tree
moedswillig onredelik en onmenslik op teenoor mense, en plaas hulle so
onder onnodige spanning in hul reeds moeilike omstandighede.

Hierdie adviesraad sal moet toesien dat die Minister luister na die stem
van die mense en welsynsorganisasies daar buite. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs P W CUPIDO: Madam Speaker, hon members of this House and voters who
faithfully sit in front of the television every afternoon to listen to how
politicians manage our country's affairs, the Department of Social
Development, which was previously the Department of Welfare, is certainly
the department which has to see to it that the poorest of the poor, yes,
the unemployed, the aged, defenceless and neglected children and the
disabled, have food on their tables. Millions are also still waiting for
the fulfilment of the promise of a roof over their heads.

Today we are talking about an advisory board on social development, a board
which is going to advise the Minister on various aspects, and also serve as
a mediator or a channel between the public and the Minister. The country is
being hampered by a government system in which maladministration, fraud,
corruption and inability are the order of the day. The grants for the aged
and the disabled are cancelled in many cases, application documents
disappear without good reason, or some officials deliberately behave
unreasonably and inhumanely towards people, and in this way place them
under unnecessary pressure in their already difficult circumstances.

This advisory board will have to see to it that the Minister listens to the
voice of the people and welfare organisations out there.]

This board will also have to ensure that transparency and accountability
exist. It must promote stakeholder and, in particular, consumer and grass-
roots participation. It must facilitate dialogue between Government and
civil society on social development issues.

The Democratic Alliance demands that this board investigate the collapse of
delivery services to the poorest of the poor. This must be the first and
most important assignment of this board. They must identify, promote,
monitor and evaluate policy, legislation and programmes with regard to
social development and its impact on the quality of life of the people. I
would like to emphasise that they must ensure delivery at grass-roots
level.

The taxpayers of this country and the voters out there have voted for, and
agreed to, the appointment of civil servants, a department that is supposed
to function well, a Ministry entrusted to the ANC Government, several
committees and forums, and now an advisory board to advise the Minister.
However, my question is: Do all these appointments bring relief to poverty
in this country? If I should sit in a shack today, or if I sleep in the
bush or am retrenched because of the increase in unemployment, do I really
enjoy a better life for all since the ANC took over this Government?

If this Government cannot feed the nation, if it cannot create jobs, if it
cannot create foreign investment, if it cannot change the crime statistics
of this country, if it cannot make public appointments on merit, if it
cannot accept active participation, and if it cannot institute the
Constitution of this country ...

... het dit tyd geword dat die kiesers wakker skrik, en ernstig en
indringend kyk na 'n alternatiewe regering. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die mense van
hierdie land wil immers gesond leef, hulle wil werk, hulle wil 'n dak oor
hul koppe hê, hulle soek gesonde investering en hulle wil veilig beweeg.
Beveiliging van elke individu moet 'n prioriteit van die Regering wees.
Hulle wil misdadigers agter tralies sien. Met ander woorde, die publiek
daar buite moet besef, en agb lede wat vandag hier sit,  kan dit maar glo,
die publiek besef wel dat 'n alternatiewe regering, dit wil sê 'n absolute
nuwe regering, die antwoord vir ons land en sy probleme is, en beslis nie
die ANC soos hy vandag hier sit nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die DA het begrip vir ons land se mense, ons ken die mense se lyding, ons
vertrou saam met die mense dat die nuwe adviesraad sal help om te sorg vir
dienslewering aan die armes, dit te bevorder en te verbeter. Hulle gaan dit
beslis nie by die ANC-regering kry soos hulle nou hier sit nie.
Die DA steun hierdie wetgewing. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[... the time has come for the voters to wake up and take a serious and
penetrating look at an alternative government. [Interjections.] After all,
the people of this country want to live healthily, they want to work, they
want a roof over their heads, they want sound investments and they want to
move around safely. The safeguarding of each individual must be a priority
of the Government. They want to see criminals behind bars. In other words,
the public out there must realise, and hon members sitting here today can
believe it, the public does realise, that an alternative government, that
is to say an absolutely new government, is the solution for our country and
its problems, and certainly not the ANC as it is sitting here today.
[Interjections.]

The DA understands our country's people, we know the people's suffering, we
trust, together with the people, that the new advisory board will help to
ensure service delivery for the poor, to promote it and improve it. They
are certainly not going to get it from the ANC Government as they are
sitting here now.
The DA supports this legislation.]

Mrs I MARS: Madam Speaker and hon members, the hon the Minister gave us an
extensive briefing on the ultimate benefit of this Bill as part of our
efforts to eradicate poverty and social disparities. On behalf of the IFP I
have great pleasure in supporting the Bill before the House today, and I
will just discuss it as such. We had very fruitful discussions to determine
the exact function of what is now called the Advisory Board on Social
Development. The discussion culminated in the Bill, which finally
determined a close relationship between civil society and Parliament - an
ideal that many members of this House always considered of utmost
importance.

The composition of the board allows for at least eight persons who have
knowledge of or experience in developmental social welfare and are actively
involved in the sector, to act in an advisory capacity to the Minister.
This, in effect, means that civil society, through this board, is able to
respond to and advise the Minister on issues identified by or referred to
the board and to promote stakeholders' participation in social development
from the consumer and the stakeholder sectors.
The participation on the board by the department with a maximum of three
members is also satisfactory, as it means that through its regular
interaction with the provinces, problems experienced at provincial and
local levels needing intervention can also be brought to the board
speedily. The important dialogue between the Ministry, the department and
civil society signifies to us as the IFP, or is tangible evidence, that the
process of transforming the social development sector is indeed well on its
way.

One of the most pleasing aspects of the debates and discussions between the
different parties, as portfolio committee members, the director-general and
a member of her department, and finally the state law advisors, was the
determination to meet the deadline without compromising the Bill. In fact,
during the last few weeks in which the Bill was processed, several clauses
were objected to in their original form, reformulated, debated and
unanimously adopted. This says much for the genuine concern of all involved
to achieve what civil society, namely our voters, demand of us as public
representatives.

The Bill requires the Minister to invite nomination to the board by
publishing notices in the media and the Gazette, thus ensuring that
nominations are representative of the broader sectors of the social
development community and civil society as a whole. From this pool of
nominations, the parliamentary committee on social development will make
recommendations to the Minister for appointment as members of the board.
This, in turn, will ensure that skills, knowledge and experience - in the
best interest of those affected - will determine the representation on the
board.

What in its original form was a somewhat vague document has been sharpened
and defined in an exemplary manner into a useful tool to advance the needs
of social society at the monitoring and recipient levels. We hope that this
Bill will make a difference, and we believe it can.

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Madam Speaker, in an attempt to address the past
inadequacies of welfare governance, section 26 of Chapter 3 of the White
Paper on Social Welfare stresses the need for appropriate, legitimate,
transparent and, above all, effective governance mechanisms. In the
interest of the people of South Africa, we fully endorse this statement. As
a party and as the new growing movement of all the people, the New NP and
the DA are committed to any genuine process that will contribute towards
the improvement of the quality of life of all the people of South Africa.

The importance of and the need for opportunities to convey the message from
the people to the Government is stressed by the fact that more than 70
submissions from organisations and provincial governments were received by
the Portfolio Committee on Social Development. However, it is significant
to note that the only provincial department that did not make an input was
the Eastern Cape. Why? This, of course, is further proof of its ignorance
and incompetence in the field of social development and the area of service
delivery. We want to thank them for their honesty in showing their lack of
interest and knowledge of the needs of the people.

The primary function of the board will be to act as an advisory body to the
Minister and Government through the inputs by civil society. We trust that
the Minister will acknowledge the broad participation and commitment of all
the people of South Africa in his appointment of the members of the board.
South Africa possesses a wealth of knowledge with a lot of experience which
is not limited to ANC NGOs and cronies only.
The envisaged board must be able to advise the Minister on measures to
promote the transformation and continuous improvement on policy and social
development services. This should include important matters such as poverty
relief programmes and the role of local government in the delivery of
welfare services to all the sectors of civil society. It will also advise
on service delivery at provincial level.

The board will investigate international best practices in social
development and report to the Minister, in an attempt to empower him and
the department to keep in touch with global social development issues and
solutions. In order for the board to fulfil its real purpose, it will
continuously have to interact with, take cognisance of the needs of, and
accept advice from all organisations and individuals outside Government.
This must include trade unions, consumer organisations, the formal and the
informal social development sector, NGOs, CBOs, religious organisations and
many other organisations involved in the delivery of social development
services.

The New NP and the DA are in touch with the needs and the suffering of the
people on a daily basis. [Interjections.] We are being approached by more
and more people and organisations who are adversely affected by the
inability of the Government to deal with the challenges in the social
development sector. For those people in South Africa who are suffering as a
result of bad governance and bad decision-making, the establishment of the
Advisory Board on Social Development will provide a body through which
those who have practical knowledge in the social development field will be
able to transfer their expertise to the Government.

We trust that this board will help to enable the Government to understand
the needs of the abused child, the old-age pensioner, the mentally disabled
and the blind, and all those other organisations that are involved in the
social development sector who need to be heard in their cry for
understanding and support. In the interests of the people of Zwide,
Kwazakele New Brighton, Helenvale and Algoa Park ... [Interjections.] Yes,
I represent those people in Zwide and Kwazakele - the New NP and the
Democratic Alliance will support this Bill. [Applause.]

Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker, hon Minister of Social Development, hon
Deputy Minister, other hon Ministers and hon colleagues, the Bill before us
is a finished product of transformation in the true semantic sense of the
word. We in the Portfolio Committee on Social Development had to transform
the Bill so that it conforms to the new name of the department, namely the
Department of Social Development. We also had to panel beat it by removing
certain clauses, recasting others and re-ordering the sections to the
satisfaction of all the parties involved.

The Bill before hon members is no longer the Developmental Welfare
Governance Bill, but the Advisory Board on Social Development Bill. The
definition of the phrase ``social development'', namely the process of
planned institutional or structural change to maintain a balance between
human needs and social policies and programmes including empowering
individuals and communities to become self-reliant, touches the hearts of
the target groups.

A partnership between Government and civil society is adequately addressed
under the composition of the board in clause 5(1)(b), which reads:


  At least eight are persons who have knowledge or experience of social
  development and are actively involved in the social development sector.
Oku kuya kwenza okokuba wonke umntu osemaphandleni akwazi ukuthumela oyena
mntu acinga ukuba unokummela kulo mbutho uza kucebisa uMphathiswa
wezeNtlalo-ntle. [This will enable everybody who lives in the rural areas
to send a person that they think will represent their interests in the
advisory board of the Minister of Social Development.]

We in the committee have deliberately avoided the word ``representative'',
as there are so many groupings within civil society. It should be
emphasised that the intention of the Bill is to provide the Minister with
an appropriate source for purposes of advice and consultation.

  The duties of the board are of great significance. Clause 4(3) states:
  Any advice or recommendation to the Minister must include the minority
  views of one or more members of the board.

Sijonge kuMphathiswa wezeNtlalo-ntle okokuba eli qumrhu liza kucebisana
naye liza kusebenzisana kakuhle naye. Aze angakhethi ezidolophini kuphela,
acinge nge intsukaphi yakhe. [Kwaqhwatywa.] [We hope that the hon the
Minister and this committee will co-operate. He should not think only about
the urban areas, but he should remember where he comes from. [Applause.]]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, the establishment of the Advisory Board
on Social Development is, in some respects, a good indication of the
recognition given to the great heritage of civil activity in this country.
We hope that the creation of this board will help enhance the national
legacy built up over the years by our civil organisations.

The ACDP has no immediate objection to the idea of establishing this
advisory board. We do encourage all organisations, wherever possible, to
forge partnerships with the state if this will assist to harness better
delivery of social services.

The ACDP has always held the view that there are certain distinguishable
parameters that separate the operations of the state from those of civil
society. These are, however, not necessarily mutually exclusive. The
analogy of one body, many parts, fits this explanation very well. We
believe the objectives and duties of the advisory board ought to be
understood in a similar fashion.

The ACDP is of the opinion that should the board seek to base its
operational principles on promoting the general wellbeing of the South
African family, the relationship between civil society and the state will
be much closer and both will be better able to alleviate some of the social
problems of our society. The object of the Bill is to advise the Minister
and to act as a consultative forum for the Minister as regards
developmental social welfare issues and to promote stakeholder
participation, particularly from the grass-roots sector.

We must guard against the tendency of Government officials to overload the
board. This will defeat the purpose of having broad representation of civil
society, for which this Bill is intended. Increasing the board from nine to
eleven members should not undermine its work, but should enhance it.

If there is to be improvement in the quality of provincial and national
social development, then the need to have provincial structures in place is
critical, in order to review the formulation, implementation and evaluation
of programmes in provinces. This gives greater accountability and
efficiency.
Local government has a definite role to play by providing integrated
delivery of services, and this includes measures aimed at poverty
alleviation, the administration of grants-in-aid and housing for the poor
and impoverished. Owing to the transformation of local government itself,
there are, however, concerns as to whether local government has the
capacity to deliver at all.

Fiscal prudence and effective management are required to ensure that the
board can perform its duties in an efficient manner. The department must
keep a watchful eye on how the moneys are spent.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, for the nation to succeed, it is necessary
that bridges and linkages are put in place between Government and civil
society. The envisaged Advisory Board on Social Development will serve as
one such bridge between Government and civil society.

The board, among others, will advise the Minister on measures to promote
poverty relief, poverty reduction and poverty elimination. The board will
declare unconditional war on poverty in this country. It is this board that
will propose new funding criteria for developmental welfare. We hope that
the board will not comprise of bureaucrats who will depend on what they
have read in making their decisions. Members of the board should be
passionate about their tasks and go out into the country and see how people
eke out a living.

There are poor people in this country to whom everything that has been said
about change or transformation, whatever one calls it, is something unheard
of. To many, conditions are worse than before 1994. The proliferation of
boards and councils set up to streamline development leaves them destitute.
All they need is food in order to live. The envisaged Advisory Board on
Social Development will serve as a watchdog for those who are destitute and
will speak on their behalf.

It is unfortunate that the composition of the board appears to be limited
to department officials, institutions dealing with social development and
one representative from organisations representing persons who use social
development services. The extent to which the board will be representative
has to take into account the rural-urban dichotomy. The hon the Minister
said that consideration would be given to institutions such as churches to
assist in the distribution of social development materials.

We believe that other structures, such as travel authorities at the local
government level, can be helpful in outlying rural areas. Their
effectiveness will, of course, depend on their being trained and prepared
for the purpose. The UCDP supports the Bill.

[Mrs T J TSHIVHASE: Madam Speaker, hon members of Parliament, this is the
first time that we have a Bill that gives citizens an opportunity to
comment about their own development. The Bill establishes an advisory board
which people report to about matters concerning development in their own
areas. Our Government is reaching out to its citizens so that they use
those procedures to participate. They must not listen to the empty dreams
of the opposition parties such as the DA.

Before 1994 attention was only paid to urban people as far as development
was concerned. Those people in rural areas, especially blacks, were not
considered when providing services, financial assistance and pension
payouts. Therefore, the new Government is making an effort to provide those
services to rural people. There is also equal distribution of fertile and,
assistance to farmers, health-care facilities, housing, water, schools and
so on.

There is a need for new buildings in which to render services because the
old ones are dilapidated. This task is slow because of various problems. So
far, development in rural areas has somehow stopped because most NGOs are
concentrating on the urban areas. There are few if any NGOs in the rural
areas.

This Bill makes it possible for citizens to advise the Minister and his
department about issues concerning them. Citizens have to forward their
grievances, including the services they require. The function of the board
will be to inform the Minister of the services required and how they should
be rendered. The success of the board will depend on the participation of
all citizens.

The year 2001 is one in which everyone is encouraged to participate and be
responsible for doing things for the benefit of all. We call upon all
people, especially in the rural areas, to stand up and get involved in
their own development. They must form organisations which will see to it
that lack of services in their areas is addressed. The NGOs will get
involved in various projects and programmes to eliminate poverty.

In this task, citizens should nominate representatives who will work in the
advisory board. This is an opportunity to advise the Government on which
developments to tackle and prioritise. As far as the rendering of services
is concerned, community organisations will also influence the advisory
board. The facilitation of this process will be made possible by the
participation of representatives of the different community organisations.

This Bill also encourages people to participate in planning their own
future. Therefore, people and all stakeholders are required to participate
for the sake of progress. I am making an urgent appeal for all people,
including the previously disadvantaged, to be active in the development of
their areas. Their coming together in various programmes will be
beneficial.

Developing the standard of living depends on the unity of people and the
Government. The Government alone cannot deal with all the requirements of
its citizens. Neighbourhood groups, social workers, service providers and
all workers must unite and strengthen themselves in working for the
improvement of their areas.

This Bill also allows time for self-reliance. This will bring about change
in the lives of all people. We as the ANC care about a better life for all
our citizens. The participation of all people will make our democracy work.
The other day, people were seen on television collecting funds for the care
of poor children and those infected with HIV/Aids. The money collected was
used to build a centre for those children. That was something that brought
happiness to those children because they have a place they can call home.

In conclusion, the ANC supports this Bill and urges all South Africans to
participate in this great task. [Applause.]]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President, hon Ministers and
members, the power of development is the heart of transformation. The
Advisory Board on Social Development Bill is designed to facilitate the
integrated economic and social action plans at the local, provincial and
national levels of government.

The Bill makes provision for the overall transformation of the welfare
system from a purely residual to a developmental one. The sensitive
representation of race, gender and disability in the composition of the
board is intended to mobilise a collective partnership between society,
stakeholders and the Government so that the decision-making process is
executed with significant understanding of the needs and desires of the
people.
Section 8(1) of the Bill indicates that the chairperson will be appointed
by the Minister before the first meeting of a newly constituted board.
However, from the MF point of view, in order to strengthen the visibility
of transparency and accountability, it is advised that the chairperson be
elected at the first meeting of the board. In rehabilitating the
differences that currently exist, the board's welfare structure will depend
on its productiveness in guiding the principles of equity, sustainability,
access and co-operative governance. The MF supports the Advisory Board on
Social Development Bill. [Applause.]

Ms C M P RAMOTSAMAI: Madam Speaker, I am quite disappointed by the hon
member Cupido. I do not know why she normally uses this podium to
politicise everything. This Bill is not about politics at all. I do not
know whether she received instructions during caucus from her leaders to
politicise this. She does not realise that we are here to rectify the mess
that was made by her party and to transform this country. If she is not
ready for transformation, she must just leave this country. We are here to
transform and we are not moving back.

She participated in this Bill and we gave her her due for doing quite well.
But I think she must have taken instructions from somewhere and that is not
acceptable. We are going to deal with her behaviour. This Bill goes a long
way towards addressing the inadequacies of the past that are acknowledged
by the White Paper on Social Welfare of 1996. These inadequacies include,
amongst others, a lack of legitimacy for social development services,
exclusivity of services, perpetuated disparities and selective delivery of
services.

The Minister and the chairperson of the portfolio committee ...
[Interjections.] Could that hon member shut up, please!

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, will you take your seat, please. There is a
point of order.

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Madam Speaker, is it in order for the hon member to
threaten me in Parliament and in public? [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! It is out of order to threaten someone. But I am not
sure what was meant by ``I will deal with you later''. [Laughter.] Could
you proceed, please.
Ms C P M RAMOTSAMAI: Madam Speaker, the hon Minister and the chairperson of
the portfolio committee ... [Interjections.]

Mr R S SCHOEMAN: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: In the light of the
matter raised by the hon member, would you, perhaps, not consider asking
that hon member what exactly she meant by that statement.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I will rule. I am assuming that nobody is
threatening anyone. If the hon member did make a threat, could she please
withdraw that threat.

Ms C P M RAMOTSAMAI: Madam Speaker, what I meant was that I would deal with
the hon member politically in the portfolio committee. [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Thank you very much.

Ms C P M RAMOTSAMAI: Madam Speaker, I am going to focus my attention on the
amendments the committee made to the Bill, and the leadership role played
by the ANC in the portfolio committee.

Firstly, the title was changed from Developmental Welfare Governance Bill
to Advisory Board on Social Development Bill. This indicates the shift in
emphasis both in the objectives of the Bill and in the work of the
department. The Bill does not only concern itself with the issues of social
development governance, but also really seeks to establish an advisory and
consultative body that will enable the hon Minister to be in  direct
dialogue with the social development sector.

The committee requested the department to insert in clause 1 of the Bill
the definition ``social development'', moving away from welfare which, in
many instances, is interpreted as handouts. The most important principle
followed in setting out the objectives of the Bill is that the board must
be in a position to advise the hon Minister on decisions that will directly
affect social development initiatives and that the board must provide the
linking forum where discussions between Government and civil society can
take place. Crucial to this is that no national welfare will bring
mandates, as members of the board will not only represent the formal social
development organisations, but will also be drawn in because of their work
pertaining to the development needs of rural and neglected communities.

The committee spent considerable time refining the objectives and duties of
the board. The original clause 4, which dealt with the powers of the board,
was scrapped and some of its elements were incorporated under the
objectives of the board. In this regard, the comments received from a wide
range of civil society stakeholders were incorporated, especially concerns
that the original Bill did not make provision for a broad representation of
civil society.

As the Bill stands, the Minister has the discretion to decide how many
Government representatives he wants on the board, while the Bill clearly
puts forward eight persons as the minimum number of civil society
representatives. Concerns were raised about the fact that members of the
board would be remunerated, and the ANC position was that board members
should, where possible, receive compensation if their attendance of a
meeting meant a loss of income to them. At the same time, the principle
accepted was that membership of the board would be an honour for the
organisation that nominated their member and that membership would not
become a paid occupation. The ANC provided leadership in this regard.

To avoid members of the board serving on the board for the next 20 years
...

Mrs P W CUPIDO: You are lying!

Ms C P M RAMOTSAMAI: Madam Speaker, is the hon member allowed to say that I
am lying?

The SPEAKER: Order! Could you please withdraw that statement, hon Mrs
Cupido.

Ms C P M RAMOTSAMAI: I want that hon member to stand up and apologise.
[Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Order! I did hear a reference to lying. Could you please
withdraw that statement. I heard you making it. If I misheard you, please
clarify.

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Madam Speaker, I withdraw the statement. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Thank you very much. Please proceed, hon member.

Ms C P M RAMOTSAMAI: Madam Speaker, to avoid members of the board serving
on it for the next 20 years, as has been the case before, the Bill now
provides that members are eligible for reappointment to the board for no
more than one consecutive term.

The parliamentary committee will play an important role in the process of
appointing members of the board, by making recommendations to the Minister
in this regard. The Bill specifies that in appointing members, special
attention must be given regarding depth of knowledge and insight into
social development, as well as the representativeness of the board. Of
course, the Minister will have the final say.

In this way, the committee will ensure that the Minister has at his
disposal the talents of as wide as possible a spectrum of representatives
from civil society. The committee also intends using this role to open up
for itself the possibility of critically watching over the kinds of bodies
established through legislation. In this regard, we have proposed that the
board table annual reports to Parliament. We believe that such reports
would enhance the commitment of members appointed to the board in
fulfilling the objectives set out in the Bill.

Lastly, I want to thank our chairperson for playing a leadership and a
guiding role during this process. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker, I want to take this
opportunity to thank all the hon members who spoke here for the support
that they have given the department and me during this whole process. We
hope we will continue to work in this manner, cooperating with each other
and ensuring that we achieve what we came here for, and that is the
betterment of the lives of our people, and the poorest of the poor, and
generally working very closely with the nongovernmental sector and, more
importantly, with the churches and all other religious groups. I stand here
to recognise them for the work that they have been doing with the
department and the whole sector in ensuring that the voice of the poor and
the poorest of the poor is heard, and that Government and the private
sector work together.

More importantly, I would also like to thank the private sector for the
assistance that they are giving the department. The challenges that we
basically face as a Department and as Government are not only to recognise
the role that is always played by the private sector in the welfare sector
and the social development sector, but also to work with them in a more
unified and more systematic way to ensure that whatever we do has an impact
on the lives of our people. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

  PAN-AFRICANISM IS THE COMPASS FOR RESTORING AFRICA'S DIGNITY, PROSPERITY
                                  AND POWER

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, Africa is the epicentre of this planet. She
has impeccable credentials to occupy a prominent place in the world.
Africans own a continent three times the size of China and the United
States of America combined, and twenty times the size of the European
Economic Community.

Historically, Africa has had a privileged role in world affairs. Africa is
holy land. It is where man was born. She is the cradle of man's
civilisation. Africa provided leadership in various spheres of endeavour to
this world for 600 000 years. Africa has immense wealth. Almost every
mineral is found in Africa, including oil. Almost every agricultural
product can be grown in Africa.

That great Pan-Africanist, Kwame Nkrumah, hit the nail on the head when he
said, and I quote:


  If Africa's multiple resources were used in her own development, they
  could place Africa among the most modernised continents of the world. But
  Africa's resources are used for the development of overseas interests.

Pan-Africanists hold that only Pan-Africanism can rescue Africa from this
quagmire. Pan-Africanism has over a period of 100 years shown its
resilience and demonstrated its tenacity against the machinations of
emperialist forces by destroying classical colonialism in Africa. Current
Pan-African efforts, such as the establishment of the Pan-African
Parliament, are further evidence of Pan-Africanists' persistence in the
protracted struggle for the ultimate realisation of a united states of
Africa, which the PAC leader Zephania Mothopeng called ``the Giant
Monolithic state of Africa''.

Pan-Africanism is the compass for restoring Africa's dignity, power and
prosperity. Pan-Africanism is not an imported political philosophy. Pan-
Africanism was conceived in the womb of Africa. Pan-Africanism is not a
European imitation. As a political philosophy, Pan-Africanism was developed
and nourished by great African political scientists, scholars, historians,
philosophers and revolutionaries such as Sylvester Williams, Garvey,
Duboise, George Padmore, Azikiwe, Nkrumah, Anta Diop, Sobukwe and Lembede.

Pan-Africanism demands that the riches of Africa be used for the benefit
and development of the African people. Pan-Africanism seeks to achieve
genuine African independence, economic emancipation, eradication of poverty
and technological advancement. It is a set of principles containing social,
cultural, economic, spiritual, moral and material aspects of life. It is a
system of equitable sharing of food, clothing, homes, education, skills,
top health care, work, land, employment, wealth, security of life and
happiness for the people of Africa and of African descent.

Pan-Africanism can empower Africans to stop destroying themselves in
internal strife, such as has been the case in Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia,
Rwanda, Sierra Leone, DRC, Burundi and Angola. A leading Pan-Africanist
leader put it succinctly 40 years ago when he said:


  If we do not formulate plans for unity and take active steps to form a
  political union, we will soon be fighting and warring among ourselves,
  with imperialists and colonialists standing behind the scenes and pulling
  vicious wires to make us cut each others throat for the sake of their
  diabolic purposes for Africa.

The Pan-African struggle is to stop the state of economic servitude and
exploitation in which Africans live, with consequences of poverty,
diseases, ignorance, and a shorter life expectancy and the highest child
mortality. Pan-Africanism is a political philosophy which accentuates the
uniformity of an African destiny and can enable its people to preserve a
collective action in facing challenges of imperialist domination.

The brutal rape of Africa by imperialists demands Pan-Africanism.
[Interjections.] This is the historical necessity of building the destroyed
walls of Africa and consolidating her as a united, prosperous continent.
The strength of Pan-Africanism lies in its inherent reality and
revolutionary insight and foresight. All that Africans need to do is to
meet the high but achievable standards of Pan-Africanism. Even the most
hostile forces against Pan-Africanism in Africa today can no longer slander
Pan-Africanism. In the face of profound distress, Africa continues to
suffer.

What is happening in Africa today with regard to the Pan-African Parliament
did not fall from the sky. Pan-Africanists have been working hard for the
realisation of these goals at a time when others were ideologically
hijacked and were even ashamed of calling themselves Africans, equating
Africanisms and Pan-Africanism with racism.
In this country the founding president of the PAC, Mangaliso Robert
Sobukwe, wrote about the African union and how to bring it about as early
as January 1960. That was at a time when Pan-Africanism was a swearword to
some who are today compelled by the realities of Africa to join the African
Union. [Interjections.]

Pan-Africanists admit that the Pan-African task is colossal, but that it is
not impossible. Yes, the sworn enemies of Pan-Africanism who overthrew
Nkrumah, assassinated Murtala Muhammad, Patrice Lumumba, Thomas Sankara,
Maurice Bishop and poisoned Sobukwe on Robben Island for their commitment
to the cause of Pan-Africanism will continue to assassinate all those who
are committed to Pan-Africanism and the restoration to Africa of her lost
power. However, the PAC calls on Africa never to deviate from the tested
Pan-African path, which has been a beacon of light in the stormy sea, for
the survival and security of Africa.

The truth of the matter is that it is impossible to reconstruct and develop
a divided Africa without a common position towards external forces. The
problems of Africa, such as foreign debt, trade, devaluation of African
currencies, low prices for African exports, blackmail with aid by forces
wanting to bully Africa, IMF structural adjustments, foreign wars by proxy
in Africa, reparations, etc are Africa's problems which demand a Pan-
African solution.

Pan-Africanism is an imperative response to globalisation. Difficulties on
the Pan-African road will discourage cowards only. Men and women who stand
boldly in the defence of Africa in the sea of political falsehood and
confusion are not made of tender fibre. They are not women and men with
lily fingers. They are sons and daughters of Africa whom historical
necessity has called upon to contend with the stern realities of life with
its vicissitudes. A smooth sea never made a skilful mariner.

Moreover, the tragedy of life does not lie in not reaching our goals, but
in having no goals to reach. It is not a calamity to die with ideals
unfulfilled, but it is a calamity to have no ideals to fulfil. It is not a
disgrace not to reach the stars, but it is a disgrace to have no stars to
reach. Pan-Africanists have stars to reach.

Let me remind hon members of the words of that Pan-Africanist visionary,
Mangaliso Robert Sobukwe, in his 1959 state-of-the- nation address. He
said:


  Sons and daughters of Africa, we are standing on the threshold of an
  historic era. We are blazing a new trail, and we invite you to be with us
  creators of history ... March with us to freedom and independence.
  Tomorrow the United States of Africa.

UMvelinqangi abusise i-Afrika, amadodana namadodakazi ayo. [God bless
Africa, its sons and its daughters.] Tiko ra hina! Shango lashu! Lefatshe
la rona! Ilizwe lethu! [The land is ours!] [Applause.]

Prof B TUROK: Madam Speaker, my contribution to this debate is to set out
the context in which Pan-Africanism continues to be influential.

A week ago London's The Economist published a remarkable editorial. It was
so remarkable that I wish to read two paragraphs for the record, for the
enlightenment of the House and others. It says:


  ... for many years the rich world has made it hard for Africa to earn an
  honest living through trade ... if North America, Europe and Japan were
  to eliminate all barriers to imports from sub-Saharan Africa, the
  region's exports would rise by 14%, an annual increase worth about $2,5
  billion. Another calculation shows that developed countries' farm
  subsidies amount to over $360 billion a year, some $30 billion more than
  Africa's entire GDP. And while the prices of rich countries' exports have
  been rising, Africa's primary products have ... been falling (by 25% in
  1997-99).

That means that the terms of trade have been moving against Africa in the
last two years that these countries have been talking about poverty
reduction. It's a story that the continent has been familiar with for
decades.

The editorial goes on to say:


  During the Cold War, it was happy to fight its wars through African
  proxies, to prop up corrupt regimes and sell them weapons with which to
  suppress their subjects and swell their foreign debt ... that debt has
  been crushing for Africa: several countries have been spending more on
  service payments than on education and health ... aid ... has often been
  tied to western exports ... official aid has been dwindling - from $32
  per African in 1990 to $19 in 1998.

This is a remarkable editorial in a very conservative newspaper and not
some radical outfit in the UK.

I want to make one or two personal remarks about my own conversion to Pan-
Africanism. As a young boy in Cape Town, I was told that I was a European,
and that, far to the North, there was some continent called Africa with
which we in South Africa had nothing to do. I was told that we belonged to
Europe.

My understanding was changed completely when I was in exile, in East
Africa. In 1966, I was travelling by car with my family from Kenya to
Tanzania. When we arrived at the border post, the Tanzanian official said I
must fill in a form. On the form there were three boxes. One box had
``European'' written on it, the second ``African'' and the third ``Other.''
The immigration officer said I must tick the European box, and I refused. I
told him that I was not a European, but a South African refugee, and that I
had never been to Europe and was not going to tick the European box. He
asked me what I was going to do. I told him that I was going to tick the
African box because I am an African. We negotiated, I was surrounded by my
children who were cheering - they loved the altercation. Finally, we
reached a compromise and settled for ``white African.''

So, in the following years, when we lived in Tanzania and elsewhere in
Africa, my children, at school, were sometimes called ``Kaburu'' meaning
``Boers'' because we were from South Africa. I always said: ``No, no! We
are ``white Africans.'' So, my conversion to Pan-Africanism was
instantaneous at that moment, and I realised psychologically that I
belonged to Africa, and it has been like that ever since.

I was fortunate to live under Kenyatta, Nyerere and Kaunda. So, I can
faithfully say that I have an intense familiarity with the continent and a
great love for it. It has been pointed out many times that Pan-Africanism
started under Nkrumah. He had the view that: ``You seek first the political
kingdom and then the economics will follow you.'' It is extraordinary that,
at that time, so long ago, he advocated an African political union, and it
is today and now that we are talking about an African parliament, which
shows that vision is not lost and history remembers.

However, as Africa began to consolidate its independence, the realisation
came that African economies were monocrop-economies, and that all the
countries were dependent on primary commodity export. The worst of all is
that these primary exports commodity industries were under foreign control.
So, in the succeeding years, Nkrumah, later followed by other leaders such
as Nyerere and Kaunda, began to try and seize control of their own
economies and of their own wealth.

I want to give two or three statistics concerning Africa's wealth. It has
97% of the world's chrome, 85% of the world's platinum, 64% of the world's
manganese, 70% of the world's cocoa and so on. Africa is rich in resources
and yet poor in the quality of life for its people. This is why, under the
vigilant eyes of people such as the economists and others, Nyerere and
Kaunda began a process which was also happening in Latin America, of import
substitution industrialisation. In other words, it was a kind of
nationalisation to seize control of their own resources. It was an attempt
to make real the independence that they had achieved, and to try and
transcend the colonialism and the neocolonialism that they were subjected
to. Fortunately, the Economic Commission of Africa came up with a plan, the
Lagos Plan of Action, which was intended to transcend the inherited
Balkanisation of Africa.

I come to the present time where the ANC is reviving the notion of a Pan-
Africanism which is real, concrete and not based on some mysticism, but
based on the economic unification of Africa, firstm, within nations,
second, at regional level and third, at continental level. We are
celebrating the existence of Ecowas, PTA, SADC and other regional
institutions which are going to establish and reinforce Africa's wealth.

I say with some pride that my early notions that I was a European have been
transcended by the notion that I belong to Africa, and that this House
belongs to Africa. So we can celebrate Pan-Africanism in the context of a
new situation and a new environment where the African Renaissance begins to
take on a real existence and where the Millennium African Recovery
Programme is a blueprint, and which, by the way, is worth looking at. It
revives some of the very concepts that Nkrumah raised and which were raised
at the Lagos Plan of Action and by the Economic Commission for Africa. I
have no time to deal with those, but, once again, those ideas live on and
we must celebrate that fact. [Applause.]

Mr N S BRUCE: Madam Speaker, the magnificence of Rabbi Turok's pyjama top
and his instant conversion on the road to Lagos compels me to tell members
a Christian story. In sharp contrast to some parts, the Christian Gospel
was received, in the 3rd century, with eagerness on the burning sands of
Africa. It was animated by the zeal of its converts, adorned by the
eloquence of its bishops and enriched by the spirituality of its
philosophers.

St Augustine was then, and is now, the most important of the African
philosopher bishops. In his confessions, he recorded his exhortation to God
to give him chastity and continence,``but, Lord'', he pleaded, ``not just
yet''. I am sorry that President Mbeki is not here, for according to a
magazine called Nosegay, always fearless in its inaccuracy, ...
[Interjections] ... the President would have appreciated this irony, if not
the bishop's episcopal profundity.

What St Augustine was pleading for was for the elevation of his soul
through mortification by God, before God granted him the grace we all need
to eschew temptation. But, it seems to me, that this is a plea that still
rings in some 21st century Pan-African ears: ``Give us dignity, prosperity
and power, but, Lord, not just yet.''

Dignity, prosperity and power are universally acknowledged virtues, the
only question being how to set the process of achievement going to speed it
along and ensure its success. It is neither a novel endeavour nor one that
can boast past success. Pan-Africanism was enshrined by Kwame Nkrumah in
Ghana in the '50s, and was expressed in the capturing of the political
kingdom and the politicisation of the economy through collectivisation.

The colonial powers had already allowed the partial politicisation of some
economies, moving away from the efficiencies of the free market and
introducing race-based social engineering. This process was started by
Rhodes, extended by Smuts, legitimised by Verwoerd, entrenched by Vorster
and exploited by Smith. In the end, it just bowled Botha over.

Aspirant black leaders were quick to consolidate political control and
their own racism as tribal conflicts emerged. They introduced the concept
of heroic or charismatic leadership implied in Leninism. This process
unleashed the greatest scourge of the 20th century - the professional
politician, fired by social engineering, inspired by collectivism and
deluded by the messianic leadership.

Nkrumah became the redeemer. Joseph Mobutu became Monutu Sese Seko Kuku
Nghendu Wa Za Banga (the cock that leaves no hens alone). Bokassa became an
emperor, Idi Amin became a general. With all the submarines we are buying,
President Mbeki will, no doubt, become an admiral with a Cabinet Minister
in every port.

By the '60s, absolute power - members should remember Lord Acton - had
begun to corrupt absolutely, and had perverted liberation into vote-
manipulating dictatorships. In 1961, Nkrumah said: All Africans know that I
represent Africa, and that I speak in her name. Therefore, no African can
have an opinion that differs from mine.'' [Interjections.]
The one-party state followed and the protection of the rule of law gave way
to a democratically dubious right to vote. In the process, many economies
failed and social engineering gave way to totalitarianism. Pan-Africanism
proved a costly and ghastly failure. [Interjections.]

Noble though the piety of St Augustine was, it did not and could not create
the conditions that introduced the Renaissance and later the Industrial
Revolution which improved the brutish lot of mankind throughout the world
beyond recognition. The Protestant revolution and secularisation of the
West introduced the modern capitalist system which even Marx acknowledged
was capable, through the enhancement of entrepreneurial pursuit, of rapid
wealth creation. The Industrial Revolution brought suppliers and customers
into increasingly convenient contact. The process was continued with each
new revolution such as technological, biological and information and so it
goes on.

Thus, today we have choices. One is to seek prosperity and success through
engagement in the global market by adhering to our traditional trading
partners. But, in that event, we have to engage in the unfortunate politics
of the trade bloc. We will have to seek out allies, however, wherever we
can find the synergies and successes needed to trade and engage with the
world's most prosperous markets. We need their support to assault, for
instance, fortress Europe in two important areas: their agricultural and
textile policies that remain protected and the notion that foreign aid
helps the poor when it preserves inequality and entrenches poverty.

To those countries that are struggling to pay for excessive social
security, aid is a cheap way of avoiding the removal of politically
sensitive protectionist policies. The thrust of our diplomacy should be to
persuade our traditional trading partners that the greatest benefit they
can bestow on the developing nations is the acceptance of them as
competitive partners in the global market, or we can forsake globalisation
and choose to join the indigent, whose only cry is debt relief and whose
recognisable initiative is a begging bowl. They may deserve our sympathy
and possibly our charity, but their cause is better served by our example
than the delusion that they are our natural allies.

Our leadership of SADC is a case in point. We are leading reluctant
democrats who too often deny their citizens the freedom to spend the money
as they see fit. We have made all the trade concessions for little in
return. We are leading reluctant horses to drink and not even the hon
``Sarafina'' Zuma can give them water. If we were to choose Pan-Africanism,
we would prolong our mortification indefinitely and be rather like the old
lady who said that if God had intended us to get to the moon, he would not
have given us the SA Railways. [Applause.]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Madam Speaker, the definition of concepts can be a very
vexatious exercise indeed. We have, on occasion, witnessed people coming to
blows over the definition of terms.

Whereas there is no dispute over the geographic location of Africa as a
continent, there are, however, divergent views on who the African is. Some
have defined an African on the basis of colour only, where, if one is
black, one is an African. We cannot accept this. It is too exclusive.
Moreover, it goes against the African idiom. The African idiom does not
define a person on his or her accidental characteristic of colour. I know
that in the recent past people's noses were measured very meticulously in
order to define them. This is unacceptable in our African idiom. Others
have defined an African on the basis of both colour and geographic
location, where by virtue of being born in Africa, one calls oneself
African. This confirms my earlier assertion that the definition of terms
can be very problematic indeed.

The concept of Africanism, like all isms, does embody a system of ideas, or
a philosophy of life if one likes. I know that some people may argue - and
they have, indeed, argued - that the talk about an African philosophy is
the talk about anachronism and is something that has outlived its
suitability. Yes, I agree that various habits of thought and practices can
become archaic and therefore must be discarded and modified. But what
cannot be discarded is the whole society. One cannot just jettison the
whole society on the basis that it has become archaic and old-fashioned. It
is for this reason that politicians have sometimes been referred to as
modernisers.

I am arguing, therefore, that Africanism must be seen as a philosophy of
life and a system of ideas which is particular and peculiar to Africa. My
second argument is that these African ideas have, over the years, formed a
guide to the living of life itself and to argue otherwise is to deny that
our forefathers ever lived a life at all because to live, as they say, is
to name.
In a multicultural society like ours, meaningful racial interaction must
take place on the basis of one's inner strengths, otherwise the price for
this racial interaction is assimilation into some dominant foreign culture.
One need only refer, in this case, to the assimilados of the former French
colonies and the exempted of South Africa. Members will remember that we
used to talk of ``amazemtidi'', which means those who were exempted. There
were times when, for Africans, it was not a right and they had to be
exempted just to buy utshwala besilungu, ugologo nje [liquor]. [Laughter.]
Some people, on the basis of their colour, were not allowed even to drink
that water. It is accidental that I am looking at those members.

These Africans were denied the right to define themselves in their own
terms, which are African terms. They carried labels on them like ``Made in
England'' or ``Made in France''. Ours has been a story of shame and
promise. We were made to feel ashamed of our forms of governance and we
were promised true citizenship once we had undergone total assimilation.
This was not to be.

Therefore, our first challenge is to regain the right to define ourselves
in our own terms, thereby regaining that inner strength which is a
necessary condition in the process of restoring our dignity. Let me just
quote a strange person here. Joseph Stalin realised long ago how important
both physical and moral strength were if one wanted to be taken seriously.
We are told that after the war, three leaders met at the meeting in Yalta.
They were Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill. Roosevelt expressed the desire
of the Pope to have peace in the world. Stalin turned around and asked the
question ``But how many troops does the Pope have?'' [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, it is a shame that this has been the same theme
for all the Pan-Africanist conferences since 1900. It has continued to be
the theme of countless meetings and conferences organised by the
Organisation for African Unity and other bodies. Yet, Africa and Africans
are very far from this goal in spite of thousands of pledges and
declarations, and the adoption of countless charters. Not only is Africa
very far from unity on any other front, it is today the most marginalised,
most oppressed, most exploited, most poverty-stricken, most debt-ridden,
most unstable and most denigrated continent in the world. [Interjections.]

Africa has more than half the world's refugees and it is the least
industrialised of all the developing regions. Thus, we are not just
disunited, but we also have nothing to show for our abundant resources.
Oppression, criminal human rights abuses, lack of opportunity,
discrimination on the basis of ethnic, racial, regional and religious
considerations, ruthless exploitation of the already impoverished, wars,
instability, corruption, maniacal leadership, illiteracy, roads full of
potholes, hunger and disease, and disillusionment characterise the African
sicio-political landscape.

We have too many pressing issues to address and we need to move forward.
For our purpose today, suffice it to note that since the first Pan-African
congress organised by a Trinidadian lawyer, Sylvester Williams, in 1900,
six other Pan-African congresses have been held. The seventh congress was
held in Kampala, Uganda, in April 1994. The themes of all these congresses
were the same: African Unity, African Liberation from Western Imperialism,
African Development, Peace and Progress.

What needs to be done? It is well known that Africa is one of the richest
regions of the world. Before the Gulf War more oil had been exported to the
USA than from Kuwait and Iraq. The southern African region contains all
known space-age minerals. Africa, which is the most central of all
continents, contains a fifth of the world's land mass, with 54 nations and
a population of 600 million.

Why have African leaders been unable to capitalise on their advantages to
change the African reality as presently constituted? In fact the insult to
Africa and Africans can be seen, not only in some of the wishy washy books
and expert opinions that non-Africans produce about us, but also in the
fact that African political leaders have declared war on researchers,
academics and young people with merit. The African brain drain must be
turned around. Our own experts, black and white, must be allowed to come
back and apply their knowledge to build Africa. We must stop the brain
drain.

I could count thousands of top minds who have fled the continent,
voluntarily or otherwise, because of the corruption, repression and
mindless policies of our so-called leaders. There are millions of young
Africans scattered all over Europe and America, roaming the streets or
engaged in menial and degrading jobs, all in an effort to survive.

What Africa needs is a spark of the new agenda. It is not only multiparty
elections but a total democratisation of the political, social and economic
landscape of Africa. From schools through households to governments, there
must be a new spirit of enthusiasm for democracy, empowerment,
accountability, social justice, equality, respect for human rights, popular
participation and a guarantee of freedom and liberties.

How much confidence does the President engender if he governs from the seat
of a R300 000 jet high above the earth? [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I would like to take this opportunity, in case I
miss it, to recognise Aunt Sophie de Bruin, who is sitting in the gallery.
She is the only survivor of the four leaders of the women who led the march
to the Union Buildings on 9 August 1956. [Applause.]

Mr M E MABETA: Madam Speaker, Deputy President and hon members of
Parliament, an African vision is beginning to dominate the lexicon of
African politics. President Mbeki has been religiously preaching the
concept of an African Renaissance. Our own Speaker, Dr Frene Ginwala, has
played a leading role in the development of the Constitutive Act of the
African Union! Some African political leaders are reviving Nkrumah's idea
of a united states of Africa, and the world is focusing on the African
problems of economic and political collapse and the consequent tragic
conflicts plaguing an ever-increasing number of regions.

The UDM is happy to join the hon member Dr Pheko in debating one of the
strategies for addressing these conditions, so eloquently described by the
hon member Mr Feinstein last week in his speech. These conditions involve
poverty, misery, disease and political instability.

Referring to these, the late President of Tanzania, President Nyerere,
commented that together, or even in groups, we are much less weak. We have
the capability to help each other in many ways, each gaining in the
process. As a combined group, we can meet the wealthy nations on very
different terms for, though they may not need any one of us to help their
economies, they cannot cut themselves off from all of us.

However, the success of all our Pan-African strategies must ultimately
depend on our ability to level the playing fields at home. We must, for
example, deal with the problem of emigration by developing economic
strategies that will enhance the economic growth of our neighbours and,
thus, structure a balanced economic environment capable of sustaining
political, regional communities such as SADC. This is the true spirit of
Pan-Africanism. This is the comparative moral basis of Pan-African
solidarity.

Our country must develop African policies that will avoid partisan
positions in dealing with foreign conflicts. We must develop clear policies
on such issues as arms trade, so that our arms do not end up being in the
very theatres in which we attempt to broker peace or promote the African
Renaissance, African interests or vice versa, the interests of those who
have, in the first place, been responsible for the imperialist domination
of African countries. The basis for our intervention, for example, in
regional conflicts must not undermine our capacity to play peacekeeping
roles in our own continent.
Iyaziwa nje into yokuba umfo wenu ngumfo wenu, umhlobo wakho ngumhlobo

umhlobo wakho lowo, anilwi caleni linye. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph
follows.)

[It is generally known that your brother is your brother and your friend is
your friend, and these people will never attack you behind your back. If
one does that, then both of you know that you are no longer friends. You
are opponents.]

It is the moral responsibility of all African states to act in a manner
that, in every way, promotes and uplifts the idea of Pan-African
responsibility and Pan-African collective survival. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Mrs M A A NJOBE: Madam Speaker, the role of Pan-Africanism as a compass for
the restoration of Africa's dignity, prosperity and power was first
recognised during the very formative years of the movement by the leaders
of the African diaspora. Dr W E Dubois, for example, identified the Pan-
African movement as an aid to the promotion of national self-determination
among Africans under African leadership, for the benefit of Africans
themselves.

We of this country have no doubt who an African is. In his I-am-an-African
speech, President Thabo Mbeki clearly identified an African as he or she
whose home is Africa, and he or she who identifies with the African
continent. He reminded us that the South African Constitution is an
unequivocal statement that, as South Africans, we refuse to accept that our
Africanness should be defined by our race, colour, gender or historical
origins.

Founded in 1912, the ANC preceded all other liberation movements in Africa
in adopting and promoting the ideas of Pan-Africanism. Recognition of this
fact is illustrated by the adoption of the then ANC's national anthem Nkosi
sikelel' iAfrica by countries such as Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia and others at
the attainment of their independence.
Charlotte Maxeke, who had studied at Ohio University in the USA, was one of
the champions of Pan-Africanism, in particular among the women of South
Africa. The Freedom Charter's last clause recognises the right of all the
peoples of Africa to independence and self-government, and that this shall
be the basis of close co-operation.
In the 1940s, as the Pan-Africanist movement passed to African leaders such
as Kwame Nkrumah and others, the ANC was not found lacking in promoting Pan-
Africanism. The ANC Youth League at that time, under the leadership of
Anton Lembede, helped to spread Africanist ideas among the youth of
countries such as Uganda, Kenya and others, who happened to be studying at
educational institutions in South Africa at the time.

A Pan-African Congress held in 1945 - and in which the ANC Youth League was
represented, though not by its top leadership, who were refused passports
by the South African government - demanded a vote for all men and women
over the age of 21. It demanded universal free education and full civil
rights for everyone, regardless of colour. Their resolution ended with the
slogan ``Mayibuye iAfrika'' [May Africa return].

The problem of the colour line, as a problem of the 20th century, was also
identified by earlier Pan-Africanists. The statement of the ANC on 8
January 2000 goes further and argues that the challege of the 21st century
is the resolution of the problem of the colour line. Yet, the problem of
patriarchal gender relations transcends the historical epoch of the
development of societies. It is a problem that remains unsolved.

The relationship between race, class and gender in colonial and
postcolonial Africa is well documented. The social formation imposed on
African societies by imperialist powers took away even the limited sphere
of influence and power women had. Colonialism led to a situation where
women were marginalised from social production. Women were perceived to
play the role of reproduction and maintaining households, where resources
were increasingly diminishing. Men, on the other hand, were drawn into wage
slavery as cheap labour.

The perpetuation of oppressive gender relations continues even in
postcolonial Africa. Although there is progressive legislation in place in
a number of African states, legislation which improves the role and status
of women in society, in many cases still has to translate itself into
sustainable programmes to eradicate gender oppression.

Let me, however, quickly acknowledge that work is being done to improve the
status of women. Such efforts are contributing positively to the situation
of women and children. South Africa provides a very good example of this,
under the leadership of an ANC-led Government.

However, advances made are being undermined by the wars that are endemic on
our continent. The military coups and violent conflicts on the continent
result in the disempowerment of women. Illiteracy, violence against women
and abuse of children do not make the situation any better. Many women and
children have lost their limbs in strife-torn countries.

The danger posed by antipersonnel landmines is threatening the very basis
of existence of many households and productive land. This affects many
women-led households. However, current efforts to ensure that peace
prevails on the African continent is, therefore, an important step in
improving the situation of women in postcolonial Africa.

In his address to the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs in Abuja,
in the year 2000, President Thabo Mbeki observed, and I quote:


  An important and critical element of the African Renaissance is that in
  the last few years we have witnessed a widespread awakening in all parts
  of our continent.

He further observed, and I quote:


  Critical to this democratic renaissance in many parts of Africa, has been
  the role of the masses of our people acting through their formations, who
  have fought to end destructive and undemocratic systems.

The point the President is emphasising here is that this noble idea of the
awakening of the continent must be driven by the masses of the people on
the continent.

The women of the ANC, led by the ANC Women's League, have always responded
to this challenge. Currently, they are actively involved in the process of
rebuilding the Pan-African Women's Congress. Pawo was founded on 31 July
1962 in Dar-es-Salaam, following recommendations made at the All Africa
Women's Congress in 1961. ANC women were represented at this first congress
by Mrs Adelaide Tambo. Later Mrs Resha was posted to Pawo headquarters in
Algeria as our representative.

There were, of course, other representatives from other liberation
movements such as the PAC, Swapo, PLO and so on. Later, Lindiwe Zulu was to
be our representative when the Pawo headquarters were moved to Angola.
Pawo's constitution, in its preamble, recognises that the liberation and
development of Africa is the duty of all the people of the continent. It
also states that the African integration constitutes an irreversible way
for the survival of the continent.

Pawo's objectives support the notion of Pan-Africanism. The ANC believes
that these objectives can be realised if Pawo transforms itself into a
powerful women's movement on the continent. It has the potential to put the
women's agenda at the centre of the African Renaissance. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, as commonly used, the philosophy of Pan-
Africanism does not denote racial exclusion, but is a positive call for a
movement to foster collaboration among all Africans to resist external
domination and control.

In all its manifest forms, it is a recognition that the whole continent
belongs to people of the same descent, namely Africans, who are faced with
a common problem, colonialism, and who need the same remedy to fight
together in unity. The philosophy also recognises that the colonialisation
of Africa has taken various forms, overt and covert. It is a call,
therefore, for the rejection of all forms of political, cultural and
economic hegemony imposed on the continent by external forces.

However, it is important to note that some African leaders, even during
slave trading times, connived with the colonialists through greed, to
oppress their own people. Indeed, post independence, the number of such
leaders has increased. Today, colonialism and foreign domination have taken
more sophisticated forms, largely economic, for example through the WTO,
World Bank, IMF and media. Most African leaders are looting national
resources and storing them away in foreign countries. Indeed, greed is at
the root of all conflicts on the continent, whether foreigners have
collaborated or not.

Key points to consider if the continent is to be restored are: The
development of independent African thought, for example schools and
universities that develop African genius; addressing landlessness among
rural Africans, including the introduction of title deeds; releasing
genuine African entrepreneurship; strengthening African union through
denouncing dictators' undemocratic governance and promoting multiparty
democracy; education and training to develop leadership, and freedom of
religion.

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, the motion reads: ``To restore Africa's
dignity.'' How do we restore Africa's dignity? We restore Africa's dignity
by restoring the dignity of the people of Africa.

To be in time for this debate, I started out very early this morning in the
North West province. The Setswana-speaking people of the North West would
say, in their own language: ``Go tsoga le dinaledi'', ie to start with the
stars. What a beautiful way to say I started out early.
A small African child is taught this language as he goes to school, singing
Setswana songs. Then, in Grade 4, this child is told that his African
language is not good enough to become educated in. His education must be in
English, a European language. What is this child told? He is told that his
language is not good enough. He is told that he is not good enough. How is
his dignity restored with such a message?

Afrikaners verstaan hierdie probleem. Jare lank is Afrikaans 'n kombuistaal
genoem. As 'n mens geleerd wou wees, moes 'n mens Engels of Hooghollands
kon skryf en praat. As 'n mens durf Afrikaans praat in die skool, het 'n
mens 'n bord om die nek gekry met `donkie' daarop geskryf, want 'n mens het
dan die taal gepraat wat in Afrika gebore en na Afrika genoem is.

Die Vryheidsfront glo dat mense nie vry is as hulle nie ook kultureel vry
is nie. Waarom kan ons nie rekenaars bou in isiZulu nie? Waarom kan ons nie
atome splyt in Setswana nie? Solank Afrika nie hierdie probleme aanpak nie,
sal die ``dignity'', die waardigheid, nie terugkeer nie.

Afrika, wat 'n pragtige vasteland; Afrika, 'n vasteland met meer as genoeg
natuurlike hulpbronne soos water, grond en goeie klimaat; Afrika, geseënd
met meer as genoeg minerale; Afrika, met al die potensiaal om 'n
internasionale rolspeler te kan wees, tog raak Afrika agter.

Hoekom? Omdat Afrika polities onstabiel bly. Kom ons los Afrika se probleme
op met Afrika se eie oplossings - oplossings wat voorsiening maak vir die
eiesoortige probleme van Afrika en wat al die tale, al die kulture en al
die etniese groepe ook in eiesoortige oplossings kan saamsnoer en daardeur
die ``dignity'', die waardigheid, en die eer van mense kan
herstel.(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Afrikaners understand this problem. For years Afrikaans was called a
kitchen language. If one wished to be educated, one had to be able to write
and speak English or High Dutch. If one dared to speak Afrikaans at school,
one had to wear a board round one's neck with the word ``dunce'' written on
it, because one had spoken the language which was born in Africa and named
after Africa.

The Freedom Front believes that people are not free unless they are also
free culturally. Why can we not manufacture computers in isiZulu? Why can
we not split atoms in Setswana? For as long as Africa does not deal with
these problems, the dignity will not return.

Africa, what a beautiful continent; Africa, a continent with more than
enough natural resources such as water, land and a good climate; Africa,
blessed with more than enough minerals; Africa, with all the potential to
be an international role-player; and yet Africa is lagging behind.

Why? Because Africa remains politically unstable. Let us resolve Africa's
problems with Africa's own solutions - solutions that make provision for
the unique problems of Africa and that can also unite all the languages,
all the cultures and all the ethnic groups in unique solutions and in this
way restore the dignity and the honour of people.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, the desire and passion to integrate
Africa and undo the damage done to her for the past century finally paid
off with the advent of the establishment of Pan-Africanism. For the first
time, Africa would be able to determine her own future as a united
continent bounded by a common desire to find a long-lasting solution to her
seemingly unending problems without any interference from outsiders.

However, there is much that still needs to be done, if we are to make the
proposed institution effective. We also need the involvement and
participation of ordinary citizens and structures of civil society in
influencing and shaping the nature and form of the proposed Pan-Africanism.
It would be a grave mistake if we created institutions that would be
Western in format as a result of neglecting views and opinions of ordinary
Africans. It would be ideal and realistic to embark on public education
throughout the continent about the proposed Pan-Africanism. The time has
come for Africa to take its rightful place in global politics, and there is
no doubt about. We must forge ahead in restoring Africa's past glory.

Pan-Africanism will be an advantage to the African agenda globally in terms
of being aware of the socioeconomic and political situation of member
states, and as to how we are perceived as a continent. It is indeed a
formidable challenge to establish an institution of this magnitude. The Pan-
Africanism proposal has to clarify its role unambiguously, taking into
account the sovereignty and circumstances of member states - the issues
commonly raised during the summit in Libya.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, Pan-Africanism was founded by Sylvester
Williams, a Trinidad-born barrister, in July 1900. He stated that he wanted
to bring into closer touch with each other the peoples of African descent
throughout the world.

Pan-Africanism is a people's movement, a struggle against the unjust and
unlawful oppression of black people. Oppressed and exploited as slaves,
these people survived the horror of the plantations and kept alive
important elements of the African culture through the generations. From
this experience of oppression and humiliation emerged a new generation of
African leaders. Such leaders dreamed of seeing the nation freed of outside
rule and of restoring a sense of pride in the people's African identity.

Pan-Africanism should not be seen as a protest by the continent against
colonisation. It should be seen as Africa taking responsibility for its own
unique problems, many of which resulted from the colonisation of the early
years. It is part of a broader economic developmental agenda which stresses
African solutions to African problems. Pan-Africanism is an authentic
search for the roots of African heritage emerging in its modernised form in
the third millennium.

The MF supports the African Renaissance programme and the current
Millennium African Recovery Programme, Marp, announced recently by
President Mbeki, which aims to give substance to the strategic organisation
of Africa's recovery programme. Pan-Africanism should strive to achieve
movement towards liberty, consolidation of unity, for example South-South
consolidation; people-centred socioeconomic systems, and mass organisation
for empowerment.

In order to achieve a maturing goal of economic empowerment of South
Africa, the fundamental building blocks of democracy, peace and security,
and an economic policy should be in place. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, the seventh Pan-African
congress which was held in April 1994 in Kampala, Uganda, managed to bring
together Africans from all corners of our continent and the diaspora. They
came from governments, academia and other forms of civil organisations. It
was, indeed, an impressive gathering of Africans that assessed the damage
done to us as a race and continent by slavery and colonisation. The damage
done to us was psychological, physical, economic and cultural.

Our forced labour as slaves or as poorly paid labourers, coupled with the
plundering of the natural resources of our continent, played a big role in
the development and enrichment of Europe and North America, hence the call
by that Pan-African congress for reparations to be paid to us. But, above
all, it was recognised by all of us that it is only through solidarity,
unity and collective action that we can restore our dignity, personality
and pride. To do that effectively requires that we banish the colonial
mentality from our midst. And that, in turn, requires that we swallow
generous doses of Pan-Africanism.

We are fortunate that, throughout the history of our continent, we always
had a good crop of leaders imbued with the spirit of Pan-Africanism. The
formation of the OAU and its commitment to the liberation of every corner
of Africa testify to this. The recent decision by the OAU to move towards
the formation of an African Union, complete with its own parliament and
underpinned by an African economic union, tells us that Pan-Africanism is
on the rise. We are pleased that our own country is in the thick of things,
participating fully in these events that are bound to improve our lives and
raise our profile and status in the world. [Applause.]

Mr E M SIGWELA: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, comrades and hon members,
the idea of Pan-Africanism cannot be understood from the context of a
particular political party or organisation. It is not encapsulated in any
specific political formation. Of course, various parties can give it their
own slant and understand it from their world view or perspective.

Pan-Africanism is a movement that has its origin, growth and character in
the historical experiences of the African people. It is an anticolonialist
and anti-imperialist movement that sprouted from the ground of the bitter
experiences of slavery, colonialism and imperialism by Africans. It is a
direct reaction to, and the antithesis of, the systems of brutality such as
slavery, colonialist conquests and imperialist exploitation.

It is not a paradox, therefore, that the gestation and birth of the idea of
Pan-Africanism took place in the Americas, particularly in the United
States, amongst leaders of the African slaves who had been liberated in the
latter half of the 19th century. It was there that the idea of going back
to Africa was hatched to free it from European colonialists, developing it
to be a giant among continents.

It was in the Back to Africa Movement led by Marcus Garvey that the slogan
``Africa for Africans'' became a rallying call. It is significant to note
that this movement by African Americans was anticolonialist and anti-
imperialist in nature and content. Equally significant was a developmental
approach in its main objectives, that is, it aimed to use whatever skills
had been acquired in America for the development of Africa.

This was the motivation of those African-American leaders such as Mr
Williams, Dr Dubois and others who called the first Pan-African Conference
in London in 1900, where the main emphasis was anti-imperialism. Even
though this conference and others after it, were held either in Paris or
London, it is significant that several African students from African soil
were exposed to the ideas of Pan-Africanism. By 1945, there was already a
large crop of African leaders who were able to participate in the 5th Pan-
African Congress in Manchester, Britain. This was also the congress where
the ANC's own Prof Z K Mathews participated. That is where great African
leaders such as Dr Kwame Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta, Leopold Senghor and
Houphouet-Boigny also participated.

After this congress, it was clear that the idea of Pan-Africanism had been
effectively planted on African soil. At this congress, the following
resolution was taken:


  We are determined to be free, we want education, we want the right to
  earn a decent living, the right to express our thoughts and emotions, to
  adopt and create forms of beauty. We demand for black Africa autonomy and
  independence. We will fight in every way we can for freedom, democracy
  and social betterment.

Lest I be guilty of an omission, I want to state that the 1945 conference
was not the first time that the ANC had come into contact with the Pan-
African movement. During the last decade of the 19th century and the first
decade of the 20th century, the founding fathers and mothers of the ANC
spent some time in centres of the USA such as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
Ohio and others, where they encountered this movement. This was the time
also - if we know our own South African history - when the first corps of
mission-educated Africans were beginning to challenge the system of
government that existed in our own country, leading to the establishment of
the ANC. In fact, the development of our history during this period shows
that the ANC was fuelled by contact with this movement.

We in the ANC are also proud of having been part of the various endeavours
towards African unity. After the independence of Ghana in 1957, when Dr
Nkrumah called the first Pan-African Conference on African soil in Accra -
in December 1958 - the ANC participated. It was heartening to find our
representative - before Comrade Tennyson became a renegade - participating
in the steering committee for Pan-African Unity, established in Casablanca
in 1959. By means of this little history, I am trying to show that, even
though our slant and our interpretation of Africanism may have been
misunderstood by others to mean that we rejected a narrow Africanist
outlook, we were part of this movement because we understood clearly what
its objectives were.

At this juncture I must also state that the Pan-Africanist movement enjoyed
the broad support of the progressive forces in the socialist countries, as
well as that of the International Communist movement and the Nonaligned
Movement. This was not a mistake or something that just happened by chance.
One of the fundamental principles of the Communist Internationale in 1919
was that, to succeed in the struggle against imperialism - which Lenin said
was at a higher stage of capitalism - there had to be a strengthening of
national liberation movements in the countries where they existed and the
founding of those movements where they did not exist, thus consolidating
the whole anticolonialist and anti-imperialist movement.

It is therefore not surprising that our own party, the SACP, has always
stood by the ANC in its support for the Pan-Africanist movement. The
African Renaissance should also be seen in this context of developing and
freeing Africa from the vestiges of colonialism and imperialism, and
rallying all of us to deliver on what we have always promised, ie the
realisation of development for Africa. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, the Berlin Conference on Africa brought
together the main powers of the time. They disagreed on many points, but
they were agreed on the balkanisation of our continent. Now, more than 100
years after that event, Africa - weakened, impoverished and exploited - is
still arguing about how we can recover our dignity and reverse this
unfortunate situation.

I want to say that, on the whole, the positiveness of this debate today has
encouraged us. I think it is a sign of hope that we may be getting
somewhere and very soon. The problem that we face is the question of an
identity crisis. There are far too many Africans who do not know who they
are and what they are, and that is a problem. One cannot be an African and
be a non-African at the same time.

I salute the hon Turok, who has converted to Africanism. Nobody can tell
him that he is an African or committed to it - it burns in his bones. If it
is there, nobody can stop it. One must go and ask Dr Costa Gazi, Dr Van Zyl
Slabbert and Breyten Breytenbach. They say it burns in their bones. It is
high time that this identity crisis ended. People who are black and white
Africans must become Africans, and it should begin to burn in their bones.
Nobody will label them, because they know who they are.

I want to say, as clearly as I can, that we need to call a summit to
clarify the concepts that are being mentioned here. What is Pan-Africanism?
What is the African Renaissance? What are we talking about? What are the
commonalities? Where are the differences? We have to interrogate that. I
believe that we have to call to account some of the things that the hon
Sikwela says he has believed in for a long time, particularly about the
narrow and the broad understanding of Africanism. These concepts have to be
interrogated.

Finally, I just want to say that our success in Africa depends on our
success here at home. If there is no unity here at home, we cannot go
anywhere else and talk about African unity. We have to begin to have
African unity here at home. We have to practise it. It has got to be real.
If it is not real here, it will not be real anywhere else. One can attend a
thousand conferences, but if, indeed, one does not believe in unity and one
does not practise it where one lives, nobody is going to believe it. They
will just be empty words.
I just wanted to say that we honour Lembede and Nyerere - I attended his
funeral, and it was pleasing to find that all the people were praising
Nyerere because of his Pan-African outlook and his commitment to Pan-
Africanism. That, I believe, is the way forward, and all of us must know
that if we go that way, we are likely to get somewhere.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Dr M S MOGOBA: Yes?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I regret your time has long expired. [Laughter.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: I wanted to preach a little bit!

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 16:40.
