                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr A MLANGENI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
   That the House -
   (1)      notes -
        (a)      the appointment of President Thabo Mbeki as the honorary
              chairperson of the prestigious President's Cup Golf event to
              be held in Fancourt, South Africa, in 2002; and
        (b)      that President Mbeki is only the fifth person to be
              accorded this accolade after Gerald Ford, George Bush Sr and
              Bill Clinton, and only the second non-American, after John
              Howard of Australia;
   (2)      believes this is an important recognition of our President's
        formidable stature, and a milestone for South African sport in the
        world sporting arena;
   (3)      wishes the organisers of the unique tournament, where the
        golfers are not paid and all profits are given to charity, every
        success; and
   (4)      congratulates the President on his appointment.
[Applause.]
Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:
   That the House -
   (1)      notes -
        (a)      the failure of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Filling of
              Vacancies in the Commission for Gender Equality to short-list
              Ms Rhoda Kadalie;
        (b)      the international recognition Ms Kadalie enjoys as a
              gender expert and activist; and
        (c)      her excellent work as a Human Rights Commissioner and the
              independence of judgment that makes her so suitable a
              candidate for the constitutional watchdog bodies; and
   (2)      deplores the omission and exhorts the committee to reconsider
        her exclusion.
[Interjections.]
Mrs I MARS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:
   That the House -
   (1)      supports the President's positive response to an urgent appeal
        from the Mozambiquan authorities for assistance for an estimated
        200 000 flood victims, and expresses the wish that this
        humanitarian mission, which is to be undertaken by the SA National
        Defence Force, will be as successful as last year's much-lauded
        operation;
   (2)      expresses its sympathy with those who suffer loss of lives and
        livelihood; and
   (3)      prays for the safe return of all our people deployed in this
        important mission.
[Applause.]
Mr N B FIHLA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
   That the House -
   (1)      notes -
        (a)      the riotous behaviour of 30 000 rugby fans in the
              aftermath of Saturday's Super 12 match between the Stormers
              and the Cats at Newlands rugby grounds; and
        (b)      that DA councillors banned soccer from being played at
              Newlands because of the supposed noise 2 000 soccer fans
              would have made;
   (2)      condemns the unbecoming and reprehensible behaviour of these
        rugby fans, and the fact that, despite this horrific behaviour,
        rugby is still being played at Newlands without a murmur of
        discontent; and
   (3)      believes that the decision to ban soccer from Newlands is
        motivated by the particularly vicious kind of racism found in the
        Western Cape.
[Applause.]
Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move:
   That the House -
   (1)      notes with regret that, due to a perception that the SAPS can no
        longer protect them, communities are increasingly taking the law
        into their own hands;
   (2)      condemns, in the strongest possible terms, all forms of
        vigilantism; and
   (3)      urges the Government to empower and equip the SAPS to fulfil
        their constitutional duty to protect and secure the inhabitants of
        the Republic of South Africa and their property.
Chief N Z MTIRARA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:
   That the House -
   (1)      notes the major concern of the amakhosi, who would like to help
        in building a new society in South Africa;
   (2)      acknowledges that the UDM is perturbed that the majority party
        did not nominate any traditional leader to participate in the
        debate on a matter that affected traditional leadership but,
        instead, preferred to nominate a Member of Parliament who could
        not, by any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as an authority
        on the matter of chieftainship or be a duly accredited nominee of
        the traditional leaders' structure; and
   (3)      expresses its dissatisfaction with this anomaly and urges the
        majority party to refrain from such behaviour in future.
Mr M T GONIWE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
   That the House -
   (1)      notes -
        (a)      that one of the founding principles of South Africa's
              constitutional democracy is a Bill of Rights with particular
              reference to social security, food, water and health care;
        (b)      the rights of nations to self-determination and national
              sovereignty;
        (c)      that the insistent sanctions against Iraq, and attacks on
              and bombardments of Iraq by the United States and Britain are
              attacks not only on Iraqi sovereignty, but on helpless
              children and women; and
        (d)      that the "big brother" attitude of the US denies other
              countries their sovereign rights by blocking air flights to
              Iraq, and that the actions of the US are not in keeping with
              the UN Security Council's resolutions in respect of Iraq; and
   (2)      calls on the UN to act swiftly to stop the US from destroying
        the socioeconomic fabric of Iraq and to restore the integrity of
        the UN itself.
[Applause.]
Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the PAC:
   That the House -
   (1)      notes -
        (a)      with dismay the violation of Iraq's territorial integrity
              and sovereignty by Britain and the USA, by bombing in which
              innocent civilians were killed;
        (b)      that the USA and Britain are both permanent members of the
              supreme body of the United Nations, the Security Council, and
              must therefore conduct themselves in a manner worthy of their
              membership;
        (c)      that their lecturing the countries of the South about the
              rule of law, peace and stability must be doubted until they
              practise what they preach;
        (d)      that the PAC condemns the aggression against Iraq, which
              is a violation of international law; and
   (2)      appeals to the United Nations member states not to allow their
        rights to be usurped by Britain and the USA, and to call on these
        two aggressors against Iraq to observe the United Nations Charter
        of which they are signatories.
[Applause.]
Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die AEB sal voorstel:
   Dat die Huis -
   (1)      afkeuring daarvan uitspreek dat ouers van kinders wat deur die
        polisie vervolg is oor die gebruik van dagga dit as 'n onbenullige
        misdaad afmaak en die polisie van kwaadwillige vervolging
        beskuldig;
   (2)      van mening is dat ouers en kinders daarvan moet kennis neem dat
        die gebruik van dagga of ander verdowingsmiddels volgens die
        landswette 'n kriminele oortreding is;
   (3)      alle ouers in Suid-Afrika aanmoedig om hul Godgegewe roeping
        getrou te vervul en die gees van vrye losbandigheid en morele
        verval onder ons jeug te bestry;
   (4)      die onmisbare waarde van gesonde dissipline onder ons jeug sal
        bevestig en die gees van losbandigheid sal beveg; en
   (5)      die Minister versoek om nie in te gryp in die huishoudelike
        reëls van skole nie, reëls wat ingebed is in trotse tradisies, en
        gesonde dissipline en groepsverbondenheid bevorder, gedagtig
        daaraan dat as kinders kan lyk soos hulle wil en aantrek wat hulle
        wil, hulle naderhand ook wil rook wat hulle wil.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)
[Mr C Aucamp: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the AEB:
   That the House -
   (1)      expresses its condemnation of the fact that parents of children
        who have been prosecuted by the police for having used dagga are
        shrugging this off as a minor misdemeanour and are accusing the
        police of malicious prosecution;
   (2)      is of the opinion that parents and children should take note
        that in terms of the country's laws the use of dagga or other drugs
        is a criminal offence;
   (3)      urges all parents in South Africa loyally to perform their God-
        given duty to combat the spirit of licentiousness and moral decay
        among our youth;
   (4)      confirms the essential value of healthy discipline among our
        youth and will combat the spirit of licentiousness; and
   (5)      requests the Minister not to intervene in the internal rules of
        schools - rules which are embedded in proud traditions and which
        promote healthy discipline and group loyalty - mindful of the fact
        that if children may look as they wish and wear what they wish,
        they will eventually also want to smoke whatever they wish to.]
Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
   That the House -
   (1)      notes -
        (a)      reports that the President will get an executive, yet
              basic, jet;
        (b)      that this House adopted the Defence Review which included
              a section on VIP transport and the need for the upgrading
              thereof; and
        (c)      that no party in the House expressed delight at the plight
              of the President when he had to hitchhike to an international
              meeting;
   (2)      believes that the recent objections by the DP on the acquisition
        of this jet reflect double standards, inconsistencies and political
        opportunism; and
   (3)      welcomes the move to acquire a new jet for the President of the
        Republic so that he can perform his constitutional duties
        effectively.
[Applause.]
Mr D K MALULEKE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:
   That the House -
   (1)      notes that President Nelson Mandela slammed some leading members
        of the ANC for unhelpful comments by them, which are breeding
        insecurity among minority groups, and that he criticised these
        leading members of the ANC for not being nation-builders ...
[Interjections.]
   (2)      calls on senior members of the Government and the on-line
        publication the ANC Today to refrain from inciting racial hatred
        with comments and statements aimed at certain minorities, racial or
        cultural groups; and
   (3)      accepts that racism practised by whites and blacks alike must be
        condemned, and thereby endorses the sentiments expressed by Mr
        Mandela that South Africa belongs to all who live in it - black and
        white.
[Interjections.]
Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the IFP:
   That the House -
   (1)      notes with due delight that UN observers will soon be deployed
        in the DRC in preparation for the withdrawal of foreign forces
        aiding either the DRC or the Tutsi rebels living in the DRC;
   (2)      applauds the Rwandan and Ugandan troops for agreeing on a 15 km
        pullback with effect from 15 March 2001;
   (3)      compliments the attempts at peace by President Joseph Kabila,
        despite his undemocratic accession to power, aimed at resolving the
        two-and-a-half year war in the Great Lakes Region; and
   (4)      welcomes his humble and humane overture in accepting Sir
        Ketumile Masire's mediation credentials with a possible resumption
        of such position by Sir Ketumile Masire.
Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order: The last two
motions of which notice has been given have been virtually inaudible. May I
ask that something be done about the sound system?
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes, I have already addressed that matter. There does
seem to be some problem with the sound system, but it is being attended to.
Mr L T LANDERS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
   That the House -
   (1)      notes -
        (a)      the omnipresent divisions and recent upsurge in tensions
              in the DA caucus;
        (b)      that the basis of the conflict between the New NP and the
              DP, according to DA Members of Parliament, is the
              undemocratic, authoritarian and autocratic leadership style
              of the hon Lance Corporal Tony Leon and his tendency to treat
              MPs like children ...
[Laughter.]
        (c)      that the hon Lance Corporal Leon purports to support press
              freedom, but exposed his own propensity to lecture
              journalists when he launched a scathing personal attack on a
              journalist who wrote an unfavourable article about him; and
   (2)      calls on the voters of South Africa to distance themselves from
        this unworkable alliance, with its centralist-Stalinist leader.
[Applause.]
Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:
   That the House notes with concern that -
   (1)      despite the harm it is likely to do to the South African
        economy, the Minister has decided to implement the Capital Gains
        Tax in October, which may well inhibit fixed investment and job
        creation;
   (2)      CGT will be costly and extremely complex to administer;
   (3)      no allowance is made for inflation-related gains; and
   (4)      since income derived from trading activity has been subject to
        income tax all along, the view that CGT will result in progress on
        equity grounds is highly questionable.

                           FOETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr D H M GIBSON: Mevrou die Speaker, ek stel hiermee sonder kennisgewing
voor:
   Dat die Huis: -
   (1)      kennis neem van die voortslepende probleem van fetale
        alkoholsindroom, veral ná die skokkende onthulling dat 'n ses
        maande oue baba in Uitsig gevind is met 'n bloedalkoholvlak vyf
        keer hoër as die toelaatbare vlak in 'n volwasse motorbestuurder;
   (2)      kennis neem dat die slagoffers van fetale alkoholsindroom aan
        ernstige gebreke ly, waaronder dwerggroei en probleme met eet,
        slaap, gehoor, sig en leer;
   (3)      verder kennis neem dat alkoholmisbruik endemies in benadeelde
        gemeenskappe is en in sekere gebiede tot 15% van kinders wat
        skoolgereed is aan fetale alkoholsindroom ly; en
   (4)      dus 'n beroep op alle betrokkenes doen, op watter valk van
        regering ook al, om die probleem van dié siekte in ons samelewing
        aan te pak.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)
[Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:
    That the House: -
    (1)     notes the recurring problem of foetal alcohol syndrome after
          the shocking disclosure that a six-month-old baby was found in
          Uitsig with a blood-alcohol level five times that permitted in an
          adult driver;
    (2)     notes that victims of foetal alcohol syndrome suffer from major
          handicaps, including stunted growth and problems with eating,
          sleeping, hearing, seeing and learning;
    (3)     further notes that alcohol abuse is endemic in disadvantaged
          societies and in some areas up to 15% of entry-level school
          children have foetal alcohol syndrome; and
    (4)     therefore resolves to call on all concerned, at whatever level
          of government, to address this scourge in our society.]
Agreed to.
 APPEAL FOR RESCUE SERVICES TO HELP FLOOD VICTIMS IN MOZAMBIQUE, MALAWI AND
                                  ZIMBABWE
                             (Draft Resolution)
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:
   That the House -
   (1)      notes that -
        (a)      floods have again struck in Mozambique and in some parts
              of Malawi and Zimbabwe; and
        (b)      these floods have destroyed property and threaten the life
              of ordinary people; and
   (2)      calls on the international community to provide rescue services
        to people caught in floods.
Agreed to.
                         DEATH OF SIR DONALD BRADMAN
                             (Draft Resolution)
Mr C T FROLICK: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:
   That the House -
   (1)      expresses its condolences with the Australian nation and the
        family of the late Sir Donald Bradman, who has passed away at the
        age of 92;
   (2)      notes that ``The Don'' was the most prolific run-scorer and
        greatest batsman in test cricket history, amassing 6 996 test runs
        at an unrivalled average of 99,94; and
   (3)      acknowledges the immense contribution ``The Don'' made to the
        gentlemen's game with his sportmanship and unique talent.
Agreed to.
         NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES BILL
                           (Second Reading debate)
The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Madam Speaker,
library and information services, or what we generally refer to as LIS, is
at the centre of the information revolution. South African society,
including the LIS sector, is being transformed in a concerted effort to
eliminate past injustices and inequities. The library and information
services sector is facing tremendous challenges that need to be overcome in
order to promote democracy and the socioeconomic development of our
country.
These challenges include raising low levels of literary and information
literacy; promoting a culture of reading and life-long learning;
stimulating the publishing industry to publish more works of both fiction
and nonfiction in African languages in order for South Africa to become a
nation of readers; and transforming services and library collections to
answer the needs of all communities.
The council is, therefore, to be established in order to advise Government
on the transformation of the library and information services sector, to
ensure that the needs of all communities are addressed in a co-ordinated
manner and in partnership with my colleague, the hon the Minister of
Education, and the provinces, hence the tabling of the legislation before
this House.
This Bill is a result of wide consultation between my department and the
Department of Education, on the one hand, and various players in the
library and information services sector on the other. These players include
the National Library of South Africa, the legal deposit libraries,
provincial library services, provincial government departments responsible
for library and information services, metropolitan library services, the
Committee of University Librarians, the Committee of Technikon Librarians,
the Library and Information Association of South Africa, departments of
library and information science at universities and technikons, and many
others.
Two important reports published by my department, and which served as
points of departure for further discussion, lay the theoretical foundation
for an advisory council for library and information services in South
Africa. The first one was a White Paper on Arts, Culture and Heritage of
1996, which recommended that such a council be established to assist in the
formulation of library and information services policy, to provide co-
ordinating networks and mechanisms, and to set priorities for extending
national library and information services. The council was to provide a
vehicle for co-ordination at the national level and advice on linkages
between the national and provincial governments.
The second report, published in 1997, was a result of an investigation by
an interministerial working group into the library and information services
functions at the national level. The purpose of the investigation was to
advise me and the Minister of Education on appropriate mechanisms, to
ensure good governance of the library and information services at the
national level and to facilitate maximum availability and use of all
relevant information services to advance the reconstruction and development
programme.
One of the recommendations of the working group was that an advisory
council for library and information services be established. The report of
the working group pointed out that the impetus for the establishment of the
council could be traced back to the existence of previous councils, namely
the National Advisory Council on Libraries and Information which existed
from 1967 to 1982, the National Library Advisory Council, which existed
from 1982 to 1986, and other reports on policy development initiatives and
investigations of the early 1990s, that indicated that a need for a council
to co-ordinate a fragmented and often marginalised sector was stronger than
ever before.
That need was reaffirmed and confirmed by the investigation of the
interministerial working group seen within the context of using access to
information to strengthen our newly democratised society. Constraints
resulting from the Constitution, which provides the legislative framework
within which library and information services are to be provided, demanded
that the body should be an advisory one.
The object of the National Council for Library and Information Services
Bill of 2000 is to establish a council to advise the Minister of Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology and the Minister of Education on matters
relating to library and information services in order to facilitate access
to information for all communities. The council must inform and advise the
minister on matters relating to the development and co-ordination of
library and information services, promotion of co-operation, legislation,
policies to govern allocation of public funds, deficiencies of library and
information services and priorities needed to eliminate them; the promotion
of literacy, a culture of reading and information literacy, and the
utilisation of information technology.
The functions of the council have been formulated broadly in order to
create a proper operational framework for the council and to ensure the
maximum benefit of its activities to all users of libraries and information
services. The functions can be divided into two categories. The first
category pertains to the council's functions in advising the two Ministers
on various aspects of library and information services, including
development, co-ordination and legislation. Of importance will also be
policy formulation regarding the allocation of public funds, training of
library staff and promotion of literacy, a culture of reading and
information literacy. The second category of functions is of a more general
nature, according to which the Council must co-ordinate responses of the
library and information services to problems, liaise with other bodies and
councils, and play an advocacy role.
It will be expected of the proposed council to make sensible and practical
recommendations within the framework of realistic funding possibilities, of
transforming the South African library and information services to the
advantage of all users of information and thereby also to strengthen the
National System of Innovation. The Council will bear a heavy burden of
responsibility, since it will have to ensure that the needs of all
components of the library and information services sector, and the
communities that they serve are considered and brought to the attention of
myself and my colleague, the Minister of Education.
The council will consist of twelve members to be appointed by me, with the
concurrence of the Minister of Education, and after a process of public
nomination. One of the members will be the National Librarian of South
Africa. Liasa, the Library and Information Association of South Africa,
would also be represented on the council in order to facilitate co-
operation between the council and the professional association of the
library and information services sector. Its members will have the
necessary expertise and insight into the totality of all aspects that
affect library and information services delivery and should propose
innovative solutions to long-standing as well as new problems.
The members should therefore be well-informed of the role of information in
society and should have experience in research, development and education
matters pertaining to library and information services. Importantly,
recommendations should always be made in close consultation with all the
communities the council will serve, so that there will be input from grass-
roots level as well.
Library and information services in South Africa should be revitalised from
the bottom up, with the council steering and co-ordinating new ideas and
initiatives for restructuring this sector. Information, and access thereto
through libraries and others means, will play a vital role in furthering
democratisation and promoting human rights and human development in South
Africa, as well as enabling and empowering communities to participate in
the governance system.
According to the Human Development Report 2000 of the United Nations, human
rights and human development share a common vision and a common purpose -
to secure the freedom, the well-being and the dignity of all people
everywhere. The council should have the vision to integrate these local
needs and ideals with those of the global information society, which offers
both advantages and challenges to developing communities. It is therefore
clear that the council will have a challenging and exciting task ahead of
it. I hope that the House will support this Bill. [Applause.]

[Legofi.] (Translation of Setswana speech follows.)
[Ms N M TSHEOLE: Madam Speaker, we have started the year with changes. Can
you allow me to quote the hon the President when he said:
Gradually, step by step, our country proceeds further away from its painful
past. We, its citizens, who are very close to the coalface of change, may
not easily see the steady transformation that informs all aspects of our
national life.
It is true. It is possible that when we draft a Bill on libraries, we take
it for granted, thinking that it is just a Bill that does not affect our
lives. I want to say to hon members, we are living in times of change; we
are changing things that affect our lives. Libraries have links with
education, as the hon the Minister has already indicated. As such, they are
important and affect our lives. When one is close to a fire, smoke gets
into one's eyes and then one fails to see the good things. And at times,
one cannot even feel its heat. It is just like that with us. We know that
people of other countries are looking at us with eagle eyes; they envy us
because of the changes that we are effecting.
To establish a committee that will advise the hon the Minister on aspects
of the libraries is an important point, because we are from a past in which
our people did not have an opportunity to visit libraries. Before I go any
further I want to say that this Bill is one of those in respect of which
one can say that the opposition parties were listening to the hon the
President when he said: ``Let us unite in action for change.''
I do not believe that there will be anyone opposing this Bill. If there is
anyone, they will be people who cannot be trusted. Now, this Bill is one in
respect of which we can encourage each other and say, together we stand and
divided we fall.
Recently, during the elections, I spoke to the women at home, wanting them
to understand that change is difficult. I asked them whether they had sung
in a choir and come across what is known as a transition. Transitional keys
are the ones which determine who will win in the music competitions. We are
in a transition, and such Bills depend on whether we take care of them, and
look after them properly. This Bill seeks our responsibility as members of
Parliament. We must inform our people so that when that council is
established, they should have representatives in it. Their needs and
demands must reach the hon the Minister, as he would advise.
The hon the Minister has said that because of this Bill, the people will
have access to information on many things about which they did not have
information. But, when we look at this Bill which is in agreement with the
policies of the ANC, the first thing that we see is the contributions of
the people. We note that the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology is working together with the Department of Education, because
they are connected by the libraries.
Secondly, this committee cannot be established without consulting the
people so as to give them an opportunity of voicing their opinions. We know
that it is the policy of the ANC that the opinions of the people should be
included in what we are doing, so that we should be able to enrich our
resolutions that we take in Parliament. This Bill also aims at striking a
balance in respect of people's rights. We know that we come from the past.
Our history tells us that our people do not read.
We know that it is possibly a habit that knowledge is passed on by word of
mouth, but now we are in times of change, our children attend school. If
one goes to the rural areas, one will never find a library or children
sitting in a corner with something to read, unlike what we see in towns.
We must inform the parents at home or those in the areas that we represent
that there is such a Bill, and that there will be a committee that will
help our children in rural areas to know that there are computers, books,
and that these can be used. It does not end there. We must influence those
that are able to write to enrich our libraries with their literature. I am
emphasising children because they are the future of our country. Our time
has passed, we are dried wood. I do not know whether we can still be bent.
Whenever we talk, even when we are with the opposition parties, at times
one finds them talking as if, when we talk of change, they want to see it
today. They would want that when they die; they must have seen what change
is like. No, we are fooling ourselves. Let us know that most of the things
that we do today are not intended for us, we are preparing a future for
those coming after us. If we become those that want it for our own benefit,
we will fail. We will be impatient because if we want something to change,
we will want to find ourselves in the middle of that change. That is not
possible. We must disseminate a message of that nature to our people, so
that they should know that we should meet.
I want to make an appeal to the opposition parties that, as we are here to
agree to accept this Bill, as the hon the Minister has requested us to do,
they should go to those they say that they represent, those that cannot
read, those without libraries, and let them know that when announcements
are made in newspapers and on the radio, that representatives are wanted to
stand for their constituencies in this council, they must be able to stand
up. We have already realised that quite often when we have such Bills, our
people do not come to stand for such councils.
As such, even if we accept this Bill with open hearts, we are appealing
that we go outside, as the hon the Minister has said about advocacy. That
would be one of the tasks of the committee that would advise the hon the
Minister. Members must go and inform the people about the importance of
libraries, about what can be achieved with computers, so that we are able
to do the same as other countries. Let us unite, and not become cowards who
are scattered, who are only concerned about who benefits, and who forget
that we are not here to work for our stomachs, but for those who have
elected us and put us here.
On behalf of the ANC I say that this Bill emphasises the hon the
President's message which says, let us unite so as to bring change that
will be beneficial to us, that can be beneficial to us tomorrow. Here is
the Bill, let us accept it, build our nation, teach it, so that even if we
die tomorrow, it will point to our graves with pride. [Applause.]]
Mr R S NTULI: Madam Speaker, hon Ministers and hon members, the object of
this Bill is to establish the National Council for Library and Information
Services, to advise the Minister and the Minister of Education on matters
relating to library and information services.
The DP accepts this Bill and hopes that the Minister and his department
will secure the necessary funding to enforce this Bill, because our
communities, especially black communities, are crying out for information
and education, while the local authorities find themselves in the position
of not being able to render these basic services because of the shortage of
funds.
In the brief time available to me, I would like to focus on the unfortunate
and ongoing lack of delivery of basic access to library and information
services for the vast majority of our people, despite the existence of a
wealth of enabling legislation making provision for redressing the
imbalances of the past. These pieces of legislation include, among others,
the Transvaal Provincial Library and Museum Ordinance of 1982, the Local
Government Transition Act of 1993 and the Local Government: Municipal
Structures Act of 1998.
I would like specifically to focus on the serious lack of library
facilities and resources which many local authorities are still forced to
contend with in this country, particularly in the greater Pretoria
constituency which I represent. Together with the overextended demands on
existing library and information services on the worldwide web, the
extremely high rental fees levied by Telkom SA to gain access to datalines
serve to prevent libraries from rendering rapid, up-to-date and cost-
effective services to the vast majority of community-based libraries.
In the Pretoria/Tshwane area, the amalgamation of Pretoria, Mamelodi and
Atteridgeville has, of necessity, a rise of 110% in the population needing
to be serviced by local libraries, while no additional funding has been
provided to date in the Pretoria budget for operating additional centres.
No budget for libraries has been provided in the areas affected by
amalgamation, very little new infrastructure has been provided in the
townships and the Gauteng government continues to provide library materials
only to previously affiliated libraries in the township areas.
To aggravate matters, the restructuring of the former Pretoria City Council
led to the diminished status of the Pretoria library and information
services, with the result that the financial position of local government
has progressively deteriorated. There is overcrowding of libraries by users
in search of both information and a place to study. A delicate financial
balance always has to be kept between delivering services to existing
community libraries and creating new ones in underprovided areas.
I would like to suggest some ways in which the current lack of provision of
services by libraries could be addressed in practical ways, involving some
of the innovative ventures put forward at a seminar in July 1999 by Mrs
Hansen, the city librarian at the Pretoria community library and
information services. These include community involvement by user-
communities, NGOs and community forums, drawing up a service menu based on
the existing needs, lobbying political decision-makers and other role-
players, partnerships with private sector bodies, joint ventures and
fundraising.
Finally, I agree with Mrs Hansen that the effective use and, hence, overall
survival of community libraries and information services in South Africa
will depend, amongst other things, on the promulgation of legislation that
states clearly that the responsibility for the provision of community
libraries and information services is firmly at local government level.
Equity in service provision must be achieved. National government must have
a policy in place for the development and maintenance of community library
services. Furthermore, information providers should be willing to share
resources at affordable prices. More cost- effective ways to provide
electronic service delivery should be found.
Finally, I should like to close by asking the Minister whether any attempts
have been made by his department to seek additional funds from
international institutions such as the British Council, Unesco or the
European Union. If not, I would urge him to act in this regard at the
earliest opportunity. [Applause.]
Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, I rise with great pleasure on behalf of the
IFP to support the National Council for Library and Information Services
Bill. I do so because if we think of this marvellous story written by Roald
Dahl, Matilda, we have a situation in which the family is devoted to
watching television, but not to reading, and the father has a fit when he
sees his daughter bringing home books.
We know that we in South Africa as a nation are not really a reading
nation. A household survey that was conducted in Australia in 1999
indicated that only about 50% of people over the age of 18 read books
regularly. This is surely a great deficiency in a period in which
information is so critically important to our lives, to our economy and to
everything. Therefore we need to be able to empanel a group of wise and
visionary people, fellow South Africans, who would be passionately driven
to make sure that South Africa is at the very forefront of this information
age, also with respect to reading.
If I had to conjure up a vision of what I would like to see for South
Africa, then I would look to the British Library. The British Library is a
marvellous institution. It has in it 16 million books, 8 million different
types of stamps, 4 million maps, 2,5 million disks for sound and 250 000
manuscripts of those who wish to become writers.
South Africa needs to have a proliferation of writers, especially in the
indigenous languages in order that these previously marginalised languages
can come to the fore and more people can communicate their ideas and,
culturally, this country can make serious progress.
The British Library also has a staff of 2 390 people. This is staggering,
but this is the scale on which the British Library operates, and it is no
wonder that the people who draw references and material from there are
themselves at the cutting edge of societies in the world.
We must also recognise that with the information age more and more people
are resorting to digital technology and, once again, the web site of the
British Library has 10 million hits per annum. That must indicate to us
just how significant a source of information the British Library has been
and why we should put together a panel in our country that will allow us as
a country also to be able to provide our citizens, our schools and our
universities with the kind of information that is needed.
Not only should we be looking at the library as a source of information,
but also in respect of cultural activities, and this is how the Australians
are approaching the concept of libraries. It is part of a cultural
activity, and they have therefore divided it into five different parts in
order that all aspects of culture are adequately catered for and provided
for as a result of their library services.
We have, unfortunately, another very serious impediment and that is that,
no matter what we legislate in this Parliament, the effect will be felt
mainly in the cities. The rural areas, which harbour a very substantial
portion of our population, will continue to be denied access to these most
important instruments that would help to elevate them, to lift them from
the poverty in which they find themselves.
And therefore, once again, we would like to see people on the national
council who will not only regulate matters so that they benefit people who
live in the towns and the cities, but who will also take this out into
remote villages and into the rural areas in order that we can all connect
as South Africans to this great information age via the technology that has
now become available. I am also very supportive of the idea that the
Department of Education and the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology should collaborate extensively in this area, because it touches
the lives of school students as much as the lives of business people and
others.
And if we consider, once again, the British example, there is a great deal
of co-operation and partnership programmes. They use credit cards to access
information of certain types and there is corporate membership. We should
also think of corporate membership for people who have major industries and
factories, in order that they too can bring value to this entire library
system, energise it with the amount of money that they can put into it,
draw the benefits for themselves and allow others to draw equal benefit of
the technical type that their participation would involve.
On behalf of the IFP, I wish to congratulate those who have put the Bill
together. I hope that it is going to succeed marvelously, and that the
Minister will be able to have the kind of a team that he deserves. [Time

Mnr J SCHIPPERS: Mevrou die Speaker, sedert die historiese aantekening van
die oudste biblioteek van koning Sjepseskaf in Giza (2575 vC), en die
rykste en oudste van daardie tyd, naamlik die hofboekery van koning
Ashurbanipal (668-627 vC) in Nineve, tot die hedendaagse ultramoderne
biblioteke in die groot sentra van die wêreld, het biblioteekwese gegroei
en ontwikkel tot 'n moderne wetenskap wat vir elke nasie en land
onontbeerlik is.
Biblioteek- en inligtingsdienste moet die instrument wees waarmee 'n volk
sy geskiedenis en alle fasette van daardie land se bestaan kan navors met
die gebruik van boeke, tydskrifte, vakliteratuur, skriftelike dokumente,
akoestiese dokumente soos grammofoonplate, bandopnames en rolprente. Die
wetsontwerp wat tans voor die Huis dien, is in dié sin belangrik. Dit het
ten doel om 'n raad te vestig wat twee belangrike departemente in die
proses van nasiebou en ontwikkeling in die land bymekaar sal bring, naamlik
die Departement van Kuns, Kultuur, Wetenskap en Tegnologie en die
Departement van Onderwys.
Die belangrikheid van die wetsontwerp lê opgesluit in die funksies van die
raad, naamlik klousule 4 van die wetsontwerp. Klousule 4(1) spesifiseer
duidelik dat die Raad die Ministers van Kuns, Kultuur, Wetenskap en
Tegnologie en van Onderwys eerstens oor verskeie aangeleenthede moet inlig
en tweedens moet dit 'n koördinerende funksie vervul. Dit is belangrik dat
die twee betrokke departemente se werksaamhede ten opsigte van die funksies
van die raad, nie gedupliseer moet word nie. Dit sal 'n vermorsing van tyd,
energie en geld wees.
Suid-Afrika het 'n hoë ongeletterdheidsyfer en alle pogings om daarop te
verbeter, moet juis deur die betrokke departemente aangevoer word. Die
voorgestelde raad moet instrumenteel hierin wees. Samewerking tussen die
inligtingsdienste van die Departement van Kuns, Kultuur, Wetenskap en
Tegnologie en die Education Library and Information Services, Edulis,
behoort 'n kragtige faktor te wees om enersyds die sosio-ekonomiese,
tegnologiese en inligtingsontwikkeling van alle gemeenskappe te stimuleer
en te ondersteun en andersyds om optimale toegang tot relevante inligting
koste-doeltreffend by elke landsburger te kry.
Die wetsontwerp is 'n goeie stuk wetgewing ter bevordering van 'n goeie,
belangrike oogmerk en die Nuwe NP en die DA steun die wetsontwerp.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)
[Mr J SCHIPPERS: Madam Speaker, from the historic recording of the oldest
library of King Shepseskaf in Giza (2575 BC), and the richest and oldest of
that time, namely the court library of King Ashurbanipal (668-627 BC) in
Nineveh, to the present ultramodern libraries in the big centres of the
world, librarianship has grown and developed into a modern science which is
indispensable to every nation and country.
Library and information services must be the instrument through which a
nation can research its history and all facets of that country's existence
by using books, journals, scientific and technical literature, written
documents, acoustic documents such as gramophone records, tape recordings
and films. The Bill currently before the House is important in this regard.
It aims to establish a council which will bring together two important
departments in the process of nation-building and development in the
country, namely the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology and
the Department of Education.
The importance of the Bill lies in the functions of the council, namely
clause 4 of the Bill. Clause 4(1) clearly specifies that the council must,
firstly, inform the Ministers of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology and
of Education on various matters, and, secondly, it must fulfil a co-
ordinating function. It is important that the activities of the two
departments should not be duplicated as regards the functions of the
council. This would be a waste of time, energy and money.
South Africa has a high illiteracy rate and all attempts to improve this
must in fact be lead by the departments concerned. The envisaged council
must be instrumental in this. Co-operation between the information services
of the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology and the
Education Library and Information Services, Edulis, should be a powerful
factor, on the one hand to stimulate and support the socioeconomic,
technological and information development of all communities and, on the
other, to facilitate optimal access to relevant information cost-
effectively for every citizen.
The Bill is a good piece of legislation for the promotion of a good,
important objective and the New NP and the DA support the Bill.]
Miss O N MNDENDE: Madam Speaker, the importance of library and information
services in the greater context of education and literacy cannot be
overemphasised. The UDM, therefore, welcomes this legislation which is an
attempt to address these crucial issues affecting the future of our nation.
The Bill seeks to create a national council that will manage the provision
of library and information services. It is hoped that the people chosen to
serve on the council will cover all aspects of this diverse and complex
field in order to ensure that the needs of all users and practitioners are
adequately addressed.
The UDM is especially concerned about the proper representation of all
provincial and local library and information services, since it is at this
level that the council will have to strive for development and access for
the benefit of all the people of South Africa. We urge the council to
create mechanisms that will enable each and every library and information
service provider to communicate with it, thereby avoiding a situation in
which a council sits somewhere in an air-conditioned building twice a year,
far removed from the reality out there.
The library and information services sector is full of dedicated and often
underpaid and underresourced people who struggle daily to service the
public to the best of their ability. We must empower these people and allow
them to guide the council towards solutions. I repeat: Let us not create an
inaccessible council that enstranges the very people for whom we need to do
crucial groundwork.
President Mbeki has on numerous occasions highlighted the need for South
Africa to enter the information age aggressively. The amount of work this
will entail in a country with such a huge literacy and education backlog is
staggering. The work of the council is thus all the more important and
challenging.

[I hope that everybody will be able to participate in this new legislation
so that children in rural areas do not just have an idea of what a library
is all about. Libraries in rural areas should be well constructed. In that
way we will be able to access information, as we require it.]
The UDM supports this Bill. [Applause.]
Ms C DUDLEY: Oh Jesus Christ, mighty God, I acknowledge. You as Lord of
lords, King of kings and Holy Spirit, and I welcome You here.
Madam Speaker and colleagues, the Constitution states that access to
information is a fundamental right of all South Africans, and the
importance of libraries should not be underestimated. This Bill seeks to
establish a National Council for Library and Information Services and to
provide for matters connected to this. The ACDP will vote in favour of this
Bill. [Interjections.]
With the penetration of information technology into every sector of
society, the impact it has on libraries is especially significant. The
Internet has reduced the importance of conventional libraries, but
libraries still have a highly effective role to play in our society. They
will, however, have to market themselves as a partner of education and
socioeconomic upliftment. Today's libraries will have to invest in
technology that connects people to worldwide opportunities in information
and educational development programmes.
I am aware of current renovations going on in our library at Parliament
that aim at providing a better service for members. It is my guess that
since we have access to the Internet, few MPs make use of the library. It
may be useful for library management and Parliament to create an intranet
service through which the library can feed MPs with relevant information,
such as the latest books and journals available, topics covered, etc.
Libraries are changing all over the world. Although they are still the
primary resource for books, journals and newspapers, they must, in the
contemporary context, be seen as institutions of empowerment and
development. If we invest in libraries as empowerment agencies, the
socioeconomic future of this country will accelerate to the benefit of all.
Ngiyabonga [Thank you]. [Interjections.]
Mr G E BALOI: Madam Speaker, library and information services provide South
Africa with information by means of modern information technology, mainly
to scientific, academic and business groups. However, the same does not
apply to the majority of South Africans.
At present these services are rendered from a point of view of race, class
and urban bias. The various library information services are governed by a
variety of national statutes, provincial ordinances and municipal
regulations.
The establishment of a national council for the library and information
services sector goes back to the days of the apartheid era National
Advisory Council on Libraries and Information which was in operation from
1967 to 1982, and to the days of the National Library Advisory Council
which existed from 1982 to 1986. Reports of the policy development
initiatives and investigations of the early 1990s are also available.
Research done by these organisations highlights the need for a National
Council for Library and Information Services which could co- ordinate the
national strategy within the library and information services system. This
would be in line with the wishes of both the South African library and
information services sector and Unesco. [Interjections.]
I apologise for the ringing of my cellular phone. [Laughter.]
Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, the PAC supports the National Council for
Library and Information Services Bill and congratulates the Minister of
Arts, Culture, Science and Technology.
We agree with the Minister that there is a great need to develop the habit
of reading in this nation, particularly in African languages. It is
imperative to encourage writers in African languages, so that those among
our people who cannot read English may educate themselves through acquiring
knowledge in their own languages.
It is important that our libraries are supplied with books which are
written from an afrocentric point of view, so as to decolonise the minds of
our people and exorcise the demon of an inferiority complex. Knowledge is
power. A nation that does not read, cannot advance. The School of Oriental
and African Studies at the University of London has the kind of library we
should emulate. It has a lot of books from Africa.

(Translation of Tshivenḓa speech follows.)
[Mrs T J TSHIVHASE: Madam Speaker, members of Parliament and this august
House, today I will debate the National Council for Library and Information
Services Bill. I really would like us all to applaud this Bill. This is
because South Africa is one of the developing countries which has a task to
fulfil.
As we are also counted among the democratic states of the world, it is
fitting that everyone should have knowledge and information services. That
will liberate all citizens to have freedom of the mind and pride in our
society. Therefore, I hope we will all participate in strengthening this
Bill.
The previous apartheid government left us with a huge task of making
knowledge available to everyone. Most people, especially those in the rural
areas, had no libraries and centres of information. Today, let us rejoice
because this Bill makes it possible for their establishment. Our people
will have the opportunity to go and get advice to improve their lives in
these places. Students will also have places that are conducive to
learning, making enquiries and getting feedback on their education.
The objectives of this Bill are the following: Firstly, availability of
information services to assist in education, socioeconomics, development,
science and technology. Secondly, the establishment of communication
between people in the rural and urban areas. People will share information
that will build the nation.
Thirdly, to provide for the formation of the council that will advise the
Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, together with the
Minister of Education, on the development of libraries, information
services and other issues. Fourthly, to have procedures that will enable
financial control, the erection of buildings, acquiring equipment and
looking after employees.
Fifthly, to address the unfortunate position of those who were previously
marginalised, especially people in the rural areas. If possible, they
should be given preference. Sixthly, to enable people to read and write so
that they can make use of libraries and information services.
The most important thing in this Bill is to support the Legal Deposit Act,
which was promulgated in July 1998, including The South African Library for
the Blind Act and The National Library of South Africa Act. The Legal
Deposit Act entails the collection of South African historical data for its
archives, thus enabling access to researchers. Electronic publications and
films should also be available.
It is true that the future of our children, our grandchildren and all the
people of South Africa will be greatly improved if members of Parliament in
this Chamber support this Bill. We in the ANC are determined to improve
people's lives in South Africa. Let us all therefore join hands and
participate in this challenging good work. [Applause.]]
Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Deputy Speaker, the primary function of the National
Council for Library and Information Services is to facilitate access to
information by any institution or person that needs it for a certain
purpose. The national council, as an advisory body to the the main role-
players, is tasked with the duty of implementing and maintaining the norms
and standards for the provisions of information services.
In order to achieve equity and consistently evaluate the information
services throughout the world at all levels, it is advised that the
committee or working group meet at least three times a year, instead of
once a year as determined by section 11(5) of the Bill. The duty of the
council is to create a strong leadership that will strategically co-
ordinate libraries and information services, to make the resources
available to the disadvantaged communities.
With the ever-increasing rate of illiteracy, it is important that libraries
become more user-friendly to the general public at large. A new and
improved library and information service can be achieved by constantly
upgrading data through new and improved technology, and access to computers
and Internet services.
The MF strongly recommends that the service providers begin working from
the grass-roots level during the implementation of the Bill, thus creating
awareness at all levels. The MF supports the National Council for Library
and Information Services Bill. [Time expired.]
Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, die erkenning wat by implikasie in
hierdie wetgewing aan die rol van biblioteke in die ontwikkeling van
gemeenskappe gegee word, moet verwelkom word.
Dit is dwarsoor die wêreld goed bekend dat waar gemeenskappe self 'n
aktiewe rol speel in hulle eie ontwikkeling, en nie passief alle steun van
die sentrale owerheid verwag nie, biblioteke en inrigtings op die plaaslike
vlak 'n sleutelrol vervul. Deur die verskaffing van inligting dra hulle by
tot die inspirasie, maar ook tot die daadwerklike ondersteuning van
ontwikkeling in die gemeenskap.
Daarby glo ek dat biblioteke en bibliotekaresses 'n spesiale
verantwoordelikheid het om by te dra tot die beskerming van intellektuele
vryheid in 'n wêreld waarin daar al hoe meer gevaartekens is van 'n
terugkeer na sensuur en onverdraagsaamheid.
Die klem moet val, soos die wetgewing dit wil hê, op
inligtingsgeletterdheid. In 'n era waar die klem toenemend en tereg op
voortgesette en lewenslange onderwys en opleiding val, raak dit al hoe
belangriker om krities en kreatief met inligting om te gaan. Daar bestaan
'n illusie dat die oorvloed inligting wat op die Internet beskikbaar is die
oplossing vir alle probleme inhou. Ek wil betoog dat opleiding oor die
beoordeling van inligtingsbronne al hoe noodsaakliker raak, anders dink 'n
mens naderhand MIV veroorsaak nie vigs nie!
Saam met die positiewe wil ek egter ook 'n beroep doen dat nie toegelaat
word dat hierdie raad bloot 'n instelling word wat mooi ondersoeke aanpak
en welluidende verslae op lêer laat beland nie. Ek vertrou dat die mooi
woorde van die Minister ook beslag sal kry in 'n behoorlike en verhoogde
begrotingsvoorsiening vir biblioteke op die provinsiale en veral die
plaaslike vlak.
Dit is daar in ons plaaslike gemeenskappe onder alle taal- en kultuurgroepe
waar die uitwerking van hierdie wetsontwerp se goeie bedoelings uiteindelik
getoets gaan word. As dit ook die gesindheid en die bedoeling van die
Minister is, steun die AEB graag hierdie wetsontwerp. (Translation of
Afrikaans speech follows.)
[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, the recognition of the role of libraries in
the development of communities which is implied in this legislation, must
be welcomed.
Throughout the world it is well known that where communities themselves
play an active role in their own development and do not passively expect
total support from the central authority, libraries and institutions play a
key role at the local level. By providing information they contribute to
the inspiration, as well as the active support of development in the
community.
In addition, I believe that libraries and librarians have a special
responsibility to contribute to the protection of intellectual freedom in a
world in which there are more and more danger signs of a return to
censorship and intolerance.
The emphasis must be, as the legislation would have it, on information
literacy. In an era in which the emphasis is being placed more and more,
and rightly so, on continuous and lifelong education and training, it is
becoming increasingly important to work with information in a critical and
creative manner. The illusion exists that the abundance of information
available on the Internet is the solution to all problems. I submit that
training with regard to the evaluation of sources of information is
becoming more and more essential, otherwise one eventually starts to think
that Aids is not caused by HIV!
Together with the positive, I also want to request that this council not be
allowed to become an institution which merely undertakes fine
investigations and puts fine-sounding reports on file. I trust that the
fine words of the Minister will also manifest themselves in a proper and
increased budget provision for libraries at the provincial and especially
at the local level.
It is in our local communities, amongst all linguistic and cultural groups,
that the effect of the good intentions of this Bill will ultimately be
tested. If this is also the view and the intention of the Minister, then
the AEB will gladly support this Bill.]
Mr S L DITHEBE: Madam Speaker, hon members, I have heckled so many times
since I came here that mine can hardly be called a maiden speech.
Mahatma Gandhi once said, ``Knowledge is power,'' and we all know that that
knowledge is deeply imbedded in the books that are found in our libraries.
The logic for the existence of libraries is to provide information for
research and development at primary, secondary, tertiary and community
levels. Without this service, the social, economic, political and
psychological development of society would be grossly stunted. It is for
this reason that we welcome the introduction in the House to this Bill,
which will revolutionise the library and information services regime in our
country and beyond.
I say ``beyond'', because in the words of our President: ``A better Africa
and a better world are in the genuine interest of South Africa's people. ''
However, this vision will be stillborn if we do not ensure co-ordination,
collaboration and integration between services provided by academic,
school, special and legislature libraries to ensure mobilisation and access
to a reservoir of resources provided by these institutions collectively.
We further salute the announcement by the President during his state of the
nation address on 9 February to this House that in order to ensure that we
do not fall behind the rest of the world, as a result of the digital
divide, a Presidential National Commission on Information Society and
Development, as well as a Presidential International Task Force on
Information Society and Development will be established.
This announcement comes at a time when universities, traditional healers,
leaders, and local and indigenous communities are grappling with the
challenges of indigenous knowledge systems in order to spearhead the
African Renaissance. Courses have also been developed in this regard and
sites established in order to pursue further research. It is in pursuit of
projects such as this that we will succeed in restoring confidence in
Africans. We must pursue this and other projects through the information
revolution in order to give meaning to the words of our President, and I
quote:
...that no African child should ever again experience hunger, avoidable
disease and ignorance; that no African child should ever again feel ashamed
to be an African.
While there is a need to argue from a librarian's viewpoint, the lines
between information-related professions have become increasingly blurred. I
would like to echo the views of Benjamin's unpublished recommendations to
the European Council on 26 May 1994, titled: Europe and the Global
Information Society:
Technological progress can now enable us to process, store, retrieve and
communicate information in whatever form it may take, unconstrained by
distance, time and volume. This revolution adds huge new capacities to
human intelligence and constitutes a resource which changes the way we work
together and the way we live together.
It was 45 years ago that the people of our country came together to draft
the Freedom Charter, and one of the clauses contained in that document
which they authored is about opening the doors of learning and culture.
That clause, ``The doors of learning and culture shall be opened'', says
that there shall be a free exchange of ideas and contact with other
countries. This mission is impossible if we do not make use of bodies such
as the council that will be established in terms of the Bill that is
serving before us today, in order to ensure that that dream does not become
a pipe dream, that the dreams, hopes and aspirations of our people are not
betrayed.

[Ditlatse.] (Translation of Sesotho paragraphs follows.)
[From now on, let all library services be accessible to the public, beyond
all the newly demarcated municipal boundaries, and also serve to encourage
our children to read in their mother tongues, instead of reading Harry
Potter and so forth. These services must be accessible to everybody,
regardless of their level of education or their age.
Libraries are places of great significance from which people may acquire
information so that they may be knowledgeable about events that are taking
place throughout the country. We have noticed that when people lack
information, they are disempowered and are unable to take decisions that
can improve the quality of their lives.
I would like to emphasise these words by citing the example of a person who
enters a prohibited area due to the fact that he or she cannot read the
warning signs. He or she is likely to be injured. This means, in other
words, that when our people are afforded the opportunity to learn so that
they can read, they will be able to take decisions that affect their lives
and avoid dangerous situations. [Applause.]]
The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Madam Speaker,
colleagues, comrades and members of our Parliament, I would like to thank
all of you for being so conscious of this national imperative to promote
the dissemination of and access to knowledge and information for all our
people.
What we have agreed upon is a Bill that helps to create one of most
important social and economic infrastructures of this country, the library
information services system. Thank you very much for the zeal and the
common vision that you have demonstrated. Let this mark a new beginning for
all of us, for all the parties, that on those issues that are absolutely
fundamental for progress, development and job creation in this country,
there is unanimity and a common purpose.
I would also like to thank our international partners who have on many
occasions provided books to our schools and to our community libraries, but
more than anybody else I would like to thank the Carnegie Foundation, which
is providing assistance to three provinces and three metrocities. Each one
of those provinces and metrocities will get about R7 million to help
develop a library information service. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.
Bill read a second time.
                          THE SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE
                          (Subject for Discussion)
The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, almost exactly a year ago, I
went to Harare with some of my colleagues shortly after the constitutional
referendum there, which President Mugabe lost. At that time he seemed to
accept the decision of his voters with equanimity and dignity.
I returned from Harare again this afternoon and it is difficult to describe
how the situation has changed. Unfortunately, very much for the worse since
then. High hope has given way to despair and optimism has been replaced by
a deep and pervasive fear on the streets. What we have in that country now
is a culture of impunity, leading to the shedding of any pretence of
democratic legitimacy by the President of Zimbabwe as he cracks down on the
three vital checks and balances on this or any other democracy - the press,
the courts and the political opposition.
The situation, I believe, is so extreme that it is difficult to capture in
a single sentence, an anecdote or fact on how exactly it is. Some people
know exactly how bad it is. But perhaps there are a few items that we
should consider. The state of institutionalised lawlessness and terror is
undoubtedly and regrettably directed there by the head of state and
supported by his army and police. That is why the Minister of Justice,
completely contrary to his own constitution, could say to a Supreme Court
Judge, as he urged him to resign the other day: ``The President hopes you
do not get hurt''.
That is why also, the Zanu-PF MP Dr Hitler Hunzvi, was captured on a tape
by our own SABC and Radio Sonder Grense having described the members of the
judiciary in Zimbabwe as ``devils who must go and I will make sure that
they do go''. That is probably why not a single person has been charged,
convicted or sentenced for the murder of the 41 opposition party supporters
during the election campaign and more recently in the January 2001 Bekitso
West by-election campaign.
In addition to, or perhaps because of the aforegoing, one faces a situation
where this culture of impunity is matched by an economic meltdown on a
scale that is almost unimaginable - it certainly is for us, from where we
sit. There is 60% unemployment, 55% inflation, -10% growth forecast, a
million jobs lost in the last 18 months, half of them on the farms, and a
false interest rate kept down at 15%, even though, apparently, the real
interest rate is closer to 60%. So one has a campaign of terror on the one
hand matched by economic bankruptcy and meltdown on the other.
But I suppose the real enquiry relevant to our proceedings and debate today
is what we should be doing about it, if anything. The first question that I
would like to ask the gentleman over there is: What is our policy on
Zimbabwe at the moment? Apparently - and it has never really been
explicitly spelt out - we have pursued a policy of quiet diplomacy or
comradely persuasion. As recently as seven days ago, our Foreign Minister,
Dr Dlamini-Zuma, said, and I quote:
We will not go to war and we will encourage good neighbourliness.
Now, that presents that there really are only two choices: either one goes
to war or wages a full-scale invasion - which is clearly preposterous and
out of the question - or one has good neighbourliness. There is no range of
options between those two.
However, actually far worse than that was the view of the Chairperson of
the SADC Ministers Council, speaking on behalf of all SADC countries only
last week in Midrand, when he said that there was no question of human
rights abuses in Zimbabwe. Their position was that it was an internal
matter, SADC had no intention of interfering in Zimbabwe's affairs, and
that there was no crisis. The late John Vorster could not have put it
better. But as a matter of principle and fact, that statement is
fundamentally wrong.
My colleague Mr Eglin would explain precisely how Article 4 of the
declaration of SADC in Windhoek in 1992 commits member states of SADC to
uphold principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. It also
provides for sanctions to be imposed against member states who violate
those principles. But I think the far more fundamental point is the
question of rights violations which gives rise to a statement like that.
I was given a copy of a document last night prepared by an independent and
international Danish Research Council for Torture Victims, which chronicled
not the excesses which our own MPs presumably picked up during the election
campaign last June, but the most recent batch only last month in the
Bekitso West by-election.
I will just read three paragraphs to hon members:
Representatives of an international development and human rights
organisation examined nine persons who had participated in lawful
campaigning during a by-election in Bikita in January 2001.
All nine persons reported that they had been beaten, some that they had
been ill-treated in other ways by the Zanu-PF, war veterans and/or the
police. In all nine cases there was agreement between the history of ill-
treatment, the ensuing symptoms and the result of the clinical examination,
ie all nine testimonies were, on medical grounds, found to be valid. Six of
the interviewed men reported that they identified MP Dr Hunzvi among the
aggressors.
The fact that many persons who support a legal election campaign on those
grounds were arrested and beaten in the same manner by three groups - the
police, Zanu-PF and the war veterans - must be seen as an indication of a
pattern of organised violence involving the security forces, the political
party in power and its supporters. The fact that an MP participated
systematically and overtly further stresses the political responsibility
and indicates an unfortunate confusion and abuse of legislative and
executive power. The findings fit the description of the present human
rights crisis in Zimbabwe given by all other organisations.
The larger question is: Why should South Africa still act and are any of
our actions effective? Apparently, quiet diplomacy has failed - I think
that is the implicit acknowledgement President Mbeki made only on Monday.
The question is: Do we need to try something new? What I understand, and
which was explained by Minister Erwin in this Parliament, is that what we
have to do is provide a policy, framework or assistance to ensure that
things in Zimbabwe do not fall apart.
However, the truth - and I obviously agree with that - is that the
situation in Zimbabwe is so far gone and appears to be deteriorating, and
actually shows no sign of improvement. It was put to me last night by
people who are very responsible, decent and democratic that there is a
dirty war in Zimbabwe. [Interjections.] Well, members of the ANC met some
of them early yesterday. There is an unfolding horror story in Zimbabwe,
because when one realises that violence wins and goes unpunished, and one
needs to stay in power, what one needs to do is unleash further instalments
of the same violence. And if our desire, as is now accepted, is to actually
save the situation from deteriorating further, we are simply going to take
those facts and ask how it is going to be in the next eighteen months
leading up to the presidential election.
It has been suggested - and I see that the Minister for Agriculture and
Land Affairs is going to speak in this debate - that actually the real
issue in Zimbabwe is not about these silly things, such as human rights,
democracy and elections, but all about land and redressing colonialism. The
characterisation of the meltdown in Zimbabwe as being about land and land
hunger is, with respect, simply not true. Every party that I have spoken to
in Harare and here, including the CFU, acknowledges and is willing to
implement land reform. But the reality, it seems, is reflected in the words
of the Archbishop of Bulawayo, Pius Ncube, who said, and I quote:
The land reform exercise is a cloak for a campaign against the opposition.
There are much more blunt descriptions of that. The Economist calls Mr
Mugabe "Africa's own Mussolini". This morning the Sowetan demanded from Mr
Mugabe that he honour his promises and urged our President to use the
economic and political leverage at his disposal to see that it happens. But
what has happened is that our President has met the Zimbabwean President at
least four times - by my calculation it might be more - since that ill-
fated summit in Victoria Falls on Easter Friday last April.
It appears, although we have never been explicitly told, because quiet
diplomacy operates behind cupped hands and closed doors, that promise after
promise and commitment after commitment by Mr Mugabe have been honoured
only in their breach. Indeed, the last meeting between the two presidents
happened in December in Harare and was precisely about the issue of land,
and a specific package was put on the table by the UNDP which required
three conditions to be met. One, that the process of land reform and
distribution be transparent; two, that it be done on a basis that it will
restore the rule of law; and three, that the principles of equity be
applied, in other words, that it does not favour one group over another.
None of those conditions has ever been responded to. So, if the issue is,
in fact, about land and there is a land reform programme on the table, as
well as donor funds available, the onus is on the Zimbabwean government.
However, to go back to what was said about our options: There is an entire
menu of diplomatic and political measures, options with which, I believe,
we should confront the Zimbabwean government in the event of their
noncompliance with their own commitment to human rights and their own
regional agreements to the rule of law and the restoration and
acknowledgement of democracy.
Currently, the UN provides for the freezing of foreign assets and funds
owned by individuals and Ministers; one can have restrictions of travel by
government Ministers; one can have an arms embargo, such as that which
Britain has introduced; and one can have a curtailment of diplomatic
personnel abroad. There is a whole menu of options that are available to us
and our Government, instead of just simply quietly going along in order to
get along. [Interjections.]
However, I would say, fundamentally, something far more important is that
we ourselves, as MPs from all parties, actually go to Zimbabwe, see for
ourselves, make a determination, join the Commonwealth fact- finding group
and actually see what the reality on the ground is now, not what it was
last June. We should see if the situation will get worse, because I regret
to say it will, and at all times act with honour, act on principle. We
should not pretend that evil or wrongdoing can be appeased or that it can
be ignored, because it cannot. [Applause.]
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, in our statement of 8
January the ANC said, and I quote:
   Slavery, colonialism and neocolonialism have ravaged the African economy.
   The provision of an adequate standard of living for the millions of our
   people has been very weak.
The situation has to be corrected by rebuilding Africa's economies to
ensure that they are able to generate the necessary volumes of wealth, work
for the people and the capacities that will ensure that we take our
rightful place within the global economy.
This ANC-policy statement as well as what the President said in this House
about us uniting for change in the fight against poverty, are what must
guide us in this debate today. Our position on the challenges faced by the
people of Zimbabwe must follow this approach. We cannot do anything that is
going to defeat this perspective and lead to the polarisation of the people
of our region. Instead, we should be doing everything to build unity
amongst the people of Zimbabwe ... [Interjections] ... so that they can
address the problem they face together, irrespective of political
affiliation.
The ties that bind us with Zimbabwe are many, but we have much common
history. Our paths are very different. We must look at the distinctions as
well as the parallels in order to work for solutions that will benefit our
countries and our region.
Zimbabwe is facing great challenges. Perhaps the root of the problem is
that, after an initial period of growth after independence, structural
adjustment requirements have led to negative growth and, most critically,
it is seeking a solution to the question of land reform and redistribution.
Today too much remains in the hands of too few. The economic decline has
compounded the frustrations of the war veterans, the youth and the landless
peasants. Some people have taken the law into their own hands.
Contrast this with the situation in South Africa. Our post-democracy period
is characterised by fiscal responsibility, growth and transformation,
though we still face many challenges. With a fundamentally sound economy we
are now moving into an economic environment with emphasis on the
microeconomy to stimulate growth and development. Our strength is that we
arrived at freedom after a long struggle through negotiation and agreement.

Sadly, the problems of Zimbabwe have been used to stir up insecurity in
this country. Questions of press freedom, of the relationship between
government and the judiciary and the breakdown of the rule of law have been
dangled in front of the people of this country as though these were under
threat here, in the new South Africa.
The ANC does not waver on these issues. The ANC has built the freedom of
expression, the freedom of opinion and belief into our Constitution. Yet,
the ANC will continue to debate issues and say so when we disagree with the
media. The independence of the judiciary is an important pillar of any
healthy democratic system. The ANC will fight to keep it so, but will
criticise judgments when we think it necessary to do so, and transform the
judiciary in line with our constitutional values. The ANC will fight to
maintain the rule of law, but will continue to transform the legal
framework of our country in accordance with our beliefs in fairness,
justice and equity.
The values of the ANC do not change for political expedience. Today, in the
old Assembly, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands said, and I quote:
South Africa is an important force of stability and economic development in
the sub-continent.
It is clear that the international community applauds our Government's
policies in relation to our continent, unlike some of the doom and gloom
parties in this House. We must apply the same standards and values
throughout the world. As we raise concerns about Zimbabwe, we must also
raise human rights abuses all over the world, including in Israel.
[Applause.]
We must speak out against the abuse of power we see in the bombing of Iraq.
History is littered with the devastation caused by foreign powers
interfering in the internal affairs of foreign states. Vietnam is only one
example. We must not be politically expedient. We must be politically
consistent and condemn human rights abuses wherever and whenever they take
place. [Applause.]
The issue of land must be resolved within the broad context of development,
democracy and human rights, as envisaged in the Millennium Africa
Renaissance Programme, MARP. Key to the solution of the problems faced by
Zimbabwe is the speedy resolution of the land question. It is the
responsibility of South Africa and the entire international community to
commit themselves to solving this land problem and ensuring a fair
distribution of land to the rural masses.
Calls for sanctions, Mr Tony Leon, and for cutting off aid, is
irresponsible. Such action will only result in more hungry stomachs
streaming across our borders. In this House, on 20 September 2000, our
President said, referring to the situation in Zimbabwe, and I quote:
We can shout as much as we want, but this will not address this issue. We
are not governors or the government of Zimbabwe ... that this is handled in
a manner that respects the law, that respects the rights of Zimbabweans and
that produces the stability and development that is required.
Zimbabwe is a democracy with a democratically elected government. We cannot
only believe in the ballot box when it suits us. Let us leave the internal
politics of our neighbours to the people of those countries, but always
insist on and reaffirm our commitment to justice, freedom of expression and
a rule of law.
The ANC has historic links with Zanu-PF. We fought the same liberation
struggle against colonialism and racism, but we speak to all parties in
Zimbabwe, including the opposition parties like the MDC. In the last
elections the opposition made a very strong showing. These oppositions in
Zimbabwe must use its support responsibly and work to bring about growth,
stability, democracy and peace.
Yesterday, I met with the leadership of the MDC, Mr Morgan Tsvangirai and
Gibson Sibanda, the leader of the opposition in the Zimbabwean parliament.
Mr Tsvangirai told the media after our meeting that that meeting with the
ANC had been one of the most important he had held. [Applause.]
We had a frank discussion about the situation in Zimbabwe and we agreed
that a lasting solution to the challenges and problems faced by the people
of Zimbabwe had to come from the people of Zimbabwe themselves. But this
was not the first meeting, I must say. The MDC has met the ANC before. Our
secretary-general, Comrade Kgalema Mothlanthe, led an ANC delegation to
Zimbabwe last year that met with both the Zanu-PF and the MDC. We are
meeting all these groups in order to contribute positively towards ensuring
that democracy and economic stability thrive in Zimbabwe.
Our President has said that he will meet President Robert Mugabe and engage
him on the challenges faced by his country. This is a bold political
statement by our own head of state. Our Government will not hesitate to
engage, but will not attempt to impose its will through irresponsible
actions.
Instead of making cheap politics out of the problems of our neighbours,
whilst following the core values of the ANC and our Constitution, let us
all devote our energy to building unity in action for change. [Applause.]
Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Chairperson, hon members, just a few years after
independence an African leader was asked the question: ``Why are you
mismanaging your country?'' The African leader answered: ``Yes, at least we
are mismanaging it ourselves.'' [Laughter.] This can only be the response
of a man with a strong sense of past injustice, a man who is determined to
guard and protect, even to the point of self- destruction, the hard-won
territorial integrity with a back-off attitude. This is what may be
happening in Zimbabwe.
On the other hand, there are those who would like to approach the Zimbabwe
question with a defeatist attitude of: Oh, but what good can come from
Africa? For these people the debate about the Zimbabwe situation is not
necessarily prompted by any good for that country, but by the fear that the
same things that are happening in Zimbabwe could happen in South Africa.
Those approaches to the Zimbabwe question, I am afraid, are wrong.
The main problem in Zimbabwe is the occupation of privately-owned farms,
where these occupations have ostensibly been assisted by the government of
Zimbabwe. These occupations can be explained both historically and
politically.
At independence the government of Zimbabwe inherited a racially-skewed
agricultural and land structure. The large-scale commercial farming sector,
made up of about 6 000 white farmers, owned about 45% of agricultural land.
The small-scale commercial farming sector, comprising 8 500 black farmers,
held only 5% of the agricultural land, mostly in the drier agro-ecological
areas. These land imbalances reflect a colonial legacy of racial and class
monopoly, which in turn required, and still requires, some corrective
policies so as to bring about an equitable distribution of land.
But, apparently there has been some frustration on the part of the
Zimbabwean government with the land reform process. This frustration can be
traced back partly to the Lancaster House agreements at independence. The
donor funds for land resettlements which were promised to Zimbabwe by the
major donor countries, including Britain, never materialised or they came
too late, too little.
Another source of President Mugabe's frustration has been the political
developments there, which saw the formation and growth of the opposition
that coincidentally was and still is supported by commercial farmers,
amongst others.
The second main problem is that the government no longer seems to respect
the rule of law, and court judgments have been ignored and members of the
judiciary have been threatened, so much so that higher ranking judges have
resigned.
There are other problems, such as the suppression of the private press, and
the political opposition. The actions of the Zimbabwean government have no
doubt affected the economy of that country. The production of tobacco has
been adversely affected due to land occupations. Foreign donor aid has all
but dried up. Assistance by foreign governments and international bodies
such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank has also been
cut substantially.
However, the gist of the debate is about the best approach to what is
happening in Zimbabwe. If the situation in Zimbabwe is as volatile as it is
purported to be, and its president has lost all political sanity, as he is
being portrayed to have, it surely would not be politically prudent for the
South African Government to be a red rag to a bull in dealing with
President Mugabe. I do not believe that shouting: ``Down with President
Mugabe'' would have helped anything at all.
Ngesizulu sivamise ukuthi: ``Akusizi lutho ukuthela inkomo ngezibonkolo
ngoba iyoba nolaka kakhulu, mhlawumbe ihlabe kakhulu ize ilimaze nawe uqobo
lwakho.'' [Ubuwelewele.] (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)
Usually in Zulu we say: ``It does not help at all to pour stinging black
ants over a bull because it becomes more aggressive, so much so that it
might even gore its master.'' [Interjections.]
I would, of course, understand if this shouting of: ``Down with President
Mugabe,'' was done by the Zimbabweans themselves. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]
Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Mr Chairperson, on 23 May 2000, the ANC, in the
name of the hon member Dr Pallo Jordan, proposed a brave motion here in
Parliament. Dr Jordan proposed that this House condemn the brutality,
thuggery and loss of human life in Zimbabwe. Unfortunately that proposal
was withdrawn, under pressure, shortly thereafter.
Since then, we have seen the price that the people of Zimbabwe have had to
pay for President Mbeki's and the South African Government's policy of
silent diplomacy. There are reported to have been at least 5 000 death and
assault threats, 635 political abductions, 2 700 political assaults, 45
political murders, and much more. Foreign direct investment in South Africa
plummeted by 43%.
We have seen one defence after the other being offered by this President
and members of his Cabinet for what is, clearly, an indefensible policy.
The motivation for silent diplomacy was best summarised by an ANC MEC who
said in a debate last month:
ZANU-PF are our traditional friends and we will never forsake them.
This was followed by loud applause from the ANC benches. The ANC MEC went
on to say:
We will never forsake our traditional friends with whom we fought side by
side ...
In other words, the ANC will support their old political friends,
regardless of the human rights abuses, regardless of the damage to our
region, and regardless of the damage to our own country, our own economy
and our own people. The time has come for us to put the interests of our
country and all our people first.
The question that must be asked is the following: Is the South African
Government's policy a policy of silent diplomacy, or that of quiet
approval? The main dimension of the Zimbabwean crisis is not a black and
white issue, as some in the ANC would like us to believe. Many black
leaders and commentators are highly critical of the Zimbabwean situation
and our Government's handling of it.
During the height of the Zimbabwean crisis, Mr Mandela said: ``The public
must bring these tyrants down themselves.'' The editor of the Zimbabwe
Independent and the Standard, Mr Trevor Ncube, said in a recent interview
that the South African President ``... is being hoodwinked by his
Zimbabwean counterpart and his ruling ZANU-PF party.''
The ANC must know that they are on the wrong side of history with regard to
the Zimbabwean issue. [Interjections.] Much of what the ANC professes to
stand for and what they fought for has been undermined by their Zimbabwean
policy thus far. [Interjections.]
However, a small crack appeared over the weekend in the ANC's stubborn
attitude up to now. After meeting with our International Investment Council
over the weekend, President Mbeki is quoted in news reports as having said,
with regard to the Zimbabwe issue:
Apart from anything else, it impacts negatively on this country.
An independent researcher of the S A Institute of International Affairs, Mr
Moeletsi Mbeki - who happens to be the President's brother - told the
SABC's Newsmaker programme on Sunday that Zimbabwe is a burden to South
Africa. He went on to say:
South Africa should take a tough stance on Zimbabwe by making sure that it
supports the opposition parties. All the neighbouring countries, including
South Africa, should force Zimbabwe to follow democratic processes.
[Interjections.] The time for the ANC to show moral courage and to reverse
their policy is now. It is not a shame for any government to change its
policy. This Government has over the last few months reversed its policies
on other issues. Instead of appearing weak and being criticised, they
received recognition for this. The latest edition of the influential The
Economist said that most of the components of an African version of fascism
are now in place in Zimbabwe. The only option for the ANC is to get on the
right side of history and reverse its policy. It should do that now.
In conclusion, the impression is that silent diplomacy was and is indeed
quiet approval. Public pressure, now, is what will restore this President
and Government's credibility. [Applause.]
Mr B H HOLOMISA: Chairperson, Deputy President and hon members, the issue
of Zimbabwe places us between two conflicting concepts of modern
international politics. On the one hand, there is the concept of
sovereignty and on the other there is the concept of regional interests
such as co-operation and stability.
On a humanitarian level, the suffering of the Zimbabwean people and the
massive exodus of citizens from that country to neighbouring countries is a
serious matter that places a heavy burden on neighbouring countries. It is
this general suffering of ordinary citizens, black and white alike, that is
of great concern rather than the special interests of a small class that
must command our response.
If, as we all seem to agree, regional interests outweigh the concept of
sovereignty, we must bear in mind a number of factors. Firstly, since it is
an issue of regional concern the region as a whole, and not just South
Africa on its own, must seek a solution for Zimbabwe precisely because of
the role it plays in SADC. It is time for SADC to show the resolve and
moral courage to deal with the crisis that threatens to topple one of its
key members and to destabilise the whole region.
Secondly, we cannot ignore a country's sovereignty completely even under
the banner of SADC, as the South African Government did in its overzealous
invasion of Lesotho. Zimbabwe is threatening the region's stability and
economy. The region, through SADC, must now act concertedly to address the
problems. Our actions, whether in the interest of sovereignty or regional
stability, must always pass the simple humanitarian test.
President Mbeki is selling his Millennium African Recovery Programme to the
world on the basic tenet that the abuse of power will no longer be
tolerated in Africa. We applaud such a principle. Now we urge the President
to practise it and demonstrate that Africa can deal with its own problems
even-handedly and decisively. A proper starting place is one's own
backyard. The Government must address the problem of no-go areas in our
society. Such a step will earn us respect and credibility when we raise our
concerns about human rights, corruption, and law and order in other
countries. [Applause.]
Rev K R J MESHOE: Mr Chairman, remarks by President Robert Mugabe at the
weekend that he will not allow the MDC to come to power and a warning by
Vice President Robert Msiga of the second revolution if the MDC wins the
elections, must be strongly condemned by all, particularly Africans.
The days of life-long presidents are over and all African presidents must,
in no uncertain terms, be told that. Dictators have destroyed Africa's
peace, economy and infrastructure. In this age of democracy, knowledge and
information, citizens must have the right to choose their leaders,
protected and promoted by all democratic countries. Bullies, oppressors,
tyrants and failures must be democratically removed at the ballot box and
they must be forced to accept the results of free and fair elections.
Zimbabwe's judiciary must be allowed to perform their duties without
pressure and harassment by the government. It is a disgrace for a Minister
in government to say government cannot guarantee the safety of the
judiciary after ruling party militants had threatened violence against
them. Where is the rule of law?
It is the responsibility of government to ensure the safety of all it
citizens, including members of the judiciary, minority parties and the
media. Zimbabwean security forces must be told to stop their crackdown on
the political opponents of the government. They must allow peaceful
demonstration by community members who are protesting against
victimisation, intimidation and the recent bombing of the independent Daily
News printing press.
To say that SADC might intervene in Zimbabwe if the situation could become
violent, as stated by the Chairman of the SADC Council of Ministers,
baffles me, because the situation in Zimbabwe is already violent and
innocent people have lost their lives as a result. Besides that, prevention
is better than cure.
We call on our President to prioritise his meeting with President Mugabe in
order to try and bring Mr Mugabe to his senses. He must be told to stop
harassing his own people and asked to restore the rule of law in his
country.
Ms S C VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson and hon members, I would like to make two
points in my contribution to this debate. The first one is that Zimbabwe is
a sovereign state. Its parliament and its president have been elected by
the Zimbabwean people, but we are joined as neighbours and fellow Africans,
and the resolution to Zimbabwe's problems is integral to our own future as
a successful nation on this continent.
Secondly, and related to this, I would like to address the issue of
negative perceptions that harm the southern African region as a result of
the problems in Zimbabwe. The multiparty South African observer mission
that travelled to Zimbabwe for that country's parliamentary election in
June last year produced a consensus report which recorded its findings and
concluded that the will of the Zimbabwean people had been fairly expressed
in the elections.
Observing the election was not an easy assignment, because there existed a
deep tension amongst the Zimbabwean people. It was a tension that had been
growing over the previous years and that was due, partly, to a lack of
progress in land reform. It was exacerbated by a steady decline in
socioeconomic conditions in the country.
As observers our task was not to engage in party-political conflicts, but
rather to observe the campaigns and processes that led to a massively
peaceful election period. The role the observer mission played during that
time was, I believe, a constructive one. We were often stopped in the
streets during our many interactions by ordinary Zimbabweans who thanked us
for our presence there as observers. People thanked us because they said
our presence had had a positive influence on what was a violent and
conflict-ridden pre-election period, and had resulted in a calm and
peaceful election period.
Also during our meetings with various groups from government and civil
society, we met with the commercial farmers' union of Zimbabwe. They
indicated to us how much they supported South Africa's role in dealing with
the problem. [Interjections.] The positive and constructive influence that
ours and other observer missions had on the election is important and
should give us an indication of how we should proceed as close neighbours
to a troubled Zimbabwe.
So, what is and what should be South Africa's role in Zimbabwe this time?
The point that the ANC has been making in and outside Government on a wide
range of fronts is to realise a sustainable solution to the problems of
Africa. We need to work together. The ANC cares about what happens in
Zimbabwe, unlike the hon Van Schalkwyk's party that, by their own
admission, is not really interested in Zimbabwe, but has some misguided
fear about South Africa.
The President's Millennium African Recovery Programme, the work of former
President Mandela in Rwanda and Burundi and the role that South Africa
plays in SADC and on the domestic front, building unity amongst our people
and common purpose in resolving our problems, are all initiatives geared
towards the long-term resolution of conflicts on the continent, its
development and the attainment of peace and prosperity for all its people.
Zimbabwe and South Africa are linked by common borders and by historic
links between people. There are many ancient links and common strands
between our two countries: The origins of our languages, the familial ties
between peoples, the bonds of solidarity in our fight against apartheid.
These links impose upon us responsibilities in facilitating a solution to
its problems.
The President has said repeatedly in reply to questions in this House that
these problems have to be addressed in the context of the Zimbabwean
constitution and the law. The result that is sought is sustainable
stability and development of Zimbabwe and for the region. We can only do
this through our engagement with the Zimbabwean people and the government
through our own diplomatic efforts and through our joint efforts with SADC
and the international community.
The second point is the negative perceptions in respect of the Southern
African region of international investors. There is a key principle that
guides our responsibility in this regard, while opposition parties were
baying for South Africa to stand up against the Zimbabwean government,
although they provide no plan or programme as to how to do this. Greta
Steyn wrote in Business Day:
It is difficult to see how the alienation of Zimbabwe can work in South
Africa's favour to draw in investment. Who wants to invest in a strong
country with no markets beyond its borders - an island in a war-ravaged and
poverty-stricken continent? Only the speculators looking to flit in and out
of the country bringing illusionary benefits.
There lies one of the strongest arguments for our country to continue to
play a constructive role in facilitating a resolution to Zimbabwe's
problems and indeed the resolution of other conflicts on the African
continent. Senior businesspeople in South Africa have been quoted as being
quietly supportive of Government too in its policy towards Zimbabwe. One of
them was quoted as saying: What could our President do? He could remain
engaged with Zimbabwe so that there were South African experts talking to
their counterparts in Zimbabwe, trying to sort this out from inside, or he
could send in the tanks to blockade our borders with Zimbabwe.
There is only one sensible response to this question. While the rest of the
world wrings its hands, we continue to work on a solution. The further
decline in socioeconomic conditions will hurt ordinary Zimbabweans most and
will only spell hardship for South Africa and other Southern African
countries. We have got one option, namely to remain engaged, to defend the
principles set out in our Constitution and the freedoms of our Bill of
Rights, to maintain our commitment to the rule of law, to remain committed
to our SADC partners, and above all, to work tirelessly towards the
achievement of a sustainable solution towards stability and prosperity in
our region. Our President and our Government are doing just that.
[Applause.]
Genl C L VILJOEN: Mnr die Voorsitter, al kyk 'n mens ook na Zimbabwe vanuit
enige hoek, oor die huidige situasie is daar niks goeds te sê nie.
Eerstens, gesien vanuit die hoek van Afrika - ons kontinent, daardie
kontinent wat smag na groei en stabiliteit - moet Zimbabwe se minagting van
die regbank, sy skaamtelose intimidasie van die opposisie, die skending van
menseregte, en die minagting van die rol van die media as 'n skande vir
Afrika beskryf word.
Tweedens, vir Zimbabwe se deelname en aanhitsing in die DRK-gevegte, die
skep en die aanhitsing van 'n situasie van onstabiliteit in daardie gebied,
met die gepaardgaande sinlose lewensverlies, is daar net een woord en dit
is dat die land 'n gevaar is vir Afrika.
Derdens, Zimbabwe stroop Afrika van enige beleggersvertroue en Zimbabwe
stroop Afrika van die hoop waarop ons almal gehoop het. Daarvoor is daar
net een woord, en dit is die verarming van Afrika.
Vanuit die oogpunt van Suid-Afrika, is Zimbabwe 'n klap in die gesig van
President Mbeki, wat op 'n eg Afrika-diplomatieke wyse probeer het om vir
lank - miskien te lank - 'n situasie van stille diplomasie toe te pas.
Zimbabwe is 'n bedreiging vir ons en die onstabiele situasie binne daardie
land sal oorwaai na ons land toe. Zimbabwe het 'n groot negatiewe
ekonomiese impak op Suid-Afrika. Dit is sleg vir sakebedrywighede tussen
die twee lande. Dit is ook sleg vir die konsolidasie van die demokrasie van
die streek.
Vanuit die oogpunt van Zimbabwe self is daar die ekonomiese ineenstorting.
Ek verwys hier na 'n inflasiekoers van 80%, die brandstofsituasie,
toerisme, asook die knak van 'n uiters belangrike bedryf soos byvoorbeeld
kommersiële landbou, aangesien daardie mense die land uitstroom. Vanuit die
oogpunt van albei lande, is daar net ellende. Ons President moet hard en
reguit praat. Hy moet leer uit die Zimbabwiese situasie en Suid-Afrika red
van 'n Zimbabwe-situasie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)
[Gen C L VILJOEN: Mr Chairman, from whichever angle one looks at Zimbabwe,
nothing good can be said about the present situation. Firstly, viewed from
the African angle - our continent, that continent that yearns for growth
and stability - Zimbabwe's contempt for the judiciary, its shameless
intimidation of the opposition, its violation of human rights and its
contempt for the role of the media, must be described as a disgrace for
Africa.
Secondly, Zimbabwe's participation in and incitement of fighting in the
DRC, the creation and incitement of a situation of instability in that
area, with the concomitant senseless loss of lives, can only be described
in one way, and that is that the country poses a threat to Africa.
Thirdly, Zimbabwe strips Africa of any investor confidence and Zimbabwe
strips Africa of the hope we all pinned our hopes on. There is only one
description for that and that is the impoverishment of Africa.
Seen from South Africa's point of view Zimbabwe is a slap in the face of
President Mbeki, who, for a long time - perhaps too long - tried to
practise the typically African kind of diplomacy, namely quiet diplomacy.
Zimbabwe is a threat to us and the unstable situation in that country will
spill over into our country. Zimbabwe has a big negative economic impact on
South Africa. It is bad for business activities between the two countries.
It is also bad for the consolidation of the democracy of the region.
From the point of view of Zimbabwe itself there is the economic collapse. I
am referring here to an 80% inflation rate, the fuel situation, tourism, as
well as breaking the back of an extremely important industry like
commercial farming, for example, since those people are leaving the country
in droves. From the point of view of both countries there is only misery.
Our President should speak loudly and candidly. He should learn from the
Zimbabwean situation and save South Africa from a Zimbabwe-type situation.]
Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, Deputy President, it is indeed a welcome
and a long overdue move by the South African President Thabo Mbeki to
announce that the Zimbabwean economic and political situation warrants
urgent attention, hence his proposal to meet with his counterpart,
President Mugabe.
Whilst we acknowledge that Zimbabwe is a sovereign state, worthy and able
to administer its own affairs, we are concerned about the silence of some
influential African countries and international organisations in advising
the Zimbabwean government appropriately in the search for a long-lasting
solution to its problems. The South African Government has been rightfully
accused by the international community and both the people of Zimbabwe and
South Africa of keeping quiet or at least sending often-confusing signals
as a result of the manner in which this country has handled the political
situation in Zimbabwe.
As Africans it is in our nature, when our neighbour's house is on fire,
immediately to rush to his rescue and extinguish the fire, even though we
have not been asked to help. But as an African I am morally bound to act or
intervene in the best interests of my neighbour. This is what characterises
the nature of the African.
There are already sanctions against Zimbabwe by leading international
financial institutions, and this action is clearly harming the poorest of
the poor, not the ruling elite. The country is currently experiencing a
chronic shortage of foreign currency to meet its obligations, such as
payments of long-overdue energy accounts, hence the shortage of petrol and
other basic necessities. It is common cause that the government of Zimbabwe
has notably by and large adopted a confrontational route in dealing with
any dissenting voice. I am particularly referring to the manner in which
the opposition parties, judges, structures and civil society are being
treated. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, Zimbabwe is not the 10th province of South
Africa. [Interjections.] It is an independent neighbouring country with
which we have deep historic ties. Like Swaziland, Namibia, Botswana,
Lesotho and Mozambique, it should enjoy its territorial integrity and full
autonomy and be treated with the appropriate respect. [Interjections.]
We do not have to agree with everything that happens in Zimbabwe, as, in
fact, we do not agree with everything that happens in Lesotho, Nigeria,
Kenya, Bosnia, Israel, Ireland or even the USA and the UK. [Interjections.]
These countries also do not have to agree with everything we say or do. We
can express our views, as happens in every democratic society. But to use
prime time of this Parliament to discuss events in Zimbabwe smacks of
impatience bordering on arrogance. [Interjections.]
I do not know how many times the name ``Zimbabwe'' is uttered in this
House. None of our own provinces enjoy that type of attention. The basic
problem in Zimbabwe is historic, unjust and inequitable land distribution.
Many colonial powers left a legacy of dispossession of the indigenous
people. The British Empire, with their Afrikaner-Dutch partners in
government, does not have a good track record.
Kenya, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are glaring examples. In the case
of Kenya the Mau Mau revolution had to be resorted to, although the problem
still exists today. Although Zimbabwe gained its independence in 1980, 6
000 white farmers own 15,5 million hectares, about 45%, of good prime land,
and 12 million Africans, 75% of the population, were allocated 17,5 million
hectares in mostly infertile and arid areas.
This is an explosive situation which the Lancaster conference failed to
resolve. The Zimbabwean situation has ingredients of a racial war ...
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.
Dr M S MOGOBA: ... which we should handle with extreme care.
[Interjections.] Hatred is no basis for reform. [Interjections.] If there
is fear, mistrust or hatred there cannot be reform or peace.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]
Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the situation in Zimbabwe is a political time
bomb which has ignited fear amongst minorities in South Africa, especially
agricultural landowners, who were privileged during the apartheid regime.
However, the President assured the country that Zimbabwe-style land
occupation will not happen here. Property rights are protected by the
Constitution.
We are seven years into democracy and have not succeeded in redistributing
at least 30% of the land to the historically disadvantaged, as promised.
Almost 80% of agricultural land is still owned by farmers. Although it is
unfair to make a simplistic comparison between Zimbabwe and South Africa,
one cannot help but perceive that the discontent and frustration the
millions of poor are feeling can be expressed in an unstoppable, massive
movement for quick social change.
The pressure is on our President to pursue a workable solution in Zimbabwe.
While we are all investing our energy in trying to resolve the Zimbabwe
crises, the Government must also appease the millions of landless people in
South Africa. Therefore, land redistribution has to be urgently
accelerated.
To redress the situation in Zimbabwe requires of the entire Southern
African community region to exert pressure on President Robert Mugabe to,
firstly, condemn violence; secondly, encourage citizens to follow the rule
of law; and thirdly, attain a more equitable distribution of land by
encouraging white farmers, based on fair principles of land redistribution,
to sell to their black comrades. More effective engagement of the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change by SADC authorities is crucial if
there is to be a peaceful end to the intimidatory tactics of the ruling
party.
President Mbeki told reporters after a weekend meeting with the
International Investment Council ...
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your speaking time has
expired.
Miss S RAJBALLY: ...``some of the things that have been happening recently
are to all of us as South Africans a matter of very serious concern.''
[Applause.]
Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, elke Oujaarsaand sing ons 'n liedjie:
``Sal ons ou vriende ooit vergeet'', en dit is presies wat hier gebeur wat
betref Suid-Afrika se verhouding met Zimbabwe. Maak nie saak wat Mugabe
doen nie, maak nie saak hoe menseregte vertrap word nie, hy is 'n vriend,
en hy sal nie vergeet word nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]
Eiendomsreg wat nie erken word nie, die bedreiging van die onafhanklikheid
van die regbank en persvryheid, die destabilisering in die DRK, al hierdie
dinge het een gemeenskaplike faktor: magswellus. Hierdie is dinge wat nodig
was om steun te mobiliseer vir 'n tiran wat 'n verkiesing nie sou wen nie.
Ek wil agb lede wys op die duidelike inkonsekwenthede, in vandag se debat
alleen, in die ANC se hantering van hierdie saak. Daar is duidelik gesê
deur die hoofsweep dat ons alle vergrype moet veroordeel, ook in Israel en
ook die bomme op Irak. Die ironie is, die ANC het hom nog nooit in
duidelike taal uitgespreek teen wat in Zimbabwe gebeur nie. Daar was nie 'n
mosie of 'n duidelike uitspraak daaroor nie, dit terwyl dit op ons reën oor
hierdie ander lande. [Tussenwerpsels.]
'n AGB LID: Wat van Dr Jordan s'n?
Mnr C AUCAMP: Ja, behalwe Dr Jordan s'n, wat julle teruggetrek het. 'n
Verdere bewys van die dubbele agenda was toe die hoofsweep vertel het van
die vrugbare gesprek met die MDC, maar toe die leier van die opposisie
verwys het na mense wat demokrasie liefhet in Zimbabwe, toe kreun die hele
Huis. [Tussenwerpsels.] 'n Beleid van nie-inmenging is hoogheilig, maar in
die tyd van die `struggle' is die hele wêreld opgeroep om die bestel hier
te beveg. Ons vra net meer konsekwentheid.
President Mbeki het die naweek erken dat Zimbabwe negatief op Suid- Afrika
inwerk. Miskien is dit te min te laat. Dit wat hy op aanbeveling van sy
internasionale beleggers gesê het, het omtrent al die partye in hierdie
Huis 'n jaar gelede al gesê. Hoeveel skade kon nie al voorkom gewees het
indien hy daarop gereageer het nie?
Soos alles loop die millenniumprojek vir die Afrika Renaissance in Zimbabwe
dood, want die ANC verwar die ``alienation'' van Zimbabwe met dié van
Mugabe. Dit is tyd om ou vriende te vergeet en na die realiteite van die
dag te kyk. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)
[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairman, every New Year's eve we sing a song: ``Should
old acquaintance be forgot'', and this is precisely what is happening here
with regard to South Africa's relationship with Zimbabwe. It does not
matter what Mugabe does, it does not matter how he tramples on human
rights, he is a friend, and he will not be forgotten. [Interjections.]
Freehold that is not recognised, the threat to the independence of the
judiciary and press freedom, the destabilising of the DRC, all these things
have one factor in common: megalomania. These are things that were
necessary to mobilise support for a tyrant who would not have won an
election.
I want to point out to hon members the obvious inconsistencies, in today's
debate alone, in the ANC's handling of this matter. The Chief Whip said
clearly that we should condemn all transgressions, also those in Israel and
the bombs dropped on Iraq. The irony is that the ANC has never expressed
itself explicitly against what is happening in Zimbabwe. There was no
motion or clear statement in that regard, and that while they are raining
down on us in regard to these other countries. [Interjections.]
An HON MEMBER: What about Dr Jordan's?
Mr C AUCAMP: Yes, except for Dr Jordan's, which you withdrew. Further proof
of the double agenda was when the Chief Whip spoke about the fruitful
discussion with the MDC, but when the Leader of the Opposition mentioned
people who loved democracy in Zimbabwe, the whole House groaned.
[Interjections.] A policy of non-interference is sacrosanct, but during the
time of the struggle the whole world was called on to fight the
dispensation here. We are simply asking for greater consistency.] President
Mbeki admitted this weekend that Zimbabwe is affecting South Africa
negatively. Perhaps it is too little too late. What he said on the
recommendation of his international investors had been said by almost all
the parties in this House a year ago already. How much damage could not
have been avoided if he had reacted to that?
Like everything, the millennium project for the African Renaissance is
grinding to a halt in Zimbabwe, because the ANC is confusing the alienation
of Zimbabwe with that of Mugabe. It is time to forget old friends and to
look at the realities of the day.]
Dr Z P JORDAN: Mr Chairperson, Comrade Deputy President, hon members,
comrades and colleagues, during a debate last year in this House, in answer
to a question posed by the hon Barbara Hogan, the President said:
The reason that this question is being raised is because there is a fear
and it might very well be understandable and explainable. Here one has a
black government across the Limpopo which is perceived to be doing
particular things regarding this land matter. What guarantee do we have
that the black government this side of the Limpopo will not do the same
thing? That is what is driving it.
[Interjections.] Hon members would do well to return to that particular
exchange, because I think it is quite enlightening about what happened in
this House and what the President has said on the issue of Zimbabwe. If,
indeed, what is driving the opposition's robust questioning about the
Government's approach to Zimbabwe are fears about South Africa itself, I
think it is proper that we be upfront about that and say so. Yes, there is
validity in raising prickly issues by employing allegories, but in this
particular instance the allegory that is being used has not only muddied
the waters, but it has also excited rather than allayed anxieties.
The ANC and the ANC-led Government have repeatedly said that ours is a
constitution-driven programme of transformation. Political opponents of the
Government have, quite legitimately, invoked the Constitution to test the
legality of the Government's actions and to compel definitive rulings on
issues of rights.
Addressing the legacy of colonialism and racism in this country is a
constitutionally mandated obligation and we know that all the parties of
this Parliament uphold and implement our Constitution. [Interjections.] It
is quite appropriate that as parties we disagree amongst ourselves about
the best means of carrying out that constitutional obligation, but I am
absolutely certain there is no party here that will try to evade that
constitutional mandate.
The central issue in Zimbabwe is precisely how to address the legacy of
colonialism in that country. Mr Morgan Tsvangirai assured us in talks
yesterday that his movement was as committed to that project as anyone
else. Transformation, whether in South Africa or in Zimbabwe, is not an
easy process. Let us accept that it will entail discomfort for some. Let us
accept also that it might entail unanticipated changes, that it might well
entail loss and pain. [Interjections.]
However, the virtue of a constitution-driven process is that it promotes
change through the law and within the law and with the full backing of the
law. Subversion of the rule of law cannot be helpful; it merely promotes
disorder and heightens tension. On that score, no party in this Parliament
has been silent, and, just for the record, let me remind hon members that
it was the ANC that first placed the issue of what was happening in
Zimbabwe on the agenda of this House. [Interjections.]
Let me add also, just to correct a misapprehension on the part of the hon
Van Schalkwyk, that no one, I repeat, no one ... [Interjections.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I hope we want to listen to the
debate from both sides of the House. Could we please give members who are
at the podium a chance to be heard. Continue, Dr Pallo Jordan.
Dr Z P JORDAN: Mr Chairperson, I want to add that no one, least of all the
leadership of the ANC, ever pressured me to withdraw any motion that I put
before this House. I never withdrew it and the member should look at the
record if he can read. [Laughter.] Rather than using the unfortunate events
in Zimbabwe as a means of stimulating and kindling fears and anxiety
amongst the minority groups in our own country, I submit that the
opposition would serve the people of South Africa and Zimbabwe better by
persuading their own constituencies to throw their weight behind our own
Constitution-driven programme of transformation. The opposition should be
urging its supporters to say yes to land reform, yes to land
redistribution, yes to the restitution of land, yes to decent wages and
working conditions and yes to collective bargaining for the agricultural
sector.
I want to pose a question: After President Mbeki has shouted himself hoarse
in denouncing President Mugabe, what would the Leader of the Opposition, my
good friend Max du Preez and the editors of the Sunday Times propose he
does as a second act? I want to urge us all to weigh up in earnest and
seriously what the probable outcomes of the courses of action we propose
would be. Let us remember also that whatever its faults, the government led
by President Mugabe, unlike that of Ian Smith or even that led by F W de
Klerk, is a legitimate and an elected government ... [Laughter] ... elected
in a process that an all- party observer mission from this Parliament found
acceptable.
The political hyperbole of calling Mugabe a tyrant makes good headlines.
But does it make political sense? Would Zimbabwe's economic collapse be to
South Africa's advantage? Unlike South Africa during the days of apartheid,
there is no body of opinion in Zimbabwe which demands sanctions. Yesterday,
when we met the MDC leadership, they told us that they were opposed to
sanctions. The political and economic stability of Zimbabwe and of the
region requires of us as South Africans to be measured both in our
pronouncements and in our actions.
Our task is to assist the people of Zimbabwe to arrive at a solution, and
not to compound their problems by pursuing ill-advised actions. Economic
and political stability are what Zimbabwe needs. We in the ANC have
undertaken to assist the people of Zimbabwe to arrive at these. Anything
else would be irresponsible. We invite those South Africans who are serious
to join us in that effort. [Applause.]
Mr C W EGLIN: Mr Chairperson, I know of no one in Zimbabwe with whom I have
discussed the issue, no one in this House with whom I have discussed it,
and no one in the international donor community that has not agreed that
the land issue in Zimbabwe should be handled in a lawful and orderly way.
There is no dispute anywhere on this particular issue.
But the hon the Chief Whip of the Majority Party gave a spirited defence of
the way in which Mr Mugabe's government has been handling it. I want to
give him a different interpretation from someone who says that it is at the
core of the liberation struggle and that it is important that it should be
addressed in an orderly manner. It goes on to say that they could not
associate themselves with the chaotic and anarchistic fast-track settlement
programme unleashed by the Zimbabwean government in the year 2000.
The programme was a flagrant disregard of the law and unleashed a wave of
violence that threatened the very stability of society. Even more
disgusting was the violence by party hooligans which was directed at
farmworkers. We are not convinced that this was a genuine programme. To
mask its failures and faced by the prospect of a credible opposition, the
government opportunistiscally used the land question to deflect attention
from its failures. The fast-tracked land settlement programme was nothing
less than an election gimmick. This was a statement in an article by
Zwelinzima Vavi, the Cosatu General Secretary, to define Cosatu's position
on the land settlement programme and is one of the few occasions on which I
advise the Government to follow the lead set by Cosatu. [Interjections.]
Surely there can be no member of the House who is in any doubt, at this
stage, that the undemocratic and massive actions of Mugabe's government and
his political cohorts are doing enormous damage to all the countries of the
Southern African region. They are tarnishing the region's image. They are
undermining investor and trading confidence. They are destabilising the
region's economy. They are destroying the integrity of the region's
commitment to uphold democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
This is not just because the countries of the region are neighbours and
trading partners with Zimbabwe: It is because all of us in this region are
also linked with Zimbabwe through our common membership of SADC, an
organisation through which we are bound to work for the economic,
developmental and political integration of the region, an organ through
which we are bound to uphold ``the principles of democracy, human rights
and the rule of law''.
Thus, no country in this region is insulated from the events that are
taking place in Zimbabwe. Every action that Zimbabwe undertakes to
undermine democracy impacts on each one of us. Every action that undermines
the rule of law and gives presidential legitimacy to lawlessness impacts on
each one of us. Every action that undermines the authority of the courts
and the independence of the judiciary impacts on each one of us. Every
threat to press freedom, every racist attract on minorities and every
government-inspired act of political thuggery impacts on each one of us.
Because of the commitment of SADC to uphold democracy, human rights and the
rule of law, the decision to ignore the events in Zimbabwe taken by the
Council of Ministers at its recent meeting - referred to by the Leader of
the Opposition - is, I can say, distressingly feeble. According to the
chairperson the council sees it as an internal matter which has nothing to
do with SADC.
What a far cry from the challenging leadership given by President Mandela
when he was president of SADC, and I quote:
   Democracy and human rights are regional concerns, not national ones
   protected by the principle of noninterference in other's internal
   affairs.
He went on to say:
   Can we continue to give comfort to member states whose actions are so
   diametrically against the values and principles we hold so dear and for
   which we struggled so long and so hard?
It is clear that whatever was intended, the form of quiet diplomacy as
practised by the Government has failed to achieve any tangible results in
Zimbabwe. But it has succeeded in obfuscating South Africa's position in
response to the Zimbabwean issues.
The DA welcomes the recent shift of emphasis in President Mbeki's approach
to diplomacy and the element of urgency. However, there are certain dangers
attached to the diplomacy, and I hope he will attend to them. The quietness
of diplomacy must not allow anyone to come to the mistaken conclusion that
the South African Government is not serious about its international
commitment to promote democracy, human rights and the rule of law or that,
for the sake of old-time solidarity, it is prepared to turn a blind eye to
undemocratic and repressive behaviour.
The opaqueness of diplomacy must never be allowed to conceal the very real
differences that exist. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Mr Chairperson, Deputy
President, hon members, comrades and friends, I sat listening to the debate
and I repeatedly heard members of the opposition raising questions about
what they think has not been said. In referring to the weekend statement,
they welcomed the emphasis on the change that has been reflected by our
President.
I think it is important to remind hon members that what the President said
over the weekend has been said many times.
It has also been said in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe itself, in May 2000. Maybe the
issue that we need to ask ourselves is, what is it that we want to hear,
that we do not hear? What is, therefore, the concern that underpins the
critique of the manner in which this Government has acted? What is this
concern that selectively decides that where there are problems in a
neighbouring country, a particular player must repeatedly comment on the
situation next door? What is this special case that holds only in the case
of South Africa refusing to repeat itself on the position of Zimbabwe?
After due consideration of the situation, it would seem that many people
would choose even to go to the extent of saying that markets will react
this way or that way, foreign direct investments will go away and so on. I
must say I find no evidence, in the decades-long instability in Ireland,
that England, Wales or Scotland was pressurised by all these comments and
even by the threat to the markets to the point where their leadership in
government rendered them unable to govern without making pronouncements on
the situation in Ireland.
Dr M Scott, in his book The Different Drums says:
   Community is like marriage. It requires that we hang in there when the
   going gets a little rough.
He goes on to say:
   As members of the community become vulnerable and find themselves being
   valued and appreciated, the wall comes tumbling down, the love and
   acceptance escalates, the healing and converting begins.
As a young South African, this is a profound statement which epitomises how
a number of us seated here in this House felt post 1990, and subsequently
during the negotiations process and thereafter. The route we chose as a
country was captured in the phrase I raised in my introduction. All of us
decided to hang in there. For better or for worse, we were South Africans.
We put in place processes that sought to deal with our past in a manner
that ensured protecting and defending the rights of all, while we attended
to the issues of social justice. This is a choice we made. We could have
chosen another way. We could have had terrible consequences for all of us
in this country and the region. However, we chose peace, negotiation and
compromise. This we did in order to rebuild and reconcile. It is,
therefore, critical that such experiences are shared with many people in a
manner that seeks to build.
We created an environment in which every South African felt they belonged
to this country. No one said it was going to be easy. A number of
challenges that we still face are part of the process of being born again
as a new society. The environment we created meant that our people can find
each other, learn to accept without shame, who we were and what we did in
hurting some of us.
The acknowledgement in the Constitution, of dealing with land reform, was
but one element where we had to face our past and move on in order to build
this community. Today's debate, therefore, should enable us to seek ways in
which we can work together to find a solution to a number of issues and
challenges facing the people of Zimbabwe.
The President in his address at the Trade Fair in Bulawayo last year said,
and I quote:
Inevitably, therefore, both of us have the responsibility that extends
beyond our borders, and have to respond to this basing ourselves on the
regional solidarity and unity in action we achieved during the difficult
years of struggle for liberation.
Today's debate calls on us all to re-examine what it is we can do to assist
the process of transformation in that country, in a manner that addresses
the needs of all the Zimbabwean people.
A close study of the land issue in Zimbabwe will reveal that among the
chief reasons for the failure to resolve the problem has been the inability
of participants brokering the situation to put the interests of Zimbabweans
at the centre of their efforts. Consequently, any future efforts to assist
in a process that does not put Zimbabweans at the centre are destined to
fail.
The land question in Zimbabwe dates back to the subjugation of the Shona
and Ndebele indigenous people, of that country. The fact that land was the
central issue in the liberation war is a known fact and is not up for
debate. However, as Thomas Ohlson, Stephen John Stedman and Rob Davis, who
is a member of this Parliament, state in their book entitled The New is Not
Yet Born: Conflict Resolution in Southern Africa, and I quote:
The terms of the Lancaster House agreement dealt with only one aspect of
the conflict in Zimbabwe: the political domination of whites over blacks.
The Lancaster House settlement clearly changed that. Racial reconciliation,
however, was bought at a high cost. The Lancaster House agreement increased
political participation by blacks only in exchange for constraints of
economic demands for redistribution.
The consequences and the aftermath of the Lancaster House agreement are
part of the reality that we have to deal with today. The current situation
as regards the land issue can therefore be said to be the direct
consequence of that agreement. While not denying that the issue deserves
attention, the current debate on Zimbabwe arises because some of us here
may have inherent fears about the resolution of the land question.
As the Minister for Agriculture I must say that in the experiences where we
have resolved some of the claims one has seen the pain of the loss by those
who are current landowners, and the rejoicing of those people whose land
was previously taken away from them. It has been the pain of the legacy of
apartheid, which continues to haunt our lives today. Therefore, when such
fears arise it is important that we understand.
But, clearly, it is true, of course, that our situation with regard to land
reform is well known. It is founded on the Constitution and therefore it
cannot change. It is based on the market, which allows for negotiations
between parties; appeal through courts where there is no agreement; and an
expropriation element, which can be undertaken in the public interest. Its
strength lies in the transparency in which negotiations for acquisition
involve both the claimants and the current landowners.
However, in order to avoid such unacceptable developments as land invasion
taking root in our country, we must continue to insist upon, and implement
diligently, an orderly and well-planned process. Our Government has said
repeatedly that land invasions will never occur in South Africa.
However, the success of the land reform process depends not only on the
efficiency of the Government, but also, and crucially, on the positive role
that must be played by all. When elders engage in resolving a troubled
marriage, they do so through dialogue with families and friends, including
negotiators or abakhongi and the parties to the problem. Clearly when they
do so, their interest is to build rather than destroy.
Our approach as this Government, particularly as the ANC, in dealing with
the Zimbabwean question seeks to build, not to destroy. As South Africa we
will play our part. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.
  CONSIDERATION OF FIRST REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS -
                    CONSTITUTIVE ACT OF THE AFRICAN UNION
Mr E I EBRAHIM: Mr Chairperson, the ratification of the Constitutive Act of
The African Union by this democratic Parliament today is an historic act,
and clearly signals our deep commitment to African unity and African
development.
The African Union Act, while admittedly needing greater clarity in its
wording, is a bold and exciting step forward for Africa. It gives concrete
expression to our vision of an African Renaissance, which is fundamental
for achieving the goal of making the 21st century an African century.
The Act lays the foundation for the establishment of an African Union which
will replace the OAU. The OAU and the African Union will coexist for a
transitional period of a year or more in order to provide for a smooth
transition. It will establish a Pan-African Parliament, and will also
provide for the establishment of a court of justice, an African Central
Bank, an African Monetary Fund and an African Investment Bank.
With the demise of the OAU in its present form, we need to reflect briefly
on and pay tribute to the OAU's nearly four decades of existence. The
principle task of the OAU was to liberate our continent from colonial and
imperialist oppression. The OAU was unwavering in its support for the
liberation struggle on our continent, and especially in its support for
Southern African liberation movements, including our own in South Africa.
It gave both material and moral support to the liberation movements, and
worked hard to place the African revolutionary agenda on the international
fora. It is a great tribute to the OAU that Africa today is free from all
foreign colonial domination.
The OAU also established the principle of the inviolability of postcolonial
borders. In the postcolonial era of intensified globalisation, the struggle
against poverty, disease, the foreign debt burden, and unfair trade
barriers require a new form of organisation.
The Millennium African Recovery Programme, known as MARP, is, according to
our President, a declaration of a firm commitment by African leaders to
take ownership and responsibility for the sustainable economic development
of the continent. The organisational structures for the successful
implementation of MARP could be found in this African Union Act.
The African Union Act expresses a determination -
... to take up the multifaceted challenges that confront our continent and
peoples in the light of the social, economic and political changes that are
taking place in the world.
The African Union Act has been inspired by the noble ideals which guided
the great leaders of the liberation movements and generations of Pan-
Africanists in their determination to promote unity, solidarity, cohesion
and co-operation among the people of Africa and the African states. We,
therefore, without reservation, ratify the Constitutive Act of the African
Union.
Dr J T DELPORT: Mr Chairperson, Ex Africis semper aliquid novis [something
new will always come out of Africa] became a very well- known expression
when people of the western tradition were again and again amazed by the
wonders of our Africa. The sad truth is that it is more apt today to say:
Ex Africis aliquid semper horrendi [something dreadful will always come out
of Africa].
We are dealing today with a new organisation for Africa. We need more than
that. We also need a new vision. The DP and DA support the acceptance of
the Constitutive Act of the African Union. This, however, does not minimise
the fact that the documents setting out what is supposed to be the
constitution of the African Union are badly drafted. I wish, in fact, to
refer hon members to the report before them. It bluntly states:
However, the Act appears to contain -
   (i)      various clauses that could be open to different interpretations;
   (ii)     various clauses that appear to be contradictory; and
   (iii)    clauses that may be interpreted as impinging upon the
           sovereignty of Member States, in the executive, legislative or
           judicial spheres, more than is usual in the case of the
           formation of such a Union.
This is a bad start. It invites dissent. It invites malfunctioning and it
invites long debates on the legality or otherwise of the functioning of the
African Union. Parliament, by adopting this report and taking cognisance of
the negative aspects that are pointed out, will be advising our executive
of the pitfalls that lie ahead and will in fact be calling upon the
representatives of the Republic of South Africa to take the initiative and
guide the further development of the Act. Such development will take place
by the decisions of that parliament and that council, and by protocols and
even revisions and amendments to the constitution.
The African Union is set to replace the Organisation of African Unity. The
envisaged demise of the OAU is to be applauded. Seldom in history has an
international organisation, which was supposed to bring about peace and
prosperity, been such a dismal failure. During its existence Africa, as a
continent, has fallen back into the clutches of war and even genocide,
famine, pestilence, rebellion, civil war and the destruction of
developmental frameworks. The three horsemen never had it so good.
Time does not allow me to quote all the relevant figures. Millions of
people have died and been killed. There are 7,3 million people who are
presently refugees. [Interjections.] That member is sitting pretty. He is a
fat cat sitting here. He is not in Africa. [Interjections.] Perhaps the
most telling of all statistics is the one on child victims. I urge members
to listen to what the statistics are on child victims of war over the last
decade. Two million children have been killed, 4 to 5 million disabled, 12
million left homeless, more than 1 million orphaned or separated from their
parents and some 10 million psychologically traumatised.
It is hoped that President Mbeki will be able to instil in the envisaged
African Union his concept of an African Renaissance. Africa does not merely
need a new organisation, Africa needs a new vision. At present Africa, led
by the example of Mugabe, is sinking back into the Dark Ages. It will be
the duty of the Republic of South Africa, led by the President, to call
upon the members of the African Union to stop the killing and destruction
and to start working. Africa needs ploughs, not cannons.
The rich potential of the African continent can only be realised if Africa
is willing to take up the spade. When the world sees Africa at work and not
at war, that is the day upon which the African Renaissance will dawn. Then,
if we set the example, we hopefully in future will be able to say: Ex
Africis semper lux. [In Africa there will always be light.] [Applause.]
Mr E J LUCAS: Mr Chairman, the IFP endorses the ratification of the
Constitutive Act of the African Union. We recognise the important role that
will be played by South Africa in identifying and implementing the key
principles and goals that will underpin African unity. Therefore, it is
imperative that this House and, indeed, the nation are united in this
matter, to ensure the success of the African Union. Failure in this regard
could undermine the whole process.
The committee would like to recommend that during the process of
negotiation, drafting and adoption of the relevant protocols and the
implementation of the Act, Parliament should be informed and consulted in
order to strengthen the position of our negotiating team. The IFP regards
this to be of paramount importance.
Article 3(b) requires states to defend the sovereignty, territorial
integrity and independence of member states. Whilst this is a commendable
object, the practical considerations of realising it are manifold, not
least to ensure that all member states fulfil their financial obligations
and that it is not solely borne by a few dedicated member states.
That said, we believe that the provisions of the Constitutive Act of the
African Union can provide for raising living standards, security and
stability in Africa. When one considers the long evolution of the European
Union to its present form, one must acknowledge that African unity will not
be secured immediately or without obstacles. Africa is a continent with a
rich diversity of cultures and group formation which require sensitivity
and understanding in the quest for unity.
Finally, article 30 of the Act provides that governments which come to
power through unconstitutional means shall not be allowed to participate in
the activities of the union. By faithful adherence to the democratic
principle and the rule of law, member states, by their exemplary conduct,
will encourage others to change. That is our most noble legacy to all
Africans.
Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Voorsitter, Paulus skryf in een van sy briewe: ``Hoewel
ons in die wêreld is, is ons nie van die wêreld nie.'' Vir 'n baie lank tyd
was daar ook in Suid-Afrika die opvatting onder 'n deel van die gemeenskap
dat hoewel ons in Afrika is, ons nie van Afrika is nie. Die siening is nie
meer geldig in die een-en-twintigste eeu nie. Ons is almal in Afrika en van
Afrika en lidmaatskap van die Afrika Unie is daarom noodsaaklik en die Nuwe
NP steun die wet wat dit magtig. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)
[Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, Paul wrote in one of his epistles:
``Although we live in the world, we are not of the world.'' For a very long
time a certain section of the South African community was also of the view
that although we lived in Africa, we were not of Africa. This view is no
longer valid in the twenty-first century. All of us are in Africa and of
Africa, and for this reason membership of the African Union is essential,
and the New NP supports the Act authorising this.]
The time has arrived for South Africa to come in from the cold and to
pursue a leadership role on the continent that will make it possible for
Africa to survive in the sea of globalisation. The provisions of the Act
that establishes the African Union give South Africa an excellent
opportunity to promote, inter alia, President Mbeki's vision of a
Millennium African Recovery
Programme. The approval of the Act is, therefore, important.
When South Africa takes the chair of the African Union next year, it will
have an obligation to exercise leadership in many fields, of which the
interpretation of article 4 of the Act, which deals with the underlying
principles, is among the most important. Article 4(g) guarantees
noninterference by any member state in the internal affairs of another, and
article 4(m) encourages respect for democratic principles, human rights,
the rule of law and good governance. But what has, up to now, caused the
downfall of Africa in many respects and has been detrimental to progress
and development is the fact that the so-called noninterference principles
have overridden the human rights principles in many countries.
The noninterference principle is merely used as a fig leaf to continue with
violations of the rule of law, disregard for the democratic principles and
contempt for human rights. Under the leadership of South Africa, member
states should be convinced that human rights are universal. There may be
such a thing as capitalism with Chinese characteristics, but there can
never be such a thing as human rights with Nigerian characteristics or,
perhaps more appropriate, with Zimbabwean characteristics.
Once the universality of human rights is firmly embedded in the continent,
Africa will get its fair share of foreign investment conducive to economic
development. Against this backdrop the idea of an African economic
community may become a reality sooner rather than later. [Applause.]
Mr M E MABETA: Chairperson, hon members of Parliament, Deputy President,
the UDM would like to commend the Speaker of this House for the important
role she has played in the development of this Act. The fact that so many
countries are involved in this debate on the African Union is a strong
indication of the level of maturity on political processes underlying the
quest by Africans for the advancement of democratisation and strategies for
sustainable economic relationships with the rest of the world that is
defined by globalisation.
There are, indeed, many impediments to union, but the vision and the
mission for union must not be allowed to be weakened or stifled by specific
problems, for most of these problems are in any case engineered from
outside. How else does one explain Europe's success in the development of a
workable economy and securing common policies outside the UN framework, and
at the same time accept a scenario which rejects the practical advantages
of an African union?
There are inevitably legal problems concerning the various treaties and
protocols which need to be negotiated, but these should not warrant
political rejection of an African union, which in any case already exists
in the form of regional arrangements, such as the ability of the West
African states to collaborate on shared defence issues, without undermining
the sovereignty of these states.
This is but one example illustrating the possibility of reconciling and
harmonising the various member states, domestic, international and legal
obligations; and the normative change in the developments of the UN system,
which to this day have been help captive by the United Nations' own
insistence on a state-centric view of the international community. We are
especially challenged as a people to play a leading role in the further
articulation and reorientation of the international norms and practices.
[Time expired.]
Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, the ACDP appreciates that this Act will have
some far-reaching implications and obligations for South Africa. However,
South Africa would not be able to continue its prominent role in the
subregion and on the continent if it remained outside the workings of the
Act.
As is mentioned in the committee's report, however, the Act contains
clauses that are problematic, particularly those clauses that may be
interpreted as impinging on the sovereignty of member states. A
particularly disturbing clause in this regard allows for the executive
council of the union to take decisions on policies in areas of common
interest such as education and social security. We accept, however, the
view of the Department of Foreign Affairs that this Act is a mere skeletal
framework underpinning African unity and that the potential problems
identified by the portfolio committees would be dealt with by way of
negotiation and the adoption of various protocols, including a possible
revision for amendment of the Act.
This Act must be distinguished from the Abuja treaty, which is a very
detailed and specific agreement to promote fair trade on the continent and
economic unity. The vagueness and generality of this Act will allow room
for South Africa to implement it in accordance with our existing
international rights and obligations. It is a political document which
enunciates principles and goals for African unity.
The ACDP supports the recommendation that, beside the executive monitoring
the process leading to the adoption and implementation of the Act,
parliamentary portfolio committees should be kept informed of the process
on a continuous basis. We as South Africans must be on the playing field to
be an effective role-player in the negotiations leading up to the
establishment of the African Union as a successor to the Organisation of
African Unity, and therefore the ACDP supports the ratification of this
Act.
Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, the PAC welcomes the Constitutive Act of the
African Union. What this Act is creating today did not fall from the sky.
Pan-Africanists have been working hard for the realisation of the Pan-
African vision for over 100 years. The PAC is particularly happy because
this Parliament is adopting the Constitutive Act of the African Union on 27
February which, on the PAC calendar, is Sobukwe Day.
In January 1960, Mangaliso Robert Sobukwe wrote an article in Drum
Magazine, giving the PAC position on the unification of Africa. He
declared, and I quote:
For many Africans the united states of Africa symbolises the fulfilment of
an emotional urge for formal African unity. The Pan- African effort is not
an end in itself; it is a means to an end. Africa can redeem herself only
in unity and reclaim her rightful place in world affairs, and use her
riches for her own development and technological advancement.
Therefore the PAC supports the ratification of this Act. [Applause.]
Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, President Mbeki signed the Act on behalf of
South Africa two months after the 33 member states of the OAU adopted the
Act in July 2000. The reason for creating the African Union emerged at a
meeting that was held in Algiers in 1999, at which Muammar Gadaffi raised
issues on how best to tackle Africa's problems.
According to Mr W Nhlapho, Deputy Director-General in the Chief Directorate
of African Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, certain issues, such
as conflict on the continent, have not been catered for in the Constitutive
Act of the African Union. He said that the Act did not ensure the African
Union's effective response with regard to such matters, and posed the
question as to whether we have the kind of leadership that can tackle such
challenges.
An ANC member said that the continent was at a different level of
consciousness and that there were many impediments to be overcome in order
to attain the continent's objective. But we must not be weakened. The MF
supports this ratification. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.
Report adopted.
The House adjourned at 17:07.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:
National Assembly:
1.    First Report of the Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs on/P>
    Constitutive Act of the African Union, dated 27 February 2001:
The Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs, having considered the request
for approval by Parliament of the Constitutive Act of the African Union,
referred to it, and having consulted the Portfolio Committee on Justice and
Constitutional Development and the Portfolio Committee on Finance,
recommends that the House, in terms of section 231(2) of the Constitution,
approve the international agreement containing the Constitutive Act.
Report to be considered.
2.    Second Report of the Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs onlio
    Constitutive Act of the African Union, dated 27 February 2001:
The Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs, having considered the request
for approval by Parliament of the Constitutive Act of the African Union,
referred to it, and having consulted the Portfolio Committee on Justice and
Constitutional Development and the Portfolio Committee on Finance, further
reports as follows:
1.    The Committee does not wish to, and should not be understood to, be
    proposing the adoption of any reservations or of a declaration in
    respect of the said Act.
2.    The Committee accepted that the Act would have some far-reaching
    implications and obligations for South Africa, but that South Africa
    would not be able to continue its prominent role in the subregion and
    on the continent if it remained outside the framework of the Act.
    Although there is understanding for the implications the Act has for
    South Africa, it is, from a political point of view, imperative that
    the Act be ratified as a matter of priority if South Africa wishes to
    remain a committed, influential and credible member of both the OAU/AEC
    and the SADC.
3.    However, the Act appears to contain -
    (i)     various clauses that could be open to different
           interpretations;
    (ii)    various clauses that appear to be contradictory; and
    (iii)   clauses that may be interpreted as impinging upon the
           sovereignty of Member States, in the executive, legislative or
           judicial spheres, more than is usual in the case of the
           formation of such a Union.
4.    Due to constraints of time and information, the Committee wishes to
    only highlight two such examples, which are possibly of a more serious
    nature.
5.    Firstly, there are the various clauses that deal with the issue of
    socio-economic policies and integration of the continent, in a
    potentially contradictory manner, or which may be interpreted as
    possibly impinging on the sovereignty of the Member States, or which,
    at the very least, could be open to various interpretations.
On the one hand, there are provisions providing -
    (i)     in article 3(c), that an objective of the Union shall be to
           accelerate the political and socio-economic integration of the
           continent;
    (ii)    in article 3(l), that an objective of the Union shall be to co-
           ordinate and harmonise the policies between the existing and
           future Regional Economic Communities for the gradual attainment
           of the objectives of the Union;
    (iii)   in articles 9(1)(a) and (e), that the Assembly shall determine
           the common policies of the Union and monitor the implementation
           of policies and decisions of the Union; and
    (iv)    in article 13(2), that the Executive Council shall be
           responsible to the Assembly, and shall consider issues referred
           to it and monitor the implementation of policies formulated by
           the Assembly.
On the other hand, there are provisions providing -
           (i)   in article 13(1), that the Executive Council shall co-
                 ordinate and take decisions on policies in areas of common
                 interest to the Member States, and then 12 such specific
                 grounds are included, like education, social security and
                 so on; and
           (ii)  in article 11, that the decisions of the Executive Council
               may be taken by a two thirds majority of the Member States.
6.    Secondly, the issue of whether the Act is consistent with
    International Law and South Africa's international obligations,
    requires examination.
In this regard there are some provisions, read individually or
collectively, which require further attention, namely -
    (i)     article 3(b), requiring states to defend the sovereignty,
           territorial integrity and independence of its Member States;
    (ii)    article 4(d), on the establishment of a common defence policy
           for the African Continent;
    (iii)   article 4(h), on the right of the Union to intervene in a
           Member State pursuant to a decision of the Assembly in respect
           of grave circumstances, namely war crimes, genocide and crimes
           against humanity;
    (iv)    article 4(j), on the right of Member States to request
           intervention from the Union in order to restore peace and
           security; and
    (v)     articles 7 and 11, allowing for decisions of the Assembly and
           the Executive Council, respectively, to be taken by a two thirds
           majority of the Member States.
The difficulty with these provisions, as presently worded, is that they may
be used to justify a use of force in contravention of International Law and
the Charter of the United Nations. Article 2(4) of the Charter of the
United Nations provides that all "Members shall refrain in their
international relations from the threat or use of force against the
territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any
other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations". In
exceptional circumstances, where force may be used, this can only be done
in self-defence or with the authorisation of the Security Council (Chapter
VII of the UN Charter).
It should also be noted that interventions and the use of armed force
without Security Council authorisation are illegal. According to prevailing
legal opinion, there is an indication that international law may be
changing in this regard. The recent NATO intervention in Kosovo (though by
no means uncontroversial) is a case in point. Furthermore, there is a trend
in interpreting Article 51 of the UN Charter (which condones the use of
force for individual or collective self-defence until the Security Council
has become seized of the matter) very widely to condone interventions.
Thus, it can be said that the aforementioned provisions do not per se give
a right to use force, but, at the very least, they may present the
opportunity for such an interpretation. Therefore, the conclusion may be
reached that both international law on the use of armed force and the
provisions of the Act are possibly open to interpretation. Having said
that, however, the possibility of having the Act conflict with
International Law, including the UN Charter, may be a serious one and must
be considered seriously.
7.    In response to the above issues and other matters raised by the
    Committee, the Department of Foreign Affairs has indicated that the Act
    is a mere skeletal framework underpinning such an African Union, which
    will have to be elaborated on for its effective implementation. This
    elaboration may take place by way of negotiation and adoption of
    various protocols on specific aspects of the Act or decisions of the
    Assembly or revision and amendment of the Act in accordance with
    Article 32. The Department is of the view that this will provide the
    opportunity to ensure that the potential problems identified by the
    Committee would be able to be dealt with through these processes, which
    are intended to concretise the provisions contained in the Act. The
    Committee agrees with this point of view and the approach suggested by
    the Department. The Committee recommends accordingly.
8.    It is recommended that the Executive monitor the processes leading to
    the adoption of the Act and the implementation of the Act upon
    adoption, to ensure that it is interpreted and applied in accordance
    with our Constitution and legal dispensation and our obligations under
    International Law and international conventions and treaties. The
    Committee would further like to recommend that, during the process of
    negotiation, drafting and adoption of such protocols and the
    implementation of the Act, Parliament be kept informed of progress,
    including, if and when possible, to be consulted on such processes, in
    an inclusive attempt to strengthen the hand of our negotiators during
    such processes.
Report to be considered.
