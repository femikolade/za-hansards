                  RULINGS AND REMARKS BY PRESIDING OFFICERS

                                  (Ruling)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! before we begin, I  wish  to  deliver  a
ruling in respect of remarks and rulings that were made during  the  sitting
on 27 September 2001.

I recently received correspondence concerning the remarks  and  the  rulings
of the officers presiding during the address by the Deputy President  on  27
September 2001. Having  referred  to  the  Hansard,  I  wish  to  take  this
opportunity to respond to the correspondence.

The remarks of the Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP were that he  had  allowed
the hon member Mr Matthee to proceed to debate a Bill which was  not  before
Parliament and which was also not the subject matter of the  debate  in  the
NCOP on that day. He concluded by saying that it was  not  a  matter  before
the House.

When  the  hon  member  Ms  Botha  proceeded  to  raise  the  issue  of  the
constitutional  amending  Bills  during  her  speech,  the  Chairperson   of
Committees  indicated  that,  given  the  earlier  remarks  of  the   Deputy
Chairperson, the member was referring to a  matter  that  was  still  to  be
tabled before the House. Her ruling was that the member  continue  with  her
speech, but refrain from referring to the matter.

Although the Chairperson of Committees did not expressly refer to NCOP  Rule
49, which deals with the anticipation of a discussion, it  would  seem  that
it was the Rule which was invoked. According to  the  Rule,  no  member  may
anticipate the discussion of a matter appearing on the Order Paper.

The Rule further provides that, in determining whether a matter  is  out  of
order on the ground of anticipation, the  officer  presiding  must  consider
whether it is probable that the matter anticipated will be discussed in  the
Council within a reasonable time. The Chairperson  of  Committees  therefore
had a discretion which she exercised accordingly.

I do wish to emphasise that the ruling must not be interpreted  as  implying
that members are being restricted in terms of the issues that they may  wish
to raise in the course of a debate. Members do address a range of  auxiliary
issues in the course of a debate. However, the  nature  of  a  parliamentary
debate and, indeed, the Rules require that  members  focus  on  the  subject
matter before the House. In particular, where there is a subject  or  motion
set for discussion, the expectation is that  members  will  adhere  to  that
subject or motion.

The constitutional amending Bill is on the  Order  Paper  and  members  will
have a full opportunity to debate it. The ruling  that  the  hon  member  Ms
Botha could not continue to speak on that subject was therefore correct.

By agreement of the Whippery, Notices of Motion will  be  dealt  with  after
the last Order of the Day.

                      PUBLIC SERVICE WAGE NEGOTIATIONS

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND  ADMINISTRATION:  Madam  Chairperson
and hon members of this House, every year the  Public  Service  enters  into
protracted negotiations with the Public Service unions on  wages  and  other
aspects of conditions of service.
This year, the Department of Public Service and  Administration,  encouraged
by agreements arrived at at the jobs summit, has  taken  an  innovative  and
strategic  approach  to  negotiating  the  2001-2004  negotiations  on   the
improvement of conditions of service for the  Public  Service  with  the  12
public sector unions.

I would like to present to this House this afternoon the  rationale,  status
and outcome of the negotiation process, and the  rest  that  came  about  in
terms of where we are today.

The start of  the  negotiations  was  characterised  by  deliberate  and,  I
believe, constructive engagements. This was preceded by a thorough  workshop
on  budgeting  in  government  with  unions,  designed   to   expedite   the
negotiations. We wanted everybody to  understand  what  was  in  the  fiscal
envelope to understand its dispersion.

Each union presented its own demand for salary increases, which ranged  from
9% to 13%. At the second stage of the negotiations, unions  tabled  what  we
referred to as consolidated proposals. These ranged from 13%  to  25%.  This
complicated the negotiation process, as the consolidated proposal was  twice
that of the original proposal.

In an attempt to find an agreement, and  after  careful  consideration,  the
Government revisited its offers on numerous occasions  to  accommodate  what
we believed were reasonable demands from  unions  during  the  negotiations.
Our final position was a considered offer that  balanced  the  pressing  and
competing demands on Government's resources, and addressed what we  believed
were some of the genuine concerns raised by unions.

On Tuesday last week, 2 October 2001, we offered unions until the  close  of
business to sign the agreement on the table.  This  offer,  at  that  point,
included revisions made by the Government around the issue of  restructuring
of the Public Service, in the hope  that  this  would  secure  an  agreement
signed by the majority of Public Service  unions.  The  Government  believes
that this was a  fair  offer  and  an  innovative  attempt  at  fostering  a
broader, integrated and multiterm agreement.

In demonstrating this commitment, we extended our deadlines from last  week.
Headlines screamed: ``Minister revises offer'', I think for the  third  time
or something like that, because we  felt  that  we  needed  to  reflect  our
willingness to negotiate in good faith.

Hence, we further accommodated proposals made by labour for changes  to  the
draft agreements. Regrettably, by yesterday,  with  the  exception  of  four
unions, the majority of unions in the Public Service  Co-ordinating  Council
did not accept the agreement that we presented. I am not going  to  go  into
the background to our constraints and challenges. I trust that members  will
look at a copy of my input which will be circulated.

In view of a more expansionary budget, as the  Government  we  thought  that
there were certain things that we would like to do,  including  hiring  more
people, giving larger increases and designing new measures  to  attract  and
retain scarce skills. This was a costly exercise, and if we look at  growing
capital spending, expanding the welfare net and paying  for  free  municipal
services, and these all being demands from the same part, I am sure we  will
all agree that it is clear that available resources are limited and we  need
to look at making trade-offs.

Trade-offs are difficult, but they need to be made in a  way  that  improves
the chance of the Government meeting its objectives with a finite amount  of
money. There are times in  public  policy  when  choices  have  to  be  made
between equally laudable objectives, and this is one of those situations.

Hiring more people will reduce the workload, and allow for an  expansion  of
the services that  the  Government  delivers.  In  keeping  with  this,  the
Government is committed to creating employment over the medium term  in  key
service delivery sectors which include education, correctional services  and
justice, health and welfare, and safety and security.
Why are we committed to increasing employment in the above  sectors?  It  is
true that there are areas in the Public Service  that  are  overstaffed  and
that there are areas that require fundamental restructuring in keeping  with
the agreements made by the Government with the public service sector  unions
at the Jobs Summit in January 2001 in Pietersburg.

In this House, we have repeatedly reflected on some  of  the  inefficiencies
in the Public Service. In  this  House,  members  reflect  on  some  of  the
inabilities in service delivery. We need to ensure that the  Government  and
unions together develop innovative tools and procedures that will deal  with
the situation to ensure the necessary fundamental transformation, and it  is
to this end that we remain committed to ensuring  a  process  that  complies
with the Public Service Co-ordinating Bargaining Council's resolution  7  of
2001. For all of us here, resolution 7  comprises  the  commitments  of  the
Jobs Summit agreement.

The envisaged process provides a framework for ensuring that the  rights  of
public servants and the need  to  retain  jobs  are  balanced  with  service
delivery  imperatives  that  emerge  across  the  Government.  The  critical
imperative is to have a fair  process,  and  to  ensure  that  all  possible
alternatives are exhausted before anyone is retrenched.

The current agreement - members should please look at  paragraph  8  of  the
agreement that we as the Government  signed  in  that  Chamber  -  it  gives
unions adequate time to negotiate with the Government on these  issues,  but
insists that in order  to  have  certainty,  all  parties  should  agree  to
arbitration in cases where no agreements are reached.

A false impression is being deliberately  created  that  the  Government  is
forcing unions to agree to retrenchments.  In  actual  fact,  the  agreement
provides for ample opportunity for negotiation and, as the last  resort,  it
proposes arbitration as a fair and final solution.

Clause 8 of the resolution reads:


  Parties agree to convene a special PSCBC meeting which  shall  remain  in
  session for an uninterrupted  period  between  16  October  2001  and  12
  December  2001  in  order  to  conclude   a   collective   agreement   on
  restructuring.

This came about in view of concerns that the Department of Labour  had,  and
we effected it in because we thought that it made good sense  to  us  to  be
able to have adequate  consultation  to  resolve  this  particular  question
through collective bargaining.

The negotiations contemplated in the clause that I mentioned are based  upon
the resolutions  contained  in  the  Public  Service  Jobs  Summit.  In  the
agreement on the table, we believe that resolution was a step in  the  right
direction to build a sense of consistency, moderation  and  balance  in  our
respective approaches.

It was to shift away from antagonistic annual  negotiations  -  five  months
this year and seven months in 1999 - to a situation  in  which  there  is  a
three-year  multiterm  agreement  that  is  in  line  with  the  Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework. No party could argue that anyone was  negotiating  in
bad faith.

Our wage offer was 8% for level 1, 7% for  levels  2  and  3  and  6,5%  for
levels 4 to 12. We were willing to put on the  table  money  that  we  would
vote on, on 30 October in the adjustments estimate appropriation,  in  order
to have a package deal - money that was  not  and  is  not  in  this  year's
budget appropriation - because we felt it  important  to  have  a  multiterm
agreement.

We felt it important to actually ensure that Public Service  workers  would,
for the next two years, know that on 1 July they would  get  increases  that
are  above  inflation:  0,5%   above  inflation  next  year  and  the   year
thereafter an additional 1%.

In addition to that, there would also  be  a  pay  progression  system  that
would be based on 1% of the wage Bill. That would improve merit  awards  for
productivity in order to be an incentive for those public servants  who  are
working hard. That pay progression system would take into  account  teachers
and educators who, at this point in time,  do  not  have  any  form  of  pay
progression. That system would come into operation as from April of 2002.

The mind boggles. Why was this agreement not  signed,  when  it  is  to  the
benefit of the bulk of Public Service workers who, at this particular  point
in time, do not have a form  of  pay  progression  that  acknowledges  their
outcome? It is amazing, but I am certain that we will find answers to  this.


I think a further issue to raise is  that  the  shift  towards  a  multiterm
agreement and the commitment to the imperatives of restructuring  will  open
the way for a more sustained interaction with our  labour  partners  on  the
critical issues of transformation and  conditions  of  service,  because  in
essence the core business of negotiators  cannot  be  simply  negotiating  a
percentage wage increase.

That  would  be  a  narrow,  economist  approach  to  the  issue   of   wage
negotiations, which have to take  into  account  the  broader  issues.  They
should  facilitate  the  strategy  of  addressing  needs  related   to   the
development needs of public servants and the shortage of critical skills  in
particular areas of the Public Service. Additionally, there  is  a  need  to
prioritise the provision of the  compulsory  health  care  package  for  all
public servants. As  the  Government  we  believe  that  we  did  everything
possible.

We did negotiate in good faith and with  integrity,  and  we  were  flexible
about the issues, as we can  see  if  we  trace  back  the  percentage  wage
increase. We started with 5%. We went to 5,5%.  We  actually  jumped  to  an
overall increase of 6,58%. We moved on the issue of not having had a  clause
in the restructuring component, in section 8, that dealt with the  need  for
consultation and negotiation on restructuring in the chamber by saying  that
we would sit for an uninterrupted period from next week until  12  December.
Now that sounds to me like flexibility.

We went further to say that from having had an  inflation-related  increase,
we would have inflation plus 0,5%. We said inflation plus 1%  for  the  year
thereafter. We also said, in order to cover both  employers  and  employees,
that if inflation was  below  4%  or  higher  than  7,5%,  we  would  reopen
negotiations on the wage increases. That sounds like flexibility to me.

I need to ask, at this point, whether there  are  winners  and  losers.  The
position taken by the majority of unions raises a number of concerns  and  I
want to say that there are no winners  in  this  current  impasse.  We  have
demonstrated  a  deep  commitment  towards  transformation   and   fostering
sustainable economic and employment growth. Central to this agreement  is  a
more strategic medium-term approach  designed  to  facilitate  planning  and
restructuring for improving service delivery.

The risks with this impasse are  manifold.  It  undermines  the  progressive
shift  towards  a  multiyear  agreement  that   will   allow   for   greater
predictability and planning of the Public  Service's  enhancement  over  the
medium term. This is a demand, a concern that  both  Government  and  labour
have had over the years. It limits the scope for a more  sustained,  dynamic
and innovative interaction with our labour partners on critical issues  that
Government believes are important, including  transformation.  The  proposed
agreement includes, as I said, an increase in salaries  and  wages  that  is
above CPIX inflation.

Given these risks, we as Government still believe  that  the  labour  unions
and we had much to gain from accepting  this  offer.  This  is  particularly
true for those sectors that have already gone through  major  restructuring,
like education.

Why should educators threaten to strike when the  restructuring  process  in
terms of realigning numbers  is  done?  Why  should  educators  threaten  to
strike when we clearly stated that  in  terms  of  restructuring,  a  sector
identified for employment creation is education? Maybe the House  will  help
me answer that question.

In the other sectors the package agreement provides a generous monetary  and
other benefits for all low-paid workers, unlike a flat  rate  of  5%  across
the board that does nothing to narrow the divide between  wages.  We  had  a
situation of 8%, 7% and 6,5%.

Does it mean that employees and members of unions  mandated  the  unions  to
take the  stands  they  did  take?  We  have  reflected  the  commitment  to
minimising the negative impacts of restructuring, but we felt that  it  gave
us an opportunity to jointly confront the much required  transformation  and
restructuring.

We cannot have a situation where people in the Public Service are digging  a
hole and filling a hole and taking a week to do it. That  is  not  improving
service delivery to the numbers of  South  Africans  that  are  entitled  to
effective  and  efficient  service  delivery  from   this   Public   Service
machinery, and we have a responsibility. We  are  committed  to  building  a
developmental state, and developmental  Public  Service  underpins  that.  A
developmental state does not come about by simple declaration  or  rhetoric.
It requires that we transform the Public Service in fundamental ways.

I just need to conclude by  saying  that  as  Cabinet  we  took  a  decision
yesterday that, in order to overcome the impasse in  which  public  servants
for the past five months had no certainty on increases, we are  implementing
the monetary side of the agreement that we initially put on the  table  when
we started negotiations at the end of May, that  is,  5%  across  the  board
plus R850, and that is because we  cannot  implement  a  package  deal.  The
package deal for the gradual increases of between 8% and 6,5% went  hand  in
hand with restructuring, with a multiterm  agreement,  pay  progression  and
our addressing scarce skills.

Our agreement signed by Government is in the chamber, but  we  have  started
the process to implement the 5% and R850. I  believe  that  the  House  will
appreciate the fact that, like Government,  unions  have  an  important  and
constructive role to play in assisting us to confront the  large  challenges
in the Public Service sector, but they need to be  strong  unions  that  are
willing to drive in a particular way and deal likewise with challenges  that
may in the short term seem to be unpopular.

It is a difficult but necessary task, and I hope the House  will  understand
our process in this regard. I want to express thanks to all  those  who  are
walking this road with us. [Applause.]

Ms C S BOTHA: Chairperson, the hon the  Minister  is  always  so  articulate
that one is almost tempted to feel sorry for her, but, seeing  as  I  do  in
the papers that the unions have come off second best, I think I should  keep
my sympathies for them.

The hon the Minister and the unions, or, as she  calls  them,  her  ``labour
partners'', remind me very much of two  people  trying  to  learn  to  dance
together; one step forward, two steps back and  in  the  process  a  lot  of
injured toes and, it seems, injured children if  the  teachers'  unions  are
going to strike. Striking  over  wage  increases  tends  to  show  that  one
partner wears jackboots to the dance floor.

This whole wage negotiation saga leaves one with a  sense  of  déjà  vu.  We
annually go through this painful process for months, only to find  that  the
discordant noise is not harmonised and that the  whole  process  will  start
again. One wonders why they do not get it right.

One of the problems seems to be that the unions want to sing from  one  song
sheet only, called collective bargaining, while the  Minister  has  her  own
solo, sometimes restructuring, sometimes no package deal.

Collective bargaining has the appeal of simplicity and gives the  appearance
of uniformity of principle and intent, ``'n soort van eendrag maak mag''  [a
kind of unity is strength''], and therefore deceptive strength,  but  it  is
actually a crude method of dealing with the divergent needs probably at  the
base of the problems that we face now.

It gives power to the negotiators but it takes power away  from  the  people
whose interests should be served. There  is  a  simple  answer  to  Minister
Fraser-Moleketi's dilemma: Get rid of the Public  Service  as  a  homogenous
entity.  Collective  bargaining  in  the  Public  Service  is  obviously   a
stumbling block and these broadband adjustments of wages are inappropriate.

Last week the Minister warned civil servants and said that they would get  a
pay rise of only 5% if the majority of unions did not accept  her  offer  of
between 6,5% and 8%. This has now happened. It is clear that some wanted  to
settle for her offer, so why are they being  sacrificed  to  the  collective
chorus?

The core issue is that public servants must be paid what they are worth  and
the public must get the service it deserves. Let us hope that  the  Minister
is eventually going to get it right. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I have to say that I agree with  everything  the
Minister said and I have to congratulate her on her courage  and  fortitude.
That is not to say that I do not think that the  Government  have  not  been
patient; I think they have been patient.

The negotiations were long and protracted. The unions are  lucky  that  they
have a sympathetic and receptive Government that listen  to  them,  but  the
Government must also draw the line somewhere.

The fact is, short-termism is the worst  possible  approach  the  Government
could adopt now.  Unless  we  defer  consumption,  and  unless  we  actually
develop the state, we will be arguing about less and less as we go  forward.
In my opinion, after the long and comprehensive discussions, any  reasonable
person would think that  the  offer  Government  have  on  the  table  is  a
reasonable one. I am sure that business supports it. I am not  sure  whether
the Minister would like to hear that, but nevertheless it is true.

I know that the Government is doing its  best  and,  in  some  respects,  is
doing extremely  well.  There  might  be  a  few  consumers  of  the  Public
Service's service that think that there have been dramatic  improvements  in
the services. We see poor service delivery all over the place. We know  that
it is being addressed and we can see improvements, but it  is  a  long  haul
and it is  part  of  the  whole  developmental  picture  that  the  Minister
sketched for us.

When one looks at the package as such - the notches, the 13th  cheques,  the
14th cheques, the merit awards and the other things which go with it  -  our
civil service is well off, in the circumstances.

The large number of unemployed people who  are  neither  part  of  organised
labour nor in the civil service will have  the  greatest  sympathy  for  the
Minister's position.  These  people  know  that  if  the  Minister  and  the
President do not take a tough line,  they  will  be  squeezed  out,  because
those resources would then not be directed to the needs of the  really  poor
and disadvantaged in our country.

The Minister said there are no winners. I think there are  winners.  If  the
Government wins this round, then South Africa will be a winner, and I  think
the unions also. The unions have to be more responsible.

The other day I was in Port Elizabeth and I saw that  the  Mentone  clothing
factory - all of us have worn Mentone clothes at some stage in our  lives  -
was closing down. It was started in 1940.  Five  hundred  people  have  lost
their jobs. These things are finely balanced.

The embattled company was on the verge of a turnaround, but for  a  nine-day
strike. According to a spokesman, the company was, in  July  2001,  affected
by industrial action and go-slows, thus  losing  nine  days  of  production.
What happened at the end of it all?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Order!

Mr K D S DURR: What happened was that 500 people lost their jobs.

I want to congratulate the hon the Minister on a job well done. She has  our
support. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Could I remind members that  when  I  do
call on them to indicate that their  time  has  expired,  they  should  stop
speaking. It would allow the proceedings to continue in an orderly way.

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members of this Council,  we
hail from a past of homelands  and  apartheid  systems.  The  weaknesses  of
which systems have repeatedly been articulated  in  this  Council.  We  also
hail from a past of tricameral parliaments, the weaknesses of which  systems
have not often been articulated.
During those eras, things were done for and not  in  consultation  with  the
concerned groups. The operative words were ``It is  good  enough  for  them.
Dit is goed genoeg vir hulle. E ba lekane.''

The Minister's statement this afternoon serves to prove how the present  era
differs from those of the past where we come from. We  are  not  only  being
called, but we are in fact being begged, to come to  the  negotiating  table
and to continue the negotiation process regarding basic issues  that  affect
our lives.

However,  the  unions  are  cautious  and  noncommittal.  They  suspect,  or
believe, that there is a built-in clause for restructuring in the  agreement
dealing with the restructuring  measures.  They  are  quick  to  flex  their
muscles and threaten to go on strike on the eve of the  examination.  It  is
unacceptable to resort to threats and blackmail of this nature.

The deadline has expired, but one needs to appeal to  all  parties  involved
in this issue to let reason prevail and work towards building  mutual  trust
between the two negotiating parties. The Government, for  its  part,  should
continue to woo the unions in  order  to  reach  consensus  in  the  future.
[Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, hon Minister and colleagues,  the  ANC  notes
that the Public  Service  is  still  in  a  transformation  stage  and  thus
tensions  are  likely  to  occur,  especially  when  dealing  with   matters
concerning service conditions. We further note that  the  deliberations  are
not a straightforward case, and that the performance  of  the  Ministry  and
Government was well considered under the circumstances.

We  further  believe  that  the  public  servant  of  the  21st  century  is
critically conscious of Government's responsibility to the greater  society,
and not only to public service. The ANC, therefore,  supports  the  Minister
and  Government  for  its  innovative  and  consultative  approach  to   the
negotiations. The ANC is satisfied that a fair  and  equitable  balance  has
been achieved in terms of its proposal  of  the  limited  resources  of  the
state and the increased remuneration and terms of conditions of  the  Public
Service sector.

We are convinced of  the  good  faith  of  Government  in  the  arduous  and
protracted negotiations, and in the  approach  the  negotiations  have  been
taking. In addition, we are also appreciative of  the  integrative  approach
to  enhancing  employment.  The  increment  is  also  reasonable  and  above
inflation. We also know that these offers have been very generous under  the
circumstances.

 To respond to some noises from the other side, we wish  to  note  that  the
Public Service is not treated as a  homogenous  entity,  and  therefore  the
agreement  refers  to  detailed  negotiations  with  the   various   sectors
represented in the chamber. We should also note that  collective  bargaining
requires a majority signature for its implementation of those packages  that
have been offered in the negotiating chamber. We are utterly confident  that
the ANC as Government will never be found  wanting  in  a  process  that  it
pioneered from the start. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

   PUBLIC WORKS AND INFRASTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT: A TOOL TO ADDRESS POVERTY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Chairperson and hon members, I must  say  that
I am really happy that this topic has been suggested by  the  NCOP  for  the
simple reason  that,  at  times,  people  know  that  there  are  Government
programmes, but cannot really say  what  these  programmes  are  all  about.
Also, in a number of  statements  that  have  been  made  at  the  level  of
Government, we actually put the question of poverty, not only  as  an  issue
that is there, but as an issue that we as the people of  South  Africa  need
to eradicate.  And,  as  Government,  too,  we  have  set  up  an  ambitious
programme through which, as a collective of departments, we  hope  to  do  a
fair amount in the eradication of poverty.

If one looks at the programme as we have it  in  the  Department  of  Public
Works, it was actually started as a specific job  creation  exercise,  which
targeted a number of rural areas. The aim of this was to  create  short-term
employment opportunities wherein members of the  various  communities  could
construct public assets. Later on it was felt that the important  thing  was
not just the construction of these assets, but also ensuring that they  were
sustainable in nature.

When we deal with these projects, we emphasise that local labour  should  be
used. At least 30% of the labour from the  projects  should  come  from  the
local people. We also emphasise that women should be employed,  and  we  put
the figure at 50%. We also  say  that  15%  of  youth  should  be  employed,
especially because a number  of  them  have  left  school  and  cannot  find
employment, and that consideration of 1,5%  should  also  be  given  to  the
disabled.

Since its inception in 1994-95, the programme has actually undergone  a  lot
of changes and improvements. We do want to believe that  in  order  for  hon
members to understand, we have to give them a little background.  Those  who
were here will remember that 1994 to 1996 was regarded as the pilot  project
phase. During this phase we had  the  RDP,  and  from  the  RDP  funds  R250
million was allocated for these projects, which  are  community-based.  They
were the ones that started the pilot projects.

Initially, the implementing agents were the various  provincial  departments
of public works. We also initially made sure that  some  of  the  NGOs  were
involved, and that IDT, in terms of which we have the Ministry  is  entitled
to the shareholding, was also involved. At the time a number of  the  people
queried why IDT was involved,  but  the  logical  answer  was  that  it  had
already been involved in the building of schools in a  number  of  areas  in
the country.

Thereafter we graduated from that pilot project phase to the  1996  to  1999
phase, wherein we felt that  there  was  a  need  to  realign  the  projects
themselves. First of all, we had an evaluation exercise carried out by  what
is known as the Community Agency for Social  Enquiry,  that  is,  Case,  and
also by the International Labour Organisation, known  as  the  ILO.  If  hon
members remember, Public Works then got the award  for  being  the  best-run
exercise in Southern Africa.

This evaluation, which was undertaken, actually indicated that we needed  to
realign the strategic direction of the programme so that it  could  be  more
focused. Then we had to make some institutional arrangements and  make  sure
that the  focus  was  more  on  sustainability.  This  is  because  one  can
understand that when one builds a  structure  today,  people  get  temporary
jobs, but thereafter there are no sustainable jobs.

The issues that were dealt with then were put through  what  we  called  the
preimplenting task team, which was given the mandate to plan  and  implement
future programmes. What we realised was that one of the outcomes  from  such
an exercise had to do with targeting. The recommendation there was that  the
focus be on rural women and youth, that a balance be created in those  areas
with poverty pockets and that  if  we  were  talking  about  development  of
areas, we should actually have economic nodes in those areas.

We also realised that development  cannot  be  treated  like  a  gumtree.  A
gumtree grows up on its own. The important  thing  was  that  we  needed  to
cluster our projects and make sure  that  they  talked  to  each  other  for
effectiveness, because if hon members will remember, as the  President  said
the other day, a clinic would be built, while there will be no road  leading
to it and no water for the clinic. But, the clustering has led to  different
Ministries coming together and  providing  an  effective  service.  It  also
became important that there should be a monitoring of  the  projects,  which
we asked the provincial departments of Public Works to co-ordinate.

I am sure that hon members are exposed to some  of  the  work  that  we  are
doing in their areas. One of the  problems  we  have  is  that,  apart  from
dealing  directly  with  poverty,  for  example  agricultural  projects  and
community gardens, we also have to deal with issues around social cohesion.
How many times have we had people in rural areas not even  having  a  decent
hall in which to have meetings? Even  if  halls  are  there,  there  are  no
kitchen or toilet facilities. And we felt that if we wanted to give  dignity
to a people, we also had to give them facilities that had a  social  impact.
Hence, the start of the multipurpose halls that  we  have  in  a  number  of
areas. Because  these  areas  were  rural,  it  became  important  that  the
implementing agent should change,  as  I  have  said,  from  the  provincial
departments  to  local  government  authorities,  so   that   the   district
municipalities themselves could have the  overall  programme  management  of
what we were doing, could be involved in  training  in  various  communities
and be able to point out the local contractors to be  used  so  that  people
could  be  trained  to  make  sure  that  the   projects   themselves   were
sustainable. And, of course, the budget which  covers  project  funding  and
support services came from the Department of Public Works itself.

I have said that this meant that there was  a  role  change  from  what  the
provinces were doing by allowing the municipalities to be  the  implementing
agents. All that the provinces had to do independently  was  to  co-ordinate
and monitor what was happening in these projects, something  that  was  done
very well in some of the provinces, but we still have a  few  problems  with
monitoring.

Through this monitoring, we want to capture and  evaluate  whether  we  have
programmes for programmes' sake and whether  they  have  an  impact  on  the
people. This reminds me of when I was a teacher, and a question was  put  to
Unicef: Was it going to have education for education's sake or the  type  of
education that would help  the  country  to  grow,  gain  skills,  etc?  The
approach that we have followed with the projects is to make sure that  there
is an  impact  and  difference  to  the  lives  of  the  people  within  the
community.

We have some technical names for some of the  techniques  that  we  use  for
monitoring. Since hon members are going to get copies of the speech,  and  I
am looking at the time factor, I will not be going  too  deeply  into  that.
But one of the programmes and the systems that we are using  for  monitoring
is called the management and information systems or MMIS.  This  system  has
been developed over the last two years and contains all the key  performance
indicators for successful implementation.

According to the monitoring and  evaluation  unit  in  the  Presidency,  the
programme that we are dealing with, as Public Works,  is  one  of  only  two
programmes with a successful monitoring system. I am  not  trying  to  boast
but I am stating a fact.

We also felt that we had to really align this  programme  because  life  has
changed a lot and still changes even in South Africa, and we called  it  the
new dimensions phase. This phase actually refers to the development  of  the
Community-Based Public Works project, wherein we  try  and  make  sure  that
there is capacity, especially amongst the people who deal with some  of  our
projects, so that they are able to deal with specific imperatives, and  also
make sure that we forge partnerships and  co-ordination  with  a  number  of
stakeholders so that the projects themselves are successful. The reason  for
that, as I said, is that if one is not a  gumtree  in  a  project,  one  can
actually make the most impact. That is why, when Government  introduced  the
Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Strategy, we felt that we had  done
part of the walking into the realisation of that strategy because of the  30
nodes, as pointed out by Government. We already have  programmes  in  11  of
those nodes.

 I want hon members  to  realise  that  in  any  government  situation,  the
creation of capacity is necessary because it  is  what  makes  or  breaks  a
project. Even in the day-to-day running of our  individual  departments,  if
capacity is not  of  the  right  type,  for  example  if  Public  Works  has
engineers who just do a 9:00 to 4:30 job but do not go out  into  the  field
and make sure that things happen, we will not have a department that  is  on
the move.

My director-general, who is here with us today, coined a new  name  for  how
we approach work and called it ``working smarter''. Some  of  these  changes
that we are making are to actually say that we want to work  smarter.  I  am
deviating because if hon members had asked me to speak about  Public  Works,
I would have had to tell them some of these things. I  am  halfway  through.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon Minister, I think that you are  very
correct in saying that we must invite you more often. I  am  sure  that  the
members would agree with that.

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, I believe that our role in Government is to  look
critically at how we  implement  the  principles  of  transformation,  which
begins to give back to our impoverished  communities  both  that  which  was
forcibly removed from them and that which they were denied.

Currently in South  Africa  there  is  no  end  to  what  can  be  repaired,
replaced, reconstructed or  developed  to  ensure  that  the  lives  of  our
parents and colleagues are dramatically improved.  Indeed,  showing  visible
improvement in the lives of our people becomes the yardstick  against  which
everything we do is measured.

We believe that the Department of Public Works is  a  strategic  role-player
in assisting all other departments in  achieving  this  collective  goal  of
quality delivery and improvement in conditions.

Kafishane, sizama ukuthi kucace  kuthi  bha  ukuthi  umnyango  kaNgqongqoshe
yiwona ongumgogodla wayo yonke eminye iminyango. Uma umnyango  kaNgqongqoshe
ubukeka sengathi unezikhinsi  noma  izigodi,  kuyokwenza  ukuthi  kube  lula
ukuthi  yonke  eminye  iminyango  kahulumeni  ikhalakathele  lapho  phakathi
ngenxa yezikhinsi ezingadalwa umnyango - angithi  owethu  angingasho  ukuthi
okamhlonishwa. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[In short, we are trying to clarify that the department of the  Minister  is
the backbone of all other departments. If there is a hole in it, it will  be
easy for other departments to fall into that hole. In fact I should say  our
department, not the department of the Minister.]
By way of illustration, I want to share with members that a  few  weeks  ago
the Select Committee on Social Services demonstrated how  vital  this  close
interrelationship between sectors was.  The  committee  was  exploring  what
factors were directly or indirectly interfering with the processing  of  new
applications  for  child  support  grants  in  the  Western  Cape,   thereby
preventing needy mothers from gaining access to this much-needed grant.

Three departments, that is Social  Development,  Health  and  Home  Affairs,
were invited to this meeting to demonstrate what  each  of  the  departments
was doing to facilitate the smooth application and processing of  the  birth
registration, followed by the grant application process.

What became apparent during the interaction was  the  fact  that  all  these
departments needed access  to  adequate  facilities  within  easy  reach  of
communities. These kinds of facilities, as is  the  case  with  most  state-
owned property, fall directly within the jurisdiction of the  Department  of
Public Works. The Department of Public Works held the key to access.

Each  of  the  departments  present,  when  questioned  by  the   committee,
complained in turn that they did not have  adequate  offices  close  to  the
people in order to  provide  easy  access  to  these  much-needed  services.
Unfortunately the Department of Public Works  was  not  present  to  explain
their role and what went wrong within their department in the  provision  of
the vital childcare grant application service. But,  clearly,  the  lack  of
adequate  facilities  for  whatever  reason  led  to  unnecessary  hardship,
forcing desperate mothers and children to starve when government  money  was
available. All that was  needed  to  complete  the  process  was  access  to
facilities and people who cared.

Another example of the challenges facing the Department of Public Works  and
their capacity to deliver infrastructural development was demonstrated  when
the NCOP Select Committee on Public  Works  went  to  the  Eastern  Cape  to
assess the aftermath of the floods, which happened earlier this year.

The committee  had  expected  to  see  how  all  the  affected  departments,
including  the  Department  of  Public  Works,  were  advancing   in   their
endeavours to rebuild communities after such a  terrible  natural  disaster.
What we found were freshly appointed cleanup crews that had only just  begun
to clear the destruction and to add insult  to  injury,  the  cleanup  crews
informed the  committee  members  that  the  cleanup  had  begun  because  a
committee from Parliament was coming in order to hold an inspection.

Clearly, these kinds of responses to our people's needs were  not  what  the
Minister  meant  when  she  launched  her  ``work   smart''   transformation
programme and our Community-Based Public  Works  Programme.  Both  of  these
programmes place an emphasis on strong work ethics. In  fact,  the  Minister
told us that she had given a brand new name to  the  programme,  which  is``
Letsima'' or`` Ilima''. We all know that  this  embraces  the  African  work
ethic of doing things together.

We know that those 981 community projects that the department helped to  get
off the ground last year and the 22 619 people that  the  department  helped
get jobs, as mentioned in the Minister's Budget  debate  speech  this  year,
represent only the tip of  the  iceberg  with  regard  to  delivery  to  the
people. We know of  the  noble  efforts  made  by  the  transformation-based
policies that the department is currently engaged in,  and  we  commend  the
Minister and her department for all her efforts. But we would be failing  in
our duty as public representatives if we did not  outline  to  the  Minister
tangible  proof  of  the  failure  of  the  transformation  policy  at   its
implementation stage.

I personally bear testimony to the absolute waste of  government  facilities
in my province of KwaZulu-Natal. On the route to my constituency  there  are
a number of examples of newly built multipurpose centres, clinics and  other
facilities that are locked up to the public or that stand in the  middle  of
nowhere as white elephants, because Public Works and other  departments  did
not consult with each other before construction began. This is an  untenable
situation.

Noma-ke  mhlonishwa  ngingeke   ngiqiniseke   ukuthi   iphutha   singalibeka
kuHulumeni omkhulu noma  kuhulumeni  wesifunda  kodwa  nje  besifuna  ukuthi
amehlo   kaNgqongqoshe   siwadonsele   ngakulolu   hlelo   lokwenza   izinto
emnyangweni wakhe. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[Hon member, although I am sure we can blame the national Government or  the
provincial government, however, we would like to draw the attention  of  the
Minister to the plan of working in his department.]

In our democracy today, we have to be vigilant  in  our  plans  of  bringing
about change in our communities. This is especially  true  after  the  local
government elections. The new animal, local government, must  not  make  the
same mistakes we did nationally and  provincially.  Unless  all  spheres  of
government, all departments and all representatives of civil  societies  sit
down together and create  consolidated  IDP  plans,  we  are  in  danger  of
duplicating all the expensive lessons learnt in the past.

Intergovernmental co-operation  and  intersectoral  support  must  become  a
mantra before each of  the  spheres  of  government  begins  to  tackle  new
projects.  All  priorities  should  become  aligned,  so   that   collective
resources can work in tandem towards the common good of improving the  lives
of our people.

Siyacabanga ukuthi umhlonishwa angeke ayithathe  le  nkulumo  njengohlaselo,
siyamqwashisa   ngoba   siyabona   ukuthi    uma    singamqwashisi    ngathi
sizokonakalelwa. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[We think that the hon member will not take this  speech  as  an  attack  on
him. We would like to warn him, because if we do not do  that,  things  will
not go well. [Applause.]]

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, dit is in belang van die land dat  ons  vandag  in
hierdie Huis debat voer oor die prestasies, al dan nie, van die  Departement
van Openbare Werke, na aanleiding  van  'n  verslag  wat  opgestel  is  deur
Kgoshi Mokoena ná 'n  afvaardiging  van  die  Gekose  Komitee  oor  Openbare
Dienste die Oos-Kaap besoek het.

Vandag wil ek net kortliks na die bogenoemde verslag verwys deur te  sê  dat
dit wat daarin staan, absoluut skokkend is. Dit  getuig  deurgaans  van  die
onvermoë  van  die  Departement  van  Openbare  Werke  om   lewensbelangrike
infrastruktuur soos paaie en staatsgeboue, byvoorbeeld hospitale  en  skole,
in stand te hou, asook die versuim om deeglik toesig te hou oor dít wat  die
Departement van Openbare Werke, Paaie en Vervoer in die  bepaalde  provinsie
probeer doen met die minimale  fondse  tot  hul  beskikking.  Dit  blyk  ook
duidelik uit die verslag dat die Departement van Openbare Werke  nie  daarin
kon slaag om die krisis wat ontstaan het, as gevolg van skade aangerig  deur
erge vloede sedert 1998, die hoof te bied nie.

Genadiglik was die Vrystaat nie so erg geteister deur  vloedskade  nie.  Dit
beteken egter nie dat  die  infrastruktuur,  veral  die  padnetwerk  in  die
Vrystaat, nie agteruitgegaan het die afgelope jare nie. Inteendeel, dit  het
met rasse skrede agteruitgegaan, soveel só dat die LUR nou bekend  staan  as
die minister van slaggate. Die  hoofoorsaak  vir  hierdie  agteruitgang  was
deurgaans deur die agb LUR vir Openbare Werke, Paaie en Vervoer aangegee  as
'n tekort aan fondse vir instandhouding. Dieselfde  LUR  het  egter  onlangs
aangekondig  dat  méér  geld  nou  hopelik   vir   padkonstruksie   en   die
instandhouding daarvan beskikbaar gaan wees, weens die feit dat die agb  LUR
die nasionale departement, volgens hom, kon oorreed  om  die  instandhouding
van sekere provinsiale paaie oor te neem.

Dáárvoor wil my party die agb LUR komplimenteer. Ons wil  ook  ons  dank  en
waardering teenoor hom uitspreek, veral omdat die SA Nasionale  Padagentskap
nou verantwoordelikheid aanvaar vir die meeste deurpaaie. Dit is goed,  want
die ergste skade aan hierdie paaie  word  aangerig  deur  swaarvoertuie  van
ander provinsies wat deur die Vrystaat ry.

Die genoemde blydskap het egter vervaag nadat ek 'n  persberig,  betreffende
die  Ouditeur-Generaal  se  verslag  oor  die  Vrystaatse  Departement   van
Openbare Werke, Paaie en Vervoer, gelees het. Ek haal aan uit Die  Volksblad
van 1 Oktober 2001:


  Stawende bewyse vir uitgawes van miljoene rande deur die Departement  van
  Openbare Werke, Paaie en Vervoer van die Vrystaat kon nie  voorgelê  word
  nie. Die verhaalbaarheid van agterstallige skuld van miljoene  rande  aan
  dié departement is twyfelagtig. Dié departement met al sy staatsbates het
  nie 'n volledige lys van verhuurbare eiendomme nie - sy huurinkomste  kan
  dus nie gestaaf word nie.


  Die staatsgarage self kon in 2000 nie 'n volledige lys  of  register  van
  voertuie voorlê nie. Vroeër vanjaar kon 'n verskil van sowat R26  miljoen
  tussen inskrywings in die vastebateregister en die algemene grootboek nie
  verduidelik word nie.

Weens  die  aard  en  die  omvang  van   die   ernstige   tekortkominge   en
onreëlmatighede in die geldsake van die Vrystaatse Departement van  Openbare
Werke, Paaie en Vervoer, het die Ouditeur-Generaal homself  daarvan  weerhou
om 'n mening uit te spreek. Dit is ontstellend! Ek kan u  verseker  dat  die
aanhaling wat ek gelees het maar net die punt van die  ysberg  is.  Daar  is
nog vele meer bevindinge in die verslag wat jou hart wil laat staan.

Ek sê hierdie verslag is onstellend, want al  beweer  die  agb  LUR  in  die
Vrystaat dat daar nou meer geld beskikbaar gaan wees, wonder 'n  mens  egter
of hierdie fondse nie maar weer net op dieselfde wyse vermors en  verduister
gaan word nie. My party is veral bekommerd oor die feit dat, in 'n  antwoord
op 'n vraag aan hierdie LUR gestel,  ons  verneem  het  dat  die  Vrystaatse
padnetwerk, bestaande uit 7000 km teerpaaie, 21 500  km  gruispaaie,  en  22
000 km tersiëre paaie, in 'n swak toestand is.

Betreffende die primêre paaie, is 12% in 'n uiters swak toestand, 32% in  'n
swak toestand, 35%  in  'n  redelike  toestand,  en  net  20%  in  'n  goeie
toestand. Betreffende gruispaaie in die platteland, is 20% in 'n  baie  swak
toestand, 33% in 'n swak toestand, 23% in 'n redelike toestand, en  net  14%
in 'n goeie toestand. Volgens die  agb  LUR  is  daar  'n  tekort  aan  R1,7
miljard net vir die hergruis van gruispaaie en die herseël van teerpaaie.

Dit is dus nodig dat elke beskikbare sent op die regte wyse aangewend  word.
As ons nie ons infrastruktuur onderhou nie, gaan ons ekonomie  skade  ly  en
gaan armoede net vererger. Ek hoop dat die Departement  van  Openbare  Werke
nie net uit die foute van die verlede geleer het hoe om nuwe foute  te  maak
nie. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, it is in the interests of the  country  that  we
debate in this House today the achievements, or not, of  the  Department  of
Public  Works,  following  a  report  drafted  by  Chief  Mokoena  after   a
delegation from the Select Committee on Public Services visited the  Eastern
Cape.

Today I want to refer only briefly to the aforementioned  report  by  saying
that what is  contained  in  it  is  absolutely  shocking.  It  consistently
attests to the inability of the  Department  of  Public  Works  to  maintain
essential infrastructure,  such  as  roads  and  Government  buildings,  for
example hospitals  and  schools,  as  well  as  the  failure  to  thoroughly
supervise that which the department of public works,  roads  and  transport,
in the province in question tries to  do  with  the  minimal  funds  at  its
disposal. It is also clear from the report that  the  Department  of  Public
Works could not succeed in solving the crisis which arose  as  a  result  of
damage caused by serious flooding since 1998.

Mercifully, the Free State was not so seriously  ravaged  by  flood  damage.
However, this does not mean that the infrastructure, particularly  the  road
network in the Free State, has not deteriorated in the past  years.  On  the
contrary, it has deteriorated with rapid strides, so much so  that  the  MEC
is now known as the minister  of  potholes.  The  primary  reason  for  this
deterioration was consistently given by the hon MEC for public works,  roads
and transport, as a shortage of funds for  maintenance.  However,  the  same
MEC recently announced that more money will now hopefully be  available  for
road construction and maintenance, as a result of  the  fact  that  the  hon
MEC, according to him, was able to convince the national department to  take
over the maintenance of certain provincial roads.

My party would like to compliment the hon MEC  on  that.  We  also  want  to
express our thanks and appreciation towards him,  particularly  because  the
SA National Roads Agency has now accepted responsibility  for  most  through
roads. This is good, because the most  serious  damage  to  these  roads  is
caused by heavy vehicles from other provinces which drive through  the  Free
State.

However, the aforementioned joy faded after I read a news  report  regarding
the Auditor-General's report on the Free State department of  public  works,
roads and transport. I quote from Die Volksblad of 1 October 2001:


  Stawende bewyse vir uitgawes van miljoene rande deur die Departement  van
  Openbare Werke, Paaie en Vervoer van die Vrystaat kon nie  voorgelê  word
  nie. Die verhaalbaarheid van agterstallige skuld van miljoene  rande  aan
  dié departement is twyfelagtig. Dié departement met al sy staatsbates het
  nie 'n volledige lys van verhuurbare eiendomme nie - sy huurinkomste  kan
  dus nie gestaaf word nie.


  Die staatsgarage self kon in 2000 nie 'n volledige lys  of  register  van
  voertuie voorlê nie. Vroeër vanjaar kon 'n verskil van sowat R26  miljoen
  tussen inskrywings in die vastebateregister en die algemene grootboek nie
  verduidelik word nie.

As a result of the  nature  and  extent  of  the  serious  shortcomings  and
irregularities in the financial matters of the department of  public  works,
roads and  transport,  the  Auditor-General  refrained  from  expressing  an
opinion. This is upsetting! I can assure you  that  the  quotation  which  I
read is merely the tip of the iceberg. There are many more findings  in  the
report which will make your heart miss a beat.

I say that this report is upsetting, because although the  hon  MEC  in  the
Free State alleges that more  money  will  now  be  available,  one  wonders
whether these funds are not simply going to be wasted and embezzled  in  the
same way. My party is particularly concerned  about  the  fact  that,  in  a
reply to a question put to this MEC, we learnt  that  the  Free  State  road
network, consisting of 7 000 kilometres  of  tarred  roads,  21  500  km  of
gravel roads and 22 000 km of tertiary roads, is in a poor condition.

Regarding the primary roads, 12% are in an extremely poor condition, 32%  in
a poor condition, 35% in a reasonable condition, and  only  20%  in  a  good
condition. Regarding gravel roads in the rural areas,  20%  are  in  a  very
poor condition, 33% in a poor condition, 23% in a reasonable  condition  and
only 14% in a good condition. According to the hon MEC there is  a  shortage
of R1,7 billion for the regravelling of gravel roads and  the  resealing  of
tarred roads alone.

It is therefore necessary that every  available  cent  be  utilised  in  the
right way. If we do not maintain our infrastructure our economy is going  to
suffer and poverty will simply worsen. I hope that the Department of  Public
Works has not merely learnt from the mistakes of the past how  to  make  new
mistakes. [Applause.]]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA:  Chairperson,  on  26  February  this  year  the  Select
Committee on Public Service undertook a study tour to the Eastern Cape.  The
main aim of this visit was to find out  how  poverty-alleviation  programmes
were functioning. We also wanted to see the condition of roads in that  part
of the country.

Poverty is widely acknowledged as one of the serious problems  facing  post-
apartheid South Africa. This department is right at the centre  of  some  of
these programmes, hence  it  is  through  it  that  the  Government  intends
flushing poverty out of our people's lives.

A recent study has shown that close to 70% of South Africa's  rural  people,
of whom a larger majority are blacks, are poverty-stricken.  Poverty  has  a
significant gender characteristic. The poverty  rate  amongst  female-headed
households was 60% in 1995, considerably higher than the 31% in  male-headed
households.

The Government could not take this scenario  very  lightly.  The  Government
decided to confront this situation head-on and came up with a plan. For  any
plan to be implemented, one needs proper  supervision  and  monitoring.  For
example, the national department has come up with some  plans  to  construct
roads in order to create jobs for our people.

Let us take the Eastern Cape, for example. During our visit we  went  to  an
area called Qhoboshianeng, where a bridge was  being  constructed,  with  40
women employed there. Unfortunately, as I am speaking now,  they  have  been
told to pack and go because there are insufficient funds  to  continue  with
the construction. The families of  those  40  women  are  now  beggars,  not
knowing where their next slice of brown bread will come from.

The committee also visited Spundu access  road  in  Mount  Ayliff,  that  is
roads T110 and T109. The two projects were aimed at creating  jobs  for  our
people. Unfortunately, as I am speaking to hon members, those projects  have
been stopped.

The committee was not impressed with the condition of  some  of  the  roads,
for example road T115 from Mount Frere to  Mount  Fletcher,  and  road  T100
from Mount Frere to Lugangeni. I know I am talking  about  the  areas  which
the hon the Minister knows very well.

Roads such as T69 from Maluti to the  Lesotho  border,  connecting  Mpotseng
village, road T77 in Mount Frere and road 56 to Lekgatlana are not  in  good
condition. However, we were impressed because  officials  in  that  province
informed us that something will  be  done  to  make  sure  that  people  are
employed to work on those roads, local people  that  is.  Unfortunately  the
condition of those roads was very, very bad. We could not  believe  what  we
saw at Thabachicha.

We were  reliably  informed  that  the  roads  were  last  graded  in  1986.
Officials from that province confirmed this information.  For  example,  the
committee took an hour travelling between roads T77 and T74, simply  because
there was no road to speak of. It was just  dongas.  The  problem  lies  not
with the national department,  but  with  the  provincial  department.  Why?
There is no supervision or monitoring.

Yes, it is true, we find all  those  problems  mostly  in  roads  which  are
manned by provinces. In one camp a grader was parked  beside  the  road  for
almost three months because of a flat tire.

We discovered that at Mzimvubu District Council, some  officials  said  that
it was normal for a grader to be parked for even two months,  because  there
were no funds to put in the diesel. When  we  enquired  as  to  whether  the
national department was aware of this,  they  said  that  one  official  was
mandated to phone the department - not to write  a  letter  to  it,  but  to
phone it.

At the Umzimkhulu District Council,  at  Embuzweni  village,  we  discovered
something very strange. There was this construction company,  which  was  to
repair the slates at the R56. The two slates in question were badly done  by
the same construction company. The road cracked  and  the  gravel  road  was
washed away or  went  flat.  The  provincial  department  rehired  the  same
company to re-do the job for an extra, additional fee. I do  not  know  what
to call this.

At one camp, workers unashamedly informed us that they were clocking  in  at
12:00 and knocking off at 15:30. They were so surprised when  we  questioned
that arrangement. They could not even  understand  why  we  queried  one  of
their workers coming to work ``poep'' drunk. [Interjections.] The  cause  of
all this ... [Laughter.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Madam Chair, on a point of order, and for  the  sake  of
the  dignity  of  this  House:  The  expression  ``poep   drunk''   is   not
parliamentary. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! You are raising a  point  of  order.  Mr
Mokoena, could you just make sure that your language  is  parliamentary?  In
the past we have made reference to us needing to  use  appropriate  language
and terminology in the House.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I want to thank you for your ruling, and  I
want to thank my loyal subject for advising me. [Laughter.]

As I said, the cause of all this is  lack  of  supervision  and  monitoring.
What we saw was, `Everybody for himself, but God  for  us  all.''  They  are
just like those people who are not ashamed to hand out their business  cards
at funerals, or see nothing wrong in putting salt in a sugar container.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I am afraid your time has expired.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Oh, my God! [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chair, hon Minister, hon colleagues, the reduction  of  poverty
and inequality remains the objective of not only  the  Government,  but  all
South Africans. Access to quality employment  is  critical  to  achieving  a
sustainable livelihood. It is almost  trite  to  say  that  high  levels  of
poverty prevail in rural areas, especially among  the  agricultural  workers
who seem to be the worst hit.

In this context, unemployment is  certainly  a  significant  contributor  to
poverty. One of the many ways to address the  unemployment  situation  would
be to establish community-based public works programmes,  and  the  hon  the
Minister, in her introductory remarks, spoke at  length  about  these  local
community-based programmes that the department is engaged in.

There is no doubt that these programmes, if properly handled,  play  a  very
important role in  the  delivery  of  services  and  infrastructure  to  the
disadvantaged communities. It is the disadvantaged communities that seem  to
bear the brunt of inadequate or poor roads, or  inadequate  facilities  such
as clinics, schools and community halls.

Once upon a time the main barrier to entry into the labour  market  in  this
country was direct discrimination on the basis of race  and  gender.  Today,
of course, nondiscriminatory labour practices are par for the course.

I wish to point out that, though poverty in South Africa is not confined  to
one race only, the unpalatable fact that we must face  is  that  poverty  is
mainly concentrated among black South Africans. It is  estimated  that  over
60% of Africans are in the poverty trap.

My friend Kgoshi Mokoena, on the other  hand,  spoke  at  length  about  the
importance of roads as access to communities. He  painted  a  rather  dreary
picture of the poor condition in which some of the roads are, especially  in
rural areas.

We cannot deny that if a community has been isolated  and  almost  forgotten
because of bad roads, or lack of access to roads,  then  that  community  is
denied empowerment. In my view, having useful roads to communities that  are
isolated and away from the developed areas is important, because that  gives
them empowerment.

I do not have to go and sketch a picture about how our old people, and  even
young school children,  in  some  cases,  have  to  travel  long  distances,
through dongas, narrow paths that have been made off the  beaten  track.  It
is important that these people are provided with, at  least,  a  modicum  of
decent roads so that they can not only use these roads for walking to  their
destinations and so on, but so that taxis, buses and  other  forms  of  road
transport can also be adequately used.
I think that the hon the Minister set the tone when she said  that  in  some
of these construction exercises and the programmes, local  content  must  be
used. That is a very important factor, because too often we blame people  or
communities for expecting hand-outs from the Government, for not wanting  to
do anything of their own accord and for expecting the  Government  to  be  a
charitable organisation or something.

When we realise that local people can be engaged in helping  themselves,  in
involving themselves in any construction project,  whether  it  be  a  road,
community hall, or school, there is a sense of  not  only  empowerment,  but
more importantly, pride and ownership. No more do we have  things  that  are
foisted on the communities.

I know that my colleague Barbara Thomson did refer to instances of  some  of
these  institutions,  schools,  halls  or  whatever  being  built  and  then
remaining as white elephants which are not  used  by  the  people.  I  think
that, in fairness  to  the  Minister,  the  Government  is  now  engaged  in
partnership projects, in getting to  involve  the  communities  in  whatever
projects they might have, so that whatever construction is being done  there
is a common partnership affair and there is a sense of belonging.

The hon the Minister also referred to the involvement of  the  youth,  which
is very important in job creation opportunities. The  problem  is  that  our
youth  show  reluctance  to  get  involved  in  development  programmes   at
community level. That is because there is the  unfortunate  perception  that
some of these job  creation  programmes,  especially  in  the  rural  areas,
assault  their  dignity  because  the  income  is  palpably  low   and   not
commensurate with  that  of  their  urban  peers.  That  is  an  unfortunate
situation. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, hon Minister and colleagues, if one looks  at
the principles embraced in our RDP and  compares  them  to  the  reality  of
reconstruction and development on the ground, then  one  cannot  help  being
discouraged. The Department of  Public  Works,  it  seems,  has  drastically
moved away from the very purpose contained in the RDP which formed the  very
backbone  of  the  constitution  of   the   Community-Based   Public   Works
Programmes.

I am saying this not because I want to be unduly  critical,  but  because  I
was part of the delegation that went to the Eastern Cape earlier  this  year
and observed, first-hand, the deplorable state of affairs in the  Department
of Public Works. I am reluctant to focus my attention on the  Eastern  Cape,
because it is not an exclusively Eastern Cape problem. My province has  such
problems as well, and I have witnessed some of them.

When what we observed in the Eastern Cape  is  even  duplicated  in  another
province, then it is an  untenable  situation  that  cannot  be  allowed  to
continue unchanged. In some of the offices in  this  department,  especially
the road works  department,  there  is  no  work  ethic.  Workers  are  like
tourists, coming in and leaving whenever they feel the urge.  Management  is
conspicuous in its absence and the needs of the people  on  the  ground  are
often left entirely out of the equation.
May I bring to the Minister's attention my  own  province,  Mpumalanga,  and
the role that Public Works has played  in  alleviating  the  plight  of  the
poor. One must in fairness acknowledge that  some  work,  some  considerable
work, has been seen to be and is being done right now. Some of  the  poverty
alleviation projects gave  rise  to  flourishing  businesses  that  now  are
running on their own. I am not hearing any applause for the Minister here.

The standards of roads and other facilities are very high; so much  so  that
people are all flocking to become part of this corridor. I have  an  example
in mind, namely the Maputo Development Corridor.  It  has  created  so  many
other businesses and activities that now only the private sector is  visible
- as if there was no government, no public representatives.

This, I am afraid, has gone in some ways that we did not expect. It has  had
some unintended consequences. I must admit that it is good and bad as  well.
On the one hand everyone has a real opportunity to participate in  a  viable
project that encourages social upliftment and  black  economic  empowerment.
The  disadvantage  is  that  sometimes  it  only  benefits  those  in  close
proximity to those projects, and is to the detriment  of  others.  We  would
find, for example, that  the  quality  of  roads  and  other  infrastructure
outside of these preferred  areas  is  substandard  by  comparison.  Another
disadvantage is that  people  are  leaving  their  villages  and  towns  and
converging along those development corridors, in an  effort  to  get  in  on
this gravy.

Another disturbing trend in my province is the lack of  attention  that  the
Department of Public Works gives to the upgrading  of  national  roads.  For
the last two years there have  been  signs  all  along  the  roads,  warning
motorists about dangerous  potholes.  I  guess  these  signs  warning  about
potholes remain there even after these roads have been  fixed.  This  action
by itself is commendable, but if one takes into  account  that  nothing  has
been done for the past two years to improve  the  roads,  then  one  has  to
wonder whether potholes in the roads, like  farm  animals  wandering  across
the highways, are now to be considered the norm. The case of  stray  animals
has more to do with the community at large.  We  as  public  representatives
have a role to play there.

An area I would like the Minister to exercise  caution  in  is  the  use  of
contractors and consultants. The reason for this caution is obvious, but  my
interaction in the province has brought  into  sharp  focus  the  exorbitant
fees that these consultants charge. This is detrimental  to  poverty-focused
projects in at least two significant ways. It takes a  large  chunk  of  the
money away from the real projects and it also stalls black  empowerment  and
the transfer  of  skills.  Linked  to  the  aforementioned  concern  is  the
inability of people in charge of these projects to account  for  themselves.
Accounting here to me  does  not  only  involve  people.  It  also  involves
talking to the community well ahead of the project, during the  project  and
after the project.

In one particular project I was  sent  from  pillar  to  post  with  no  one
knowing for sure who was the financier of the project. This leaves the  door
wide open for unscrupulous contractors who firstly  do  not  listen  to  the
community and secondly do the  job  so  badly  that  it  requires  refixing.
Ironically, the refixing tender is often awarded to the same contractor  who
did the half-baked job in the first place.

By way of illustration, in my village contractors  came  to  build  a  storm
water drainage system. The villagers pointed out  that  the  layout  of  the
canals was faulty and could not work. No one  listened  and  the  result  is
that this drainage system is filled with silt and soil and  is  now  totally
nonfunctional. No one in my village has  benefited  in  any  way  from  this
project.

I believe we should not continually quote figures of  work  done  and  money
spent, but should rather be looking  at  real  development  on  the  ground.
[Time expired.]

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Chairperson, I am ready to  respond.  As  some
members were debating I felt they should have asked me to invite MECs to  be
present, because they are all flogging me about something which  is  not  my
competency. They are  also  talking  about  the  budget  which  is  sent  to
provinces and is allocated and in which Public Works nationally has no  say.
As each member stood up, I became dismayed and asked myself why I  had  been
called to this debate. In most cases it was a provincial debate. I  have  to
explain to the House that Public Works  nationally  only  deals  with  roads
that go to our projects, period.

Local government deals with roads falling under local authorities.  Most  of
the provincial roads are looked after by  the  provinces,  using  their  own
budgets.  Major  national  roads  are  dealt  with  by  the  Department   of
Transport. I want to appeal to members of the NCOP  to  understand  this.  I
will look at  Hansard  and  send  copies  to  the  MECs  so  that  they  can
understand what was said here.

The Council invited me to talk about poverty relief and I have explained  at
length what it is that we are doing. In order to deal with  poverty  relief,
one of the things we do is to go back to projects that used to work well  in
some of the homelands  where  there  was  infrastructure.  We  then  try  to
rehabilitate that infrastructure. Hence  we  have  what  we  call  community
production centres which deal, together with the Department  of  Agriculture
and sometimes the Department of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry,  with  these
issues.

I think that in each of the  three  regions  of  the  provinces  which  were
formerly said to be the most poverty stricken,  we  have  at  least  two  of
these community production centres. Provinces such as  Mpumalanga  were  not
even part of the equation. The national Department  of  Public  Works  knew,
however, that if there is  poverty  in  the  Eastern  Cape,  there  must  be
poverty in Mpumalanga.

 We ourselves decided to allocate some money to  deal  with  this  issue.  I
want to request the  select  committee  concerned  to  invite  me  to  their
meetings so that I can explain to them what kind of animal  national  Public
Works is, because, clearly, they do not know what kind  of  animal  national
Public Works is.

Ngithola ezinye izibongo manje. Ngithola ezinye izithakazelo ... [I  am  now
receiving new praises. I am receiving new clan praises.]

... and they are not those. We do meet with the provinces and  we  have  our
Minmec, where  we  try,  as  national  Public  Works,  to  lay  down  policy
guidelines which can assist them in developing their competence.

We come from a situation where, in some cases, people got  used  to  putting
on their coats and leaving work unfinished. I admit that we  still  have  to
work very hard to help provinces, even with monitoring.

Kgoshi Mokoena had a whole catalogue, which I  will  have  to  send  to  the
Eastern Cape  government,  because  it  is  not  the  national  department's
competence. What we as national department do  is  deal  with  accommodation
for national departments. We build infrastructure. If Correctional  Services
or the Department of Justice wants a new building, or  one  of  the  various
other departments needs office space, that is  what  we  deal  with.  It  is
called capital works.

Because some departments were not forthcoming with their requests, we  asked
the Department of Finance to devolve the budget, so  that  if  a  department
does not spend on its budget, it is no longer reflected as underspending  on
the part of Public  Works.  It  is  now  reflected  on  the  budget  of  the
department which did not come up with a plan  on  how  they  were  going  to
spend the money.

Regarding the question of the first member  who  spoke,  together  with  the
GCIS we have  what  are  called  multipurpose  centres,  like  the  one  the
President will be opening at Sterkspruit. Here we look at the exact  request
made. Some people are far removed from the villages  and  towns.  People  in
small towns like Mount Fletcher and Matatiele need Government services.

We have built multipurpose centres where pensions  can  be  paid  out  at  a
point not far from the  people  and  where  issues  concerning  the  police,
health, welfare and similar things can be dealt with, depending on the  area
and its needs. We have more  than  22  of  these  centres  which  have  just
started, because we saw the need to bring services to the people.

We also heard about all the white elephants Government has  created  because
of the integrated strategy. As part of our programme we go back and ask  how
we can change these from white elephants into something viable.

I want to mention an example. As new  Minister  of  Public  Works  this  one
struck me. A project had been built at Hlabisa for  quite  a  large  sum.  I
went to check on it. We found our structure, but no services were  delivered
from it. They were using  it  as  a  workshop  and  went  back  to  using  a
structure which we had not built, but which was near the road.

We discovered that no proper consultation with the people had  taken  place.
Together with the Department of Arts, Culture,  Science  and  Technology  we
decided to use the stalls, which we had envisaged would be used for  selling
products, as workshops for people to manufacture things. At the  request  of
the people, we put up another structure next to the road,  and  anyone  from
KwaZulu-Natal will tell hon members that  business  is  thriving  there.  We
examined the situation and decided we wanted to go  back  and  correct  what
had been done badly.

Members have rightly said that we should cut down  on  consultants.  Members
must invite us, not just to their portfolio  meetings,  but  also  to  their
study groups, I would even say across party lines, so  that  we  can  inform
people first-hand of what sort of development is going to  happen  in  their
areas. It is important that hon members, as MPs, should know  so  that  they
can co-operate with us.

In my department I always say - and my DG will bear me out - that I  do  not
understand why, if a request for a school comes from a  community,  we  must
employ somebody called a social facilitator and pay him 4% of the  value  of
the  project.  Why?  I  want  to  believe  that  any  local  authority,  any
traditional leader, any MP, can ensure that that programme  is  implemented,
that they can deal with all the problems around it, because that is what  we
have been voted to Parliament for.

I appeal to hon  members,  instead  of  being  critical,  to  come  up  with
solutions the next time I attend their meetings at portfolio level.  Dealing
with poverty and development in this country is a two-way project,  and  hon
members should contribute their opinions on what they think will change  the
situation. I am not being funny, but coming here with a litany  of  what  is
wrong in the provinces without making any suggestions on how to solve  these
problems is rather problematic.

Public Works has decided at national level to cut  down  on  consultants.  I
was shocked when I attended the launch of a beautiful  project  in  KwaZulu-
Natal. Upon enquiry I learnt that funding for the project was  R19  million,
but only R14 million had gone towards the work, I  was  told  the  other  R5
million had gone to consultants.
We went back to our department and we said we were not going to have any  of
that. We cut down on the national co-ordinating  structure,  into  which  we
had been pumping a lot of money. With the help  of  the  EU  we  got  people
within the department who are going to oversee some  of  the  work  to  make
sure that it happens.

Unfortunately, due to the new municipalities, and the bringing  together  of
a number of municipalities to form the bigger  structures,  a  lot  of  work
still has to be done in creating capacity in those new structures.

As department we had to go back to the drawing board hoping  that  we  would
be able to boast, as we did last year,  that  we  were  dealing  with  three
budgets and, by the end of 2001, would actually have spent all that money.

Khange bangxole kunyaka ophelileyo ... [They were not so loud last year.]

... because we used some of the money that was  allocated  to  public  works
for poverty-relief programmes that we thought were viable.

Members should also inform us first-hand if there  are  construction  people
who are building what we call winter roads. By winter roads,  I  mean  those
roads which will last just for a while.

Ngiye ngithi ngesintu: eyi, ishefiwe le migwaqo. [In my language I  used  to
say: Hey, these roads have been graded.]

This is because they sort of look clean-shaven.  They  are  supposed  to  be
gravel roads, but one does not find a single stone.  Then  we  say  that  if
people take such short cuts we have no business dealing with them.  We  have
also said that if there are companies which really give us shoddy  work,  we
will not hesitate to blacklist those companies, although some  hon  members,
as MPs, come back to  us  and  say,  ``Please  can  you  give  them  another
chance?'' Niyasixakekisa. [You are causing us trouble.]

The hon member will criticise us for doing shoddy work, then he or she  will
still come back to us and say ``Please give this company  work.''  Then  one
wonders where the integrity of the hon member is. What we want to  encourage
is the rewarding of those emerging contractors who are doing good work.

Niza kuthi ke Owu! uMaSigcawu unika ubani noobani. [You are  going  to  say:
Ms Sigcawu is biased, she gives some and does not give others.]

It is because we are short of people to do the work, and in any situation  a
reward is always given to somebody who has proved him or herself.

The last thing I want to say is that we are trying our best. I  will  accept
criticism where it is fair and due, but I have a lot of letters to write  to
the provinces, that is the Free State, the Eastern Cape and  Mpumalanga,  to
say what it is that concerns members here. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                          COMPANIES AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, I would like to  thank  you
for the generosity in the time you have given me - ten minutes  for  such  a
short Bill. I will not take up all that time, not because  I  do  not  value
the chance of speaking in the NCOP, but because I think it is  a  relatively
short amendment.

Members of the House, this is a very small amendment. It would  seem  to  be
technical, but in some ways it is quite an exciting amendment.  In  essence,
what  it  is  designed  to  achieve  is  the  facility  to  lodge  documents
electronically in the companies registration office. This  is  an  important
development. It will not replace the paper-based documentation  that  is  in
the companies registration office, but opens all the possibilities of  being
able to interact with this office from all over South Africa.

We are near the end of setting up our system,  which  will  allow  just  for
this. The next phase of our project would be to begin  to  allow  electronic
placement  of  documents  for  the   companies   registration   office   and
intellectual properties office from  a  very  wide  range  of  input  points
across the country.

The amendment is  technical  in  the  main,  dealing  with  this  matter  of
allowing for electronic documentation to be lodged. It does also  deal  with
certain small technical matters to make the Bill consistent  in  itself  and
with the current situation.

I would urge members to support what is a  small  amendment,  but  one  that
opens the way for the new electronic age. [Applause.]

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, owing to the unanimous  support  of  the  Select
Committee on Economic Affairs we decided to make brief  statements  on  this
amendment. Therefore I am speaking on behalf of the opposition parties.
The   opposition   parties   support   the    Companies    Amendment    Bill
unconditionally. The Bill is a practical acknowledgement  that  our  country
is adapting to the information  revolution  and  the  globalisation  of  the
world economies.

A lot of other legislation will also have to follow suit  to  keep  up  with
the enhancement in worldwide information flow, and we will have to  legalise
the new world of e-commerce. The Companies Act of 1973 was  written  without
any  consideration  for  electronic  processing  of   documentation   mainly
because, at that point in time, electronic documentation and any  processing
thereof was but a mere dream of the future.

This Bill needs to amend the Companies Act of 1973 to enable  the  lodgement
of documents and disclosure of information in respect of companies by  means
of the electronic process.

The Bill seeks to introduce provisions enabling the following:  the  phasing
in of electronic lodgement of corporate forms; the phasing in of  electronic
payment of prescribed  fees  and  other  fees  for  services  rendered;  and
electronic disclosure of corporate information.

It needs to be clearly understood that this new system  has  been  developed
as an additional functionality and it will in no way  replace  the  existing
paper-based structures and procedures  of  lodgement  of  documents  at  the
companies registration office. It may, however, in time become the main  way
of dealing with the companies registration office.

From the above-mentioned it is evident that this Bill is clearly  needed  to
enhance the South African economic  system,  and  therefore  the  opposition
parties support the Companies Amendment Bill, B35 of 2001,  unconditionally.
[Applause.]

Mr S L E FENYANE: Chairperson, it is the  reality  of  our  times  that  the
modern world is one driven by technology,  and  South  Africa  is  part  and
parcel of that world.

In the 1996 Budget Vote the hon President Mr Mbeki said:


  The revolution in modern  technology  has  ensured  that  information  is
  delivered at the next destination with speed that defies imagination.

Challenges brought about by this revolution place the responsibility  on  us
of transforming and aligning ourselves to respond to challenges of  the  New
World Order in which technology is our daily bread.

Because of the uneven development between urban and rural areas and  between
the provinces themselves,  we  need  to  give  priority  to  electronic  and
information technology infrastructure, because  that  is  where  the  people
need these resources to  improve  the  conditions  of  their  lives  and  to
enlighten themselves with information.

The need for the Government to create the necessary  mechanisms  to  provide
the people with information becomes imperative because of the  evolution  of
our history. We therefore have to  address  this  challenge  if  we  are  to
promote economic growth and development and enable all  to  gain  access  to
the best in human civilisation in our country. The Companies Amendment  Bill
of 2001 seeks to do that.

The Companies Act of 1973 was written  without  any  consideration  for  the
electronic processing of documentation, mainly  because  at  that  point  in
time electronic documentation and processing thereof were but a  mere  dream
of the future, like flying space cars  in  our  times.  The  Bill  seeks  to
increase investment in electronic and information technology, without  which
we would not be able to bridge the digital divide.

It was only four years ago that the SA Companies Registration Office, in co-
operation with Sars, various departments  of  state,  other  regulators  and
interested parties from the private sector, embarked on the  development  of
a completely electronic and computerised system  for  the  incorporation  of
companies  and  close  corporations  and  the  registration   of   corporate
information, in respect of these entities.

The main purpose of this  electronic  system  is  to  enable  the  companies
registration office to decentralise its services  as  soon  as  possible  to
even the most remote  areas.  This  is  possible  with  a  properly  managed
electronic central  database,  and  it  can,  effectively,  be  achieved  by
utilising  all  available  outlets  of  government  offices,  post  offices,
organisations, private businesses and by individual access to the  Internet.
The Bill therefore seeks to amend the Companies Act to enable  lodgement  of
documents and disclosure of information in respect of companies by means  of
electronic processes.

One of the main attributes of introducing this electronic system is that  it
will enable the companies registration office to take its  registration  and
disclosure services to the masses in the whole of  South  Africa,  including
remote areas and the global community.

Currently, there is only one national office  in  Pretoria  providing  these
services, but with a  proper  database  and  electronic  processing  system,
which would allow for  remote  electronic  lodgement  of  documentation  and
requests for information, these services can be properly  decentralised,  as
aforesaid.

In this regard, it is  the  intention  to  provide  the  majority  of  these
services,  not  only  via  the  Internet  in  order  to  make  them  readily
available, but also through various public and other  participating  offices
throughout the country. It is without doubt that in the  times  we  live  in
technology constitutes an engine for economic development. It is my  belief,
therefore, that this initiative will have a directly positive impact on  the
lives of South Africa's people.

I would like to thank the select committee for accepting  the  amendment  of
this Bill.

I would like to quote the hon Aziz Pahad's words in his  address  on  Africa
Day from John Reader's book, Africa: A Biography of the Continent, where  he
says:


  South Africa preserves the flickering hope of  transforming  dreams  into
  reality, affirming the value of integrity and  ideals  in  an  era  where
  economic pragmatism is the dominant theme of world affairs.

Let us face the future with  confidence  and  keep  on  being  pragmatic  to
better the lives of our people.

I humbly urge the House to support this Bill. It is central  to  development
and rapid economic growth. It is, indeed, a  technical  amending  Bill,  but
its implications are broad. It prepares us today  for  the  future  that  we
have always dreamt of. It effectively tells us that  we  have  embedded  the
past and the future in the present and that it is possible to visualise  and
live the future in the present. I therefore urge  members  to  support  this
Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.


                      COUNTERFEIT GOODS AMENDMENT BILL

                       TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL

               (Consideration of Bills and of Reports thereon)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, once again, the  amendments
that the hon members have before them, and there will be  a  subsequent  one
to  come,  are  a  linked  set  of  amendments  in  these  related  Acts  on
trademarks. They are being amended through Trade  Practices  Amendment  Bill
and the Counterfeit Goods Amendment Bill.

There is an amendment which deals, specifically and most  importantly,  with
the concept of a well-known mark. In terms of the Trips  agreement,  certain
marks that are very well known do have  a  status.  The  case  that  we  are
familiar with in South Africa  would  be  MacDonalds,  as  hon  members  may
recall. The  position,  however,  is  that  each  national  jurisdiction  or
judicial system makes decisions about what a well-known mark is or  is  not.
We did not have  that  definition  in  the  Counterfeit  Goods  Act  and  we
proposed to introduce it.

There are other smaller amendments dealing with consistency  matters in  the
main and also relate to copyright, prohibited marks and how they  appear  or
should not appear.

The final amendment to the Counterfeit Goods Act deals with the question  of
searches. It is fairly obvious that in a matter  like  this,  one  needs  to
move quite quickly and decisively in order to prove that  counterfeit  goods
exist. There was some degree of lack of clarity in the Act and we  are  thus
proposing the amendments that have been put forward. I would like  to  thank
the portfolio committees for the improvements which they have made in  these
amendments.

The next Act is the Trade Practices Act and  the  amendment  that  is  being
made there. This is something we needed to have done, but it is  interesting
that the impetus for doing it quickly was, in fact, the  Cricket  World  Cup
which comes up in 2003.

All  hon  members  are  probably  familiar  with  this  concept  of   ambush
marketing, that basically one can get sponsors  to  a  big  event  who  will
sponsor the event and put their own advertising there, and all of  a  sudden
Minister Alec Erwin flies in with  a  big  balloon  that  says  ``Vote  Alec
Erwin'', right over the cricket festival. That is called  ambush  marketing.
Of course, that is a really extreme example. I do not think  that  there  is
really any need for me to ask hon members to vote for me. But that  is  what
ambush marketing is. It is quite an important and crucial issue,  and  as  I
say, for a major event like World Cup Cricket, there  was  a  need  for  the
sponsors to have certainty about this.

One of the issues in this regard has been that people  feel  a  bit  nervous
about whether this would prevent small and medium  enterprises  from  coming
in and showing their small  logos  or  whatever.  It  certainly  would  not.
Specifically in relation to the Cricket World Cup, it will  be  one  of  the
biggest joint projects that we will do regarding any  major  events  between
DTI and the sponsors of these events, which will bring in small  and  medium
enterprises across a wide range of activities in preparation  for  the  cup.
So  what  we  are  dealing  with  here  are  major  sponsorships  in   which
advertisers put their boards up, and someone who does not  sponsor  anything
uses the prominence of that event to just  come  in  and  try  to  advertise
their product.

This is what we have dealt with in the  main  with  these  amendments.  Once
again, I would suggest that these are important technical  amendments  which
continually update and refine South Africa's intellectual property laws  and
trademark laws, and I would urge that we support them. [Applause.]

Mr T S SETONA: Chairperson and hon Minister, I  believe  that  the  Minister
has indeed covered every technical aspect of the amendment that I was  going
to talk about, and more  so.  Given  the  fact  that  there  was  a  general
consensus at  the  level  of  the  select  committee,  therefore,  with  due
respect, I would like to thank members  of  the  opposition  for  their  co-
operation in the course  of  the  deliberation  on  this  Bill.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  That  was  the
shortest speech. It will definitely go into the Guinness Book of Records.

Dr E A CONROY:  Chairperson,  Minister  Erwin  and  colleagues,  counterfeit
goods are described as goods which are the result of  counterfeiting,  which
is in turn described as the  active  producing  or  manufacturing  of  goods
without the permission of the persons  who  own  the  intellectual  property
rights existing in respect of those particular goods.

The original Counterfeit Goods Act, Act  37  of  1997,  introduced  measures
aimed at, in the first instance, fighting against the trade  in  counterfeit
goods so  as  to  further  protect  the  legitimate  owners  of  trademarks,
copyrights and certain marks under the Merchandise Marks Act.  Secondly,  it
introduced measures aimed at addressing the unlawful  application  to  goods
of the subject  matter  of  the  respective  intellectual  property  rights.
Thirdly,  it  introduced  measures  aimed  at  fighting   the   release   of
counterfeit goods into the commercial market  and  channels.  However,  when
this Act was promulgated in 1997, legal commentators  were  of  the  opinion
that the term ``counterfeit goods'' was too wide and that it  ran  the  risk
of treating genuine goods as counterfeit or pirated goods.

The purpose  of  this  Bill  is,  therefore,  to  amend  the  definition  of
intellectual property rights so as to extend these rights to include  rights
in trademarks which are entitled to protection under the  Paris  Convention,
whereby goods with marks which are well known in South Africa will  also  be
protected under the Act. This will also allow the  seizure  and  destruction
of goods that infringe on such trademarks.

Die Wysigingswetsontwerp op Handelspraktyke het  ten  doel  om  die  Wet  op
Handelspraktyke  van  1976  te  wysig   ten   einde   praktyke   bekend   as
``hinderlaagbemarking'',  of  die  sogenaamde  ``ambush   marketing'',   ten
opsigte van geborgde geleenthede te verbied.

Hierdie wanpraktyk, wat tydens die promulgering van  die  wet  nog  onbekend
was en dus nie in die wet opgeneem kon word nie, bestaan uit  die  opsetlike
optrede deur 'n persoon om 'n misleidende of valse indruk  te  skep  van  'n
kontraktuele of ander verbintenis met 'n geborgde geleentheid,  waar  so  'n
verbintenis in der waarheid nie bestaan nie.

Hierdie twee wysigingswetsontwerpe, naamlik  die  eersgenoemde  ten  opsigte
van  ``counterfeit   goods''   en   die   laasgenoemde   ten   opsigte   van
handelspraktyke, loop in der waarheid hand aan hand, aangesien  dit  in  die
finale instansie om die beskerming van  intellektuele  eiendom  gaan.  Beide
wetsontwerpe  het  nodig  geword  om  die  regverdige  bedryf  van   gesonde
handelspraktyke te verseker, en hou  geen  finansiële  implikasies  vir  die
staat in nie.

Ons steun beide  die  wetsontwerpe.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[The objective of the Trademarks  Amendment  Bill  is  to  amend  the  Trade
Practices Act of 1976 in order to prohibit the practice  known  as  ``ambush
marketing'' in respect of sponsored events.

This malpractice, which was still unknown during  promulgation  of  the  law
and therefore could not be included in the law, consists of  the  deliberate
actions by a person  to  create  a  false  or  misleading  impression  of  a
contractual or  other  relationship  with  a  sponsored  event,  where  such
relationship in fact does not exist.

These two amending Bills, the  first-mentioned  in  respect  of  counterfeit
goods, and the latter in respect of trade  practices  in  fact  go  hand  in
hand, as in the final analysis they concern intellectual goods.  Both  Bills
have become necessary to ensure the just practice of sound trade  practices,
and do not have any financial implications for the state.

We support both these Bills.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, as the  Minister  said,  it  is  not  the  Bill,
really, which is so important, though important it is,  but  the  continuing
trend, the family of Bills and the direction  in  which  the  Government  is
going that is really significant here. I want to congratulate  the  Minister
and the  department  on  these  Bills.  After  years  of  isolation,  it  is
wonderful to see.

The Bill brings us forcefully back  into  the  mainstream  of  international
conventions, as a consequence  of  our  having  ratified  the  Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  Convention.  It  allows  us,  thus,
additional protection under the Paris Convention. I have to say  that  after
a blip in which, I think, some unfortunate perceptions were created  by  the
debate over the past few years on generic  medicines,  I  believe  the  Bill
will again confirm that South Africa is and remains squarely committed in  a
globalising world to the concept of the protection of intellectual  property
rights. Thus we support this Bill very strongly.

Of course, the problem remains that China is not yet a member of  the  World
Trade Organisation, which creates problems for everybody, including us.  But
one hopes that China's formal admission to the WTO,  which  now  seems  more
than  likely,  will  pave  the  way  for  her  accession  to  all  of  these
conventions that we are talking about.

With regard to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill, in  seeking  to  prohibit
certain practices such as  ``ambush  marketing''  in  respect  of  sponsored
events, the Government is simply responding to  the  growing  sophistication
of our sponsored leisure/sport and art international industry,  bringing  us
in  line  with  international  best  practice.  By  creating  a   favourable
environment for sponsors  to  sponsor  sporting  events  and  other  events,
including the arts, we make  a  contribution  to  stimulating  those  events
themselves, making sponsorships possible and attractive. Thus, we  are  also
able thereby to bring our populations that perhaps have not enjoyed many  of
these  sports  and  events  back  into  the  mainstream  of   those   events
themselves. We support this measure. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms M P  THEMBA:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  today  we  are
addressing two crucial Bills, namely the Trade Practices Amendment  Bill  in
conjunction with the Counterfeit Goods Amendment  Bill.  The  amendments  of
these Bills are both necessary and important as  they  will  strengthen  the
protection of intellectual property rights  and  also  benefit  the  broader
South African public and businesses.

Gone are the days when we were a pariah state isolated by  the  whole  world
owing to our notorious policies of  the  past.  Today  we  are  part  of  an
interdependent world, which is often called the global  village.  Thanks  to
the struggles of our people, we are no longer living on an island.

I am quite sure that all of us here in our offices use  computers  that  are
made somewhere else. All  of  us  take  our  children  out  for  a  meal  to
McDonald's, and I know that all of us have bought Nike  takkies.  These  are
global brands and they are available right here  in  our  country.  Some  of
them are made locally.

Today South Africans own franchises of global brands right here in  our  own
country. Some of these belong to  what  are  called  well-known  trademarks.
These play  an  important  role  in  our  economy,  in  particular,  in  job
creation. For instance, Nike shops are found all over the country.

We are part of major games and events, for example the Olympic Games,  world
cups, and of a bodies such as Fifa, etc. Not  so  long  ago  we  hosted  the
Rugby World Cup. Not only was it a success, but  we  also  claimed  the  cup
itself. We also hope to  host  more  games,  claim  more  cups  and  attract
investments  to  boost  our  economy.  The  global  sponsorship  market   is
continuing to expand rapidly and rights fees  are  continuing  to  escalate.
Hosting these games in our country brings and  attracts  investments.  Those
also create jobs.

The above-mentioned opportunities are examples of some of the  things  which
we had no access to in the past, owing  to  our  notorious  policies.  As  a
result, the previous Acts did not  give  clear-cut  legislation  to  protect
certain rights as they were alien and not so relevant to us. In  particular,
there are the well-known trademarks, and the combating  of  what  is  called
``ambush marketing,'' as the Minister  has  said.  These  areas,  therefore,
require proper and specific legislation.

The  amendments  of  these  Bills  are  not  only  important  but  are  also
necessary. Some  of  the  typical  examples  are  unauthorised  merchandise,
unauthorised  or  unofficial  publications,  unauthorised  sales   promotion
activity or public stunts,  unauthorised  broadcasts,  virtual  advertising,
web  advertising,  unofficial  corporate  hospitality,  etc.  The  list   is
endless. They may or  may  not  involve  any  clear  and  direct  breach  of
proprietary rights in an event, such as trademark infringement. Some of  the
most common consequences are the loss  of  revenue  to  sports  bodies,  the
undermining of sponsor investment and the erosion of exclusive rights.

The question therefore is: How do we deal with this problem? The  answer  is
simple: through legislation. This is exactly what we are doing today. It  is
even  conceivable  that  the  chances  of  succeeding  in   bids   to   host
international events could be prejudiced by the failure of a nation and  its
sporting bodies to deal both practically and legally with ambush  marketing.
As I have stated before, we still have high ambitions -  or  should  I  say,
convictions -  of  hosting  more  games  and  international  events  in  our
country.

In our committee we are also united. We have all agreed  to  the  amendments
of these two Bills. Democracy is within the committee. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, members  of  the  House,  I
must say one thing that I find very  important  in  these  debates  is  that
members do deal with the technicalities of the laws. I think  this  is  very
important. We are going to find that in the realm of  intellectual  property
that more and more developments will be taking place in  the  coming  years.
Certainly in the WTO, some very complex and technical negotiations  will  be
occurring on these matters. I think the fact that our committee members  are
familiar with the technicalities is really to be welcomed. I thank them.

I would like to make one or two very brief points. I would  like  to  stress
that  in  South  Africa  we  are  very  committed  to  the   protection   of
intellectual property within the framework that it is accepted currently  in
the world dispensation. I think one of the reasons  for  this  is  something
that is often forgotten and that  we  lose  sight  of,  and  that  is  that,
generally speaking, in the developing world, we have fallen  far  behind  in
protecting our own intellectual property. So we  should  see  this  as  very
much something that we can take  advantage  of  in  protecting  intellectual
property as our economies unfold,  as  we  begin  to  bring  in  traditional
knowledge, as we begin to  expand  our  scientific  endeavours  in  our  own
terrain and domains.

Let me say, too, that the hon Kent Durr raised the issue of China.  This  is
one of  the  reasons  why  we  in  South  Africa  have  been  very  strongly
supportive of bringing China into the WTO. I think  one  cannot  have  major
economies, China  being  far  and  away  the  largest,  and  also  very  big
economies like Iran and others who are not in the WTO. I  think  we  need  a
common trade system across  the  world,  and  we  would  support  that  very
strongly.

I think many people may wonder -I received a note,  to  the  effect  that  -
what do we do with counterfeit goods. This quite  a  complex  and  difficult
issue. Obviously if one takes them and just sells them  again,  one  defeats
the original purpose of seizing them, of taking them out of the market.  But
we have begun  some  interesting  programmes  and  projects  on  counterfeit
goods, namely to  break  up  these  goods  and  transform  them  into  other
products. Then they can  be  utilised  to  generate  smaller  businesses  in
products which do not compete with the original intention.

In the cases of products such as clothing,  we  do,  from  time  to  time  -
recently we did this - make these products available for  emergency  relief.
But we do not let them into the market. In a general sense, we try  and  use
them for crisis emergency relief. But there is a difficulty.

I would urge members to encourage people, everybody, including  hawkers  and
flea markets, to obey the law. Most of us walk through a flea  market,  look
at a product and say: I bet that is not a real Nike cap. It does not  really
help us to just walk past and ignore it. We should be  telling  hawkers  and
traders in flea markets that it is not in their interests to  violate  these
laws, because, over time, what it means is that no one wants to come in  and
invest in our economy.

The hon  member  mentioned  Nike.  Now,  we  are  beginning  to  manufacture
products for Nike that will be sold all over the  world,  and  they  are  an
important part of our export  trade.  They  are  not  going  to  invest  and
produce here if our own intellectual laws in the market are so bad,  and  no
one is going to come here. So I think we must  take  a  mature,  far-sighted
view that the better our regulatory  environment,  the  more  investment  we
will attract and the more decent jobs we will be  able  to  provide  to  the
people. Trying to take a short cut by breaking the law and  getting  into  a
flea market might sound good in the short term, but basically  it  keeps  us
underdeveloped. So we welcome the support that hon members have given  these
amendments, and I thank them for the work they have  done  on  this  matter.
[Applause.]

                    CORRECTIONAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL
                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chairperson, hon members,  one  thing
I have realised about visiting this House a little  bit  late  is  that  one
misses media attention. [Laughter.] But what is advantageous,  at  the  same
time, is that one will find people who are ready to  go,  who  cannot  fight
anymore, who do not want to be detained but just want to go. So I will  make
it simple. [Laughter.]

I wish to present  the  Correctional  Services  Amendment  Bill,  2001,  for
consideration by this honourable House. The Correctional Services  Act,  Act
111 of 1998, that  is  the  principal  Act,  marked  the  beginning  of  the
transformation process  towards  prison  reform  in  South  Africa.  It  was
assented to by the President on 27 November 1998.

The drafting of a new Act, with the intention  to  repeal  the  Correctional
Services Act of 1959, was necessitated by the  democratic  revolution  which
has been taking place in our country in the past decade.
In order to grasp the fundamentals that formed the basis  for  the  drafting
of the principal Act, it is  important  to  understand  the  context,  which
defines the history of the South African correctional  system.  The  history
of the South African prison system has been described  as  a  history  of  a
system that formed part of the state  apparatus  of  a  minority  government
then, which applied explicitly racial criteria. The main  purpose  then  was
to ``lock them up and throw away  the  key''.  Obviously,  this  was  not  a
civilised way of treating human beings. It is against this  background  that
we identified the need to change the policy.

In creating a completely new legal framework, the principal Act  had  to  be
underpinned by the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic  of  South
Africa Act of 1996. The principal Act also incorporated the requirements  of
the  United  Nations'  international  conventions  on   the   treatment   of
offenders.

It is often said that a nation is judged  by  the  way  it  treats  its  own
prisoners. I think I had that experience when I was in this  House,  when  I
was quizzed about terminally ill prisoners.  I  am  still  waiting  for  the
questions.

The primary objective of the principal Act was therefore  to  create  a  new
legal framework in conformity with the principles  which  underpin  an  open
and democratic society. It is, therefore, only the beginning.

The actual  transformation  process  is  currently  under  way,  which  will
culminate in the development of a White Paper on correctional services.  The
White Paper process will assist the  department  to  generate  interest  and
understanding  amongst   stakeholders   of   the   challenges   facing   the
correctional system in playing an effective role in crime prevention  within
the overall context of an integrated criminal justice system.

It has therefore become necessary to bring  forward  certain  amendments  to
the principal Act to ensure  that  the  transformation  process  remains  on
track and continues to deliver the desired outcomes.
In the process of drafting subordinate legislation and implementing  certain
aspects of the Act, it became apparent, based on  practical  considerations,
that certain amendments would be necessary in order to fully  implement  the
principal  Act  and  to  be  more  compliant  with  the  provisions  of  the
Constitution and the international conventions to which we  are  signatories
as a country.

Clause 9 of the Bill places a duty on the department to provide, as  far  as
practicable, measures to accommodate  prisoners  with  disabilities  and  to
create an environment that is gender-sensitive.

Clause 12 puts in place certain procedural  and  substantive  safeguards  in
disciplinary proceedings involving prisoners, such as the  proper  recording
of the proceedings at an informal hearing before the head of prison and  the
right to legal representation at a  formal  hearing  before  a  disciplinary
official.

Clauses 17, 18 and 19 provide for the circumstances under  which  force  may
be used by a correctional official, including the procedures to be  followed
for the use of firearms and  other  nonlethal  incapacitating  devices.  For
instance, this will now be pertinent in the Act and  not  relegated  to  the
regulations as suggested by the initial text  of  the  principal  Act.  This
also contributes to efficient checks and balances to prevent  the  abuse  of
physical power and to ensure the safety of prisoners.

Clause  20  entrenches  the  right  of  child  offenders  to  education  and
training, and prohibits the utilisation of child offenders for labour  other
than work aimed at developing their skills.

The lack of community involvement in the parole system has been a matter  of
grave  concern  for  many  of  us.  In  terms  of  the  principal  Act,  the
composition of the Parole Board will now include two permanent members  from
the community, and full-time  ex-officio  members  from  the  Department  of
Correctional  Services,  the  Department  of  Justice   and   Constitutional
Development and the SA Police Services. The  board  will  be  chaired  by  a
member  of  the  community.  The  new  parole  system  also   provides   for
representations to be made to the Parole Board,  either  by  the  victim  in
person or by his representative.

The inclusion of clause 30 is intended to  assist  the  department  and  the
Government in managing the scourge of overcrowding in our prisons.  Part  of
this provision which deals with unsentenced prisoners was  not  included  in
the principal Act. Thus we had long consultations  with  the  Department  of
Justice and Constitutional  Development,  select  committees  and  portfolio
committees, because there was a concern that there might be a breach of  the
separation of powers.  But  I  was  informed  that  an  agreement  had  been
reached, and that is why we are bringing this amendment to this House.

To address challenges presented by overcrowding, the department is  involved
in a  number  of  interdepartmental  projects  developed  within  the  crime
prevention, justice and safety cluster.
These include the following. There is an  awaiting  trial-prisoner  project,
which is meant to reduce the detention cycle of awaiting-trial prisoners  in
an integrated manner. This system has  been  piloted  at  seven  sites.  The
official launch of the national rollout took place on 17 August 2001,  where
a further 26 sites were identified, and it is  envisaged  that  it  will  be
implemented before July 2002.

The department is further involved in the Saturday courts project which  was
introduced in 99 courts countrywide. During February  2001,  the  number  of
awaiting-trial prisoners  in  custody  at  these  prisons  served  by  those
specific courts declined by 12%, that is from 4 355 to about 36 300.

We intend also to dramatically increase the accommodation  capacity  of  the
prison  system  by  as  much  as  an  additional  30  000  beds  during  the
forthcoming MTEF. This will be achieved by building low-cost  new-generation
prisons for medium- and low-risk prisoner categories, who are  the  majority
of the country's prison population at the moment.
These facilities will be situated strategically around the  country  in  the
areas most  affected  by  overcrowding.  This  building  programme  will  be
supported by the development of construction norms and  standards  based  on
what is called new-generation design principles to achieve  low  life  cycle
facility costs. These construction norms and standards  will  be  translated
into facility design prototypes based on economical  and  practical  designs
and solutions.

Lastly,  the  department   wishes   to   further   increase   its   existing
accommodation capacity, which means that approximately 8 000  beds  will  be
added to the system, with the commissioning of several new prisons. At  this
stage, 33 prisons have been identified for repair and maintenance.

The Department of Correctional Services has decided  to  put  rehabilitation
and restorative justice at the centre of its  operations.  Concentration  on
rehabilitation is meant to strike a balance between rehabilitation and  safe
custody. This has subsequently  brought  the  need  for  the  reskilling  of
officials in  rehabilitation  techniques,  thereby  enhancing  the  goal  of
rehabilitation.

For rehabilitation to succeed, prisoners must  be  treated  as  individuals,
with each prisoner having his or her own problem.  The  development  of  the
individualised needs-based  rehabilitation  programmes  entails  specialised
treatment and development programmes for prisoners in partnership  with  the
communities and the offender. In other words, we are saying that  unless  we
partner with the community,  we  will  not  succeed  in  our  programmes  of
rehabilitation.

This is done by  enhancing  the  personal  and  social  functioning  of  all
offenders in line with their individual needs,  with  a  view  to  preparing
them  for  reintegration  as  productive,   well-adapted   and   law-abiding
citizens. I am looking at the hon Kent Durr, who seems to be saying:  ``That
is a tall order, Minister!''

The active engagement of the community in the rehabilitation process of  the
prisoner as a collective responsibility strengthens our partnership  in  the
treatment of the prisoner. We shall continue to  endeavour  to  promote  and
enhance community involvement  in  order  to  ensure  a  structured  working
relationship, and to regulate involvement between role-players.

The exercise of promoting restorative justice is meant to create a  platform
for  dialogue  between  the  offender,  the  victim  and  the  community  to
facilitate the healing process. We believe that this process will heal  more
that it will hurt.

  In  conclusion,  in  relation  to  the  Census  2001,  the  Department  of
Correctional Services is assisting Statistics South Africa  in  the  process
of managing the census in prisons. A working  relationship  with  Statistics
South Africa was established at both provincial and national  levels,  where
we confirmed our commitment to the process. Correctional Services  officials
have been assisting with the completion of questionnaires within prisons  on
a voluntary basis. Some provincial  commissioners  have  reported  that  the
process is running smoothly at this stage and it is also envisaged that  the
process will be completed by the week ending on 19 October  2001,  which  is
well ahead of the deadline set by Statistics South Africa.

It is now my sincere and fervent hope that all members will  see  their  way
clear to accepting the amending Bill which I have tabled before  this  House
this afternoon. God bless. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson and hon members,  on  27  August  2001,  the
Select  Committee  on  Security  and  Constitutional  Affairs  visited  some
prisons in various provinces. Some shocking  discoveries  were  made  during
those visits.

I would like to thank my colleagues in the  committee  for  taking  all  the
time to visit these prisons. This is precisely what is  expected  of  us  as
the NCOP members - to play our oversight role  and  monitoring.  To  them  I
say, well done.

It is clear that we are following a concept which says, ``Every  day  is  an
election day. The devil always votes against you but,  God  votes  for  you.
But, more importantly, you as a group, you cast the deciding vote''.

Those visits enabled the  select  committee  to  carefully  scrutinise  this
Bill. It amends a few  sections  of  the  principal  Act.  The  Correctional
Services  Act  has  met  with  critical  acclaim  from   many   experts   of
correctional services as one of the best in this country and  from  ordinary
South Africans as a fundamental break with our oppressive past.

The Act accurately reflects the values of  respect  for  human  dignity  and
other fundamental human rights in our Constitution.  In  many  respects  the
Act accurately reflects these values. Yet it is is  not  enough  for  it  to
merely reflect them. It must also be able to provide  for  mechanisms  which
can practically implement these values.

It has since become clear that there are some shortcomings  in  the  current
Act, hence this amending Bill. Some of the amendments  are  of  a  technical
nature, but there are some that will bring about fundamental changes to  the
principal Act.

If the Bill is passed, it will bring back the dignity of children  who  find
themselves in prison with their mothers. It is also going to deal  with  the
question of overcrowding. It also deals with corrupt  officials  within  the
department. Unlike in the past, when one could easily equate a  prison  with
hell, the Bill makes it possible, for examples, for  amenities  to  be  made
available to prisoners. The Bill also makes it  possible  for  prisoners  to
access reading materials and recreational facilities.

Prisoners in most prisons are accommodated in the same cells, regardless  of
the crimes each prisoner has committed. That will be a thing  of  the  past.
The Bill allows the  commissioner  to  restrict,  suspend  or  separate  the
prisoners accordingly. Conditions in our prisons have not been  friendly  to
prisoners with disabilities. In this Bill that has been taken care of.
The Bill also makes it possible for prisoners, when  attending  disciplinary
hearings,  to  be  represented  by  a  legal  representative.  Firearms   or
ammunition cannot be used against prisoners at random.  The  Bill  regulates
how and when it can be used. For example, a Correctional  Services  official
can only use firearms as a last resort when his or her life is in danger  or
threatened, or even when a prisoner tries to escape.

During its visits to prisons, the committee  was  made  aware  that  in  one
prison in the Western Cape there was a 14-year old boy who had  been  caught
stealing grapes on Mr Potgieter's farm. The value of  the  grapes  was  only
R15. He was still awaiting trial. He could not raise the R200 bail.  He  had
been in that prison for three months.

In one prison in Gauteng, there was a 12-year-old boy who had been  arrested
for stealing a packet  of  bananas  to  the  value  of  R5  from  a  Mr  Van
Rensburg's fruit market. He  was  still  awaiting  trial.  Unfortunately  he
could not raise the R200 bail. He had been in that prison for four months.
What about the 13-year-old boy in one  of  the  prisons  in  Giyani  in  the
Northern Province who had been caught stealing three  avocados  from  Mr  De
Jager's farm? The value of the three avocados was  R6.  He  also  could  not
raise the R300 bail. As I am speaking here, the boy is still in  prison.  He
has been there for seven months. The two boys in  Gauteng  and  the  Western
Cape are unfortunately accommodated in the same cells as  prisoners  charged
with murder, car hijacking, robbery and housebreaking.

Now let us for a while imagine how much the department is spending on  these
young boys, considering the kinds of crimes they committed. Those  who  know
better are saying that the department spends not less than  R90  per  person
per day.

Having considered all these facts, the select committee  under  the  capable
leadership of my predecessor, the hon J L Mahlangu,  postponed  the  passage
of this Bill to enable stakeholders and the department to  make  some  input
as to how to correct these anomalies.

The select committee again, under the vibrant leadership of the hon  Tsietsi
Setona, who was the acting chair by then, also deferred the passage of  this
Bill to allow the Departments of Correctional Services and  of  Justice  and
Constitutional Development to sort  out  their  differences  and  advise  us
accordingly.

For a third time the committee, under the wonderful,  marvellous,  cool  and
calculated leadership of yours truly ... [Laughter.] ... in addition to  the
two departments, asked the State Law Adviser to give his  legal  opinion.  I
am sure members are aware that I am now dealing with the  famous  clause  30
of the Bill, which proposes to amend section 81 of the  principal  Act.  The
gist of this clause  is  that  unsentenced  prisoners  with  minor  offences
should be released. But before they are released,  certain  things  have  to
happen.

When the committee met on 2 October, the two departments, together with  the
State Law Adviser, informed us that they now  agreed  with  the  formulation
brought by the State Law Adviser. They advised the committee to accept  that
formulation.

If one looks at all the steps taken by the committee, one will realise  that
we wanted to get an amicable  solution  which  would  try  to  rectify  this
mistake or the differences between the two departments.  Our  concern  as  a
committee was to get a mechanism  that  would  address  the  crisis  in  our
prisons. Had the committee been advised  that  this  crisis  could  best  be
handled by the Department Agriculture or the  Department  of  Water  Affairs
and Forestry, we would have accepted that. As long as it  was  going  to  be
done lawfully and constitutionally, it did not matter much who was going  to
rectify it or come up with that legislation.

I would like to thank the Chief Whip for always being there  to  assist  the
committee, whenever there seemed to be some confusion.  His  willingness  to
assist us will not go unnoticed. It is with pride  and  joy  that  I  humbly
inform the House that I support the Bill.

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, as appears from the opinions of the  State  Law
Advisers, the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development  and  the
National Director of Public Prosecutions on the one hand, and those  of  the
Department of Correctional Services and the Inspecting Judge  on  the  other
hand, there are differing viewpoints in respect of clause  30  of  the  Bill
under discussion. This clause seeks to amend section 81 of the  Correctional
Services Act, Act No 111 of 1998.

In terms of the proposed new subsection (4) of section 81, the  Minister  of
Correctional Services may, in the case  of  unsentenced  prisoners,  release
any such prisoner or group of such prisoners subject to such  conditions  as
may be determined by the Minister with the concurrence of  the  Minister  of
Justice.

The view of the Department of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  is
that clause 30 of the Bill is in conflict with the  doctrine  of  separation
of powers contemplated in the Constitution. It also referred  the  committee
in  its  opinion  to  the  comments  by  the  National  Director  of  Public
Prosecutions. In those comments he expressed strong  reservations  regarding
the effect of this clause should it  become  law.  He  mentioned  that,  for
instance, the following unsentenced prisoners might be  released:  Prisoners
who have been denied bail by the court or in respect of whom bail  is  still
under consideration; prisoners who have committed  serious  crimes  but  who
have been granted bail under strict conditions imposed  by  the  court;  and
prisoners whose cases have been dealt with partly but  in  respect  of  whom
bail has been refused.

He also referred to practical problems which may be created by  the  clause;
for instance the provision does not provide for the  case  when  a  released
prisoner fails to appear in court. Conflicting conditions might  be  imposed
by the Minister and the court, which can create uncertainty.  Prisoners  not
released might wish to appeal against the Minister's decision, and  that  is
not provided for.

He also objected to the provision on the ground that  releasing  unsentenced
prisoners might bring  the  criminal  justice  system  into  disrepute.  The
denial and granting of bail and the setting of bail conditions are  judicial
decisions reached by a judicial officer. Presiding officers and  prosecutors
will experience the proposed provision negatively and this  may  lead  to  a
negative attitude towards that.

Apart from practical problems foreseen by the National  Director  of  Public
Prosecutions, his main of objection, as well as that of  the  Department  of
Justice and  Constitutional  Development,  hinges  on  the  submission  that
clause 30 is in conflict with the doctrine of the separation of powers.  The
Chief State Law Advisers conclude that under  the  current  circumstances  -
and this is after they deal extensively  with  the  current  problems,  also
mentioning the figures of the overpopulation in the  provinces  -  they  are
not convinced that clause 30 violates the  doctrine  of  the  separation  of
powers, and that even if it were to violate the doctrine, they  are  of  the
view  that  addressing  the  plight  of  prisoners,  rather  than  doctrinal
reliance on the strict application of the separation of  powers,  should  be
given preference. They, however, propose a reworded  clause  30  to  address
the  practical  problems  foreseen  by  the  National  Director  of   Public
Prosecutions and also state that as far as clause 30 might be  perceived  as
authorising intrusion upon the powers of the judiciary, the reworded  clause
also addresses the issue.

I am pleased to say that the committee unanimously supported  this  reworded
clause and it is, therefore, proposed that the current clause 30 be  omitted
and  substituted  by  the  reworded  clause,  which  provides  that  certain
prisoners - for instance, where the court has refused to  grant  bail  -  be
excluded from this, and also prisoners who are being detained in respect  of
any offences related to those mentioned in Schedule 2  of  the  Correctional
Services Act. As members know, this schedule refers to crimes  like  murder,
rape and robbery, prisoners being detained in respect of  domestic  violence
as defined in the Domestic Violence Act and, of course, additional  offences
as the Minister may prescribe  by  regulation.  This  reworded  clause  also
addresses the practical problems referred to in the Act.

The overcrowding of prisons - and this is also stated  by  the  Minister  in
his foreword to the annual report which we received just yesterday,  remains
the biggest challenge  for  this  department,  and  it  undermines  all  the
attempts of the department to create circumstances and  conditions  for  the
humane treatment and  rehabilitation  of  prisoners.  It  also  affects  the
morale of personnel very negatively.

The problem, however, is that this is not the  making  of  this  department.
This department receives  prisoners  from  the  Department  of  Justice  and
Constitutional  Development  and  the  awaiting-trial  prisoners  from   the
Department of Safety and Security. We must realise that every time  a  court
hour is lost unnecessarily, and a case is  unnecessarily  postponed  because
of the lack of properly trained and experienced  investigating  officers  or
prosecutors, or the shortage thereof, that brings about  the  problems  that
this department faces.

I think the time has come for us, especially in our  committee,  because  we
are in a position to look at all these  departments,  such  as  Correctional
Services and Safety and Security, as well as Justice,  to  really  sit  down
with them and get to the bottom of this, so that we  can  address  this  for
the long term, because the situation as it is right now, unfortunately,  and
I think the Minister will agree with me, is  intolerable  and  unacceptable.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon  members,  a  lot  has  been
said about the challenges  we  are  facing  in  terms  of  our  correctional
services system. The focus has primarily been,  and  quite  rightly  so,  on
overcrowding, its consequences and possible solutions  to  alleviate  it.  I
want to shift the focus to something that has not enjoyed the same level  of
attention in this debate, but which  is  also  a  very  important  challenge
facing our correctional services system, namely rehabilitation.

Although my contribution will focus on rehabilitation,  I  must  state  that
rehabilitation and overcrowding cannot really  be  seen  in  isolation  from
each other. The lack of rehabilitation can  be  linked  directly  to  prison
overcrowding, because many of the prisoners who are contributing to  it  are
prisoners with previous convictions. Although I do not have  exact  figures,
it is a known fact that the rate at which  prisoners  return  to  prison  is
unacceptably high. This high rate  of  recidivism  means  that  there  is  a
constant flow of people into our prisons which causes  the  overcrowding  we
are currently faced with.

Rehabilitation programmes have the potential to reduce  the  rate  at  which
released prisoners return to prison and,  if  effectively  implemented,  may
help to  reduce  prison  overcrowding.  Rehabilitation  is  defined  as  ``a
process  whereby  a  person's  life  is  restored   to   normality   through
training''. The Correctional Services Act enjoins the department to  provide
prisoners with access to programmes and activities  which  will  meet  their
educational and training  needs  and  assist  in  their  rehabilitation.  In
addition,  the  department  must  also  provide  social  and   psychological
services  in  order  to  support  the  prisoners  to  promote  their  social
functioning and mental health.

At the moment, the department  has  a  number  of  programmes  and  services
available to all sentenced prisoners. These include psychological  services,
social work services, religious  care,  education  and  training  and  other
generic programmes. The psychological and social work services are aimed  at
both the individual groups and families  of  prisoners.  The  education  and
training  programme  involves  Abet,  correspondence  studies,  occupational
skills  training,  vocational  training  and  computer-based  training.  The
generic programmes focus  on  life  skills  training,  HIV/Aids,  drugs  and
substance abuse and sexual behaviour.

A  number  of  services  are  also  available  for  training  awaiting-trial
prisoners such  as  religious  care  and  administrative  support  regarding
distance  education.  With  the  exception  of  social  work  and  religious
services, which are  available  at  all  prisons,  other  services  such  as
psychology,  education  and  training  services  are  available  at  certain
prisons only.

While one can understand that the quality and availability  of  service  are
determined by the availability of resources and the involvement of NGOs  and
infrastructure, every effort should be made to extend these services  to  as
many prisons and prisoners as possible. Apart from making  it  available  in
all prisons, the effectiveness of these programmes must  also  be  assessed,
because it is of little use to have rehabilitation programmes that  are  not
effective at all. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  the  Correctional
Services Amendment Bill deals with a number of technical issues relating  to
definitions in the Act, that is the principal Act, and to procedures in  the
Department of Correctional  Services.  Most  of  these  amendments  are  not
contentious or controversial and consequently, I will not  deal  with  them.
However, section 30 of the Bill does need to be debated.

This  section  provides  that  the  Minister  of  Correctional  Services  in
consultation with the Minister of Justice can release certain categories  of
awaiting-trial prisoners where conditions in prisons are of  such  a  nature
that they demand corrective measures.

At the outset, this needs to be placed in its proper perspective.  There  is
a crisis in respect of the overpopulation in the  prisons  of  the  country.
This is especially critical in  respect  of  awaiting-trial  prisoners.  The
extent of  the  crisis  varies  from  prison  to  prison.  In  some  prisons
overpopulation is slightly more than 100%, and at other  prisons  it  is  as
critical as 300%.

The committee visited prisons  in  different  provinces  to  get  first-hand
information on the crisis. We saw  clear  evidence  of  the  crisis  in  the
prisons that we visited. We  received  reports  from  medical  practitioners
that the overcrowding carried with it certain health risks. A view was  even
reported in the media that there were potential health risks to  communities
outside the prisons.

The situation is such that I do not think anyone will deny that there  is  a
crisis. We have to remember that we are only  talking  about  awaiting-trial
prisoners. We must  also  remember  that  a  substantial  portion  of  these
awaiting-trial prisoners  will  ultimately  be  acquitted  after  a  lengthy
period in prison while their trials were being completed.

Many of these awaiting-trial prisoners had, in fact, been  granted  bail  in
amounts of less than R1 000, but the reality was that they simply could  not
afford to pay such bail. In these  cases,  a  competent  court  has  already
found that such awaiting-trial prisoners  do  not  constitute  a  threat  to
society. A court has also found that such awaiting  trial-prisoners  do  not
constitute an inordinate flight risk, and that they will consequently  stand
their trial.

Yet these people are imprisoned often for many months  because  they  cannot
afford to pay their bail. Hon members must further remember  that  it  costs
the state between R80 and R90 per day to maintain  a  single  prisoner.  The
arithmetic is obvious. The state is simply on a losing wicket  on  this  one
for very little benefit in most instances.

The  problem  is  complicated  by  the  crime  situation  under  which   all
communities suffer. For this  and  other  reasons  certain  safeguards  were
incorporated into the proposed amendment. These safeguards include  that  no
person who has been refused bail by a competent court will  be  released  in
terms of the section under discussion. No person  who  is  alleged  to  have
committed an offence involving violence should be released in terms  of  the
section.

The committee has also made it  clear  to  the  Department  of  Correctional
Services that this amendment should only be  seen  as  a  short-term  safety
valve, and that we are expecting the department  to  develop  an  integrated
strategy as a long-term solution to the crisis. For many  months,  in  fact,
from the beginning of the year, we have  been  pressing  the  department  to
implement again the automated  fingerprinting  system,  the  so-called  Afis
system.

We also pressed the Department of Safety and Security, as  well  as  Justice
to implement the Afis system, together with an integrated docket  management
system.

We  believe  that  these  systems  will  streamline   the   management   and
administration of justice and provide a long-term solution to the crisis  of
overcrowding for awaiting-trial prisoners. We have seen certain  steps,  and
the Minister indicated in his speech that there is progress in this  regard.
We wish the Minister every success in this process and we  want  to  see  it
speedily implemented beyond simply the piloting test phase. [Applause.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, I am just a bit  disappointed  because  a  lot  of
what I have prepared here has already been mentioned.  Nonetheless,  I  will
get to the nitty-gritty.

[Hon Chairperson, Minister of Correctional Services Mr Skosana, hon  members
from provincial governments and hon members present in this House,  I  thank
you.
According to the Correctional Services Act, the Department  of  Correctional
Services should see  to  it  that  conditions  of  prisoners  respect  their
dignity  and  are  acceptable  in  accordance   with   the   South   African
Constitution.

Section 35(2a) of the Constitution stipulates  that  every  prisoner  has  a
right to be allocated accommodation. When we speak of accommodation  we  are
not referring to a place to stay, but to accommodation in the prison.  Every
prisoner must be given food.

After going on a visiting tour of prisons, we found that prisoners  who  eat
to their satisfaction did not experience  any  difficulties  when  going  to
sleep. The Department of Correctional Services sees  to  it  that  prisoners
eat to their satisfaction. Prisoners must be given reading materials,  books
and magazines in order to change their state  of  mind.  They  must  receive
treatment when they fall ill, and all these things must be done  because  if
their  state  of  mind  does  not  change,  they  will  come  back  hardened
criminals.

Allow me to thank them for and congratulate the Department  of  Correctional
Services  on  its  great  task  of  looking  after   and   seeing   to   the
rehabilitation of those who committed offences in respect of  other  people.
The department is doing its best to  teach  them  in  different  spheres  of
education, and through the provision of recreational  facilities  so  as  to
enable them to take part in different  sporting  activities,  and  to  allow
them to rejuvenate their souls. That causes them to change  their  spiritual
state, especially if this is done  by  an  ex-convict,  who,  after  his/her
release from prison, comes back to preach for  prisoners  in  prisons.  They
are taught about health and social life, and given rich  food  in  order  to
build their bodies and minds.

Hon Minister, I would like to go back and speak about food. The  process  of
cooking food for prisoners takes quite some time. They wake up at 4  am  and
start cooking  food  for  prisoners  and  by  six  o'clock  in  the  morning
prisoners must have finished eating and be satisfied. As soon as  they  have
finished eating, vans are waiting to carry them  to  judicial  courts.  This
takes an enormous amount of time.

However, problems still crop up in this department.  We  went  on  a  prison
tour and visited Pollsmoor prison  in  the  Western  Cape,  the  prisons  in
Johannesburg and Pretoria in Gauteng. In the Northern Province,  I  was  one
of the members who was delegated to visit prisons. We visited the  following
prisons:  Potgietersrus,  Pietersburg,  Thohoyandou,   Malamulele,   Tiyani,
Tzaneen,  Ritavi  and  Chief  Muhlava's  kraal,  in   order   to   see   how
administration of the law is done there and  the  type  of  conditions  that
prevailed.

We have realised that the overcrowding of prisons always gives rise  to  the
forming of gangs and gangsterism. There are fights in  prisons.  They  fight
for the utilisation of scarce facilities. Perhaps one may  ask  which  types
of facilities they fight for. They fight for things like  sponge  mattresses
to sleep on at sleeping time. It  is  always  a  case  of  survival  of  the
fittest.

In regard to minor offences, which have  been  discussed  already,  the  hon
kgoshi Mokoena has already deliberated at  length  about  that  and  I  will
therefore not speak about it.

There was one point on our  visiting  tour  of  prisons  which  touched  our
hearts and also that of the hon Minister, and this  is  prisoners  suffering
from terminal illness. When we  visited  the  Johannesburg  prison  we  came
across prisoners suffering from terminal illness, who were just  waiting  to
die. When we asked why such prisoners were not released from jail  in  order
to go and die peacefully at home, the reply was that if a prisoner is  still
awaiting trial and has not been sentenced, the law does  not  allow  such  a
prisoner to be released from jail. These prisoners were in  their  beds,  we
looked at them and could not manage to communicate with them, but  we  could
see that they could die at any time. I do not know if section 30(b)  of  the
Act can be amended to include prisoners awaiting trial to be  released  like
those already sentenced, so that they can go and  die  peacefully  at  their
homes.

Most things have been  done  and  a  lot  is  still  to  be  done.  The  ANC
Government is not resting on its laurels, but has taken it  upon  itself  to
undertake a tour, visiting prisons, in order to communicate with  prisoners,
prison warders and the police. By so doing it enabled us to report  back  to
this House about what is  taking  place  at  this  point  in  time.  We  are
reporting back to the hon the Minister in regard to the  conditions  in  our
prisons. This will, in turn, enable the hon the Minister and  the  officials
of his department to go and rectify some issues.]

In conclusion, gone are the days when the prison system in South Africa  was
internationally condemned for gross human rights violations; when  prisoners
were overcrowded in communal cells - youth  and  adults  kept  together  and
treated in the same way; when prisons  were  characterised  by  militaristic
and racist officials; and when prisons  were  closed  institutions  with  no
media or outside inspection allowed.

Thanks to democracy, our correctional services system upholds the  right  to
human dignity. Offenders  are  being  rehabilitated  because  they  are  the
future and the leaders of tomorrow.

Mr K D S DURR: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister, may I  just  say,  before  I
start, that it was like music to my ears to hear the  Minister  singing  the
praises of the concept of restorative justice, because, I believe,  that  is
the way that we should go and that is the most fertile  field  that  we  can
plough in order to improve circumstances in our prison services.

I wish to focus upon the proposed new section 6(5)(b), where  it  is  stated
that:


  As soon as possible after admission, every prisoner must:


     (b)    ... undergo a health  status  examination,  which  must  include
         testing for contagious and communicable diseases as defined in  the
         Health Act, 1977 (Act No. 63 of 1977), if in  the  opinion  of  the
         medical officer it is necessary to protect or maintain  the  health
         of the prisoners or other persons.

I have read the provisions of the Health Act carefully  and  -  perhaps  the
Minister can help me - my understanding is that this  may  not  cover  Aids,
and the Minister knows that Aids is one of the worst problems that  we  have
in our prisons. I hope he is going to tell me that it does.

I want to give him just one example, in my own constituency,  that  occurred
a few weeks ago. For obvious reasons I will not mention the place  names  or
names of people involved. There was a well-known and middle aged lady  in  a
village, in my constituency, who was recently raped by two youths.  The  two
youths broke into her house and stole liquor and electrical  appliances  and
then brutally raped her.

This person had a tremendous problem: an emotional problem,  as  well  as  a
physical problem. There were some doubts as to whether the  people  who  had
raped her had Aids or not. Her reaction  to  the  AZT  which  she  had  been
advised to take was, for other medical reasons, so severe  that  there  were
doubts as to whether she  would  survive  the  AZT  treatment.  And  so  the
doctors and the lawyers communicated with the police and prison  authorities
to see whether they could have the offenders that had been  arrested  tested
for Aids.

However, the offenders refused to allow themselves to  be  tested.  So  this
woman had this terrible choice of whether to  go  on  or  not.  The  medical
opinion was that if they were negative, they  would  have  stopped  the  AZT
treatment in her particular case, although there  is  a  window  problem,  I
know.

It is not purely of academic interest; it is of tremendous interest that  we
clear this up if, indeed, there is any confusion.

My hon colleagues  Matthee  and  Lever  raised  the  question  of  releasing
unsentenced prisoners  that  are  simply  clogging  up  the  system.  It  is
interesting, if one reads Judge Hannes Fagan's report, that 17 500  suspects
granted bail of as little as R100  could not afford it, and  languished  for
up to 18 months in jail before their cases were heard. I believe  that  even
now that can be alleviated by applications to the courts.  But,  as  my  hon
colleague explained so well, there is an amendment on its  way,  I  believe,
which will put the matter beyond doubt.

That is the situation we have to deal with. There is absolutely no  question
that it is an untenable situation if a man or a woman can be put  in  prison
for a minor offence and then find himself  or  herself  raped  by  an  Aids-
infected prisoner, and then a minor sentence becomes a death sentence.  That
is an untenable situation.

There is also the question of the provisions which allow for the  separation
and testing of prisoners. I would hope that there would be some attempt -  I
believe the Bill allows for this - to separate people who have  been  tested
for HIV.

But of course, there are great cost implications. I would like to  hear  the
hon the Minister's opinion on the testing side and on the administration  of
the whole process, apart from any legal aspects that I may have raised.
I will separate any criticism of the  Minister  from  the  Minister  himself
because I have the highest personal admiration for him and I have known  him
for a long time. But the fact of the matter is that  the  hon  the  Minister
said that a nation is judged by the way it treats its prisoners. I hope  our
nation is not going to be judged by the way we treat our prisoners.

I am not saying that people are not doing their best or  that  the  hon  the
Minister is not doing his best. But, if one reads Dr Craven's report,  which
was put before the Portfolio Committee, or other reports  of  the  situation
in Diepkloof, this is not something we can be proud of. I know that the  hon
the Minister is aware of it and that he is trying to do something about  it.
That is the difference, of course. But the fact of the  matter  is  that  Dr
Craven, when he was briefing the Portfolio Committee in the  Assembly  on  2
October, said of the medical situation in  Pollsmoor  Prison  that  one  was
quite shocked at the alarming state of health, which  could  even  become  a
danger to public health generally.
We have noted that and I am quite sure that the hon  the  Minister  and  his
department have noted that too. We wish him well.

This Bill represents a substantial movement forward. But there  are  matters
that still need to be cleared up, as has been suggested by my colleagues  in
the Other Place in the committee and by  my  hon  colleague  Lever,  on  the
question of awaiting-trial prisoners.

I  think  60%  of  people  in  the  prisons  are,  in  fact,  awaiting-trial
prisoners, but they sit there for up  to  18  months.  It  is  an  untenable
situation, particularly when they are also exposed to health  risks  on  top
of the inconvenience and the problems of privation.
I wish the Minister well. I know he means well. I know he  is  going  to  do
his best. I know that there are improvements on the way.

We support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr T S SETONA: Madam Chair, hon Minister, distinguished officials  from  the
Department of Correctional Services, hon members of this august  House,  for
us  members  of  the  Select  Committee  on  Security   and   Constitutional
Development, the tabling of this amending  Bill  this  afternoon  once  more
confirms the relevance of this House in the national  legislative  processes
of our country.

It will have been noted by members of this House that this  Bill  has  taken
an unusually long period before tabling. I  think  the  Minister  and  other
speakers have referred to that, and why that particular situation  occurred.


This was precipitated  by  the  extraordinarily  careful  consideration  the
committee had to give to the Bill, through consultation  with  all  relevant
stakeholders  and   sharp   contradictions   between   the   Department   of
Correctional Services and  the  Department  of  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development on some aspects of the Bill, which relate to the concurrence  of
authority between the judiciary and the correctional services.
It is worth mentioning that this was indeed not an easy process, but  rather
complex and at times riddled  with  tensions  which  the  committee  had  to
manage before finalising the Bill.

We are proud and confident to say  that  there  were  no  major  contentions
pertaining to the objectives and the overall thrust  of  the  Bill.  We  all
agreed that something must be done to correct the  appalling  conditions  of
overcrowding in our prisons as a matter of urgency.

At the heart  of  the  contention  underpinning  this  Bill  was  the  whole
principle  of  the  separation  of  powers  between  different  branches  of
government in making interventions to address the  inhuman  overcrowding  in
our prisons. The Minister and the chairperson have referred to this point.

Clearly, the question of the conditions of prisoners is not  something  that
we can take for  granted,  but  it  is  a  fundamental  principle  which  is
grounded within our Bill of Rights. In Chapter 2  section  35(2)(e)  of  our
Constitution it is stipulated that:


  Everyone who is detained, including every  sentenced  prisoner,  has  the
  right ... to conditions of  detention  that  are  consistent  with  human
  dignity, including at least exercise and the provision, at state expense,
  of  adequate  accommodation,  nutrition,  reading  material  and  medical
  treatment ...

Given this, it is therefore clear that the Government  has  the  duty,  from
time to time, to ensure that these conditions are adhered to and to  provide
a legislative framework to realise this. It  is  in  this  context  that  we
welcome this Bill, with the  hope  that  it  will  go  a  long  way  towards
addressing the problems under discussion.

In enriching its grasp of the conditions of prisoners, the select  committee
has gone all out to  visit  flashpoint  prisons  in  the  Western  Cape  and
Gauteng. I think some members have mentioned this a well.  We  did  this  to
ensure that we did not rely on statistics that are hyped in the  media,  but
saw for ourselves and also talked to prison management and  prisoners  about
the conditions of prisons.

What transpired from this was not only shocking, but a  gross  violation  of
the supreme law of our country. We witnessed a  situation  where  the  cells
were overpopulated to almost 250-300% levels. The striking feature  of  this
overpopulation  is  that  it  only  affects  the  awaiting-trial  prisoners,
amongst whom some have already spent more than a year in prison.

These appalling levels of overcrowding expose prisoners to  health  hazards,
thus increasing the spread of diseases  amongst  the  prisoners.  They  also
allow  acts  of  sodomy  to  go  undetected  by  prison  officials,  thereby
escalating  the  spread  of  the  scourge  of  HIV/Aids,  which  is  already
spreading at an alarming rate in prisons.

Indeed as a nation and country, we dare not fail to  address  this  problem.
It is our problem, and not the problem of  prisoners  who  are  regarded  as
having caused untold misery to our people and therefore should be  subjected
to inhuman conditions, as some may view it.

It is worth mentioning that the  correctional  system  in  our  country  was
never geared to serve the purpose of rehabilitation.  It  was  a  system  in
which all forms of dehumanisation were meted out against our people.

With the 1994 post-apartheid era, we ought to unite in vision,  purpose  and
deeds to transform this system. The Bill before us this afternoon  is  doing
precisely that.

Some concerns were raised in the course of public hearings  cautioning  that
we may  not  create  a  situation  through  this  Bill  in  which  dangerous
criminals and those that have committed serious crimes get released.

We can assure this House  that  the  Bill  is  straightforward  against  the
following category of awaiting-trial prisoners: those detained  for  murder,
rape, robbery where the wielding of a firearm  was  involved,  assault  with
intent to cause grievous bodily  harm,  assault  of  a  sexual  nature,  and
offences under any law relating to  the  illicit  conveyance  or  supply  of
dependence-producing drugs or  any  conspiracy,  incitement  or  attempt  to
commit any offence referred to in this schedule.

This Bill goes further to  include  domestic  violence  as  defined  in  the
Domestic Violence Act of  1998,  and  such  offences  as  the  Minister  may
prescribe by regulation.

On the question of the separation of powers, we are confident that there  is
no infringement by any branch of Government on  another's  jurisdiction,  as
the principle  of  concurrence  between  the  two  Ministers,  that  is  the
Minister  of  Correctional  Services  and  the  Minister  for  Justice   and
Constitutional Development, is being addressed in the amendment.

The committee is proud to report that regulation, subsequent to  this  Bill,
will address the questions of terminally ill  awaiting-trial  prisoners  who
are currently not allowed to die a decent death at home. I think  that  this
will address the concerns raised by Mrs Nkuna.

Relating to this is  the  issue  of  allowing  awaiting-trial  prisoners  to
attend funerals of their parents and loved ones. Thinking in  terms  of  the
African culture, we are bound to ensure from time to time that our laws  are
consistent with African traditions, norms and customs. We were told that  if
an awaiting-trial prisoner's mother dies,  he  is  not  allowed  to  go  and
observe that ritual. It was our  resolution  at  committee  level,  together
with officials from the department, that as we map out  the  regulation,  we
need to address that particular concern as well.

Allow me to thank members of the opposition for their  display  of  maturity
in  relation  to  this  Bill.  This  has  signified  ...   [Time   expired.]
[Applause.] [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Madam Chair, first, I would  like  to
congratulate  Kgoshi  Mokoena  on  being  appointed  or   elected   as   the
chairperson of the select committee. I think, like his predecessors,  he  is
doing as he said earlier on.

I also  agree  with  him  that  we  are  trying  to  run  one  of  the  best
correctional systems in the region, including some parts  of  the  world.  I
must also admit that the Government's policies  of  transparency  have  also
been used against us, because some of the  things  we  talk  about  and  are
dealing with now, like corruption and mismanagement, are presumed  never  to
have happened in the past. Instead of being used as points in favour of  the
Government policies  and  the  way  they  are  going,  these  phenomena  are
sometimes exploited as points of  weakness.  We  are  trying  to  deal  with
corruption, and therefore we are labelled as  corrupt.  Those  who  did  not
want to deal with it were not corrupt, apparently. We ought  to  be  careful
lest we fall into the trap of simply using the spear against ourselves.

Yes, I agree with Kgoshi that the Bill is of a technical nature  and  it  is
up to us as politicians, managers and administrators to  try  and  implement
those provisions. We will try to implement them.

I remember at some  point  I  used  to  be  lambasted  on  the  question  of
overcrowding and its consequences. After  members  had  visited  prisons  or
seen them in newspapers or on television, they would say that I was  running
five-star hotels. They have moved from this to the  other  extreme  and  are
now claiming that I am ill-treating offenders. So where do I stand with  hon
members?

I am glad that members have shown an interest by  visiting  prisons  to  see
what is happening. Maybe we should also make  provision  for  the  heads  of
prisons, as Mrs Nkuna has suggested, to appear before the  select  committee
so that they can inform members why they are doing some of these things.  We
have about 240 prisons  around  the  country.  Sometimes,  having  seen  the
conditions of  one,  we  tend  to  generalise.  But  we  should  try  to  be
systematic about this and get to those who fall  within  that  bracket  that
members have raised questions about. There are many prisons which  are  well
managed  and  not  overcrowded.  There  are  those   which   are   extremely
overcrowded.

The question of overcrowding and awaiting-trial prisoners is an  issue  that
magistrates and judges are being conscientised about. This is not a  problem
of Correctional Services. It has to do  with  the  sentencing  policies  and
also the attitudes of the magistrates. A member spoke  about  a  14-year-old
fellow who had stolen grapes. If the magistrate  had  co-operated  with  the
head of the prison, he would not have sent this fellow to prison,  but  sent
him for correctional supervision.  So  we  need  this  co-operation  between
these two institutions.
I agree with the hon Mr Matthee that we have dealt with  the  separation  of
powers and I believe that the provisions  in  the  Bill  are  sufficient  to
tackle some of the problems which might flow  from  these  provisions.  This
would then make the Bill unconstitutional. I am satisfied  that  the  select
committee has dealt with this, as the hon member has  suggested.  I  believe
that some of the problems could also be dealt with in terms of the  Criminal
Procedure Act, Act 51 of 1977.

Prince Zulu was right about the consequences of overcrowding. We cannot  run
smooth programmes in rehabilitation once we are overcrowded. As I  mentioned
earlier, this is very difficult to do. I also  agree  with  the  hon  member
when he links rehabilitation with overcrowding.  But  the  matter  of  which
causes which becomes a major question. We should  also  move  on  and  state
that the high rate of recidivism, that is repeat offenders, is also  due  to
the attitude of the public.

The public asks us to rehabilitate prisoners, and when  they  leave,  having
been rehabilitated and equipped  with  skills,  they  are  not  accepted  by
society; they are stigmatised and cannot find  employment.  One  finds  that
society is also hostile towards  former  prisoners.  They  hunt  around  for
employment and when they do not get employed, they remember that  they  used
to get R5 000 hijacking cars but now they are  not  getting  anything.  They
also remember that they used to get three meals a day  in  prison,  so  they
ask themselves: Why am I staying here within this hostile society?

This is not only a prison problem, but a societal problem as well. If we  do
not accept them, they will land in prison again.

The hon Mr Lever was simply emphasising the question of the consultation  of
Ministers. We were satisfied and we will deal with that as Ministers and  we
will  abide  by  those  provisions  in  trying  to  deal  with  question  of
overcrowding. I think the issue of finger printing is now being dealt  with,
within the Department of Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  and  the
police, so it will be coming down to the Correctional Services. We  need  to
have a systematic type of process there.

The hon member Nkuna reiterated the  point  about  prisoners'  rights.  They
need to be treated humanely. The accommodation  ought  to  be  clean,  there
ought to be rehabilitation, recreation and church services. I think we  have
that in place.

The issue of the  terminally  ill  prisoners  has  become  a  monkey  on  my
shoulder now that I have said that I will deal with it. I think  I  need  to
deal with it in a  more  detailed  way,  because  it  also  depends  on  who
certified the person terminally ill.

Doctors  come  from  the  Department  of  Health.  Whether  the  doctor  has
certified that person terminally ill,  that  is  another  question.  If  the
doctor has, then we have to take it from there  ourselves  and  use  certain
processes to relieve the situation. It  is  like  the  question  of  private
hospitals. We do not say that a person or prisoner who is sick should go  to
a private hospital, but when a doctor says that a person is sick and she  or
he must go a certain hospital, that hospital which is  a  private  hospital,
then we have no choice. They do that. We need to deal with  that  situation.
I think it is a very touchy point that has been raised about terminally  ill
prisoners.

I have come across one or two myself where applications were made.  I  think
that we have relieved that stress. We  need  also  the  assistance  and  co-
operation of doctors. Sometimes prisoners  can  be  very  devious.  In  many
cases some of them would be sick. There are regulations, again according  to
which one takes  the  person  to  hospital.  There  must  be  some  security
measures that one applies. If one, say, removes the  shackles  or  handcuffs
in hospital, then the doctor should give that instruction, so  that  he  can
take responsibility.

If doctors do not say that, officials are  also  afraid  just  to  take  the
shackles off the prisoners, because it has happened many a  time  that  they
have done that and the prisoner has escaped. All of a sudden he is  fit  and
healthy, and he  goes.  [Laughter.]  They  are  not  dealing  with  ordinary
people, but with people who are trying to leave the system. For 24  hours  a
day they are also thinking of how to leave the system.

We have prisoners  who  know  constitutional  law  better  than  the  prison
officials. I have  letters  coming  to  me  in  which  prisoners  quote  the
Constitution from A to Z, saying that in terms of this or that section  they
ought to be paroled because of  this  or  that  provision.  They  quote  the
criminal law, and they read it because they do not want to  be  there.  They
want to leave the system. At times they use various devious methods  to  try
to leave the system.

We are moving on with the programme of restorative justice. As  I  said,  we
believe that this is part of the  healing  process  and  the  rehabilitation
process, where a victim can also meet with the perpetrator and try  to  find
out why this happened to her or to him. At times when we consider placing  a
person on parole we think that he  or  she  needs  to  see  the  victim  and
somehow explain why some of these things happened to  her.  Whether  it  was
rape or assault that took place, the  person  who  wants  to  be  placed  on
parole should also be courageous enough to say that he did certain thing  to
the victim and is sorry and admits that he should have not done it. Why  did
he do this to her?

At some point we know that when they are  in  prison  they  have  graduated.
When they are working in a workshop they do get money put  aside  for  them.
Others can even say, ``Look, I have been in prison for so many years  and  I
have saved so much. Now I need  to  redress  the  situation  by  paying  the
school fees for the victim's child for a year.'' It depends  on  the  cases,
but we want to do things like this so that people can reconcile and  restore
faith and confidence in each other. [Time expired.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

                    AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  members,  the  role  of  any
legislature is to  oversee  executive  action  and  not  to  participate  in
executive action.

This is the fundamental principle upon which the doctrine of the  separation
of powers rests. In South Africa, we have  incorporated  this  principle  in
our Constitution, and have made it a requirement for  open,  democratic  and
accountable government. Section 9 of the Agricultural Research Act  of  1990
has  created  a  situation  in  which  this   principle   is   fundamentally
compromised. It has involved the  legislative  arm  in  the  appointment  of
members of the  Agricultural  Research  Council,  which  is  exclusively  an
executive function.

This amendment is  therefore  necessary  to  bring  the  procedure  for  the
appointment of members to the Agricultural Research  Council  in  line  with
the Constitution, and in particular with the principle of the separation  of
powers. Apart from the Constitutional argument, there is another reason  why
I think this amendment should be welcomed.

The Agricultural Research Council plays a very powerful  role  in  terms  of
agricultural research. The council determines the policy and  objectives  of
the ARC. It has control over its functions, the exercise of its  powers  and
the execution of its duties.

Given the powers  of  the  council  in  setting  the  agricultural  research
agenda, how do we ensure that its policy and objectives are aligned  to  the
national agricultural policy and objectives of  our  democratic  government?
This question is of particular importance.

Given the fact that the private farming  sector  in  South  Africa  plays  a
dominant and critical role in  funding  agricultural  research,  how  do  we
ensure that the agricultural agenda is  not  manipulated  by  these  private
financing concerns for their own benefit, but is aimed  at  the  development
of our agricultural sector to the benefit of all South Africans,  especially
the poor and the previously disadvantaged?

This amendment somewhat allays fears, because  the  Minister  is  given  the
power to appoint members to the council who can ensure that the  agriculture
research agenda is not dominated by anybody seeking fulfilment of their  own
commercial  needs,  but  is  rather  set  by  those  who  will  ensure  that
agricultural research benefits the whole country.

Therefore the select committee supports this amending Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Declaration of vote:

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, die Nuwe NP steun die  wysigingswetsontwerp.
[Chairperson, the New NP supports the amending Bill.]

We support  the  Bill.  We  want  to  state  the  fact  that,  although  the
parliamentary process has not been sidelined but changed  through  this,  it
is still important for the department to see to it that  the  committees  be
informed about the decisions and process in due time so that we can  oversee
where we have to.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
             AFFAIRS - SADC REGION SHARED WATERCOURSES PROTOCOL

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, in 1970  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly
advised its International Law Commission to devise  legislation  that  would
govern the management of non-navigable waters.

This legislation would particularly concern  shared  watercourses.  Drafting
was started in 1974 and by 1997 the convention on the law  on  non-navigable
uses of international watercourses was completed.

South Africa ratified this convention in 1998. Because two thirds of  member
states have yet to ratify it, this convention cannot be implemented. Due  to
the high demand for and scarcity of water in the SADC region, the  countries
of this region also sought to manage their shared  watercourses.  This  gave
birth to the protocol on shared watercourse systems in the SADC, and it  was
subsequently signed by member states in August 1995.

This protocol then called for an alignment with  the  UN  convention,  hence
the birth of the revised protocol. The revised protocol aligns the  protocol
with  the  UN  convention,  embracing  the  principle  thereof  and   paying
particular attention to the environmental protection of water resources  and
current ecological concerns while, at  the  same  time,  ensuring  that  the
revised protocol remains a genuine SADC  instrument  which  articulates  the
region's needs.

The protocol was adopted by the Ministers' summit on 7 August 2000.

All the countries of SADC, with the exception of the Democratic Republic  of
Congo, signed the revised protocol, because the late president of  the  DRC,
Laurent Kabila, failed to attend the heads of state  meeting  at  which  the
signing took place. However, the DRC had been part of  all  the  discussions
leading to the protocol.
The overall objective of this protocol is to foster closer co-operation  for
the judicious,  sustainable  and  co-ordinated  management,  protection  and
utilisation of shared  watercourses  and  to  advance  the  SADC  agenda  of
regional integration and poverty alleviation.

In order to achieve this  objective,  the  protocol  seeks  to  promote  and
facilitate the establishment of shared  watercourse  agreements  and  shared
watercourse institutions for  the  management  of  shared  watercourses;  to
advance a sustainable, equitable and reasonable utilisation  of  the  shared
watercourses; to promote the  co-ordinated  and  integrated  environmentally
sound development and management of  shared  watercourses;  to  promote  the
harmonisation and monitoring of legislation and policies  for  planning  the
development, conservation and protection  of  shared  watercourses  and  the
allocation of the resources thereof; and to promote research and  technology
development information and exchange capacity-building  in  the  application
of appropriate technologies in shared watercourse management. All  of  these
objectives are in line with the New Africa Initiative.

The utilisation of a shared  watercourse  in  an  equitable  and  reasonable
manner  requires  taking  into  account  all  the   relevant   factors   and
circumstances, including geographical, hydrological, climatical,  ecological
and other forces of a natural character,  and  the  social,  economical  and
environmental needs of the watercourse states concerned.

The population depends on the shared watercourse in each watercourse  state,
the effects of the use or uses  of  the  shared  watercourse,  existing  and
potential  uses  of   the   watercourse,   the   conservation,   protection,
development and economy of use of the shared watercourse  and  the  cost  of
measures taken to that effect,  and  the  availability  of  alternatives  of
comparable value to a particular planned or existing use.

The protocol was of importance to South Africa. It  sought  to  establish  a
management system for 60% of the water resources that we  are  sharing  with
other countries in the region. At present,  South  Africa  is  sharing  four
waterbasins, namely the Orange, Limpopo, Inkomati and  Maputo  Rivers,  with
our neighbouring countries. These four rivers represent the  most  developed
transboundary watercourses in the region, and in several  cases  the  demand
exceeds the availability of water.

We shall also benefit from the protocol in that we shall  exchange  valuable
information and data regarding the hydrological  and  hydrogeological  water
quality  and  the  meteorological  and  ecological  conditions   of   shared
watercourses.

A number of joint commissions and technical  committees  have  already  been
established to discuss and  negotiate  issues  of  common  interest  and  to
manage the water resources of the different places.

In  conclusion,  as  the  text   of   the   revised   protocol   originates,
substantially, from other international instruments that  South  Africa  has
already  signed,  there  should  be  no  objection  to   its   ratification.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Report adopted in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson,  I  move  the  draft  resolution
printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:

                     BIRTHDAY WISHES TO ARCHBISHOP TUTU

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that, on Sunday 7 October 2001 -


       *    a great South African;
       *    a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize;
       *    a lover of the human race;
       *    a former caddie;
       *    a great humorist;
       *    an opponent of Bantu Education;
       *    a flickering light in the darkness of apartheid;
       *    a stepper on toes of those who preached racial discrimination as
           a political philosophy;

           and


  (2) joins all South Africans and the world community ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Your time has expired.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.] Order! Is there any objection to the motion? [Interjections.]

I must remind members that we have  agreed  time  limits  for  motions,  yet
members consistently prepare motions that  exceed  the  time  that  we  have
agreed. That is unacceptable. In fact,  members  have  gone  so  far  as  to
continue to read a motion even when the Chair indicates that their time  has
ended. I find that unacceptable and I am really not prepared to  agree  that
we conduct ourselves in this way. Could members  ensure  that  they  prepare
their motions in accordance with  the  time  provisions  on  which  we  have
agreed?

We will, Mr Raju, print the motion in full. Members  can  deduce  from  what
was read that it is a motion of congratulation on the occasion of  the  70th
birthday of Archbishop Tutu. I was able to deduce that, and therefore  I  am
sure that hon members would deduce that. Is  there  any  objection  to  that
motion? There is no objection.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     BIRTHDAY WISHES TO ARCHBISHOP TUTU

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council  congratulates  Archbishop  Desmond  Tutu  on  his  70th
  birthday in accordance with his virtues as set out in the kind  words  of
  the hon member Mr Raju.

[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mr Moosa, I am not quite sure what it  is  that
you are attempting to do. We cannot move a motion on the same subject  as  a
motion that has been agreed to by the  House.  I  would  expect  you,  as  a
person who has written many of the Rules that we utilise, to be fully  aware
of that. We will therefore not even consider what you  said  a  few  moments
ago.

              FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT IN PRIVATE SECURITY INDUSTRY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)   Suid-Afrika  'n  reputasie  het  as  'n  land  wat  buitelandse
           beleggings verwelkom en dat vryemarkaktiwiteite bevorder word;


       (b)  die ANC-regering hierdie  reputasie  in  stand  gehou  het  deur
           betyds die vroeëre besluit om buitelandse betrokkenheid in Suid-
           Afrika se privaatsekuriteitsbedryf te verban, te herroep;


  (2) Minister Tshwete bedank dat hy  die  versoek  en  voorstelle  hieroor
       aanvaar het;


  (3) ook die Ministers van Handel en Nywerheid en van Finansies versoek om
       in die toekoms betrokke te raak wanneer besluite geneem word wat Suid-
       Afrika se handelsbetrekkinge kan bedreig en selfs kan vernietig; en


  (4) van mening is dat hierdie ommeswaai illustreer dat opposisiepartye in
       'n werklike demokrasie nie as vyand ervaar hoef te word nie, maar  as
       een van die bene waarop so 'n demokrasie staan.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  South Africa  has  a  reputation  as  a  country  where  foreign
           investments are welcomed and where free  market  activities  are
           promoted; and


       (b)  the ANC Government has lived up to this reputation by  timeously
           revoking the previous decision to  ban  foreign  involvement  in
           South Africa's private security industry;


  (2) thanks Minister Tshwete for accepting the request and  the  proposals
       in this regard;


  (3) also requests the Ministers of Trade and Industry and of  Finance  to
       become involved in future when decisions are made that could threaten
       and even destroy South Africa's trade relations; and


  (4) is of the opinion that this about-turn illustrates  that  in  a  real
       democracy opposition parties need not be experienced  as  the  enemy,
       but as one of the legs on which such a democracy stands.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

3.    Report of the Select Committee on Public Services on Provincial  Visit
     to the Eastern Cape, dated 26 March 2001:


     The Select Committee on Public Services, having visited the Province of
     the Eastern Cape, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         The Committee undertook the visit to deal with  matters  pertaining
         to rural  roads,  poverty  alleviation  projects  and  RDP  housing
         projects. The objective was to  obtain  first-hand  information  on
         progress with provincial roads and houses  engulfed  by  continuous
         floods and tornadoes, and the impact of disaster relief  programmes
         intended to reverse the catastrophe. This in turn  would  help  the
         Committee  to  recommend  what  should  be  done  to   remedy   the
         situation. The decision to undertake the visit, came  as  a  result
         of numerous calls from the different role-players  and  communities
         whose roads  and  houses  had  been  affected  by  the  floods  and
         tornadoes. The visit took place from 26 February to 1 March 2001.


     B.     Eastern Cape


         1. Delegation


              The delegation consisted of Chief M L Mokoena (leader  of  the
              delegation), Messrs M A Sulliman, B J Mkhaliphi and L Suka and
              Ms N D Ntwanambi. Mr M Nguqu (Committee Secretary)  and  Ms  K
              Pasiya (Committee Assistant) accompanied the delegation.


         2. Meeting with EG-Kei District Municipality


              Before the delegation visited communities and  undertook  site
              inspections, they had a meeting with members  of  the  Mayoral
              Committee  of  the  EG-Kei  District  Municipality  under  the
              leadership of Mr M Sogoni. After outlining the purpose of  the
              visit in the region to the  Municipality,  the  following  was
              conveyed to the Committee:


                The Municipality is funded by the  equitable  share  of  the
                national fiscus and other grants  to  construct  new  access
                roads and upgrade existing access roads, and the  proclaimed
                roads become the competency of the provincial Department  of
                Public Works. The Municipality  is  able  to  intervene  and
                construct the proclaimed district roads per arrangement with
                the Department. Since 1998, the EG-Kei Region has  been  hit
                hard  by  floods  every  year,  which   has   caused   rapid
                deterioration of  the  road  infrastructure  throughout  the
                region.


                The provincial Department of Public Works funded  the  roads
                hit by floods in the Mt Ayliff and Tabankulu  area  in  1999
                (an amount of R2,7 million). The Department arranged a plant
                unit with the Drakensberg District Municipality  to  upgrade
                the badly affected roads. The roads included the following:


                * T102 (Mt Ayliff) - 14 km
                * Sipundu Access Road (Mt Ayliff) - 2,5 km
                * Goso Access Road (Mt Ayliff) - 1,3 km
                * T110 (Tabankulu) - 11 km


                The Municipality is involved with site inspections  and  the
                certification of payments to the Drakensberg Plant Unit. The
                work started in August 2000 and is due for completion on  31
                March 2001.


                The national  Department  of  Public  Works  introduced  the
                Emergency  Reconstruction  Programme,   pioneered   by   the
                provincial Department of Public Works, and R12 312  630  was
                made available to  cover  the  former  Wild  Coast  District
                Council Area roads, including:


                * R56 Harding/Umzimkhulu Slip - Umzimkhulu
                * T77 Bridge Approach - Maluti/Mt Fletcher
                * T77 Road to Maluti
                * T005 - Bizana Slip
               * T017 from N2 (Mt Frere) to Cederville
                * T70 to Maluti
                * T11 Rietvlei to KZN (from R56 - T063)
                The  Department  appointed  Boonzaaier  Dotwana   Consulting
                Engineers to manage this allocation  and  monitor  progress.
                The Municipality is involved in monitoring the  progress  of
                these projects.


     C.     Group (on-site) visits


         1. Disaster Housing (27 February 2001)


              Damage assessment was done by  the  Provincial  Department  of
              Housing and Local Government, together with the  Municipality.
              Totally damaged and partially damaged houses were  identified.
              349 houses were totally damaged.  R3,5  million  was  received
              from the Department  of  Housing  and  Local  Government.  The
              balance at the time of the visit was R470 489,76. These  funds
              were transferred to the account of the Municipality.


              The funds for the partially damaged house  were  allocated  to
              the IDT. Of the 349 houses, the IDT built 50  houses.  All  in
              all, 263 houses were complete and 36 under construction.


              During the visit, the delegation managed to cover the Dutyini,
              Spundu and Mnceba areas in the district. The following data is
              based on the areas assessed by the Department of  Housing  and
              Local Government, jointly with the Municipality:


              AFFECTED VILLAGES    HOUSES COMPLETED


              Dutyini  98
              Siphundu 50
              Mnceba   50
              Goso      7
              Luxwesa   4
              Lwandlana       9
              Ngxabaxha      13
              Mbodleni  5
              Shenxa   13
              Lubhalasi       9
              Colana    5


         2. Findings


              The houses were not built up to standard. There was a lack  of
              supervision and monitoring. Builders were only trained  for  a
              period of  four  months  by  the  Department  of  Labour,  and
              thereafter contracted to  build  houses,  without  any  expert
              supervision on  site,  for  the  duration  of  and  after  the
              project. The houses are now dilapidated,  with  sinking  roofs
              and wall cracks.


         3. Disaster Roads (27 February 2001)


              (a) Spundu Access Road (Mt Ayliff): The road was completed  in
                  November 2000, and is still in good condition.


              (b) T110 (Mt Ayliff): The road is under  construction  by  the
                  Drakensberg District Council. On the other end,  the  road
                  joins T109 - also affected by flood  disaster.  A  request
                  was made  to  the  Drakensberg  District  Council  by  the
                  Public Works Department to  extend  construction  work  to
                  this road (T109).


              (c) T15 (from Mt Frere to Mt Fletcher): The road is bladed and
                  not attended to. The Public Works Department  only  reacts
                  when there  is  a  crisis  and  do  the  necessary  gravel
                  patching  to  make  the  road  travellable.  Nevertheless,
                  there is no consistency in maintaining the road properly.


              (d) T100 (Mt Frere) - Lugangeni Amabaca Great Place: The  road
                  is in a very bad condition and the causeway  structure  is
                  badly worn out. The  Royal  Family  of  the  Lugangeni  is
                  located in the  vicinity  of  the  road,  and  failure  to
                  attend the road has earned the Municipality the  wrath  of
                  all traditional leaders, apparently  not  being  sensitive
                  enough and caring enough about the plight  of  the  people
                  living in the area. The road leads to the  largest  school
                  in the district,  Makhawula  School,  which  has  a  state
                  hostel. During heavy rainfall, it is difficult for  people
                  to cross the road and access subsistence products, as  the
                  bridge that links people with providers, is broken.  As  a
                  result, the community remains stranded  for  a  couple  of
                  days until the floods begin to  disappear.  The  road  was
                  classified and prioritised  in  terms  of  the  Community-
                  Based Public Works Programme, but  nothing  has  yet  been
                  done.


              (e) T17 from N2 (Mt Frere) to Cedarville:  The  road  is  only
                  halfway under construction (31 km). It is very bad on  the
                  other side, and additional funding is  required  for  that
                  portion (25 km).


              (f) T454 (Mt Frere), from T017 to Nomkholokotho: The  road  is
                  in a state of disrepair, and bridge approaches  are  being
                  washed  out  because  of  soil  erosion  from  both   ends
                  (floods). Urgent attention is needed.


              (g) T98 Mt Ayliff/Mt Frere to Kokstad  -  (Umzimvubu  District
                  Council): The road is the worst in the  area;  the  EG-Kei
                  District  Municipality  is  doing   patch-gravelling   and
                  repairs. However,  the  interventions  are  not  adequate,
                  despite  the  road  being  prioritised  under  the   Floor
                  Disaster Damage Programme.  The  Ndarala  (Mt  Frere)  and
                  Gogela (Mt Ayliff)  communities  are  separated,  on  both
                  sides of the road, by a fast-running river.  There  is  no
                  bridge for the communities to  cross  over.  Students  and
                  teachers from one side (Gogela) have to  cross  the  river
                  on drums pulled along by  home-made  cables  in  order  to
                  reach school on the  other  side  (Ndarala).  People  from
                  Ndarala do the same to  reach  Gogela  when  traveling  to
                  town. This  arrangement  (known  as  Gankankile)  is  very
                  hazardous and dangerous.
         4. Disaster Roads (28 February 2001)


              (a) Maluti Department of Public Works Camp Site Machinery: The
                  machinery is in a state of disrepair in the camp.  It  had
                  not  been  utilised  for  some  time   (consequential   to
                  personnel having nothing to do  on  a  daily  basis  since
                  1994).


              (b) T69 from Maluti to Lesotho borders: The  Mpotseng  Village
                  is located on this road. The road is  badly  damaged,  but
                  still accessible. Reconstruction of  the  road  is  needed
                  from T12 to  T646.  Continuous  grading  of  the  road  is
                  insufficient because of water retention.


              (c)  T70:  The  Queensmercy  Village,  home  of  Chief  Jeremy
                  Moshoeshoe, is located adjacent to this road. Through  the
                  Disaster  Flood  Damage  Fund,  the  road  is   undergoing
                  construction, and is about to be finished.


              (d) T77 (Mt Frere) from R56 to Lekgatlana: The bridge is under
                  construction, but the road is  not  accessible  from  both
                  ends. At present there is no plan to  construct  the  road
                  on both  ends.  A  A  stream  has  been  opened  to  allow
                  passengers to pass through,  but  this  is  hazardous  and
                  dangerous, and people risk their lives.


              (e) T74 (Mt Fletcher) from R56  to  Tabachi-Cha  Village:  The
                  road is badly  damaged  and  the  bridge  washed  away  by
                  floods. At the moment the road is not attended to  despite
                  being on tender and despite funds made  available  by  the
                  Public Works Department.


              (f) T415 (Shepherds Hope) between T77 and  T74:  It  does  not
                  resemble a road anymore; there are  only  dongas,  and  it
                  needs urgent reconstruction. There is  no  plan  for  this
                  road in the current financial year.  The  road  ("dongas")
                  is supposed to serve as a link  between  Mt  Fletcher  and
                  Maluti.


         5. Disaster Roads (1 March 2001)


              (a) R56 Slip  at  Embuzweni  Village  -  (Umzimkhulu  District
                  Council):  Two  major  slips   are   under   construction.
                  Progress is very slow due to a lack of adequate funds.  In
                  respect of one of the slips, huge amounts  of  tax-payers'
                  money was wasted because the  construction  work  was  not
                  primarily performed properly and the same  contractor  was
                  hired again by the provincial Department of  Public  Works
                  to rework the project at extra costs.


         6. Findings


              There  are  three  Construction  Units  of  the  Public  Works
              Department in the province - Bambisana, Port Alfred and Graaff-
              Reinet -  with  lot  of  good  machinery.  The  Committee  was
              informed that the MEC  responsible  for  transport  and  roads
              committed himself to relocate these units to areas where  they
              are needed most, but up to now nothing has materialised.


              Labour production  is  very  low.  There  is  lack  of  proper
              supervision and monitoring of the  Public  Works  Department's
              personnel. The Committee was informed that the staff clock  in
              late, at 12:00, and knock off at 15:30. Working hours are from
              08:00 to 16:00. During the visit, some of the  employees  were
              found intoxicated during working hours.


              The Public Works Department's machines are  normally  standing
              still, either along the roads or at the house of the Mayor  of
              the Umzimvubu  District  Council,  and  are  not  utilised  as
              intended, on a daily basis. It takes from three weeks  to  one
              month to fix (pump) one single tyre of  a  Grader.  Mechanical
              parts are  removed  at  random  and  transferred  without  any
              supervision and/or audit from senior managers.


         7. Poverty Alleviation Projects (1 March 2001)


              RDP Housing


              (a) Ibisi Pilot Project (30 houses): An amount of R450 000 was
                  received   for   the   construction   of   this   project.
                  Construction started on 15 November 2000 - 15  houses  are
                  completed, the  remaining  15  still  under  construction.
                  Workmanship is up to an acceptable standard. The  trainees
                  are  the  beneficiaries,  and  one  person   (expert)   is
                  employed to look after them.  The  completion  date  aimed
                  for was 31 March 2001.  Of  the  R450  000  state  subsidy
                  grant, R315 000 is used for the  material.  The  remaining
                  R135  000  is  meant  for  infrastructure.  An  amount  of
                  R60 000   was   requested   from   the   EG-Kei   District
                  Municipality to pay for labour. The Department of  Housing
                  approved R15 000 for this project. R10 500  goes  straight
                  to the top structure and  the  remaining  R4  500  to  the
                  basic infrastructure.  There  is  no  electricity,  water,
                  sanitation and/or drainage system in  place.  There  is  a
                  lack of a social service infrastructure - schools,  sports
                  grounds,  health  and  welfare  facilities  and  capacity-
                  building programmes, aimed to lift the standard of  living
                  of the community.


                  Nevertheless, the size of the houses is 40 square metres.


              (b)  Clysdale  Cluster  (at  Umzimkhulu):  The   project   was
                  completed in November 2000. It consists of  a  taxi  rank,
                  washing  bay,  tyre  repairs,  rental  market  stands  and
                  ablution facilities. The project  is  a  complete  fiasco,
                  and is not utilised. The chances of  it  being  a  success
                  are minimal. There is neither water nor  electricity,  and
                  fencing is needed. Consultation between the  Public  Works
                  Department  and  the  local  community  was  not  properly
                  conducted.


              (c) Umzimkhulu Feedlot (at Ebutha Farm): The project has  just
                  started, and is undergoing operational stages.


     D.     Recommendations
         1.  The  Committee  recommends  that  the  national  Department  of
              Transport adopt some of these  provincial  (proclaimed)  roads
              while  the  capacity  of  the  newly   restructured   District
              Municipality is built and/or moulded, in order  to  ultimately
              transfer the function of maintaining the infrastructure  roads
              to the District Municipality and channel funds to the District
              Municipality for implementation.


         2. Resources (be it machinery, personnel  or  finances)  should  be
              transferred to locations where there is  a  greater  need  for
              their utilisation, in order to enhance service delivery.


         3.  There  should  be  proper  planning  in  respect   of   project
              implementation amongst  the  various  cluster  departments  to
              integrate  the  delivery  of  services  (in  line   with   the
              Integrated Development Planning Process).
         4.  There  needs  to  be   proper   departmental   monitoring   and
              supervision of projects in respect of which  Public  Works  is
              expending state resources.


         5.  There  should  be  proper   consultation   between   government
              departments (particularly  Public  Works),  and  beneficiaries
              (whether as individuals or grouped as communities),  and  this
              should form the backbone that influences service  delivery  to
              our people.


     E.     Conclusion


         The visit was a complete success, and it became  evident  that  the
         roads in the region are turning into dongas and that  bridges  were
         being washed away. This  therefore  means  that  urgent  and  quick
         attention is necessary to restore roads in  order  to  improve  the
         lives of our people, particularly the rural and the poorest of  the
         poor.


         Nevertheless, the Committee is satisfied that it had attained  most
         of the objectives of its visit to the Eastern Cape.
