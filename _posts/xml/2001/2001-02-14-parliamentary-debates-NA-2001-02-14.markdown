Mrs N B GXOWA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting

  That the House -


  (1) notes that Nkosi Johnson has been readmitted to hospital;

Mr G B D McINTOSH:


       ... exemplified by -


       (a)  President Mugabe's racial incitement at the most recent Zanu-PF

           in the fight for affordable medicines by withdrawing from the
           court case against the Government; and


       (b)  the hollow remarks by the hon Tony Leon that his party would

           provide just that;


  (2) calls on drug companies to withdraw their morally reprehensible court
       action which is resulting in daily loss of life; and

[Applause.]

Adv A H GAUM: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the resignation of Michael Louis as leader, national chairperson
           and member of the ACDP, because the ACDP did not honour its
           commitment to support the Democratic Alliance in the Boland
           district municipality, but supported the ANC instead; and


       (b)  that this constitutes an enormous credibility crisis for the

[Interjections.]

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the statement by the hon the President that 917 220 hectares of
           land has been handed over since 1994 to 37 396 beneficiaries,
           translating to an average of 24,52 hectares per beneficiary;


       (b)  the hon the President's emphasis on rural development and
           identification of agriculture and tourism as amongst the sectors
           with a potential for higher growth rates, job creation and the
           eradication of poverty; and


       (c)  his concern about the ability of small and medium entrepreneurs
           to access capital; and


  (2) calls upon the Government to -


       (a)  accelerate the identification and distribution of suitable and

           villages, agri-industries, tourism and other enterprises on
           rural revitalisation and stability;


       (c)  inject further capital into the Land Bank, which is leading with
           innovative microfinance packages, to pursue subsidised interest
           rates ...

[Time expired.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! When you started, you said: ``I move''. I assume
that you realise that we are now dealing with notices of motion, and you
did not really mean that you move the motion now.

Mr S ABRAM: I give notice.

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the DA in the Western Cape has gone on a purging spree in
       the Cape Town unicity;


  (2) further notes that the DP accused the ANC government of appointing
       party loyalists in top jobs in government departments, and is now
       trying to defend its own appointment of political stooges in top jobs
       in Cape Town, sacrificing skills and experience for narrow party
       loyalty;


  (3) also notes the unwillingness of the DP and the New NP to escape their
       respective and collective hypocrisy as a tool of political
       expediency; and


  (4) concurs that this kind of hypocrisy, half-truths and misinformation
       is what we can expect with the DA in local government, instead of
       delivery and accountability.

[Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the PAC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  globalisation, which is now a drive to homogenise the world at
           all levels - economically, ideologically, politically and, more
           perniciously, culturally - is not a new phenomenon, but may lead
           to the recolonisation of Africa if its leaders are not vigilant;


       (b)  the view of the PAC is that globalisation is widening the gap
           between the developed and developing nations of Africa in
           particular, the example being that 358 billionaires, mainly in
           Western countries, own more than the combined income of 40% of
           the world's population; and


       (c)  the PAC proposes that those who desire a global humanity must
           struggle to humanise the globe by cancelling the African debt
           and responding to Aids, which is ravaging Africa, and engaging
           the rapid economic industrialisation of Africa, especially by
           sharing more modern technology with Africa; and


  (2) resolves that for Africa the correct response to globilisation is Pan-
       African unity and Pan-Africanism, as Africa cannot participate in
       global affairs without unity,  because otherwise it would be part of
       a partnership where Africans are horses while others are riders.

Dr P W A MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) sy skok en ernstige afkeur uitspreek oor die aanslag wat tans op lede
       van die regbank van Zimbabwe gemaak word;


  (2) voorts die rassistiese optrede van mnr Chenjerai Hunzvi, wat
       doodsdreigemente aan blanke regters insluit, ten sterkste veroordeel;
       en


  (3) sy ernstige kommer uitspreek oor die gevolge van hierdie
       onverantwoordelike optrede vir die demokrasie in Suider-Afrika, en
       derhalwe 'n ernstige beroep op president Mbeki doen om môre, tydens
       sy repliek, sodanige optrede ten sterkste te veroordeel en die
       Regering se standpunt hieroor duidelik te stel.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P W A Mulder: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its shock at and grave disapproval of the onslaught that is
       currently being made against members of the Zimbabwean judiciary;


  (2) furthermore condemns in the strongest possible terms the racist
       actions by Mr Chenjerai Hunzvi, including death threats against white
       judges; and


  (3) expresses its grave concern about the consequences of these
       irresponsible actions for democracy in Southern Africa, and therefore
       earnestly appeals to President Mbeki to condemn such actions in the
       strongest possible terms in his reply tomorrow, and to state clearly
       the Government's position in this regard.]

Mrs Z A KOTA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the reluctance of the DA-controlled Cape Town council,
       otherwise known as the Peter Marais-controlled council, to speed up
       delivery of free water and electricity to the poor communities of the
       Cape Flats;


  (2) further notes that the DA is cutting down security on Cape Flats
       trains, exposing their election pledge of safety for all as yet
       another empty promise;


  (3) concurs that the DA does not have a plan that will ensure delivery of
       even minimum services to all the people; and


  (4) agrees that the DA remains a party for the few, not the many, and
       that the myth of the Western Cape being a model province is exposed
       for what it is.

[Applause.]

Mrs B N SONO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the planned removal of 3 500 residents of Alexandra by the
       Gauteng housing department to Braamfischerville in Soweto and
       Diepsloot;


  (2) further notes that these persons live in grossly inadequate and
       unhealthy circumstances, which make rehousing an imperative;


  (3) considers that there are landless people in Braamfischerville as well
       who feel aggrieved at being placed behind the new arrivals in the
       housing queue;


  (4) requests that the Government give resonance to it's Batho Pele
       principle by transferring so-called ``superfluous state land'', which
       is also readily disposable anyway, to the homeless free of charge on
       a planned ``one household, one plot'' approach with security of
       tenure and rights to land; and


  (5) notes the poor services infrastructure in Braamfischerville, and
       requests that detailed insight be provided to Parliament as to how
       the Gauteng housing department intends addressing the infrastructure
       problem with the planned influx.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move:


  That the House -


  (1) calls on the Minister of Health to -


       (a)  apply for an urgent licence to import generic versions of patent-
           protected medicines for the treatment of HIV and Aids-related
           illness, in order to make cheaper medicines available for
           treatment;


       (b)  withdraw the clause from the Medicines and Related Substances
           Control Amendment Act dealing with parallel importation of
           drugs; and


       (c)  abandon efforts to acquire cheaper Aids medication by allowing
           third parties to import generic equivalents of patent-protected
           medicines, outside of the normal channels of control; and


  (2) notes that the acquisition of such a licence is compliant with the
       law, is justified by urgent need and would respect patent rights.

Mr T M GONIWE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the opportunistic visits by the Deputy Leader of the
       Opposition, Marthinus van Schalkwyk to the graves of our struggle
       heroes;


  (2) believes that these heroes fought for the rights of all South
       Africans, and that all South Africans should honour these heroes of
       our liberation;


  (3) urges Mr Van Schalkwyk, in future, to show more respect and
       sensitivity for the memories of our heroes by conducting his visits
       with humility and without the attendant glare of publicity; and


  (4) calls on Mr Van Schalkwyk to show his true remorse at the behaviour
       of his political forebears by signing the ``Declaration of Commitment
       by White South Africans''.

[Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  40% of businesses canvassed in a survey by the British Chamber
           of Business in South Africa are leaving their options open as
           regards leaving South Africa for personal reasons;


       (b)  16% have indicated that their business could disinvest; and


       (c)  the participants were particularly concerned about the inability
           of the SA Government to combat crime, violence and corruption;


  (2) urges the Government to reassess its priorities and admit that crime
       is hurting our economy and harming our people; and


  (3) further urges the Minister of Safety and Security to focus his energy
       on curbing crime in South Africa, and not to make irresponsible
       statements to victims of crime.

Mr M E MABETA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:
  That the House, in keeping with accepted international norms in all
  democracies in which the independence of the judiciary is recognised and
  respected, and in keeping with our own constitutional principles on the
  separation of powers and the recognition of the role and integrity of the
  judiciary; urges our Government to avoid a situation such as the one in
  Zimbabwe where judges are forced to resign from the High Court if they
  disagree with the executive.

Mr R K SEPTEMBER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the racist stand taken by DA councillor Ian Iverson  in the
       city of Cape Town to restrict the use of the Newlands rugby and
       cricket grounds to exclude soccer matches;


  (2) also notes that soccer is a well-loved sport among the Cape Flats
       communities, and that the PSL also needs proper facilities and solid
       revenue;
  (3) concurs that the DA's inherent racism, incompatible alliance and
       unfair historical bias to minority privileges rob the people of Cape
       Town and South Africans in general of fairness, equity and a better
       life for all; and


  (4) calls on Tony Leon, or whoever is in control of the misguided
       missiles of the DA, to expel the racists.

[Applause.]

                             GUJARAT EARTHQUAKE

       (a)  the terrible earthquake that occurred in India a few weeks ago,
           destroying lives and property and causing pain to the people of
           India; and


       (b)  that rescue workers from all over the world, including South
           Africa, were dispatched to help those that sustained injury in
           this terrible disaster;


  (2) expresses heartfelt condolences to those who lost their loved ones;
       and


  (3) extends its sympathies to the government and people of India.

                             PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS

              (Resumption of Debate on Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, Mr President, Deputy
President, hon members and all protocol observed, today all of us, by our
presence and by our celebration in other parts of our country and the
world, confer glory on and give hope to new-born liberty. Out of the
experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be
born a society of which all humanity will be proud.

Our daily deeds as ordinary South Africa must produce an actual South
African reality that will reinforce humanity's belief in justice,
strengthen its confidence in the nobility of the human soul and sustain all
our hopes for a glorious life for all. All this we owe both to ourselves
and to the peoples of the world who are so well represented here today.

I wonder how many of us still remember when, where and by whom these words
were uttered? I do hope that we all remember. If we do not, let me put hon
members out of their misery. These words were uttered by former President
Mandela as he ushered in a new South Africa.

How many of us in our daily deeds, as ordinary South Africans and as hon
members of this House, are true to those words? We all have to answer this
question frankly and honestly. More importantly, we indeed have to act in
the way that former President Mandela articulated. If we do not, we are
betraying our country and humanity.

This new-born liberty came with expectations, responsibilities and
obligations. I will deal with some of them, especially those pertaining to
the region, the continent and the world. It is expected, and indeed
correct, that we must discharge our responsibilities and participate in the
life and development of our regional and continental organisations.

As many hon members are aware, the health of SADC is of critical importance
to us as a country, as it has a direct impact on our future, just as it
does in regard to all the other member states. It is thus in our collective
interest to raise and attempt to answer some pertinent questions on SADC.
The past few years have been a difficult and trying time for the
organisation. Recognising this, member states have undertaken a
comprehensive review of the mandate and operations of the various SADC
structures. This review was managed by a review committee which comprised
Namibia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa. The review
committee is all the more critical, given that other regional organisations
such as ECOWAS have overtaken us in terms of the rationalisation and
integration process.

To this end, the review committee has come up with recommendations for
reforming the organisation. Early in March, there will be an extraordinary
summit of heads of state and governments to look at the recommendations, so
as to conclude the discussion phase and start the actual implementation of
the reforms. SADC has to be geared for the new challenges and the fast-
changing world.

With regard to the OAU, we have already made significant progress towards
the reform of the organisation. This reform was necessitated by the
organisations with institutional resources and capacity, which diminish its
ability to execute its various mandates properly. A good example of this is
the fact that its response to potential conflicts is hampered by the
absence of an early warning system and adequate capacity for peace building
and peacekeeping.

To address these and other related issues, it was decided to accelerate the
implementation of the Abuja Treaty and the establishment of the African
Union. This entails the establishment of institutions such as the African
Monetary Union, the African Court of Justice and the Pan-African
Parliament. Although the Pan-African Parliament will only initially have
advisory powers, it is very important because for the first time in African
history it will provide legislative representatives from all member states
with a forum in which they can air their views and hold consultations.
Additionally, it provides that by consensus in the summit, the African
Union can intervene in the internal affairs of member states in respect of
war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. Conversely, it also
provides that member states can request the intervention of the African
Union to restore peace and stability in their individual states. Flowing
from this, it is very clear that the African Union also has to participate
in the economic life of the continent. The African Union does provide those
structures which will look at development in the various member states.

In addition to that, the OAU mandated Presidents Mbeki and Phuthaflika to
deal with the debt burden in Africa, and the South Summit mandated both of
them, together with President Obasanjo, to engage the G8 leaders on the eve
of their summit in Okinawa, convey the concerns of the South and develop a
constructive partnership with the North for the regeneration of the African
continent. As a result and in recognition of the fact that it should be the
architect of its own regeneration, these African leaders are formulating a
strategy programme for the renewal of our continent. A programme which
members heard the President refer to as MARP in his speech.

The Millennium African Recovery Programme is a commitment by African
leaders, both individually and collectively, to place Africa firmly on the
path towards sustainable growth and development. MARP speaks of an Africa
which seeks to engage the world at large in a constructive partnership for
mutual benefit and not from a position of dependency. It further requires
this not just among Africans, but also invites industrialised countries and
multilateral institutions to join the initiative. This must be based on a
binding commitment to an agreed set of obligations with accompanying
milestones and timeframes.

As Africans we are already reaping some of the benefits of structured
relationships with other organisations and institutions such as the
European Union, the Nordic countries, China, Japan, the USA, France and
others. In this regard, the Summit of the South was an important event in
preparing for the Millennium Summit. Important decisions were made at the
South Summit which were carried to the Millennium Summit. The outcome of
that Millennium Summit - in the form of the millennium declaration - offers
further opportunities to advance and solutions for creating better wealth
for all humanity. But it also recognises that Africa is a special challenge
for the rest of the world.

Another important obligation is our participation in the United Nations and
all related structures. We all know that the UN was established when its
membership was very small and in a different environment. The present
realities, however, are not reflected in the structures and the decision-
making processes. In this regard it is important to call for and support
the reform of the United Nations Security Council and Bretton Woods
institutions, including the World Trade Organisation.

Similarly, there is an urgent need to reform the international financial
architect. Bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank are undemocratic and not responsive to the needs of the developing
world. However, the restructuring process is hampered not only by technical
and conceptual problems, but by political constraints and conflicts of
interest.

South Africa is an important player in the reform of all these
organisations. Different Ministers are members of different committees and
participate in reforming these organisations. But South Africa is also
recognised as an important player and, therefore, has been asked to host a
number of conferences between now and next year. One of those conferences
is the Un Conference on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and
Related Intolerance. It is indeed appropriate that this conference is to be
held on the African continent, because it was on this continent that major
struggles against racism were waged and won, even though not completely.
Therefore, it will be necessary for us as South Africans to reflect on what
we want the outcome of this conference to be.

The World Summit on Sustainable Development and the Johannesburg Earth
Summit in the Year 2002, will provide an important opportunity for the
entire world to review and assess progress achieved to date in the
implementation of the outcome of the Rio Summit. It will also commit us to
explore and find a balance between economic and social development, and
environmental protection. As one can see, these issues are especially
relevant to South Africa, Africa and the entire developing world.

In June next year South Africa will also host the Organisation of African
Unity Summit and from June this year we will be part of a troika of the
OAU. South Africa also plays a major role in the Nonaligned Movement, the
G77 and the Commonwealth. Our President, as we know, has been tasked with
dealing with the reforms of the Commonwealth. It is therefore evident that
South Africa is seen as a major player in the international arena. The high
regard in which we are held internationally is appropriate recognition of
our people's achievements.

As recently as 10 years ago South Africa was regarded as a pariah state.
Today we are a vibrant player in the region, in the continent and in the
world, holding and exercising a number of critical obligations and
responsibilities. Given this, I find it extremely puzzling that there have
been complaints from some quarters at home that the President spends too
much time travelling abroad.

It is difficult to imagine how we can discharge these responsibilities and
obligations without him ever leaving the country. The President of a
liberated South Africa has to fulfil his international obligations. He
cannot stay at home and marginalise our country in a world which is so
integrated. In a century of globalisation, who wants a President who does
not command respect in the global village? [Interjections.] The previous
presidents did not travel, because no one wanted their participation.
Apartheid South Africa had nothing to offer to the region except misery,
death and destruction.

The President does us proud as a South African head of state.  His
commitment, not only to the people of South Africa and the African
continent, but to humanity is commendable. I can assure him that ordinary
South African citizens who love humanity, both black and white, support
him. Let me also say that in all his travels he must please be assured that
my department and our diplomatic missions abroad stand ready to receive him
and to provide him with all the support and assistance he requires. I
therefore invite him to consider us his home away from home. [Applause.]

Gen C L VILJOEN: Madam Speaker, Mr President, Mr Deputy President and
members, I would like to react to the previous speaker by saying that we
all agree that Africa is a challenge. But I do not think that it is a
challenge for the rest of the world. Africa is, firstly, our challenge and
also that of the President of our Republic.

Die algemene reaksie op die openingsrede van die President behoort vir hom
'n aanduiding te wees van hoe die mense van hierdie land na positiewe
leiding en toekomsgerigtheid smag. Almal is moeg om van die retoriek van
die verlede te hoor. Die eerste paar minute van die toespraak was vir my
neerdrukkend toe woorde soos ``fateful past'' en 'n konferensie oor
rassisme weer geopper is. Aan die einde van die toespraak het ek my die
vraag afgevra of die ``unity in action for change'' van die President die
regte oproep was. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The general reaction to the opening address of the President should be an
indication to him of how much the people of this country are yearning for
positive guidance and looking towards the future. Everyone is tired of
hearing the rhetoric of the past. The first few minutes of the speech I
found depressing, when words such as ``fateful past'' and a conference on
racism were mentioned again. At the end of the speech I asked myself
whether the President's ``unity in action for change'' was the right call.]

Instead, the President should have called for ``unity in action for
development''. That is what we all should unite for: peace, prosperity and
happiness for all. The negativity of a mood of uncertainty will be
addressed by the President once he shows the way for the country as a
whole, and not for a section only.

There is no doubt that the view of the President on the importance of the
microeconomy, particularly, is correct. There is no doubt that the creation
of jobs, liberating the economy, investment in infrastructure, integrated
rural development, urban renewal as well as incentives for export are
priorities.

However, I want to send a warning on two issues. Firstly, available
investment should be directed at the productive sectors, and not at social
spending. Even the infrastructure improvement should be prioritised to
ensure maximum job creation and growth. Secondly, when the President speaks
of Government intervention or regulatory actions in the economy, we need to
be careful. The FF favours the concept of free enterprise and as little
intervention as possible by the Government.

It is the primary function of a government in any country to foster the
right climate for growth. This can be done by creating confidence for
development and investment, ensuring stability, caring for infrastructure,
providing incentives, lowering input costs, which impacts on the labour
laws, training and developing human resources, and creating a culture of
saving and work, instead of the weekly madness of spending food money on
lotto tickets. No matter in how detailed a manner the Government plans,
regulates or intervenes, if the climate is not suitable economic growth
will evade us.

In all humility I wish to point out certain factors affecting the climate
for growth in our country. Firstly, with regard to the President's
management style, he should, in my opinion, spend more time internally and
visit the priority departments which are vital to the achievement of the
broad outline of his policy speech. The hopes created in his speech can
only be achieved by a style of decentralised management, and objectives
which have been jointly decided upon by the President and his senior
Ministers.

Secondly, we have to deal with the very important objective of the African
Renaissance. This task, which we all accept to be a high priority to the
President, is of far greater magnitude than is generally admitted. The
President, together with his colleagues in Africa, could have created the
best broad plan, but should have delegated the more detailed work of that
plan to special envoys, working as teams, to interact as widely as
necessary in Africa.

Thirdly, there is the question of crime. Apart from mentioning the
commitment to pay attention to crime, the President does not seem, to me,
to be particularly concerned about this situation. He has not even
mentioned the farm murderers, and has not indicated any special effort to
deal with this cancer. Now that the country has the new powerful local
government structures, a possible way of dealing with this ever-increasing
problem is to decentralise those functions, which can best be dealt with at
a decentralised level involving the whole community in combating crime.

Die vierde saak wat die klimaat om groei te bevorder nadelig beïnvloed, is
die persepsie by minderheidsgroepe dat die meerderheid die politieke mag
bekom het en dit net tot voordeel van die meerderheid aanwend, soos ook die
Portugese gemeenskap tans ervaar. Dit ondermyn die lojaliteit en die
patriotisme van die minderheidsgroepe teenoor die groter geheel van ons
staat. Dit lei tot polarisasie.

Vyf jaar lank is die kommissie belas met die regte van minderheidsgroepe
jaar ná jaar uitgestel. Die President het dit nie eens nodig geag om
vanjaar in sy openingsrede te verwys na hierdie belangrike uitstaande
aangeleentheid nie, en hy verseg verder om met die VF te onderhandel oor
die billike, internasionaal aanvaarde toepassing van selfbeskikking soos
dit in ons Grondwet vervat is.

Die Regering se onlangse weiering om die gemeenskap van Orania se eenparige
versoek vir billike gemeenskapselfbeskikking op die vlak van plaaslike
regering te handhaaf is 'n verdere aanduiding dat die President en sy
Regering die rug gedraai het op minderheidsgroepe se regte, en verwag dat
minderheidsgroepe vrywillig sal saamsmelt met die meerderheid. Dit is die
pad van konflik en vervreemding. Dieselfde geld vir behoeftes om ons
tradisionele leiers van etnokulturele gemeenskappe 'n waardige plek in die
son van ons demokrasie te gee.

Die nalating om te verwys na die uiters ernstige toestand van die
kommersiële landbousektor bevestig vir my die persepsie dat die Regering
landbou-onvriendelik is. As boerderywins in vyf jaar met 44% daal,
brutowins in een boekjaar - 1998-99 - met 43% daal en grondwaardes sedert
die boekjaar 1996-97 met 40% afgeneem het, sou 'n mens verwag dat hierdie
strategiese bedryf in die openingsrede genoem sal word.
Laastens raak die Heath-sage die klimaat in ons land negatief. My nederige
advies sou wees dat dit nie te laat is om die fout reg te stel nie. Die
regter kan uitgelaat word as hy die probleem is, maar sy eenheid behoort
toegelaat te word om die saak saam met die ander liggame te ondersoek. Dit
sal die regte klimaat vir 'n anti-korrupsiegevoel in die land skep.

Die President het hoop geskep met 'n nuwe gees in sy toespraak, maar die
klimaat in die land is nog droog. Ons kort reën. Groei is afhanklik van die
regte grond en klimaat. Suid-Afrika is 'n land van diversiteit. Dit is soos
die President gesê het, daar is miljoene sigbare en onsigbare bande wat die
dele aan mekaar vasbind, maar patriotisme en nasionale eenheid sal net in
die regte klimaat van verdraagsaamheid blom om die vrugte vir veral
ekonomiese groei te lewer. Dit is ons almal se uitdaging. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The fourth issue that is detrimentally affecting the climate for growth is
the perception among minority groups that the majority gained political
power and is using it to the benefit of the majority only, as the Portugese
community is at present experiencing. This undermines the loyalty and
patriotism of the minority groups towards the greater whole of our state.
This leads to polarisation.

For five years the commission entrusted with the rights of minority groups
has been postponed year after year. The President did not even deem it
necessary to make reference to this important outstanding issue in his
opening address this year, and he also flatly refuses to negotiate with the
FF in respect of the fair, internationally accepted implementation of self-
determination as contained in our Constitution.

The Government's recent refusal to uphold the unanimous request by the
community of Orania for community self-determination at the local
government level is a further indication that the President and his
Government have turned their back on the rights of minority groups, and
expect minority groups to merge with the majority voluntarily. This is the
path to conflict and alienation. The same applies to the need to afford our
traditional leaders of ethno-cultural communities a worthy place in the sun
of our democracy.

The failure to mention the extremely serious state of the commercial
agricultural sector confirms to me the perception that the Government is
agriculture unfriendly. If farming profits decline by 44% in the space of
five years, gross profits decline by 43% in one financial year - 1998-99 -
and land values  have declined by 40% since the 1996-97 financial year, one
would expect this strategic industry to be mentioned in the opening
address.

Lastly the Heath saga is having a negative effect on the climate in our
country. My humble advice would be that it is not yet too late to rectify
the error. The judge may be left out if he is the problem, but his unit
should be allowed to investigate the matter together with the other bodies.
This will create the right climate for an anti-corruption feeling in the
country.

The President gave hope with a new spirit in his address, but the climate
in the country is still dry. We need rain. Growth depends on the right soil
and climate. South Africa is a country of diversity. It is as the President
said, there are millions of visible and invisible ties that bind the parts
to one another, but patriotism and national unity will only flourish in the
right climate of tolerance in order for us to reap the fruits of economic
growth in particular. This is the challenge facing all of us.]

Dr Z P JORDAN: Madam Speaker, Comrade President, Deputy President, hon
members, comrades and colleagues, ``I was merely following orders.'' That
was the gravamen of the defence Adolph Eichman proffered to an Israeli
court, to explain the despicable acts of genocide he, his political masters
and his underlings had perpetrated throughout occupied Europe. The coin of
this terrifyingly banal excuse has been repeatedly cast before the jury of
world opinion as if the plea of obedience, in itself, should be sufficient
to justify acts of torture, rape, mayhem and mass killings.

Is it presumptuous to assume that, when a South African politician honours
the memory of Mahatma Gandhi, Chief Albert Luthuli and the Cradock Four, by
token of such actions, he is also denouncing those who threw Gandhi off a
train, persecuted and proscribed Chief Albert Luthuli, and ordered the
murder of Matthew Goniwe and his three comrades? Each one of the people
involved in these oppressive acts, which range from the detestable to the
outrageous, was indeed carrying out orders.
Regarded in that light, it is eminently comprehensible why the people who
have made a difference in human affairs have invariably been those who were
prepared to be disobedient. According to the ancient Greeks, it was an act
of gross disobedience, but it was Prometheus's theft that emancipated
humanity from the darkness and cold by bringing us fire.

During the 20th century, Gandhi evolved the tactic of mass civil
disobedience as the instrument with which to free India from colonial
bondage. Under the leadership of Luthuli, Dadoo and the personal command of
Nelson Mandela, 8 000 disciplined volunteers spurred on the movement for
change by deliberately defying a number of unjust apartheid laws after 26
June 1952. The Cradock Four, too, had mobilised their communities to break
the unjust apartheid laws so as to make that system unworkable.

I must confess to having some sympathy for the hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk.
It would be mean-spirited and petty to mock and dismiss highly symbolic
acts of reconciliation. Who could reasonably oppose the leader of the New
NP embracing and honouring the heroes and martyrs of the struggle for
liberation? I will wager, though I am not a betting man, that all the
persons implicated in and responsible for the vile actions which the hon
Van Schalkwyk, by his symbolic actions, was repudiating and castigating,
would also have pleaded that they were merely following orders.

After our national conference on racism last year, the authoress, Antjie
Krog, initiated the ``Home for All'' campaign. That initiative is but a
moment in a powerful but little recognised tradition of antiracism and
democratic striving amongst our white compatriots. For too long, white
antiracists have numbered a small, often isolated, minority among the white
community. For their convictions, many suffered opprobrium and ostracism,
even from their own families. These, too, were men and women who refused to
be compliant. They would not go along with, let alone support, a racist
system. It is a matter of profound regret that the attitude adopted by the
leading figures in the Official Opposition has, once again, conspired to
reduce these courageous whites to a tiny minority.

During the second half of this year, South Africa will be hosting the UN
Conference on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related
Intolerance. Given South Africa's recent history and the relatively
peaceful transfer of power from a racial oligarchy to a democratic
majority, the participants, drawn from every quarter of the world, will
arrive here with great expectations of South Africa. Amongst these is the
expectation that here in our country, they will be able to witness a shared
national commitment to ending racism and its legacy.

Though many a bitter truth will be pronounced during the course of this
conference, it is not a conference intended to target any particular race,
group of nations, religious community or region of the world. This will be
a conference inspired by the recognition that the machete-wielding mass
killer in central Africa is as reprehensible as the nightriding Ku Klux
Klansman who kills in a pack and shoots in the back. It will pillory the
Brooklyn-bred West Bank settler who crushes a Palestinian boy's ribcage
with a rifle butt with the same vigour that it denounces the National Front
yobbo who bombs the homes of his neighbours merely because they come from
the Indian subcontinent.

This is a conference that should cast an unsparing light also on the demons
that drive a Sudanese of Arabic descent to employ chemical agents against
his Nubian compatriot. It must also assist us to grasp the full extent of
the racist terror unleashed on Amerindian communities in the rain forests
of South America by those who hope to profit from their misery. It will
demonstrate, unfortunately, that racism is an international phenomenon, but
a phenomenon which is no less shameful because of its universality. We
should all emerge from that conference with a new determination to finally
close this gruesome chapter in the history of humanity.

Xenophobia is sometimes lightly dismissed as excessive ethnocentricism.
This intolerance of perceived outsiders is neither negligible nor benign.
We should congratulate our Government on its decision to revisit our own
immigration laws, both as a means of combating xenophobia and to enhance
South Africa's capacity to attract and retain the skills and services of
talented people from every part of the world. I am persuaded that
nationalism in every country requires a strong admixture of
internationalism to prevent it from becoming a stupefying drug.

Africa and its wellbeing remains the central thrust of South African
foreign policy. Those whose ill-concealed racial angst persuade them to
advocate South Africa distancing itself from the rest of the continent
would do well to recognise the degree to which the success of many of our
local industries and South African commerce is dependent on Africa.

South African self-interest dictates that we make Africa a success story.
That must translate into continued efforts to stimulate sustainable
economic growth and development on our continent. The sine qua non for that
is peace. Regrettably, peace can sometimes only be achieved by the
judicious application of force. Three years ago that was the situation in
Lesotho. Perhaps before recklessly denouncing strategic arms procurements
as wasteful, critics should ponder what the outcome would have been had the
SADC countries not been in a position to intervene in that Lesotho crisis.

The states of Africa and the rest of the world have thrust upon South
Africa the responsibility of taking the lead in a number of thorny
regional, continental and international problems. That alone testifies to
the under-acknowledged achievements of South African diplomacy since 1994.
In order to successfully pursue that role, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs
has wisely chosen the path of engagement, persuasion and measured
encouragement, rather than the presumptuous hectoring, finger-wagging and
bullying advocated by some.

Here at home our obligations to our country and our people demand that we
make a national commitment to eradicate the degrading poverty that afflicts
far too many of our people. We invite the opposition to join us in that
endeavour, something we embraced a long time ago. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, President, Deputy President and hon
members, let me congratulate His Excellency the President on a pithy and
down-to-earth state of the nation address last week.

The address has reassured the nation on some issues while, on the other
hand, it has brought to light that much still has to be done in order to
make South Africa in which all have a place in the sun. We welcome the fact
that outgoing office-bearers of the defunct municipalities have to be
investigated, so that the innocent are not lumped with the wrongdoers. The
latter should face the music for their misdeeds. On this score, however,
the UCDP would like to see this happening even with regard to outgoing
provincial governments. Each premier who steps down must have his or her
administration investigated, to enable the new head to start with a clean
slate.

The often reported infighting amongst members of the SA Police Service is a
cause for concern. The matter is exacerbated by the latest racist reports
on the VIP unit. This situation cannot be allowed to recur, as these
officers are charged with providing safety and security to Government
leaders. Whatever discontent exists or is perceived amongst security
officers has to be addressed without delay.

We are aware that the Department of Correctional Services will take a long
time to rid itself of the ugly image of the past, and we welcome the
envisaged revamping of the department as announced by the President. In
fact, we look forward to the purge on all stalkborers in Government
departments.

The state of the nation address is meant to give direction to the nation.
If the President sets the pace by leaping forward, no one should be seen to
be walking sideways like a crab, as often happens. The President takes out
the olive branch and becomes conciliatory in his presentation, and then
some members of the majority party display how unforgiving they are.

The recent local government elections have been declared free and fair by
the IEC. The freeness and fairness are based on probabilities and balances.
There have been instances of serious breaches of the electoral code
elsewhere. Charges were laid against two ANC premiers in the run-up to the
election, and to us the outcome is immaterial. All we say is that leaders
in such offices must be beyond reproach in such matters.

If a provincial premier causes a commotion at the voting station on
election day - as was the case in Dinokana, Zeerust, where he tampered with
the lights, resulting in the polling station being thrown into darkness for
a while - it can hardly be said that the elections were free and fair.
[Interjections.] This may sound like water under the bridge, but there are
indications that elsewhere in this country some people in authority will
have nothing to do with the President's plea that the nation should unite
in action.
In an effort to reduce the abject poverty of our people living on the
periphery of the cities, labour-intensive jobs have to be created by the
community-based employment programmes through the Department of Public
Works. Local people could be tasked with repairing the roads and be
remunerated. This will, on the one hand, create jobs, albeit temporarily,
and will, on the other, bring relief to the destitute by allowing them to
earn a living. Petty crimes such as theft and burglary could be reduced in
this way.

Since steps have been taken to increase the number of flights into and out
of South Africa, as reported by the President, to assist with the promotion
of tourism, we trust that this exercise will help increase domestic flights
too. Assistance has to be given to the Northern Province to ensure that the
Gateway Airport, which has been dogged by administrative and, reportedly,
financial problems, is developed and completed. Flights between Mmabatho
Airport and other parts of the country, particularly those to and from
Johannesburg, should be reinstated. Tourism will be greatly enhanced with
the upgrading of domestic flights.

While the cumulative figure for the supply of clean water provided through
the community supply programme has increased, the initial 200 metre
distance per stand pipe, as promised, has still to be realised. As a result
of the Government's failure to live up to expectations, people resort to
making illegal connections to their homes. This results in those who had
water being left high and dry. However, on this score we need to thank hon
Minister Kasrils, who is attending to this issue quite well. We maintain
that the nation has to be imbued with a spirit of taking pride in what they
have.

The intended facelift of Alexandra township is welcome. This is one of the
pilot projects which are being launched. The renewal of the place has to be
carried out, however, in a dignified and humane manner, as opposed to what
we saw on national TV last night. One would be forgiven for thinking that
the days of Sophiatown and Lady Selbourne had returned. We hope that in the
next turn Winterveldt, which is also one of the high crime areas, will, as
the President promised, also be given the nod for upgrading.

The review of immigration laws and procedures is long overdue. We hope that
the exercise will be attended to urgently and will not be allowed to
degenerate into a protracted exchange of communications between the
Ministry and the portfolio committee chair, as has been the case so far.
Let us lower the flag, yet retain and maintain standards, and thus make
room for investors, which will have sound economic spin-offs for our
people.

Finally, the time has come for all of us in this country to unite around
issues that will make our country prosper. Differences in political outlook
should not result in some people being perceived as less patriotic. We
should, as our national anthem states, answer the call to come together and
stand united as we strive for freedom in South Africa, our land.

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker,
Zizi, Jama-Sijadu, Nxamalala, Msholozi, colleagues, hon members, in his
state of the nation speech last Friday and in many other speeches before
that, the President of the Republic committed himself and his government to
the further intensification of the fight against the scourge of corruption
that confronts our nascent democracy.

As a country, we have adopted a number of legislative measures and embarked
upon a series of activities to address the problem of corruption,
particularly in the Public Service, and to ensure that integrity, good
governance and transparency are promoted in the public sector as well as in
civil society in general. We have, for example, held several high-profile
domestic seminars and workshops. In October 1999 we even co-hosted an
international conference on corruption which the President was kind enough
to open for us. Of even greater significance is the fact that we now have a
whole panoply of pieces of legislation aimed at reducing fraud and
particular forms of misconduct relating to bribery and corruption.

These include the Corruption Act of 1992; the Public Protector Act; the
Public Service Act and regulations made thereunder and promulgated in
January this year; the South African Police Service Act; the Special
Investigating Units and Special Tribunals Act; the Executive Members'
Ethics Act; the National Prosecuting Authority Act; the Prevention of
Organised Crime Act; the Public Finance Management Act; the Promotion of
Access to Information Act; and the Protected Disclosures Act of 2000,
which, I would like to say to the President, is coming into effect this
coming Friday and which, once in force, will protect bona fide whistle-
blowers in both the public and the private sectors.

These laws are complemented and implemented by many official state-funded
anticorruption structures, such as the Public Service Commission, the
Auditor-General, the Public Protector, the SA Police Service, the Office of
the National Director of Public Prosecutions, the Assets Forfeiture Unit,
the Independent Complaints Directorate and, in certain circumstances, such
special investigating units as the President may establish under the law.
In addition to these laws, in 1995 we amended the Criminal Procedure Act of
1977 so that today, in terms of section 60(11) of the Act, a bail applicant
charged with corruption involving an amount in excess of R500 000 bears the
onus to establish that the interests of justice do not require his or her
detention.

Many other structures exist within various government departments and
institutions to deal with the problem of corruption. Moreover, partnerships
are being established with various segments of society to deal with this
problem. For instance, business has already joined the Public Service and
NGOs in implementing a code of conduct to promote a culture of integrity in
the business sector, and the banking sector has adopted a code of good
practice.

All this certainly goes a long way towards showing the seriousness with
which we approach this problem, notwithstanding the exclusion from the
investigation of the so-called arms acquisition scandal of the Special
Investigating Unit headed by Judge Willem Heath. I want to state
categorically that as Government we have nothing to hide in this regard. We
have given a public undertaking that we shall co-operate fully in any
investigation conducted by any person under the law. In keeping with our
undertaking, we are already making all relevant documentation available to
the investigation, which I understand is being co-ordinated by the Auditor-
General.

I also want to state that the exclusion of the so-called Heath Unit was not
politically motivated at all. On the contrary, it was based on sound legal
and practical considerations, some of which I will soon outline. We are a
law-governed, constitutional state and, as such, we are at all times guided
by the law and the basic principle of legality in doing whatever we have to
do in the execution of our arduous tasks as part of the national executive.
Our zeal in the fight against corruption can be no substitute for this
basic principle.

As a matter of law, the President may establish a special investigating
unit under the Special Investigating Units and Special Tribunals Act of
1996, solely for the purpose of investigating serious malpractices or
maladministration in connection with the administration of state
institutions, state assets and public money, as well as any conduct which
may seriously harm the interests of the public.

As the President of the Constitutional Court pointed out last year in
November, the President cannot establish such a unit solely ``to undertake
a fishing expedition to establish whether there may have been
malpractices''. Nor does the law sanction the launching of witch-hunts. The
Act requires a good level of specificity to justify the launching of an
investigation envisaged in section 2(2) thereof.

After all the commotion and vituperation emanating from our detractors, we
have yet to come across anyone who can tell us exactly what serious
malpractice, maladministration or conduct is to be investigated in
connection with the armaments acquisition programme. We have yet to be told
who bribed whom, what to do or to refrain from doing. Who received what
reward from whom, when, for doing or refraining from doing what?

The most we have been told by the most knowledgeable amongst us here,
including the hon the Leader of the Opposition, is that the press has
demonstrated who is related to whom amongst the people who had anything to
do with the armaments acquisition programme. In other words, in the minds
of our detractors, some people may already be guilty of the crime of being
related to others. Not even Rev Meshoe's jealous God, who punishes the
children for the sins of their fathers to the third and fourth generation,
will accept this crass nonsense.

What is even more flabbergasting is the answer the hon Dr Gavin Woods gave
in an interview with The Sunday Independent on Sunday. When asked how much
evidence he thought there was of corruption in this arms deal, the hon
member is on record as having said:


  Well, I cannot give you a final verdict. That is precisely why we wanted
  a professional investigation by a team including the Heath Unit. Of the
  material I have seen, I would say much of it is highly speculative, while
  some of it is more plausible. One theory is that immediately large public
  contracts are put to tender, there is the emergence of new black
  empowerment companies around each project. This theory goes on to suggest
  that the Government quietly manipulates the process to make sure that
  these companies are awarded business. This would have to be very
  secretive as it would have a very negative bearing on business sentiment
  in this country.

Essentially the hon member admits in the interview that there is no
evidence of corruption in this regard, but a lot of spurious information
the provenance of which is not entirely unknown in intelligence circles,
and much of which is highly speculative. In other words, there is no
probable cause warranting the launch of any investigation.

Nonetheless, because black economic empowerment entities suddenly spring up
and mushroom as large public contracts emerge - previously a preserve of
whites, may I say - and because one has in place this untrustworthy black-
led Government with a capacity or propensity to manipulate tender
processes, one has to unleash one's hounds and let them sniff around, in
the vain hope that they might find evidence of corruption. We surely need
to know, as this House, what sort of person in this day and age would
espouse such a palpably racist policy or theory in the nonracial one-nation
society that we are all presumably constructing on the ruins of our
colonial and apartheid past.

This House needs to know that my office literally begged Judge Heath to let
me have access to the information at his disposal, in order to assist the
President in making his decision. In a letter dated 19 January the learned
judge said the following:


  Following your telephone call this morning I have considered your request
  for information in the possession of the unit relating to the arms
  procurement package. As you will understand, the information that the
  unit has is extremely sensitive and any disclosure of this information
  could jeopardise the investigation, lead to victimisation of whistle-
  blowers and place potential witnesses at risk. As a result of the
  possible consequences, the unit is not in a position to disclose its
  information to your office.

In other words, in the logic of the author of this palpably insulting
missive, the President was supposed to put on a blindfold and issue a
proclamation allowing Judge Heath to embark upon yet another fishing
expedition, so soon after the Constitutional Court judgment in which the
court, quite rightly so, cautioned against that. The House further needs to
know that in any event, for some unfathomable reason, the unit had chosen
not to use this so-called extremely sensitive information when it requested
the President to issue a proclamation to enable it to investigate God knows
what.

According to the learned judges' letter of 22 January, they had relied on
the Auditor-General's report to Scopa, the Scopa hearings and the Scopa
report only. Much earlier in the process, the Public Protector, in a letter
dated 22 November last year, had already advised me that he was of the
opinion that it was not necessary for the President to issue a proclamation
to the Heath unit as, I quote:


  There is no evidence of any unlawful appropriation or expenditure of
  public money and, accordingly, no need for the SIU to recover any state
  assets or public money.


  The application by the SIU is based primarily on the special review by
  the Auditor-General and does not raise any new evidence.


  I believe that the Auditor-General, IDSEO and my office can adequately
  deal with the present issues.

Advocates Jannie Lubbe and Frank Kahn independently came to the same
conclusion afterwards.

Yesterday the hon Ken Andrew quoted selectively from certain correspondence
in his utter desperation to prove that the President of the country had
lied to the public on 19 January. The one letter which the hon member
thought the President ought to have quoted in full, too, states the
following:


  In the brief time available to us, we looked at the available information
  and we also consulted certain interested parties to obtain further
  information, including Ms De Lille.


  The Auditor-General has pointed out irregularities which merit further
  investigation, and it is too early to conclude whether criminal offences
  will be revealed.

Subsequently, the authors of that letter clarified this and stated that
there was no prima facie evidence on the basis of which any action could be
taken against any person under our criminal law in this regard. The two
senior advocates, who must surely have been embarrassed by the dastardly
political abuse of their advice, stated the following in a subsequent
letter to me dated 30 January:


  The opinions should be read together and, as far as we are concerned,
  there is no conflict between the views we expressed therein.

There is a dispute as to what the true wishes of this House might have been
when it adopted the Scopa report in November. But whatever the wishes of
this House might have been, this House cannot, by resolution, make the
executive act illegally. No person or institution, including Parliament, is
above the Constitution and the law. Gone are the days of white supremacy
and parliamentary sovereignty when Parliament could make any law affecting
the life, limb or property of anyone under its sway. Today the executive
operates solely under the Constitution and the law, and this House cannot
empower it by resolution to issue any proclamation under the law in order
to enable Judge Heath to embark upon any fishing expedition or conduct any
witch-hunt.

One of the reasons I gave in my advice to the President in this regard was
that the Heath unit had a lot of work to conclude and should thus not be
given another proclamation. In a letter dated 12 February, in other words,
this past Monday, the unit admits that out of 67 proclamations it was given
from the time it was established, it has, for all manner of reasons, only
concluded 10 ... [Interjections] ... and 57 are still outstanding. Thus, if
the President had given it the requested proclamation, he would have added
more work which it could not complete within the one-year period of grace
given us by the Constitutional Court to regularise the position of the head
of the unit.

Last but not least, I have been accused personally of seeking to subvert
the existing Special Investigating Unit by daring to suggest that once its
heavy workload had been finalised, the unit would disband. I wish to appeal
to my accusers to read the law in this regard before they make fools of
themselves. As can be gleaned from section 3(4) of the Act, it was never
the intention of Parliament to create permanent Public Service jobs by
stealth.

The Act provides explicitly that a member of a special investigating unit
shall hold office for the duration of the existence of such special
investigating unit. The members of the unit were all appointed by Judge
Heath in terms of section 3(2) of the Act as and when he thought it was
necessary for him to do so for the effective functioning thereof. They did
not thereby become permanent employees of the state.

To those among us, to those among our detractors who are genuinely
concerned about corruption and who would want to do something about it, I
can only advise them that sanctimony, hand-wringing, hand-on-heart and deep-
felt concern are not enough. They have to join us in the law-based
struggle, expose and fight corruption wherever it occurs, even in small
smoke-filled boardrooms.

I want to say to those hon members who are howling that I can only hold my
nose like this to them. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, President, Deputy President and honourable
House, local elections have come and gone, leaving behind them no major
changes in the political landscape.

The Government's massive machinery, with consummate adroitness, is able to
convert the voice of a clear ``no'' into an electoral ``yes''. The
electoral system must be reformed. We who suffer under it understand where
it pinches and where it crushes. The result of this obvious one-sidedness,
particularly among people who are illiterate or barely literate, or who are
unaccustomed to the intricacies and vagaries of a democratic system, is a
massive distortion of democracy. What this country needs is a democracy and
not a plutocracy - the rule by the rich, or by the adroit, or by those who
clearly represent themselves instead of the majority who are poor.
Unemployment is this nation's Achilles heel. The Gear policy, which has
been roundly condemned by us and all who care about the poor, is directly
responsible for this national calamity. Healthy and honest people want to
work for themselves and for their families. Promises do not convert into
food for hungry stomachs, clothes for naked people, land for the landless,
homes for the unhoused. It is now very urgent that unemployment benefits be
given to those who are not lazy, but suffer nonetheless and who are reduced
to a pitiable mass of humanity.

No one can enjoy a scrumptious meal or sleep in comfort in a luxurious
home, or drive a big new car in comfort, unless he or she can suppress and
silence the audible groans of the poor and the poorest of the poor. The
success of our economic power cannot be measured from the rooftops of our
exclusive suburbs, but only from the mats and cardboard boxes on which our
poor sleep in our streets and informal settlements, summer and winter, in
wet and dry weather.

Poverty is a time bomb which is ticking away and which might blow up in our
faces sooner rather than later. The call to eradicate this systemic and
racist pattern of poverty is made not on behalf of the poor but, in fact,
to protect the rich of this land. To repeat: the rich should heed the
clarion call, should wake up, and by making some little sacrifice like
paying a poverty eradication tax, an employment tax or a water tax, they
can ensure that all can be comfortable and enjoy the bare necessities of
this life in our so-called rich country.

Crime, we have long said, is like a cancer in our nation. A government that
wants to take firm measures to root out crime has our support. The
withholding of crime statistics from the nation, however, baffles us. The
moratorium on the statistics should be lifted soon - before June - because
we all know that crime has increased and that we are at the mercy of
criminals. This is a national challenge which demands that the whole nation
should stand together across the political divide.

Land is the primary national resource to satisfy the basic needs of the
people. As Tessa Marcus, author of Class and Gender Issues in Land and
Reform said, and I quote:


  Land is a fundamental component of property relations in every society
  since it is one of the natural resources essential for social existence.
  Its distribution is of vital concern to every citizen as it affects basic
  human rights.

Whoever owns land controls access to it, determines the use to which it is
put, decides the economic and political beneficiaries of production on it,
and decides how the world below it is to be exploited.

Pan-Africanism remains the only beacon of hope, stability and prosperity
for our continent of Africa. Problems remaining in countries like the DRC,
Somalia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea demonstrate that the forces of
anti-Pan-Africanism can no longer slander Pan-Africanism in the face of the
profound distress that Africa continues to suffer.

The invisibility of Pan-Africanism is shown by the fact that this past year
the PAC took part in the celebration of one hundred years of Pan-Africanism
at the centenary Pan-African Congress, attended by delegates from 126
countries in Africa and the diaspora.

Our country is beleaguered once more. The apartheid trap door which the
liberation forces closed, has been brought back by the arms deal. Why, one
asks, is it so difficult to use all the investigation tools at our disposal
- and here I mean all four commissions - to clean up this mess. To allege
corruption is not a crime, but to duck and dive is suspicious in the
extreme. There is absolutely no wisdom in avoiding the inevitable.

What is critical is not the personality or the colour of Judge Heath.
People need to be reminded that it was a black President of this country
who appointed him to this important task. For a long time, he was supported
and hailed by all and sundry. The issue here is greater than Judge Heath.
We have to fight corruption in a transparent and convincing way. Our courts
and history will deliver the final verdict.

The tragic HIV/Aids debate is another enigma which cannot be wished away.
Statistics state that about 4 million people are HIV-positive. On the
ground, particularly in black African areas, the shocking number of young
people who are dying and the funerals which thousands and thousands take
part in, demonstrate that this is not some hidden secret, but a gruesome
national experience and disaster.

The PAC welcomes the very belated introduction of the anti-HIV programme,
including Nevirapine for pregnant mothers, in 18 state hospitals. This is,
however, still inadequate. Only about 5% of pregnant mothers will be
covered by this scheme. Two hospitals have been chosen in each province to
provide counselling and HIV-testing and to supply Nevirapine as needed.

In spite of the grand economic system presented by the President, it is
possible that we may be short-sighted and actually counterproductive by
allowing the decimation of the flower of our youth, our main labour force
and human resource, by the killer disease Aids.

We must throw in every piece of gold, silver, platinum etc, and invest it
in Aids research. We must get our priorities right. To become an atomic
power, to fly to the moon or outer space, to travel in luxury cars, to live
in houses worth half a million and above with swimming pools all over, is
perhaps tolerable in a normal country and world, but most obscene and
revolting in a world facing a pandemic such as Aids.

An HON MEMBER: What about your car?
Dr M S MOGOBA: Give me more time and I will tell members. [Interjections.]
[Time expired.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Speaker, Mr President, Deputy
President and colleagues, it is a considerable achievement that we continue
to make progress in the fundamental restructuring of our economy. Those
with experience of this know that it is no easy task. Fundamental
restructuring requires consistency of policy and determination in the
implementation of that policy. We were clear on our strategies at the
outset and we have been prepared to accept good advice and ignore the bad.

The President laid great emphasis on the economy in his opening address on
Friday. The action plan he set out is the culmination of many years of work
and is made possible by the basic changes in fiscal and governmental
structures that have now been introduced.

As in all structures, there is little wisdom in building on a weak and
flawed foundation. Our first task was to design a new structure, the
Reconstruction and Development Programme, and then build a new foundation
for the economy. In the Gear programme we effectively put reinforcing steel
within that structure, and this reinforcing steel will remain to provide
continued strength to that structure.

The objective of the Gear was a macro-balance that was stable and robust in
the stormy seas of globalisation. But in doing this we had to ensure that
there was no negative fiscal impact on social expenditure. This is a very
considerable achievement if it is compared to the structural adjustment
programmes that have effectively been imposed on many countries.

However, we make no claim that we have overcome the massive challenges of
poverty, unemployment and uneven development, essentially the legacies of
our past. What we have done is to lay the foundation for a new high-growth
path for the economy which will increase its competitiveness and
efficiency, raise employment levels and reduce the poverty and persistent
inequality in our society. This is the thrust and the words of the
President's address to this House.

The action plan is an integrated set of interventions, precise
interventions, by the public sector that will be made in this fiscal year.
The essence of what is to be done can be stated simply. We are addressing
the basic cost and efficiency platform of the energy, transportation and
telecommunications systems. On this enhanced production platform we are
paying particular attention to the potential growth sectors and ensuring
that the cross-cutting support of infrastructure, human resource
development and technology keeps pace with the needs that are generated.

What we want to impact on is the growth rate, employment, small and medium
enterprises, black economic empowerment and the competitiveness of this
economy. We are confident that through Nedlac and the various working
groups with business, labour, black business and organised agriculture, we
will achieve unity in action towards these programmes.

As the Minister of Labour announced yesterday, we have also made progress
in agreeing on changes in the labour market dispensation. The integrated
rural development strategy and urban upgrading projects will be co-
ordinated programmes to ensure that there is fundamental socioeconomic
change in specific geographical areas as announced. So the basic principles
of the RDP remain and, in fact, are enhanced.

The actions planned had to be achievable, budgeted for and consistent with
the impact that we want to make. This action plan does not, obviously,
constitute everything that the Government will undertake during the coming
year. It does not mean that there are no other important sectors. If I
could give an example from my own department, the export sectors of the
capital goods, fabricated steel and flowers are growing rapidly and the
intense work that we do in these sectors will continue. But our objective
in the sectors identified is to carry out a series of actions that will
make a real difference to the level of growth and exports.

Globalisation presents many challenges as we try to define the role of the
state. In the pursuit of growth and development it is quite clear that the
role of the state is changing, but it does have to play a leading role. The
dogmatic, almost theocratic, calls for a smaller state do not address the
fundamental issues.

The actions we are taking reflect these complexities as we continue to
manage liberalisation in the provision of basic infrastructure. I noted
that the Leader of the Opposition welcomed managed liberalisation provided
we concentrated on liberalisation, as opposed to managing.

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER: Since we are mainly dealing with natural monopolies, this
comment shows very little understanding of the economics of these sectors.
If the process is not managed, then our objectives of more efficient cost-
competitive services for business and for all our consumers will not be
achieved.

I want to deal briefly with this managed liberalisation process in each of
the sectors, because it will have a major economic impact. In energy the
introduction of independent power producers will broaden the variety of
energy sources and, in particular, open the way for an extensive gas
network to be constructed. Whilst our electricity prices are extremely
competitive this more extensive and varied energy system both introduces an
element of competition and opens a range of new production technologies.
The gas grid brings into being an economic integration process with our
neighbours in Mozambique and Namibia.
In transportation, the opening of private sector involvement in port
operations will certainly attract investments and will have major
efficiency effects. The greater use of rail will lower the cost of
transport to the economy, since the externalities of road transport are in
fact high. The extension and improvement of roads in the various growth
areas open the possibilities, not only for more social upliftment, but also
for economic development.

In a global economy where knowledge and information are increasingly
critical, we have to ensure the efficiency and low-cost provision of basic
telecommunications services. This requires a marriage system of
competition. What we are dealing with in this sector is a limited capacity
which can expand at predictable rates, so we have to ensure that we neither
overload it by too many providers nor have too few, to allow them to seek
rent on the system.

We do have a dynamic and competitive IT sector in South Africa, and we are
now working with this sector to strengthen the capability. I am
particularly pleased, and the President mentioned this, that all major
companies operating in South Africa have committed themselves in writing to
work with Government to fast-track the skills development in this vital
sector.

Our ability to take the steps that the President and I have outlined does
not come from some last-minute clever thinking at a Cabinet lekgotla. It
comes from the fact that basic groundwork has been done and it comes from
the determination of Government led by the President to ensure co-
ordination in governance. We have in addition created the structures in
Government to ensure that we monitor and oversee the progress of the action
plan.

I wish to address a challenge that the President has put before us. He
called on us to unite in action to make one nation out of the two that
exist, and to build an economy that provides a better life for all our
people. Without the latter the former will be difficult, but without the
former the challenge of achieving the latter is going to be immeasurably
more difficult.

What, therefore, does the concept of uniting in action mean for the
political parties in this House? Does it mean uniformity or that we have to
disregard our political differences? Will it in some way prevent the
opposition in this Parliament from being an effective opposition? I do not
believe that either of these will have to apply. What is required is a
fundamental commitment to the success of our democracy and confidence in
the capacity of our economy.

The argument put forward by the hon the Leader of the Opposition and Mr Van
Schalkwyk was in essence that the ANC was responding to criticism merely by
vilifying its critics and accusing them of being unpatriotic. To us on the
ANC side our frustration arises from the perception that the opposition is
not fully committed to the two factors I have just mentioned.

Our basis for this arises from a particular type of conduct, and I am going
to use, once again, the arms issue to illustrate what I am talking about,
not to address in detail a host of accusations, but to illustrate how we
could perhaps correct our conduct to bring about unity in action. Both Mr
Ken Andrew and Mr Bantu Holomisa, two amongst many speakers, have, I must
say, made outrageous comments and accusations on the arms deal. These were
merely a concatenation of inaccuracies that they would not dare make under
the glare of the libel law. [Interjections.] They paint a picture on their
canvas of some kind of real banana republic and then they say that the ANC
is scaring away investment. I want to argue that this conduct is entirely
unjustified, since the very constitutional and legal processes that
constitute our new democracy are there to test accusations made.
[Interjections.] If I do not use the processes that strengthen confidence
in our democratic order, but merely call their capacity into question, then
I must not be surprised when my understanding of patriotism is questioned.
[Interjections.]

Investigations are in progress by the constitutional and legal structures
of this country. Minister Maduna has outlined this in some detail, and let
me repeat: Investigations are in progress by the constitutional and legal
structures of the country. The Government and the Ministers most concerned
are offering their fullest possible co-operation. [Interjections.] No
investigation has been completed, and both the Auditor-General's special
review and the report of the Special Committee on Public Accounts, Scopa,
are initial reports.

The executive made a very simple point. [Interjections.] We made the
decisions, but we were never asked how or why we did that. Accordingly, in
our view, we have argued that not all relevant information was at the
disposal of either the Auditor-General or Scopa. In the case of Scopa, the
report states quite clearly that such deals are prone to corruption.

No adjudicating body can make an assumption of general guilt when judging a
specific case. [Interjections.] Our point is simple, and that is that such
a predisposition will encourage a fishing expedition, and such
inquisitorial processes are fundamentally at odds with good law and
democracy. [Interjections.]

When the executive objects to this approach, and other matters it considers
to be errors, we are not blocking the processes, we are exercising
absolutely essential rights to be heard on the constitutional requirements
of our state. [Interjections.] Let me deal with the Auditor-General as
well. The executive made perfectly simple propositions. We said that in
regard to not following the tender procedures, we believe they have not
taken information into account. With regard to the deal on the Hawk, they
do not know what the decision-makers decided. In regard to the national
participation programme, they are making a judgment which we disagree with.
[Interjections.]

This is not blocking any investigation, and we have indicated quite clearly
the conflict of interest we had dealt with in the statement, if hon members
read it. [Interjections.] We took specific steps to deal with conflict of
interest. So, there is no blocking whatsoever. One cannot require that we
respect the Constitution, and then because we think, as has happened -
mistakenly, as my colleague Minister Maduna has set out - that a particular
judge will do most damage to Government, insist that he be involved despite
a Constitutional Court ruling.

The damage being done to the task of building a nation and an economy is
the view that there are significant elements of our society who have no
confidence in new structures of the state, not the Government, the state.
Hysteria and assertions that in effect call into question the
constitutional efficacy of our state do no one any good. We know, I hope,
that we have judicial and constitutional processes that have the capacity
and the integrity to ascertain whether there was indeed wrongdoing. It may
suit our political agenda to promote an aura of corruption, but does it
build our democracy or confidence in the economy? [Interjections.] The
investigation is being done, and it will have an outcome. [Interjections.]

I wish to contrast this approach with something that was very different.
Recently South Africa sent a large delegation of business people,
scientists, Ministers and government officials with the President to Davos.
We began to see what one nation can look like. The delegation was mixed as
regards race, language and capacity, but it was confident, fully aware of
the global developments and confident in the future of South Africa.

The individuals had different political allegiances, but the delegation was
confidently South African. It did not hesitate to raise criticism in an
informed manner, but it made it clear that this was a society that did and
could resolve its differences. Let us build this approach everywhere,
including in this Parliament. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, although this year's presidential speech
was a welcome improvement over that of last year, I hope the President will
forgive me if I say that the advice he has been getting from some of his
closest advisers is wrong, and out of touch with what is happening in South
Africa. [Interjections.]

Since coming to power, many ANC representatives have lost touch with their
communities, if they ever were in touch with them at all. [Interjections.]
Too many ANC MPs are not seen in their constituencies, too many MPs live
permanently in Cape Town and pretend to represent constituencies in
Gauteng, the Northern Province and the Free State. [Interjections.] The
people see us, and they do not see them. [Interjections.]

The problem is compounded by many who were in exile for long years. I am
not stating that people in exile had a wonderful time, or that they did not
make many sacrifices. I am aware of the personal stories of some, and no
one can take away from them the contributions which they made towards
liberating our country. The difficulty is that they were not part of daily
life in South Africa, and for decades some had little or no contact with
ordinary people. [Interjections.] The circles in which exiles moved in
foreign countries had a hothouse atmosphere in which the gossip was similar
to cocktail- party talk about who was in and who was out, who had the
favour of the President and who the next leader would be. These concerns
were far removed from those of ordinary people in South Africa who had to
live in poverty and deprivation.

This has led to a situation in which we find some politicians who love
humanity in general and the cause in particular, but have very little
regard for individual men and women. Intellectual remoteness like this has
led to some members of the Government having priorities far removed from
those of our people. There is a big difference between walking the streets
of Johannesburg, Soweto and Alexandra, and sitting in the delegates' lounge
at the United Nations. The elite who move in rarefied circles, palaces and
council chambers of the world, minimise in their own minds the matters
which are of concern to real and ordinary people. They tend to
overemphasise ideological and political matters that rank far down the list
of things which are important to our people.

This remoteness between the governors and governed is starting to impact on
the ANC Government. Instead of showing concern and doing something
constructive, positive and visible about jobs, crime, Aids and corruption,
the Government has begun stumbling from crisis to crisis.

The President will not enjoy me saying it, but I think it is incumbent on
me to tell him the truth. His advisers do not tell him what he needs to
hear, and that is the biggest failing of this Government. He is surrounded
by a small coterie of elite advisers who do not give him the broad range of
advice which a leader needs before deciding on his course.

Some of those who advise him are far from expert, and they need to be
replaced with others who will give him advice that will keep him out of
trouble and prevent the sort of gross embarrassment that he suffered
recently when he addressed the nation on television. A legal adviser who
allows her President to go on camera with an organogram drawn up by the
editor of Noseweek and compounds it by permitting the President to misquote
senior legal people, thereby placing a cloud over the President's own
probity, deserves to be fired. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The next election, just like the past four, will be fought on the question
of delivery to our people. Some of his advisers want to fight on the
question of race and demonise the opposition. I want to tell him that that
is not what interests our people. Unless progress is made in tackling
unemployment, crime, Aids and corruption, the mild setback which the ANC
received in 2000 will snowball and the DA, as the alternative, will
strengthen. [Interjections.]

His Government is being sidetracked by race issues instead of focusing on
delivery. Some of the President's people are letting him down. People like
Minister Tshwete attack and vilify a whole community on a racist basis.
Minister Maduna who is seating there and looking so pleased with himself
stated: ``I do not socialise with whites.'' [Interjections.] Does it not
occur to that hon Minister that such language is offensive, not least to
white people in his own party and organisation. [Interjections.] That same
Minister said that he could not understand the reaction of the Portuguese.
He said that our Government refers to Chinese triads, Nigerian drug lords
and the Italian Mafia without any complaint from the governments involved.
He does not even understand that equating the Portuguese community in South
Africa with gangster organisations is a gross racist insult. He does not
even understand that. [Interjections.]
Last night we heard the hon Vincent Smith presenting the Scopa controversy
as a racial matter. I would like to tell the hon member that that is not a
racial matter, that it is not a black and white matter, but that it is a
matter of right and wrong, a matter of good governance, openness and
accountability. [Interjections.] That hon member is finished anyway because
the hon Tony Yengeni knows he cannot rely on him any longer. He has had to
be pulled back out of the clutches of his other colleagues. Anyway, before
that hon member goes on retirement, I want to quote what Cyril Madlala of
the Sunday Independent had to say: He said:


  But this Government does seem to relish wallowing from one crisis to
  another. Because it has all the answers, it would defy counsel by those
  outside the inner circle and blame the media, counter-revolutionaries,
  conspirators and opposition parties for all their troubles.

What really saddens me about the President is that almost all of the white
people that I have talked to think that he hates white people, or at least
dislike them. [Interjections.] I am telling the truth. That is what white
voters think of the Presidency. Coloured and Asian voters think that he is
indifferent to them and black voters think he does not care about them.

That perception is the one that should be destroyed, as the President has
to be seen as the President of all the people, the President of the whole
of South Africa; and then he will have the backing of people like me and
many others in this Assembly and outside of it. [Interjections.]

It rests with the ANC to decide whether they are going to move away from
the sickness of this concentration on race all the time and whether they
will get back to doing something about the real concerns of our people -
jobs, crime, corruption and HIV/Aids. The choice is theirs. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, before calling on the next speaker, I wish
to rule on the matter that was raised yesterday. During that debate, the
hon Mr De Lange raised a point of order in which he objected to the hon Ken
Andrew having accused the President of basing or saying things on the basis
of false evidence.

Hon members, the President, while not a member of the National Assembly, is
subject to the Rules while he is in the House, and he is also entitled to
the same respect and protection as hon members. Yesterday I responded to Mr
De Lange by saying that I had heard the word ``false'' attached to
``information'' and not ``evidence''. This was indeed correct, since the
unrevised Hansard of Mr Andrew's speech reads as follows:


  By using selective quotes and false information, the President made a
  fool of himself and embarrassed South Africa in the process.

It is not unparliamentary to allege that incorrect information has been
conveyed, provided there is no suggestion that it is deliberately done. In
this instance, however, the meaning of the word ``false'' is significant.
The Oxford Dictionary gives it two meanings. It may mean wrong or
incorrect. But it also means lying, deceitful or spurious. The context of
the rest of the speech, in particular the reference in the same sentence to
``selective quotes'' indicates that it is the second meaning of the word
that was intended. That meaning could signify dishonest intent on the part
of the President.
In the circumstances, I call upon Mr Andrew to withdraw the allegation that
he used ``false'' information. It is specifically to the use of the word
``false'' when it is coupled in that sentence as false information. Mr
Andrew, I would ask you to withdraw that, please.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, it was not my intention that the second
interpretation from the dictionary was ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Mr K M ANDREW: What was intended may be incorrect or erroneous information,
and I have no hesitation in withdrawing in terms of the interpretation that
you have placed on the words.

Adv J H DE LANGE: Madam Speaker, arising out of the point of order and the
ruling you have made, I would like to place on record that the ANC will be
investigating this matter further. We feel ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Adv J H DE LANGE: We want to place it on record that, firstly, we will
investigate whether there should be a committee to investigate the
statement he has made. Secondly, we want to investigate the possibility
that there has been a transgression of the resolution passed by this House
that when the dignity of a member is attacked that should be done by way of
resolutions and, thirdly, whether the matter should be struck from the
record.

We will accordingly investigate this matter and obviously approach the
correct authorities before steps are taken.

The SPEAKER: Order! Mr De Lange, you indicated that intention yesterday.
When it is raised I will respond on the substance. [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, on a separate point of order: During the
debate by the hon Mr Gibson, the hon Mr Momberg said to him that he was a
liar, which I believe is unparliamentary and I ask that you ask him to
withdraw.

The SPEAKER: It is unparliamentary, Mr Momberg.

Mr M J MOMBERG: Madam Speaker, I withdraw. [Laughter.]
Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, arising from my point of order: I want to say
that the DP will be looking into whether Mr Momberg has frequently been
using that kind of behaviour and whether we should have a committee of
Parliament to look into that ... [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Order! When the DP raises that point, I will also respond to
it. We will now proceed with the debate.

Ms T MODISE: Madam Speaker, the President of South Africa Mr Thabo Mbeki,
Deputy President, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, I do not understand
why the hon Gibson was going around trying to get TV time. It was really to
make a fool of himself by trying to tell us how we should relate with the
people he has just discovered. [Laughter.]

We all need jobs for our people, Gibson. We all agree that we need peace
and confess our desperate love for democracy. We are simply confounded by
the meaning of these concepts. We need to agree that democracy comes with a
responsibility and a price. South Africa needs to continue moving away from
the narrow reductionist dichotomy between war and peace, guns or houses,
and move towards a global conceptualisation of collective security,
regional and international peace, and peacekeeping.

We have no choice. South Africa has a constitutional obligation to maintain
a credible Defence Force. Archbishop Ndungane tells South Africa that
instead of refurbishing the SANDF, we must pour all our resources into the
fight against Aids. Although this sounds good, it is unreasonable. It is
only the naivé and the amazingly innocent who will continue to delude
themselves and the people of this country that reducing defence expenditure
necessarily translates into more money for Aids, jobs, poverty alleviation
and houses.

If there is no such innocence, then we conclude that there is mischief on
the part of the archbishop. There are issues that he must work on. The
rains have stayed away and the farmers are worried. The good archbishop
must go up the mountain and pray. [Laughter.] Domestic violence is rife
amongst and against his congregants. He must do social ministry. The bombs
have been falling on his doorstep. We need his fervent prayers and ministry
to the warlords of Cape Town. He could join other men and women of the
cloth in the moral regeneration that is taking place here and stay out of
what is obviously out of his scope of things. Of course, the PAC could make
him president and bring him to Parliament, and then he can play politics to
his heart's content. [Laughter.]

It is not a question of having the one thing called peace or a programme on
Aids to the exclusion of the other thing called defence or houses, but
rather the balancing of the needs and priorities of the nations. We have
recently lived through the anger and civil unrest of the people of Lesotho,
Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia. We know of the desperation of the people of
Sudan, Somalia, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and others. Throughout
all these conflicts of class and ideology, race, ethnic cleansing and
democratisation, South Africa has played the role of a mediator.

Sometimes a patient sister country lends a hand or advises, as was the case
in Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Sometimes the neighbour
bears the brunt of illegal immigration, joblessness, crime and poverty that
knows no boundaries, always ready to talk, to rescue bombed Americans and
new-born Mozambicans out of trees, reconciliatory and giving compensation
for the sins not all of us committed.

We do this mediation because we recognise that a better life for all will
remain an ideal on paper unless we help secure law and order, political
stability and peace amongst our neighbours. For as long as the Zimbabwean
dollar is worth nothing, for as long as Angola knows no stability and
peace, for as long as Swazi workers are unable to freely bargain on the
shop floor, South Africa will know no stability, no peace, no development
and no true democracy. For as long as the democratic initiative in Nigeria
remains uncertain and ethnic cleansing remains a threat in Burundi and
Rwanda, a better life for all remains an almost unattainable dream because
unrest next door means possible cross-border arms smuggling and crime that
would mean a departure from our national focus and interest.

The United Nations, in the words of its charter was founded to save
succeeding generations from the scourge of war. The role of South Africa as
a member of the UN becomes important in fulfilling the peacekeeping role in
this region. Once called upon, our forces are deployed and they must be
able to defend themselves, mission components and mission mandates. This
means that they need to be equipped accordingly to carry out the mandate
professionally.

Mr Kofi Annan observes that until member states renew their commitments to
this institution by increasing financial support, the United Nations will
fail to meet its challenges. We need to relook the practice that Africa can
only be represented by one country on the UN Security Council. Therefore we
must encourage the Nigeria and South Africa initiative in this regard.

On a very recent trip to Nigeria members of the Portfolio Committee on
Defence could not stop the flow of questions from politicians and soldiers
alike on the question of why South Africa was not taking the lead in
peacekeeping. South Africa can no longer run away from this responsibility.
How can we continue to dream of a better life for all when our neighbours
outside our borders ask for help and we resist the courage to comply?  How
can we be part of the African solution to African problems if the only
reason we have for not participating in peacekeeping is a sense of
wrangling on whether or not to buy weapons and equipment to which we have
already agreed to in the Defence Review, which was endorsed by this
Parliament?
We must ensure that the South African National Defence Force is well
equipped and well trained for this task. What gives the factors of
geography, natural resources and industrial capacity their actual
importance for the power of a nation, is the state of military
preparedness. South Africa needs to spend to reach these levels. South
African borders need to be properly secured until there is no longer a
need. South African marine resources, land, skies and people must be well
protected. Good wishes just do not quite do this job. We need that modern
navy, air force and army to patrol our seas and defend the integrity,
people and interests of South Africa.

The Constitution of South Africa in Chapter 11, section 198 (a) prescribes
that national security must reflect the resolve of South Africans, as
individuals and as a nation, to live as equals, to live in peace and
harmony, to be free from fear and want and to seek a better life. The White
Paper entitled Defence in a democracy process states amongst others that
South Africa shall pursue peaceful relations with other states. The SANDF
shall have a primarily defensive orientation and posture. Force levels,
equipment and armament, as well as military expenditure, shall be
determined by the defence policy. That defence policy and military activity
shall be sufficiently transparent to enable meaningful parliamentary and
public scrutiny and debate. The SA National Defence Force shall be a
balanced, modern, technologically advanced military force which is capable
of executing its tasks efficiently and effectively.

It would seem to me that defence is only good when it does not cost us
money. It is good when it can perform to make us proud without regard to
the safety and the morale of the members of the Defence Force, as well as
the welfare of their families. When we want to scream about the
constitutional rights to housing, we must also remember the provisions of
section 198(a).

When Parliament questioned the acquisition of the Spanish ship a broad
consultative programme began. The Defence Review, which removed the matters
of defence from the realm of secrecy and placed them in public and popular
debate, was a national consultative process that included national and
provincial stakeholders. A broad cross-section of the South African
population attended these workshops and conferences.

This Parliament adopted that Defence Review with all its provisions on
force, design, armaments and weaponry, therefore the budgetary implications
should be known to this Parliament.  We need to take a decision soon on the
maritime helicopters. We cannot afford a delay. We cannot afford not to
refurbish, otherwise we will not be making sure that we provide, as the
Constitution obliges us to do. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, Mr President, Deputy President, Ministers
and hon members, South Africa is not a normal democratic country. We are
still undergoing a major political transformation. However, beyond
political transformation our pledged responsibility is to develop
consistent economic activity, capacity building and to make a crucial
assessment as to whether the lives of the masses have been improved.

The President must be complimented on the opening address he has made in
Parliament last week. Throughout the country the media was kind and
citizens comforted themselves in the great message of hope. The MF has been
jubilant and feels that very strong emphasis was on unity, reconciliation
and the development of the long-suffering masses. My leader, Mr A Rajbansi,
has requested me to convey the party's good wishes to the President.
[Applause.] Certain cynics, as usual, rejoice in what they have described
as omissions in the President's speech. However, we also rejoice in the
excellent response given by the Deputy President on the same day.

We have just emerged from a hectic local government election where the DA
in Durban did its best to destroy the MF, using the filthiest tactics ever
used in an election campaign. I am pleased to announce that the MF's 10
seats have sunk the DA for the next five years. After all, the MF holds a
balance of the power. Reconciling the minority with the majority is not a
political crime. Instead, it is an investment in developing South Africa.

The President announced relief measures for the prioritised areas,
especially KwaZulu-Natal. I am advocating a strong case for KwaZulu-Natal,
which has the largest population and has suffered immense poverty during
the apartheid era. We also require assistance in respect of the points
development, the upgrading of the harbour and the development of the Tugela
basin, not forgetting the King Shaka Airport, a historical accolade in
South Africa.
Matters relating to our traditional leaders are being addressed and the MF
has confidence that our President and the president of the IFP, Dr
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, will together resolve this outstanding issue.

The MF is concerned about the booming rate of unemployment which puts our
people, especially those who are unskilled and semi-skilled, under pressure
to compete for the unevenly distributed economic opportunities basically to
survive.

Informal street trade has become the only practical alternative for
millions of unemployed people. Unfortunately, the frequent change in street
trade bye-laws at local government level has resulted in the
criminalisation of ordinary street vendors through conviction and the
confiscation of goods. This actually negates job creation opportunities and
has a booming effect on the increase in crime.

As long as poverty exists, street trading throughout the country will be
inevitable. Therefore, the MF advocates that the current effective
application of street trade bye-laws should be replaced by separate,
unified national legislation. After all, this should be one of the ideal
choices to practically promote microbusiness to accommodate the poorest of
the poor.

Implementing a set of national guidelines will automatically result in the
establishment of a negotiation framework for the street traders and local
authorities in order to formalise a relationship and to understand the true
economic purpose of street trading.

In order to govern our people to meet their full human potential, it is the
state's duty to scrutinise constantly the social and economic crisis at
grass-roots level. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, hon President, as it now seems to be the
President's policy to promote leaders of small opposition parties to the
post of Deputy Minister, I suppose it would be wise for me to choose my
words carefully today! [Laughter.]

On the whole, I felt better, on leaving the House on Friday, than I did a
year ago. The emphasis on microeconomics and specific plans in that regard
was necessary. As one of my professors at the theological seminary always
said:``Jy kan nie op die aarde bly en in die hemel loseer nie!'' [You
cannot live on earth and lodge in heaven!]

In what the President announced, I sensed something more of a realistic,
pragmatic and managerial approach than a mere socialist one. The
conciliatory trend, especially at the end, also did not go unnoticed. It
was a huge improvement on the two-nation theory of the past.

It is a pity, therefore, that the contributions of some of the President's
party members in this debate reflected the opposite. When will they stop
desperately playing the race card in order to demonise the sound democratic
practice of positive criticism? One day they will find out that the race
card is no longer a trump card, but rather the two of clubs.

The next step must be the recognition of this one nation as a pluralistic
one, a nation of nations. The golden recipe for nation-building is not to
weld together 40 or 50 million individuals into some kind of amorphous
unity, but rather to place a healthy emphasis on and recognise the
principle and fact of diversity. A mere change from minority domination to
majority domination still reflects an outdated and impractical
dispensation.

Die regte van minderhede, naamlik die artikel 185-kommissie vir die regte
van taal-, kultuur- en godsdiensgemeenskappe wat reeds sewe jaar lank
uitstaande is, moet vanjaar van die grond af kom. Ek sou graag die
President se standpunt in dié verband wou verneem.

Die beloofde lessenaar vir Afrikaans in die agb President se kantoor is nog
so leeg soos 'n Parlementslid se beursie. Wanneer gaan dit konkrete
gestalte kry? Die plek van tradisionele leiers hang nog in die lug nadat
hulle die fopspeen gevat het wat tydens die verkiesing aan hulle aangebied
is.

Die belangrikste is egter wat nié gesê is nie. Die President het vyf
terreine van misdaad uitgewys waarop die Regering hom spesifiek gaan
toespits. Geen enkele woord is gesê nie oor een van die kritiekste en
plofbaarste misdaadsituasies in die land, naamlik plaasaanvalle.

'n Petisie met bykans 400 000 handtekeninge is deur Aksie Stop
Plaasaanvalle namens die totale spektrum van georganiseerde landbou aan die
President oorhandig - die grootste petisie in die geskiedenis van ons land.
Daar was 400 handtekeninge vir elke een wat mnr Karl Niehaus op sy lys kon
bymekaar skraap. Altesame 253 boere per 100 000 word per jaar vermoor, 20
keer meer as die gemiddeld.

Hierdie situasie het 'n kruitvat geword. Ek het met dank kennis geneem van
die stappe wat minister Tshwete gister in dié verband aangekondig het. Ek
wil pleit vir nog nouer skakeling met die boere en alle boerderystrukture,
nie net die geselekteerdes nie. Praat met die mak boere én die kwaai boere,
want almal het 'n grondwetlike reg op die beskerming van hul lewe en
eiendom. In die werksaamhede van Aksie Stop Plaasaanvalle het die TLU, LWO
en Agri SA saamgestaan om hierdie saak aan te pak. Ek pleit by die agb
President: as hy ernstig is oor hierdie saak, moet hy hul volle
afvaardiging persoonlik te woord staan. Hy weet nie wat dit sal beteken
nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[As regards the rights of minorities, the section 185 commission for the
promotion and protection of the rights of cultural, religious and
linguistic communities, which has been outstanding for seven years now,
must be established this year. I would like to know the standpoint of the
President in this regard.

The promised desk for Afrikaans in the hon the President's office is still
as empty as the purse of a member of Parliament. When will this become a
reality? The position of traditional leaders is still hanging in the
balance after they accepted the pacifier they were offered during the
elections.

Most important, however, is what was not said. The President pointed out
five areas of crime that the Government would specifically focus on. Not
one word was said about one of the most critical and explosive crime
situations in the country, namely farm attacks.

A petition containing nearly 400 000 signatures was handed to the President
by Action: Stop Farm Attacks on behalf of the total spectrum of organised
agriculture - the largest petition in the history of the country. There
were 400 signatures for every one that Karl Niehaus scraped together for
his list. Altogether 253 farmers per 100 000 are murdered every year, 20
times more than the average.

This situation has become a powder keg. I took note with gratitude of the
steps Minister Tshwete announced in this regard yesterday. I want to plead
for even closer liaison with the farmers and all farming structures, not
only the selected few. Talk to both the tame farmers and the angry farmers,
because everyone has a constitutional right to the protection of their life
and property. In the activities of Action: Stop Farm Attacks the TAU, AEO
and Agri SA co-operated to address this issue. I am pleading with the hon
the President: if he is serious about this issue, he should meet their
entire delegation. He does not know what that would mean.]

He has a crucial responsibility to create an environment that will be
conducive to stopping farm attacks. This includes condemning farm attacks
unconditionally. I repeat: unconditionally. He must condemn hate speech
against farmers unconditionally, especially the way in which isolated
incidents of deplorable acts by white farmers are represented as the rule
and not the exception. He must condemn and change the unfortunate adapt-or-
die approach to that of a co-operative and inclusive approach with all, and
not a few selected stakeholders only. He must condemn and stop the
unjustified criminalisation and prosecution of law-abiding farmers who
merely try to protect their life and property. I would like to tell the
President that his personal role in this crucial matter cannot be
overemphasised. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Madam Speaker, Comrade
President and hon members,


  ... gradually, step by step, our country proceeds further away from its
  painful past. We, its citizens, who are very close to the coalface of
  change, may not easily see the steady transformation that informs all
  aspects of our national life.

Thus began President Mbeki's address to this House last Friday.

In paying tribute to all our people, the members of the opposition should
really pay attention to all our people. This is what the ANC has constantly
and always said and what our President says. In paying tribute to all our
people, black and white, who have contributed to this progress, the
President has called to all across the colour line to dedicate this year to
building unity in action for change.

I would like to address some aspects of this change and of the remarkable
level of delivery that goes with it. Yes, sometimes we at the coalface do
not easily see the progress although, too often, some are transfixed by the
problems and the obstacles and perhaps do not see further than their noses.
I am very impressed that, after all these years, the hon Douglas Gibson has
at last discovered the African townships and the coalface. I would like to
say: ``Well done'' to the hon Douglas Gibson. It is about time too!
[Interjections.]

The changes in our country in under seven years are impressive. The
President has referred to the figures in housing, electricity, clean water
delivery, land redistribution, the economic indices and so on. He has also
referred to the daunting backlog of poverty. He has referred to the cholera
outbreak and the need for a more vigorous extension of the sanitation
system.

One is reminded of the long road of development in Europe and of the
struggle of those countries to eliminate cholera and other diseases. In
1850, the cholera epidemic in London wiped out thousands, and it led to the
realisation by the Victorian authorities of the need for water and
sanitation services to eradicate this disease. It took them decades and
decades, as it did the other European countries, before they had
established the basic services for their people and the necessary local
government structures to ensure the sustainable maintenance and management
of the system. Even 50 years later, on the eve of what was called the Anglo-
Boer War, the British military authorities expressed their grave alarm at
the stunted, ill-nourished recruits they were depending on. It took another
50 years, to post-war Europe, for the modern basic services to emerge in
most parts of that continent.

We are not going to take that long. The President's speech shows that his
Government is committed to speeding up delivery. What I am alluding to is
that by comparison with, say Britain in the mid-nineteenth century - and
that was the richest, most powerful imperial power of the day - our rate of
progress is, quite frankly, phenomenal. I am referring to the roads, the
clinics, the schools, the hospitals, the education, the classrooms and all
the very impressive developments.

Our community water service programme began post-1994, and we have
delivered, in that time, to 7 million people in this country, who were
without clean safe water in 1994. We know that there are another 7 million
people that we must reach. When one looks at the extent of poverty and
under-development in the rural areas and, indeed, our urban townships and
informal settlements, the vast differences in wealth in this country
clearly demonstrate that we are a country of rich and poor.

The President's speech illustrated Government's offensive against rural and
urban poverty, through its integrated rural development strategy and our
urban renewal programme. In practice, this means, as the President once
stated, that when a clinic or a school is built roads, water and
electricity will simultaneously be provided.

The socioeconomic benefits of providing affordable basic services are well
recognised. The provision of water supply and sanitation in particular
makes a clear contribution to the health and wellbeing of all our people,
particularly the poor. It has a direct impact on women who remain mainly
responsible for carrying water and using it to try to maintain a clean and
healthy home.

We have seen that the introduction of charges for pure water at even a low
rate has resulted in communities resorting to unsafe sources. For these
reasons, the Government has decided to ensure that poor households are
given a basic supply of water free of charge. This is not an empty or
hollow election promise.

Based on the policy framework for delivery, last month the Cabinet approved
a programme of implementation of 6 000 litres of safe water per household
per month. The date set for implementing the free minimum basic water
policy by local government structures is 1 July 2001. Free basic water is
to be funded using a combination of the equitable share of revenue of local
government and internal cross-subsidies from appropriately structured water
tariffs in a manner which best reflects the specific situation in a local
government area.

The implementation programme has three components: the preparation of
detailed guidelines for local government, the establishment of dedicated
support teams for local government and the establishment of mechanisms to
finance and implement the required metering and billing of water supplies.
This is not an empty election promise but a pledge that this Government is
living up to.

The President indicated in his speech that this year will see an
unprecedented acceleration of the delivery of water and sanitation. In a
clear vote of confidence in our Government, the European Union has
contributed a R500 million grant over the next three years for the water
and sanitation services.

Part of the problem in delivering sanitation has been the current demand-
led approach which was dependent on individual households requesting a R600
grant to build pit latrines. Although based on an international best-
practice approach, we have found that the going is far too slow, and that
since the cholera outbreak, it is clear that we must accelerate the
building of these latrines. It is for this reason that an urgent review of
the Government's sanitation policy is underway and we are committed to
focusing far more resources to accelerate the delivery of sanitation.

Against this background, it is essential to understand that the Government
has mobilised our full resources to contain the cholera epidemic in KwaZulu-
Natal. I wish to congratulate the Minister of Health and the Department on
the handling of the epidemic. It is largely due to their efforts that the
fatality rate in South Africa, as pointed out by the World Health
Organisation, is well below the international fatality rate in cholera
epidemics. With the assistance of the Ministry for Agriculture and Land
Affairs, and the hon member Gen Constand Viljoen here, we have approached
the cholera problem through our unity in action. And with the general's
assistance and that of the Ministries, we have held discussions with Agri
SA to ask them for assistance. They are ready to help the Government combat
this epidemic with the distribution of bleach and educational health
material, the setting up of water tanks and the provision of emergency
water.

Also in the spirit of unity, I would like to pay tribute to a farmer from
Mkhuze, in KwaZulu-Natal, Mr Charl Senekal, who has spent R20 million to
provide not only irrigation for his sugar estate, but also life-giving
water to almost 200 000 people living in Mkhuze and Bethesda hospital at
Umbombo. [Applause.] I believe that Mr and Mrs Senekal are in the gallery.

The ANC appreciates the farming community of this country, and members will
hear that not simply from this speaker, but from the countless members of
the ANC, including our President, Ministers and members of this House.
During the local elections campaign I was, frankly, extremely impressed to
find so many mense van die platteland; die boere was ook daar [people from
the rural areas; the farmers were also there]. They came to the fore and
had discussions, not only with me, but everybody from the ANC whom I was
travelling with.

We thank the heroic doctors and health workers for their selfless work
around the clock on the cholera victims. We are encouraged by the many
people in KwaZulu-Natal who are working with my department in erecting
those pit latrines. I am talking about the ordinary rural people living in
those homesteads who have responded magnificently by fetching the river
sand and performing the labour, together with the contractors. In
approximately nine weeks, as a result of the R35 million which my
department made available in the two key cholera-stricken areas of KwaZulu-
Natal, 9 000 pit latrines will have been or are being erected. These will
serve 100 000 people, as well as 200 schools where latrine blocks are being
built. Those schools will serve another 100 000 learners. This is how this
Government intends to deal with the sanitation backlog in the same way that
we have energetically been dealing with bringing clean and safe water to 7
million rural people so far. [Applause.]

As our President has pointed out, the success of the Government's plan of
action will also depend on the extent to which people can be mobilised so
that they become active participants in the upliftment of themselves and
their own communities. Let us reiterate our President's call for all South
Africans to dedicate this year to building unity in action for change. That
is the way to bridge the rural divide between the rich and the poor and
forge the unity of all our people. [Applause.]

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, hon President, I would like to react
briefly to the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry and thank him for
what he said about the farmers. They are in desperate need of attention
from the Government and I am glad that he recognised their contribution.
I fully agree with the suggestion in the President's state of the nation
speech that within the ordinary, loyal South African lives the will and
desire for our country to be successful. Although we share a diverse and
complicated legacy which we do not fully understand at all times, we are
also compelled to share a common future, if we want the success we so
desperately desire.

The important question is how to unleash the potential and talents within
our people to work together as one nation. There is no simple answer to
this daunting question, but I firmly believe that the key to the delivery
of these better conditions which the people of South Africa so anxiously
seek, will eventually be found within the greater tolerance among our
people for each other's views and in a growing, well-managed economy.

In his speech the President mentioned some of the prerequisites for a
peaceful and prosperous South Africa. He placed major emphasis on the need
to develop the disadvantaged section of our population, especially those in
rural areas. We must, however, move away from the two nation concept in
this regard and bridge the rich-poor divide or else the mistakes made in
our past will only repeat themselves.

Tolerance of each other's views and greater understanding of each other's
background, our dreams, our ideals and also our fears, are essential in
understanding each other with empathy. This could become the mortar to
cement the bricks of a greater trust between individuals into a monument of
achievement and create victory over poverty and shelter us against the
aggression and crime which are so rampant at present.

In his address the President spoke of what people should do to facilitate
and help guide the future. I would like to suggest some actions that the
Government could take in this regard. In the limited time at my disposal, I
can only concentrate on two aspects. A tremendous potential exists within
human and natural resources in our rural areas. Up to now our Government
has not succeeded in fully unleashing this potential. In fact, the
intentions of Government in this regard are treated with mistrust in some
circles and therefore are not supported by all the necessary role-players.

Binne die landbousektor, veral die kommersiële been daarvan, is daar baie
kundigheid en vermoë. Die gereelde vergaderings van die President, Agri SA
en ander organisasies, getuig hiervan. Die saamwerkideaal kry egter nie in
die praktyk werklik beslag en rigting nie en word deur 'n hele reeks
faktore versteur. Ek wil klem lê op een of twee.

Die eerste is ondeurdagte uitsprake van leiers aan albei kante, en die
ander is die bestaan en proklamasie van 'n aantal wette wat in die breë nie
onaanvaarbaar is nie, maar elemente bevat wat krapperigheid by kommersiële
boere veroorsaak. Die aanbieding daarvan deur regeringswoordvoerders dra
ook by tot baie misverstande. Dit word deur die meeste wit boere as 'n vorm
van gesofistikeerde wraak teen hulle vertolk, wat moet dien as 'n middel om
boerderyomstandighede verder te bemoeilik en om hulle uiteindelik van die
grond af weg te kry.

Hulle verkeer verder onder die indruk dat die regering nie veel omgee vir
kommersiële boere en hul probleme nie. Op hul beurt maak boere weer kras
uitsprake sonder om ook die sin te sien in vele van die nuwe voorskrifte
van die regering. Dit ontlok weer 'n teenreaksie van regeringskant. Só
broei die misverstand voort en verval ons al meer in die moeras van
wantroue.

Wanneer die Minister van Arbeid tot die debat toetree, soos tydens sy
onlangse besoek aan die Noord-Kaap en uitsprake maak soos byvoorbeeld dat
as boere nie wil saamwerk of gehoor gee aan wette nie, hulle gepenaliseer
sal word; en boonop byvoeg dat as hulle hul nie aanpas by die nuwe Suid-
Afrika nie, hulle sal sterf, skep dit nie vertroue vir samewerking nie.

In dieselfde asem wil ek ook die Minister van Arbeid bedank vir die feit
dat hy die opmerking teruggetrek en verskoning daarvoor gevra het. Hierdie
optrede gee my en andere hoop dat daar aan beide kante van die Raad tog die
begrip en wil is om groter sensitiwiteit en verdraagsaamheid in ons optrede
te weerspieël. Daarsonder kan ons Ikabod skryf oor die toekoms.

'n Beter lewe vir al die inwoners sal nie verkry word deur bloot wette te
maak nie. Dit sal deur die werking van ekonomiese kragte en deur
samewerking verkry word.

Ek wil vir die agb President sê daar bestaan 'n ernstige behoefte dat hy na
baie van hierdie wette moet kyk. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[Within the agricultural sector, especially the commercial branch thereof,
there is a lot of expertise and ability. The regular meetings of the
President, Agri SA and other organisations, attest to this. However, the
ideal of working together is not really gaining substance and direction in
practice and is being impeded by a whole range of factors. I want to
emphasise one or two of these factors.

The first is thoughtless remarks from leaders of both sides and the other
is the existence and proclamation of a number of laws which generally are
not unacceptable, but contain elements which cause uneasiness amongst
commercial farmers. The presentation thereof by Government spokespeople
also contributes to many misunderstandings. It is seen by many white
farmers as a form of sophisticated revenge against them, which should serve
as a means to make farming conditions even more difficult and eventually to
drive them from their land.

They are also under the impression that the Government does not care much
about commercial farmers and their problems. For their part farmers are
making extreme remarks without also seeing the sense in many of the new
regulations of the Government. This evokes a counter-reaction from the
Government. In this manner the misunderstandings incubates and we start
degenerating into the swamp of suspicion.

When the Minister of Labour joins the debate and makes remarks, as he did
during his recent visit to the Northern Cape, for example that if farmers
do not want to co-operate or obey the laws, they will be penalised for
that; and goes on to say that if they do not adapt to the new South Africa,
they will die, this does not create confidence for co-operation.

In the same breath I would also like to thank the Minister of Labour for
the fact that he retracted the remark and apologised. This action gives me
and others hope that there is indeed understanding and the will on both
sides of the House to reflect greater sensitivity and tolerance in our
actions. Without that we can write nothing good about the future.

A better life for all the inhabitants will not be achieved by merely making
laws. It will be achieved through the working of economic forces and
through co-operation.

I want to tell the hon the President that there is a serious need for him
to examine many of these laws.]

As the President himself suggested, there is an urgent need to revisit some
of the Acts on the Statute Book.

My time has expired, and I can only end by saying that the farmers are
singing a revolutionary song that is known to the President, only with
different words, namely ``Give us hope, Joanna.'' [Applause.]

Mr J H JEFFERY: Madam Speaker, hon President, hon members of this House, in
his address last Friday the President made a call to all of us to dedicate
this year to building unity in action for change, in order to build a new
society.

In the course of this debate a number of assertions have been made, in
particular by some members of the opposition, on the issue of patriotism
and the relationship between Parliament and the executive, and I want to
deal with these issues in my contribution to this debate.

In his speech, the President stated of our country, and I quote:


  We its citizens, who are very close to the coalface of change, may not
  easily see the steady transformation that informs all aspects of our
  national life.

It seems that it is foreigners who have to point out to us that we are our
own worst enemies, that the image we project here and abroad is one of
negativism and pessimism whilst we ignore the real progress that has been
made in transforming our society for the better. This syndrome is,
unfortunately, particularly prevalent amongst white citizens.

We only need to look at our history for some explanation as to where this
negative attitude comes from. Apartheid separated whites from blacks and
prevented whites from regarding their black compatriots as fellow human
beings. Black South Africans were portrayed as subhumans who had to be
feared. At the same time white South Africans were subjected to a barrage
of propaganda on the dangers of the ANC and its allies and what terrible
things would happen to them and their families if the ANC were to come to
power. Young white males were conscripted into the SA Defence Force to
protect their women and children by going and fighting this enemy in
Angola, Namibia and Mozambique.

Suddenly, in 1990, negotiations with this enemy began which resulted in the
nonracial elections of 1994. Within the space of a few years white South
Africans found themselves led by the man denounced by the hon Mr Van
Schalkwyk's predecessors as a terrorist. The old flag was gone. Even Die
Stem was now joined in a new national anthem with Nkosi Sikelela.

As a result of this culture shock, this fundamental change of values, it is
not surprising that many white South Africans find it difficult to accept
the black President. This may be either consciously or subconsciously.
[Interjections.]

Although it is now difficult to find anyone who actually supported
apartheid or who admits to being racist, the evidence of this is not hard
to find. [Interjections.] We hear it on the radio during phone-in comments,
we read it in the newspapers in the letters columns ...

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: You should see the racists in your party.

Mr J H JEFFERY: As a white South African I have experienced it as well
during many routine daily activities, going into a shop where only whites
are present and hearing racist jokes being told; standing in a queue at the
autobank where a black grandmother is battling to use the machine and one
white person in the queue looks at another, assuming that one is as
frustrated as he or she is at having to queue with black people.
[Interjections.]

If we are to build unity in action for change it is the duty of all of us
here, particularly those parties representing those in our society who find
it difficult to accept this change, to take active steps to help them into
the new South Africa. [Interjections.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: You should start in your own backyard.

Mr J H JEFFERY: The recent report of the public accounts committee on the
Auditor-General's report on arms procurement has focused attention on
Parliament's oversight role and the relationship between Parliament and the
executive.

The Constitution is clear on this matter. Parliament has the power to pass
legislation in terms of section 44 of the Constitution. In terms of section
55, the National Assembly must provide mechanisms to ensure that the
executive is accountable to it and that it performs oversight over the
executive. [Interjections.] This accountability - to the members in the DP
- which is performed by members of the executive reporting to Parliament
and answering questions does not mean that Parliament can instruct the
executive to do certain things.

This can only be done through legislation. The relationship between
Parliament and the executive - the DP should perhaps read the Constitution
- is a persuasive one, not a directive one. While the exact relationship
will be fleshed out in the course of debate and over time, the broad
parameters are clear. My colleague the hon Ms Chohan-Kota will speak more
on this later in the debate.
It is also not the opposition that holds the executive accountable; it is
Parliament itself. The hon Mr Leon referred in his speech to the contract
entered into between the ANC and the people of South Africa in the
elections of 1994. In doing so, he seems to have forgotten the increased
support from the people of South Africa for that contract that was given to
the ANC in the 1999 elections. [Interjections.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Think about December 2000!

Mr J H JEFFERY: Nevertheless, the ANC's election manifesto was to root out,
without fear or favour, corruption in the public and private sectors, in
our own organisation and in society as a whole. This is part of the mandate
on which members of the ANC were elected to this House, and this is
something which they will obviously uphold. As part of this commitment to
rooting out corruption, and going back to the 1994 mandate, the ANC with
its then 62,6% majority led a constitution-making process that resulted in
a constitution with checks and balances, to facilitate exposing corruption.
We have a Bill of Rights, with the right to information. We have
independent institutions such as the Public Protector and the Auditor-
General, designed to deal with this as well.

I have not read any accounts of the self-appointed lone fighters against
corruption in this House, the hon Leon, Van Schalkwyk or Andrew, attempting
to introduce amendments to this effect to the 1983 constitution, which was
the constitution before 1994. In spite of this, members of the opposition
have spread a number of misconceptions. We have had the hon De Lille
threatening in a SAPA report on 26 December to take the President to court
for violating ``a unanimous parliamentary decision that Heath be part of
the investigation''. She goes on to say that she called on parliamentary
Speaker Dr Frene Ginwala immediately to intervene to inform Mbeki and
Maduna that they were violating a parliamentary resolution.

We have had similar assertions in this debate by the hon Holomisa,
including one to the effect that the executive was reneging on a decision
to have the four units involved. He went on to say that the executive could
not investigate itself.

Madam Speaker, the facts in this matter are clear. As you yourself stated
in a letter to the Deputy President on 29 January, printed in the ATCs of
31 January 2001, and I quote:


  The Report ...

  That is, the report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts -


  ... does not recommend that any or all of these bodies must be included,
  nor does it refer to the procedural and constitutional issues that would
  arise should Parliament wish to involve or instruct either independent or
  executive agencies or organisations in its enquiries.

As I said before, should Parliament have passed such a resolution, it would
have been a persuasive one, not a directive one. The executive runs the
executive, Parliament runs the legislature; there is a separation of
powers.

We know of an investigation conducted by the Auditor-General, the Public
Protector and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Hon Holomisa was present
at the meeting of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts last week when
the Auditor-General's Office gave its report on the progress of the
investigation. It is baffling to comprehend how this amounts to the
executive investigating itself, as the prosecuting authority, in terms of
the Constitution, exercises its functions without fear, favour or
prejudice, and the other two bodies are independent institutions in terms
of Chapter 9 of our Constitution.

For the sake of our country, the opposition parties have a duty to play a
constructive role. This includes constructive criticism and not fabricating
or distorting the facts, as appears to be the case in the two examples I
have mentioned. Hon Seremane spoke about the fact that the DP, too, is a
legitimate voice of the voters. That is accepted, but equally it must be
accepted that in terms of the election that brought us to this Parliament,
they represent 9,55% of the voters and the ANC 66,4%. [Interjections.] The
voters of this country gave the ANC an overwhelming mandate to govern:
govern the ANC must, and govern the ANC will.

It is accepted that the DP and the New NP predominantly represent white
voters, the people who supported the apartheid policies over the years by
overwhelmingly voting for the NP. [Interjections.] It is crucial that, if
this country is to unite and move forward, the leaders of these sections of
our community must ... [Interjections.]

HON MEMBERS: Must what?

Mr J H JEFFERY: They must assist these sections of our community to join,
as the President has said, in a campaign to become activists in a historic
process to transform ours into a truly nonracial country. The leaders of
these people should not feed the people's fears with ``swart gevaar''
tactics. They should not encourage their feelings of negativity and racism,
as the very grey hon Mr Afro-pessimism Andrew has done, by perpetually
attacking anything the ANC Government does or by fabricating facts. They
need to engage the Government constructively on matters that will make
South Africa a better place for all. They need to heed the President's call
for unity and action for change. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I am not sure whether the Chair heard the
remark by the hon member who has just spoken. He accused Mr Andrew of
``fabricating facts''. [Interjections.] That, I submit, is unparliamentary.
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! I do not recall it. If you have it in your written
speech and it has been said, would you withdraw it? If not, I will be
consulting Hansard.

Mr J H JEFFERY: Madam Speaker, I will withdraw it.

The SPEAKER: Thank you. [Interjections.] Order!

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, Mr President, hon members,
when during a weekend one walks deeper among the mkhukhu of Lwandle, just
outside Cape Town, one's hair occasionally stands on end. One feels like
turning and running. Every other mkhukhu is a shebeen from which competing
music blasts at full throttle. Every other adult moves or dances in a daze
from all the noise and the obvious abuse of substances. One sees in motion,
massive attempts at escapism.

One sees the toddlers in Lwandle playing in the filth and squalor they
cannot escape from. These are our people. The speech by the President and
the optimistic figures and statistics contained therein ought to have
meaning to them as well. He is their President. But did it have meaning to
them? Did it have meaning that the economy gathered momentum in the third
quarter of 2000, and that the consumer inflation rate was 5,3% last year,
as compared to 15,3% in 1991?

Probably not. That is not because it is high-flown erudite stuff, but
because the divisions in our society are still such that a boon for one
section is at best a nonevent for the other. It is because those optimistic
figures and statistics had no tangible, visible and obvious impact on their
immediate and material condition.

This, once more, emphasises the enormous amount of work we face in this
country. It is a hard enough challenge to grow the economy, but in our case
one still has to ensure that the fruits of that economic growth are
distributed in a manner that benefits the people of Lwandle, as well as
those of Sea Point and Constantia.

Also, the fact that the street kids one finds everywhere in the cities of
our country are of one colour, that the images of cholera on our television
screens are black, and that all the people of Lwandle and other places of a
similar description are black, means that our quest for an equal and
integrated society, as envisaged by the Constitution, does not yet exist.
But because we do not want integration in the gutter, equality in
diarrhoea, dehydration and cholera, or solidarity in the squalor of
Lwandle, we should devote special attention to the eradication of the
legacy of centuries of oppression, which is so manifest in the black
community.

The line in the speech of the President, which talks about moving the
economy onto a high-growth path, raising employment levels and reducing
poverty and persistent inequalities needs to inform and drive almost
everything we do. That high growth path of economic growth must go through
Lwandle, Nongoma, Nzhele, Dinokana, Mankurwane and Botshabelo, so that the
economic figures and statistics of the future can increasingly begin to
talk to us as well.

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Madam Speaker, hon President, comrades
and Director-General Nogxina, our Government's macroeconomic balance has
paid off. It has created the space and possibility for Government and other
stakeholders to focus on micro socioeconomic challenges, while continuing
to focus on macroeconomic stability which we have to maintain.

Last year the President committed the Government to an initiative that
would seek to address systematically, and in a sustainable way, rural
poverty and underdevelopment. This was to build on the initiatives already
started by this Government since 1994, and on the work of other social
partners who have dedicated time and resources to this course.

The Presidency, through the Office of the Deputy President, has dedicated
time to and has focused on the Integrated Rural Development Strategy, which
will pool us all together in Government and enable us to focus on the task
of improving the quality of life of our rural people, mobilising other
stakeholders and doing so in partnership.

During this process the Presidency worked through Government clusters, and
right from the start the process sought to deepen integration as an
important prerequisite for effective rural delivery. The process of
arriving at a set of measures now adopted by national Government started by
evaluating the progress and limitations of the initiatives undertaken since
1994. From that exercise we concluded that of the initiatives undertaken to
date, the critical success factors included were specifically the
following. Firstly, integration and co-ordination; secondly,
decentralisation and involvement of communities and local government; and
thirdly, demand-driven initiatives.

Out of the ongoing work that Government is doing we also learnt that the
single most important service Government provides to the rural poor is
welfare services and that there is a need not only to prioritise the
outreach of welfare services and its efficient delivery, but also to
dramatically change the opportunities in rural areas so that many more
people will not need to depend on welfare services. We need to
systematically revise the impact of more than 100 years of migrant labour,
which was deliberately and ruthlessly enforced amongst our people. It
destroyed the African peasant and took away the land - a story told very
vividly by Sol Plaatje - thanks to the hon members on this side of the
House. What we are therefore doing in the implementation of the Integrated
Rural Development Strategy is to reverse this legacy.

We also looked further afield and learnt from international experience.
Rural development, even without the complexities that we have in South
Africa, is a complex undertaking. It must be built on well-throughout
interlocking initiatives, a combination of bottom-up and centrally driven
initiatives aimed at supporting and enhancing local demand-driven
initiatives.

The vision that has been outlined for rural areas of South Africa is that
of socially cohesive, resilient and stable rural communities that are
economically empowered, productive and contributing sustainably to South
Africa's growth and global competitiveness. This is the call we are making
at the beginning of the African Century. This vision gives us the agenda.

This is also a microspatial strategy which will target defined nodes of
underdevelopment, using district councils as entry points. It recognises
the general problems of underdevelopment and seeks to build on unique
strengths of different local communities.

Furthermore, most rural problems present themselves as social ones, but
sustainable solutions are socioeconomic, hence the strategy places great
emphasis on building diverse rural economies with a mixture of private and
public sector solutions, the creation of productive infrastructure and
remunerative programmes within a macroeconomic framework.

The pillars of the strategy are integration, co-ordination,
decentralisation, demand-driven partnerships, diversified economies and
enhanced social infrastructure and institutions. Cross-cutting high impact
programmes have also been identified from existing programmes of Government
and those outside Government, as well as new programmes that need to be
developed.

In order to hit the ground running, we have isolated those cross-cutting
programmes which can be rolled out without delay. These are the settlement
of our people on productive land and agricultural support; broad-based
income generating initiatives and small, macro and medium enterprise
development; co-ordinated access to affordable finance from public and
private sources, as well as the enhancement of personal finance; the basic
roll-out, in particular roads, water, shelter, energy and telecoms; social
assistance and security, in order to ensure that what we have achieved in
welfare services can be improved; affirmative procurement which can
contribute to high quality rural productive capacity, as well as ensuring
that rural economies have market access; human resource development which
will build on and enhance local capacity, and a policy that will facilitate
secondment, mentorship and volunteer schemes with incentives where
necessary; and lastly, capacity-building for local government and local
institutions and the building of dynamic traditional leadership
institutions.

These are the programmes that will be targeting rural communities across
the country. Relevant departments with appropriate mandates from the
national and local departments will be mobilised for effective
implementation. In many cases, these programmes are in place and need
greater focus and integration.

In addition to this cross-cutting high impact programme, additional
Government services and products that can be branded have also been
identified for inclusion in the rural basket of services. Most of these are
products which have been tested by departments and are now being reviewed
and adjusted to work in the identified nodes. Through cluster co-
ordination, synergies between the products would be enhanced such that they
are delivered as a comprehensive service that is responsive and demand
driven.

The following are examples of such products: Abet, the rural housing
programme, agricultural support centres, women in construction, working for
water, the land care programme, Phambili Nombane, technology centres, local
tourism information centres, community production centres and mini grids,
to mention  but a few. This also implies that departments will budget as
clusters rather than individually in many cases. To deliver these services,
the Government has also identified the nodes that it will initially begin
with, and these were announced by the President.

The identification of the nodes was based on the degree of poverty in those
areas, lack of basic services, institutional capacity, skills, limited
local government capacity and opportunities that can be identified in those
areas for building and stimulating growth and development. The strategy
advocates diversified rural economies as against agrarian development. In
his speech, the President indicated priority industries for our country,
namely, agriculture, tourism, information and communication and cultural
industries. What makes these industries a priority includes the fact that
they are also relevant to job creation, facilitation of entry points into
the mainstream economy by rural areas and the fact that they are wealth
creators in general.

All of the priority industries will be key to and have a special role in
the rural strategy. The Cabinet has also identified input costs which need
to be kept competitive in order to build a robust South African economy,
and these are energy, transport and Telkom. All of these are also
identified as basic infrastructure support services for a successful rural
development strategy. The Minister of Finance has already allocated R6
billion for infrastructure development, out of which rural development will
also benefit.

The strategy also argues for taking full advantage of natural resources in
rural areas, which in some cases are the only assets that can contribute
significantly to the development of these areas. These will be looked into
in the context of the integrated development plans which exist in many
local authorities, which as of now are also required by regulation. Mining,
agriculture and tourism will also be identified as important natural
industries which need to be exploited to the full in many of the rural
areas.

Political parties are also urged to unite around the implementation of the
strategy and mobilise their local leadership. The ANC and IFP, who enjoy
the overwhelming support of the rural masses, have already committed
themselves to this task. So, I do not know what the hon member Gibson is
talking about by giving his imagined support, when he has not won any
support in the rural areas. If the rural people wanted him, they would have
chosen him - instead, they have chosen us.

Based on the indicated criteria that the Government has identified for the
nodes, the following district councils and municipalities have been
identified: O R Tambo, Bizana, Tabankulu, Lusikisiki, Flagstaff, Port St
Johns, Libode,  Ngqeleni, Qumbu, Tsolo, Umtata, Umzinyantsi, Umkhanyakude,
Ugku and the district municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal, which include
Dundee, Nqutu, Pomeroy, Greytown, Kranskop, Emanguzi and others. The
important message that we need to take with us is that not everybody in
these nodes will necessary be poor and therefore targeted. This will
facilitate targeting by those district councils.

The role of the Department of Provincial and Local Government cannot be
emphasised enough in this initiative, hence it will play a critical co-
ordinating and championing role in driving this strategy. A link between
urban and rural development is also envisaged in the development and
implementation of the strategy. The process of rolling out the key nodes
will unfold over the next two years. It is anticipated that we intend to
roll out about 30 nodes by the year 2003 and could have the capacity to
reach out to more than 7 million people. If one looks at this in
conjunction with our intention to also roll out the urban renewal strategy,
one can see a very co-ordinated strategy to target all our poor people in
the rural and urban areas.

The IDT has been identified as a support institution which will work
closely with the relevant department, ensuring that there is enough
capacity, especially on the ground, to implement the strategy. The strategy
has an accountable approach. All people working in the strategy will be
expected to work according to the plan. The Presidency will regularly
appraise the strategy, ensuring that the barriers are removed and that best
practices are transmitted to other areas. We would like to leave the House
with a clear understanding that it is our unshakable commitment that in our
lifetime, an African child in Tabankulu, Riviersonderend and Mhlangana will
be proud because we have made that possible. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, Mr President, Deputy President and
fellow South Africans, I rise to add my voice to the support for the
President's statement of last Friday. I have noted, as I listened to hon
members' positive observations, that it was a well-measured statement in
terms of its tone and was acceptable all round. I am happy about that, but
I do hope that it does not imply that as we move ahead with the painful
task of transforming our society, we will shy away from time to time from
telling each other some unpleasant truths.

Ours has been a very unfortunate history. If we are going to proceed to
transform it and confront some of the realities that we have inherited,
from time to time we need a President who is going to say some very
unpleasant things, not in order to destroy, but to raise the level of our
vigilance, focusing us on the painful task that still has to be performed
to make ours a better society. I therefore hope that the President will not
in future shy away from confronting that task when it does arise.

The recent debates - if I may turn a little bit to the strategic arms
package - have been a very significant development for our country. I think
as a people we ought to congratulate ourselves on the fact that for the
first in our history we can engage so robustly in debates on issues which
in the past, we would never have had the right to say as much about as we
have said this time. [Applause.] I say this because sometimes we forget
that even white South Africans have been saying things that they would not
have been allowed to say in the old order. So, all of us have been victims
of a terrible system. The fact that we have been able to do that recently,
is an indication that the words of the President that we are slowly
drifting away from an unhappy and unfortunate past, are indeed very true.

This debate has tested our commitment to our Constitution and has compelled
us to understand the democratic institutions that were set up in Chapter 9.
This has really tested all of us. In doing so it has helped us to
understand our Constitution and the work we have done up to now, far better
than would otherwise have been the case.

With regard to this matter, I would like to say the following.  As we
exercise these new freedoms which we did not have in the past, it is not
unlikely - and is, in fact, more than probable - that some of us will go to
excesses and extremes. Some of us may not be doing this in bad faith, but
simply because it is something new and people are therefore learning to
exercise that freedom. This is important. However, I think that South
Africans must be careful that in exercising these freedoms, we must develop
parameters to define how much further we can go than we could in the past.

We cannot possibly set up an institution such as the Presidency of the
country and then have citizens who say the things which were said here in
this House about that Office. This is not an exercise in democracy, but an
abuse of the rights that have been granted. [Applause.] Members of the
House are going to play a vital role in assisting our people to come to
terms with this newfound freedom. This is because the pronouncements that
we all make, tend to be accepted as what is acceptable.
To get back to what I was saying, we should be attentive in what we do. We
all met in this House and produced a White Paper on Defence policy. We
proceeded to the next step, which was the Defence Review, and determined
what the country needed. We then proceeded to the acquisition process.
However, in debates recently, there have been members of Parliament - and
one of them is not here. I had hoped that she would be here. I asked her to
return to the House as I was going to speak - who have appeared on
television to debate this issue before the nation. This member asks how we
arrived at the conclusion that we needed these arms, yet the whole process
of review was carried out in this House and the hon member was also in the
House. This confuses people abroad and voters. We need to remember these
things.

We also need to acquaint ourselves with issues, because this acquisition
was dealt with in a very special way. Cabinet was the only body which took
decisions with regard to this acquisition. A subcommittee chaired by the
Deputy President was set up. This subcommittee was composed of the
Ministers of Defence, Trade and Industry, Finance and Public Enterprises.
No single member of Cabinet could ever take decisions on this issue. It was
always processed by the officials through the subcommittee of Cabinet and
the decisions were then taken by the Cabinet. What Mrs De Lille has said in
the country about us lying to voters about issues relating to the price of
the acquisition relates to decisions that have been taken by the Cabinet.

To suggest that this country has a Cabinet that can sit in session and take
a resolution that we are now going to lie to the nation about the prices of
these acquisitions, is self-defeating and destructive. It is destructive
especially in this period of a globalising world. No government that is
corrupt or that is tainted by corruption has a future under globalisation.

Corrupt regimes could survive during the Cold War period. This could happen
and it did happen. However, the globalising world in which we find
ourselves at this time will not tolerate a corrupt government. South
Africans, therefore, must be careful not to suggest that their Government
is corrupt, unless they have evidence. If anyone can find some concrete
evidence on which to base his or her statement, he or she must do that.

But I do not believe there is a single member in this House who wants to
say South Africa's Government is corrupt purely to discredit it, because
investors will go, and so on ... [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Who said that?

The MINISTER: Well, members may create that impression intentionally or
unintentionally. All I am saying is that members should exercise their new-
found freedom in such a way that they do not destroy their own. They do not
want to do that.

However, I should also say that corruption is not new in this country. It
did not come with this Government. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: The NP invented it.

The MINISTER: The only thing is that there has been more freedom to talk
about corruption now and that, in fact, the party in power is leading the
discussion and confronting this weakness that we inherited.

Think back to the information scandal and the slush funds. Large amounts of
South Africa's taxpayers' money were taken here and given away. No South
African could say anything. [Interjections.] If there is corruption which
supersedes that, I do not know of it. So we have had corruption. One could
go on to mention the pass laws, the municipalities in the townships, the
Bantustans - I am not going to talk about that - and then, of course, the
slush funds I have referred to. We have inherited a huge culture of
corruption.

Under the leadership of the President, the Government and this Parliament,
we are now on a crusade to arrest this thing and eliminate it. Let us work
together. Let us confront those realities. [Interjections.] Let us work
together on these issues.

Some of the people who are sitting here were paymasters of the killers.
[Interjections.] Therefore, it should be appreciated that we are cleaning
up a country that we found in a total mess so, I think, there must be a
little bit of humility sometimes.

When one is dealing with former prisoners who were eating izinkobe,
[unstamped corn], while those members were sitting in this Parliament
writing poetry to its armies, and so on; when one sometimes looks at former
victims of that kind, one must also look at himself or herself and say: How
can we join hands  and take the country forward?

I appealed to the members some time ago when we came here and said that we
must always think that we are about to perform a sacred duty. We must speak
on behalf of our people and work to take our country forward. We are
elected, among other things, to support this President, so that South
Africa succeeds under his leadership.

Indeed, where he is wrong objectively, we will say: ``Mr President, we do
not think that this is correct.'' I work with the President daily, and he
is open to that. But I do not think that that freedom has been exercised in
the responsible manner that it should be. [Applause.]

Inkosi M W HLENGWA: Madam Speaker, Mr President, Mr Deputy President and
hon members of the National Assembly, my colleague the hon Mr Musa Zondi,
the Deputy Minister of Public Works, spoke passionately about the need to
transform crises into opportunities and the role that the IFP intends to
play to make this possible, and to enable anyone who wishes to do so to
make a contribution towards this goal.

I wish to speak about one such crisis which the President, in his address,
touched on. This crisis involves the Presidency and it is for the
Presidency to find a solution which may transform it into a real
opportunity.

I refer to the crisis which flows from the overlapping of the powers and
functions of the municipalities with those of traditional authorities. This
issue has been on the table for many years, during which time it was
avoided and denied in spite of traditional leaders constantly pointing to
it in all stages of the national debates, including those of the
Constitutional Assembly and in the process of drafting the White Paper on
Local Government and its ensuing legislation.

For many years, it was denied that the establishment of municipalities
would take over and obliterate the majority of the powers and functions
exercised by traditional authorities. At best, the public documentation
issued by the department admitted that there was an overlap of functions
which had to be investigated further.

However, after the matter was taken over by the technical committee, on the
advice of the President, it emerged that the internal documentation of the
department clearly spelt out that, in the absence of a constitutional
legislative amendment which directly vests powers and functions in
traditional authorities, the establishment of municipalities in rural areas
would mark the last and final chapter in the obliteration of all powers and
functions of traditional leadership.

A fundamental gap existed between the factual and legal reality on the one
hand, and what was publicly professed was represented on the other. In the
end, the President sought clarity, and a technical committee was appointed
which highlighted the issue. It must be stressed that the crisis arising
out of this overlapping of powers and functions is not something that
affects the traditional leaders alone, but is a crisis in delivery,
development and growth in the rural areas.

Traditional authorities are the cornerstones of the entire system of
governance in rural areas, and the obliteration of their powers will spell
the demise of the laws, mores and tools of societal organisation which hold
traditional communities together, without which economic growth and social
upliftment is going to be highly problematic.

Municipalities can only operate in terms of statutory law. What they are
going to be doing in rural areas will conflict clash with the laws and
customs which govern our people and shape our way of life. It is a crisis
which affects the country. It is a crisis which affects the Presidency,
which has the final responsibility for its resolution. We look to the
Presidency to have the courage to deal with it as effectively as required.

On 16 May, the President wrote to the traditional leaders to commit himself
to solving this crisis, indicating his willingness to amend the
Constitution and any relevant legislation to protect the powers and
functions of the traditional authorities. He even indicated that the
establishment of municipalities in rural areas could be delayed pending the
finalisation of these amendments. Since then, negotiations and discussions
on this issue have been plunged into the quicksands of bureaucratic delays,
procrastination, obfuscation, and delaying tactics.

However, on the very same day on which the election date was declared, the
President made a further commitment to the traditional leaders. Because of
this, he did not object to the proclamation of the election date. The
President formally promised that he would apply his mind to design a
solution and formulate the required legislation and constitutional
amendments to deal with the crisis. He clearly stated that the solution
that he would design would protect or restore the local government powers
and functions of traditional authorities.

This commitment of his was captured in a contemporaneous letter written by
traditional leaders to his director-general, designated by him to take the
matter further. The process was again delayed, confused and obfuscated
within the meanderings of Government, leading to the production of a Bill
which had little to do with the crisis and solved none of the real problems
at hand. That called for the intervention of the Presidency once again,
this time in the person of the Deputy President who attempted to rectify
the shortcomings in the Bill. In the end, it was not possible to do this in
the absence of a constitutional amendment.

Simply put, the problem was that without a constitutional amendment, a Bill
restoring the local government powers and functions of traditional
authorities with the consequent limitation of those of the municipalities
would be unconstitutional. A Bill which would not achieve such a purpose
would be useless. For this reason, on the eve of the local government
elections, the matter could not be taken further and no other course
remained open but to once again reach an agreement defining the parameters
within which this crisis had to be solved.

On 30 November, the Deputy President, in the committee delegated by Cabinet
to deal with this issue, agreed with traditional leaders on a joint
document committing the Government to amending both Chapters 7 and 12 of
the Constitution, to enable traditional authorities to have local
government powers. In order to facilitate the work of the Presidency and to
show how simple it would be to accommodate traditional leaders if a genuine
political will to do so existed, traditional leaders have taken it upon
themselves to seek legal advice and draft the actual text of the required
constitutional amendment. This text is available to anyone who is
interested in it. It shows that minimal amendments to the Constitution will
be required to avoid the unfolding of a major crisis. Once again, I have
made my contribution to this issue and my heart is heavy.

Surely, this quotation compels the South African nation to be open-minded.
In his book, Africa Betrayed, George B N Ayittey states:


  Despite their rhetoric, most African leaders did not value their own
  heritage and the significance of their indigenous systems. Instead, they
  copied alien systems to develop their countries. The new leaders stripped
  the traditional chiefs of their authority and actually set out to destroy
  indigenous systems through various government policies and civil wars.


  These new leaders acted as if Africa had no history, no culture, no
  native institutions and no indigenous revolutionaries for its people to
  salute.

I would like to say to the President that the time has come to prove that
Chapter 12 of our Constitution was not intended to be rhetoric of the
highest order. It is incumbent on this sane Government to amend it.

This Government must avoid portraying the institution of traditional
leadership as the victim of liberation. We must avoid another blood bath
since this Government is expected to face the challenge of creating and
controlling a permanent season of peace and stability for the benefit of
our country and its posterity.

We must now take this process forward by recognising that, beneath this
crisis, lies a great opportunity. Traditional authorities have an important
contribution to make in promoting economic development and social
upliftment in rural areas. The legislation which Parliament will need to
consider this year will have an enormous impact in charting the way forward
towards the establishment, in South Africa, of a genuinely African and yet
truly modern state.

Mhlonishwa Mongameli wezwe laseNingizimu Afrika, uma sikhuluma ngezindaba
ezinjengalezi kuningi umuntu akucabangayo. Ziningi nezindaba
esizikhumbulayo ezenzeka ezingaba wusizo kulesi sikhathi.

paragraphs follows.)

[Hon President of South Africa, when one talks about such issues, one
thinks about lots of things. One remembers many things that happened in the
past which might be helpful nowadays.

I remember the story of a head of a certain homestead who liked his family
very much. One day a member of his family fell ill.  Fortunately, there
were trees within range of his homestead. Some had been planted and others
grew naturally. Since a member of his family was ill, he examined these
trees, searching for the tree that he could use as a herb to treat his
ailing relative.  Then he saw the tree that he thought would help, cut it
down and used it. This herb did not cure the sickness of his ailing
relative. The owner of the homestead decided to go and search for herbs in
the surrounding hills. His friends used to come and visit him. It so
happened that one day a friend came to him and said: "You have been
experiencing terrible hardship. This ailing member of your family is about
to die. The tree that you can use as a herb, is here among the trees that
are within range of your homestead.'' Of course everything was done as this
traveller had advised. Then the ailing relative was cured.

In telling this story, I am trying to say to the President that he is in
the same situation with regard to his party. It is possible that the person
who has been appointed to solve the issue of traditional leaders might say
he does not see clearly, he does not know what to do and he does not know
how to rectify the situation. What I am saying is that the hon President is
lucky, because within the ANC there are experts on this issue, people who
are amakhosi themselves. There are amakhosi who even hold law degrees and
are capable of solving this problem within a split second. It will be
better if one hon member, because there cannot be two members from the ANC,
assists in this task which was assigned to this person who sometimes says
that he does not know what to do and he does not see the way forward.
However, it dismays me that an African can say he does not know about
traditional leadership, while he has his own origin here.

If I have addressed unkind words to the President, that is because of my
desire to see this issue resolved. I hope that all of us in this House wish
the President success in leading this country. We wish him success that
will emerge out of the happiness of every South Africans, including all
administrative structures which were there before the arrival of the
whites. We should not correct some of the things and leave others aside. We
need to build upon the traditional structures. Traditional leadership
belongs to this country, it does not belong to other places. [Applause.]]

Mrs W S NEWHOUDT-DRUCHEN: Madam Speaker, Comrade President and hon members,
I would like to take this opportunity to mention that Parliament still does
not cater completely for the needs of the members of the disabled
community, that is those who are deaf.

No interpreter was provided for a deaf visitor in the public gallery during
the President's speech at the opening of Parliament this year. Once again,
it has been pointed out that our hon President's speech was not interpreted
in sign language on TV, used by approximately 500 000 deaf South Africans
who all waited to know what the hon the President said. However, on the
positive side, we take note of the fact that Parliament has put new devices
in the elevators to enable and empower our hon members who are blind.

Today we continue to follow what the President said in 1999, that we are a
nation at work. As our President mentioned in his speech, slowly we are
moving away from the painful past, a painful past that has left the vast
majority of our population in poverty. The policies of apartheid has led to
a shameful legacy of human underdevelopment which will remain etched in the
collective consciousness of the world for a long time.

The level of poverty and inequality in South Africa is one part of that
legacy. Severe poverty, especially where there is a lack of access to clean
water, electricity, good health, and education, leads to different types of
disabilities, for example, a high rate of TB, HIV/Aids, cholera,
illiteracy, lack of family planning, child abuse, gangsterism, exclusion,
discrimination and negative attitudes.

Poverty is caused not only by a lack of sustainable and sufficient
financial income, but also by educational, social, political and economic
exclusion in the communities in which we live. Lack of access to proper
health care puts many, especially children, at risk of being infected with
easily preventable diseases which result in disabilities.

Poor children are often malnourished, which subjects them to increased
infection and, once they contract a disease, they will have little
resistance and, often, no access to proper treatment. They are more exposed
to inadequate sanitation, unsafe water and hazards in their homes, all of
which are health and life-threatening. Once a child is disabled, the family
sinks deeper into poverty. Poverty is closely linked to disempowerment. If
we could look into the causes of the high level of disempowerment found
amongst people with disabilities, we would start to understand the close
relationship between poverty, disability and exclusion better.

Let me also mention something that I saw on a TV programme for the deaf,
Signature, which is shown on Sundays. A mother of a disabled child was
interviewed. She started a home for multidisabled children. The home,
Tobego, in Orange Farm, in Gauteng, houses more than 30 disabled children
who have all been abandoned by families who live in poverty. It is our
responsibility as members of Parliament and members of society to make sure
that our children, whether disabled or not, have access to decent health,
education and good family and community support.

So far, I have seen no proof of the DA's efforts to help poor people
suffering from TB to gain access to the health care system. How can we, as
society and Government, contribute? Look at what has been achieved in
respect of the eradication of poverty, for example, poverty alleviation
programmes, including providing electricity, water, building houses and
community health clinics. These projects also include school feeding
schemes, land reform, tax reduction for the poor and the middle class,
providing monthly grants for poor people, and increasing the monetary value
of these grants.

Short-term projects include protecting the rights of farmworkers, children,
women and disabled people. Some of the long-term policies include reducing
the deficit and inflation. More incentives need to be provided to ensure
that local and foreign investors provide the economy with much-needed
capital investment. This is necessary to ensure that the economy grows
sufficiently to boost job creation and the redistribution of wealth and
resources, especially to the poorest of the poor.

With regard to health and crime, long-term programmes include combating
drug and alcohol abuse, as well as domestic violence against women,
disabled persons and the aged, and child abuse. These should be implemented
at schools. In the Western Cape, the DA provincial government prioritises
and spends more money on building centres such as the Waterfront and
Century City, to the exclusion of the needs of the township areas.
[Applause.]

In contrast, our President and the ANC emphasises the needs of the poor as
a priority. In fact, the DA mayor for Langeberg has already broken his
party's electoral promises and vowed not to provide free water and
electricity, whilst the ANC has already started to deliver. [Applause.] It
is clear that whilst the President and the ANC prioritises the needs of the
Khayelitshas and the Mitchells Plains, the DA promotes only the needs of
the Constantias and the Bishopscourts. [Applause.]

We have a national programme of action for children in South Africa,
covering areas such as HIV/Aids, disability, gender, peace and nonviolence.
In 1999 the month of October was declared welfare month with the theme
``Fight poverty together''. The main objective during this month was to
build an awareness of welfare services and to foster commitment and unity
between communities, NGOs, labour, business, local government and all other
sectors of civil society to fight poverty together. Key areas which need
more attention, however, are to provide more assistive devices to empower
disabled people and to further develop schools in poor areas by providing
more resources and better management.

The youth, women and disabled persons also need to be provided with more
opportunities. The quotas that are now legislated with regard to
affirmative action need to be vigorously applied. We need to empower our
people through development, training and employment. We continue to stand
behind our President in the continuing fight against poverty. [Applause.]

Adv A H GAUM: Madam Speaker, recently the Leader of the Opposition
challenged the President to give more than a cursory glance at education in
his opening address and to throw the same enormous energy into education
than he has thrown into other dubious issues. Sadly, he missed this
opportunity.

While the President plans to bridge the digital divide, the nation is
asking what he is planning to do about the fact that, according to the
World Competitiveness Yearbook 2000, our education system ranks last among
47 countries. While we celebrate with the President our country's higher
economic ranking, he has withheld from the nation ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Is the hon member prepared to take a question?

Adv A H GAUM: No! While we celebrate with the President our country's
higher economic ranking, he withheld from the nation that we ranked second
last as far as the adequacy of science education is concerned, second last
as regards the interests of the youth in science and technology and last
with respect to economic literacy.

Against this background, the fortunate 57% who passed matric last year
would like to know what the value of their matric certificate is, if only
14% of candidates received matric exemption and only 45% passed maths.
Those who still have to write their matric exams can hardly be inspired
without any commitment from the President to address the fact that 30% of
our teachers are under or unqualified, as well as the national crisis that
one out of five teachers is HIV-positive. [Interjections.]
If the President's Government fails to address and deliver the basics of
education, our nation will find it impossible to join him on the
information superhighway. In an attempt to convince the nation that the
Government is delivering as far as job creation is concerned, the President
stated that there was a net gain of 1,1 million jobs between 1996 and 1999.
However, he failed to mention that according to the September 2000 survey
of total employment and earnings, there was an annual decrease of 126 000
jobs in the formal nonagricultural sector between September 1999 and
September 2000.

While we welcome new initiatives announced by the President to create more
jobs, one of the most important keys towards job creation remains a
fundamental reviewing of our labour laws. It was therefore less encouraging
that the President only went so far as to make a second vague promise
without any indication of a timeframe for action in this regard. It is also
to be regretted that while the President announced the reviewing of
immigration laws to attract skills, no mention was made of whether and how
the Government intends to stem the tide of highly skilled South Africans
leaving the country.

If the President wants to gain credibility, he must practise what he
preaches. It is not credible to say that no African child should ever again
walk in fear of guns, tyrants and abuse, but then be photographed hand-in-
hand with tyrant Robert Mugabe and be silent while he is engaged in a
massive onslaught on the judiciary of his country. [Interjections.] And it
is not credible to say that the Government will fight corruption, but then
get rid of two champions of this cause, Willem Heath and Andrew Feinstein.
[Interjections.]

On the positive side, the President's address was encouraging because he
refrained from proceeding to divide the nation in the hope that it will
help the ANC to rule forever. We hope that these are the first signs of a
President who is willing to build on the foundation of reconciliation that
was laid by former Presidents Mandela and De Klerk, and Minister Buthelezi.
[Interjections.]

The truth is that many people in our country feel excluded. One such person
is Vanshi Moodley, an Indian girl who got six As in matric last year but
was denied access to a medical school because of the quotas this Government
enforces upon it. If the President wants all South Africans to pull their
weight to unite in action to change the future, it is unwise to continue to
alienate talented young people because of the past. All our people should
rather enter into a social contract that ensures equal opportunity and
expects social responsibility. He will be surprised how much goodwill such
a contract would instil in all communities.

The President's reference in his speech to schools that assist one another
would become a rule rather than an exception to the rule, and national
reconciliation would become the nation's vision, rather than Government
rhetoric. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr N N KEKANA: Madam Speaker, if there is one person who the Sunday Times
should regard as a mampara, it is certainly Adv Gaum. [Interjections.] What
he is not telling us - perhaps he does not know and somebody in the DA
should educate him in this regard - is that South Africa spends one fifth
of its budget on education, and this is one of the biggest budgets on
education in the world. [Interjections.] I think the hon member should
educate himself.

To the hon the President, the hon the Deputy President and hon members,
there is an upswing in the information and communications industry, greatly
encouraged by the state-of-the-nation address. The address by our President
will certainly put the sector on a higher growth rate.

We are greatly encouraged that the successful implementation of our
policies will stimulate growth and position the information and
communications technology sector to be the driver of our economic revival.
Information and communications are the crucial determinants of the pace of
social and economic change. It is evident that the ICT sector has an
important role to play in the development and reconstruction of our country
and the African continent as a whole.

In global trade the information and communications technology sector is the
fastest growing and is now the third largest after the financial service
sector and the health sector. The ICT sector creates opportunities for
African countries to leapfrog and integrate into the international markets.
The high mobility of capital and international trade requires access to
communications tools. Many companies and businesses are borderless and
stateless in their operations and require electronic communications
services for their global trade and investment.

South Africa is the gateway to the African continent and is one of the
leading countries in information and communications technology. After a
decade of telecommunications reforms, more people are being connected to
basic telephony than ever before in the history of Africa. We should not
underestimate the possibilities and potential that satellite and other new
wireless technologies can offer the African continent.

Recent major investments by South African communications corporations in
other African countries are unprecedented, and signify the globalisation of
the African information and communications technology market. South African
companies understand the African market place much better than their
potential global competitors. These companies are working closely with our
Government to create a better environment for their investments and
therefore the risk of doing business is greatly reduced. Africans are
finding new ways of doing business that is specific to the continent.

The greatest challenge is, however, to introduce innovations and add value
to the existing technologies suitable for African conditions and relevant
to the people of Africa. There has been big spending on infrastructure by
public corporations such as Telkom, Eskom and the special development
initiatives. This spending has certainly stimulated the economy, provided
services and created jobs. However, we need to merge infrastructure
spending with an investment in education and training.

What we need is an industry-specific human resource plan that co-ordinates
the various in-house initiatives in the sector. Equipment in information
technology systems requires personnel to maintain and operate it. There is
a skills shortage in the country.

Recently in our sector of telecommunications, the Minister of
Communications and her department hosted an important colloquium to test
the views of the industry as we introduce phased and managed competition to
Telkom in our country. The industry at the colloquium supported the setting-
up of a new information and communications institution or university to
train personnel in this fast-growing sector of the industry.
We need to utilise the experience and successful approach of the public-
private partnerships in capital expenditure Government projects on
infrastructure to address this urgent challenge. Government established a
telecommunications-dedicated human resource fund that is currently funding
a number of exciting initiatives.

A finding by the Human Sciences Research Council that investigated the
demand for and supply of high-level human resources in the
telecommunications sector is being implemented. There are, and Adv Gaum
must listen to this, 60 web laboratories based in previously disadvantaged
institutions that offer, for example, A+ and MCSE, and recently also Java
courses. There are also courses that are offered in these institutions that
include networking and engineering programmes.

One of the most encouraging success stories is the Institute for Satellite
Space Application, ISSA, that is based in the Western Cape at Houwteq. Issa
has already trained 202 BSc graduates from historically disadvantaged
backgrounds, and 50% of them are young rural women. Many of them came from
homes without computers or telephones, but are already trained in using
Microsoft, Cisco and Unix networking, satellite engineering, remote sensing
and related fields.

There is also another initiative at the National Electronic Media Institute
for SA, Nemisa, where 40 students are currently receiving high-level skills
in media productions and multimedia services. Every industry player in the
ICT sector has an in-house facility to train personnel. The challenge now
is to bring together these fragmented initiatives under one roof and one
institution.

Perhaps the commission that the President intends setting up should closely
consider this proposal to establish one ICT institution in the country for
high-level skills training. The public and private sectors must invest in
high-level education for a better-equipped and better-skilled workforce.

Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition spoke loosely and carelessly about
the current process of accelerating change in our country. He used words
such as wholesale privatisation, and was advocating the big-bang approach
to the opening-up of the telecommunications and other sectors of our
economy. The DP like posturing as a party of business. They claim that they
represent the interests of capital in South Africa. Well, I am not so sure
about this claim.

About 300 participants from the industry attending the colloquium that I
have mentioned, reached a consensus view that a managed and phased
liberalisation of the telecommunications industry in South Africa is the
route to follow. The DP certainly is not speaking on behalf of anybody, and
this has been proved time and time again. They have no interest in the
country at large.

What they want is to sell the country to foreign companies without any
benefit to the vast majority of South Africans. We need affordable, high-
quality and sophisticated services for all our people. The DP wants a
wholesale selling-off of our country's treasures. We do not. We want a
clear, regulated and predictable process of managed liberalisation. We are
restructuring to meet our national objectives, and the objectives of the
telecommunications sector tally with our goal of addressing universal
savings and access in the country.

The recent double intervention of our President and the presidents of
Tanzania and Nigeria on the platform of global capital, signifies the
confidence of a continent that has come of age, and is able to make a stand
in a globally competitive environment. The dominant forces of peace and
development, which for centuries have been kept within the boundaries of
colonialism, are rising and competing for acceptance.

African countries such as Senegal, Uganda, Mauritius and Cameroon are
projected to be amongst the fastest growing economies in the world. We
would like to thank the hon the President for his attention and dedication
to the information and communications technology industry. For those who
care to follow his work closely, his focus on the ICT and trade is clear
for everybody to see.

Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, Mr Kekana speaks loosely and carelessly if he
says that we simply say: Sell off the family silver. On the contrary, we
say: Give access and interconnection to the family copper in the form of
Telkom, so that the sector really can thrive in our country, and stop
overmanaging with the purported liberalisation. We do not represent
capital. We represent the little people, more and more and more of them,
that is why the ANC represents fewer and fewer and fewer of them!
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

The hon the President's acknowledgement on Friday that we have worked
together for a decade to make of our country what for 33 years it was not,
was a simple statement of fact. However, reconciliation had been thrown so
far into reverse by the annus horribilis, the Year of Race, last year, that
his speech constituted cause for relief.

Dare we, in fact, hope that the transition is back on track, that we will
stop hearing the charge that whites are subliminally racist and that their
``subjective racism'' perpetuates the ``objective racism'' caused by
apartheid privilege, leaving the Government largely unable to deliver, and
with no choice but to empower a black elite? Dare we hope? Not quite!
[Interjections.]

Not quite, considering the hon the President's pat on the back for Carl
Niehaus and his sad little circle who apologise for being so powerful from
a position of discernible racial disempowerment within the Africanising
ANC. Dissenters do indeed advance humanity, as the hon Pallo Jordan says.
The dissenters of the past were us. He, himself, has a proud track record
of dissent within the ANC. He should be praising the hon Andrew Feinstein,
of course, not the pale conformists.

We cannot really hope that last year's hurt and damage will now be allowed
to heal, apparently not quite, considering the President is poised to take
``the necessary steps further to develop a national consensus'' on racism
as the September UN Racism Conference in Durban approaches; and wants us
also to implement the decisions taken at last year's Sandton race jamboree.
We cannot hope at all really, when hon members see how the hon Minister
Tshwete implements this year's ANC birthday decision to mobilise against
colonialism and slavery by attacking Portuguese-speaking South Africans.
[Interjections.]

Last year's 8 January decision gave us the Racism Conference, of course. In
other words, the hon the President invites another year of race-dominated
discourse. Perhaps he intends to give the local ``wit gevaar'' a break this
year, only to transfer the ``total onslaught'' to the foreign powers whose
ghostly ancestors, long dead and buried, ``for 300 years did make our
country what it was''. This would be a case, I suppose, not of subliminal,
but subterranean racism. I doubt if it will do much for foreign direct
investment. It seems blame will remain the name of the game, but the game
is now global. It is called the ``new internationalism''.

Is the President seriously contemplating support for the fantastical idea
of international compensation for slavery and colonialism, notwithstanding
Zimbabwe, while his own Government heartlessly avoids paying reparation to
our own TRC victims, despite our solemn legal undertaking as a nation?
[Interjections.] We seek clarification on this matter, and we remind hon
members that Africa itself practised, participated in and profited from
slavery. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Ms F I CHOHAN-KOTA: Madam Speaker, by viciously attacking Carl Niehaus and
others, I think Dene Smuts exposes a very ugly side of her alliance to this
side of the House.

Yesterday, the Chief Whip of the Majority Party predicted a greater
oversight role for Parliament as we emerged from our legislative phase to
an era of delivery. I have been asked to deal with some of the challenges
that face this institution in the light of its constitutional obligations.
Perhaps we should begin by asking what oversight is and its purpose. Having
heard some of the inputs made here yesterday and today, it is clear that to
some, oversight would involve chastising the executive whenever and however
the occasion arises, with the objective of every now and then securing the
dislodgement of the proverbial ministerial hurt.

This perspective has the drawback of constant standoffs in the style of the
American congress. It has the natural consequence of a lack of progress and
delivery. Clearly, these are the kinds of things America can stand and
withstand, but not a postapartheid South Africa. I want to submit that this
extreme approach is not only archaic, but most unproductive. To those
proponents of it, let me recommend the book by Peter Riddell entitled
Parliament under Pressure, which members will find in the reference section
of the library here.

As I said, this is one extreme approach. At the other extreme, there are
those parliaments which do act as administrative rubber stamps, for
example, the parliament that existed within these precincts during the pre-
1994 period. I am not sure where along the spectrum of these two extremes
we will ultimately locate ourselves as Parliament, because this is a matter
for intense discussion, debate and evolution. I do have some of my own
thoughts on the matter, however, supported by some members of my party who
participated in a workshop on the subject recently. No doubt, there will be
counter views and options. So I can see that the matter is far from being
finalised, but here are some thoughts nonetheless.

The mandate that the ANC received during the 1994 elections was for the
institutional, social and economic transformation of our country. This
mandate would have remained unfulfilled had Parliament exercised a
confrontationist brand of oversight. Clearly, Many of the achievements of
the Government would have remained unfulfilled, and disillusionment and
discontent would have been the order of the day. As it happened, much of
what was achieved during the first parliamentary term was by and large
through a process of constructive engagement by Parliament and the
executive, and vice versa. In a narrow sense these engagements could be
termed checks on the Government, but, in reality, they enriched the
processes of policy and lawmaking by allowing the executive to draw on the
broader pool of thought that prevails in this institution.

In 1999, the electorate said with a loud voice that they wanted more of the
same. One imagines that this would not have been the outcome if the
legislature and the executive had constantly thwarted one another and by
necessary implication hindered delivery of the electoral mandate.
Therefore, our argument is that if the purpose of parliamentary oversight
is to be corrective, ensuring effective delivery of identified priorities
and the optimum usage of public resources, then there is some measurable
purpose to the oversight role of Parliament.

Those of us who are of this view consider that the overall mandate of the
ANC backbench is to ensure an effective and efficient delivery of those
priorities that the ANC itself has identified. Interestingly, of course,
members of the executive, particularly this executive, are not averse to
the notion of an efficient and effective government. It is this shared
common vision that has led, by and large, to a constructive relationship
between the ANC study groups and the executive.

The input by the hon Judy Chalmers yesterday was an exposition on what
oversight means in real terms. It is not oversight for the sake of
oversight or showing up one or other Minister, but oversight aimed at
ensuring that the delivery of national priorities is enhanced where it is
lacking in her constituency,  it is fine-tuned where it needs to be and the
views of the people are given expression. Parliament therefore becomes a
barometer measuring implementation and an early warning system.

Clearly, one of our major challenges lies in this approach. We need
ultimately to give expression to the aspirations of the people we claim to
represent. Portfolio committees will need to more actively undertake
provincial visits that were a more prominent feature of our early days in
Parliament. Parliament will have to ensure that its programme allows for
oversight work to be done by portfolio committees. It would be a good start
if there were some attempt to inject certainty into the programme of
Parliament. The other major challenge will be to ensure the implementation
of the Public Finance Management Act by departments within projected
timeframes.

Finally, before I leave the podium, let me just touch on the following
issue. One of the issues that consistently rears its head is the issue of
resources and capacity for members of Parliament and portfolio committees.
This, indeed, poses a very serious challenge to Parliament. However, there
exists a concomitant duty on the part of members of Parliament. Yesterday a
very prominent member of one of the opposition parties asked: On what basis
can the executive not implement a resolution of Parliament? This was
clearly a reference to the special investigating units. A cursory reading
of the Act which established the special investigating units, which this
very House passed, would have been very revealing to the hon member.

I say this not to score political points but to make the point that if
members of Parliament display a lack of knowledge and operate in a manner
that is frankly unprofessional, then we cannot expect to be taken seriously
by the executive, who have become experts in their fields of operation and
who have the capacity of entire departments at their disposal. This is,
indeed, a challenge to all of us across party lines in this House.
[Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, before I deliberate on this matter, I would
like to put something on record. Twice in this House an allegation has been
made against the ACDP by the Democratic Alliance that we are ANC lackeys.
Today a motion was moved that we are a party of no integrity because we
have struck up an association with the ANC somewhere in the rural areas.
[Interjections.]

These assertions come from the Democratic Alliance, because the ACDP did
not sign an agreement with them. I want to place it on record that the ANC
might be their enemy, but they are not our enemy. [Applause.] It is
becoming increasingly clear to us that the only thing we have in common is
the fact that we are sitting on the same side of the House. [Applause.]

Nonetheless, let me turn to the real issues. There are acts of commission
and there are acts of omission. Whilst it is conventional and acceptable
that the President makes a general address on such occasions, he opens
himself up to criticism when he omits to mention important issues. The arms
deal, which is definitely on the national agenda, has been made so by the
President who decided to handle the issue himself.
As the Minister of Defence said, I would therefore like to have a bite at
this new-found freedom. Indeed, the President's decision to handle the
matter personally only helped to obfuscate the issues rather than to
clarify them. The impression created, albeit unwittingly, by this show of
power is that the President has spoken on the matter and no further
discussion ought to ensue thereafter. This view was entrenched by the
sudden active participation of high officials in the executive and in
Parliament, as well as in committee functions.

The President's televised assertion that there is no prima facie evidence
of wrongdoing, whilst it may be true, unsuccessfully drew the focus away
from the real issue. That issue is what was mentioned by both the
Directorate of Prosecutions and the Public Protector, namely that even if
there is no wrongdoing the allegations need to investigation. I submit that
that is the crux of the matter.

The question therefore is not whether there is prima facie evidence of
wrongdoing but whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a probe into
the allegations. Therefore, the President's remarks that there was no case
pre-empted the findings of the probe and were issued by the wrong person.
The investigating units must tell the people, after they have completed
their probe, whether there is prima facie evidence of wrongdoing.

As part of the Defence committee, we were given an explanation,   some time
last year, by a gentleman from the AACB and by a representative of Armscor,
as to how the process of acquisition takes place. It became clear from that
explanation that this gentleman from the AACB had a ubiquitous influence
throughout the various stages of the acquisition process. And this is the
issue that, in my view, needs to be investigated: Why was he so influential
in the process?

Indeed, Armscor representatives are of the view that they somehow abdicated
their responsibility to drive the process and not to leave it with the DOD.
Their view, which is correct, is that the DOD's function is confined to the
question of capability.

With regard to the issues which were raised by the hon Holomisa, the
impression was indeed by the exclusion of the Heath Unit that the
Government wanted to investigate itself. The hon Mr Jeffrey drew an
artificial distinction between the executive and the investigating units.
The fact of the matter is that the investigation itself is a political
issue at this stage. Therefore we need a unit that is seen to be
nonpartisan.

The Government has introduced an amending Bill that removes the word
``judge'' from the Act. Therefore, I do not see why the unit, without Judge
Heath, should not continue with the investigation. There is a cardinal
principle in law that justice must not only be done but must be seen to be
done.

We welcomed the declaration by the President in the statement of 19 January
2001, when he said:


  I want to deal with these matters openly and honestly. Let us therefore
  repeat that we are fully committed to rooting out corruption in our
  society. The Government fully supports all lawful investigation into the
  matter pertaining to the acquisition, and we will continue to co-operate
  with and assist all those charged with the task.

It remains to be seen whether this promise will be carried through in the
absence of an investigation which is nonpartisan or perceived to be
nonpartisan. [Applause.]

Mr L J MODISENYANE: Madam Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy President, I
am not surprised that Adv Madasa has not learned up to now, because he was
in Luthuli House where he could not learn and he cannot learn in an
institution like this one. That is why he does not listen carefully when
the Minister of Defence speaks. I thought he would turn around and not act
like a robot after it has been programmed to say something.

It is a great honour that I have also been allowed to participate in this
important debate in which I am tasked to reflect on the eradication of
poverty and land reform. Hon members will remember that the high level of
poverty in this country has always been the concern of our government,
otherwise our goal of a better life for all will not be realised. It is
therefore imperative that we continue to combat poverty at all times.

Hon members will definitely agree with me that most of us have experienced
poverty directly. It is not a mere phenomenon or an academic exercise, let
alone mental gymnastics that we engage in when we talk about poverty. When
we talk about poverty, we are talking about real life as experienced by the
majority of South Africans. Most of our people are still living under
conditions of abject poverty. They experience it environmentally, socially
and economically.

We do not have to go more than 5 km out of Cape Town to realise the effects
of poverty, especially in places such as the Nyanga informal settlement and
the surrounding areas of Cape Town. This is a reflection of the poverty in
all provinces. That is why our provinces have developed their own poverty
eradication strategies arising from the integrated rural development and
urban renewal strategies at national level.

I would like to reflect briefly on the Free State province, which is the
second poorest province after the Eastern Cape. The Free State government
tasked the Minister of Social Development to lead the strategy for poverty
eradication, and fruitful results are visible. The goal of the strategy is
to reduce poverty systematically in a period of ten years. I can,
therefore, bravely state that integrated poverty programmes have been
developed and they are being implemented. That is why the people continue
to have confidence in the ANC Government. The hon Andries Botha and his
team are still licking their wounds after their humiliating defeat in the
local government elections in the Free State. [Interjections.]

We commend those NGOs and individuals who are assisting in eradicating
poverty-related problems everywhere in the country. That is exactly what
the Government expects from organs of civil society and individuals, namely
to play their part in uplifting our communities. That is what we call unity
in action.

Hon members must also note that the Government is doing its best to
encourage the bridging of wage gaps. It is the will of our Government to
see sustainable livelihood. It is a known fact that communities which are
economically better off remain very stable. We are looking forward with
confidence to the implementation of the minimum wage, as promised by the
Minister of Labour. There will then be a tremendous reduction in poverty
levels.

Sometimes I wonder what is meant by job losses, especially to domestic
workers and farmworkers who are, in essence, worse off than pensioners.
With their heavy workloads, they remain even more indigent than pensioners.

(Translation of Sesotho paragraphs follows.)

[Let me put emphasis on the restructuring and renewal process in the
country and how it is being implemented. There are laws, good laws, but it
is a pity that they are not being implemented.

People who live on farms are still being called squatters because their
employers see them as such. That is why they are abused and evicted from
the farms, in disregard of the law. If hon members could be alert at all
times, and stop such actions, there would be far fewer problems of that
kind. Bit by bit, people become more aware of the law that ensures the
stability of farm life. It is the co-operation that the President wishes
for that can end such hardships.

Those people who live on farms, who did not send in their applications to
regain possession of the land that was taken from them by force, must
realise that the Government gave them several periods of grace to give them
the time to lodge such applications. If they have not done so by 31 March
2001, they must forget about it, because he who moves last gets the least.
It does not help to build a fort after an attack.

It is gratifying that the land distribution programme is going ahead and
some farmers are also involved in programmes to divide the land, to help
new farmers from the black community. There are lots of plantations
belonging to the people, with the help of the department and
municipalities. All that is needed is hardworking people to make a success
of those plantations.

Black people are also allowed to have their own farms, through their own
efforts and with the help of the department. They must wake up and buy
their own farms, and stop complaining like our comrades on the left.

The good news is that Agri SA has made it clear that it intends to work
with the Government in its process of renewal and restructuring of the
country. We will believe it when it happens.

In conclusion, I say forward with the programme of renewing and
restructuring the lives of the people, especially those who live in Qwaqwa,
where the poverty is extreme. Not forgetting Thaba Nchu and Botshabelo. We
are moving forward! [Applause.]]

Ms N G W BOTHA: Madam Speaker, Comrade President, Deputy President,
comrades and hon members, we are indeed blessed in this country to have a
leader of the President's calibre. His address last Friday was well-
received by the nation. He articulated the vision of the ANC very clearly.
He was able to inspire us and the people of this country into action to get
involved in building a better South Africa.

However, there are those such as the hon Tony Leon and his cronies who
still question his leadership qualities and leadership style. Of course we
are aware of their sinister agenda. They are seeking to discredit him
because he dares to challenge the power and authority of their bosses as
well as that of the G8. They scorn him because he seeks to change the
balance of power in the interest of fundamental transformation in South
Africa and Africa as a whole. They see the African Renaissance as a threat
to their programme of further exploiting the economic resources of the
people of this continent. They still cannot accept the fact that power is
no longer in their hands and that they will never taste power again.
[Interjections.]

Our Comrade President's address was like a breath of fresh air for the
nation, particularly to the great majority of our people who suffered as a
result of the socioeconomic policies of the apartheid government. These are
the people who understand the vision of the ANC. These are the people who
are prepared to help build a better South Africa. I wish to commend the
President for his outstanding leadership both for our country, South
Africa, and for our continent, Africa.

We have heard his call to all South Africans across the colour line to
dedicate this year to building unity in action for change. We, the ANC, are
ready to carry out that mandate given to us by the people of South Africa.
However, my concern is that the DP and the New NP do not appear to have
understood what he meant when he said we should build unity in action for
change, and that all the people of South Africa, black and white, women and
men, should unite in action to speed up transformation. They are trying to
find any lame excuse to slow down the process of change. I can assure the
President that the rest of the people of this country are happy with the
way he outlined the principal elements of our Government's programme of
action. Our task now is to implement.

I also wish to commend him for his honesty and openness, when in his
address he expressed concern about the slow progress being made with regard
to the important issue of achieving gender equality. It is indeed a very
important issue. He went on to say that the Government had failed to
achieve the necessary progress in respect of gender equity in the area of
employment, and he quoted some figures. Yes, this issue is partly about
figures, because women constitute more than 50% of the population of this
country, but this indicator sometimes fall short of capturing the life
experiences of women.

It is also about unequal gender relations, relationships between women and
men in which women have less access to resources, opportunities and
decision-making. It is about improving the quality of life and the status
of women in order to level the playing fields. It is about a better life
for all of us, women and men. The slow progress that the President is
concerned about also concerns me, and is an indication of the systemic
nature of the problem which this Government inherited.

The social and economic inequalities were brought about by the systems of
colonialism and apartheid, which by their very nature, were patriarchal.
This condition has brought pain and suffering to the majority of our people
and, to a great extent, women in particular. The parties who today call
themselves the DP and the New NP supported it and were responsible for
perpetrating the policies of the apartheid system, which tore our families
apart and eroded our human dignity.

Land dispossession, the migrant labour system, anti-urbanisation policies,
the colour bar, pass laws, forced removals, bantu education, you name it,
we can never forget that. These policies affected women and children to a
very great extent, causing them tremendous pain and hardship. This is why
today we have this big challenge as this democratic Government to address
the issues of crime, violence against women, poverty, malnutrition and
other diseases of poverty.

Another setback, of course, is resistance to change on the part of some
individuals in the Public Service who are responsible for the
implementation of Government policies and programmes. In some instances
there appears to be a deliberate attempt by these individuals to undermine
the process of transformation, particularly in the area of gender equity
and equality.

The Freedom Charter states that the rights of people shall be the same,
regardless of race, colour or gender. The ANC has since then been very
consistent in promoting this ideal and has been the lone voice fighting for
gender equity and equality. It is the ANC which ensured that our present
Constitution guarantees that every person enjoys full and equal rights and
freedoms.

It is this Government which introduced legislation which is intended to
promote equality, prevent unfair discrimination and protect human dignity.
It is this Government which developed and implemented policies to address
the systemic gender inequalities which are still so deeply embedded in
social structures and practices. It is this Government that established the
national machinery for advancing gender equality.
The ANC's position on this issue is unwavering. The resolution taken at the
lekgotla states that the ANC must conduct a sustained campaign for gender
equality to raise public awareness of sexism and the empowerment of women
and to encourage an atmosphere of zero-tolerance of sexism. It further
states that the ANC will conduct a concerted campaign against violence
against women and give special priority to the position of the girl child.
The needs of the girl child cannot be overemphasised. We need to ensure
that the girl child is protected from all forms of sexual and psychological
abuse and violence, that she attends school regularly and completes matric
as basic education. Educate a woman and one educates a family.

The ANC, as I demonstrated, has an enlightened understanding and a
progressive approach to ensuring gender equity and equality within our
society. However, this vision is not shared by the DP and the New NP. They
are silent on the issue of gender equality and gender equity.
[Interjections.] This is highlighted by the fact that they have never once
produced a framework which indicates an intention to address these
disparities between women and men, which they created. The obvious reason
is because their constituency has always enjoyed a high status within
society. This is another challenge for us.

The women of this country have also welcomed the announcement by Comrade
President to the effect that the Government will pay attention to the
critical microeconomic issues. This is an area where most of the poor women
are located. This initiative will create an enabling environment for these
women, which will ensure their growth and upward mobility, which may
eventually lead to their entering the macroeconomic mainstream.

Gender mainstreaming is not an easy task. The transition towards equality
is a slow-moving process, steeped in the politics of power and control.
However, no matter what the odds are, change has to take place and must
take place for the betterment of all South Africans, women and men.

As President Museveni of Uganda once said, the involvement of women in the
development process is not just a matter of ethics, but of good economics.
The challenge of development urges us to pay more than just lip service to
the core issue of unequal relations in our society. Our policy aims at
strengthening the position of women in the economy by raising the value and
productivity of their labour and by giving them access to and control over
productive resources. [Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Madam Speaker, President and Deputy President, the
Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development is desperately casting
around for reasons to justify the exclusion of the Health unit from the
investigation into the arms deal. It struck me, listening to him, that
Penuell does protest too much.

Contrary to what the Minister tried to claim in this House today, the
report by Advocates Kahn and Lubber stated that it was imperative that the
special investigating unit be included in the investigation. And the
Minister's version of events has been termed a cynical distortion of the
report by the Sunday Independent newspaper.

The unit has unique powers and functions, which make it ideally suited to
conducting such an investigation. For example, the President and the
Minister of Justice insisted that there was no prima facie case of
corruption in the arms deal. But this is not the point. The unit does not
need a prima facie case before it can move, as the hon Chohan-Kota would
know if she had read the Act.

Its brief, in terms of the law, is to investigate any alleged serious
maladministration, improper conduct, etc, in connection with the affairs of
the state. Its job is to respond to such allegations and to find out if
there is a prima-facie case. It is an incontrovertible fact that such
allegations abound. One just has to read the Auditor-General's report. It
is noteworthy that there is also a provision in the law encouraging a
symbiotic relationship between the unit and the Public Protector,
envisaging that they should work together, as the unit has unique powers to
institute civil proceedings and to recover state assets. [Interjections.]

The so-called fishing expeditions by the unit that the Minister has
referred to and complained about having actually already recovered over R1
billion worth of state assets. [Interjections.] The Minister persists with
quoting selectively from correspondence. We suggest that he make public the
letters that he quoted little bits of and make them available to Scopa
without delay.

I would like to devote the few minutes at my disposal to the issue of
crime. As our leader of the DA said in his speech yesterday, it is one of
the great issues on which this Government is judged. Its failure to deliver
on its repeated promises to improve the situation is a huge disservice to
our country and its international standing. Since June 1999, in his opening
speeches in this House, the President has addressed the issue of the
failing criminal justice system, but only flirtingly and briefly, and in
the vaguest of terms. Surely this should change.

In the spirit of national unity, which is the goal of all of us, and for
the purpose of constructive engagement with Government on all our country's
vital interests, I wish to appeal to the Government and to hon Minister
Erwin, in particular, to accept that the issues that we raise in this House
regarding crime are to get a better deal for our embattled citizens and to
improve our rotten international image on this score, which certainly acts
as a disincentive to investment and to skills immigration into our country,
as he knows very well.

Crime in our country knows no politics and no colour. Last Friday my
sister, a newly elected ANC councillor in Johannesburg, was mugged, robbed
of her cellphone and injured by flying glass from her shattered car
windscreen. Her main functions in politics are in the tourism field, in the
tourism committee. She is meant to sell our country.

For the hon Mr Jeffery's information, the person who stole her cellphone
was black and the person who took her to hospital was black as well. Every
one of us in this House and our families have been affected by serious
violent crime. The public out there does not experience any improvement in
the situation - in fact, their experiences are to the contrary.

Banishing the statistics and hiding the high crime figures will not change
or disguise one very clear fact. Since this Government took power in 1994
serious violent crime has increased steeply and steadily. The trend is very
clearly seen from these now invisible statistics.

During the past six years from 1994 to May 2000, when the statistics
stopped, the 20 most serious crimes had increased by 11,3% over the period.
Violent crimes increased by 20% over the period; theft was up 27%; robbery
was up 133%; burglary was up 20%; assault was up 20%; rape was up 18%; and
only murder and attempted murder were down marginally. The steepest
increase in serious violent crime since 1994 is reflected in the figures
for the first five months of last year up to May when the statistics were
muzzled.

Having placed a moratorium on the release of statistics, it is ridiculous
for Minister Tshwete to come and claim successes in this House in the fight
against crime, as he did yesterday. How can we know if it is true, if we do
not have the full picture. It is also inexplicable why the President has
publicly claimed that crime has decreased based on these very figures, when
even the most cursory reading makes it clear that only murder is down. It
raises the question as to how his staff and speech writers can feed him
such inaccurate information. [Time expired.]

Mr P R MOKABA: Madam Speaker, President, Deputy President, let me preface
my speech, because it has been a very long time since I have been at this
podium. Last year this time I fell ill, so I have been away for more than a
year and I would like to thank all of you for having wished me well. I am
in good health. I would particularly like to thank the President, who
intervened directly and refused to let me pass away. [Applause.] I know
that the President is embarrassed by what I have just said.

Comrade President has placed an issue before us. He said that the people of
our country would like to know what it is that they should do to ensure a
better life for all. This is a question that we should have answered, and
one that the opposition dismally failed to answer. The PAC simply said that
it is too academic. [Laughter.] But it has to be answered.

The President has also asked us to explain to him again, whether our
revolution has two tasks. The one is to establish and manage democracy, the
other is to build our economy and ensure that poverty is eliminated for all
of us.

When in his earlier speeches the President borrowed Benjamin Disraeli's
notion of two nations - one rich, one poor - he was highlighting a painful
reality and not prescribing a desirable ideal. His ideal, which is also the
ideal the ANC embraced at its birth, is to forge one united, democratic,
nonracial, nonsexist and prosperous South African nation from the diverse
elements that make up our people. It does not, however, assist the project
of nation-building to deny the reality that the granite walls of apartheid
have, indeed, cloven the people of this country into two separate, highly
unequal blocks.

The ideal of a united South Africa can only be realised by these two blocks
working jointly together to eliminate poverty and create prosperity for
all. They should work together for economic growth, socioeconomic
development, political and social stability for an environmentally-
sustainable development. By sustainable development we mean putting the
means of livelihood before the people in general and the poor in
particular.

That is the reason the President also promotes a thesis of a people at work
for a better life. He has pointed in the right direction by saying that,
indeed, these two nations can become one nation, and that is our objective.
The opposition should therefore not be allowed to impose their own
deviationist interpretations and thereby corrupt the actual intentions of
the President so that they can in future claim that the President is
inconsistent.

The question that the President poses to us as a nation and Parliament is:
Six years since the advent of democracy, how far are we from the goal of a
country and a continent where no child should ever again walk in fear of
guns, tyrants and abuse; where no African child should ever again
experience hunger, avoidable diseases and ignorance; where no child should
ever again feel ashamed to be African? How far are we?

Central to this particular problem in South Africa is the problem of
racism. By racism we mean that system of allocation of public and private
goods and services and the means of production in a manner that makes the
boundaries of access, inclusion, wealth and deprivation, poverty and
hunger, coincide with the boundaries of race.

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: What about ``kill the boer''?

Mr P R MOKABA: It is rooted in the property rights ... [Interjections.] ...
in the patterns of ownership and income distribution which finally impact
on attitudes and ideas, and not in songs as the hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk
thinks. [Interjections.] It is a system that Marthinus van Schalkwyk, the
hon Tony Leon, the hon Ken Andrew and their white predecessors imposed on
and maintained in South Africa in the form of white supremacy and now
masquerading as liberal democracy, which remains their ideology to this
day, as Mr Tony Leon said yesterday. [Interjections.]

As is now recorded in history, it specialised in allocating hunger, poverty
and deprivation to the black people of our country while allocating wealth,
access and life to the whites, in the same way that German nazism, Japanese
militarism, Italian fascism did in the 1930s and 1940s against the Jews.
[Interjections.] It is a system that must be uprooted and smashed because
it cannot be reformed, and the President has pointed the way forward in
this regard. [Interjections.]

In order to do so, one can never achieve this unless one has plans, and
only the ANC has such plans. [Interjections.] [Applause.] The rest are
satisfied with only being armchair critics of the ANC's plans, while others
are simply unpatriotic and counterrevolutionary. [Interjections.] We are a
movement of plans and implementation of action, and not promises. It is
therefore sheer nonsense that the ANC and the Government would seek to hide
anything from the people of South Africa or feed them half-truths when we
are the ones who believe that our revolution is the festival of our people.

We maintain that no movement or organisation is as honest with the people
as the ANC. [Applause.] The ANC's management of the economy and democracy
and its leadership of society are beyond question, except by the charlatans
of both the left and the right, who have neither plans of their own nor
support for their wayward dreams.

In their comments the opposition have, true to their colours, concentrated
on singling out the negative and avoiding the positive, in keeping with
their bad-mouthing of our country abroad. [Interjections.] The basic truth
is, however, that no other organisation inside or outside Government or
Parliament and in the entire history of South Africa has delivered as much
in such a short space of time and with so few resources as the ANC has and
continues to do. [Applause.]

Under the leadership of the ANC, its former president Nelson Mandela and
now Comrade President Thabo Mbeki, South Africa has made good progress in
the areas of monetary policy, trade, the budget deficit, the easing of the
balance of payments constraints, debt servicing, inflation,
reprioritisation of the Budget, restructuring of state assets, reforming
the tax system and improving on tax collection, thereby succeeding in
securing a long-term growth trend in excess of population growth, securing
access to new markets, integrating the Public Service and transforming
public sector institutions, and establishing a policy framework for the
delivery of social services. [Interjections.]

In this context the Government has delivered beyond expectations, and it is
for this reason that I must say it was a shame to hear what we have heard
from Marthinus and from Tony Leon. I am not worried about Marthinus,
because he is a man who today lives in the belly of the beast.
[Interjections.] There he behaves like a butterfly in Tony Leon's stomach.
[Laughter.] [Applause.] The tragedy of our country is, one day Tony Leon
will take a purgative, and we will have a problem in respect of waste
management, trying to deal with the result of that purgative. [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

Debate suspended.
