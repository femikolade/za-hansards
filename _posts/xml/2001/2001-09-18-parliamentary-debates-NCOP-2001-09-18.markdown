                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die  volgende
sitting sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die jongste verslag van  die  Mediese  Navorsingsraad
       met die titel ``Die impak van MIV/Vigs op sterftes by volwassenes  in
       Suid-Afrika'', wat alle twyfel wat daar nog is oor  die  bestaan  van
       MIV/Vigs en die verwoestende uitwerking wat dit op  Suid-Afrika  het,
       finaal die nek inslaan;


  (2) verder met skok kennis neem dat die verslag onder andere bevestig dat
       Vigs verlede jaar verantwoordelik was vir 40% van al die sterftes  by
       mense tussen die ouderdomme 15 en 49, wat beteken dat tot  6  miljoen
       Suid-Afrikaners teen die jaar 2020 aan Vigs sal sterf;


  (3) sy kommer uitspreek dat die verslag verder meld  dat  teen  die  jaar
       2020   kindersterftes   sal   verdriedubbel    tensy    doeltreffende
       voorsorgmaatreëls ingestel word om te verhoed  dat  MIV/Vigs-verwante
       siektes sodanig sal  toeneem  dat  dit  dubbel  dié  van  alle  ander
       sterftes saam sal wees: en


  (4) 'n ernstige beroep op die  President  doen  om  hom  te  weerhou  van
       onverantwoordelike uitlatings, gebaseer op verouderde statistiek, wat
       die stryd teen MIV/Vigs geweldige  skade  aandoen,  en  dat  politici
       liefs maatskaplike en gesondheidswerkers  se  stryd  teen  Vigs  moet
       steun eerder as om dit te ondermyn.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting  I
shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the latest report of  the  Medical  Research  Council  entitled
       ``The impact  of  HIV/Aids  on  mortality  amongst  adults  in  South
       Africa'', which finally quashes all  doubts  that  remain  about  the
       existence of HIV/Aids and the devastating  effect  it  has  on  South
       Africa;


  (2) further notes with shock that the  report  reaffirms,  amongst  other
       things, that Aids was responsible for 40% of  all  deaths  last  year
       amongst people between the ages of 15 and 49, which means that up  to
       6 million South Africans will die of Aids by the year 2020;


  (3) voices its concern  that  by  the  year  2020  child  mortality  will
       increase  threefold  unless   effective   preventive   measures   are
       instituted to prevent HIV/Aids-related illnesses from  increasing  to
       the extent that  they  will  be  double  that  of  all  other  deaths
       combined; and


  (4) earnestly appeals to the  President  to  refrain  from  irresponsible
       declarations, based on obsolete statistics, that cause untold harm to
       the fight against HIV/Aids, and to politicians to support social  and
       health workers' fight against Aids, rather than to undermine it.]

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad, in die lig van die voortdurende armoede van 'n  baie  groot
  deel van die bevolking, die toenemende misdaad in stede en  die  behoefte
  aan behuising, meen dat -


  (1) die uitgawe van  R12,6  miljoen  aan  presidensiële  geriewe  by  die
       Kaapstadse Internasionale Lughawe opgeskort moet word; en


  (2)  hoewel  die  veiligheid  van  die  President   belangrik   is,   dit
       bekostigbaar en kreatief gehanteer moet word in die lig van  die  R36
       miljoen wat reeds aan sy huis vir beveiliging  bestee  is  asook  die
       R700 miljoen vir die aankoop van 'n vliegtuig, aangesien dit blyk dat
       genoemde faktore nie in ag geneem word nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting
of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council, in the light of the continuing poverty of a very  large
  section of the population, the increasing crime in cities  and  the  need
  for housing, believes that -


  (1) the expenditure of R12,6 million for presidential facilities at  Cape
       Town International Airport should be suspended; and


  (2) although the safety of the President is important, it should be dealt
       with in an affordable and creative manner in view of the R36  million
       which has already been spent on security measures at  his  residence,
       as well as the R700 million for purchasing  an  aircraft,  since  the
       factors concerned are evidently not being taken into account.]

                                ROSH HASHANA

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council wishes members of  the  Jewish  Community  a  happy  and
  peaceful Rosh Hashana and well over the fast.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       PRISON FELLOWSHIP INTERNATIONAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Prison Fellowship International, an association  of  independent
           national Christian organisations involved  in  criminal  justice
           ministry worldwide, and  having  consultative  status  with  the
           United Nations Economic and Social Council, is currently holding
           its annual international council meeting in Krugersdorp; and


       (b)   since  1976  Prison  Fellowship  International  has  grown   to
           encompass national Prison Fellowship ministries in 88  countries
           with around 100 000 volunteers worldwide,  making  it  the  most
           extensive network  of  Christian  criminal  justice  and  prison
           ministries in the world;


  (2) commends the organisation for its positive contributions worldwide to
       criminal justice and prison reform, particularly its emphasis on  the
       promotion of restorative justice, as well as its work in South Africa
       where it  has  taken  a  leading  role  in  mobilising  and  training
       community volunteers and implementing victim-offender  reconciliation
       projects; and


  (3) prays for the Lord's blessings  upon  its  deliberations  during  its
       international council meeting which will  be  attended  by  delegates
       representing 95 countries.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          TERRORIST ATTACKS ON USA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) sy diepe medelye uitspreek teenoor al die mense wat geliefdes verloor
       het in die barbaarse gruwel- terroriste  aanvalle  in  die  Verenigde
       State van Amerika op die Internasionale Dag  van  Vrede,  Dinsdag  11
       September 2001;
  (2) president Mbeki bedank vir sy onmiddellike en onomwonde  veroordeling
       van hierdie barbaarse massamoord op onskuldige mense en sy oproep  op
       die internasionale gemeenskap om te verenig teen wêreldterrorisme; en


  (3) die President verseker van sy  volle  steun  in  hierdie  verband  en
       volmondig met hom saamstem dat  "those  responsible  for  these  mass
       murders cannot be accepted  as  genuine  representatives  of  a  just
       cause".
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council-


  (1) expresses its deepest sympathy with all  of  those  people  who  lost
       their loved ones in the barbaric and horrific  terrorist  attacks  in
       the United States of America  on  the  International  Day  of  Peace,
       Tuesday 11 September 2001;


  (2) thanks President Mbeki for his immediate and unequivocal condemnation
       of this barbaric mass murder of innocent people and his appeal to the
       international community to unite against world terrorism; and


  (3) assures the President of its full support in this regard and  totally
       agrees with him that  ``those  responsible  for  these  mass  murders
       cannot be accepted as genuine representatives of a just cause''.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

         POLITICAL INTERVENTION IN APPOINTMENT OF MUNICIPAL MANAGERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Me C S BOTHA: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem van -


  (1) die ingreep deur  die  ANC-partyleierskap  in  die  Vrystaat  in  die
       aanstelling van munisipale bestuurders;


  (2)  die  gevolglike  ondergrawing  van  burgemeesters   sowel   as   die
       personeelproses en die persone  wat  in  hierdie  posisies  aangestel
       word;


  (3) die nadelige gevolge wat hierdie politieke afdreiging kan  inhou  vir
       die kapasiteit van plaaslike regering; en


  (4)   die   onvermydelike   aftakeling   van   die   reeds    onvoldoende
       diensleweringsproses.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Ms C S BOTHA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council notes -


  (1) the intervention by the ANC party leadership in the Free State in the
       appointment of municipal managers;


  (2) the consequential undermining of mayors, as  well  as  the  personnel
       process and the persons appointed in these positions;


  (3) the detrimental consequences that this political blackmail  can  have
       for the capacity of local government; and


  (4) the unavoidable  deterioration  of  the  already  inadequate  service
       delivery process.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to the motion? There  is
an objection. The motion will therefore become notice of a motion.

                     DEVASTATING STORMS IN TEMBISA AREA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Voorsitter, ek stel graag sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad  sy  meelewing  betoon  met  die  inwoners  van  Tembisa  en
  aanliggende woongebiede aan die Oos-Rand wat groot skade aan behuising en
  persoonlike besittings gely het tydens die verwoestende  hael-,  reën  en
  windstorm wat dié gebied laat verlede Donderdag getref het.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)
[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson I move without notice:


  That the Council expresses its sympathy with the inhabitants  of  Tembisa
  and the adjoining areas on the East Rand who suffered enormous damage  to
  housing and personal belongings during the  devastating  hail,  rain  and
  windstorm which struck the area late last Thursday.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

             PARTICIPATION OF NCOP CHAIRPERSON IN CPA CONFERENCE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M E SURTY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the competent and very capable manner in which the  Chairperson
       of the NCOP, Ms Naledi Pandor, led the South  African  delegation  to
       Australia for the 47th CPA Conference;


  (2) further notes the significant and substantive  contribution  made  by
       the Chairperson, Ms Pandor,  in  the  paper  on  the  eradication  of
       poverty; and


  (3) commends the Chairperson for her leadership in this regard.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Order!  Is  there  any  objection?  I  object!
[Laughter.] Thank you very much to Mr Surty. The motion is therefore  agreed
to. Thank you, hon members.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          DEATH OF DR CHRIS BARNARD

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die mense van Suid-Afrika  onlangs  met  gebroke  harte  afskeid
           geneem het van een van die grootste seuns  wat  Suid-Afrika  nog
           opgelewer het;


       (b)  dr Chris Barnard, wat op 78-jarige leeftyd op 2  September  2001
           gesterf het, in baie opsigte 'n heel besondere mens was;


       (c)  hy 'n mens was met 'n oop hart en 'n vaardige hand vir mense met
           ernstige hartaandoenings;


       (d)  hy 'n sjarmante persoon was wat seker gemaak het dat die tyd wat
           hy gelewe het, die moeite werd was;


       (e)  hy 'n hele paar vrouens in sy lewe se harte  gebreek  het,  maar
           dat hy baie meer pasiënte se stukkende harte  heel  gemaak  het,
           sonder aansien des persoons en met 'n groot sukses;


  (2) in herinnering roep dat hy op 3 Desember 1967 die wêreld  verras  het
       toe hy die byna onmoontlike reggekry het deur die  eerste  dokter  te
       word wat daarin kon slaag om 'n menslike hartoorplanting suksesvol te
       doen - 'n prestasie wat vir Suid-Afrika wêreldroem besorg het;


  (3) van mening is dat hy -


       (a)  dus 'n ware pionier en 'n held in die oë van die wêreld was;


       (b)  met sy opregtheid en blatante eerlikheid daarin geslaag  het  om
           die media met uitnemendheid te hanteer; en


       (c)  sekerlik een van die beste ambassadeurs was wat Suid-Afrika  nog
           gehad het; en


  (4) sy nagedagtenis eer en die opregte meegevoel van  die  lede  van  die
       Raad aan sy familie oordra.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that-
       (a)  the people of South  Africa  recently  took  leave  with  broken
           hearts of one  of  the  greatest  sons  South  Africa  has  ever
           produced;


       (b)  Dr Chris Bernard, who passed away on 2 September 2001 at the age
           of 78, was quite an exceptional person in many respects;


       (c)  he was a person with an open heart and a deft  hand  for  people
           with serious heart conditions;


       (d)  he was a charming person who made sure that he spent his life in
           a worthwhile manner; and


       (e)  he broke the hearts of quite a number of women in his life,  but
           that he healed the broken hearts of many more patients,  without
           fear or favour and with great success;


  (2) Remembers that on 3 December 1967 he  surprised  the  world  when  he
       achieved the virtually impossible by becoming  the  first  doctor  to
       succeed in successfully transplanting a human heart - an  achievement
       which made South Africa world famous;
  (3) is of the view that he -


       (a)  was therefore a true pioneer and a  hero  in  the  eyes  of  the
           world;


       (b)  succeeded in handling the media excellently with  his  sincerity
           and blatant honesty; and


       (c)  was certainly one of the best ambassadors that South Africa  has
           every had; and


  (4) honours his memory and conveys the sincere condolences of the members
       of the Council to his family.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

             LOSSES TO FARMING COMMUNITY DUE TO EXTREME WEATHER

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:
  Dat die Raad -


  (1) sy meegevoel en simpatie uitspreek  teenoor  die  landbougemeenskappe
       wat groot verliese aan oeste en vrektes van vee, wat geraam  word  op
       R20 miljoen, in die Vrystaat- en KwaZulu-Natal-gebied gely  het  deur
       ongekende koue en sneeu. Sekere van hierdie  gebiede  is  ook  vroeër
       beskadig deur hewige veldbrande; en


  (2) die Minister vir Landbou en Grondsake vra om met simpatie  en  begrip
       die versoek om verligting uit die rampgeteisterde gebied to oorweeg.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E Van NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) Expresses its  sympathy  and  condolences  towards  the  agricultural
       community which suffered large losses  in  crops  and  the  death  of
       livestock, estimated at R20 million, in the Free State  and  KwaZulu-
       Natal area as a result of unprecedented cold and snow. Some of  these
       areas were also previously damaged by serious veld fires; and


  (2) requests the Minister for Agriculture and Land  Affairs  to  consider
       the request for relief from the disaster-torn area with sympathy  and
       understanding.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I note, Mr  Van  Niekerk,  that  a  motion  was
moved earlier with respect to the devastating storms. We  need  to  look  at
the substance of both motions in order to  see  whether  they  are  not,  in
fact, the same in content. The route we propose is that we combine  the  two
so that we do not have any breach of  our  Rules.  We  will  study  the  two
motions and advise the Council at our next sitting.

We will proceed, however, to consider this motion. Is  there  any  objection
to the motion? There is none. The motion is therefore agreed to  subject  to
the guidelines that I have just said we will follow in terms of procedure.

                          MURDERS OF TAXI OPERATORS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with great concern and  sympathy  the  killing  of  seven  taxi
       operators who were ambushed on  their  way  from  the  National  Taxi
       Conference on Sunday, 16 September 2001;


  (2) further notes that this was a criminal activity which undermined  the
       great achievement made during the National Taxi Conference;


  (3) requests the Minister of Safety  and  Security  to  deploy  Operation
       Wheel to the Eastern Cape to deal with these senseless killers; and


  (4) expresses its condolences to the South African National Taxi Council,
       SANTCO.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          TAXI INDUSTRY CONFERENCE
                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the taxi industry for having held  its  first  historic
       conference in Durban over the weekend;


  (2) also notes the Government's commitment and  involvement  in  changing
       the industry from a history  of  intolerance,  into  accountable  and
       professional hands that serve the nation in a safe and reliable  mode
       of transport;


  (3) believes that the positive  resolutions  reached  at  the  conference
       should not be undermined by callous and cowardly acts of terror; and


  (4) congratulates Mr Khorombie Muofhe for being elected as  President  of
       the South African National Taxi Council.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                          (The late Mr G A M Mbeki)

The CHIEF WHIP  OF  THE  COUNCIL:  Chairperson,  I  have  had  the  singular
privilege of serving in the former Senate and  subsequently  the  NCOP  with
Oom Gov Mbeki for a period of five years of his working  life.  I  recollect
the presence of Oom Gov in this Chamber. He was a  man  of  great  political
stature  whose  quiet  presence  was  somewhat  intimidating  to  us   young
politicians.

At his memorial service more than a week ago I quoted from someone  who  had
said that this world does not so much need men of great intellect  -  and  I
use that in a gender-neutral sense - as it needs men of noble  character  in
whom ability is controlled by steadfast principles. I did so on  account  of
the fact that in Oom Gov  Mbeki  we  had  a  man  of  enormous  intellectual
capacity and a person who rigorously adhered to principles.

Oom Gov - and I think this is the purpose of us  remembering  him  today  in
passing our condolences to the family - was a person  who  was  disciplined,
notwithstanding his advanced years. He was  a  person  who  was  focused  on
nation-building and nonracialism. It is interesting that  in  his  ``Anatomy
of  a  Political  Struggle'',  where  he  magnanimously  reflects   on   the
contribution of all racial groups, he ends the article - and this  is  while
he was incarcerated on Robben Island - with the fact that  we  should  focus
our gaze on Parliament, where African, coloured, Indian and white could  sit
together, side by side, and share in the destiny of this country.

We are fortunate that he indeed had the  opportunity  to  be  part  of  this
first democratic Parliament, to serve in a very, very  significant  capacity
as Deputy President of the Senate, and in the manner  in  which  he  served,
reflected a political will to ensure that we did not allow our past  or  our
political  differences  to  prevent  nation-building  and  a   respect   for
diversity.

Oom Gov was an inspiration to many of us, particularly  the  younger  people
who participated in the Council and in the Senate in the  earlier  days.  He
allowed us space to develop.  He  encouraged  robust  political  debate  and
believed that it was important for us to be able to persuade  our  opponents
through rational discourse, rather than coercing or  imposing  our  will  on
people. There are many people who are going to follow on the statement  that
I have just made.

In conclusion, just last week the Minister of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry
deemed it appropriate - and we certainly feel it was most appropriate  -  to
plant a tree in the immediate vicinity of this House. In doing so,  we  will
in the future  be  continuously  alerted  to  his  presence,  to  his  great
contribution to the democracy of this country.

With your permission, Chairperson,  may  I  then  sit  down  and  propose  a
resolution at the conclusion of this debate.

Ms P  C  P  MAJODINA:  Chairperson,  without  clear-sighted  ideologies  and
leaders like Oom Gov, the ANC would not have  changed  this  country.  Govan
Mbeki was a revolutionary in every sense. At the centre of his being was  an
unwavering commitment to the emancipation of all  oppressed  and  struggling
people. For this the nation owes the Mbeki family a debt  of  gratitude.  To
his wife and his children, who together have carried the burden  of  a  life
of service, the people of South Africa are saying a profound thank you.

He was an organiser, an intellectual and a political educator. We mourn  the
loss of a great South African, comforted in the  knowledge  that  what  made
Govan Mbeki great lies in the struggle in which he was forged and  to  which
he dedicated his life.

Mr T S SETONA: Chairperson, on behalf of the Free State province I  want  to
take this opportunity to  express  our  deepest  sympathy  with  the  entire
family of Comrade Govan Mbeki. We also salute the Mbeki  family  for  giving
us a leader whose contribution to our liberation struggle has  ensured  that
we  can  now  walk  tall,  without  fear  in  our  hearts,  assured  of  our
inalienable right to human dignity in a nation at peace with itself and  the
world.

Comrade Govan Mbeki's entire life was one of selfless service to the  people
of our country. Oom Gov was a revolutionary in every sense.  At  the  centre
of his being was an impenetrable commitment to the  liberation  of  all  the
oppressed and exploited people. This commitment  demanded  of  him  and  his
family great sacrifices, including years of state harassment and  a  quarter
of a century spent in prison. It is therefore a fitting tribute to a man  of
his greatness that we have come  together  here  today  to  salute  him  and
praise the contribution he has made, not  only  to  the  liberation  of  the
African majority, but also to the liberation of the oppressors.

Ms  L  JACOBUS:  Chairperson,  Gauteng  province  wishes  to   express   its
condolences with the Mbeki family on the passing of a true  son  of  Africa.
Comrade Govan Mbeki, for those of us who spoke to him in these corridors  of
power, will be fondly remembered  as  an  ordinary  humble  man  who  always
treated all of us as if we were  good  friends,  rather  than  mere  passing
acquaintances. I did not have the privilege of working with Oom Gov  in  the
Senate, but I had the privilege of a few encounters with  him  in  the  ANC,
and therefore I can testify to this fact.

By his quiet dignity  and  firm  grasp  of  the  enormity  of  the  task  of
transforming this country, he kept all of us focused on what  was  important
in fulfilling our dreams of a nonsexist, nonracial democracy. We  know  that
he enjoyed the sometimes robust debate that threatened to  bring  this  roof
down. His wisdom and expertise he readily shared and his unselfishness  will
remain with us forever, especially when we remember how much pride  he  took
in each new lesson learnt towards effective governance. We will miss him  as
the ANC and indeed as a country.

I want to conclude with a  message  to  Oom  Gov  in  which  we  promise  to
continue to build on the foundation he laid for us with the  same  zest  and
zeal  he  always  displayed.  We  will  continue  the   struggle   for   the
transformation of South Africa into the democracy that  he  fought  for  and
devoted his life to. Hamba kahle. [Go well.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, it was with  a  deep  sense  of  sadness  and
shared loss that the province learnt of the passing on  of  Govan  Mbeki,  a
lifelong warrior against racism, oppression  and  exploitation.  His  memory
should make us redouble our efforts to achieve a breakthrough in ensuring  a
life of dignity, free of bigotry and  intolerance,  for  people  around  the
world. Through his years in the history of our own struggle in our  country,
his name takes pride of place as he was the father who built  and  sustained
the tradition of excellent political journalism, a distinguished scholar,  a
disciplined cadre and a teacher.

Govan Mbeki will go down in the annals  of  history  as  a  man  of  immense
integrity.  Through  these  years  Comrade  Mbeki  displayed  a   tremendous
capacity for reading, research and writing. He was effective  in  convincing
others, not only by his charisma and smooth delivery of speeches,  but  also
through his simple logical style and  the  deep,  informed  content  of  his
message. His skills in using his intellectual capabilities and the power  of
the written word will forever remain a powerful antidote to  the  legacy  of
Bantu education, which sought to deprive black South Africans of knowledge.

Even in the early days of his political involvement, Oom Gov  was  respected
as a man of  the  people.  His  political  activities  were  accompanied  by
practical efforts to assist small peasants, encouraging them to form  simple
co-operatives ... [Time expired.]

Mrs  E  N  LUBIDLA:  Madam  Chairperson,  history  is  indeed  made  up   of
significant events which  shape  our  future  and  outstanding  leaders  who
influence our destiny.

Comrade Govan Mbeki's  contribution  to  our  history  places  him  in  this
inimitable position. Oom Gov, as he was affectionately known to most of  us,
was instrumental in helping us realise the unspeakable  suffering  that  was
imposed upon us by the apartheid system.  He  also  played  a  key  role  in
helping  us  rectify  this  situation  through   his   leadership   in   our
revolutionary  alliance,  and  rare  qualities  of  selflessness  and  utter
devotion to equality and justice.

His ability to understand the ideological foundation of  apartheid  and  the
mechanisms through which the  apartheid  ideologues  tried  to  control  our
people helped galvanise  domestic  and  international  support  against  the
racist oppressors.

Comrade Govan Mbeki spent more than 70 years of his productive life  serving
the people of our country. He loved his country and people so much  that  he
was prepared to forsake his friends and family to pursue  the  revolutionary
objective of liberating our people from the yoke of apartheid.

It is therefore with great humility that the Government and  people  of  the
Northern Cape join in his commemoration to convey the deep sense of loss  we
feel as a province, nation and continent at the  loss  of  one  of  Africa's
giants.

[Mr S L E FENYANE: Mr Chairperson, hon members of this  august  House,  this
is a time of sorrow.

I  would  like,  on  behalf  of  the  Northern  Province,  to  express   our
condolences to the family of Govan ``Oom Gov''  Mbeki,  to  President  Thabo
Mbeki and to the ANC. When a big tree has fallen, it is understandable  that
the birds will weep bitterly because they realise  that  they  have  lost  a
source of shelter and protection.

Govan Mbeki was not a tower of strength for his family  only,  but  for  all
South Africans. We are where  we  are  because  of  his  sacrifice  and  his
efforts. He was a soldier among soldiers, a hero among heroes.  Furthermore,
he was a kind-hearted person and his love amazed even his opponents.

Today, we are very proud of his struggle against  the  oppression  of  black
people  in  the  land  of  their  birth,   against   poverty,   hatred   and
discrimination.

May his soul rest in peace for he has made his contribution. We will  always
remember him.]

Rev P MOATSHE: Hon Chairperson, the North West and  its  entire  people  are
saying  that  the  death  of  Oom  Govan  occasioned  the  sad  loss  of  an
intellectual giant who radiated an unfailing commitment and devotion to  the
struggle for freedom.

We regard Oom Govan as a known  thinker,  a  true  compatriot  and  a  pure-
blooded  democrat.  He  was  a  great  statesman  who  harboured  the  noble
qualities of dedication, sacrifice and  discipline.  In  his  honour  former
President Nelson Mandela said:


  Throughout the years he continued to inspire all of us inside and outside
  prison with a certainty that we would triumph in the end.

South Africa mourns the passing away of  one  of  Africa's  great  sons.  We
salute  a  comrade,  a  friend,  a  leader  in  the  struggle,  one  of  the
intellectuals of our movement and a fellow member  of  our  generation  that
has given so much to the shaping of our country.
Oom Govan's death is a national  loss.  We  are  all  indebted  to  him  for
leading us in a way that is most worthy of emulation.  His  life  and  times
were a celebration of  a  life  lived  to  the  fullest.  Oom  Gov  will  be
remembered as a leader who showed immense empathy for  human  suffering  and
compassion for the poor and the oppressed.

His message was always based on conviction, while he  was  indeed  a  superb
academic and intellectual. He spoke from the heart and his  greatest  weapon
was his honesty. His powers of persuasion  and  his  untiring  determination
for the liberation of South Africa placed him  as  a  man  amongst  men.  He
stood out for vision, honesty and sincerity of purpose. [Time expired.]

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, dit is vir my ook 'n voorreg om namens die Wes-
Kaap hulde te bring  aan  'n  eertydse  kollega,  Govan  Mbeki.  Baie  Suid-
Afrikaners het  'n  leeftyd  opgeoffer  vir  wat  hulle  geglo  het  reg  en
regverdig was; sommige selfs met hul lewens. Die geskiedenis in ons land  is
deurtrek daarvan en daarom is ons land ryk  aan  persoonlikhede,  leiers  en
staatshoofde wat elkeen in hul tydvak 'n besondere  bydrae  gelewer  het  om
Suid-Afrika 'n beter land vir al sy mense te maak.
Govan Mbeki het nie verniet gestry vir wat  hy  geglo  het  'n  beter  Suid-
Afrika sal wees nie. Om vir bykans 'n leeftyd in 'n  tronk  te  sit  en  die
vrugte van sy stryd te pluk, is beslis nie vir almal beskore nie. Ek is  dus
oortuig dat Govan Mbeki met 'n danklied  in  sy  hart  oorlede  is.  Ek  was
bevoorreg om met oom Gov, soos ons almal hom  geken  het,  in  die  eertydse
Senaat en later in die NRP saam te werk.

Ek  onthou  hoe  Senator  Bloem  en  Senator  Direko  hom   met   trots   as
visepresident van die Senaat voorgestel het. Dit was  in  die  begindae  van
ons nuwe vryheid in 1994. Baie van ons het gewonder  of  die  nuwe  bedeling
sou werk, maar met die deursettingsvermoë en begrip  en  leiding  van  veral
Senator Coetzee en Senator Mbeki  as  president  en  visepresident  van  die
Senaat het hierdie huis gou 'n sieraad blyk te wees in ons nuwe Parlement.

Govan Mbeki was intelligent en 'n innemende mens. Hy was  skaam  en  nederig
as iemand met hom gesels het, maar tog was hy 'n rots van  Gibraltar  waarop
kollegas kon vertrou. Hy het altyd aandagtig  na  debattering  geluister  en
nooit tussenwerpsels gemaak nie, maar aan sy lyftaal kon mens sien  as  iets
hom nie aangestaan het nie. 'n Platjie en 'n  humoristiese  persoon  was  hy
beslis. Reeds met sy eerste verskyning in die Stoel het hy  dit  gewys.  Die
volgende aanhaling uit Hansard, 26 Mei 1994 gee so 'n klein blikkie  op  dié
sy van hom (Hansard 1994, col 90):


  The DEPUTY PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE: Order! Mr President of the  Republic,
  I did not see you come into the Senate. How you managed to slip in  I  do
  not know! I should like to assure you that you are most welcome here ...


  If  you  had  been  present  when  we  started  yesterday,  and  if   the
  congratulations that were expressed could have been  carried  in  dishes,
  you would not have been able to leave this House bearing all  the  dishes
  containing the congratulations!

Dit was tipies van Govan Mbeki. Dit was 'n eer om hom te  ken  en  saam  met
hom ons wonderlike land te dien. Mag sy familie  vertroosting  vind  in  die
vrugte van sy arbeid. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, on behalf of the Western Cape, it  is  also  a
privilege for me to pay tribute to a former  colleague,  Govan  Mbeki.  Many
South Africans sacrificed a lifetime for what they believed  was  right  and
justified; some of them even lost their lives. The history  of  our  country
is imbued with that and therefore our country is  rich  with  personalities,
leaders and statesmen who all made  an  exceptional  contribution  in  their
time to make South Africa a better country for all its people.

Govan Mbeki did not struggle in vain for what he believed would be a  better
South Africa. To have been in prison for nearly a lifetime and then to  reap
the fruits of his struggle is,  certainly,  not  everyone's  destiny.  I  am
therefore convinced that Govan Mbeki died with a  song  of  thanksgiving  in
his heart. I was privileged to work with oom Gov, as we  all  knew  him,  in
the former Senate and later in the NCOP.

I remember how Senator Bloem and Senator Direko introduced  him,  with  much
pride, as deputy president of the Senate. That was in the early days of  our
new freedom in 1994. Many of  us  wondered  whether  this  new  dispensation
would  work,  but  with  the  perseverance,  understanding  and   leadership
particularly of Senator Coetzee and Senator Mbeki, as president  and  deputy
president of the Senate, this House quickly  became  a  credit  to  our  new
Parliament.

Govan Mbeki was an intelligent and charming person. He was  shy  and  modest
when anybody talked to him, but at the same time he was a rock of  Gibraltar
on whom colleagues  could  rely.  He  always  listened  attentively  to  the
debates and never made interjections, but from his body language  one  could
tell when he did not agree with something said. He was a mischievous  fellow
and a humorous person indeed. Already  with  his  first  appearance  in  the
Chair he proved this. The following quote from Hansard, 26  May  1994  gives
us a small glimpse of this side of him:


  The DEPUTY PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE: Order! Mr President of the  Republic,
  I did not see you come into the Senate. How you managed to slip in  I  do
  not know! I should like to assure you that you are most welcome here ...


  If  you  had  been  present  when  we  started  yesterday,  and  if   the
  congratulations that were expressed could have been  carried  in  dishes,
  you would not have been able to leave this House bearing all  the  dishes
  containing the congratulations!

This was typical of Govan Mbeki. It was an honour to have known him  and  to
have served our wonderful country with him. May his family  find  solace  in
the fruits of his labour.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I did not have the privilege of knowing the  late
Govan Mbeki personally.  I  was,  however,  personally  privileged  to  live
through a period of transformation in our country, in which the  late  Govan
Mbeki played a profound role. He was part of the  collective  of  leadership
from all sectors of  our  society  that  led  us  away  from  the  cycle  of
violence.

One only has to contemplate where we are today and what might have been,  to
appreciate the debt  that  we  collectively  owe  to  these  leaders.  As  a
collective, these leaders showed courage, humility, foresight and wisdom.  I
said that they had courage because they not only talked to  parties  that  a
very short while before had been their enemies, but also had the courage  to
listen  to  opposing  points  of  view  and  face   their   own   respective
constituencies and negotiate acceptance of what  must  have  been,  in  many
circumstances, difficult compromises.

I said that these leaders showed humility because  of  the  very  fact  that
they were willing to listen to,  appreciate  and  substantially  accommodate
different points of view. I said that these  leaders  showed  foresight  and
wisdom because they appreciated that for  this  transformation  to  succeed,
each and every individual had  to  be  allowed  to  play  a  part  and  feel
included in  this  transformation.  Despite  their  undoubted  achievements,
there is still a long way to go.

The most fitting tribute we can give to the late Govan Mbeki  is  to  ensure
that what he and others initiated continues to build  on  solid  foundations
and ultimately succeeds. The DP supports the motion  of  condolence  to  our
President and his family.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, there is  a  saying  that  goes,  ``In  the
factory we make cosmetics, but in the shop we sell hope.'' I only know  from
what I heard what the hon Mbeki did during the struggle,  but  I  know  from
what I experienced from him as a Senator, Deputy  President  of  the  Senate
and a colleague in the NCOP, that he sold hope.

A person's reputation - and  many  of  us  have  realised  this  colleague's
reputation only now, after his death - is a mixture  of  what  his  friends,
enemies and relatives say behind  his  back.  And  it  is  only  myself  and
colleague Neels Ackermann from the opposition who are still  in  this  House
and who started to serve in this Chamber with Senator Govan Mbeki.

Today I can state, without any  doubts,  that  we  always  had  the  biggest
appreciation for this father of and from the struggle.

As ek terugdink aan die gryskop wat  daar  oorkant,  en  soms  hier  in  die
stoel, gesit het, en ek sien die kop wat so effens bewe,  en  die  innemende
glimlag wat daar altyd op sy gesig was, is dit vandag vir my baie maklik  om
te sê: Rus in vrede, kollega Mbeki, rus in  vrede,  senator  Mbeki,  rus  in
vrede, oom Gov. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[When I recall the grey-haired man who used to sit on the  other  side,  and
sometimes in the Chair here, and I picture the head, nodding  slightly,  and
the endearing smile which was always on his face, I have  no  difficulty  in
saying today: Rest in peace, colleague Mbeki, rest in peace, Senator  Mbeki,
rest in peace, Oom Gov.]

Mrs N J VILAKAZI: Chairperson, on behalf of the  IFP  and  KwaZulu-Natal  no
words could ever be adequate to express the way we felt on the departure  of
one of the  greatest  sons  and  heroes  to  ever  walk  the  face  of  this
continent.

As many have proclaimed, the late Uncle Govan, who through the grace of  God
brought to this world our President in this new South Africa, was a  man  of
impeccable character, a veteran indeed. He inspired those  around  him  with
passion and devotion that he portrayed  not  only  to  his  family  and  the
people around him, but also to the whole country. As a  testimony  to  this,
his last wish was that he be laid to rest amongst his own people  regardless
of their socioeconomic status.

As the IFP, we extend our condolences to the President and  his  family.  We
say, when he was born they rejoiced, for the son  was  being  added  to  the
family, and now that he has passed on, the whole world cries with them.  May
they find strength and solace in knowing that our thoughts and  prayers  are
with them in this time of bereavement. Glory be to God for his life, for  he
led the life of a hero.

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson and hon members, I stand  here  this  afternoon
to reiterate my  party's  motion  of  condolence,  which  has  been  already
transmitted directly to the bereaved Mbeki family,  on  the  loss  of  their
beloved father.

It is very seldom in life that a leader lives long enough to  see  or  enjoy
the fruits of his labour. This statement  corroborates  our  Setswana  idiom
which  says,  ``Modiri  ga  se  moji,''  which  means  that   under   normal
circumstances a person who has worked hard for the achievement of a  certain
goal usually dies long before its realisation.

However, today we are gathered here  as  colleagues  and  comrades  to  bear
witness to a stalwart who defied and belied the normal course of events.  He
lived long enough to see and enjoy the democratic  Government  that  he  had
cherished and suffered for. However, this was not all that  made  his  heart
rejoice. To  crown  it  all,  he  saw  his  own  son,  Thabo,  assuming  the
presidential reins, and I  think  that  he  goes  to  his  heavenly  home  a
delighted man. May his soul rest in peace.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I came to know Mr Govan Mbeki  very  briefly  in
the early nineties. I was the high commissioner in  London,  or  rather  the
ambassador, as it was called at that time. He rang me to do me the  courtesy
of informing me that he was in London on a purely personal  visit  and  that
he did not want to take my time but wanted to do me the courtesy  of  having
rung.

I immediately invited him to our embassy for a cup of tea  and  he  honoured
us with his presence. He arrived and I had the pleasure of showing him  over
the building and talking to him. He was very interested in all  he  saw  and
asked many questions. But what struck me about him was that here  we  had  a
highly civilised, self-effacing and mild-mannered gentleman who, because  of
his noble bearing, immediately commanded respect.  He  had  something  about
him which, I have to say, I can only describe as a sweetness.  We  discussed
much, sharing hopes and fears of our  new  dispensation.  His  remarks  were
always kindly, balanced, and full of wisdom and perspective. He  was  a  man
that one does not easily forget.

The sincere condolences of my party go out to his family at  this  time.  We
salute his memory and support the motion of condolence to the  Mbeki  family
to be put before this House.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Before I ask the Chief Whip to  rise,  I
must add our own condolences, as presiding officers, and  indicate  that  at
the request of the South African CPA delegation we, in fact,  dedicated  the
contribution we made to the conference to the memory of Mr Mbeki,  primarily
because  we  learnt  from  the   secretary-general   of   the   Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association  that  Mr  Mbeki  had  led  South  Africa's  first
parliamentary delegation when we  rejoined  the  Commonwealth  Parliamentary
Association. Therefore we were able to inform the  conference  of  his  loss
and dedicate our contribution to his memory.

Debate concluded.

THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I think that we have  spoken  in
one very powerful voice as a collective,  provinces  and  political  parties
included.

I move the draft resolution printed in  my  name  on  the  Order  Paper,  as
follows:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the passing on of Govan "Oom Gov"  Mbeki,  a  stalwart  of  the
       struggle for the liberation of the people of South Africa;


  (2) recognises the valuable contribution he made -


       (a)  as Deputy President of the then  Senate  and  a  member  of  the
           Council in strengthening our democracy;


       (b)   as  an  educator,  prolific  writer,  publicist  and  respected
           revolutionary intellectual; and


       (c)  as freedom fighter  and  champion  for  the  poor  and  for  the
           marginalised rural communities of our country;


  (3) notes the selfless sacrifices he made relentlessly  in  the  struggle
       for freedom, democracy and the building of  a  united  and  nonracial
       South Africa;


  (4) believes that he served the nation with  dedication,  discipline  and
       unwavering commitment and that he will be an  inspiration  to  future
       generations; and


  (5) expresses its sincere condolences to his wife, his son the President,
       and the entire Mbeki family in the knowledge that  the  whole  nation
       mourns the loss of this noble son of Africa.

Motion agreed to in terms of section 65 of the Constitution.

                                 NEW MEMBERS

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP:  Order!  We  have  dealt,   members,   with
condolences to Mr Mbeki, who has now left us. I must, before we  proceed  to
the next matter, inform the House of beginnings that start  from  this  day.
Those beginnings are to welcome  three  new  hon  members  to  the  National
Council of Provinces. They are: Mr Windvoël, who I  am  not  sure  is  here.
[Interjections.]  He  is  not  present.  I  hope  this  is  not  a  pattern.
[Laughter.] Mr Windvoël represents the Mpumalanga  province.  [Applause.]  I
also welcome Mr Ralane, who represents the Free State, and Mr Tolo,  who  is
also of Mpumalanga province. [Applause.]

You are welcome, hon members, and we look forward to your  contributions  to
the National Council.

                         INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PEACE

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Ms S N NTLABATI: Chairperson, let the House be  sure  that  I  am  standing.
[Laughter.] The Bloemfontein airport is small and it takes  one  minute  or,
at the most, two minutes to pass through. But last week  this  was  not  the
case. For all of us who were there at that time our talk was  around  death,
destruction, devastation, anxiety, anger, retaliation and revenge.  We  also
thought about bruised soldiers of peace lying beneath ruins and the  rubble,
screaming for tolerance and peace throughout the  ages.  Their  voices  have
never been heard and the halo of peace has been shattered for ever.
As we assemble here to celebrate the International Day of Peace,  new  words
have to be found to describe the depths of doom into  which  our  world  has
fallen. The rhetoric of war has become the barter  between  fellow  citizens
and fellow citizens, African and African, Asian and Asian,  Palestinian  and
Jew.

What the world saw last week and what was so brilliantly sensationalised  by
the mass media transcends our worst fears. How does anyone,  or  a  teacher,
explain this utter indifference  to  the  sanctity  of  human  life  to  our
children?  The  truth  is  a  mystery.  Although  there  are  requests   for
restraint, the quest for revenge has certainly reached the highest pitch.

Despite the efforts to harmonise societies and nations, despite  the  annual
decoration of individuals and groups with the Nobel Peace  prize  and  other
global humanitarian awards, we as citizens of the world have failed to  feel
the cleavages between nations,  cleavages  that  have  their  roots  in  one
simple English word: ideology. Ideologies set off hatred, conflict  and  war
and stem from the fact that I think my ideology  is  superior  to  the  next
person's ideology. This is unfounded, because history has demonstrated  that
ideologies do become outdated.

It is my and my Government's unyielding conviction upon the  culmination  of
this International Day of Peace that the world needs permanent peace,  peace
that is predicated upon freedom, equality, brotherhood  and  sisterhood.  We
have to endeavour, in all our  diversity,  to  ensure  that  the  artificial
schisms that separate us as a  nation  and  nations  of  the  world  do  not
remain. We must cease to pursue the politics of  selfishness  and  start  to
display the  attributes  of  global  citizenship.  We  need  to  demonstrate
compassion and tolerance when dealing with our  own  citizens,  as  well  as
with those who seek refuge on our shores.

We must also accept responsibility for the damage and the harm we are  doing
to our environment. These objectives could well have been mentioned  at  the
World Conference against Racism in Durban recently. We, in the ANC,  believe
they are, in fact, noble and are worth being sought in  this  21st  century.
Some will argue that these objectives are hopelessly  idealistic,  but  they
will all contribute in different  ways  towards  the  conditions  that  will
change the features of this planet and then there will be peace.
They will never eliminate  centuries  of  affliction  some  nations  had  to
suffer. Neither will they create the utopian society we are  all  clamouring
for. They will take decades, perhaps lifetimes,  to  bear  fruit,  but  they
could reduce, dramatically, the  need  to  deploy  the  machinery  of  death
against those whom the world has alienated. [Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Mevrou die  Voorsitter,  presies  'n  week  gelede  op  die
minuut is nie alleen New York, Washington DC  en  die  Verenigde  State  van
Amerika nie, maar die hele wêreld  tot  in  sy  fondamente  geruk  deur  die
ergste en gruwelikste terroriste-aanval denkbaar waarin duisende  onskuldige
mense in 'n oomblik van waansin omgekom het.

Dit is sekerlik die grootste skok wat die  mensdom  nog  in  my  en  in  die
meeste van ons hier  teenwoordig  se  lewe  getref  het.  Die  gevoelens  en
gedagtes wat deur 'n mens se  brein  geflits  het  terwyl  die  verskriklike
gebeure voor ons oë op televisie afgespeel het, is  onbeskryfbaar.  Dit  was
asof 'n mens nie kon glo dat wat jy sien die werklikheid  is  of  selfs  kán
wees nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Madam Chair, exactly one week ago to the  minute  not  only
New York, Washington DC and the United States  of  America,  but  the  whole
world was  shaken  to  its  foundations  by  the  worst  and  most  gruesome
terrorist attack conceivable in which thousands of innocent people  perished
in one moment of madness.

This must surely be the biggest shock ever to  have  struck  mankind  in  my
life and that of most of us present here. The feelings  and  thoughts  which
flashed through one's mind while the terrible events were  unfolding  before
our eyes on television are beyond description. It was as if  one  could  not
believe that what we were seeing could be, or could  even  approximate,  the
truth.]

The attacks on New York and  Washington  were  not  simply  attacks  on  the
United States, but attacks on freedom  and  democracy  worldwide.  It  is  a
bitter irony that the Culture of Peace Week, which is the  annual  highlight
of the United Nations International  Decade  for  a  Culture  of  Peace  and
Nonviolence for the Children of the World 2001 to 2010, began last  Tuesday,
11 September 2001, with the International Day of Peace and  concludes  today
with the Hear the Children Day of Peace.
Since 1983 the  third  Tuesday  of  September  has  been  designated  as  an
international day of peace. On this day, as an expression of the  ``We,  the
peoples'' initiative, citizens of many nations are joining in  a  moment  of
silence at noon in each time zone, lighting a candle  and  sending  a  light
wave of peace around the world for 24 hours. Two themes for this  initiative
are, ``Out of many,  one  Unity  in  Diversity''  and  ``Peace  begins  with
oneself, living in harmony with one another and the earth.''

Recently, the United Nations changed the International  Day  of  Peace,  the
day on which the General  Assembly  opens,  to  the  Tuesday  following  the
second Monday of every September, during  which  a  minute  of  silence  for
peace is traditionally observed.

The one thing that President George Bush said after  this  terrible  tragedy
that stuck in my mind is that adversity introduces one  to  oneself.  It  is
important in  times  like  this  that  we  all  examine  ourselves  and  our
relationship with our  God  and  with  others,  because  peace  begins  with
ourselves, living in harmony with our Creator, with  one  another  and  with
the earth.

In the 1995 World Summit of Children report, it is stated that:


  We, the young peoples of the earth, propose that  the  third  Tuesday  of
  every September also be known worldwide as Hear  the  Children's  Day  of
  Peace. On this day ...

Today also.


  ... we would like to be given the opportunity to voice our  opinions  and
  ideas.

I have therefore thought it fit to conclude by quoting  -  may  I  say  with
full approval - from one of the winning  essays  of  the  2001  Luthuli-Tutu
Peace in Africa awards, written by a  child,  Raihan  Suliman,  a  Grade  11
pupil at the Witbank High School. I want us to listen  to  what  this  child
has to say to us on this day the Hear the Children Day of Peace:


  Our lives, which are monumental odysseys, require certain  qualities  and
  values. These include the quality of respect. This is the admiration  for
  a person's good qualities, whether this respect is for a different  race,
  a different culture  or  a  different  nation.  With  respect,  we  as  a
  continent, can unite in bringing peace to our beloved land.


  While staring at the world map I see a continent in the centre with  hope
  and dreams, hope  that  one  day  peace  may  prevail  with  this  entire
  continent and every inhabitant may lift  their  heads  and  proudly  say,
  ``Nkosi Sikelele iAfrica''. Let us focus on our  goals,  learn  from  our
  mistakes, maximise our potential and actualise our vision  for  peace  in
  Africa.


  We look forward to the future  and  its  challenges  that  face  us  with
  confidence and faith that God will bless our honest efforts and  fill  us
  with love, hope and strength to make progress to build  a  better  nation
  and, may I add, a better world for us all.

It is important to hear what our children have to  say,  what  their  dreams
and aspirations are, and not only on the Hear the Children's Day  of  Peace.
[Applause.]

Me C S BOTHA: Mevrou die Voorsitster,  die  ironie  van  hierdie  debat  oor
internasionale vrede, terwyl ons omring word deur  die  teenwoordigheid  van
'n dreigende derde wêreldoorlog, sal niemand ontsnap  nie.  Miskien  is  dit
juis hierdie kontras wat die nodigheid van internasionale  vrede  helder  in
reliëf gooi.

Gedurende die laaste dekade was daar  49  streekskonflikte  wat  12  miljoen
vlugtelinge tot gevolg gehad het. In 1999 het  15  lande  gestaak,  maar  12
nuwes is by die konflik gevoeg. Volgens die  Stockholm  International  Peace
Research Institute het die belangrikste konflikte in die jaar 2000,  waarvan
daar 23 was, gedraai om 'n verskeidenheid antagonistiese groepe  wat  gedryf
is deur politieke ambisie, ekonomiese motiewe, ideologie en vrees.

Ons het dus nie soveel te doen met 'n uitsonderlike situasie nie, as met  'n
kontinuum van  gebeure.  Selfs  ons  huidige  debat  oor  globalisasie  blyk
duidelik een van akademiese aard te wees. Daar is geen ontsnapping  van  die
gevolge van die wêreldpolitiek en -dinamiek nie. Of dit sleur 'n  mens  mee,
óf jy gee rigting daaraan. Dit is waar die keuse lê.

Die skoenlappereffek, wat in 1963 bekendheid verwerf het as  die  sogenaamde
``chaos teorie'', is gegrond op 'n  soortgelyke  beginsel.  Die  meteoroloog
Edward Lorenz het  gevind  dat  baie  klein  veranderinge  in  'n  komplekse
stelsel, soos die planetêre weerstelsel, tot geweldige groot  en  onverwagte
nagevolge kan lei. Om die effek te beskryf, is die analogie van  die  enkele
slag van 'n skoenlapper se vlerk gemaak. Een slag van 'n  vlerk  sal  vandag
'n  skaars  merkbare  verandering  in  die  toestand   van   ons   atmosfeer
veroorsaak. Die resultaat is egter dat oor 'n gegewe tydperk  die  atmosfeer
sal afwyk van wat daarsonder  sou  gebeur  het.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Ms C S BOTHA: Madam Chairperson, the irony of this debate on  international
peace, while we are surrounded by the presence of a threatening third  world
war, will not escape anyone. Perhaps it  is  precisely  this  contrast  that
would give clear perspective to the necessity of international peace.

During the last decade there were 49 regional conflicts, which  produced  12
million refugees. In 1999, 15 countries withdrew, but  12  new  ones  joined
the conflict.  According  to  the  Stockholm  International  Peace  Research
Institute the most important conflicts in the  year  2000,  of  which  there
were 23, revolved around a  variety  of  groups  of  antagonists  driven  by
political ambition, economic motives, ideology and fear.

We are therefore not dealing so much with an exceptional situation  as  with
a continuum of events. Even our  current  debate  on  globalisation  clearly
appears to be an academic debate. There is no escaping the  consequences  of
world politics and dynamics. It either carries one  away  or  one  gives  it
direction. That is where the choice lies.

The butterfly effect,  which  gained  notoriety  as  the  so-called  ``chaos
theory'' in 1963, is based on a similar principle. The meteorologist  Edward
Lorenz found that many small changes  in  a  complex  system,  such  as  the
planetary weather system, could  cause  tremendously  major  and  unexpected
consequences. To describe the effect the analogy  was  made  of  the  single
stroke of a butterfly's wings. One stroke  of  a  wing  today  will  make  a
barely discernible change in the condition of the  atmosphere.  The  result,
however, is that in a given time  the  atmosphere  will  deviate  from  what
would have happened had this not taken place.]

So it is with nations and persons. In a report  by  Kofi  Annan  on  Durable
Peace and Sustainable  Development  in  Africa,  he  states  that  in  those
nations making efforts in good faith and adopting enlightened  policies  and
where the international community is committed to making  a  difference,  it
has shown that significant transformation can be achieved.

But, he continues, there are  places  where  governments  and  rebel  groups
persist in spending money on weapons they can ill afford. There  are  places
where whole economies have come to depend on the perpetuation of war,  where
political power has been attained by violent, undemocratic means, and  where
poor governance deprives people of basic needs.

It would be well to bear these opposing states in  mind  when  we  sit  with
clutched hearts and wonder what the Bush government  and  the  international
community are going to do. The United States leadership guide has  a  three-
step problem-solving process: recognise the problem,  make  an  estimate  of
the situation and take action. This would apply as much to  war  as  to  the
peace process.

Herman Melville's famous words seem chillingly appropriate:
  We cannot live only for ourselves. A thousand fibres connect us with  our
  fellow men, and among those fibres, as sympathetic threads,  our  actions
  run as causes, and they come back to us as effects.

It is abundantly clear that we cannot isolate ourselves  from  the  rest  of
the world, we are part  of  it.  Nor  does  it  help  to  sing  Bob  Dylan's
plaintive lyrics ``God is on our side''. In religion  lies  the  ability  to
provide international peace or to destroy it. And  it  is  about  time  that
this world of ours learns one simple truth: that God is on  all  our  sides,
that humanity is not divisible, that peace is not divisible,  and  that  the
point at which to start with proof is at the point of the  butterfly's  wing
- in this Chamber, starting with each of us. [Applause.]

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, peace is  an  outcome.  It  is  not  a  process,
because a process  requires  equal  justice,  and  a  fair  distribution  of
resources, which requires cultural understanding, democracy  and  a  rights-
based culture. Therefore, to ensure that  there  is  peace,  there  must  be
democracy. In short, there will be no peace without democracy.  Economically
speaking, poor nations of the world must be  helped  to  develop  themselves
economically.  Economic  development  of  poor  nations  would  mean  actual
stability in the whole world.

Therefore, global peace can be  achieved  if  there  is  reverence  for  the
sanctity of life and respect for life. There can be global  peace  if  there
is respect and celebration of  diversity  in  respect  of  race,  ethnicity,
religion, culture,  language,  tradition,  custom,  etc.  We  need  to  have
respect for  humanity.  Therefore,  nations  of  the  world  must  begin  to
appreciate and strive to belong to the family of humanity.

What  happened  to  the  USA  augurs  very  badly  for  world  peace.   That
catastrophe, to many of us, is a recipe for the Third World  War.  As  such,
we reject it as an abominable act of brutality on innocent human  lives.  We
urge the nations of the world to  unite  and  uproot  whatever  caused  that
catastrophe, and, at the same time, prevent any possibility  of  the  advent
of the Third World War. Peace on earth, peace in the world. [Applause.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Madam Chair, the 2001 to 2010  decade  has  been  proclaimed
the International Decade for a Culture of  Peace  and  Nonviolence  for  the
Children of the World by the United Nations.  The  SADC's  heads  of  states
have unequivocally welcomed and adopted this proclamation.

It is not the first time that people's  hopes  for  world  peace  have  been
embedded in their thinking. The president of the USA, Woodrow  Wilson,  once
had the same dream. He was a staunch idealist whose  hope  for  world  peace
was immersed in his thinking during 1917. We are told that when he  returned
to the White House from the war with Germany in 1917, he  put  his  head  on
the table and sobbed. Many thought that World War I would be the war to  end
all wars.

President Wilson was a leading advocate for the League of Nations, which  he
hoped would  ensure  peace.  Subsequent  to  World  War  I,  the  world  has
experienced World War II - in the year in which  I  was  born  -  protracted
Middle East wars, the execution of Christian converts, genocides in the  DRC
and Burundi, wars between Ethiopians and Eritreans and  the  destruction  of
innocent human life in Angola, simply on account of leadership ambition,  as
well as the recent destruction of the World Trade Centre  and  the  Pentagon
in the USA. This leaves us with the question: Can this world ever know  true
peace?

Henry G Bosch once uttered the following words:  ``Because  we  can  neither
change the past nor manipulate the future, we are peaceless.''

The world today lives in hatred. Our hearts are  harnessed  to  fear,  hate,
selfishness and greed. We are  told  that  almost  3  000  years  ago,  King
Solomon made three insightful observations about the rat  race  of  life.  I
shall only  highlight  one  observation.  He  observed  that  there  was  an
inherent desire in most human beings to outdo or destroy their  fellow  man,
that this was the motive behind much of human industriousness and that  this
culminated in a no-win situation.

Man has first to be at peace with himself. For the purpose of amplifying  my
argument, may I quote:


  People come in all sizes, colour and  conditions.  Before  we  set  aside
  those who do  not  match  our  personal  standards,  we  need  to  remind
  ourselves that our Creator does not play favourites.

Conventions and summits for world peace only serve as  ceremonial  gestures,
rather than bona fide forums for ensuring true regional or world peace.

Human society today is entangled in a  life  of  hate,  ambition,  jealousy,
dissension, etc. For true world peace to materialise, we  should  allow  the
Holy Spirit to control mankind. It is  only  then  that  joy,  love,  peace,
kindness, faithfulness and self-control will be  an  integral  part  of  our
lives. It is then that the dream of world leaders such as  former  president
Woodrow Wilson for true world peace could come true.

In conclusion, may I leave this House, once more, with  this  question:  Can
this world ever know true peace? [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, hon members of this House,  the  limited  time
at my disposal did not allow me to do in-depth research into the  origin  of
this, the International Day of Peace, and the circumstances that  gave  rise
to it. However, it is not an unknown fact  that  man  is  generally  not  at
peace with himself, let alone with his neighbours. [Interjections.]

If he is a rich man, he wants to amass more wealth, and the more  wealth  he
accumulates, the more he wants, even to the  extent  of  wanting  the  whole
world and creation under his subordination and control.

Today is the International Day of Peace. Our responsibility is to  cultivate
the awareness that we are all,  irrespective  of  race,  colour  and  creed,
members of a global community of life, and that we share  a  common  mission
and responsibility for the future of our country. This day of  peace  almost
coincided with the day of  war  during  which  the  World  Trade  Centre  in
America was bombed by unknown forces of evil.

I also wish to join the chorus of condemnation of the perpetrators  of  that
ghastly deed who had absolutely no regard for the sanctity of human life.  I
also wish to condemn terrorism, and support  the  idea  that  terrorists  be
traced  and  dealt  with  according  to  the  lawful  prescriptions  of  the
particular country.

The mobilisation of military  forces  in  order  to  retaliate  against  the
countries that are allegedly harbouring the suspects  is  not  conducive  to
the building of this rare commodity called peace. Many innocent lives  would
be lost in the  same  manner  as  in  the  attack  by  the  terrorists  and,
therefore,  there  would  be  no  difference  between  the  actions  of  the
terrorists and of the civilised Christian country. However, America must re-
examine itself look deep into itself to consider what its role  was  in  the
past  when  other   countries   suffered   similar   bombings.   [Applause.]
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Order!

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I just wish to thank  my  colleagues  for  their
speeches and for renewing my faith in our country. I think there  have  been
some wonderful contributions.

Today we are discussing, of course, the International Day  of  Peace,  at  a
time when war clouds are gathering  that  threaten  that  peace,  after  the
cowardly and barbaric attack by  international  terrorists  upon  the  vital
international organisations' buildings in New York and the other US  targets
last week.  Unfortunately,  therefore,  we  cannot  celebrate  international
peace, but what we can do is to commit ourselves and  redouble  our  efforts
to strive for that elusive peace.
We in the Cape can sympathise very strongly with all of those who were  hurt
recently, because our own city,  Cape  Town,  has  been  the  target  of  65
terrorist attacks these past few years. We forget so quickly. Some of  these
attacks also appear to have had  international  sponsors  and  international
connections.

I think, for example, of the cowardly attack upon Planet Hollywood.  In  our
hour of need we had the welcome support of the FBI of  the  US,  who,  along
with others, continue to help our security services to  meet  the  challenge
to our  security,  safety  and  freedom  posed  by  acts  of  terrorism  and
lawlessness.

It is right, therefore, for our President to say, and  we  support  what  he
said, that we will do everything possible to lend whatever help  and  advice
we can to contribute to hunting  down  the  dangerous  criminals  that  have
perpetrated these heinous terrorist crimes, and against whom all  peace  and
freedom-loving peoples are mobilising around the world.

I say ``around the world'' because it is  true  that  in  the  Middle  East,
Europe, the Far East, Africa and the  Americas,  all  civilised  people  are
standing together against this new threat to civilisation.

If it is allowed to continue,  the  whole  fabric  of  society  will  become
threatened. Anyone travelling anywhere, for whatever purpose,  can  suddenly
become  the  innocent  victim  of  a  horrendous   crime,   indiscriminately
perpetrated.

The civilised world needs to unite and will act  against  these  individuals
and, where necessary, against collaborators that  host  these  international
criminals.

The acts of recent times strike against all peace-loving people  everywhere,
and  that  is  why  we  need  to  denounce,  reject  and  condemn  terrorism
unconditionally wherever and whenever it raises its ugly head.

Our hearts go out to all those who  have  directly  or  indirectly  suffered
loss of life and property in these deadly attacks, as well as to  those  who
are called to deal with the dangerous aftermath.

It is our earnest hope that where possible the criminals  involved  will  be
delivered from wherever they are, so that the law can take  its  course  and
justice can prevail. For the world to be safe  for  democracy,  for  liberty
and freedom, it needs to be unsafe for those that violate that very peace.

May God bless those who have  suffered  in  these  horrendous  attacks.  May
President Bush and his government and other  governments  around  the  world
receive the strength, the ability, the support and the  courage  to  respond
effectively, wisely and swiftly to international terrorism  to  remove  this
growing cancer from the globalising world.

We strongly support the words of our President, recently said on  behalf  of
our nation in response to President Bush after the recent tragedy.  May  God
bless all of those who must seek peace on our behalf. [Applause.]

THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I would  like  to  believe  that
today we celebrate the capacity and the will of humankind to  achieve  peace
and live in tolerance and harmony. As Mr Matthee correctly pointed out,  the
events as they unfolded on the television  screens  were  somewhat  surreal.
We, too, have felt the anger, the anxiety, the  anguish  and  the  shame  of
those people - both the Americans and those people all over  the  world.  We
also shared in the suffering of the people, not only from America, but  from
all nations, who were victims of the attack.

Mr  Matthee  also  emphasised   one   particular   element,   which,   quite
interestingly, is one of the principles of the United  Nations  declaration.
It  is  an  overemphasis  on  the  material  wellbeing  of  nations  and  an
underemphasis on their spiritual wellbeing.

I think what Mr Tlhagale has  said  is  perhaps  correct,  namely  that  one
should not be overhasty, injudicious and indiscriminate in terms of  how  we
respond. When Miss Ntlabati spoke, somebody commented about her height,  but
I think it is her words that we should pay attention to, and I refer to  the
last part of what she had to say. She  spoke  of  the  bruised  soldiers  of
peace lying beneath the ruins. Will  we  hear  their  cries  for  peace  and
tolerance, or shall the fragile halo of peace be forever shattered?

I think this is the choice that humanity is facing.

We share the pain and suffering of people in America, in Kenya, in  Nairobi,
in Palestine, and in China - all those who have been afflicted by  violence.
But we do, as we have proved quite demonstrably  in  South  Africa,  believe
that by recognising the diversity of nations, by having a firm  resolve  and
a will to achieve peace and harmony, we can, as a global community,  achieve
peace and harmony.

Debate concluded.

                         INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PEACE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, we  have,  together,  crafted  a
motion which I would like to  put  before  the  House,  which  reflects  the
thinking and the understanding of all political parties and  representatives
of this House. With your kind permission I would like to put the  motion  to
the House. I therefore move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that today is the International Day of Peace;


  (2) further notes that today is the culmination of the "Hear the Children
       Day of Peace Programme";


  (3) believes that global peace can only be achieved if there is -


       (a)  reverence for the sanctity of life;


       (b)  respect for freedom under the law;


       (c)  respect  for  the  diversity  in  respect  of  race,  ethnicity,
           religions, cultures, languages, traditions and customs;


       (d)  social justice which seeks to redress  the  disparities  between
           the rich and the poor; and


       (e)  a will to eliminate all forms of racism and related intolerance;


  (4) recognises South Africa's efforts in creating a  diverse  and  united
       country by entrenching -


       (a)  the rights of cultural, religious and linguistic communities;


       (b)  the bedrock values of human dignity, equality and freedom; and


       (c)  a policy of engagement and discussion with a view  to  achieving
           global harmony and peace;


  (5) shares in the anguish and the grief suffered by innocent  victims  of
       intolerance, violence and injustice wherever it occurs; and


  (6) enjoins the global community to strive for peace and harmony.

[Applause.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      CLOSE CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)
The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY:  Madam  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy
Chairperson, hon members, when the Close  Corporations  Act  was  passed  by
Parliament in 1984 the electronic processing of documentation was not yet  a
reality, and the Act consequently did not cater for it. Amendments  to  this
Act are therefore necessary in order to keep  abreast  with  trends  in  the
electronic or automated registration of close corporations.

Approximately four years ago the SA Companies Regulatory  Office,  which  we
call  Sacro  for  short,  embarked  on  the  development  of  a   completely
electronic and computerised system for the incorporation  of  companies  and
close corporations. This new  process  also  includes  the  registration  of
corporate documentation and other information in respect of these  entities,
and means that another of the primary functions of the registration  office,
which  is  the  disclosure  of  corporate  information,  can  be   performed
electronically.

The ultimate goal here is to provide a better  service  to  the  public  and
stakeholders  in  South  Africa,  and  to  assist  in   attracting   foreign
investment through proper disclosure. It must  be  clearly  understood  that
this new system has been developed as an additional  functionality,  and  it
will  not  in  the  immediate  future  replace  the   existing   paper-based
structures and procedures of  lodgment  of  documents  at  the  registration
office. In time it may, however, become the main way  of  dealing  with  the
registration  office  as  it  moves  from  a  totally  manual  system  to  a
semicomputerised  one,  which  is  the  stage  where  we  are  at  now,  and
ultimately to a totally computerised system.

This new system was developed in co-operation with the SA  Revenue  Service,
various state departments and other regulators and interested  parties  from
the private sector.  The  development  phase  has  been  finalised  and  the
registration office is now ready for the further  implementation  of  a  new
system.

Allow me to turn to the amending Bill itself. The Bill  aims  to  amend  the
Close Corporations Act of 1984 to legally enable the lodgement of  documents
and disclosure of information in respect of close corporations by  means  of
electronic  processes.  The  Bill  therefore  seeks  to  introduce  enabling
provisions  regarding  the  following  matters:  the  phasing  in   of   the
electronic lodgment of corporate forms, the phasing  in  of  the  electronic
payment of prescribed fees and other fees  for  services  rendered  and  the
electronic disclosure of corporate information.

The  new  system  has  already  been  partly  implemented.  All   kinds   of
documentation lodged with the registration office, which  currently  run  to
about 9 000 documents per day for both  close  corporations  and  companies,
are recorded on an electronic tracking system. The benefits of  this  system
are that the staff at Sacro  have  instant  information  pertaining  to  the
status of applications and the whereabouts of historic files.  We  are  also
told that the system has enabled them to reduce  telephonic  enquiries  from
200 000 per month to less than 100 000.

This tracking system makes it possible to  determine  at  any  time  exactly
when any document has been received, and what its current status in  respect
of  processing.  This  information  is  already  fully  available   on   the
registration office's Internet website, which is also accessible though  our
own  DTI  website.  For  those  who  are  interested  the  relevant  website
addresses  are:  www.dti.gov.za/sacro  for   the   companies   office;   and
www.dti.gov.za for the general DTI website, that is, our homepage.

One of the main advantages of introducing  this  new  electronic  system  is
that it will enable the registration office to  take  its  registration  and
disclosure services to the people, people in all areas, including  the  most
remote areas  in  South  Africa;  and,  for  that  matter,  the  world  will
eventually be able to access these services through the electronic media.

At first glance it may not seem realistic to take high technology  to  rural
and  remote  areas,  expecting  unsophisticated  people  to   access   these
opportunities. But, the fact is that by doing this, numerous new  points  of
entry into the services of our registration office are being made  available
to the public. In this regard, the decentralisation of  these  services  can
be achieved by  utilising  all  available  outlets  of  Government  offices,
private organisations, private businesses and even individuals  with  access
to the Internet.

An added benefit here is  that  this  will  reduce  the  cost  involved  for
ordinary people, as they will not have to pay lawyers  to  do  searches  for
them. One can do a search, starting with the name of the company  one  wants
to register, to information which tracks  where  one's  documents  are.  One
does not need an attorney to do the searches for one;  one  can  already  do
that through the Internet.

I think, secondly,  that  most  practising  lawyers  will  know  the  second
saving. This will save the cost of two attorneys -  one  in  one's  hometown
and one a correspondent in Pretoria, which is what is  happening  currently.
Because the office is located only  in  Pretoria,  attorneys  all  over  the
country have to appoint somebody in Pretoria as a correspondent.

The end result is that a client pays for both his or her attorney  and  also
for the correspondent's fee. We are hoping  that  this  decentralisation  is
going to avoid the duplication of the cost. I am not sure how  the  Pretoria
attorneys are going to receive this news. [Interjections.] [Laughter]  I  am
happy I am not practising as an attorney anymore.

Currently, there is only one national office  in  Pretoria  providing  these
services, but with a properly managed electronic  central  database  and  an
electronic processing system, which will allow  remote  electronic  lodgment
of documentation  and  requests  for  information,  these  services  can  be
properly and effectively decentralised. This electronic decentralisation  of
services will form part of the next phase of the automation project  at  the
registration office.

The first priority, however, is to create a proper legal environment  within
which to develop and  expand  the  new  system.  With  the  system  properly
implemented, the registration office might well become  a  world  leader  in
registering corporate documents and  disclosure  of  corporate  information,
but in order for the registration office to be able to perform properly  and
deliver what is asked of it and required from it, it  needs  to  conform  to
all the latest technology.

Finally, as the  implementation  progresses  further,  meaningful  benefits,
both tangible and intangible, will be accrued. Some of  these  benefits  are
that our operating costs will be reduced;  we  will  be  in  a  position  to
recover quantifiable costs from Sars, and other government departments,  for
services rendered by  us  which  are  currently  being  borne  by  ourselves
because we are not able to quantify them. This, we are  informed,  is  going
to increase the income of the registration office.
We are also going to be able to enforce regulations  as  stipulated  in  the
Act, because companies will be forced, as  they  register,  to  comply  with
certain  reporting  mechanisms.  Also  because  the  data  is  computerised,
available and accessible, we will be able to  monitor  and  make  sure  that
companies  which  do  not  comply  are  fined.  Currently,  it  is   totally
impossible to enforce the regulations in terms of  the  Act.  With  all  the
benefits that this new system brings, I have  no  doubt  that  all  the  hon
members of this House will support the  Close  Corporation  Amendment  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr S  L  E  FENYANE:  Chairperson,  approximately  four  years  ago  the  SA
Companies Regulatory Office, in co-operation with the  SA  Revenue  Service,
departments of state, other regulators and the private sector,  embarked  on
the development of a completely electronic and computerised system  for  the
incorporation of  close  corporations  and  the  registration  of  corporate
information in respect of such  corporations.  Hence,  the  introduction  of
this Bill before us. I will not repeat what the Minister has  already  said,
which is essentially, what I had prepared in this  paragraph.  I  will  skip
it.

I am pleased to indicate  that  the  select  committee  has  unconditionally
supported the amending Bill, and I hope the  House  will  also  support  the
Bill. This Bill effectively enhances the policies and  objectives  that  the
Government wishes to implement in the formation and  promotion  of  economic
growth  and  technological  accessibility  to  the  broader  South   African
community. It is the reality of our times that the modern world we  live  in
is one driven by technology. According to President Mbeki:


  The extraordinary  revolution  in  modern  technology  offers  ever  more
  powerful and astonishing capabilities, affecting primarily the  developed
  world.

This is the digital divide that  Africa  has  to  close  to  boost  its  own
economy for the benefit  of  its  people,  as  has  been  the  case  in  the
developed countries. Joining the rest of the world in  embracing  technology
will thus benefit South Africa profusely.

The passing of this Bill, I believe, will  provide  an  important  framework
which will benefit all South  Africans.  This  will  encourage  productivity
enhancement and enable South Africans to cross the digital divide with  ease
and, thereby, in the words of Nelson  Mandela,  ``reap  the  fruits  of  the
globalising world that is trying  to  redefine  itself.''  The  Bill  has  a
crucial role to play in directing  resources  to  the  people  and  it  will
benefit the general public in the following  ways:  firstly,  it  will  save
time, energy and expense, as people will not have to travel  long  distances
to register close corporations; secondly, it  will  minimise  administrative
hassles; thirdly, documentation will be safely  stored;  fourthly,  it  will
upgrade skills  and  broaden  knowledge  in  the  area  of  technology;  and
fifthly, South Africans on the outskirts of the  country  and  in  far-flung
areas will be able to register companies without necessarily  having  to  go
to the area designated for registration. Thus, it is without  any  doubt  in
my mind that technology will encourage  growth  within  our  boundaries  and
facilitate the further insertion of the economy into the global mainstream.

On behalf of the select committee I therefore support the amending Bill  and
see it as one of the steps towards putting South Africa  on  the  technology
superhighway. This will prove beneficial for our economy, and  I  am  asking
members to support it. I so move. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 15:41.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Joint Standing Committee on  Intelligence  for  2000-01,
     dated 19 June 2001:


     STATEMENT OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE JSCI


     The end of the Cold War has led to a change  in  the  strategic  threat
     environment internationally  and  this  environment  has  continued  to
     justify the existence of the Intelligence Services to protect  national
     security interests of peoples and  governments  throughout  the  world.
     This   strategic   threat   environment   is   characterized   by   the
     unpredictability,  proliferation  and   diversification   of   national
     security threats.


     The nature of these threats is no longer confined to a nation state and
     is increasingly  becoming  transnational  in  nature.  Organized  crime
     groups, for example, have a significant  impact  on  our  personal  and
     economic  well  being  by  importing  and  selling   drugs,   operating
     prostitution rings, stealing and smuggling people from other  countries
     into South Africa. Terrorist groups raise  funds  and  plan  operations
     here. People guilty of crimes abroad hide out  in  South  Africa.  This
     calls for more co-operation between nations and peoples throughout  the
     world.


     The Government of South Africa has a responsibility to monitor  threats
     to South Africa and South African Citizens so that it can take  action.
     It also has an obligation to contribute to  international  attempts  to
     counter organized crime, terrorism, weapons proliferation  and  similar
     activities.


     The pre-occupation of the Joint Standing Committee, on behalf  of  this
     parliament, has been to:


     * review the focus of our Intelligence Services;
     *      evaluate their efficient and effective use of resources;
     * assess their ability to rise to these new and dynamic challenges in a
         co-operative and co-ordinated manner;
     * working within the framework of the law whilst still  being  able  to
         exercise their craft and creativity; and
     * ensure that they have the necessary  resources  with  which  to  face
         these ever changing challenges.

In these changing international security conditions, we face  the  challenge
of balancing openness and secrecy, which is why the  JSCI  was  established.
The JSCI is there to ensure that the Services do their work without fear  or
favour and in keeping with the legislative  prescripts  laid  down  by  this
Parliament.

We approach our work from the  perspective  that  national  security  is  an
instrument for us to enjoy a better life free from fear and free from  need.
We get to grips with this challenge knowing that our freedom as  individuals
and as a nation needs protection and that the Services have, in  the  course
of their work, to ensure that they respect these strictures.

Gone are the days when the Intelligence Services were a law unto  themselves
as we have been able to  ensure  that  there  is  parliamentary  and  public
accountability. In this regard I am happy to state that  the  Committee  has
found no evidence  regarding  the  contravention  of  the  mandates  by  the
Services.

Equally, we as a people have to ensure that if the Services  are  to  fulfil
their mandates they need our support and  an  optimal  working  environment.
Importantly, the protection of national security is  a  national  enterprise
in which we should do our part.

The appointment of the Inspector General of  Intelligence  is  an  important
element of control over the Intelligence  Services.  This  appointment  will
strengthen the intelligence dispensation and the work of the  Committee  and
will go a long way towards empowering  the  President  and  the  responsible
Ministers in their work of supervision over the Services.

The Committee continues to be an important oversight  instrument  on  behalf
of this Parliament. The challenge facing both the Committee  and  Parliament
is to put  in  place  a  framework  that  would  ensure  that  there  is  no
duplication between the work of  the  JSCI  and  that  of  other  committees
created. In this regard the streamlining of  reporting  lines,  the  ethical
code of behaviour and the regulations and rules governing the  Committee  in
relation to Parliament need to be given priority.

We note with appreciation the emergence of a culture of dealing  sensitively
with matters of  national  security  and  attribute  this  to  the  national
consensus, which has characterized  the  work  of  the  committee  from  the
onset. I hope that this will continue in future.

It is thus my great pleasure to table this annual report of the JSCI to  the
National Assembly and to the National Council of Provinces on behalf of  all
my colleagues, as  required  by  Section  6  of  the  Intelligence  Services
Control Act, 1994 (Act 40 of 1994).

Thank you,

N N Mapisa-Nqakula

Introduction

This report is structured to reflect the  establishment  of  the  JSCI,  its
role and oversight functions. It further reflects on matters that  the  JSCI
handled in the past year.

The Intelligence Services Control  Act  No.  40  of  1994  stipulates  eight
functions to be performed by the Committee. The Act allows the Committee  to
have  limited  access  to  intelligence,  information   and   documents   as
articulated in the Act.  At  all  times  in  performing  its  business,  the
Committee must conduct  its  functions  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the
protection of national security. Contravention of the provision  of  secrecy
by a member of the Committee is an offence and is liable on conviction to  a
fine, or imprisonment for a period not exceeding  five  years.  However  the
challenge presently facing the Committee is to formulate regulations  to  be
adopted by the Rules Committee of Parliament. This  has  arisen  because  of
the experience of the Committee.

At its inception, the law provided that the Committee be constituted by  all
the political parties represented in Parliament. After the  1999  elections,
amendments to the principal Act were effected as per  Section  2(a)  of  the
Intelligence Services Control Bill which requires  that  only  the  majority
party and the first five political majority parties  should  be  represented
on the Committee. The political  parties  represented,  therefore,  are  the
African National Congress (ANC),  Democratic  Party  (DP),  Inkatha  Freedom
Party (IFP), New National Party (NNP), United Democratic Movement (UDM)  and
the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP). The Committee would  like  to
report also that the Honourable Member  Brig-Gen.  P.  Schalkwyk  has  since
replaced the Honourable Member R. Pillay of the Democratic Party.

There are people who pay attention to intelligence matters. Among  them  are
academics, lawyers, journalists, and  other  intelligence  groupings.  These
people have views on what the JSCI should be doing  and  how  it  should  go
about its work. Some of these views have been expressed  in  the  number  of
interactions the JSCI has had with the public.  These  include  round  table
discussions on intelligence. Among issues raised were:


     * Concerns on the protection of the individual rights against abuse  by
         the intelligence apparatus.
     * `Restrictions' on members of the Services who have  terminated  their
         services for one reason or another.
     * Interception of communication and screening of individuals.

Most South Africans  have  a  negative  attitude  towards  the  Intelligence
Services. There are opinions on the way JSCI  conducts  its  business.  Some
opinions contend that the JSCI's main task is to assure Parliament that  the
Intelligence Services are conducting their  intelligence  activities  within
the law. The history of the Intelligence Services of the  Republic  requires
the  JSCI  to  take  this  a  step  further.  In  the  past,  South  African
Intelligence Services were used to suppress all activities that strived  for
support and promotion of human rights and democracy  in  the  Republic.  The
members of the JSCI collectively adopted a resolution to try to change  this
mindset on the part of the citizen of the Republic.

Other opinions contend that the JSCI should  be  confined  to  reporting  to
Parliament only. The Committee would like to remind these people that it  is
the duty of  the  JSCI  to  report  to  the  public  through  Parliament  on
activities of the Intelligence Services. For each and every disclosure  made
by it the JSCI is mindful of national security when going public  on  issues
pertaining to the Services.

In its reporting, the Committee is mindful of the trust and confidence  that
it enjoys from the public as well as from the  Intelligence  Services.  This
trust must be constantly  nurtured.  This  report,  therefore,  fulfils  the
JSCI's legal obligation to Parliament as stipulated in the Act.

Section 2
Oversight Role

The Intelligence Services Control Act No 40 of  1994  as  amended,  provides
for the establishment of a Joint Standing  Committee  on  Intelligence.  The
work of the Committee is to  examine  the  administration,  expenditure  and
policies of our Intelligence Services. The Committee is reported to  by  the
Services under the Official Secrets Act 56 of 1978 and operates  within  the
secrecy code. The Committee is subject to  the  Constitution,  and  performs
the oversight functions set out in  Act  40  of  1994  in  relation  to  the
Intelligence and counter-intelligence functions of the Services and  reports
to Parliament annually. The following is the account of what  the  Committee
has managed to achieve as per its statutory functions:

a.    Order Investigations

The Committee has a responsibility to order an  investigation  into  on  any
matter reported to it either by the member of the public or  a  member  from
the Intelligence Services. The Committee can either order Heads of  Services
or the  Inspector  General  of  Intelligence  Services  to  investigate  the
matter.

In  the  past  year  the  only  order  was  for  the  Inspector  General  to
investigate the allegation of recruitment  of  journalists  by  the  Defence
Intelligence. The Committee has not yet received the report on the matter.

b.    Refer matters to Human Rights Commission

No complaint has been received  that  relates  to  abuse  of  Human  Rights,
therefore nothing has been referred to the Human Rights  Commission  in  the
past year.

The Committee intends to improve relations with the Human Rights  Commission
so as to have sound interaction on matters that relate to  the  Services  in
particular.

c.    Consider any other matter referred to it

The only matter that was referred to the JSCI was  from  the  South  African
Secret Service. The matter involved one of the JSCI members.  The  Committee
can report that the  matter  has  been  dealt  with  appropriately  and  was
concluded.

d.    Hold Hearings and to request attendance

The Services have appeared before the Committee to answer certain  questions
on several occasions. See annexure I for detail.

e.    To review and make  recommendations  regarding  interdepartmental  co-
     operation and the rationalisation and demarcation of functions relating
     to intelligence and counter-intelligence between SASS, SANDF and SAPS.

The annual presentations to the Committee by each of the Services' Heads  on
performance, current priorities, future plans and finances took  place  from
February to April 2001. To ensure that the Committee is kept fully  informed
on the full range of the Services' activities, additional programme of  more
frequent briefings to the Committee on the Services'  priorities,  successes
and problems have been agreed upon.
The current mandate of the Services as stipulated in the National  Strategic
Intelligence Act, 1994 is still relevant and  does  not  warrant  a  review.
However,  co-ordination  of  the  intelligence  activities   needs   to   be
strengthened  to  eradicate  duplication  of  resources   and   sources   of
information. Areas of overlap have  to  be  addressed  by  NICOC  so  as  to
improve intelligence efficiency. The  integration  of  signals  intelligence
capability,  which  is  currently  being  driven   by   the   Ministry   for
Intelligence, is of importance is welcomed by the Committee.

f.    Consultation with Cabinet Members

The fundamental principle of democracy  is  that  the  executive  should  be
accountable to Parliament. The setting up of the  Joint  Standing  Committee
on Intelligence at the  inception  of  democracy  in  this  country  was  an
inevitable process of social  evolution.  The  provision  for  an  Oversight
Committee on  Intelligence  in  the  Constitution  was  meant  to  make  the
Intelligence  Services   accountable   to   Parliament.   This   independent
parliamentary scrutiny of  the  Intelligence  Services  has  helped  prevent
crises in the Intelligence Services and has improved  public  confidence  in
the operations of all the Intelligence Services of the Republic.

The Committee has only had  meetings  with  the  Minister  for  Intelligence
Services. The Committee has not had the  opportunity  of  meeting  with  the
Ministers of Safety and Security and of Defence. This situation  should  not
be allowed to continue. Time has  to  be  found  for  fruitful  interactions
between the JSCI and the Ministries so that issues that affect the  Services
can be dealt with without delay.

g.    Consideration of Reports on the Appropriation of  Funds  for  NIA  and
     SASS

This is an ongoing function, which coincides with the budget  cycle  of  the
Services. The Committee has discharged this  function  without  encountering
any problems from the Agency and the Service.

However, the Committee considers recommending an amendment to  the  Act  for
purposes of Defence  Intelligence  and  Crime  Intelligence  reports  to  be
included for consideration also by the Committee.
h.    Nomination of the Inspector-General of Intelligence

In March 2000, the Committee  processed  the  nomination  of  the  Inspector
General of Intelligence Services. The appointment was effected  on  the  1st
of May 2000. At the moment the Ministry, the Committee  and  the  Inspector-
General are looking at the best possible ways of ensuring  that  the  Office
of the Inspector-General can discharge  its  duties  effectively.  They  are
seeking to ensure that the office of the IG can  be  optimally  utilized  by
the  President,  Parliament  (as  public  representatives),  the   Ministers
responsible for  Services  and  the  Intelligence  Services  without  anyone
feeling prejudiced.

The Committee, in attempting to assist and ensure that  the  Office  of  the
Inspector General is set  up  appropriately,  and  adequately  staffed,  has
visited offices of the Inspectors-General in the United States  of  America.
The Committee also attended a conference on Inspector General in Canada.

The Committee concurred with the Ministers  for  Intelligence  Services  and
Defence respectively on the guidelines on the procedures  and  processes  of
setting up the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence.

i.    Determining Conditions of Service of the  Inspector-General  with  the
     President

The conditions of service of the Inspector General were  determined  by  the
Committee and approved by  the  President.  The  JSCI,  the  Office  of  the
President, Minister  of  Defence  and  Minister  for  Intelligence  Services
concurred on regulatory  framework  that  will  govern  the  Office  of  the
Inspector General.

j.    Investigation of the Inspector-General of Intelligence

Since the establishment of the Office of the  Inspector  General  there  was
nothing that warranted the investigation of the Inspector General.

k.    Special reports to JSCI and the President

The special reports could be on:


     * Specific violations committed by the Services
     * Tasks given by the President or Speaker of Parliament
     * Anything that concerns national security, and
     * Complaints from the public

To date nothing has been referred to the Committee, which warranted  special
reports to be issued.

l.    Initiate and Recommend Rules and Orders for the Functions of JSCI

The committee has neither initiated nor recommended  rules  and  orders  for
the functioning of the Committee to Parliament. However, the existing  draft
rules of the Committee are currently under review to fulfil this function.

Section 3
a.    Legislation

1.    General Intelligence Law Amendment Bill

The  Parliamentary  Ad-hoc  Committee  on  the  General   Intelligence   Law
Amendment Bill referred the Bill to the JSCI for consideration.

The objects of the Bill were:


     i.      To  align  the  Intelligence  Services  legislation  with   the
         Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act No  108  of
         1996);
     ii.    To align the disciplinary code and the conditions of service  of
         the Intelligence Services with the new labour trends;
     iii.To make provision for the regulation of strikes in the Intelligence
         Services;
     iv.    To create consultation forums to deal with conditions of service
         and grievances; and
     v.     To regulate the activities of former members of the Intelligence
         Services.

The Committee considered the Bill and unanimously agreed on  the  amendments
and the Bill was adopted.

2.    Review on the Interception and Monitoring Prohibition Act 127 of 1992
The Committee had a meeting with a representative  from  the  South  African
Law Commission on amendments recommended in Act 127. The object of the  Bill
is to amend Act 127 to inter alia:


     * to prohibit the provision of telecommunication services that are  not
         capable of being monitored;
     * to make further provision for consideration of applications;
     * to regulate the monitoring of communications in terms of this Act;
     * to amend the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977, so as to further  regulate
         the obtaining of information as to any alleged offence;
     * to amend the Drugs and drug Trafficking Act, 1996, so as  to  further
         regulate the  delivery  or  submitting  of  registers,  records  or
         documents which may have a bearing on alleged  offences  under  the
         Act to a police official; and
     * to provide for matters connected therewith.

The Committee deliberated on the amendments and is happy as  amendments  are
addressing key areas that will improve work of the Services in the  area  of
communication. The  Amendment  Bill  is  currently  under  consideration  by
Cabinet with a view to have it fast tracked in  Parliament  during  the  3rd
session.

b.    Reports

Drawing from its functions the Committee obtains from:

i.    The Auditor-General  an  audit  report  compiled  in  accordance  with
     section 4(6) of the Auditor-General Act 12 of 1995.

The Committee has received and accepted the report of the  year  ended  31st
March 1999  from  the  Auditor-General.  The  Committee  has  since  engaged
National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and South African Secret  Service  (SASS)
on the issues that needed attention. Steps have been  taken  by  the  Agency
and the  Service  to  rectify  these  issues.  Most  of  the  problems  were
experienced during the process of  amalgamation  and  restructuring  of  the
Services.

ii.   The Evaluation Committee a report on the secret services and  intended
     secret services  evaluated  and  reviewed  by  it,  together  with  any
     comments or recommendations, which the Evaluation  Committee  may  deem
     appropriate.

The Evaluation Committee has not been established  as  yet  as  required  in
terms of the Secret Services Act. The  Committee  is  in  consultation  with
President's office to find out whether the President intends to set  up  the
committee or to propose amendment to the enabling legislation.

iii.A Report on the Interception and Monitoring Prohibition Act 127 of 1992

The Committee  met  with  Judge  Gordon,  who  is  responsible  for  issuing
directives under this Act. The judge gave  a  report  about  his  work.  The
Committee agreed together with the judge to regularise meetings between  the
committee and the judge to twice per year.

The following is a report submitted to the JSCI  on  applications  from  the
Intelligence Services and granting of permission thereof.

In this report it is reflected  that  no  applications  were  received  from
Defence Intelligence. This is  because  its  mandate  is  external  and  its
internal activities are limited to deployment by the  President  in  support
of the SAPS.

iv.   Each Minister to submit a report regarding the budget for the  Service
     for which he or she is responsible.

The Heads of Services have appeared before the Committee. The  Committee  is
satisfied with the reports and has endorsed them. However,  there  are  some
matters that still need to  be  concluded  with  the  Defence  Intelligence.
These matters hinge on personnel appointments and  the  related  vote.  This
matter will be concluded before the tabling of Defence  Intelligence  budget
to Parliament.

v.    Inspector-General's Reports and Certificates

The Committee has not received any report or certificate from the Office  of
the  Inspector  General  at  the  time  of  drafting  this  report  on   the
functioning of the Office of the Inspector General.

Section 4
JSCI Interaction with the Intelligence Services

The Committee  has  conducted  a  series  of  meetings  with  the  Services.
Concentration has  been  on  inquiries  on  budget,  financial  expenditure,
assets,  personnel   management,   transformation   and   intelligence   co-
ordination. The norm of regular  interaction  with  the  Services  has  been
established.

On our appointment, we made clear our  intentions  to  pursue  a  number  of
inquiries, among others were:


     * Probing issues of budget and financial expenditure as raised  by  the
         report of the Auditor-General.
     * The continuing risks posed by urban terrorism.
     * The arrangements for co-ordination between the Intelligence  Services
         and the law enforcement agencies in respect  of  serious  organized
         crime.

National Intelligence Co-ordinating Committee (NICOC)

Co-ordination of intelligence in the context of the South African  situation
continues to be a strategic, effective and efficient way  of  handling  both
intelligence within the Intelligence Community and between the  Intelligence
Community and its clients. It is  therefore  an  important  tool  under  the
circumstances especially considering the  geo-political  strategic  position
of our country.

NICOC reinforces the  work  of  the  Committee  because  of  its  geographic
distribution and location of its offices. It gives an integrated picture  of
the activities of the Services. However, the  committee  continues  to  have
concerns on the co-ordination  of  intelligence  at  Provincial  level.  The
report  received   from   NICOC   recently   nevertheless   indicates   some
improvements.

National Intelligence Agency (NIA)

The functions of the National Intelligence Agency, subject to Section  3  of
the Intelligence Act, are:


     1.      to  gather,   correlate,   evaluate,   and   analyse   domestic
         intelligence, in order to:-
     2.     to fulfil the national counter-intelligence responsibilities and
         for this purpose to conduct  and  co-ordinate  counter-intelligence
         and  to  gather,  correlate,  evaluate,   analyse   and   interpret
         information regarding counter-intelligence in order to: -
     3.      gather  departmental  intelligence  at  the  request   of   any
         interested department of State,  and  without  delay  evaluate  and
         transmit such  intelligence  and  any  other  intelligence  at  the
         disposal  of  the  Agency  and   which   constitutes   departmental
         intelligence, to the department concerned.

Observations and Recommendation

In our interaction with NIA, we observed that there are issues  that  needed
attention.  These  issues  are  from  the  report  of  the  Auditor-General,
performance and issues related to discipline.  The  issues  that  have  been
raised by the Auditor-General were discussed with the Agency and the  Agency
clarified  the  issues.  The  NIA  indicated  that  these  weaknesses   were
rectified. Despite all the bad publicity there is a lot  of  improvement  in
this area of administration.

The  Committee  closely  scrutinized  the  performance  of  NIA  on  service
delivery. Of particular importance was the vetting process. Delayed  vetting
reports may have negative impact on government departments, as  they  cannot
continue with appointments without clearance being made  on  candidates  for
the jobs. However, the Committee has noted that there is a problem  of  lack
of resources and capacity in the Agency.

The Committee  urges  the  National  Treasury  to  prioritise  provision  of
financial resources to the Agency to increase its capacity  to  perform  its
core  functions.  The  Committee  is  convinced  that   adequate   financial
resourcing of the Agency will bring about improvements in this regard.

South African Secret Services (SASS)

The Committee has had a  good  interaction  with  SASS.  There  is  a  sound
improvement  on  management  and   administration   matters.   Progress   on
transformation is also satisfactory. However, due to under funding that  the
Service is experiencing:


     * Representation abroad is not sufficient despite the fact that this is
         the Service's core function. This problem needs to be prioritised.
     * The Service cannot attract appropriate human  resource.  This  is  an
         impediment to the functioning of the Service.

It is the view of the  Committee  that  National  Treasury  must  prioritise
financial resource to the Service. Recently when the Department  of  Foreign
Affairs (DFA) had improvements in its budget for foreign offices,  SASS  was
not given similar financial allocations whilst the  National  Treasury  knew
very well that the impact of foreign exchange losses on  the  Rand  was  the
same on both departments.

Despite these problems, the Service has achieved much and the  Committee  is
convinced that with adequate funding more improvements will be realised.

South African National Defence Force - Defence Intelligence (DI)

The  National   Strategic   Intelligence   Act   establishes   the   Defence
Intelligence - a division of the South African National Defence  Force.  Its
mandate is to:


     * gather, correlate, evaluate and use  foreign  military  intelligence,
         and supply  foreign  military  intelligence  relating  to  national
         strategic intelligence to NICOC;
     * gather, correlate and use domestic  military  intelligence  excluding
         covert collection, except when employed for service referred to  in
         section 227(1)(e) of the Constitution and under conditions set  out
         in section 3 (2) of  the  Act,  and  supply  such  intelligence  to
         NICOC; and
     * institute counter-intelligence measures within the  National  Defence
         Force.

The Committee calls upon  the  National  Treasury  to  consider  having  the
Budget of the Defence Intelligence ring-fenced from the  general  budget  of
the Military. This Service  is  under  resourced  financially  resulting  in
inadequate  representation  abroad.  Offices  in  areas  that  warrant   our
presence have closed.

The integration process has been very slow. This is reflected by  imbalanced
representation of the South African demographics in the leadership  echelons
of the Service. This situation concerns the  Committee.  Regular  visits  to
Defence Intelligence to oversee this process are being planned.

As it has been indicated in our last report,  the  interaction  between  the
Committee and Defence Intelligence has been  poor.  During  the  year  under
review  the  Committee  notes  some  improvement  although  not  of  immense
significance.
South African Police Service - Crime Intelligence (CI)

The Constitution allows for the  establishment  of  the  Crime  Intelligence
Division of the South African Police Service for the sole purpose:


     * to gather, correlate, evaluate and use crime intelligence in  support
         of  the  functions  of  the  South  African   Police   Service   as
         contemplated in section 215 of the Constitution; and
     * to institute counter-intelligence measures within the  South  African
         Police Service.

In order  to  supply  crime  intelligence  relating  to  national  strategic
intelligence to NICOC.

Crime Intelligence is a new Intelligence Service in  our  country.  Progress
in developing this division  has  been  very  slow.  The  division  has  the
daunting  task  of  creating  capacity  within  crime  intelligence  through
changing the mindset and orientating its members towards the provision of  a
crime combating service.

Crime Intelligence has not been stable  ever  since  its  inception  due  to
ongoing structural and personnel changes.  The  Committee  is  engaging  the
Service on this issue including that of transformation  because  little  has
also been done in that area.

Most of the problems in Crime Intelligence  are  as  a  result  of  lack  of
financial resources. The Committee has accepted the  report  tabled  by  the
Service and is satisfied with plans.

Section 5
International Relations

1.    Africa

The Committee is participating in the Round Table discussions  on  oversight
function. In  Africa  the  consistent  participants  to  these  Round  Table
discussions are governments of Ghana, Nigeria  and  the  Republic  of  South
Africa. In Africa, South Africa is ahead of other countries  in  putting  in
place parliamentary oversight mechanisms.

2.    Rest of the World
The ability of the Committee to conduct its work  properly  depends  on  its
characteristics. The Committee undertook a number of  study  tours  to  gain
exposure so as to be able to  build  a  particular  characteristic.  Members
must know enough about intelligence to be able to do  the  job  effectively.
The interaction  with  the  other  Committees  has  helped  to  balance  the
knowledge  and  characteristics  of  the  Committee.  Coming  from   outside
intelligence, one may have suspicion of becoming part of the system. On  the
other hand learn details and what questions to ask and the  culture  of  the
Services he/she has to work with.

In Canada and the United States of America the Committee was  interested  in
the set-up and operations of the Offices of the  Inspectors-General  whereas
in Germany the focus  was  on  oversight  role  and  functions.  Comparative
oversight arrangements were discussed.

We were pleased to receive officials and parliamentarians interested in  the
field of oversight from Canada. These interactions exposed the Committee  to
a number international experiences and trends.
*Brig-General P Schalkwyk has since replaced Mr R Pillay.

Section 6
Budget

From February 2000 to March 2001, the Committee held thirty  five  meetings,
visited  the  Signal  Intelligence  department  at  Rietvlei  and  held  one
bosberaad. The Committee would like to raise its  concern  over  its  budget
allocation as it operates differently to other Committees of  Parliament  in
that no document may leave the office. This implies that  Committee  members
have to do all their  work  within  the  walls  of  the  JSCI  office.  This
requires provision of suitable working space and  infra-structural  support.
These are inadequately supplied at the  moment.  The  security  requirements
under which the Committee works require Committee members to spend  most  of
their time at the JSCI office.

The JSCI, unlike other Committees, cannot receive sponsorship  for  purposes
of undertaking study tours as this could undermine  national  security.  Its
budget therefore should not be treated the same way as the budget  of  other
Committees.

Section 7
Conclusion

It has become clear to the Committee that oversight is  likely  to  be  more
effective if the  relationship  between  the  Committee  and  the  Ministers
responsible for Intelligence Services  and  the  Office  of  the  Inspector-
General is strengthened. The Committee regrets poor interaction  experienced
in the past year with the Ministers and that the Office  of  the  Inspector-
General is not fully operational.

While the advent of the  JSCI  has  not  eradicated  Intelligence  Services'
problems, it has helped identify and remove many of them. The Committee  has
exposed  numerous  problems  and  recommended  solutions.  This  has  helped
Services to be more professional in executing their  duties.  The  Committee
has generally built up good reputation.

The reputation  for  good,  thorough  and  effective  oversight  has  had  a
deterrent effect on Members of the Services who might have been  tempted  to
go beyond the limits of the law.

The process for setting up the Services' priorities is well established  but
there is a need to provide adequate resources to meet  these  priorities  to
the best of their ability. It is important that the Services make  the  best
use of the technology at their disposal and improve on it by being  involved
in collaborative projects where appropriate. Efforts undertaken by  Services
to overcome their difficulties in the recruitment  is  encouraged.  However,
it is vitally important that they are  able  to  recruit  members  with  the
necessary language skills and specialisation. The Committee intends to  keep
this situation under review.

1.    Report of the Select Committee on Land and  Environmental  Affairs  on
     Study Tour to KwaZulu-Natal, dated 23 May 2001:


     The  Select  Committee  on  Land  and  Environmental  Affairs,   having
     undertaken a study tour to KwaZulu-Natal  on  29  and  30  March  2001,
     reports as follows:


     A.     Objective


         At a meeting on 27 February 2001 the Committee decided to go  on  a
         fact-finding  mission  to  KwaZulu-Natal.  The   purpose   was   to
         investigate steps taken to bring the  outbreaks  of  foot-and-mouth
         disease (FMD) and cholera in the province under control. They  also
         intended to find out how the outbreaks  had  affected  the  various
         role-players  and  what  steps  had  been  taken   to   prevent   a
         recurrence.


         The delegation members were Mrs J N Vilakazi, Ms B Thompson,  Ms  B
         N Dlulane  and  Mr  R  M  Nyakane,  accompanied  by  the  Committee
         Secretary, Mr K Williams.


     B.     29 March


         The   Committee   investigated   the   FMD    outbreak    in    the
         Pietermaritzburg-Camperdown region.


         1. Visit to Allerton Veterinary Laboratory, Pietermaritzburg


              Dr R F Horner, Deputy Director: Laboratory  Section,  Dr  D  I
              Mtshali, Deputy-Director: Animal Health, and Mr S Nxumalo  met
              the delegation. Dr A  S  Dludla,  Chief  Director:  Laboratory
              Section, joined them later.
              Dr Horner, assisted by Dr Mtshali, briefed the  delegation  on
              the outbreak of FMD in the region.


              He said that the Allerton Laboratory had been  the  operations
              centre  in  combating  the  outbreak.  Some  time  between  16
              September 2000 (first report of the outbreak)  and  Christmas,
              50 to 60 people had met in the  library  at  Allerton  to  co-
              ordinate the fight against FMD.


              At the time of the visit, they felt that they  had  eliminated
              FMD in the province. They could  restart  the  survey  of  all
              rural livestock in the province, which would  enable  them  to
              detect any recurrence.


              Dr Horner appealed to the  delegation  to  assist  in  getting
              money for the survey.


              He said that FMD was a disease of national importance. It  was
              particularly feared because of its ability to spread  rapidly,
              having no respect for boundaries. FMD  has  a  high  morbidity
              rate but a low mortality rate - most animals  in  an  affected
              region would be infected,  but  few  would  die  as  a  direct
              result. Although it did not make  humans  sick,  the  economic
              consequences of FMD were so severe that  people  had  to  take
              note of it.


              Symptoms of FMD include -


              *   blisters and erosions on the lips, snout, gums, palate and
                  tongue


              *   sudden lameness


              *   increased salivation


              *   fever


              *   loss of appetite


              *   a sudden drop in milk yield


              *   abortion


              *   a high mortality rate in young stock.


              FMD  viruses  belong  to  the  family  Picornaviridae,   which
              includes the human polio virus  and  the  Hepatitis  A  virus.
              There are seven distinct FMD viruses: Type A, Asia 1, C, O and
              SAT 1, 2 and  3.  The  SAT  viruses  affect  buffalo  and  are
              relatively common to South Africa.


              The outbreak in the  Camperdown  region  was  very  dangerous,
              because the Type O virus,  of  which  little  was  known,  had
              caused it.


              The disease is extremely  contagious  and  can  be  spread  by
              direct contact or by  inhalation.  The  movement  of  infected
              animals and contaminated people and  equipment  play  a  great
              role in spreading the disease. It can even spread through  the
              air.


              The O virus apparently came to Camperdown from the  Far  East,
              through Durban harbour. Illegal, contaminated swill was fed to
              pigs on a farm in the  region.  They  were  infected,  and  it
              spread to cattle.


              An investigation was instituted. Immediately  after  the  pigs
              became ill, it was investigated and  quarantine  notices  were
              served. At 17:30 on 15 September 2000, it was  confirmed  that
              there was an outbreak of FMD in the region. Veterinarians  set
              up headquarters at Allerton and appealed for  aid  from  other
              role-players.


              At first, they had huge logistical problems, as roadblocks had
              to be set up and diagnostic kits were needed in case personnel
              became  contaminated.  A  communication  system   (with   0800
              numbers) was set up for the public. Samples had to be sent  to
              Onderstepoort for analysis.


              On 17 September 2000, culling began.  During  the  next  three
              days, 677 pigs, six cattle,  five  sheep  and  14  goats  were
              killed. Four days of  rain,  however,  made  incineration  and
              burial difficult.


              On 20  September  2000,  they  saw  lesions  on  a  cow  on  a
              neighbouring farm, and FMD was confirmed the next day. A total
              of 53 cattle and 2 289 pigs were  culled  over  the  next  few
              days.


              Sixteen magisterial districts were declared FMD  areas.  After
              the topography and weather of the region were analysed, it was
              decided to cull all stock within a  three  km  radius  of  the
              outbreak. Notices were served on 13 farms, and by 30 September
              2000, all the animals were culled and  buried.  Holding  camps
              were built for stray animals.


              On 10 October 2000 FMD was discovered in a small  kraal  north
              of the N3. Within 26 hours, 15  cattle  and  four  goats  were
              culled and buried. A five km  fence  was  erected  to  prevent
              movement into the infected area. Surveillance was intensified.


              On 23 October 2000, they discovered lesions on  37  cattle  in
              the Mpumalanga/Sankonshe area. It was difficult to cull  these
              animals, because of resistance from the community. They had to
              set up meetings with local and provincial leaders as  well  as
              the national Minister.


              Eventually  communal  animals  were  brought  forward,   after
              instituting an "instant valuation or  replacement  programme".
              From 30 October to 8 November 2000, 982 cattle,  1  102  pigs,
              122 sheep and 814 goats were destroyed.


              On 8 November 2000 they  discovered  another  case  in  a  new
              communal area,  and  reluctantly  decided  to  vaccinate.  The
              vaccination programme started on 20 November 2000.  Cattle  at
              the last dip tanks were vaccinated in early February 2001.


              The reasons for the late decision to  vaccinate  included  the
              following. The ease of  spread  large  number  of  hosts  make
              vaccination alone a  simplistic  approach.  Different  strains
              need strain-specific vaccine. Immunity only lasts for a  short
              while, and revaccination must occur two or three times a year.




              It is not possible to vaccinate all animals.  And  what  about
              game? Some vaccinated  animals  become  carriers.  Vaccination
              teams  could  spread  the  virus.  There  is   resistance   to
              vaccination in the communal areas.


              For all these reasons, it is better to stamp out  the  disease
              than to vaccinate against it.


              On vaccine research, the delegation was told  that  the  money
              available for animal health research was very limited and that
              there was a need for faster-  acting  vaccines  with  multiple
              sero types.


              The conclusions from the FMD outbreak in the Camperdown region
              were that they needed the following to combat outbreaks:


              *   rapid decisions


              *   support and co-operation from all farmers


              *   rapid culling and disposal of infected animals


              *   control of the movement of animals and people


              *   support from "sister" organisations such as the  SAPS  and
                  the SANDF


              *   constant communication and media liaison


              *   stamina.


              In response to questions from delegation  members,  Dr  Horner
              said that initially the  provincial  government  had  made  R1
              million available to combat the outbreak.  After  that,  money
              from the national government was used.


              Little money was available for animal health research  because
              people tended to regard it as an unimportant field,  at  least
              until outbreaks like this one. Perhaps the disaster would have
              the positive spin-off that more money would be made  available
              for animal health research. The laboratory  also  needed  more
              funds to complete its survey of rural livestock.


              It was not possible to stamp out the SAT variety of FMD (found
              in buffalo), but it can be controlled. The exotic Type  O  FMD
              (in the Camperdown region) had been eliminated completely.


              One cannot stop the movement of contaminated people  entirely,
              but this is only a secondary way in  which  the  infection  is
              spread. Two thirds of infection occurs as a result of  feeding
              animals with illegal swill that has not been boiled for up  to
              one hour, as the law requires.


              The outbreak  in  the  Mpumalanga  district  was  of  the  SAT
              variety. It is now under control - all vulnerable animals have
              been vaccinated twice  and  all  infected  animals  have  been
              culled.


              Direct  costs  of  combating  the  outbreak  amounted  to  R25
              million, R5 million being used to replace  culled  animals  or
              compensate their owners at market value.


              There was much resistance in the Sankonshe area, and therefore
              culling could not take place immediately. The MEC and Minister
              had to be  called  in  to  explain  to  people  why  this  was
              necessary. There were also huge interventions in the  form  of
              airdrops and sky-shouts. At the time of writing, the education
              process was still under way.


         2. Field visit to Sankonshe district


              After a briefing at  the  laboratory,  the  Committee  visited
              local headman, Induna Mkhize.  He  was  with  other  community
              members whose stock had been affected by the outbreak.


              They complained that  their  stock  was  collected  as  strays
              during the quarantine period, simply because nobody seemed  to
              be herding them. Some of the animals died of causes other than
              FMD, and the community was thus not compensated, which  caused
              much bitterness.


              Community members related how some cattle died  after  showing
              signs of the disease. Many cattle were affected, as  they  had
              been grazing in groups. They described how  testing  was  done
              and how the affected animals were placed  aside  for  culling.
              They resisted this, but after  Minister  Didiza  assured  them
              that only infected animals would be killed, they  agreed  that
              culling could go ahead.


              They related that, on the following  day,  many  officials  on
              horseback, in cars and on cycles rounded up all their  cattle,
              which were then slaughtered by grim-faced soldiers. Dr Mtshali
              explained that the community  had  not  been  made  distinctly
              aware of the fact that all animals within a 10 km radius of an
              outbreak were deemed to have been infected. This oversight had
              caused a great deal of misunderstanding in the community,  and
              education efforts on this are still carrying on.


              The embittered community said that the traumatic sight of  the
              soldiers would not be forgotten  easily.  They  had,  however,
              accepted that they had been struck by  a  disaster,  and  were
              thankful for the compensation  that  they  received  from  the
              government.


              The community wished that more dip  tanks  be  constructed  in
              their area,  and  requested  the  Committee  to  find  cheaper
              animals for them to buy, as  the  cost  of  a  beast  normally
              exceeded the R2 500 they had received as compensation.


              Dr Mtshali explained that it costs between R16 000 and R60 000
              to renovate a dip tank. The tanks play  an  important  role  -
              communal farmers are keen to have their animals  dipped.  This
              allows for interaction with them and for inspection  of  their
              livestock. It is a very important control measure against FMD.


         3. Recommendations


              The Committee recommends that more money be made available  to
              build and renovate dip tanks. It  was  pointed  out  that  the
              Director-General: Agriculture, in a briefing to the  Committee
              on 28 March 2001, undertook to do this.


              The Committee further  recommends  that  more  funds  be  made
              available for animal health research, and that the  survey  of
              rural  livestock  undertaken  by   the   Allerton   Provincial
              Veterinary Laboratory be supported financially.


              Despite  the  harshness  of  the  Department's  approach,  the
              Committee also recommends that the Department  of  Agriculture
              and Land Affairs  should  be  praised  for  their  efforts  in
              stamping out the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak.


     C.     30 March 2001


         The delegation went to the  Empangeni  region  to  investigate  the
         cholera outbreak.
         1. Visit to Ngwelezane Hospital in Empangeni


              The  delegation  was  met   by   Dr   Wanguhu,   the   Medical
              Superintendent, Matron Ngomezulu and Matron Mkonza. Mr T  R  C
              Munguni of the Department of Water Affairs  and  Forestry  was
              also present. These four formed part of the  Joint  Operations
              Committee (JOC) that was set up at the height of the outbreak,
              and they briefed the Committee on the history of the  outbreak
              and steps taken to control it.


              (a) Briefing on cholera outbreak


                  Members of JOC pointed out that the outbreak  had  largely
                  been brought under control. There were at that stage  only
                  30 cholera patients in the hospital, one of  whom  was  in
                  the intensive care unit. Only one rehydration station  was
                  still in operation.


                  (i)  Summary of development of outbreak


                       The Committee was told that, in  August  2000,  there
                       was a sudden increase in the number of patients  with
                       diarrhoea. A cholera outbreak was confirmed  and  the
                       hospital staff could not  cope  with  the  situation.
                       They decided to seek  help  from  the  Department  of
                       Water Affairs and Forestry, and JOC was set  up.  The
                       emphasis  shifted  to  providing  clean   water   and
                       sanitation, and the Department put up water tanks  in
                       the countryside.


                       On the medical front, the tuberculosis (TB) ward  was
                       used to treat cholera patients, and rehydration tents
                       were set up all over  the  region.  At  these  tents,
                       patients were assessed, treated  and  educated  about
                       the disease.  Serious  cases  were  referred  to  the
                       hospital. The extent of the infection  fluctuated  in
                       the following months, and reached a high  again  over
                       the Christmas period, because of the tendency of  the
                       disease to spread easily at big  gatherings.  At  the
                       time of writing, the situation was under control, but
                       as these outbreaks occur in five-year cycles,  it  is
                       expected to happen again. No outbreak was anticipated
                       over Easter, however,  because  of  the  preventative
                       steps taken by the Department.


                  (ii) Preventative steps by Department


                       The main problem has been identified as one of  water
                       and sanitation. However, while  local  government  is
                       involved in the provision of safe water and  toilets,
                       the lifestyle  in  rural  areas  cannot  be  ignored.
                       Education is needed about the proper use of  toilets,
                       and the Church is playing a role here.


                       The Department provides mobile toilets for all  large
                       gatherings, and a strategy for  sanitation  has  been
                       worked out. "Ash loos" are now  being  built  with  a
                       R600 subsidy from the government, with the  community
                       providing the manpower.


                       The Department erected 25-litre tanks of clean  water
                       in the vulnerable areas and all containers have to be
                       "jikked" (cleaned thoroughly) before they are used to
                       carry water. They are also working  on  a  system  of
                       piped water.


                       The  Department  receives  help  from  NGOs  and  the
                       private sector in its efforts  to  take  preventative
                       steps against the disease. Mondi donated the 25-litre
                       tanks for safe water,  Tungro  donated  a  Jik-making
                       machine, Nampak donated containers for the  Jik,  and
                       Dorcas Aid helped with  purification  of  water  from
                       streams.


              (b) Wards for cholera patients


                  After the briefing, the  delegation  visited  the  cholera
                  and rehydration wards. Both  were  relatively  empty,  but
                  the patients were heartened by the visit.  The  delegation
                  was told that, at the height of the epidemic, beds had  to
                  be pushed together, with two patients sharing three  beds,
                  in an effort to accommodate  all  the  patients.  Patients
                  told  how  they  had  contracted  the  disease  by  eating
                  contaminated   fruit   and    vegetables    or    drinking
                  contaminated water.


         2. Field visit to cholera-affected areas  (Nqutshini,  Madlebe  and
              Nseleni)


              On a field visit to the affected areas, the members could  see
              for themselves how the 25-litre green plastic  tanks  and  the
              "ash loos" dotted the landscape. This was  clear  evidence  of
              the preventative steps the Department  had  taken.  Also,  the
              entire Madlebe region is being provided with piped tap  water,
              which comes from the Madlebe Water Scheme, inaugurated  on  19
              March  2001.  Water  is  piped  from  the  main  reservoir  in
              Empangeni to satellite reservoirs in  the  Madlebe  area.  The
              satellite reservoirs were constructed with  community  labour.
              The water is then  piped  from  the  satellite  reservoirs  to
              strategic points. The water costs R20 per household per month.


              Nseleni Township, with its  informal  settlement  of  Ovondlo,
              painted a different picture. Because  of  poor  sanitation  in
              this informal settlement, there had been a severe outbreak  in
              this area. At the time of the outbreak, congestion and lack of
              roads  made  it  impossible  for  the  Department  to  deliver
              services. There was simply no place for the  "ash  loos",  and
              when the 25-litre tanks were set up, members of township  came
              to the informal settlement for "free" water.  Congestion  also
              makes it difficult to pipe water into the area.


         3. Recommendations


              Members said thank you to the team at Ngwelezane  Hospital  as
              well as the Department for  the  sterling  work  they  did  to
              combat the epidemic.  They  were  the  unsung  heroes  of  our
              country and deserved to be congratulated.


              Further,  the  Committee  recommends   that   the   government
              accelerate  its  efforts  to  rid  the  country  of   informal
              settlements.


     D.     Conclusion


         The Committee regards the visit as a  success,  as  the  delegation
         met most of its objectives. However, time constraints prevented  it
         from completing some parts of the programme (like the visit to  the
         rehabilitated dip tanks).


         The Committee was also of the opinion that note should be taken  of
         the misunderstanding that arose, in the  case  of  both  outbreaks,
         between Western-trained specialists and  ordinary  African  people.
         It cited the case of peasants refusing to use toilets as  this  was
         not a traditional  practice.  It  considered  that  the  aspect  of
         education in these instances should be further stressed.
