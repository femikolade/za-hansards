                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr P M MATHEBE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that President Mbeki took Great Britain by storm during his
         successful visit ...

[Interjections.]


  (2) commends President Mbeki for building on our historic relationship
         with Britain and for taking dozens of business people with him;


  (3) further commends Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Queen and the British
         people for the hospitable manner in which they received our
         President; and

         United Kingdom.

[Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) commits itself once again to the principle that violence against
         women, whether in private or in public, is unacceptable ...

[Interjections.]


  (2) notes the incident on Youth Day when the President pushed the hon
         Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in the face and knocked her cap off,
         which was humiliating not only for her but also for those millions
         of South Africans who have respect for women of whatever age.

[Interjections.]


   (3)      calls upon the President to apologise publicly for his bad
        manners and unfortunate conduct.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the police that have been honoured by the KwaZulu-Natal
         MEC and his commissioner for bravery and good behaviour at their
         work;


  (2) encourages all policemen and policewomen to follow suit in order for
         them to be respected by the community in which they reside; and


  (3) thanks the MEC, the hon Inkosi N J Ngubane, MPP, for his
         encouragement and his provincial commissioner, Mr Moses Khanyile,
         for looking after the interest and the welfare of the police in
         the province of KwaZulu-Natal by bestowing such an honour on them
         to promote diligence in their performance.

Ms M A MOLEBATSI: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the cold-blooded murder of Comrade Frans George Ramole on the
         evening of 16 June 2001;


  (2) further notes that at the time of his murder he was serving as the
         chairperson of the safety and security unit of the Tshwane mayoral
         committee;
  (3) conveys its sincere condolences to the bereaved family; and


  (4) calls for the tracking down of the murderers and appeals to the
         community to assist the police with information.

[Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  since 1990 tax contributions by individuals have climbed from
           30% to 41% of tax receipts;


       (b)  this is a shocking indication of how the ANC Government burdens
           the SA taxpayer, which is in direct contravention of
           international tax trends; and


       (c)  the ANC are adding yet another two tax laws to the present
           unacceptably high tax burden of South Africans; and


  (2) calls on the Government to put a moratorium on all new taxes till it
         can prove to the SA taxpayers that they are getting value for
         their money and that it is not simply making more instant
         multimillionaires, like Coleman Andrews, with the hard-earned
         money of SA taxpayers.

[Applause.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that Spoornet is a nonroad user of bulk diesel fuel, and that
           its use of this fuel is being further restricted to low density
           lines due to the electrification of the Kimberley-De Aar stretch
           of the Johannesburg-Cape Town line;


       (b)  that, in the 1999-2000 financial year, Spoornet's levies to the
           Road Accident Fund and the SA National Roads Agency through its
           bulk diesel purchases amounted to almost R29 million; and


       (c)  the destruction wrought on our roads network due to the high
           axle loads permitted and overloading even under these
           circumstances; and


  (2) calls on the Minister to apply to Spoornet the same rebates that are
       granted to other nonroad users of bulk diesel, eg the fishing and
       shipping industries.

Mr K W MORWAMOCHE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that DA leader Tony Leon has at long last had the courage to
           admit publicly that his party is dominated by white males and
           that it has to attract more black people; and


       (b)  Mr Leon's late admission that the ANC had brought freedom to all
           South Africans, including Mr Leon;


  (2) believes Mr Leon should realise that no matter how many token blacks
       join the DA, all South Africans know that the ANC is the only party
       that can bring a better life for all; and


  (3) calls on all patriots to join the ANC, as it is the only organisation
       committed to fundamental transformation in our country.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that -


       (a)  two SBV security guards were killed during Monday's cash-in-
           transit heist near the Morula Sun Casino in Mabopane, north of
           Pretoria, and that a third guard was seriously injured while
           they were on their way to Mabopane to fill automated teller
           machines; and


       (b)  the robbers, who got away with millions of rands, crashed their
           vehicle head-on into the SBV van and used an axe to hack open
           the top of the vehicle to access the cash;


     (2)    further notes that armed robberies are becoming more ruthless by
         the day and that the lives of persons in the security services are
         at risk, and are not valued by mindless criminals who are intent
         on sowing mayhem and destruction in our country; and


     (3)    calls on the Minister of Safety and Security and the police to
         take drastic and immediate action against armed robbers, and to
         send a very clear message that organised criminals will be
         apprehended, tried, convicted and severely punished.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die AEB sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) sy misnoeë uitspreek oor die voorneme van minister Kader Asmal om die
       name van skole wat die naam dra van bekende Afrikanerleiers van die
       verlede te laat verander;


  (2) erken dat sodanige eensydige naamsveranderinge 'n bepaalde deel van
       die bevolking net verder sal vervreem, met nadelige gevolge vir die
       land as geheel en die onderwys in die besonder;


  (3) besef dat die finansiële implikasies vir die ouers in ag geneem moet
       word;
  (4) die uitspraak van die Minister dat minderhede se regte in wese die
       goedgesindheid van die meerderheid is wat nie misbruik moet word nie,
       strydig is met die gees van 'n onderhandelde skikking en die Grondwet
       van Suid-Afrika;


  (5) kennis neem van die feit dat Afrikaners nooit hul mag misbruik het om
       name uit die koloniale verlede, soos Milnerton High, Grey Kollege en
       Port Shepstone High, te verander nie; en


  (6) 'n beroep op die Minister doen om hierdie kulturele imperialisme te
       laat vaar en te fokus op die basiese taak van kwaliteit onderwys.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the AEB:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its displeasure at Minister Kader Asmal's intention to
       change the names of schools that are named after well-known Afrikaner
       leaders of the past;
  (2) concedes that such a unilateral changing of names will only estrange
       one specific population group even further, with negative
       consequences for the country as a whole and education in particular;


  (3) realises that financial implications for the parents should be taken
       into account;


  (5) concedes that the Minister's remark that minority rights are, in
       essence, generated by the goodwill of the majority, which should not
       be abused, is contrary to the spirit of a negotiated settlement and
       the Constitution of South Africa;


  (6) notes that Afrikaners never abused their power to change names from
       the colonial past, such as Milnerton High, Grey College and Port
       Shepstone High; and


  (7) appeals to the Minister to abandon this cultural imperialism and to
       focus on the basic task of quality education.]

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the DA-dominated Cape Town unicity has distinguished
       itself by running the city in favour of the rich and to the detriment
       of the poor ...

[Laughter.]


  (2) believes that Mr Marais has developed a reputation for ignoring the
       wishes of those who do not form the DA's traditional support base,
       particularly when they protest against his across-the-board rates
       increases;


  (3) commends the 40 civic organisations that have formed a broad alliance
       with the intention of taking Mr Marais to court; and


  (4) urges them not to stop until Mr Marais has come to his senses, ceases
       to behave like a dictator, and starts respecting the wishes of all
       the people and not only that of the privileged few.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr R J HEINE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the disagreements between Ministers Radebe and Erwin about the
       Coleman Andrews paypacket, and the statement by Mr Saki Macozoma to
       the effect that the President approved the payment to Mr Andrews;


  (2) enquiries of the Government which version of the truth is to be
       believed by the House and by the public of South Africa; and


  (3) calls upon the President to make a statement on the matter.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Dr O BALOYI: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House-


  (1) regrets the incident in which two guards were killed on Monday in a
       cash-in-transit heist, in which millions of rands were taken by armed
       robbers who used an axe to break the SBV vehicle;


  (2) further regrets that 402 guards have been killed in the past four
       years due to these robberies and R256 million have been lost by the
       cash-in-transit industry over the same period; and


  (3) calls upon the Department of Safety and Security to leave no stone
       unturned in bringing the perpetrators to book.

Mr Z KOTWAL: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Gateway, a financing scheme established to make it easier
       for poor employed people to obtain housing loans, has failed because
       major South African banks were hesitant to finance the lower end of
       the market;


  (2) elieves that all South Africans have a right to aspire to owning
       their own homes, even if they earn less than R3 500 per month, and
       therefore condemns those banks who do not share this view; and


  (3) calls on the Minister of Housing, Sankie Mthembi-Mahanyele, and the
       National Housing Corporation to develop a new financial model that
       will make housing accessible to all.

[Applause.]

Adv A H GAUM: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee kennis dat ek op die volgende
sittingsdag sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem van -
       (a)  die eensydige en stormram-optrede van kommissaris Jackie Selebi,
           wat daartoe gelei het dat kaptein Johan Colyn van sy
           speurderspligte onthef is en na die lykshuis op Brits verskuif
           is; en


       (b)  die bewering dat Selebi met behulp van 'n afluisterapparaat na
           gesprekke tussen James Nkambule en verdagtes geluister het, en
           dat, indien hy sonder 'n regter se toestemming aan sodanige
           afluistering deelgeneem het, hy aan 'n misdryf skuldig is
           waarvoor tot twee jaar gevangenisstraf opgelê kan word; en


  (2) 'n beroep doen op Selebi om hom te bepaal by sy taak om die SAPD
       behoorlik te bestuur deur onder andere te fokus op die uitskakeling
       van die grootskaalse personeel- en ander tekorte, en om op te hou om
       op outoritêre wyse selektief in sekere ondersoeke in te gryp wat hom,
       en die SAPD, in knaende kontroverse dompel.

[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Adv A H GAUM: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day I
shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note of -


       (a)  the unilateral and battering-ram reaction of Commissioner Jackie
           Selebi, which led to Captain Johan Colyn being discharged from
           his detective duties and transferred to the mortuary in Brits;
           and


       (b)  the allegation that Selebi, with the aid of a monitoring device,
           listened to conversations between James Nkambule and suspects,
           and that, if he did participate in such bugging without the
           permission of a judge, he is guilty of a crime for which he
           could receive a two year prison sentence; and


  (2) appeals to Selebi to confine himself to his task of managing the SAPS
       properly by, inter alia, focusing on the elimination of the large-
       scale staff shortages and other deficiencies, and to refrain from
       selectively intervening in certain investigations in an autocratic
       manner, thereby plunging himself and the SAPS into constant
       controversy.

[Interjections.]]

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the horrific fire over the past weekend which claimed the lives
       of five people at the historic, yet dilapidated, old Drill Hall in
       Doornfontein, Johannesburg;


  (2) further notes the unsympathetic manner in which the police, metro
       council and Department of Public Works passed the buck, avoiding
       responsibility for securing the building;


  (3) calls upon the Government to urgently house those who have become
       homeless as a result of this fire; and
  (4) further calls upon the Ministers of Public Works, of Arts, Culture,
       Science and Technology, and of Housing to effectively devise a
       comprehensive plan to house homeless people and to protect buildings
       of national historic importance.

Mrs M S MAINE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the National Development Agency has called in a forensic
       accounting firm to investigate several contracts to verify that the
       necessary procedures were followed, and that no irregularities took
       place;


  (2) acknowledges that the NDA, which distributes money from Government
       and donor organisations to development projects, has been tarnished
       by reports of improper procedures and practices;


  (3) believes that the NDA did the right thing in calling in a forensic
       accounting firm, because it is essential that the cloud hanging over
       the agency be removed if confidence in it is to be restored; and


  (4) calls on the NDA to ensure that those who are found not to have
       followed correct procedures are prosecuted.

[Applause.]

                              COMRADES MARATHON

         South African sporting calendar;


     (2)    recognises that in recent years this event has been won by
         runners from other countries; and


     (3)    congratulates Andrew Kelehe on bringing the title back home to
         South Africa by winning the Comrades Marathon, which will serve as
         an inspiration to all South Africans.

Agreed to.

                      CONGRATULATIONS TO RETIEF GOOSEN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:
  That the House -


     (1)    congratulates golfer Retief Goosen on becoming only the third
         South African to win the US Open; and


     (2)    welcomes his achievement for the recognition it brings to our
         country and for the inspiration it provides to young South African
         golfers.

Agreed to.

                       PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI'S BIRTHDAY
                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that yesterday was the 59th birthday of President Thabo Mbeki;


  (2) further notes that the President has made an important contribution
       to national unity, democracy and development in our country; and


  (3) congratulates President Mbeki on this occasion and wishes him health
       and strength in fulfilling his role as the leader of our nation.

Agreed to.

                       ORDER OF PRECEDENCE: QUESTIONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That, notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 29(8), Questions shall not

Agreed to.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 20 - Defence:

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, hon members of the National
Assembly, invited guests, may I start off by acknowledging amongst the
visitors this morning 2nd Lt Macauley, who is the first black woman pilot
of the SA National Defence Force. [Applause.]

The end of the Cold War and a subsequent changing world situation have
imposed constraints on all defence forces worldwide. The absence of a
direct military challenge allows countries to focus on economic, rather
than military, growth and expenditure. In this context, the disparity
between the rich and developed North and the poor and underdeveloped South
looms large.

Conflict on our continent is derived from the legacy of colonialism and the
Cold War, wherein corrupt governments were supported for the economic
benefit of the North. It is also the result of an unequal access to
resources. Conflict must be eliminated if we are to stabilise, develop and
move towards prosperity. But the resolution of conflict in underdeveloped
regions must be initiated and led by the nations affected with, of course,
the support of the North. It is against this backdrop that South Africa's
defence expenditure must be understood.

The principal responsibility of the Department of Defence is to protect
South Africa's sovereignty and to safeguard her territorial integrity
effectively and efficiently. Today we understand South Africa's security to
incorporate political, economic, social and environmental matters.
Therefore, conflict beyond our borders potentially impacts on our security.
To defend South Africa and protect her territorial integrity, we must
maintain our core capabilities, which are long-term, both in acquisition
and payment. Security, however, in its broader sense of socioeconomic
imperatives, is more immediate. My Deputy Minister will be addressing some
aspects of transformation, legislation and other challenges posed by HIV
and other problems.

The responsibility facing the Department of Defence is to maintain a core
force that is able to meet its commitments to deal with a wide range of
contingencies. Such a core force must have the capacity to expand to an
appropriate size when necessary. External military threats, internal
threats to the constitutional order, the promotion of regional security
through defence co-operation within the SADC framework, and the promotion
of international security through participation in peace operations and
military co-operation in support of our foreign policy goals, are among the
contingencies we must prepare for.

At present we are contributing military capacity for regional and
international peace support operations. The fluidity of the regional
environment increases the likelihood of an escalation in peace support
demands on South Africa. As the representative of a country committed to
stability, democracy, and good governance, the SANDF must be in a position
to fulfil its obligations when called upon to intervene.

We continue to allocate resources to a number of other secondary functions.
For instance, our support for the police continues. This year alone it has
involved 3 580 men and women from the SANDF and has cost us more than R109
million. We are hoping that the creation of a rapid deployment stability
force by the SA Police Service will release increasing numbers of members
of the SANDF from some day-to-day involvement with police functions.

The SANDF also supports a number of other departments, and has provided a
range of excellent services. The SANDF's response to a number of
emergencies has justifiably been praised everywhere. Domestically, and in
the recent past, these services have ranged from active involvement in
fighting the cholera epidemic and foot-and-mouth disease to assisting with
the flood relief, repairing damaged infrastructure after tornadoes and
heavy rains, building temporary bridges and fire fighting.

We are also involved in safeguarding our marine coastal resources. The
SANDF assisted with the securing of local government elections and four
other major events of national and international importance during the past
year. Again, this year the SANDF deployed 106 air force members for flood
relief in Mozambique. Clearly, a significant portion of our budget goes
towards providing these services.

The second challenge facing the department is aligning our policies, as set
out in the White Paper and the Defence Review, with our budget. I want to
quote from the White Paper where it says:


  Defence policy should be in harmony with all other aspects of Government
  policy, particularly foreign policy and national security policy.

The Defence Review was, in effect, a business plan for the implementation
of the White Paper. That White Paper dictated that we change from an
offensive to a defensive military posture, and I am glad to report that we
have now attained that objective.

However, because of increased and increasing regional, continental and
international demands being made on our country, we must take the process
further. Whilst the Defence Review remains appropriate in the wider sense,
the time may have come for some adjustments to be made. To that end, we are
conducting a military strategic appreciation of our capabilities, in order
to assess the extent to which we are currently able to carry out our
constitutional responsibilities and implement strategic decisions.

This, if I may say so, will probably require the mere reprioritisation of
activities and capabilities in consultation with Parliament. I have
observed that there has been some sense in that some felt that we may well
have veered away from the Defence Review, without consulting Parliament.
May I say that it is impossible for the department to do so without
consulting and getting a fresh mandate from Parliament. We will be
reporting to Parliament, through the defence committees, on the outcome of
this process of military strategic appreciation.

With regard to new technologies that are at the heart of the strategic
defence packages, technical training has to be adjusted and upgraded. We
remain committed to the strategic packages. We are pleased to report that
the contracts are on track. The first leg of the process is nearly
completed and the defence industrial participation programmes are going
well.

We need to state very clearly that the strategic packages remain valid,
because they provide the equipment we need for both our core business and
our secondary obligations. I welcome the debate on the strategic packages.
For the first time in our history, the acquisition of armaments has been
carried out in a transparent fashion. South African citizens can and must
scrutinise the performance of the executive. This is unprecedented in our
history.

Let me remind members that the establishment and maintenance of a balanced
VIP air transport capability was approved during the 2000-01 financial
year. I can report now that we have proceeded to fulfil our task of
maintaining that capability by ordering a further VIP transport aircraft,
the details of which have been made known to the House via the committees.

We live in a fast-changing world and the department must adapt to the
changing regional situation. For that change to be positive, we must all
turn the soil so that the Millennium Action Plan can take root. In her
budget address, the Minister of Foreign Affairs identified the challenges
and priorities facing Africa and South Africa and cited partnerships at
various levels as crucial to the successful implementation of the plan. In
the areas of collective regional peace and stability, it is incumbent on
defence to forge such partnerships.

Therefore, we have been involved in a number of exercises. Allow me to cite
a few examples of where we have been hard at work on this score. We have
the task of convening Ministers of Defence from Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe
and the Democratic Republic of Congo to develop strategies of disarming the
armed groups in accordance with the Lusaka Ceasefire and Standstill
Agreement. This project is now awaiting the completion of deployment of
phase 2 of Monuc.

Secondly, South Africa, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, and Belgium have been
invited to prepare for the securing of the peace process in Burundi. Once
again, we have recommended to the President that South Africa accept the
invitation and play a part in this process. We have already scheduled the
first meeting, which will cover contingency planning in this regard.

With regard to SADC, as a community of nations, I would like to remind the
House that SADC adopted the Protocol on Politics, Defence and Security Co-
operation, which is an agreement at political level on how to deal with
major conflicts which destabilise or may destabilise our region in the
future. The ratification of the Protocol, which defines the work of the
Organ on Politics, Defence and Security by the Heads of State, will mark an
important milestone in the achievement of regional security and confidence-
building measures.

Flowing directly from the Protocol is the need for a comprehensive

regional pact, the drafting of which started immediately after the 22nd
session of the Interstate Defence and Security Committee, which was held in
Maseru last month. It is intended, at this stage, that the collective
defence pact must deal with the issues of conflicts between SADC states and
states outside of SADC, between SADC states themselves where interstate
tension may arise between signatories as well as intrastate conflicts. This
pact must serve before the next summit of Heads of State in August. The
pact will provide a modus operandi of how to intervene in conflict
situations and prescribe proportional contributions to be made by every
member state. No country can, single-handedly, shoulder the responsibility
for the security of the region.

Members will appreciate that all of the activities mentioned above require
capacity. To qualitatively increase the capacity of the Defence Secretariat
is, therefore, our fifth challenge. The secretariat remains the Minister's
resource base for his civil oversight role. The internal audit committee I
set up last year has made three reports thus far, focusing on four areas of
weakness. These are being attended to as a matter of urgency.

It is, unfortunately, my duty to report to hon members that crime entailing
financial loss to the state has been uncovered within the department. We
take this very seriously at all senior levels of the department. We have
uncovered syndicates operating within some of our bases. The chief
financial officer, under the direction of the secretary, is setting up
internal control mechanisms. A holistic approach that includes the military
police and the inspector-general will be used. This approach will include
professionalising the audit function and supplementing it with an external
forensic capacity.

With regard to the curbing of losses and effecting improvements in our
efficiency, I have directed the chief executive officer of Armscor to
conduct an investigation into a more cost-effective utilisation of Simon's
Town Naval Dockyard. It is expected that the workgroup doing the
investigation will present a range of viable models to me by the end of the
year.

With regard to problems of transition, I wish to advise the House that the
final report of the ministerial inquiry is being edited at this stage. I
hope to be able to share its findings with Cabinet as well as the House
before Parliament rises. In the meantime, I wish to inform the House that
following the interim report, the Defence Staff Council looked at ways of
addressing the problems which were identified earlier on. The situation is
at present relatively stable. Nevertheless, further efforts need to be made
to overcome these problems.

Ensuring constant access to high-quality personnel is a challenge for any
defence force. For us, in South Africa, this challenge also provides us
with an opportunity to empower some of the best and brightest of our young
people with the skills and disciplines they will require throughout their
lives. Consequently, we are recommending to the country the introduction of
a service system.

The service system will form the first career stage for young, preferably
under 22, Grade 12 school-leavers to serve in the SA National Defence Force
on a voluntary basis for two years. It is proposed that during their first
year of service they will undergo basic military training, and some
functional training to prepare them for civilianisation later on if they
choose not to be members of the National Defence Force on a permanent
basis. Nevertheless, those who choose not to follow a military career will
be encouraged to serve in the reserve force.

This will enable the SA National Defence Force to retain the necessary
average age and best physical capacity among the bulk of the members of the
National Defence Force. These young people, in turn, will receive training
that is beneficial to them in their own private capacities. We aim to have
an annual intake of 10 000 young people.

Finally, I would like to extend my thanks to the Defence Secretary, Mr
January Masilela, who is accounting officer and head of department, and to
the Defence Secretariat as a whole. I would like to thank the Chief of the
SA National Defence Force, Gen Siphiwe Nyanda, the four chiefs of the
services and the SA National Defence Force as a whole, for the tremendous
job they have done this year.

I would like to recognise the men and women in the military bases around
the country, and our teams in the DRC, Eritrea and Ethiopia. They serve as
symbols of courage, discipline and dedication, and our Government and
people are proud of their sterling efforts. [Applause.]

My thanks go to Armscor, our acquisition agency. I would also like to thank
the British Military Advisory Training Team headed now by Brig Hughes. I
repeat, once again, my gratitude to Brig Killin, who has since left. Thanks
are also due to the Civic Education Monitoring and Advisory Committee and
all those who have participated in working with the department, from NGOs
and universities.

I would also like to thank Dr Setai, Gen Geldenhuys, Col Mbongwa and Ms
Lamani, who are working to complete the final report of the inquiry. My
thanks to Roy Anderson and Admiral Bekker who have headed the independent
audit committee. I also thank Roeland Hudson Bennett and the Castle Control
Board for their open-mindedness and participation in helping to map the way
forward for the Castle.

I thank the team at the Ministry and, most importantly in this forum, allow
me to thank the three chairs of the parliamentary committees. Lastly, my
gratitude to my family who have allowed me to continue to serve in this
capacity. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Before calling on the next speaker, I wish to
acknowledge the presence in the gallery of the former Deputy Speaker of the
National Assembly, Dr Ranchod. We hope you will visit us more frequently Dr
Ranchod. [Applause.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Madam Speaker, the increase of R2,086 billion in the
Defence Budget for the financial year 2001-02, results in a substantial
increase of 15% from the previous financial year of R13,7 billion to R15,8
billion.

A reflection of the budgetary spending on Defence by the Government in the
past year has witnessed limited participation in peace-supporting
operations. It furthermore proved to be a turbulent year for Government
with regard to the strategic defence procurement package, currently
estimated to be costing the taxpayer in excess of R43,8 billion, up from
the original more modest figure of R30,2 billion during December 1999.

Currently, international trends indicate that defence forces are
rightsizing and downsizing, both of which appear to be commonplace, with
ever-increasing demands made in the spheres of social needs and
development. Owing to the decision taken by the executive, it has
experienced severe criticism for the political decision to allocate vast
sums of money to defence equipment in the face of possibly more pressing
demands domestically - such as poverty alleviation measures, housing and
infrastructure. The executive's own advisers advised them that the decision
to approve the strategic defence procurement deal was, to an extent, the
size of appetite Government had for risk, both politically and financially.

An important objective in any democratic society is to ensure transparency
and openness within government. It is the constitutionally entrenched
oversight role of the Joint Standing Committee on Defence and the Portfolio
Committee on Defence to exercise due and diligent oversight into the
actions of the department. Communication between the department and the
committees is poor, if not nonexistent, with the Minister of Defence
playing hide-and-seek with both committees. Recent attempts by both
chairpersons to ensure the presence of members of the Defence Secretariat
to attend committee hearings is a case in point.

On the invitation of the United States embassy and the European Command, I
recently formed part of a delegation of six members to the United States of
America. This was, firstly, to attend a distinguished visitors' tour, which
was followed by attending the fifth annual defence committee meeting held
between the United States and the South African Defence department. My
thanks and gratitude go to Col Nick Nicholson, especially, from the United
States embassy, and to Mr McConnell from the Pentagon for the invitation to
and effort in making this fifth annual conference a major success.

It was the emphasis on transparent, open and frank dialogue between the
Pentagon and Capitol Hill which was most notable. Precise details of issues
relating to the United States army, from which we could find guidance in
respect of a number of issues, were presented by Pentagon officials. This
approach of frankness and openness was subsequently confirmed by members of
the House of Representatives and by the professional staffers of members of
the Senate of the United States.

Such open and frank dialogue, unfortunately, does not exist between our
Parliament and the Department of Defence. This approach to openness and
frankness in the USA has, despite the levels of mistrust between the
Pentagon and Congress, formed the basis of their own attempts to rightsize
and downsize their defence force. I see that our chairperson of the
Portfolio Committee on Defence, Ms Thandi Modise, is also not here today.

It is important to note that in order for our Defence Force to maintain
strategic relevance in our region, the local defence industry will have to
become internationally competitive. This is necessary, especially in the
light of the fact that smaller, highly technical and advanced military
equipment is ever-increasingly needed to maintain relevance in the changing
strategic environment and to fulfil its role as a deterrent force.

We have, furthermore, reached the era of joint force interoperability -
that is, advanced interoperability between the established arms of service,
being the army, the air force and the navy. This concept appears to be the
answer to the success of smaller, but more effective, defence forces
throughout the world. This concept of interoperability will eventually have
to be extended to other forces in the South African defence co-operation
region should the Defence Force decide, at the request of the United
Nations, to participate more extensively in peace-support operations.

At present the SA National Defence Force has approximately 200 officers
with the rank of general, with a total force of approximately 74 000
members. In comparison, the German armed forces have 190 general officers
for a force of 320 000 members, whilst the United States marine corps has
70 general officers for a full-time force of 170 000. It is therefore clear
that, in comparison, we have far too many generals and far too few
deployable troops. Too many troops are not deployable owing, inter alia, to
medical reasons and a lack of combat-readiness. In addition, too many
troops, of which the average age is 32, are too old to be foot soldiers
with the rank of private in the army.

At a press conference on 4 June this year held by our party, the Democratic
Alliance, and after a thorough investigation into all aspects of the
strategic defence procurement deal, the following decision, which we
reconfirm, was taken in respect thereto.

Firstly, the Government should honour only those parts of the strategic
defence procurement contract - which can be divided into three main
tranches - to which it is committed. It should not take up its options to
purchase a further 12 Hawk and 9 Gripen aircraft, which would lead to a
saving of approximately 28,8% on the full contract price.

The saving would be effected by not exercising options two and three, which
form part of the contract to purchase the additional 12 Hawk and 9 Gripen
aircraft. The contract price was initially valued at R30,2 billion, which
has, within a period of approximately 18 months, escalated to a figure of
between R43 billion and R50 billion, raising fundamental issues of
affordability, should the decision to exercise all three options be taken.

In the light of fierce penalties forming part of the contract should the
contract as a whole be cancelled, the DA supports the purchasing of the
four corvettes and three submarines as required by the navy, and nine
Gripen aircraft and four Hawk training aircraft as required by the SANDF.
The DA also supports the purchasing of 30 Augusta helicopters.

In terms of the latest figures of the contract price escalating to R43,8
billion, an approximate amount of R13 billion will still be available to
Government in the long term to enable them to introduce measures for
poverty alleviation and the provision of infrastructural, educational and
other social developmental needs, should the additional aircraft not be
purchased.

A donation of US$1 million, or approximately R8 million, by the United
States government to ensure repairs to the C130 fleet of air transport
carriers should be allocated to maintain the flying operability required by
the SANDF for, inter alia, support measures in Africa, should the need
arise. The United State's department of defence also indicated that more
funding might be forthcoming during the next financial year for purposes of
maintaining the serviceability of the C130 aircraft fleet.

A Defence Review for the SANDF was conducted during 1997-98. However, a
period of approximately four years has elapsed during which the demands and
conditions prevailing at the time have changed, necessitating the need for
a review of the existing Defence Review to adapt to the changed environment
in which the SANDF has to operate.

Requests for assistance in peace-support operations within the sub-Saharan
region and increased expectations to take a more leading role within the
SADC region have been increasingly forthcoming from the United Nations.
During the recent annual conference in the United States, assistance was
offered to our Government in respect of the failed programme relating to
the service corps. The Government's dismal failure in this regard has been
met with an extended hand of assistance with regard to the development of
human and vocational skills of Defence Force members leaving the service.

This is important to a developing country, which would be failing society
if members of the Defence Force were to leave without receiving any skills
beneficial not only to themselves, but also to the general public. These
include skills relating to projects such as the development of basic
infrastructure and the building of roads.

It is also important to note that the basic provision for spending within
the special defence account in respect of purchases will escalate from R4,5
billion for the present financial year of 2000-01 to the provision of R5,8
billion for 2001-02, R6,3 billion for 2002-03 and R7 billion for the
following year. This is only the foreseen cost the taxpayer will have to
pay for the decision to embark on the strategic defence procurement
packages.

The SANDF furthermore provides continued support to the SAPS to control
high-risk border areas and to ensure security in certain areas. This task
is, however, not a primary task of the Defence Force and leads to a lack of
morale among members of the Defence Force. The DA therefore calls on the
Minister of Safety and Security to ensure that, within the coming financial
year, the SAPS is in a position to perform those duties in terms of the
Constitution in order to relieve the Defence Force of these tasks.

Mr J N MASHIMBYE: Madam Speaker, Minister Lekota, senior officers of the SA
National Defence Force, members of the SANDF, hon members, the people in
the gallery are very special people. Men and women in uniform are very
special people. These are people who are prepared to serve South Africa, if
need be with their lives. They are prepared to pay the supreme sacrifice.
[Applause.]

Speaking in a debate on defence, a defence force that consists of these
special people, it would be a dereliction of duty on my part, especially as
a member of the ruling party, which has to govern, to stray from my
responsibility, which is to ensure that these special men and women get a
good deal from us as public representatives. It would be wrong to stray
from that, and do other things which are inconsequential. I will therefore
stick to my task.

It is appropriate to always remember those who have come before us in
political office in the service of the SANDF. In 1994, when we came here,
there was Minister Joe Modise, former Minister of Defence, and his deputy,
Ronnie Kasrils, and the first chairperson of the Joint Standing Committee
on Defence in Parliament, Comrade Tony Yengeni. I wish to pay tribute to
these comrades. I would also like to mention only one officer, Lt Gen
Masondo, who will be retiring in a few months. These comrades walked a path
that seemed impossible. They presided over a process of combining seven
military forces into one SA National Defence Force. People can say whatever
they like, but Joe Modise and the entire defence team have helped lay a
solid foundation for the process of building a single and strong SANDF.

As we confront a debate on our defence sector for the forthcoming year, it
is worthwhile, firstly, to recollect the immensity of the challenges we
have confronted within defence over the past seven years. We have, largely
successfully, managed one of the most difficult and profound defence
transformations that a postconflict and newly democratic state has had to
face during the post Cold War period.

Secondly, we need to be continually aware of the fact that our national
defence is not a party-political issue; that the preservation of
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the maintenance of the morale of
our men and women in uniform, is an issue of national concern, and indeed
pride. Although our defence transformation has not been without its
problems, and many of these problems remain with us today, it has been a
transformation process that has recorded unprecedented successes.

Let us examine the backdrop against which these occurred. This takes place
against a historical backdrop in which the defence function has been the
subject of much contest and controversy. The facts are well known in this
regard. The history of 20th century defence has been the history of a
defence force dominated by white officers, and largely serving white
interests, although its role in the Second World War is clearly an
exception in this regard.

Within the country the armed forces have been used against the people of
this country. We can recall incidents like the 1915 rebellion and the 1922
white mineworkers' strike. They were also used against the black miners in
1946 and the children of Soweto in 1976, and during various states of
emergency in the 1980s.

But, clearly, the election of the new government in the country's first
nonracial and democratic elections in 1994  signalled a major shift in the
country's political, strategic and economic environments, and, to a certain
extent, its intellectual environment. This impacted on all areas of state
and society, and defence was no exception in this regard. Apart from the
urgency of integrating the country's seven different armed forces into a
cohesive and united National Defence Force, it was imperative to translate
the challenges of the new environment into appropriate policies and
structures for the Department of Defence.

A range of challenges were evident here. These ranged from the need to
rightsize the Defence Force to the need to ensure representivity within its
structures via equal opportunity and affirmative action programmes and the
need to prepare for and participate in peace- support operations and
regional security agreements. There was also the importance of ensuring
civil control over the affairs of the military via the creation of a
civilian Defence Secretariat and the need to redefine military
professionalism to ensure that it represented all traditions and values
within our diverse and increasingly rich society.

Let us dwell on these issues in more detail. It is instructive for members
of the House to note that we have managed to integrate no fewer than eight
different military and paramilitary formations into a cohesive National
Defence Force. This is an integration process unrivalled and historically
unparalleled, and one that we can be proud of.

A question remains, however: Has this process worked? I would venture to
say that it has. In substantiating this I will be using two criteria. The
first one is the simple fact that our

SANDF has, since 1994, continued to deliver those services that the nation
expects of it and that it is constitutionally mandated to deliver.
Notwithstanding the considerable differences that pervaded the organisation
at the time of integration, astute political leadership and military
pragmatism resulted in a situation where our armed forces rose above their
differences and rallied together in defence of our democratic Constitution.

The second criterion is the transformation of our Defence Force in such a
manner that it can robustly claim to be more of a representative and
legitimate organisation than it was previously. We are beginning to achieve
and witness the birth of a defence force that is more demographically
representative than any of the previous defence forces this country has
seen. Another success is the extent to which we have managed to consolidate
democratic civilian relations within our country. The fears of military
intervention so toted during the pre-1994 period are now a distant memory.

Parliament is indisputably in control of the political processes, and the
activities of the SANDF are robustly overseen by our Ministry of Defence.
One of the key performance indicators in this regard is the extent to which
we as the Joint Standing Committee on Defence and the Portfolio Committee
on Defence have been the co-drivers and the overseers of the entire
national defence policy function, most notably the White Paper on Defence
and the Defence Review.

What about the present challenges? I would venture to say that they are
basically sixfold. The first is to ensure that the policy, which we have
devised and which is currently encapsulated in the Defence Review, is
continuously reassessed against the backdrop of changing strategic and
fiscal circumstances. No policy is cast in concrete, and one of the key
aspects of good governance is to ensure that both Government and the
legislature revise and revisit the defence policy which we jointly
formulated.

We - all parties in the House - formulated the Defence Review on the basis
of what we saw our national defence priorities to be. We decided on this
basis to procure the equipment which we are currently in the process of
securing. We need this equipment, but we also need to ensure that the
equipment we have procured is used in as flexible a manner as possible.

We face a wide range of tasks in ensuring that the SANDF is used as an
instrument of Government policy, and we need to continually revise or
adjust the policy upon which this is based. For this reason, we are
adjusting the defence policy in whose formulation we, the JSCD, play such
an important role. This does not imply a crisis or a lack of confidence in
our present policy, but merely reflects our responsibility as the elected
legislators to ensure that policy, the cornerstone of good governance,
remains consistent with strategic and budgetary realities.

The theoretical and intellectual environment within which the debate is
taking place has substantially changed from that of previous years.
Firstly, the debate is much more open, transparent and accessible than it
was before. Secondly, it has escaped much of the intellectual parochialism
that pervaded defence debates during the Cold War period. Let me explain
this further. Whilst the Defence White Paper clearly states that the
primary function of the National Defence Force is that of the preservation
of the country's territorial integrity and sovereignty, which is also
mandated by the Constitution, it also recognises a range of other functions
that we are required to perform. These include peace-support operations,
support to the SA Police Service, and a range of other tasks, which we can
do by virtue of our organisational and managerial abilities.

We need, therefore, to move away from a threat-based approach, with regard
to designing our armed forces, and ask ourselves what defence forces are
for, rather than asking what they are against. Defence forces are clearly
there for the protection of the country against external threat, they are
also there for the furtherance of national interests, when so ordered into
service by the government of the day, and as such are used for other
important functions such as internal stability and regional security. In
essence, armed forces are there as an instrument of national policy
management and are used in this role when the capabilities of other state
departments to accomplish these national policy objectives are limited
and/or are nonexistent.

Indeed, the history of this country shows that we have always used our
armed forces for secondary functions, for example, the 1915 rebellion, the
1922 strike, the First World War, the Second World War and the Korean War.
We must obviously take this into account when we design our Defence Force
and avoid the myopic view of no threat, therefore no defence force. This is
only one aspect of defence force capabilities.

Let me turn to another issue. We need to ensure the transformation of the
part-time forces. We are primarily a citizen-based defence force, and have
been historically so. Even more importantly, within the current situation
it is vital for us to ensure that the principle of the citizen in uniform
remains deeply enshrined in our military culture. The part-time force
should become representative of the country's diverse communities. It
should reflect the country's diverse military traditions and it should be
deployed in the service of all sectors of the community. This is a major
challenge for the Defence Review to address.

It is important to ensure that we optimise both our force design and our
force structure in a cost-effective manner. We must eliminate unnecessary
wastage, duplication and expenditure. The issue of representivity needs to
be addressed. We must formulate, for both internal and external
consideration, a policy on equal opportunity and affirmative action for our
department. Such representivity must be achieved both horizontally and
vertically within both the full-time and the part-time force.

Demobilisation and rationalisation remain one of our most important
challenges of the future. We must ensure that all women and men, regardless
of military background or region, are reintegrated into civil society in a
manner that does not prejudice their individual welfare or overall social
stability. We have made moves in this direction, but need to ensure that
the strategy moves beyond the realm of the Department of Defence and
becomes a national concern.

Finally, we need to ensure that civil oversight, the universal principle of
any functioning democracy, remains solidly inscribed in the functioning of
our defence community. We must resolutely and consistently endeavour to
ensure that the capacity of our Ministry of Defence and our Defence
Secretariat to oversee and manage our defence function is robustly
maintained. I must repeat that representivity must be seen and felt at the
implementation level of the hierarchy of the armed forces.

These people at the junior level, some of them sitting in the gallery, must
be able to see representivity at work. We must move away from a situation
in which there are only 75 colonels from the nonstatutory forces and 563
from the old SADF. We must make sure that with every footstep they march,
their heartbeat is always felt in our pulse. [Applause.]

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Madam Speaker, hon members, our honoured guests, I want
to start off by encoring what our Secretary of Defence wrote, and I quote:
  We have had enough policy, enough plans and enough projects. The greatest
  challenge facing us today is implementation.

This could well be a message to all our Government departments. Yes, all
our departments develop the best policies, plan well and do everything,
except implement the policies they have worked on. From ancient times to
the present day, the role of a defence force has always remained the same:
to defend its country and its citizens.

Our Defence Force has, as members know, three components: the army, the air
force and the naval forces. In order for our Defence Force to defend our
sovereignty and territory, South Africa is constitutionally obliged to
maintain a professional and technologically sophisticated core peacetime
defence capability, which is accountable to the people. However, for our
Defence Force to carry out its obligations it needs more money.

What is more important is that the SA National Defence Force is also a
creator of employment. The Defence Force needs engineers, doctors, nurses,
caterers, communication experts, mechanics, you name it. The Defence Force
is expected to assist in peacekeeping and in acting quickly and efficiently
in times of crisis and wars. Only when we have a proper defence policy,
which is implementable, and only when we have an appropriate budget
allocation can our forces be acknowledged, acceptable and well-disciplined.

I find it very unacceptable when people complain about funding for our
Defence Force. They argue by saying, ``Who are we fighting against? Who are
we at war with?'' Yet they forget that our Defence Force is also fighting a
great war in this country. Yes, we are at war. We are at war against crime,
we are at war to maintain the safety of our citizens. Even our Police
Service would be helpless with rebuilding this country into a new
democratic society if it were not for our Defence Force. For this they
need, and South Africa needs, a well-equipped army.

Our soldiers have been deployed in peacekeeping operations internally and
externally. Let us not repeat the mistake which the then government made
with their soldiers, particularly when they returned from World War II -
our black, Indian and coloured soldiers who fought for a shilling a day.
When they came back they were given a bicycle and a coat to say thank you.
[Interjections.] The reaction of the white ex-servicemen was only to kick
out Jan Smuts and replace him with another animal, Dr Malan, and that made
our lives a misery. [Applause.]

I must bring it to the attention of the hon the Minister that the
retrenchment of the black, Indian and coloured soldiers, through the
Department of Defence's rationalisation process was, in a sense,
discriminatory against the soldiers. I hate it! The whole process of
rationalisation favoured white soldiers. Even the remuneration of these
soldiers was also discriminatory. Why is this?

I would like to appeal to the hon the Minister to appoint a committee to
investigate this discrepancy that has arisen. On the other hand, the
Minister should know that our camps are bedevilled by racism which still
exists there. Whereas we accept that laws cannot change people's attitudes,
I believe we cannot close our eyes and ignore this cancer that is present
in our camps. Whether it is racism from whites or blacks, we should get rid
of it immediately.

Whereas the Defence budget has increased by R2,1 million, what we must not
lose sight of is that 66% of this increase results from increased spending
on the strategic arms procurement programme. The arms procurement deal
therefore swallows the budget to a large extent. If the increased spending
on the arms deal were taken off the present budget, the increase would only
be 4,9%, as opposed to 14,5%.

However, it is pleasing that additional funding has been made available for
training in the air force and the navy, to prepare for the receipt of new
aircraft and maritime assets, as part of the arms procurement deal. What is
of great concern and, indeed, disturbing is that although the allocation to
the South African Military Health Service increases by R124 million, no
specific provision has been made for fighting HIV/Aids, in the Defence
Force. It is alleged that the incidence of HIV/Aids is much higher than we
are led to believe by our officers in the army. If that were, indeed, the
case, one would have expected to see a specific, considerable allocation to
help fight this disease.

To those brave, dedicated men and women of the SA National Defence Force
sitting there, who patrol our borders, and are engaged in peacekeeping and
assist in fighting crime, let me say that at the going down of the sun and
in the morning, we will always remember their work. Their valuable work
will always be appreciated.

In ending, I want to say that no country - I repeat, no country - can ever
prosper and command respect in the world without a strong, well-equipped
defence force. Therefore we need more money for this, if for nothing else.
[Applause.]

Mr L V J NGCULU: Madam Speaker, Minister of Defence, Deputy Minister of
Defence, three years ago we celebrated the heroic feat of the youth of
1976, who, armed with stones and dustbin lids, challenged the might of the
apartheid machinery. We commemorated the generation of 1976 who, when they
challenged the might of oppression, paid the supreme sacrifice, because
they dared to demand a better education. Now, 25 years later, we stand on
this podium in a democratic Parliament to support the Defence budget.

On 5 June 2001 the DA convened a press conference where they announced that
they would not be supporting the strategic packages. The DA has been
consistent in its quest to question the credibility of our Government in
its intention to re-equip the SANDF. What is never mentioned about the
effects of the isolation of South Africa is its impact on the weapons
system of the SANDF.

The democratic Government recognised the need to restore the core
capabilities which will make the new SANDF able to meet its core commitment
as defined in the Constitution. In the past the defence force relied on the
army, which was a pillar, and therefore any other interest was actually
neglected. To meet the perceived threat, therefore, the army was enlarged
and well-equipped and other arms of the service were abjectly neglected. It
was taking cognisance of this in 1994 that the Government considered the
need to ensure a refocus of this approach.

The new Government, steeped in the ANC's traditions of accountability,
openness and public participation, recognised that changes had to be
effected in line with this tradition in order to equip the SANDF.
Parliament and civil society at large had to play a critical role, hence
the Defence Review and the White Paper on Defence. After the adoption of
the White Paper in 1996, the Government decided to embark on a Defence
Review, which would indicate how the SANDF should be equipped.

The Defence Review process saw a number of stakeholders, ranging from
Parliament and the Defence Force to defence specialists, academics, NGOs,
individuals and other civil society organisations, participating in a
process hailed as seminal in South Africa. The Defence Review accepted that
there was a need and a responsibility on the part of Government to equip
the SANDF. It is this Defence Review adopted by Parliament in April 1998
which informed us how to equip the SANDF.

It is sometimes distressing to sit in this House and watch the opposition
displaying such a level of dishonesty and amnesia when dealing with the
current acquisition programmes. We should ask the DA whether anything has
changed in a mere three years to warrant their opposition to the defence
packages. Never in the history of South Africa have we ever seen an
opposition that is so hostile to change. [Applause.]

When some of them were called upon to rise up against the apartheid regime,
they decided to legitimise the apartheid regime by gracing these benches.
Some, when they were told of corruption regarding the special defence
account, virtually in each Vote, never questioned, but voted. When millions
of rands were squandered on these special defence accounts in the name of
white supremacy, they sat lamely in this House without protest.
Unaccountability and corruption were accepted in the name of the volk and
white supremacy.

Must we forget those funds from the special defence account which were
channelled to Jeugkrag in order to indoctrinate the white youth? Some of
the members of Jeugkrag, such as the deputy leader of the DA, Marthinus van
Schalkwyk and another member of Parliament, Dirk Bakker, sit in this House
today in the DA benches. Others are found in the office of the DP Chief
Whip. The leader of the DA, whilst serving the SADF, became a propagandist
of apartheid corruption. Even today it is surprising to me, looking at the
speakers' list, that one finds an NP speakerÿ.ÿ.ÿ.

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Madam Speaker, will the hon member take a question?

Mr L V J NGCULU: Yes.

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Madam Speaker, I wonder whether the hon member is aware
that the wife of the hon Van Schalkwyk was also a beneficiary of Jeugkrag,
having been the secretary of Jeugkrag in those days? [Laughter.]

Mr L V J NGCULU: How, then, can we be surprised when they today stand
loftily and yearn for the good old days when accountability and
transparency were treated with disdain? How, then, can we be surprised when
the DA mayor of Cape Town forges signatures in order to pursue narrow
political ends? That is why we in the ANC are never going to be distracted
from the path we have chosen, to have a defence force founded on the
principles of the rule of law and capable of meeting its core commitment,
which is the defence of South Africa and its people.

The Vote we are debating today should be supported by all those committed
to a peaceful and prosperous South Africa. We supported the hon the
Minister when he announced the acquisition of the Lear jet for the
President, and we will continue to do so. The leadership of our Government
travel all over the world selling South Africa to the community of nations.
The recent visit of the President to the UK was a resounding success. The
prophets of doom and gloom were left in awe of this success. Wherever the
President went, the government and the people of Great Britain rolled out
the red carpet for him. The presidential jet fits in with these demands of
our Government. The President deserves it because South Africa deserves it.


For our Government to continue to fulfil its obligations effectively and
efficiently, it must be properly equipped. It would be scandalous for any
political party not to support the acquisition of the presidential jet.
Verwoerd, Vorster, Botha and so on never needed special jets because they
had nowhere to land. The jet has therefore been acquired because South
Africa is a democracy. In other words, it is the dividend of democracy.
[Laughter.]

We are happy that the transformation process is moving forward unimpeded.
We should always remind ourselves that integrating seven different armies,
each with its own culture, traditions and military history into a defence
force committed to a common culture and identity, is something we should
all applaud. We readily admit that there is a still a long way to go. We
still find pockets of racism and indiscipline in the Defence Force. We are
happy to learn that the officers in the SANDF are committed to addressing
this problem. It would, of course, be naive of us to expect no racism in
the Defence Force when the broader society is grappling with this demon.
What is encouraging is that racism stands condemned in the Defence Force.
We once more should remember all those who died in the course of addressing
these problems.

As I stand at this podium, I am convinced that the gloom merchants who
often conveniently ignore the sheer scale and pace of change that the SANDF
has been subjected to during the last seven years will be proved wrong. We
are confident that transformation in all its forms, reduced budgets and
fundamental restructuring would dilute the capability and morale of most
advanced conventional forces. Yet the SANDF, which still has a long way to
go, is indeed a miracle in that so much has been achieved in such a short
space of time. We are pleased to see that now the Defence Force is no
longer seen as a place to save for other budgets.

The Department of Defence appreciates that the allocation in this financial
year has been stabilised. We hope that this situation will continue to
improve in order for the Defence Force to be equal to its task. I am sure
that the hon the Minister is aware of the pressures on the Defence budget,
in particular with reference to supporting the SAPS and peace-support
operations, and those from other departments. We hope, as we support all
those elements, that the Government will also consider these pressures on
the budget.

I would be failing in my duty if I did not congratulate the Minister and
the executive on the decision they took in recognising the services of the
nonstatutory forces in regard to pensions. It has always pained many of us
to note that the many years during which people served in the liberation
movement without hope of gain have never been recognised as service in the
democratic South Africa. Therefore the decision to recognise their service
will go a long way in cementing reconciliation and a spirit of co-operation
in the Defence Force.

We have watched the Minister with pride and admiration, seeing him trying
to confront the problems of the Defence Force with boldness and humility.
Whatever the issues and problems, the Minister was never found wanting.
Only an ANC Minister of Defence could have done this, steering defence on a
road of democracy and partnership in the region. Only the ANC could have
welded such a defence force, so that as we debate this budget today,
gracing these halls and this Chamber are the men and women who have served
the liberation movement by fighting for freedom.

When we celebrated 16 June, we also knew that there were those from the
Luthuli, the June 16 and the Mokhada detachments who today are senior
officers and NCOs in the National Defence Force. We salute them.
[Applause.] It is because of their blood, sacrifices and honour in serving
that today we can all guarantee that South Africa is a democracy which is
irreversible and unstoppable. We would like to support the Minister's
budget and wish him strength in his sterling work. [Applause.]

Mr M E MABETA: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister, hon
members, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago I watched the hon member of
Parliament Dr Jordan, a man who rarely shows emotion, speak with great
pain. He was addressing us on the issue of the relationship between the
state and Government interests. For those who do not like to follow wise
words, because they come from a particular political party, I want to say
that the most important line there was simply that here we differ on two
lines, the empty-minded and the open-minded. [Interjections.]

I want to assure the hon member that the Portfolio Committee on Defence,
the Joint Standing Committee on Defence and the national advisory board on
affirmative action, which is headed by the Defence Secretary, are totally
open-minded units. Also, a few days ago, hon Minister Geraldine Moleketi
also spoke with pain about the danger and the persuasive impact of
pessimism in the manner in which people talk about Africa. I want to assure
hon members that I will not talk from an empty mind or with pessimism.

The primary task of a defence force in South Africa is to ensure the
security of our nation and peace in the country and along its borders. We
can be thankful to our Defence Force, because for the past seven years we
have not been invaded or threatened, which is unique in Africa.

Our beautiful and rich country is free and recognised internationally as a
truly democratic society. This is so because of the supreme sacrifices made
by our young men and women who have dedicated their lives to fighting for
our liberation, and some of whom have committed themselves to safeguarding
the sovereignty of our country. I want to dedicate my speech to those young
men and women who have sacrificed their lives in pursuit of a noble dream,
the liberation of our country and the establishment of a truly democratic
South Africa.

The hon Mr Mashimbye has referred, and I agree with him, to the progress
that has been made in the transformation of the SA National Defence Force.
I also agree with him that there are problems of racism and insensitivity,
issues of diversity and the problems that the Defence Secretariat and the
directorate had with their equal opportunities and the affirmative action
that Gen Sedibe struggles with. We are doing everything to help her in
this.

Most important for today, I would like to dedicate my short speech to Col
Anthony Smith, the second-in-command at the School of Armour, and a star in
all his military courses in the Soviet Union, India, Yugoslavia, Angola and
South Africa. We will be saying the following to him this weekend.

[A hambe kakuhle. Inkosi ibe naye. [May he have a pleasant journey, and God
be with him.]

We need an explanation. It has been reported to me, and to many, that the
conditions that these young men and women have to live under when they get
sick and go to 1, 2 or 3 Military Hospital are terrible. It has also been
reported that in the presence of the parents of the particular person we
are burying this weekend - without a psychiatrist, without a psychologist,
without a councillor, without a priest, and without any office friends - a
doctor, whose name I will be giving, declared that he was going to die. I
think that these are the matters that need to be investigated. We will not
have a strong military unless we have   a healthy and highly motivated
Defence Force. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs Z A KOTA: Madam Speaker, hon members, let me dedicate my speech today
to the son of the Deputy Minister, Anthony Smith, with whom I left this
country during the difficult days of our country. He will be laid to rest
in the Eastern Cape on Saturday. He was a lieutenant-colonel in our Defence
Force.

Hon Minister, Comrade Terror Lekota, the Deputy Minister, Secretary of
Defence Mr Masilela, senior managers of the Defence Force, all protocols
observed, and members of the Defence Force in the gallery, hon members, let
me address this House on this important Defence debate. Let me congratulate
Admiral Retief on his appointment as Chief of the Navy. We worked together
in many instances in the Defence Force during the time of the Defence
Review.

I do know that there are people with short memories on the opposition side
of the House. [Laughter.] It is about time that we reminded them that we
have gone through a process in this House, and that they are in no way
going to deter us from reaching that goal. We have done so much in the
Defence Force. It is therefore important that we come to this House and
explain the mandate of the Defence Force. Our Defence Force has a mandate
to defend our Constitution and to protect South Africa; it has a legal
mandate to protect our borders as well as to perform other internal
operations in support of the SA Police Service.

I want to remind this House of the agreement concluded in June 1998 between
the SANDF and the SAPS and ratified by the Cabinet, which gave the
responsibility of border protection to the SANDF. The SANDF is to defend
the sovereignty of our country, to protect our marine resources, given the
vast exclusive economic zone that we have in our sea waters, and other
contingencies as explained by the Minister.

The Defence Review process looked at the capacity of the different arms of
service in terms of their ability to fulfil the mandate. It was therefore
suggested that we need a force structure and a core force that is balanced,
modern and technologically advanced in order for it to fulfil that mandate.
But the members on that side of the House must also remember that the ANC
Government inherited a navy whose fleet was in a state of obsolescence, as
it suffered from years of neglect during the apartheid days. South Africa
is in need of this capability. And we must remember what we did was also to
send men and women to sea in patrol vessels and submarines which could sink
at any time. If we had continued doing so, without making provision for any
improvement in that situation, we would have been irresponsible. Hence the
defence package. On the other hand, the air force needed some attention.
But I also want to remind the House that it is important that we remember
that the army does need attention.

Many people would argue that we do not need these weapons, as the greatest
enemy that we face in our young democracy, is poverty. I want to remind
them that a revolution that is not able to defend itself is useless. We do
need to defend the gains that we have made. It is for that reason that the
ANC Government has bought this defence equipment over a period of 12 years,
that is, the spaced acquisition. That will enable the Government to
continue to prioritise those areas of pressing need in order to address the
issue of poverty. It gives more money to education, housing and health.
This year's budget is also beginning to address the question of the
infrastructure.

It is therefore not a question of butter or guns, but rather an indication
that butter and guns equals security. It is important that we talk about
the spaced acquisition. Therefore, it means that we will pay R5 billion of
the country's budget to the arms procurement package over a period of 12
years.

The Defence White Paper and the Defence Review emphasise the importance of
the one-force concept, given the fact that our Defence Force is composed of
different forces, including the KwaZulu-Natal police. The ANC acknowledges
the fact that this diversity needs to be harnessed and managed effectively
in order to make the one-force concept a reality. It is for that reason
that the committee's main oversight function has been on the integration
and transformation process. This, to us, highlights the importance of both
the transformation and integration processes, how they are done and what
their successes and weaknesses are.

It is for this reason that I salute the Minister, the Secretary for
Defence, the Chief of the SANDF and Maj Gen Sedibe for forming the Civic
Education Monitoring and Advisory Committee and the advisory board which
deals with the issue of civil education, equal opportunity and affirmative
action. The hon Mabeta and I serve on that board on behalf of the defence
committees. This has, indeed, come about because the leadership of the
Defence Force, including the Minister and the Deputy Minister, have seen
the value of the one-force concept. If we have people who are able to work
together, despite their different cultural backgrounds, we will have a
defence force that is able to carry out its mandate with maximum efficiency
and in a state of combat readiness.

What has been the highlight of the success story is that this advisory
board is chaired by the Secretary for Defence. The policy of equal
opportunity and affirmative action has been made a level one function. This
will force the officers commanding to come up with programmes and
strategies for its implementation. In future, promotions and performance
appraisals will be linked to the successful implementation of that policy.

However, we do not want to create the impression that all problems will be
solved on the issue of diversity. But what I am saying is that the
department has put mechanisms in place to deal with those challenges. What
is important is the issue of civil-military relations, which has also been
taken seriously. I have observed the fact that the department is drawing in
organs of civil society in order to get advice from them on how to deal
with these issues since they are societal issues. The SANDF is, indeed, an
integral part of South African society. Where there is a will there is a
way. Building the one-force concept is indeed a process and not an event.

I want to acknowledge all the servicewomen who have made it to the senior
management of the SANDF. Among these are Lt Col Bobelo and Lt Col Mpaxa,
who is the first woman to be in the infantry at 14 SAI. [Interjections.] It
is also important to note that we have only one woman military attaché.
That is a problem. But we have been given the assurance by the Secretary
for Defence that this matter will be addressed as soon as possible.

We have a Defence Force that is no longer at war with its neighbours. Our
chief of the National Defence Force, Comrade Gen Nyanda, on visiting
various parts of Angola, realised that something had to be done to
alleviate the situation in Angola. For that reason, I support the call that
he made that the establishment of peace in Angola as soon as possible is
very important, and that it is in the interests not only of Angola, but of
the entire region.

The SANDF's commitment to peacekeeping missions is in line with President
Thabo Mbeki's continued call for us to build a South Africa in which all
members of the region take part in ensuring a lasting peace in the region.
Gone are the days when our defence force was used to bomb our neighbouring
states. We have a defence force which is very committed to bringing about
peace in our continent and whose mission it is to defend our Constitution.
We have men and women who continue to be prepared to pay the supreme
sacrifice in defence of our country.
Our military supremacy should be used to harness the spirit of good co-
operation and governance. It is for this reason that I support the peace
effort missions that are spearheaded by the former President, Nelson
Mandela, and members of the SANDF led by Lt Gen Masondo, to bring about
peace in Rwanda and Burundi. Let our Defence Force carry the torch of peace
in Africa and all parts of the world. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, hon Minister and members of the SA National
Defence Force, the growth of the Defence budget by about R2 billion is
substantial. As we live in relatively peaceful times, the current budget of
R15,8 billion should sustain the basic operational costs of the National
Defence Force. It is, however, in times of peace that the nation's Defence
Force should, according to the Defence Review, maintain, develop and
prepare those forces that form the basis of its conventional defence
capabilities.

It is, therefore, discouraging when we receive reports of the deterioration
in the standard of our National Defence Force due to ill-discipline, crime
and negligence. Reports that we lack military discipline and productivity
are factors that have been mentioned by the secretariat as key challenges
facing the department. The large number of outstanding court martials is
also a matter of serious concern. There is a great need to restore respect
for sound discipline. Our officers and NCOs must have the confidence to
impose discipline albeit with compassion and without fear of being accused
of being racist, whether they are black or white.

We must also move with urgency in finalising the investigations into the
arms procurement processes, prosecute any person implicated in any
corruption and restore the integrity of our defence procurement processes.
The ACDP is, further, in agreement that in view of the escalation of the
contract price, which is compounded by a depreciating rand, the Government
should consider only honouring those parts of the contracts to which it is
committed and where cancellation would involve penalties. In this regard,
the options to purchase further Hawk and Gripen aircraft should be
carefully reconsidered as substantial savings could be affected here. I
would like to tell the hon the Minister that I say this notwithstanding my
close affinity to the SA Air Force.

We must also move swiftly to control the level of HIV/Aids cases in our
Defence Force. It is estimated that about 12% of our soldiers suffer from
Aids. The exponential spread of this disease throughout the National
Defence Force will render our Defence Force useless, weaken the security of
the nation and negatively impact on the peacekeeping role that South Africa
can play in Africa.

The integration progress report and final report further make for
compelling reading. The last sentence of the report by Brigadier Keeling
which states that ``it has been a huge privilege to witness this remarkable
integration process which, warts and all, remains the most successful of
its kind in the world'', speaks volumes for the success of the integration
process, despite various setbacks and limited funding. The ACDP commends
all members of the SA National Defence Force for making integration such a
success.

In conclusion, the ACDP wishes to commend the Defence Force for its ongoing
nonmilitary humanitarian tasks, ranging from flood relief to mountain and
sea rescue missions. Let us also not forget the role played by the large
number of troops deployed in assisting the Police Service to maintain law
and order, as well as border patrols attempting to stem the tide of illegal
immigrants. Let us also remember those members of the force involved in
peacekeeping operations in the DRC.

The ACDP will support this Vote. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, the previous speaker spoke
about deteriorating standards. I would like to invite him to come with us
to the bases to see the readiness of our members. Very recently there was a
competition in Bloemfontein, which was attended by 12 countries, six of
whom were international ones. Our soldiers came first in all of those
exercises. [Applause.] It is important that members inform themselves
before they make allegations.

Parliament has given the Ministry of Defence five main tasks. These are
integration, demobilisation, defence review and procurement,
transformation, and a wider developmental role for the SANDF. These tasks
are to be undertaken together and speedily. I wish to acknowledge the role
played by our predecessors, Comrades Joe Modise and Ronnie Kasrils, in
laying the foundation for the doctrine of defence in a democracy. They
courageously embarked on a massive project of bringing together seven
disparate forces into one united SANDF.

Since 1994 we have embarked on a project of transforming our previously
divided past and building a single South African nation. Our diversity is
our strength. Transformation is not an overnight project; it is also not
only about numbers, but about transforming culture and values. For the
Department of Defence it is a change from white baasskap in an apartheid-
siege state to an integrated force giving full expression to the cultures
and strengths of all, united and projecting the image of a peaceful
neighbour and creating peace in Africa. In the short time since the birth
of our new nation, we have laid the groundwork. Now we are rolling out our
programmes in line with national imperatives.

The Department of Defence's total strength of 78 701 is made up of 26%
white Africans, 12% coloured Africans, 1% Indian Africans and 61% African
Africans, as opposed to the 1994 ratio of 46:15:1:38. We have entrenched
equality not only in our Constitution, but also in our policies, and we
continue to develop towards greater representivity. If the opposition were
to listen, they would learn something from this Government.

Women constitute just over 20% of the department's total strength. Although
30% representation of women in the Department of Defence has not yet been
reached, the targets help us focus our energies and resources. In August,
we will be highlighting the issue of women in the military. Our first lady,
Comrade Zanele Mbeki, will be hosting a special celebration in August on
the role played by women in the services.

I also acknowledge the stewardship of Maj Gen Jackie Sedibe, chief director
of the equal opportunity and affirmative action programme. Our first female
commander will be inaugurated in Umtata this Friday, 22 June. This serves
to demonstrate the Department of Defence's determination to prove that the
days are gone when a woman's place was in the kitchen. The equal
opportunities chief directorate was specifically established and mandated
to institutionalise equal opportunities and affirmative action in the
Department of Defence. The EOCD reports directly to the Secretary for
Defence.

The Department of Defence's affirmative action forum monitors the
implementation of affirmative action plans. There is a drive to give women
their rightful position in all ranks, levels and positions, as well as in
combat roles. The gender forum is charged with co-ordinating gender
programmes and monitoring progress. There were no women in the highest
ranks of our National Defence Force structures before. Today 7% of our top
leadership is occupied by women. We look forward to our first woman
lieutenant general and chief of the SA National Defence Force in the not
too distant future.

The department acknowledges its responsibility towards people with
disabilities. A Department of Defence disability forum has been established
in order to highlight the issues of disability and to integrate them.
Annually the Department of Defence hosts a function to celebrate the
achievements of our disabled members.

We know too well the consequences of not dealing with racism. Racism
seriously undermines the ability of any defence force to perform its
function of defending the nation. We see the need to address racism at its
roots in every individual, with the full support of the leadership, backed
by effective training and redress. In a drive to raise awareness and
education, the department has engaged in road shows and cultural diversity
education. We will include antiracism as a qualifying course for our
officer corps.

Now is the time for the nuts and bolts by means of which we fasten the
SANDF into a tighter military force, united in its drive to be a truly
African force, under civilian control. The strategic direction has now been
promulgated as part of the Department of Defence programme. In this regard,
I want to focus on specific areas of attention, the first being to sharpen
the tools of the Ministry to deliver on its mandate and to tighten its
links with the defence community. I am looking into how we can develop
fully the concept of civilian oversight. We have, with the assistance of
the US department of defence, begun a programme focusing on civil-military
relations.

The Department of Defence has embarked on training to ensure that our
department understands the requirements set out by the National Treasury.
We have focused on reprioritisation, rooting out financial mismanagement
where it appears, and wastage. The office of the chief of finance is hard
at work developing best-practice measures for all our budget holders.

The second specific area of attention is to complete the legislative
processes, enabling full integration and transformation. We have
prioritised finalisation this year of the Defence Act, the National
Conventional Arms Control Bill, the Termination of Integration Intake Bill,
the Demobilisation Bill, and the Armscor Bill.

Our present Defence Act is outdated and needs to reflect the requirements
of defence in a democracy. A new defence Act will underscore the
transformation of the SA National Defence Force in a nation that is at
peace with itself and seeking to play a positive role on the African
continent. As we do so, we realise that the SANDF must develop the skills
and training it needs to be able to contribute to the United Nations and
other African peace operations. We are convinced of the value of discreet
diplomacy.

The drafting of the Defence Bill has been completed. It is hoped that the
Bill will be passed in the third session of Parliament. The National
Conventional Arms Control Bill is now also with the state law advisers.
This Bill will put into law the criteria Cabinet has developed on
government-to-government arms sales.

South Africa must be proud of its role in ensuring a responsible defence
industry. I do not think there is a country that has been as transparent as
we have been on this issue. We are proposing substantial reforms to the
Armscor Act, and the drafting of policy guidelines for the Armscor Bill has
been completed.

The Termination of Integration Intake Bill, Constitution of the Republic of
South Africa Amendment Bill and Demobilisation Amendment Bill have been
introduced. These laws are not intended to bar people from entering the
SANDF through the normal channels or those who have not been able to
integrate because their amnesty applications were still under
consideration.

Then there is the issue of ensuring that the SANDF gets to full
representivity in four years. Hand in hand with this goes the need to turn
the SANDF into an excellent employer. We are developing a comprehensive
human resource strategy as important as the armaments acquisition
programme. Every member who enters the Defence Force must know that we will
look after him while in our force and after leaving. Proper demobilisation
and veteran care will form an integral part of the department's
comprehensive human resource package.

I want to deal with the important issue of HIV/Aids that other members have
referred to. We are looking at this matter very seriously. Current figures
have indicated that figures pertaining to HIV-infection are lower in the
SANDF than in our society. However, we remain vigilant. We acknowledge the
threat of HIV/Aids to our security and readiness. Our HIV/Aids strategy is
in line with the National Aids Plan while taking into account the special
environment in which soldiers work.

I want to report to this House that we conduct comprehensive health
assessments to ensure the readiness of our soldiers. We acknowledge our
responsibility to treat those affected and infected with dignity and
recognition of their human rights. We are committed and ready to roll out
the next phase of our HIV strategy focusing on behaviour change, voluntary
testing, treatment and care specific to the military and to create an
environment free of discrimination and stigma. Fifthly, we must establish a
true African culture in the SANDF and, finally, ensure increased
utilisation of the SANDF as a catalyst for development.

An audit will be conducted to determine the resources we have in the
engineer corps to assist the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development
Strategy. The Department of Defence has, together with the Department of
Public Works, developed a comprehensive base closure policy as our
contribution to black empowerment.

Let me, at this stage, address the issue of the Service Corps. I want to
explain what we are proposing. The Service Corps was established as the
centrepiece in our attempts to assist demobilised soldiers as part of the
department's contribution to the RDP. The response of the SANDF during the
floods is an excellent example of the collateral utilisation of SANDF
resources. The Service Corps, in an effective form, can become the nation's
flagship for assisting with the demobilisation and reintegration programme
for retrenched civil servants. It can become the mobilising vehicle for
community service and development by helping to build the infrastructure
and soaking up the unemployed.

Regarding reports that members may have heard, we acted on the report of
our inspector-general. We conducted an investigation which looked at why
the Service Corps was not delivering at its optimal level. We have proposed
a re-engineering of the Service Corps. We have developed this in close
collaboration with the Department of Labour, the National Youth Commission
and the Women's Development Banking Group. The proposal will be taken to
other Government departments for their support.

Education could assist with the accreditation of military personnel for use
in civilian life. The technikons and universities can retrain former
soldiers and reorientate their skills as their contribution and
acknowledgement of the sacrifice and contribution of soldiers. We have the
support of the National Business Initiative and other business
organisations on this. They have offered to work with us in developing
public-private partnerships in line with Government practice. We will turn
the Service Corps around. A Cabinet memorandum will spell out these issues
in detail.

We are not proposing the privatisation of the Service Corps, but a
partnership with business to ensure delivery and cost-effectiveness. The
Department of Defence will remain a close partner, both as a client and a
service provider, to a re-engineered Service Corps, of which the Minister
of Defence is a patron, and he will continue in this role.

We have proposed that the resettlement function of the Service Corps be
retained in the department, while the reskilling and social integration is
taken up by a civilian national service corps, together with business. In
this way we would be ensuring that the important task is undertaken by
those whose business is business, and that the Department of Defence can
focus on its mandate to employ and prepare soldiers.

Sesenze imzamo yokubambisana nentsha ukuthuthukisa amakhono ayo ukuze

[We have made attempts to work together with the youth to improve their
skills so that they would be able to contribute to the revival of the
places in which they live. We are going to co-operate with the youth groups
such as SDU and SPU, as they played a role in protecting communities during
the times of violence. We will co-operate with them in creating job
opportunities and to stop crime in the places in which we live. We have
gone a long way towards working co-operatively with members of Parliament
and councillors. We began with the places which the President selected as
places to be protected. I am talking about areas like Mashu, Nanda, and
Ntuzuma under the Durban Metro. We are working together with the hon Duma
Nkosi. We have now proceeded to Kathorus on the East Rand. The Mayors of
these places, Father Mlaba and Vilakazi, are prepared to co-operate with
us. The aim of this programme is to fight violence which is caused by
unemployment.]
Government acknowledges that our organisational responses to the various
concerns and problems experienced by veterans and their families have been
inadequate. Veterans of MK and Apla have numerous legitimate concerns that
they have put before Government. Primary amongst those is the issue of
pensions. We have to present our case to the Treasury on this matter, as we
have done with regard to the men and women that are serving. We have
succeeded in amalgamating the various veterans' associations into a unified
structure under the directorship of a military veterans advisory board
which brings together former liberation struggle veterans and those from
the SADF.

Let me now come to the issue of addressing our military heritage. This year
we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the birth of MK. In 1994 Comrade Tony
Yengeni called upon Government to build a monument to those who fell in the
struggle for freedom. Various hon members have made similar calls for the
cadres of MK and Apla to be publicly commemorated. Government is proceeding
with the development of Freedom Park, as announced by the Deputy President
last year. We are participating in this.

Our military heritage project will take in the whole timeframe from the
Wars of Dispossession, the so-called Frontier Wars, onwards, and
geographically embrace the wider African continent. In so doing, we must
incorporate our activities into the President's Millennium African Recovery
Programme and our wider foreign policy objectives.

Finally, as the SA National Defence Force, we are well positioned to play
our role in ensuring peace in our region, which is a prerequisite to
development in the century and for the Millennium African Recovery
Programme. [Applause.]

Mr S B NTULI: Madam Speaker, Minister of Defence and other Ministers,
Deputy Minister, members of the SANDF, hon members, allow me to add my
weight, as well as my word, to this budget debate, on behalf of the ANC, of
course.

The core role of any defence force is to protect the territorial integrity
of a state. In our case, surrounded as we are by such a vast coastline,
there is an imperative that we protect our territorial waters, not only to
protect people and land on which we live, indeed not only to protect our
maritime resources - our marine life and the resources our ocean can
provide, both food and mineral - but also to fulfil our obligations to
assist our landlocked neighbours.

We need a well-equipped maritime defence force. We should not now be
questioning the recommendations of the Defence Review. Yes, we need to
reassess, but let us not be led astray by arguments about guns or butter.
We need the capacity to protect what is ours for the benefit of our nation.
Our marine resources are constantly under threat.

Competition over fishing grounds is not something new. Indeed the Basques
were so protective of their fishing grounds in the Middle Ages that they
hid the fact that they used to fish for cod off the coast of North America
from other nations. When Columbus arrived on the east coast of America in
1492, the Basque fishing fleets were harvesting the marine wealth. However,
fishing has never known such fierce competition as today. The Government
and the navy were criticised for the support we gave to the Australian
government in apprehending a trawler that was caugat fishing illegally in
Australian waters.

Illegal fishing is the piracy of the 21st century. Our resources are being
depleted daily. We have heard a lot about the cost of corvettes, some R8
billion. Their estimated life is 30 years. But, on the other hand, over the
past five years we have lost up to 10 000 tons of Patagonian tooth fish per
year to illegal fishing, let alone other marine resources. I have only
referred to one species. I will not bother the House with a lot of figures
but at current prices this is worth R4 billion over five years. Over 30
years this loss of revenue could be as much as R254 billion. Does the price
of the corvette not seem worthwhile in this context?

Talk is cheap. It is easy to make grand statements about the people needing
houses and food, but the fact remains that without protection our resources
are plundered. Our food is stolen from our plates. It is the duty and the
obligation of this Government to ensure that the Defence Force is well
equipped to prevent our nation's wealth being plundered.

Our Defence Force is one of which we can be proud, as has been acknowledged
today. It has weathered the challenges of transformation. It has risen from
the ashes of our history with the determination to play a role in the
building of a united democratic nation. Of course, it still faces many
challenges.

As we in the ANC address the challenges facing our continent, we must not
forget that we live in times of great instability. Our continent is still
seeking a path to peace and economic viability. Our only chance for long-
term prosperity is through the rebirth of our continent and our region, and
our Defence Force has a special role to play in this regard.

The Minister's report on progress in the implementation of the protocol is
a significant step toward building a united, secure region. Too often, of
late, we have been subjected to a revisionist analysis of our recent
history with regard to defence issues. The DP and the so-called New NP, now
the unholy Democratic Alliance, supported the Defence Review in the spirit
of patriotism and nation-building. May I ask them whether they still
support the Defence Review? Or have they decided that it is unpatriotic to
protect the integrity of our united South Africa? [Interjections.]

Last year in his speech the Minister gave details of a procurement package.
There was no loud protest from the opposition. But today, sensing a
political gap, the opposition is making loud noises, stirring up insecurity
and distrust. To play on the fears and insecurities of the electorate as
the DA and the UDM are doing, is dangerous politics. It is irresponsible
and foolish politics.

The safest thing for the nation to do is to unite. We have forged a united
Defence Force. We have built unity in this country, which has never existed
before. We are breaking down the walls that had divided us. I appeal to the
opposition not to march backwards into our past of division and distrust,
but to march forward to a united Defence Force, protecting the interests of
a united nation.

Having said that, I move on behalf of the ANC that all of us in the House
should support this Vote. [Applause.]

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, I want to ask the hon the Minister if he
received a Mercedes-Benz on a preferential scheme, yes or no.
[Interjections.] Whether the Minister will say yes or no, nobody knows. The
fact of the matter is that Daimler Chrysler mentioned, and has supplied 30
names of top officials and politicians who received motor vehicles on a
preferential scheme. [Interjections.] Why does the hon the Minister not
declare these names and give them to the media and the public so that the
people of South Africa can see who these people are? The impression is that
all these motor vehicles were given to people who were involved in the
weapons and armaments transaction. Therefore I want to say that if the hon
the Minister is a responsible Minister, he would declare the names so that
the people could know.

Die ondersoek wat oor die wapentransaksie gedoen word, is nie tot die
nadeel van die ANC en politici nie. [The investigation into the arms deal
is not to the detriment of the ANC and politicians.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Take your seat, hon member.

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker, can the hon member
really substantiate the statement that he is making here now and the
accusations that he is making against Ministers? Can he really substantiate
them?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Is that a question that you are posing to the
hon member?

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Yes.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, would you like to respond to the question?

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, it seems this hon member does not know
the difference between a question and a statement. I did not make a
statement, I asked a question. Is the hon the Minister to make a statement,
yes or no?

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: This hon member is
attacking the hon the Minister, knowing full well that all motor companies
... [Interjections] ... I am not going to name them - are making offers to
members of Parliament and giving discounts, because they are members of
Parliament. [Interjections.] I want to ask this hon member if, in his life,
he ever received such offers from BMW, Daimler Chrysler or Toyota?
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, I do not want a debate between you
and the hon members. Hon member, please proceed.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Dankie, mevrou die Speaker. Dit lyk my dié agb lid het
ook 'n Mercedes gekry. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Ek gaan voort. Ek wil vandag hier sê die VF het van die begin af hierdie
wapenaankope gesteun. Die agb Minister van Finansies het dit nou die dag
goedgedink om my aan te haal toe ek sou gesê het, as ons nie die wapens
aankoop nie, gaan ons op die ou end 'n flentergatweermag hê. Ek staan
daarby! Die wapenaankope moes plaasgevind het tot voordeel van die SA
Nasionale Weermag.

Die VF het egter nie gesê daar kan korrupsie plaasvind nie. Ek wil die agb
Minister vra wat geword het van die teenhandel wat sou voortvloei uit
hierdie wapentransaksie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is oral in die wêreld
verkondig dat Suid-Afrika meer as R100 miljard se teenhandel gaan kry uit
hierdie wapentransaksie, en dat derduisende werkgeleenthede geskep sal
word, veral in die krygstuignywerheid, wat tegnologiese ontwikkeling nodig
het. Dit is iets wat deur die VF verwelkom is. Hoekom hoor ons nie van
hierdie werkgeleenthede wat geskep is nie? Hoekom hoor ons nie van die
teenhandel wat plaasgevind het nie? [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die hantering van hierdie hele aangeleentheid deur die ANC strek tot nadeel
van die beeld van die SA Nasionale Weermag. Dit is die lede van die Weermag
wat hier agter sit wat gekonfronteer word met stellings dat hulle mos deel
is van die SA Nasionale Weermag en dat hulle mos die uniform dra. Dit is
egter die politici en die agb Minister van Verdediging wat deur hulle
onbeholpe hantering van hierdie saak hierdie beeld skep van die SA
Nasionale Weermag. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Ek wil verder gaan aangesien ons dan nou besig is met die ondersoek van
wapenaankope. In 1993 is daar 'n aantal Pilatus PC7 MKII-vliegtuie
aangekoop. Ek het spesifiek vrae gevra oor bewerings van kommissies wat
betaal is, wat ontken is, maar in 1996 het die Ouditeur-generaal bevind dat
R28 miljoen aan kommissies betaal is.

Die Kantoor vir Ernstige Ekonomiese Misdrywe, wat nou Odeem is, het hierdie
saak ondersoek, en hy het op die ou end bevind dat meer as R52 miljoen al
aan kommissies betaal is. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die VF versoek die agb
Minister, aangesien daar 'n ondersoek is, om dan hierdie saak ook daarby te
voeg sodat die lede wat hier agter sit, kan vrykom van hierdie wolk wat oor
hulle hang as gevolg van politici se optrede. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Thank you, Madam Speaker. It seems as if that hon
member also received a Mercedes. [Interjections.]

I want to proceed. I want to say here today that from the very beginning
the FF supported these arms purchases. The hon the Minister of Finance saw
fit to quote me the other day, when I had said that if we did not purchase
the arms we would end up with a ``flentergatweermag''[a ragged defence
force]. I still feel that way! The arms purchases should have taken place
to the benefit of the SA National Defence Force.

However, the FF did not say that corruption could take place. I want to ask
the hon the Minister what has become of the countertrade that was to have
resulted from this arms transaction. [Interjections.] It was announced all
over the world that South Africa would gain over R100 billion in
countertrade from this arms transaction, and that thousands of job
opportunities would be created, especially in the munitions industry, which
requires technological development. This was welcomed by the FF. Why have
we not heard about these job opportunities that have been created? Why have
we not heard about any countertrade that has taken place? [Interjections.]

The handling of this entire matter by the ANC is to the detriment of the
image of the SA National Defence Force. It is the members of the Defence
Force sitting at the back here who are confronted with statements that
surely they are members of the Defence Force and they wear the uniform. It
is the politicians and the hon the Minister, however, who created this
image of the SA Defence Force through their inept handling of this matter.
[Interjections.]

I want to proceed, seeing that we are now dealing with the investigation
into arms purchases. In 1993 a number of Pilatus PC MKII aeroplanes were
purchased. I asked questions relating specifically to allegations about
commissions that had been paid, and this was denied, but in 1996 the
Auditor-General found that an amount of R28 million in commissions had been
paid.
The Office for Serious Economic Offences, which is now called Idseo,
investigated this matter, and in the end found that over R52 million had
already been spent on commissions. [Interjections.] The FF requests the hon
the Minister, since there is an investigation, to add this matter to it, so
that the members sitting at the back here could be freed of this cloud that
looms over them owing to the actions of politicians.]

The FF therefore requests that an investigation into the Pilatus
transaction also be added to this investigation.

Ek gaan verder. Die agb Minister is veronderstel om 'n voorbeeld te stel
vir die mense in die Weermag. Dit is egter dieselfde agb Minister wat besig
is om die Weermag te verpolitiseer. Hoekom sê ek hy verpolitiseer die
Weermag? [Tussenwerpsels.] As daar 'n swart soldaat is - nogal 'n offisier
- wat sy kompaniebevelvoerder in Phalaborwa doodskiet - 'n blanke majoor -
dan gaan besoek die agb Minister die basis, en op die ou end beskuldig hy
die bevelvoerder, en die bevelvoerder moet vervang word. [Tussenwerpsels.]
Watter beeld ... [Tussenwerpsels.] Daardie agb lid moet maar liewers in die
meerkatgate gaan wegkruip, want hy lawaai net daar agter in die kombuis.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Die agb Minister se optrede skep die indruk dat as 'n mens swart is en jy
pleeg wandade, dit geregverdig is, want die politici en die Minister sal
agter jou staan. Dan word die skuld nog geplaas op die blanke
bevelvoerders. As die agb Minister wil professioneel optree, moet hy gaan
kyk na die kundigheid van hierdie offisiere en dan moet die kriterium
meriete wees en daarvolgens moet hy dan die beeld skep dat dit 'n
professionele weermag is. [Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[I want to proceed. The hon the Minister is supposed to set an example to
the people in the Defence Force. It is this very same Minister, however,
who is politicising the Defence Force. Why am I saying that he is
politicising the Defence Force? [Interjections.]  If there is a black
soldier - an officer in fact - who shoots dead his company commander in
Phalaborwa - a white major - then the hon the Minister visits the base, and
in the end he accuses the commanding officer, and the commanding officer
must be replaced. [Interjections.] What image ... [Interjections.] That hon
member should rather go and hide in the mongoose burrows, because he is
just making a noise back there in the kitchen. [Interjections.]

The hon the Minister's actions create the impression that if one is black
and one commits an offence, it is justified, because the politicians and
the Minister will be behind one. What is more, then the white commanding
officers are blamed. If the hon the Minister wishes to act professionally,
he should go and look at the expertise of these officers and then the
criterium should be merit and on those terms he should create the image
that it is a professional defence force. [Time expired.]]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, the establishment of the state-of-the-
art Service Corps training centre in Pretoria was hailed as a step in the
right direction in addressing the much-needed skills to enable and empower
former uMkhonto weSizwe and Azanian People's Liberation Army members to
acquire skills needed in the labour market and for those interested in
starting their own businesses.

However, there are serious allegations of mismanagement in the Service
Corps and a lack of proper accountability for moneys obtained from the
Defence budget. The alleged abuse of resources earmarked for the former
liberation movement cadres leaves much to be desired, because many of them
are destitute and some are not aware of the existence of the Service Corps
training facilities.

It is common knowledge that the integration and demobilisation of the eight
former forces has been a painful process. The Defence Force's downsizing
exercise from 100 000 to a peacetime target of 70 000 created the
undesirable situation we are currently faced with, as most of the young
former soldiers received packages and are currently unemployed, without any
of the skills required for them to enter the labour market.

There are allegations that the training institution is spending almost R600
000 per month on administration and salaries of programme facilitators and
instructors, for literally doing nothing. It is also alleged that since the
inception of the centre, fewer than a thousand individuals have benefited
from training provided by the Service Corps. Then the question is: What has
been happening to the moneys allocated to the Service Corps?

We applaud Gen Masondo's willingness to have forensic investigations
conducted into the affairs of the Service Corps, and his stance that any
proper investigation will reveal that no taxpayer's money has been
misappropriated. [Time expired.]

Mr L N DIALE: Madam Speaker, hon Minister of Defence Mosiuoa Lekota, hon
members and comrades, I also want to acknowledge the presence of our
glorious army, the SA National Defence Force.

Ke a le dumedisa ka moka. Ke a thaba go tsea karolo mo ngangisanong ye ya
sekhwama sa masole. [I greet you all. I am delighted to participate in the
debate on the National Defence Force.]

As a member and a commander of uMmkhonto weSizwe, the spear of the nation
... [Applause] ... Lerumo la Setshaba, I will speak on the issue of
integration.

Building one nation, united in its commitment to change, to eradicating the
divisions of the past and building democracy, is a key objective of our
Government. The SA National Defence Force must play a leading role in
forging this united nation.

The 1994 democratic elections provided us with the opportunity to transform
the old defence force, once regarded as the main bastion of apartheid, into
one which all South Africans could be proud of. The integration process, as
required by the interim Constitution, was never going to be easy. Whereas
MK was fighting for democracy and freedom for the majority, the old SADF
was fighting to maintain the apartheid system and the privileges bestowed
by it on a very small minority, many of whom are still sitting in this
Chamber.

Furthermore, the cultures and values within the nonstatutory forces such as
MK differed from the cultures and values of the statutory forces. In
uMkhonto weSizwe we believed in democracy, nonracialism, nonsexism and
accountability while the old SADF was characterised by ideological and
racist indoctrination.

Problems during the integration process were to be expected. The inability
of many of the former statutory force members to change their attitudes and
accept nonstatutory force members as equals was the cause of most of the
problems experienced during the integration process. It is to the credit of
the Minister of Defence that he acted swiftly and decisively whenever
problems arose. The investigation into the Tempe shooting and the
subsequent Setai commission are proof of the urgency with which the
Minister and his department have acted to resolve any problems.

The fact that we have been able to manage this integration process without
any major problems has much to do with the responsible and good leadership
of the hon the Minister of Defence and his predecessor, Comrade Modise, as
well as the assistance of the British Military Advisory Training Team. The
integration committee has played a major role. Our integration process has
been so successful after seven years that any future issues can be catered
for within normal SANDF structures.

The integration process of the statutory members has been completed, except
for one administrative matter that relates to the South African identity
documents held by foreign-born members whose citizenship is currently being
verified by the Department of Home Affairs. As far as the integration
process of nonstatutory forces is concerned, this process is also nearing
completion. There are, however, two outstanding issues which need some
attention before the process can be regarded as completed.

The first issue concerns the final intake of those members who have been
given amnesty or who have not yet integrated for some exceptional or other
valid reason. The TRC's amnesty committee has already granted amnesty to a
number of former nonstatutory force members and a number of cases are still
pending. Provision must be made for the integration of these members as
well.

The second issue that needs to be addressed is one that is of concern to
most of the former nonstatutory force members. There is a feeling among
former nonstatutory force members that the integration process was not
really an integration of the former forces but was merely the absorption of
nonstatutory forces into the old SADF. This was so because only former MK
and Apla members were issued with new force numbers, while the old SADF
members retained their old numbers.

The integration process was supposed to mean that all members of the new
SANDF, whether statutory or nonstatutory, were to be issued with new
numbers. It is my wish that the Minister will look into this issue and see
if money cannot be found in this year's budget to implement a process
whereby all members of the old SADF will also get new numbers.

This process will remove any doubts which former nonstatutory armies have
about being integrated into the new SA National Defence Force and not being
absorbed. We must congratulate the Minister of Defence on the good
leadership he has provided in dealing with the question of integration.

We know that the SANDF does not have a lot of money. It must also operate
within a strict budget. In fact, the army has already indicated that it
does not have the capacity, budget or resources to continue handling mass
intakes of nonstatutory force members. It has only budgeted for a final
intake of approximately 300 nonstatutory force members during this
financial year.

The Termination of Integration Intake Bill, together with a constitutional
amendment and an amendment to the Demobilisation Act, which are currently
before Parliament, will bring the integration process to an end. These
Bills will bring down the curtain on a long and difficult process that has
been well managed, given the financial constraints suffered by the SANDF.

The Minister has applied his previous budgets to good effect by building a
ready and competent National Defence Force. I have absolutely no doubt that
he will do so again with this budget.

The ANC supports the Vote. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, hon Minister of Defence, the heads of our
armed forces, I rise on behalf of the PAC to support this Vote and to
salute the armed forces.

I want to reiterate what I said in previous Defence Votes, namely that our
country needs a defence force to defend the people of this nation. The
National Defence Force must be appropriately, or should I say adequately,
equipped for this task. I therefore argue for a balance between the two Ds,
which are defence and development. The army must eat in order to be able to
defend. But the people they defend must also eat, otherwise we may end up
with a war between the defenders and the defended.

Let me add that I believe an army in the modern world has tasks that go
beyond war. These are the responsibilities that touch on peacekeeping
inside and outside the country, helping to defend the country's economic
needs, such as the fishing industry, and helping with development by
constructing bridges and responding to calamities. This calls for a review
of the budget by increasing it rather than cutting it down.

The arms deal has presented this nation with awkward options. The problem
began with an attempt to politicise the whole process. It began when the
alarm was raised. The whistleblower was roundly accused. The messenger, who
was a bearer of bad news, was accused. Her party was also accused. The
truth must be stated again. The arms deal saga did not originate with the
PAC. As a leader of the PAC, I do not even, at this point in time, know the
details of the arms deal. Like the old underground liberation force, we
observe that if too many people know a secret, then that secret cannot be
kept for long.

The PAC is not involved in the arms deal, nor does it have the facts, just
as many members of the ANC also do not have the facts. Some members of the
ANC actually came to me for information. [Interjections.] [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, may I firstly take this opportunity on
behalf of the MF to compliment the Minister and the Defence Force on their
excellent performance. They must keep up the good work. God bless them all.

Siyambonga uNgqongqoshe indlela aphethe ngayo lo Mnyango wezokuVikela. [We
thank the hon the Minister for the way he manages the Department of
Defence.]

Every country aims to provide for the defence and protection of its country
and people in accordance with its Constitution and the principles of
international law. National security is of the utmost importance.
Fortunately, our country enjoys a good relationship with its neighbours.
Our security forces are required for the purpose of keeping peace, to
assist in times of disaster and so on, as it has admirably done in
Mozambique.

The MF fully supports the Government in their noncombative operations, such
as the restoration of law and order, support services to the SA Police
Service and border control on land and sea and in the air. In spite of the
fact that South Africa is not faced with any war situation, the MF very
strongly supports the Government's strategic arms procurement programme,
which is being given a higher priority, as our country has to be always in
a state of preparedness with personnel, defence capabilities, capacity and
operational readiness.

In this respect, the MF welcomes the increase in the Defence budget from
R13,7 billion in the last financial year to R15,8 billion in the year 2001-
02. However, the MF is concerned about the allocation in respect of the
military health support service, where no provision has been made for the
possible implementation of a policy for the treatment of persons suffering
from HIV/Aids-related illnesses. The MF urges the Government to set aside
funds for this purpose. We are also emphasising preventive measures such as
education programmes so that HIV/Aids can be avoided or reduced.

The MF applauds the efforts of our very active Minister of Defence. He
surely does not cause any terror. Our party is pleased that there is an
inquiry into the so-called arms deal. We urge people to allow this process
to continue, so that the country can continue to have confidence in those
who are entrusted with the defence of our country. The MF supports the
Defence budget. [Applause.]

Mr E P MOGALE: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, Deputy Minister, hon members
and distinguished guests, before and after the new democracy, the ANC
leadership, which is the only strategic leadership in the country,
identified people as the main asset of our country. All achievements depend
on the mobilisation, radical transformation, attitudes, and, consequently,
the wellbeing of the people.

The army is the miniature of society in general. Accordingly, our
Government, consistent with our people-centred and people-based policy, has
always taken more care of men and women in uniform. Gen Masondo's report to
the Portfolio Committee on Defence says, and I quote:
  On 23 January 1995, the Cabinet Committee for Security and Intelligence
  Affairs approved the establishment of a Service Corps as a project for
  the RDP, aimed at military personnel, which will grow into an independent
  and predominantly nonmilitary organisation and a committee of Ministers -
  consisting of the Minister of Defence, who was to be the convener, the
  Minister of Education, the Minister of Finance, the Minister without
  Portfolio and the Minister of Public Works - to be established urgently
  to advise the Cabinet on the feasibility of extending the scope of the
  scheme to include other unemployed persons and the so-called marginalised
  youth.

After having a resounding success in integrating forces who had been waging
bloody war against each other, we resolved to carry the integration process
further by taking care of those members, especially from the liberation
forces, who opted for demobilisation. Many of the former freedom fighters
did not necessarily opt for the army as a career. They were volunteers who
responded to a call to defend the people. They volunteered to be part of
the people's army for freedom. Because of their calling, they had to be
taught politics so that they should understand their mission very well.
They were often referred to as the ``armed politicians''. In the case of
MK, this meant progressive and nonracial politics.

While many demobilised soldiers found jobs elsewhere, the Service Corps
scheme remains useful to those who could not and those who continue to
leave the force. Not only the demobilised soldiers would benefit from this
concept. Short-term contractees, members leaving the force due to advanced
age, members who would opt for voluntary severance packages, rationalised
members, etc, would also benefit.

Detractors are looking at the Service Corps in a mechanical way. They look
at the numbers of students that are produced as if that is the only
product. At the moment the Service Corps has 300 people paid from its
coffers. It has a big centre at Elandsfontein called the Centre for
Advanced Training. The centre is fully equipped and offers life-skills and
computer skills. Course materials and manuals were bought and paid for.
Student accommodation is also paid for students. A lot of money was spent
in getting beneficiaries to the centre. Other institutions such as service
providers for the Service Corps were paid for.

The Service Corps has worked and continues to work with the National Youth
Commission. Some people who were on parole were referred to the Service
Corps by the youth commission and were trained there. The Service Corps has
entered into agreement with the Atteridgeville College to train youths in
computer and electrical repairs. Even before a malicious journalist
interviewed Gen Masondo last Friday, already further training for the
youths from the Atteridgeville College had been arranged. An agreement was
also made with the youths in Winterveldt to do projects with the help of
the Department of Social Development to train them to execute their jobs
efficiently.

The whole range of Service Corps training is of strategic importance to the
nation. The placement of former members of liberation armies is to ensure
that one does not let hundreds of people who are trained in arms join the
army of the unemployed. We all know the consequences. Even more important
and exciting was that it was envisaged that the Service Corps would grow
and become a national asset in training all Public Service employees who
are affected by the restructuring and rationalisation that is connected to
the strategic national economic planning and direction. The ANC Government
will continue to drive and manage transformation for nation building.

(Translation of Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[An old African adage used to say: A soldier on the battlefield depends
entirely on water for survival. Modern day survival is no longer dependent
on water; it is linked to budgets. [Applause.]

Recently, a malicious journalist set out to interview Gen Masondo on what
she said was the activities of MK. To his dismay, Gen Masondo was
persistently asked to respond to some obscure statistics which he was not
even asked to clarify beforehand, thus having him critically off balance.
When he hesitated to reply, the malicious journalist, as is always the
case, peremptorily accused him of hiding some facts about the evils
committed by ex-MK veterans. What a shame! People like that journalist are
indeed criminals and we should ignore them. They are just saying things for
the sake of saying them. [Laughter.] One should consider the sacrifices of
the likes of Gen Masondo who worked very hard in establishing
infrastructure on which we are building our nation today.

I am grateful that the hon Deputy Minister has hinted that the issue of
demobilised soldiers and what they can do for survival after leaving the
army is being considered by her department. We need to consider ways and
means of establishing societal agencies to assist the reintegration into
civilian life of those who leave the army. In America army technology has
been brought to civilian life. Since this concept originated in the army
itself, we in South Africa too can utilise it in combating poverty and
unemployment. [Applause.]]

Brig Gen P J SCHALKWYK: Madam Speaker, Minister, Deputy Minister, hon
members, I am going to confine my speech to the position of South African
military veterans who served in the old UDF, the SADF, the armed forces of
the Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei, MK, Apla or the SANDF.

During the war, soldiers are popular and are treated as national heroes,
but as soon as peace comes, they are invariably forgotten. Many of them
risk their lives, endure hardships and are away from their loved ones for
extended periods, and without any meaningful remuneration. In this House, I
know of the hon Middleton, Eglin and Mlangeni who are all World War II
veterans. They received a pittance the day they were demobilised.

We take pride in being former soldiers or former combatants. We are a
unique club and no amount of money can buy one membership of this club. It
is a body born out of the crucible of conflict that preserves that spirit
of camaraderie that we cherish so deeply.

South African veterans are represented at the World Veterans Federation,
whose aim is to build a free and peaceful world, after the suffering of war
and imprisonment. It has a world membership of over 20 million war
veterans, former resistance members, deportees, prisoners of war and
victims of war from the five continents. The credo of this federation is:


  None can speak more eloquently for peace than those who have fought in
  war. The voices of war veterans are a reflection of the longing for peace
  of people the world over. Humanity has earned the right to peace. Without
  it, there can be no hope for the future. And without hope, man is lost.

At the meeting of the general assembly of the World Veterans Federation in
South Korea in 1997, I tabled a motion that was unanimously accepted on the
recognition of the sacrifices made by war veterans and victims of war
worldwide in bringing about and ensuring democratic governance.

I am also very concerned - and the Deputy Minister mentioned this - that we
are neglecting and not promoting our military histories and heritage. I
include all wars and conflicts inside and outside the borders of South
Africa in which South African soldiers and combatants were involved. We
recently experienced a tragedy with the theft of the beautiful bronze
statue commemorating the drowning of 607 black South African soldiers in
1917, during World War I, when the SS Mendi sank in the English Channel.

We welcome the Special Pensions Act, which makes provision for the veterans
involved in their struggle. But what about the thousands of former national
servicemen who were either conscripted or who volunteered to do national
service and extended national service and were obliged to serve in the
citizen force or the commandos for an additional 12 years, without any
opportunity of contributing to a pension fund? We could be sitting on a
time bomb if we are not careful and do not do something about it.

On 18 September last year, I sent a written request to the Minister asking
for an interview with him, to discuss veterans' affairs, but nothing
happened. On 27 April this year, I wrote to the Minister informing him
about the visit of the president of the World Veterans Federation, Mr Hamid
Ibrahim, to South Africa, in late May, suggesting that he meet this
venerable gentleman. He has been entertained by the President of France and
the King of Morocco, and was returning from Nigeria where he met with the
Minister of Defence and his chiefs of staff. The hon the Minister was not
available. Fortunately, the chief of the SANDF was available.

I would like to tell the Minister that I am not so sure whether he is
serious about military veterans' affairs. If he is, then he must initiate
something tangible which will indicate his commitment. South Africa needs
something similar to the Australian veterans' ministry so as to plan for
the integration of veterans into civil society. An agency separate from the
Department of Defence needs to be established very soon.

The Service Corps, as far as I am concerned, looking at the programme last
week, is mismanaged and does not have the capacity to fulfil this. It is
important that the people of South Africa and the South African Government
must not forget our own soldiers. [Applause.]

Ms N N MAPISA-NQAKULA: Madam Speaker, His Excellency the hon the Minister,
Deputy Minister, secretary and members of the defence council present, and
hon members of Parliament, very early in our democratic dispensation the
people of South Africa left nothing to chance. They, through this
Parliament, made sure that strong pillars of democratic practices were
built. Transparency and accountability are amongst those pillars.

Establishing parliamentary oversight committees, including the Joint
Standing Committee on Intelligence, was part of the firm foundation for
good democratic governance. The Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence
exists to make sure that intelligence accounts not only to the executive,
but also to the public through Parliament.

We do our work as prescribed by the Intelligence Services Control Act, No
40 of 1994, as amended. Last week during the budget debate on the civilian
intelligence services, the committee informed this House that the office of
the Inspector-General had got off the ground. This office is one of the
instruments of oversight designed to strengthen the office of the Ministers
who have intelligence responsibilities.

The budget of defence intelligence is incorporated within that of the SA
National Defence Force. The Joint Standing Committee on Defence votes for
this budget, but accountability on the use of that budget with regard to
defence intelligence is to the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence. I
would like to tell the hon the Minister that this anomaly and dilemma that
the legislature finds itself in has to be addressed.

I would like to tell the hon the Minister that the days when military
intelligency was a law unto itself are long gone. All its activities have
to be within the law and be accounted for accordingly. Each rand spent must
yield measurable outcomes. The committee has put it to defence intelligence
that accountability is not only a mere approval of the budget. It is not
about balancing rands and cents, but it is what use the division is able to
put it to.

The committee strives to strike a balance between secrecy and transparency
when dealing with intelligence issues. This is no easy task, but I would
like to tell the hon the Minister that we are managing. However, this
committee will not allow a veil of secrecy to cover issues of clear
mismanagement, maladministration or even abuse of power by defence
intelligence.

The committee has interacted with defence intelligence regarding the budget
and expenditure at least three times this past financial year. In its
budget proposal, defence intelligence is mindful of the country's basic
requirements to improve the poor conditions under which our people live.
Without security, peace, stability and an environment conducive to growth
and investment, the developmental objectives of our country will remain but
a wishful dream. In reviewing the budget, the committee plays its noble
role for the success of good governance in this country.

We congratulate the intelligence division of the Defence Force on being
able to respond to the extraordinary demands that have been placed on it.
South Africa's efforts are acknowledged when we talk about peace in central
Africa. We enjoy relative stability and trust with our neighbours in the
region. However, there are a few issues we would like to mention in this
House concerning defence intelligence.

The military, like all other organs of the apartheid regime, deprived black
people of their rights, career opportunities, job advancement and
beneficial conditions of service. Our people were subjected to unfair
treatment, based on ethnic and social origin, language and political
orientation. It was against this background that the ministerial commission
of inquiry into the transformation of defence intelligence, headed by Judge
Moerane, was instituted, whose primary objective was to investigate and
identify problem areas in the transformation of defence intelligence.
Further, the commission would submit its findings and recommendations to
the executive on how best these problems could be addressed. During this
process there was a very clear understanding that neither movement within,
nor redeployment of officers, would take place until the process had been
concluded.

After the submission of the report to the executive, the executive would
pronounce itself on the report. Regrettably, defence intelligence did not
abide by this decision. Instead, some of the senior officers have expressed
their reservations about the terms of reference of that commission. This,
in our view as the committee, is unacceptable. In the seven years of
democracy in this country, progress in transforming defence intelligence is
still unsatisfactory. For instance, there is no clear human resource
development policy. If it does exist, then it can only be on paper.
Indications are that all is not well.

The view of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence is that, firstly,
the criteria set out for identification of personnel for promotion within
defence intelligence are below standard; and secondly, the division is far
from reflecting the demographics of our country. For us representation is
not the cherry on the top, with the bulk of the historically disadvantaged
at the bottom of the pyramid. Rather, it is about equal representation of
all groups at all levels. [Applause.]

Defence intelligence is not sensitive to the equity and gender policies of
this country. It is a disgrace and, in fact, an indictment of our
Government that there are no women managers in the decision-making echelons
of defence intelligence. Defence intelligence must be in line with the rest
of our Defence Force.

There is no doubt that the old-order tradition of lack of transparency is
still entrenched in defence intelligence. This is evident in the manner in
which personnel issues are dealt with. For example, the senior management
of the division informs us that there are 200 approved posts which have not
been filled for the past three years, the reason being that there are no
suitable candidates in the whole of the SA National Defence Force. In our
view, as the committee, no conscious effort has been made to attract people
to defence intelligence. This situation indicates to us that the philosophy
of defence intelligence management is not in line with the national
objectives.

We had hoped, as the legislature, that the radical dismantling of the old
order would be finished by now. As things stand, we still have a long way
to go. That is why defence intelligence has not yet won the legitimacy and
credibility of the people of our country.

Why defence intelligence? Questions are raised as to why we have an
intelligence division in the Defence Force. Some ask this question out of
sheer ignorance, others, of course, are concerned because of the apartheid
era activities of this institution. Whilst we are politicians, we also have
a responsibility to educate our people.

The executive and Parliament need reliable information when they are making
decisions about sending SA National Defence Force personnel on missions
outside South Africa, including peacekeeping missions. Also defence
intelligence assesses foreign, political and military information, as well
as scientific and technical intelligence for the benefit of our Government,
amongst other things. Therefore, despite the problems raised above, we are
committed to proper resourcing of the entire Defence Force, and we will
support the budget allocated, including the budget being allocated to
defence intelligence.
The Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence, though, calls on the
executive to pronounce itself on the report of the Moerane commission
without further delay. We are making this call precisely because the
recommendations of the commission should be implemented as soon as possible
to avoid some of the problems which currently exist in defence
intelligence.

Our vision as the legislature is to build a society free of prejudices of
any kind against people of South Africa. We call on the defence
intelligence management to work with us for the realisation of this vision.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, I should perhaps start with the
very big point made by the last speaker. With regard to the issues relating
to defence intelligence I need only state that there is a process in motion
now to address these matters. However, it must be considered that the
validity of the comments and observations which have been made requires
that we be more urgent in the matter and very incisive. Once the process
has come to its conclusion, the executive - which includes, of course,
Defence, the Intelligence department, the Presidency and so on, where we
are discussing this at the level of clusters - will be in a position to
present a report as soon as possible.

I should, I think, proceed also to acknowledge the observations and
comments made by hon member Brig Gen Schalkwyk with regard to the issue of
veterans. This is a very important matter. The legislation in place
requires that we act on this matter. I have raised the issue now with some
of the veterans' associations to say that just as much as we have
integrated the forces of the past, the veterans' associations must all come
together. Out of them must now be constituted a national veterans'
association. None of the veterans' associations can expect to access
taxpayer's money unless they are all in a statutory body, established in
terms of a law passed by this Parliament.

There is some foot dragging on both sides. Perhaps I can understand this,
bearing in mind that these are people who come from the old order. The
matter of moving in the new direction, of coming together and working
together, is urgent, because whilst the leadership of the veterans'
associations delay, veterans are suffering the setback of not being able to
access resources and facilities that they would otherwise be entitled to. I
nevertheless wish to assure the hon member Brig Gen Schalkwyk that I will
be putting extra effort into this matter in this year that lies ahead.

Agb Groenewald het die kwessie geopen. Meer spesifiek het hy my gevra of ek
miskien 'n Mercedes-Benz ontvang het of nie. Dit is 'n vraag wat ek nie
verwag het nie, maar ek moet onmiddellik antwoord nee, ek was nie gelukkig
genoeg om 'n Mercedes-Benz te ontvang nie. [Gelag.] In verband met die
vraag wat die agb lid vra, of ek miskien nie die name kan bekendstel van
die mense wat die Mercedes-Benze ontvang het nie, is ek ongelukkig nie in
'n posisie om dit te doen nie. Ek verwag dat die ondersoek wat aan die gang
is die moontlikheid sal skep vir die agentskap wat dit doen om van
DaimlerChrysler die volledige lys van name te kry, en dan bekend te stel
met die einde van hul ondersoek. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[The hon Groenewald opened the matter. More specifically, he asked me
whether or not I had received a Mercedes-Benz. That was a question which I
did not expect, but I must answer immediately that no, I was not fortunate
enough to get a Mercedes-Benz. [Laughter.] With regard to the question
raised by the hon member, whether I could make public the names of the
people who received the Mercedes-Benz vehicles, I am unfortunately not in a
position to do so. I expect that the investigation that is in progress will
create the possibility that the agency dealing with it could obtain a
complete list of names from DaimlerChrysler, and then to make the list
public when they have concluded their investigation.]

Well, I should also acknowledge the fact that Parliament endorsed the
acceptance of the acquisition. No political party, either in Government or
the opposition, has endorsed corrupt practices. The acquisition was not
intended to create an opportunity for corruption. That is why we in the
executive accepted the recommendation of an investigation so that the issue
could be resolved once and for all.

All of us are impatient. We would like the matter to be resolved today or
even yesterday, but unfortunately we have to wait for the process to run
its course. I have no doubt that when the right moment comes, the outcome
of the investigation will be presented to the country and the facts of the
situation will be made known. We must not be too impatient. Our forebears
had a saying: Molato ha o bole. [A debt remains a debt as long as is not
paid off.]
If a crime has been committed, it will not get rotten. It does not matter
when the right moment finally comes, there will always be men and women
here to deal with it. Fortunately this will not take as long as all that.
In a very short space of time we will get the final verdict on this issue.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Why are you so frightened of me? [Interjections.]

The MINISTER: No, please, let us just calm down. We are not afraid of any
individual.

We are pursuing the matter and the investigation is going on. If there is a
suggestion anywhere in this country, or in this House, that the democracy-
supporting agencies that we have set up and which are now dealing with this
matter are not competent to do so, we should pass a vote here and set in
place structures that we are satisfied will be able to do it.

The suggestion that only the Special Investigating Unit can do this job - I
repeat, that only it can do this job - implies that the other agencies are
part of the corruption. That is the one point. The second point is, if I
can ask the hon Ms Smuts to be patient, that the Special Investigating
Unit, in my understanding, has a specific role. That is why it acts only on
the specific instructions of the President.

The Unit was set up to recover money where it was established that
Government has lost money. It was set up as an arm that would have the
power to go and seek to recover money lost to Government. That has been my
understanding. As far as I am concerned, as soon as and whenever it can be
established that in this deal Government lost money, in this contract or
any other contract, I can see no reason why we would avoid asking the
President to charge the Special Investigating Unit with the task of
recovering such money.

But there is legislation. We cannot pass a law here and say this body is
set up for this purpose and then want to use it for something else. I think
we are misleading ourselves, that is my reasoning. So, in so far as that
situation is concerned, there is no exclusion of the Special Investigating
Unit, but, when the time is ripe, we will arrive at that point.
[Interjections.] May I pass that point?

Ek wil terugkeer na die agb Groenewald. Die indruk wat geskep is dat ek na
die basisse sal gaan om dáár moeilikheid te gaan veroorsaak, is onregverdig
en ongegrond. [I want to come back to the hon Groenewald. The impression
that was created, that I would go to bases to go and make trouble there, is
unjust and unfounded.]

I will not run the SA National Defence Force from the comfort and shining
windows of the Armscor building. When I learn that there are problems in
any base in this country, I will go there. I have the chiefs here who
initially provided me with reports of developments in the various bases in
which incidents took place, but I can tell hon member in their presence
that, in the case of Phalaborwa, for instance, the commanding officer there
lied to the chiefs. When I pursued the false report, he lied to me.

Since I am not unable to move around this country, I flew there, and then I
began to do an inspection in loco with officers and the commander himself
present. He began to tell a different story from the one on the document he
had sent to me in Pretoria. It was out of the mouth of the commanding
officer that the falseness of his report, both to the chiefs and to me,
became clear. In such circumstances, I understood the position well, and
hon members would have understood better had they been there.

Ek besef toe onmiddellik wat die probleem is. Wanneer iemand wat betrokke
is in die Weermag, op enige vlak van ons Suid-Afrikaanse leer, 'n
gesindheid het wat sê: ``Ek is die baas en jy is die `kaffer''', gaan dit
probleme veroorsaak. Dit kan ek verstaan. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek verstaan dit
baie goed. Die probleem in daardie stadium was nie 'n kwessie dat die
waarheid, of die inligting, nie beskikbaar was nie, dit was die feit dat
die Hoof van die Weermag en die Minister ``kaffers'' was. Dit was die
posisie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die hele atmosfeer in daardie basis, insluitende
die vloekery wat daar plaasgevind het, het daarop gedui dat die situasie
heeltemal ongesond was. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I realised immediately what the problem was. When someone who is involved
in the Defence Force, at any level of the South African army, has an
attitude saying: ``I am the boss and you are the `kaffir''', then it will
cause problems. That I can understand. [Interjections.] I understand that
very well. The problem in that situation was not a question of the truth,
or the information, not being available, it was the fact that the Chief of
the Defence Force and the Minister were ``kaffirs''. That was the position.
[Interjections.] The whole atmosphere on that base, including the swearing
that took place there, indicated that the situation was entirely
unhealthy.]

I did something about it. I did not take action against some insignificant
people. I said to the chiefs that something had to be done about that
individual who, in my view, did not qualify under our Constitution to lead
the men and women in that base. What they did was not my business, but
after that, right there and then, I addressed the attitude of the whites,
and that of the blacks.

The problem this country faces is not that of whites alone. There are
whites going around with wrong, negative attitudes of the past, but there
are also blacks who are guilty of similar weak behaviour. [Interjections.]
Hon members can look at the copies of the speeches that I delivered there,
or listen to the tapes that were made when I made the addresses, and they
will find that there is not a single individual, of any category, whom I
did not rap over the knuckles.

I am proud to say that I can go back to Phalaborwa tomorrow, or to
Pietersburg, Nelspruit, Durban or any of the bases where I was, and none of
the members of the SANDF will be able to say that I went there to take
sides. They will say that I told them: ``Die dae van baasskap is verby.''
[The days of ``baasskap'' are over.] But at the same time, none of those
people, even if they are my cousins, who are black like me, are entitled to
disobey and to behave like lords in the base. Every one of us has to
observe the discipline of the institution. The SANDF is a military
institution. Commands must be given. They must be carried out if they are
lawful, but if they are not lawful commands, they cannot be obeyed.
[Applause.]

I should perhaps briefly return to the issue of the treatment of the
returning fighters who came from the liberation movement, because it is a
very sensitive issue. It is not correct, I submit, to suggest that nothing
has been done about the issue. Apart from work that was done by the
political parties of those fighters in Government, all of those who did not
want to become members of the SANDF were given an opportunity, either to
serve or to take demobilisation.

The ones who were on the certified registers received that treatment, the
ones who were not were incorporated in the SANDF. At the present moment,
and legislation has been passed here, we are working at addressing the
issue of unequal pensions for those who are still serving. But we are going
beyond that, because we are now considering looking at what to do about
some who may not have been so well attended to as we might have wished.

This country and the Cabinet of this country work with a budget that is
limited. Today we can do some things. Tomorrow we will be able to do
others. The question that I was raising with regard to veterans, for
instance, could not have been dealt with right at the beginning. But now
that there are some resources we can deal with the matter.

We are dealing with these issues step by step. Hon members, as this
Parliament, receive recommendations from the executive and they are able,
therefore, given the limited budget we have before us, to decide whether
the recommendations we make are right or not. I will be approaching members
on more occasions with further recommendations with regard to how to deal
with these issues.

However, with regard to some of the caricatures I saw on Sunday, when Gen
Masondo was talking about the issue to Debra Patta, who took
demobilisation? Their names are there. They got money and now they sit
before the TV people, with a bottle of brandy going around, and say that
they have been completely betrayed and so on. This is the kind of thing I
am not prepared to accept.

Gen Masondo, since he came here, has been part of the process of mobilising
funds, as a member of the ANC, within the ANC. He mobilised, within the
Government, for those who were members of the ANC, more than R70 million
under demobilisation pension payouts. He is dealing with all these things
that we are talking about.

The last point I want to make is that I am sorry to hear some of the
rumours about the late lieutenant who is about to be buried. Nobody, not
even the Deputy Minister, who is a relative of the deceased, has raised the
matter with me before. But I have raised the matter with the officers.
When he fell ill he had a fatal tumour about which nothing could be done.
We had him in our military hospital in Pretoria. We received a request,
through the good offices of the hon Thandi Modise, who is the chairperson
of the defence committee, and he was airlifted from there to bring him
closer to his family here in Cape Town because the Deputy Minister is here,
and he was kept in the military hospital here too. As I say, it was a fatal
situation. Nothing could be done. He was a terminal case and died there. We
are trying to meet all the obligations we would like to meet in relation to
the matter.

I must say that members of the SA National Defence Force are receiving
treatment in our hospitals. I and my family receive treatment in the same
hospitals. I do not get any better treatment than they get. We are all
receiving the same treatment and I do that because I want to keep track of
how our military hospitals are performing.

I am not saying they are perfect. I think there is room for improvement and
we are discussing how to improve that. Even where there is need and
necessity to find partnerships with the private sector, we are working on
these issues. But we are very proud of the services we are giving in the
light of this budget that we are given by the Government. We know how this
nation is concerned about the matter, and I do not think there is much that
should be complained about.

I nevertheless followed the matter up because I wanted to make sure that we
know precisely what happened, where the mishap may have been. [Applause.]

Debate on Vote No 16 - Housing:

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Madam Speaker, hon members, distinguished guests,
ladies and gentlemenÿ.ÿ.ÿ.

... sishova ingolovane, sixova udaka, sakha izindlu, sakha isizwe. [... we
are pushing the wheelbarrow, we are mixing the mortar, we are building
houses and we are building a nation.]

Re tšhofa kiriba. [We are mixing the mortar.]

Hi pfuva ridaka, hi aka tindlu, hi aka rixaka. [We are mixing the mortar,
building houses and building a nation.]

The lack of housing is the most visible expression of cumulative poverty, a
characteristic of physically and socially degraded areas. Most of the time
this leads to other problems, such as social exclusion. Processes that
perpetuate poverty flourish under conditions of want, and result in
unemployment, illiteracy, failure in school, and eventually the phenomenon
of school dropouts occurs. Drug addiction and low income plague individuals
living in such conditions.

There is, therefore, a close correlation between housing and the social
environment.

Housing needs have a qualitative aspect that relates to the insufficiency
of housing in terms of numbers, the suitability for families and how
housing is acquired and for how much. The qualitative aspect is translated
into a lack of habitability, such as overcrowded occupation, the sharing of
a small dwelling by more than one family, as in KwaMashu, KwaZulu-Natal,
and the extreme degradation of buildings and their lack of safety.

It is with this understanding that we have approached the issue of housing
in our environment. We have put in place a policy and supporting
legislation. We have planned our programmes that meet the national goals,
taking into consideration the local and specific requirements of housing.
The poor remain our primary target group.

As I stand before hon members, 5 million South Africans who did not have a
roof over their heads will return at the end of today to a place they call
home, and will have running water and sanitation, which they did not have
before we embarked on this journey. [Applause.] This is a journey travelled
by very few, if any, in the world, a journey to build 1,129 million houses
in the six years of this democratic ANC-led Government, a journey that
traversed the slippery slopes of consolidating more than 10 different
housing departments that existed in 1994, fragmented policies and 34 pieces
of legislation. This journey took us through the potholes of reluctance by
financial institutions to extend credit to previously marginalised
communities, through redlining, and through defusing the land mines of
fraud, corruption and criminal activity.

So far we have, indeed, come, but we are still faced with daunting
challenges, albeit different from those we faced at the beginning of this
journey. Then, it was how to provide houses; today we assess the impact of
HIV/Aids on housing. Then, it was what subsidy mechanism to introduce; now
it is how to promote a savings culture to augment the housing subsidies.
Then, it was where to build new houses; today it is how to eradicate
informal settlements. Then, it was introducing a new policy and
administrative procedures; today it is policy enhancements and the review
of administrative procedures to improve efficiency. On this journey we have
learnt by doing and have a true success story to tell, because by not doing
there can never be learning or progress.

Estimates by Statistics SA in the year 2000 indicate that approximately
53,6% of our population lives in urban areas. This is as a result of
natural population growth and rural-to-urban migration. This has been
exacerbated by inappropriate policies, a skewed distribution of resources
and wealth, and the general pull factors of growing economies and cities.

South Africa is not unique, as our developing counterparts of Latin
America, Asia and our African continent experience the phenomenon of
informal settlements. As a result of the shortage of adequate and available
shelter, people occupy any vacant land they can find, and they put up
shacks in areas without sanitation, infrastructure or social amenities.
Others occupy old, disused and/or abandoned structures, or prefabricated
buildings of inferior material that are in an advanced stage of decay, with
very deficient safety or habitability standards.

Informal settlements have mushroomed mainly because of inadequate resource
allocation for housing during the apartheid era. This has resulted in a
huge backlog, inappropriate policies such as the homeland policies and the
Group Areas Act, a lack of adequate land for the majority in the country
and a lack of available land for settlement by the poor in the inner cities
where there is employment and economic opportunities. That history is still
with us.

Not enough land exists for low-cost housing in the inner cities. Where it
does, the costs are exorbitant. The Department of Land Affairs and other
departments which manage land are currently looking at ways of dealing with
this problem. Unique to our country is the fact that most land is in
private ownership and most land occupied illegally is unsuitable for
development. This means that the in situ upgrading of informal settlements
is seldom possible, requiring the acquisition of new land and the
relocation of communities. Despite these difficulties, I am happy to report
to this House that our informal upgrading programme has resulted in a total
of 293 projects, providing shelter to 232 000 families who have had their
shacks in informal settlements converted into proper homes across the
country.

In response to the President's prioritisation of the urban renewal
programme, the department has led the way with the implementation of the
Alexandra Urban Renewal Programme, with R3,5 million used for feasibility
studies and planning work. In KwaMashu in excess of R20 million has been
allocated for redevelopment, over two years, through our Human Settlement
Redevelopment Programme.

Where land has been available in the inner city, the Department of Housing
has implemented programmes that have drawn low-income earners into the
inner cities. Through the institutional subsidy, a subprogramme of our
capital housing subsidy scheme, 70 medium-density housing projects, which
comprise 33 935 housing units, have been concluded in the provinces.
[Applause.] The number of housing units which have been planned for the
financial year 2001-02 is 16 638.

The institutional subsidy has been utilised by the department as an
instrument to combine the Government subsidy and private-sector funding. We
have had remarkable support from governments abroad and some NGOs through
grant funding. Medium-density development is more costly and requires
professional management through social housing associations. The
implementation process for the institutional subsidy mechanism requires
structuring of partnerships, which is normally complex and time-consuming,
and additional investment by the private sector at project level, with
financial models unique to each project.

Even more difficult is the establishment of the institutions and the
capacity-building of new members of social housing issues, to the extent
that the institution is viable and fully operational. The result is that
medium-density housing and social housing projects have lead times of more
than one year. Project-linked subsidy projects, on the other hand, which
have been our main subprogramme of delivery, have a seven-month lead time,
and no requirement for institutional establishment and inherent capacity-
building.

There are several housing associations in the country that are functioning
at optimal level, but more will be needed when more stock is delivered. The
R16 000 subsidy is directly invested in the property and not linked to the
individual recipient, to allow for mobility. Through this programme, we
also provide for rental to ownership within the same projects to
accommodate those who would wish to own.

Social housing, however, is a new concept to South Africa. Prior to 1994,
these institutions did not exist at all. More importantly, we introduced
the institutional subsidy in December 1995 to facilitate social housing.
Later in 1997 we established the Social Housing Foundation, in partnership
with the Dutch government, to promote social housing. We have also utilised
abandoned buildings by transforming them into high-density housing through
the renovation of existing flats or the conversion of commercial or office
buildings into housing units through the institutional housing subsidy
programme. In other cases we have developed disused infill sites for medium-
density housing, all contributing to inner city regeneration. Transitional
housing development is used to accommodate persons temporarily before they
move on to more permanent accommodation.

The housing policy has, as its central thrust, security of tenure. To date
about 350 000 families enjoy secure tenure through our programme of
transferring old rental stock for ownership. In addition, 1,129 million
families currently benefit from our programme that provides housing with
security of tenure. This government has chosen that route as a way of
bringing dignity to our people, but also because, of all elements of the
right to housing, it is the right to security of tenure that forms the most
indispensable core element. When security of tenure - the right to feel
safe in one's own home, to control one's own housing environment and not to
be arbitrarily forcibly evicted - is threatened or simply nonexistent, it
jeopardises the full employment of housing rights.

It is important to know that securing tenure for a household does not
necessarily secure tenure for women and children, unless the principle of
gender equality is adhered to. The principle of human rights, therefore,
should be respected and all persons should be treated equally and should
enjoy security of tenure. This in itself is empowerment of the
disadvantaged.

Providing a house with secure tenure assists the poor to establish a
foothold in the urban economy. A house provides a place where people can
study and improve their lives, whilst moving out of the web of poverty,
especially when the low-income areas are functional. The house can be put
up as collateral to access credit. To date, the transfer of council houses
for ownership has created an asset base of about R28 billion.

The construction of RDP houses has empowered emerging contractors to create
jobs around their projects. Many of our people have now acquired skills
they did not have before through our capacity- building programmes run by
tertiary institutions in every province and through our technical support
at the support centres. The multiplier effects of our projects have also
boosted local economies and SMME development. Skills developed in our
communities include brickmaking, windowmaking, microbuilding, fencemaking,
plastering, roofing and wall and floor tiling.

We proudly speak of women developers and contractors who entered the
construction industry to build, but also to earn a living through
construction. After an evaluation of women's involvement in the sector was
conducted, it was discovered that few projects are given to women. In order
to reverse this, our housing Minmec committed itself to ensuring that
provinces give at least 10% of their subsidies to women developers and
contractors. It was made clear that there will be no tolerance for rented
female faces. Genuine participation is what we are bent on promoting, not
fronting.

We further passed through this House the Housing Amendment Bill, which will
prevent the sale of subsidised housing to private individuals. It
introduces a pre-emptive clause on the title deed of every subsidised house
and makes provision for sale only to provincial governments, in order for
the property to be reallocated to other beneficiaries on the waiting lists.
This also prohibits the auctioning of subsidised housing by local
governments and ensures that one arm of Government does not undermine the
efforts of another.

On Sunday, on e-tv, we heard of the case of a Ms Payne from Paarl, who was
evicted from a subsidised house she was renting. It is unclear why she was
evicted, but it was crystal clear that she was renting from a landlord who
owned the subsidised house. These are new emergent trends that we are
investigating to ensure that subsidised housing is used for the intended
purposes and that we eliminate any unintended consequences of our policies.
We are committed to creating diverse choices for our people within the
framework of the housing programme.

More importantly, this indicates a growing demand for rental housing. We
shall continue to focus our delivery programme on rental housing in line
with the Rental Housing Act of 1999. We will endeavour to implement the
Presidential Jobs Summit housing pilot projects, which will result in the
development of 50 000 to 150 000 rental housing units over a period of
three years, drawing on private-sector investment.

Despite the efforts of Government, access to finance still remains the
greatest challenge to low-cost housing development. Since 1994 this
Government has established four housing finance institutions to normalise
the housing finance lending environment. To date, these institutions have
recorded the following progress: Prior to its closure in 1998, the Mortgage
Indemnity Fund facilitated the resumption of lending, with 15 financial
institutions accredited and indemnity cover in 543 areas in the country. A
total of 140 000 loans were granted to the value of R10 billion, of which
only R4,1 billion was in the subsidised market.

The National Housing Finance Corporation last year alone disbursed R741
million for end-user finance to facilitate 150 330 loans. Servcon, on the
other hand, out of an original portfolio of 33 319 properties, now has 23
203 properties. They had signed 19 467 agreements by the end of April of
this year, which constitutes 69,7% of the total portfolio, against the
target of 70%. The National Urban Reconstruction and Housing Agency,
Nurcha, has to date signed guarantees to the value of R171,1 million and
raised R290,5 million in working capital finance. This has facilitated 69
965 housing units. This institution also has a new mandate of mobilising
saving for housing purposes.

This House facilitated the enactment of the Home Loan and Mortgage
Disclosure Act late last year. This legislation is intended to ensure that
we monitor the lending patterns of financial institutions and all lenders
in the housing finance sector. It is intended to eliminate redlining, a
discriminatory practice by banks not to lend to marginalised communities.
It will force banks to disclose the reasons for not advancing a home loan
or mortgage and will ensure the elimination of discrimination based on
reasons other than sound financial underwriting criteria.

During this year I will be presenting to the Cabinet the next phase of this
intervention, the Community Reinvestment Bill, which will aim to promote
investment by the private sector in marginalised communities, through
identifying causal deterrents for investments and creating incentives and
disincentives for future investments. As we look forward to the ongoing
challenge of housing the nation, we have renewed our commitment to
providing housing at scale whilst focusing more on qualitative aspects of
housing delivery. We compare this to the previous term of Government.

Our engagements in the international area are set out in Annexure B. They
aim to broaden our influence and the sharing of best practices in policy
and programme implementation. Our efforts locally will ensure better
planning and budgeting in the context of the MTEF, to promote efficient
management to eliminate maladministration and mismanagement and to prevent
subsidy fraud through the improvement of subsidy administrative systems.

Having thus shared with the House what lies ahead of us, we once again roll
up our sleeves for another year. We are already hard at it to house the
homeless people of our country. I would like to thank all those who have
made this journey a success: the provincial MECs for housing, department
officials, the housing institutions, members of the portfolio committee and
the study groups, active members of our communities who are here with us
today, NGOs and everybody who has lent a hand to make sure that we change
the character and the nature of South African human settlements.
[Applause.]
Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, housing development in South Africa has played
a powerful unifying role in bringing disadvantaged people together in
extremely difficult circumstances. The DA believes that the benefits of
state housing assistance should reach as many homeless people as possible.
By giving people ownership of the land and assistance in building their own
houses, we are creating a national and also a personal pride that is needed
to restore the moral fibre of our people. Housing development serves as an
engine for economic growth, providing jobs, skills and business
opportunities in the private sector and jobs for all. Ownership of a house
and land is a route to finance.

A million dwellings have been built. Measured against the number of
subsidies allocated, one should consider congratulating this Government on
its achievements. Building over a million houses in just over five years is
by any standards no mean achievement. But, if one takes a closer look at
these dwellings and ignores the propaganda being spread by Government, then
any patriot becomes concerned.

On a recent visit by the Portfolio Committee on Housing, the following
problems were highlighted. In the Northern Province the Department does not
have sufficient funds to capacitate and train developers. There are some
squatter camps in the area, especially in rural towns, and the department
has some difficulties in addressing them. The national Government has not
been responding properly as regards the flood disaster experienced in
February 2000. The department needs a policy on disaster management to be
able to address the plight of communities when they experience disasters.

There are tensions between traditional leaders and new local government
systems. The Department of Labour does not make a follow-up on trained
people after the projects are completed to ensure that they are employed
elsewhere. No certificates are given to the trained people.

Die DA is gebore uit gesonde verstand en 'n diep gevoel van patriotisme.
Die DA se patriotisme strek verder as net die vlag en die volkslied. Dit is
'n patriotisme wat mense nie net bloot as stemvee beskou wat af en toe met
krummels van die ANC-base se tafels gelukkig moet wees nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is nie goed genoeg nie dat die armes slegs gevoed
word wanneer die begroting goedgekeur word en 'n klein groepie na dié ete
genooi word. Dit is nie voldoende nie dat 'n paar werkloses 'n paar dae
lank teen hongerlone moet werk wanneer die Minister 'n plek besoek of 'n
projek van stapel stuur. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The DA was born out of sound common sense and a deep feeling of
patriotism. The DA's patriotism goes beyond the flag and the national
anthem. It is a patriotism that does not regard people as mere voting
cattle who should be happy with a few crumbs from the tables of the ANC
bosses every now and again. [Interjections.] It is not good enough that the
poor are only fed when the budget is approved and a small group is invited
to this meal. It is not sufficient that only a few jobless people should
work for a starvation wage for a couple of days whenever the Minister
visits a place or launches a project.]

When I address the poor of this country, in cities and in rural areas, they
want to know what happened to the promises that were made to them during
the struggle under the leadership of the liberation movement.
[Interjections.] I was part of a detachment of student activists that asked
the people of this country to sacrifice their houses, their families and
their lives. Most were willing to give their lives for liberation. We
promised people we would build better houses than the four-roomed houses of
the apartheid government. What has been built are one-roomed dwellings for
families consisting of six to ten members. Roofs are leaking, and the
Minister should have been here with an umbrella, not a hard hat. Many left
their new houses and went back to the informal settlement and the
"mikhukhus" because they were much more spacious than the little
decentralised hostels.

The question arises: Would it not have been better if the citizens had been
told beforehand what size and quality of houses they were going to receive
so that they could have had reasonable expectations? A recent study on
housing rights funded by the Foundation for Human Rights and performed by
the Built Environment Support Group shows that the right of South Africans
to access adequate housing, as entrenched in the Constitution, is not being
properly realised. In fact, it further states that if South Africa's
housing initiatives are not improved, this will create an additional
health, security, educational and environmental burden for the state. We
promised that the doors of learning shall be opened to all. The only open
doors are those classrooms where the doors have been stolen for firewood or
by vandals to sell in informal settlements.

As part of a detachment of unionists, I asked workers to participate in
union actions in supporting strikes and consumer boycotts. [Interjections.]

The ANC led us to believe that by wrenching the power from the capitalists
in their ivory towers, the people would gain ownership of the means of
production. The sweet fruits of liberation should be tasted by all. We have
been lied to. The elite of the ANC have one hand on the levers of power in
Government and in the private sector and the other hand in their own
pockets. The patriots of this country are still poor. They are still
unemployed and oppressed, but this time by their own leaders. The ANC are
patriots for the elite. Only they enjoy the fruits of liberation.

Die DA se begrip van patriotisme behels dat 'n regering vir die mense werk
en nie net vir 'n paar van hulle nie. DA-patriotisme behels dat 'n regering
die welsyn van sy mense op die hart dra. Dit behels dat die Regering 'n
plig het om kwaliteitonderwys, kwaliteitgesondheidsdienste en
kwaliteitbehuising te lewer, nie eenvertrekkwartiere sonder ventilasie en
plafonne, waarvan die mure kraak en vog deur die mure en fondasies insypel
nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The DA's concept of patriotism entails that a government works for the
people and not only for a few of them. DA patriotism entails that a
government will have the welfare of its people at heart. This entails that
the Government has a duty to provide quality education, quality health
services and quality housing, not one-roomed units without ventilation and
ceilings, the walls of which are cracking and with damp seeping in through
the walls and foundations.]

How can parents raise their families in one room, where there is no privacy
between parent and child? How can students study in housing units that
serve as decentralised hostels for single men and at houses that can become
homes? All this while an expatriate, Coleman Andrews, earns nearly R700
million in less than three years. This from taxpayers' money.

In stede daarvan dat die ANC almal wat met hulle verskil, uitskel, moet
hulle eerder begin om 'n diepgaande selfondersoek te doen en na hulle eie
toenemende onvermoë om 'n effektiewe regering te wees kyk. [Instead of
quarrelling with everyone that disagrees with them, the ANC should rather
conduct a thorough introspection and examine their own increasing inability
to be an effective government.]

The ANC should note the worrying signs of civil disobedience all across the
country, where communities burn railway stations and march against ANC
councillors and premiers, as has happened in Soweto and the Northern Cape.

Die DA is die skild wat die mense van Suid-Afrika sal beskerm teen 'n ANC-
regering wat korrupsie toesmeer en belastingbetalersgeld verkwis.
[Tussenwerpsels.] [The DA is the shield that will protect the people of
South Africa against an ANC government that covers up corruption and wastes
the taxpayers' money. [Interjections.]]

Ms N E HANGANA: Madam Speaker, Minister of Housing, comrades and members of
Parliament, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the housing
community of the Western Cape. [Applause.]

We have represented here the Unicity of Cape Town - councillors who work on
housing issues - Habitat for Humanity, rent tribunal nominees, the
Community Housing Company, the provincial legislature, housing NGOs, the
Development Action Group, the Homeless People's Federation, the People's
Dialogue, the former provincial housing boards - we did away with the
housing boards - the media, anti-eviction campaign organisers, evicted
families and those facing eviction ... [Applause.] ... senior developers
and many others. These community members have come here today to listen to
the DA and what it intends doing for the poor of this province. These
people are here to listen very carefully to the DA's message to them.

Housing delivery in the last seven years has satisfactorily addressed the
housing needs of the poor within an environment plagued by socioeconomic
challenges. Employment and low wages have substantially affected
affordability levels in the housing sector. However, the Government has
designed a number of strategies to address these challenges, which include,
firstly, an infrastructure investment approach to stimulate the economy in
both rural and urban areas; secondly, urban renewal strategies to upgrade
public infrastructure and to boost local economic development; and thirdly,
the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Strategy to enhance the
quality of life of the rural poor.

Sustainable urban development is one of the most pressing challenges facing
the human community in the 21st century. The world's urban areas are now
home to nearly half of humankind. Housing markets for the urban poor vary
greatly from country to country.

Women are seen as an underutilised asset for development. It is assumed
that the increase in economic activity will, in and of itself, lead to
increased equity. In the efficiency approach, women's unpaid time is used
as a self-help component in economic activities, specifically with respect
to human resources development and for the management of community
problems. It assumes that women's unpaid labour in areas such as child
care, fuel gathering, food processing, the preparation of meals and nursing
the sick, is elastic. For this reason, notions of empowering women by
increasing control over their own lives, strengthening their capacity and
enlarging their choices are more appropriate.

Empowerment is about recognising that grass-roots inputs to plans and
projects are vital and that gender-aware planning principles should be
opened to sympathetic and imaginative interpretation in different contexts.
Speaking about empowerment, just a few weeks ago the Cape Town Unicity,
under the leadership of the Democratic Alliance, announced an across-the-
board rates increase. Due to the imposition of the Group Areas Act over a
30-year period, three differentiated property markets developed within Cape
Town. Following the demise of the Group Areas Act and the normalisation of
the land market, these properties should experience significant relative
adjustments in their rates.

Property values in historically white group areas have escalated without an
equivalent increase in rates, thus further increasing the distortion in
property rates relative to their current market values. Certain properties,
like those on the Blouberg beachfront, for example, have experienced
substantial escalations in price compared to areas such as Mitchells Plain,
Belville South and Macassar, that have not attracted the same level of
demand and have not benefited from significant levels of property price
escalation.

We have gone past the elections, and we are now beginning to see the true
colours of the Democratic Alliance. This across-the-board increase of 7%
will put a further financial burden on the poor and the unemployed.
[Applause.] The DA-led council has also failed to introduce a single
approach to rebates for the elderly and disabled. The ANC is again warning
the voters out there that the DA does not care for the poor, and has no
history of caring for the poor of this country.

Right across the poor communities in the Western Cape, evictions are taking
place on a daily basis. The New NP should be ashamed of having misled these
communities to vote for the DA. Some of those people voted for the
Democratic Alliance in the last elections. I can assure hon members that
these evictions would not be taking place if elections were going to take
place next year. The ANC, throughout its history - outside government, and
now in government - has always defended and protected the poor from either
forced removals or evictions from their homes. That is why we have put in
place housing institutions to enable the Government to have bilateral talks
with our people instead of literally throwing people out into the streets.

Communities in Lavender Hill, Belhar, Delft, Joe Slovo and Albow Gardens
have received eviction notices. In Albow Gardens 100 families have received
eviction notices; in Sandrift, 18 families; and in Joe Slovo, 20 families.
In Du Noon the evictions were suspended through the intervention of Sanco.
When the residents called upon the DA councillor to come and help them she
refused, saying that she had 13 000 other people to look after.
[Interjections.] Such are their councillors! It was again through the
intervention of Comrade Tony Yengeni, the MP for the area, that the
evictions in the poor areas of Milnerton flats did not materialise.

Why did the DA wait until after the elections to carry out these evil
deeds? What does the unicity mean for the poor working class communities?
It means, firstly, that instead of low rates for the poor, the unicity
decides on a 7% increase across the board; secondly, that instead of
scrapping the arrears and stopping the evictions, the unicity applies to
the courts to evict thousands of poor people; and, thirdly, that instead of
free water, people are told to pay the bills first before they can get free
water.

Peter Marais has been hard at work trying to build his image in the media.
He has been making a lot of noise about his strategies on how he will get
rid of the shacks on the N2 and remove the community to Delft South. Why
did they not identify an area nearer to town, where those people work? Why
did they shove them there on the periphery? Why do they promote the old
apartheid Group Areas Act? When is this province going to implement the
integrated approach? In Peter Marais' media stunt, he is very silent on the
massive evictions taking place in the unicity.

The MEC for housing, Mr Herandien, should instead look into the corrupt
members of the provincial administration's housing ministry who manage
blocks of low-cost flats in Parow where people pay as little as R180 a
month for a three-bedroomed flat. Peter Marais has five family members
living in that complex - his son-in-law and his sisters-in-law. It is
believed that his three sisters-in-law own property elsewhere. Again, it is
believed that another relative of Peter Marais lives at Parow Park.
Mr Herandien has refused to act, demanding proof first. The proof is for Mr
Herandien to investigate. We must first find out why there are so many
relatives of Mr Marais living in that complex. Talk about nepotism! Those
flats are meant for the poor, and about 80% of the people living in them do
not meet the criteria.

Lastly, the ANC Government has always shown compassion towards the needs of
the poor. We are committed to that today, we will be committed to that
tomorrow and we will be committed to that forever. [Applause.]

Mr B W DHLAMINI: Madam Speaker, hon members, when I was growing up, there
was a popular song which went thus:

Zingaba buhlungu zonke izinto emhlabeni kodwa hhayi njengokuswela indawo
yokulala. [Ubuwelewele.] [Anything can be painful in this world, but there
is nothing more painful than having no place to sleep. [Interjections.]]

One needs to be dark-skinned in this country to fully understand the
meaning of this song. When, therefore, 1994 dawned on South Africa,
millions of our people who had literally lived in conditions which were
worse than those of white-owned dogs  became hopeful that at last their
woes had come to an end. It is with this in mind that I rise on behalf of
the IFP to support the Housing Vote. It is with this awareness that I wish
to articulate the IFP's contribution to this debate.

The IFP welcomes the steps which the Department of Housing has taken to
improve the conditions of the homeless African majority and other South
African citizens. The department's shift from quantity to quality in its
housing programmes is appreciated. While it is true that South Africa needs
millions of housing units to be able to satisfy the demand for houses, it
would not be wise to sacrifice quality for the sake of attaining high
numbers.

The war against homelessness is a South African war. It must be fought by
all South Africans as part of a broader struggle for the ultimate
realisation of complete liberation. It demands the same commitment which
millions of our people have. We note, with sadness, that some of the
banking institutions, as well as credit bureaux, do not view this as their
war. They must be reminded that they are not doing the homeless any
favours. They should either swim or sink with the whole of the country.
They, like all of us, must ensure that this fledging democracy survives.
The country expects them to play a meaningful role in levelling the playing
field so that our people have access to credit and loans to build houses.

To take this struggle further, I would like to urge the department and the
Minister to review the notion that a serviced site costs R7 500 and that
the balance is for the top structure and the professional fee. I believe
that with the sum of R17 000 as a subsidy, some developers are able to
produce structures of better quality than the houses we produce at the
moment. An actual example of this is to be found in the Northern Province,
where they produce a 52m2 quality house.

The development of residential areas must form part of the integrated
development strategy of the Government. Intertwined with the development of
a residential area must be the development of industrial infrastructure.
This will help in job creation for local residents. It will also save them
from travelling long distances to shops and places of work.

The IFP congratulates the Minister of Housing on having introduced the
Housing Amendment Bill of 2000 to regulate the sale of state-subsidised
houses. We believe, like the Minister, that housing backlogs will not be
eliminated if people are liberally allowed to economically speculate with
their state-subsidised houses.

Corruption is a cancer that threatens whatever good intentions Government
may have. It is slowly entrenching itself as another culture in our
society. The IFP therefore welcomes any effort to fight the scourge of
corruption. It is for this reason that we applaud the initiative of the
Department of Housing to establish an investigation unit to fight this
disease. We are aware of allegations of corruption by Government officials
and individuals parading as community leaders, who are involved in
allocating houses to the poor.

The IFP observes with some concern that the housing policy is biased
towards the urban areas. Unless Government adopts a conscious and
deliberate programme to ensure that there is deliberate housing development
in rural areas, we shall continue to grapple with the housing problem
because rural people will realise, if they have not already done so, that
salvation lies in building shacks in the cities. More shacks will mean
health hazards and skepticism by potential investors with their perceptions
of crime.

What further complicates the problem of rural housing is the unfinished
business between Government and traditional leaders. This matter is bound
to impact negatively on rural housing programmes, because the reality is
that we need the co-operation of traditional leaders to successfully
execute these rural housing programmes.

It is ironic that here in South Africa, a country which is at the forefront
of the African Renaissance, institutions which are not African by origin
find more acceptance and attention than those that are home-made. Prof
Herbert Vilakazi highlights this as a problem facing Africa in his book
entitled Is there an African Democracy? He says:


  The gigantic problem shaping the fate of Africa is the gigantic
  discontinuity between the African village and the African city or town.
  The first problem we have in Africa is that the African educated elite,
  which is crucial in guiding the state, directly or indirectly copied the
  generality of Europeans in harbouring deep-seated contempt for African
  culture and African civilisation. Since the primary and most distinct
  character of African culture and civilisation is the African rural
  person, therefore, the contempt of the African educated elite for African
  culture is personified in the rural African.

Another concern that we have is that there appears to be a lack of zeal to
ensure that hostels are improved and upgraded. We urge the department to
show more enthusiasm in the upgrading of hostels. We hope that the
allocation of capital funds from the SA Housing Fund to the provinces will
lead to tangible progress in this regard.

In conclusion, I wish to say that it takes only seven days for a puppy to
open its eyes and be able to see after birth. Unfortunately, seven years
after we attained democracy in this country, there are some parties which
still cannot see any change in the lives of our people. [Interjections.] I
suggest that they see an optician. [Applause.]

Mrs M P COETZEE-KASPER: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, members of Parliament,
I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise the importance we attach
to the housing strategy objectives of building a partnership between
people, the private sector and Government. Therefore we can further
intensify our links and co-operation with the private sector for the
successful implementation of the various economic housing initiatives.

Our second primary target audience should consist of people whose earnings
are low and, to compound the problem, those who are retrenched or go on
pension. They are regarded as high-risk cases by financial institutions.
However, most of these people belonged to a savings scheme or have been
effecting some method of saving. We must tap into this market and galvanise
it into action for housing development and ownership. We are on course.
Steadily the dark clouds of despair are lifting, giving way to reason and a
season of hope and a better life for all.

At the dawn of our second phase after the first five years, the seventh
year, our practical actions have ensured that none can challenge the ANC-
led Government. We meant it when we said that we were a nation at work for
a better life for all. Society must guarantee the people's dignity on the
basis of good-quality housing and a quality life for all, regardless of
race, colour or disability.

Daar mag geen baasskap toegelaat word soos in die Wes-Kaap nie, waar die
DA, wat welaf en ryk is, die armes verdruk soos rotte in gate. [Applous.]
[No dominance may be allowed, like in the Western Cape, where the DA, which
is affluent and rich, oppresses the poor like rats in holes. [Applause.]]

We must seek to replace the people who, in many instances, continue to be
brutally disadvantaged at the expense of those who have. To replace the
informal settlements, the bond defaulters, the homeless and all others who
are affected by poverty with a community with a better life is a huge task.
This task can be carried out by Government agencies like Servcon.

The challenge facing Servcon is that they do not have the infrastructure or
the capacity to evaluate whether the communities are receiving value for
money. There are instances of people being charged double for houses. The
challenge to us as Government is to educate and develop communities to
question and be vigilant to malpractices. In this regard, the budget of
agencies like Servcon should be looked at to see what capacity we need. For
example, we need a surveyor in Servcon to assist our people.

I am happy to announce that Anglo Gold, whose work is focused on such
important issues as home ownership - I want to congratulate Avgold, who are
there in the gallery - is assisting the Government. At the beginning of our
second phase, let us work together towards nonracialism and one nation. May
the selfless example and initiatives carried out by Avgold and the
bondholders' association serve to inspire all of us to spare no effort in
the struggle to create a caring society with pride and dignity.

We should work in close partnership with all stakeholders, inspired by the
call: ``There shall be houses, security and comfort for all''. We should
ensure that we draw on the genius and energy of the nation to give
something that will surely be new, good and dignified.

Co-ordination of all social developments must be improved in accordance
with the line functions of the social cluster. A fine example of this is
the Mphatlalatsane project for the mentally disabled. This kind of project
is proof of our commitment to improve the quality of life of all South
Africans.

This kind of project is the beginning phase, and we will make
multidisciplinary interventions of this kind, starting with a few pilot
areas. We will draw in all spheres of Government and engage the people, as
we always have, to ensure that the levels of homelessness and informal
settlements are reduced. Measures must be taken to strengthen the capacity
of local authorities to enable them to mobilise the communities against
resorting to land invasions and illegal squatting. We must be vigilant and
employ strategies to guard against corruption, for example, people abusing
the housing data bank to get double subsidies.

It is in this context that we must commit ourselves to overcoming the
problem of urban density and not leave it solely to the local authorities
that often do not have the capacity to deal with it. The private sector's
involvement should be encouraged. This will show that each one of us wants
to change the cycle of poverty of the homeless and create a quality
lifestyle by pursuing a consistent programme of policies for the indigent
at local level.
It should not happen that any one of us feels alienated. Whatever the
circumstances of our people, none should be driven to the level of despair
which forces them to a peripheral existence at the fringe of the
mainstream. We, as the Department of Housing, consider the work of
restoring the pride, identity and ownership of our people as being vitally
important.

The task of advancing the integration of communities of all citizens
towards the success of a single nation calls on us to increase our efforts,
both as Government and private sector, so that we approach the task ahead
with all due seriousness and a sense of discipline. To recognise the fact
that all rights are accompanied by obligations and responsibilities will
require that all spheres of Government be defended by the freedom
guaranteed in our Constitution. The good that has been done puts into very
sharp relief everything that still has to be done to extricate another one
million of our people from conditions of abject homelessness, racism,
sexism and violation of human dignity from which too many still continue to
suffer.

Ek wil net graag vir die Minister 'n idee gee van wat Avgold tot dusver
gedoen het. Op 5 Mei 2000 is 31 subsidies van die provinsiale regering
ontvang om die huise aan die afgedankte mynwerkers te kan oordra. 0p 27
Oktober is 23 subsidies oorgedra. Op 20 November is 11 subsidies aan hulle
toegewys. Dit wys net daar is genoeg huise, ons hoef nie te sukkel nie.
Daar is genoeg geld as die rykes aan hierdie kant net hulle deel wil bydra!
[Tussenwerpsels.] Hulle moet uit hulle kokonne breek en gaan kyk wat daar
binne aan die gang is.

Ons sou nie slums gehad het soos ons nou hier in die Wes-Kaap het as hulle
lankal gesorg het dat die mense ordentlike huise kry nie. Dit maak nie saak
wat ons Regering vandag bou nie, die mense sê hulle het ten minste 'n dak
oor hulle kop, elektrisiteit, riool en al dié dinge, want daardie mense
voel hulle hoort iewers en die huise behoort aan hulle.

Ons sukkel nog steeds om 100 jaar gelede se huise van die ou regering aan
die gemeenskap oorgedra te kry! [Applous.] Ons sukkel nou nog om 30 jaar
gelede se huise van die ou regering oorgedra te kry. Dit is wat hulle maak.
Dit is hoekom hulle so baie mense uit huise sit wat hulle nie kan bekostig
nie. Hulle weet nie wat dit is om te onderhandel nie. Hulle ken net die
geweer en die polisievangwa's, maar ek sê vir hulle, die wiel gaan teen
hulle draai hier in die Wes-Kaap. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[I would just like to give the Minister an idea of what Avgold has achieved
thus far. On 5 May 2000, 31 subsidies were received from the provincial
government to transfer the houses to the dismissed mine workers. On 27
October, 23 subsidies were transferred. On 20 November, 11 subsidies were
allocated to them. This just shows that there are enough houses, we do not
have to struggle. There is enough money if the rich people on this side
would only contribute their share! [Interjections.] They should break out
of their shells and go and look at what is taking place there.

We would not have had slums like we have here in the Western Cape if they
had seen to it long ago that people got decent houses. It does not matter
what our Government builds today, the people say that at least they have a
roof over their heads, electricity, sewerage and all those things, because
those people feel they belong somewhere and the houses belong to them.

We are still struggling to have houses built 100 years ago by the previous
government transferred to the community! [Applause.] We are still
struggling to transfer houses built 30 years ago by the former government.
That is what they have done. That is why they evict so many people from
houses they cannot afford. They do not know how to negotiate. They only
know the gun and the police vans, but I am telling them, the wheel will
turn against them here in the Western Cape. [Applause.]]

Dr R T RHODA: Chairperson, hon Minister and colleagues, I have only a few
minutes and would like to make a few points. [Interjections.]

The poor Western Cape! In the constituencies that I represent, namely
Manenberg, Heideveld, Bokmakierie, Guguletu, Kewtown and other parts of
Athlone where up to 30 people sleep in a single council flat, and where
more than five large families are faced with the problem of squatting in
backyards, some sleeping in disused pigeon lofts and kennels, not to
mention the thousands who live in informal settlements, it is very
difficult for me to stand here and be satisfied with this budget,
especially the amount that was allocated to the Western Cape.
The 8% is a drop in the ocean, and I feel that the Minister should have
fought for much more money. I am sure that it must be a terrible
disappointment to all in this House, and more specifically to those poor
souls I have just mentioned, that several millions of this budget will have
to be spent on the establishment of a special investigating unit within the
Department of Housing to deal with the widespread corruption, fraud and
theft.

We can only hang our heads in shame at this disgraceful state of affairs in
our new democracy, where patriotism is being consumed by the fire of sheer
greed for money at the expense of the powerless poor masses. One only hopes
that it will not be necessary for such a special department policing unit
to be established in all other portfolios, especially when we think of
Defence and Water Affairs and Forestry, where there have also been
allegations of large-scale fraud and corruption. What a sorry state of
affairs!

We must find a better way of dissuading rural dwellers from trying to
squeeze themselves into overcrowded cities. Perhaps a more concerted effort
is needed to make the rural option a more natural, safe, attractive and
comfortable option - more electrification, fresh water, schools, clinics,
shopping and recreation centres, better roads and so on. The bright lights
of the big city will always be a strong attraction, but rural dwellers must
be made aware of the downside of trying to survive in overcrowded cities.

The director general has also bravely admitted that previous attempts to
deal with the defined problems of housing in isolation from crime, for
example, are counterproductive. Because all social and political problems
are inextricably interwoven, economics affects health, health affects
education, education affects housing, and so on. Active co-ordination ...
[Time expired.]

Miss M N BUTHELEZI: Chairperson, hon Minister of Housing and comrades,
allow me to talk about a group of people who, for so many centuries, have
been unfortunate. This is a group of people who suffered what the political
scientists would refer to as triple oppression: oppression from society,
from their husbands and from the apartheid government. I am talking about
women.

For so many years, they were deemed unfit to own houses, run their
businesses and be in charge of their own affairs. As I said, the above-
mentioned terrible hardships women had to go through were as a result of
deliberate policies by the apartheid government aimed at suppressing them.
Meanwhile, it is irrefutable that this ANC-led Government has dramatically
improved the status of women.

Allow me to focus my attention on the policies that the Department of
Housing has embarked upon in addressing the plight of women. In line with
the black economic empowerment policy, the Department of Housing has made
it its business to create space for women contractors in the housing
business world. About 10% of every approved subsidy scheme is given to
women contractors to make their mark. It is as a result of these policies
that we are seeing the vigorous emergence of women contractors all over the
country.

We congratulate these emerging women contractors, because they have shown
us that women can be as good, if not better, in the construction field. We
are talking about groups like Golden Nest, Simunye Women's Consortium,
Kgomotso Construction - the list is endless. From 1994 to 2000, the
Government was able to assist 516 000 female-headed households, which
constituted 36% of beneficiaries. In the year 2001 alone we saw 58 000
female-headed households, constituting 41%. This is remarkable delivery,
and we should give credit where it is due.

Not only do these figures help us to see the improvement, but they also
mark the vast difference between the old and new orders. The difference is
that the old order expertly recognised colour and gender, whereas the new
order is both colour-blind and gender-blind. This is physical evidence of
delivery that no antidelivery government like the DA can ever refute or
challenge.

Allow me to talk about the one million houses we promised our people in
1994. The pessimists on my left may have regarded this promise as a far-
fetched dream, but sincerity, dedication and tireless efforts have once
again proved the ANC to be a Government of its word. Up to March 2001, the
total number of houses delivered nationally stands at 1,12 million. Hon
members will recall that this figure was achieved against all odds. Happily
for the first time in their lives, our people have shelter. What we can
infer from the above is that this Government continues to have a caring
attitude about the poorest of the poor.

In its housing manifesto the ANC promised to speed up change and delivery.
The rate of housing delivery is approximately 200 000 units per year. May I
state that the rate at which we deliver these units has not been
challenged, even internationally. Allow me to illustrate this point.
Singapore built only 55 000 units in five years, Cuba built only 85 000
units in five years, Sweden built only 250 000 in five years and South
Africa built 750 000 in five years. [Applause.] In 10 years Sweden built
only 1 million houses and in seven years South Africa built 1,12 million.
To ask more than this, as these figures suggest, is rather unfair and
unrealistic for a struggling country like South Africa.

Of course, the Government alone would never have done this without the help
of dedicated women's organisations, like the People's Dialogue on land and
shelter and the Homeless People's Federation, which has built 15 000 houses
nationally, 3 500 of them in KwaZulu-Natal. Those who cannot appreciate
success will view this as slow delivery, but, considering that the houses
they build are big, we surely cannot blame them for this.

It is ironic and surprising to find that organisations like those mentioned
above, which deal with earners of extremely low incomes, such as R700, can
build a 62m2 house at a cost of, literally, R13 000. Yet one finds that
developers who are given the full subsidy produce only 21m2 houses, as is
the case in the Western Cape. This deserves serious examination, for this
Government cannot afford to be a financial ladder for unscrupulous
developers.

What is even more interesting is that these women's organisations have the
ability to help those in the rural areas. For example, in KwaZulu-Natal
they go as far as KwaMpumuza, eMpangeni and Mandeni. We have seen these
women's contributions at Inanda, Newlands West and Lindelani, transform
informal settlements into beautiful townships.

Njengoba le Ndlu yemukela isichibiyelo soMthetho wezezindlu owabe uqeda
amabhodi ezezindlu ezifundazwe, sikholwa ngukuthi oNgqongqoshe bezifunda
bazokwazi ukusheshisa uhlelo lokwakha izindlu ezindaweni zasemakhaya.
Siyafisa ukuthi amakhosi oselwa asebenzisane noMnyango wezeziNdlu ekutheni
abantu basemakhaya bakwazi ukuthola izindlu abazifunayo,njengokwezifiso
zabo. Kodwa-ke, lokho kuyokwenzeka ngokuthi nabo babambe iqhaza emizameni
eyenziwa nguMnyango wezeziNdlu. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[As this House adopts the Housing Amendment Bill, which abolished
provincial housing boards, we hope that the MECs will be able to speed up
the programme of building houses in the rural areas. We want amakhosi to co-
operate with the Department of Housing so that the rural people will be
able to get the houses that they want and hope for. This will happen if
they play a role in the efforts of the Department of Housing.]

Allow me also to talk about the upgrading of townships and hostels. The
apartheid government made sure that our poor people lived in filthy and
hardly ever bearable living conditions. It fills me with great joy to
finally realise that at last we have a Government that cares and sees this
for what it was, namely brutal treatment. It is as a result of humaneness
in the ANC-led Government that we have a budget that recognises the need to
have urban renewal settlements.

The projects are already operational countrywide. We have seen them in
Gauteng, especially in Ruth First, Alexandra, Orange Farm and Soshanguve in
Pretoria, and at KwaMashu in KwaZulu-Natal. As per the constitutional
mandate, the portfolio committee has visited the Free State, Gauteng, the
Northern Cape, and the Northern Province, and we were very pleased about
the performance of provincial governments.

It was also interesting to see the attention the policies, like the social
housing programme in Gauteng, receive. The programme has produced about 8
000 stands and 7 000 units. Over 160 000 people have received title deeds
and are now the rightful owners of these houses they previously rented from
the state. As a result of the hostel upgrading, over 80 000 people living
in public-sector hostels have been upgraded in Gauteng alone. Nationally,
the statistics indicate that there are 378 000 state-owned properties which
were disposed of in terms of discount benefits. The sooner these properties
are transferred the better the lives of our people will be.

In further demonstrating its caring attitude, this Government has launched
a project that caters for disabled people. In the Free State and the
Northern Cape the Department of Housing, together with the Departments of
Health and Social Development, have had projects aimed at benefiting both
young and old disabled people.

Lastly, as the ANC, let us sing our own praises about how far we have come,
how much we have done and how much more we are willing to do in spite of
all that we have experienced. [Applause.]

Mr D G MKONO: Mr Chairperson and hon members, the budget before us is
pivotal in the upliftment of the poor and previously disadvantaged. It
stands at the centre of the delivery of basic services. Without housing,
water, sanitation and electricity are not achievable. Simply put, housing
or the lack thereof directly impacts on Government's ability to protect the
most basic of rights articulated in the Constitution.

Appreciated within the above context, an overall budget of R3,7 billion
appears mythical indeed. In fact, the department itself, in its strategic
overview and key policy development summary, admits to the resource
constraints. The department sets itself two primary key objectives:
firstly, the progressive realisation of the right to housing, and secondly,
ensuring sustainable human settlements, specifically shelter and privacy.
These are admirable and noble key objectives.

However, the UDM would like to suggest a third objective to add to the list
in line with our policy. Property and ownership should be seen as central
to the upliftment of the poor since it can provide collateral, therefore
ensuring millions of South Africans an opportunity to finally gain access
to finance and the formal banking sector. Without this type of ownership,
economic empowerment through enterprise development will remain something
we talk about, but ultimately an unreachable goal.

We welcome the admission made by the department about resource constraints
and changing demographics which necessitate a focus on quality rather than
the former quantity-driven approach. This admission does cast a shadow over
the claim, often made, of having provided over five million people with
security of tenure and safe homes.

It has been repeated many times before by the UDM that a great many of the
homes that have been provided in the past seven years cannot be described
as adequate living spaces. The human settlement redevelopment programme as
a new strategic approach to urban renewal is long overdue and we welcome it
wholeheartedly.

Finally, Government has recognised the wisdom of UDM policy regarding
integrated policy solutions. This programme, which aims to combine the
efforts of the national, provincial and local governments, is definitely a
step in the right direction. It is especially important that the alignment
of budget and planning between all spheres of Government should be extended
to all the activities of the department, and not just selected pilot
projects.

The importance of housing to the daily lives and welfare of our citizens
can never be underestimated. To illustrate this, a quick scan of the media
over the past 24 hours reveals numerous housing-related stories across the
country. Outside Durban home owners are blockading a road, demanding to
speak to the local MEC regarding poor-quality housing. In Port Elizabeth
the residents of Extension 6 were yesterday given two weeks by a court to
evacuate their shacks or have them demolished. There alone, 900 people face
a cold winter without even the negligible shelter of a shack. Here in Cape
Town, on this very day, people have been evicted from their homes in
Tafelsig by the local council for being in arrears with their rent.

This is the daily reality and struggle for housing that affects our people.
We urge the Government and this department to do everything in their power
to bring safe and proper housing to all the citizens of South Africa. The
UDM supports the Vote. [Applause.]

Mr W M SKHOSANA: Chairperson, in South Africa, the current transition to
democracy challenges both the people and the new democratically elected
Government to address the legacies of racial discrimination, national
domination and economic exploitation. South Africa's recent history of
struggle and mobilisation of people places a responsibility on all sectors,
not only on Government, to find a way to address the needs of the most
excluded people. It is a call that President Thabo Mbeki made in this House
when addressing the nation.

The Government inherited a diversity of housing development laws which were
based on apartheid ideology. This resulted in the lack of a overall focused
housing development strategy and further resulted in fragmented, poorly
focused and inequitable housing underdevelopment, caused by the structures
and the system. Inequality has created an environment of poverty, violence,
crime and uncertainty in villages.

Extensive consultation, negotiation and deliberations with many role-
players in the housing sector, including the national department,
provincial departments and local departments, resulted in the Housing Act,
Act 107 of 1997, which abolished all apartheid housing legislation and
replaced it with one single Act, which reflects the priorities of the
current Government.

South Africa is poised on the brink of fundamental change. The present
emphasis on good governance, with political parties and organisations of
people reinforcing the need for transparency and accountability of public
officials, creates participation at all levels of society.

It was with this in mind that the National Home Builders Registration
Council was formed under the Housing Consumers Protection Measures Act of
1998. The Act creates a national registration council with the power to
regulate the home building industry efficiently, to promote housing
consumer rights and to give housing consumer information.

We then went further and came up with the Rental Housing Act, which allows
the Minister to introduce a rental subsidy, housing programme or other
steps to make rental housing property accessible and affordable to low-
income persons. It allows local authorities to establish a rental housing
information office to advise tenants and landlords of their housing rights
and duties.

The Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land
Act, which was passed by this Parliament in 1998, prohibits unlawful
evictions and provides a procedure for the eviction of people from land.
The law is enforced to ensure that all processes, either in rural or urban
areas, are taken care of.

The Extension of Security of Tenure Act of 1997 provides security of
tenure, protecting people from arbitrary eviction in rural areas and peri-
urban land. The Act says that the landlord must obtain a court order before
evicting occupants. Gone are the days of the Land Acts and Group Areas Act.

Home loan mortgage legislation, which also deals with the lending processes
of financial institutions which provide home loans, is also being debated
by this Government, and it is hoped that the financial institutions will
support the Bill. It is the culture of the ANC to have a programme. The
housing subsidy scheme that was introduced in 1995 gives the Minister the
programme. People, as individuals, can obtain project-linked subsidies,
consolidation subsidies and institutional subsidies. It is exactly the
programme we need to ensure that we address the problem of housing in the
country. Housing subsidies are available to people living in rural areas
where there is communal land tenure and to people with informal land rights
tenure, under this ANC Government.

Sikholwa ngukuthi uma singalokhu sixova udaka njengoba uNgqongqoshe eshilo,
singasho ukuthi njengoba sesivele siqalile,   sizofinyelela esigidini. [We
believe that if we could continue mixing the mortar, as the Minister has
just said, not to say start, as we have already started, we will reach the
one million mark.]

We have dealt with the first million, and it is very unfortunate that the
people on my left do not understand what the one million package comprises.
It is not only about housing, it is about land, it is about a starter
house, it is about sanitation, it is about electricity and it is about
water. All those things were not available before. [Applause.]

It is also important for the hon Durand to ensure that he participates in
all processes of housing. He was not there when we visited the provinces.
We went to the Eastern Cape, and they were not there. We went to the
Northern Cape, and the DP and the confused New NP were not there.
[Applause.] We went to the Northern Province, and the representative of the
confused alliance came for only one day, and we were there for five days.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

He himself could have heard, as we moved around, people who were affected
by the flood. He could have seen that houses are being built right in the
late chief minister Mphephu's kraal. There were 36 houses built there.
Women were rejoicing and saying that ever since they were in that place,
under the regime of Mphephu and the NP they had never seen a house being
built for a woman. They said that. [Applause.] It is unfortunate that they
were not there to hear it with their own ears. We are on course.

Sixova udaka sishove ingolovane, futhi sizogcina sifikile  ezigidini
ezimbili. Izinkinga lezi esizenzelwe ngabalingani bethu ngapha kwesokunxele
sizobhekana nazo. Ngala mazwi-ke ngithi ngiyabonga. We are mixing the
mortar and we are also pushing the wheelbarrow, eventually we will reach
the two million mark. We will face the problems that were created by our
colleagues on the left. Those are my words. Thank you.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, hon Ministers and members, the crippling effect
of unemployment and poverty on the socioeconomic rights of our people is
creating conditions in which Government's constitutional responsibilities
and delivery obligations are tested against its ability to govern.

A perfect example of the constitutional obligation upon Government is the
recent Grootboom court judgment, in terms of which Government was held
accountable to accede to the community's right to housing. This is a right
enshrined in our Constitution. In fact, the court ordered that the
Government's housing delivery programme be rewritten, and I quote, ``to
provide relief for people who have no access to land, no roof over their
heads, and who are living in intolerable conditions or crisis situations''.

In terms of our constitutional integrity, this decision helped to
strengthen the democratic process in this country. In terms of the rule of
law, Government is obligated to govern efficiently and effectively. A
primary focus of whether Government is meeting its delivery mandate to the
people is on housing. The department has a housing backlog of over 3
million units, yet the longer the delays in eliminating this backlog, the
greater the increase in the homeless population.

We accept that the housing backlog is not the creation of this Government.
[Interjections.] However, the challenge of housing the nation is now a
constitutional responsibility of national, provincial and local government.
The problem of roll-overs or, perhaps more accurately, the inability of the
department to efficiently spend its money, is of serious concern. Winter is
upon us and the impact of the weather on poorer communities adds to the
greater cost to the state. In fact, it is estimated that more than 7
million people in informal settlements live in unhealthy conditions.

Although Government is putting up rental housing schemes, the extent of the
demand for housing is just too large, exacerbating the condition of people
having to move continually. The impact of this resettlement of people
eventually leads to more informal settlements and greater urban sprawl. The
department must work on improving its procedural requirements and, if this
can be done as soon as possible, the goal of providing people with adequate
housing can be attained.

I commend the Minister of Housing and her department on the visible
progress in delivery, but it remains a challenge to the Department of
Housing to continue the good work, to give access to housing to persons who
are less fortunate than ourselves. With these few words, the ACDP accepts
and supports the Vote. [Applause.]

Mr G D SCHNEEMAN: Chairperson, Comrade Minister, comrades and hon members,
season by season the trees of delivery continue to bear much fruit. These
trees are exceptional as they know no season; they bear fruit throughout
the year. Equally exceptional is the amount of fruit which has been borne
on these trees that are but a mere seven years old.

Each day in every city, town and village across our land new trees are
planted. We, as the ANC, will continue to plant new trees until each and
every person in our land has eaten sufficiently. These are the trees that
bear the fruit of delivery. [Interjections.] He should listen. [Laughter.]

Having just had the privilege of attending the 25th special session of the
United Nations General Assembly on an overall review and appraisal of the
implementation of the Habitat Agenda, I have returned home feeling
challenged, confident and proud; challenged because the entire world is
facing hurdles that need to be crossed and negotiated. Currently, 25% of
humanity lives without adequate shelter. The majority of the world's people
live in cities, and a rapid increase in urbanisation is expected, with most
of it taking place in developing countries. This is caused mostly by past
failures in rural development.
In two thirds of the cities in the developing world, their waste water is
not treated. In countries with economies in transition, 75% of solid waste
is disposed of in open dumps. Three quarters of the more than 1,2 billion
global poor live in rural areas. Tens of millions of urban families lack
security of tenure. I wish to quote an extract from the speech of the
executive director of Habitat, Miss Tibaijuka:


  For shelter, along with food and clothing, are the most basic building
  blocks of any poverty alleviation strategy or policy. Something must have
  gone awfully wrong when we formulate strategies and adopt programme
  frameworks to fight poverty, without including shelter delivery as one
  key element. The poor everywhere have inadequate shelter. We cannot hope
  to improve the health of the poor without improving their housing, and
  turning slums and tenements into livable neighbourhoods. We cannot hope
  to educate children, to bring light into their lives, if there is no
  light in their homes.

Here in South Africa we, too, have challenges that we need to and that we
will find solutions to overcome. Hon members must please note: We will. The
challenges we face are the providing of adequate shelter for all our
people, the eradication of informal settlements, inner city renewal, safer
cities free from crime, and the increasing movement of people from rural
areas to cities, amongst other things. These are as a result of the
apartheid policies, the after-effects of which we are now facing and
dealing with. When one looks at the challenges we face in comparison to the
rest of the world, one then realises that although they seem big to us,
they are, in fact, small in comparison to some challenges facing other
countries.

A number of cities shared their experiences of how various levels of
government and the private sector came together to find solutions at a
local level. Critical to the success of projects which we undertake is the
level of public participation. President Mbeki raised the issue of unity in
action in his state of the nation address earlier this year.

We need to see communities come together at local level - residents, the
private sector, NGOs and religious organisations - working together with
the different spheres of Government, to focus on ensuring that together
they, rebuild their communities, and that together they create a better
life for all. I would call upon all citizens of our country to join us and
work with us as we find and implement solutions to the challenges that we
face. We have achieved much as this Government, but we still need to do
more, and we will continue to do more.

We are confident because we are making progress in finding and implementing
solutions to the challenges we face. To date, we have been able to provide
security of tenure to over 5 million people through the building of houses,
and we have also seen the transfer of over 300 000 houses to occupants.
This is progress.

The city of Stockholm undertook major reinvestment in the inner city, which
resulted in the movement of people back into the inner city. Here, in South
Africa, the city of Johannesburg has embarked on rejuvenating the inner
city. In a recent report in The Star newspaper, stories of people moving
back to Johannesburg to live and work were told. This is progress. In China
a major urban renewal programme took place through the Fu and Nan Rivers
Project. It involved relocating an informal settlement of 100 000 people
into newly constructed housing, the cleaning of rivers and the upgrading of
infrastructure.
In Alexandra, just a few day ago, President Mbeki launched the urban
renewal program in South Africa, which will see Alexandra and other areas
totally transformed. This is progress. In Brazil, rural development has
seen people going back home. Here, in South Africa, the integrated rural
sustainable development strategy will soon be launched. This is progress.
Many countries spoke about the need to promote savings schemes. Here, in
South Africa, savings schemes are being promoted, and the Ministry of
Housing is developing a national savings initiative, the major aim of which
will be to link savings, credit and the subsidy to allow potential
beneficiaries to contribute and actively participate in their housing
provision. This is progress.

The presentations made by South Africa were well received, and a number of
countries indicated that they wished to visit South Africa to see and learn
about our policies and products. [Applause.] In comparing our policies and
programmes to those of other countries, it was clear that South Africa has
made great strides in implementing the Habitat Agenda and, in many
instances, is way ahead of other countries. [Interjections.] This is
progress, I would like to say to Mr Ellis. [Applause.]
A number of countries made reference to the South African experience and
the remarkable achievements we have attained so far. This is progress.
[Interjections.] What we have achieved here in South Africa in just seven
short years has not been achieved anywhere else in the world in such a
short space of time. The presentation made by the Minister of Housing at
the opening plenary session did not come across as just another speech, it
came across as a living and real experience.

Recently, while in the Northern Province, we visited an area called
Makhado, just outside Thohoyandou. In order to get there, we had to travel
up the side of a mountain. When we reached the top of the mountain, there,
right at the top in the middle of nowhere, was a people's housing process
on the go. People were building their own homes. For me that is progress.
That is what is happening in our country. This indicates that we have made
great strides towards the creation of a better life for all.

Finally, I am proud to be a South African. I am proud to be alive during
these historic times, hopefully being able to play some small part in the
reconstruction, redevelopment and reshaping of our country. Unfortunately,
I am not like Mr Durand, who is not even in the House now, which clearly
shows that he does not care. [Interjections.]

Most important of all, I am proud to be a member of the ANC, a movement
that is delivering on its promises on the creation of a better life for
all. It is a movement that is committed to building our country and to
ensuring that a better world is created for our future generations. We are
on the right road and heading in the right direction. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, Minister, the MF supports this Vote. Against
a background of impoverishment of the black people by the former regime,
the Government has done well to house the homeless.

This is in accordance with the Government's policy to provide housing and
secure accommodation, to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of
people. It is a constitutional right of every citizen to have access to
adequate housing, and the state must take the necessary steps to realise
this goal.

The MF welcomes the 1,7 million subsidies that were approved by the SA
Housing Fund between April 1994 and December 2000. During the same period,
1,12 million housing units were built. Approximately 65 000 consolidated
subsidies were approved for houses on serviced sites that had been approved
by the previous administration.

The country must note that approximately R14,6 billion was spent on housing
delivery between 1994 and 2001. Also about 33 000 beneficiaries of the
former first-time homebuyers' scheme will be supported until such time as
this scheme has been completely phased out.

The MF supports the overall allocation for the Department of Housing for
the current financial year, which has been increased from R3,439  billion
to R3,718 billion this year. Of this allocation housing development
consumes the largest part. It has been the policy of the Government to
provide housing for the poorest of the poor.

Today the MF wishes to make an earnest appeal to the hon the  Minister to
take into consideration that the earning capacity of those who were most
disadvantaged has been improved by a very small margin. Those in the middle-
income group are not able to afford housing on their present income. This
category requires a kick-start from the Government, which the Government is
in fact giving.

The MF would like to make the following request: that the provision of
housing for the middle-income group be accelerated,  allowing the various
provincial and local authorities to deviate from the national policy to
cater for those who earn below the income limit and cannot afford housing
on the open market, where prices are inflated because of the hated past.
The MF also requests the Government and the provinces to ensure that the
funds spent are used for quality housing and appeals to the Minister to
monitor the contractors so that better quality and spacious houses are
built and that space is allowed for extension for the home owners. The MF
supports the Vote.

Mr A SINGH: Chairperson, Minister, the ANC and their junior partner the MF
have proudly mentioned that 1,1 million houses have been delivered since
1994. The Minister has failed to give us the number of houses that are
collapsing while she is addressing Parliament. She should go to Alexandra.

The Minister blames the banks. In yesterday's Business Day, she says:


  SA banks had played a major role in contributing to the failure of
  Gateway, a home finance scheme in 1998.

Whilst that might be the case, what has the Minister done to stop such a
collapse, because she has a facilitating role in her department to help
those institutions that do not understand how we can deliver homes here in
South Africa.

The general manager for transformation at the banking council said that the
Gateway model had made it very expensive for banks to participate in the
deal. She should not just criticise the banks, but needs rather to play a
very important facilitating role in helping those institutions that do not
have an understanding of how to deliver. We cannot just point fingers at
these institutions. We need to be proactive for the sake of housing
delivery. It should not just remain an election promise: housing for all;
jobs, jobs, jobs.

We need to create an environment for housing delivery and create more jobs.
The famous buzz word in the 1994 elections was ``empowerment''. Clothing
debts created a situation in which housing loans were thwarted. Are we
really empowering our people? The poorer communities do not understand the
value of the single most important asset, namely a home. The poor sell
these houses for the paltry sum of R500, not understanding that this is the
single most important asset that they might ever acquire. The poor purchase
items to beautify these homes on HP and cannot pay this back. They are
evicted from these homes and have to pay higher instalments and exorbitant
rent to greedy landlords.

The DA says that the poor need to be educated to retain their shelter and
their asset, and at the same time find better jobs. I was privileged to go
on a tour in Warrenton, one of the developments in the Northern Cape. In
Warrenton the developer was out of sight and the roofs were not fixed to
the walls. Why can we not hold these contractors accountable? The poor
occupants had to place bricks, stones and other heavy objects on the roofs
to keep them from flying off. It is a criminal offence to allow developers
to get away with these poor standards.
Can we imagine a family, after many long years of suffering, getting a home
and, after the first storm, the roof flies off, resulting in rain damaging
their valuable belongings? Where are the clerks of works and building
inspectors who are supposed to inspect these houses before handing them
over to the occupants so that they can be safe for our people? In one home
I could actually scratch the mortar with my bare fingernails. What are the
inspectors doing? Are these jobs for pals or are they given 4x4s so that
they can get further contracts so that the poor communities can once again
suffer at the hands of this ANC Government? [Interjections.]

Housing delivery is very important and housing needs to be delivered by
this Government because that is one of its election promises. Is the
delivery of houses enriching developers at the expense of the larger poor
community? Developers are profit-driven. We need to get rid of those
developers in the industry who are fly-by-night and profit-driven
contractors. Officials who contribute to underhand contracts, fraud and
corruption in tendering procedures should be dismissed.

I was in Pietersburg. A private initiative to deliver houses has had
difficulty getting off the ground because of bureaucracy. The developers
are unable to build a single home as a show house because the ANC local and
provincial government refused to allow them to build a starter house so
that they could sell off their stands. The developers have tried
communicating with the departments in those local government structures,
but the communications have failed. Buildings belonging to the communities
there are falling apart.

Another case in point is in Alexandra. A new township, built there less
than two years ago, has started to collapse. The Minister needs to
distribute some kind of standard to these contractors and they should
adhere to it. The hard hat the Minister wore when she delivered her speech
needs to be given to the people so that those houses do not fall on their
heads. Residents in Alexandra are up in arms and are hoping that the
Minister will go to Alexandra and see those cracks on the floors and on the
walls. [Time expired.][Applause.]

Mr J N NASH: Chairperson, one million homes achieved in just five years.
This is what I want to highlight today. I want to thank the Minister for
making this milestone possible. The ANC-led Government under the able
guidance of our Minister has housed a million families within five years.
[Applause.]

In August 1999, the Government had already built one million homes. This
means that nearly five million people received decent shelter and
accommodation. A milestone in our transformation has been achieved. Show me
any other government in the world that can show such an achievement. Our
detractors claim that these houses are small, but they are starter homes
which allow for incremental development when the families have the
necessary resources. However, these homes have given families a decent roof
over their heads, which apartheid was unwilling to provide for the vast
majority. [Applause.]

We all know that apartheid was geared towards providing houses for the
minority, and those parties which criticise our policy use their past
practice as the measuring gauge to subjectively judge the present housing
policy. But they did nothing for the voteless majority when they were in
power. The Group Areas Act was designed to ensure that the majority did not
have access to property rights in urban centres. Notwithstanding this
shameful history, the hon Durand has had the temerity to call these small
houses, while his party is incapable of rebuilding homes for the victims of
the tornado in the Western Cape. [Applause.]

There is a vast difference between the homes which the NP built and the
homes that this Government is building. People are still in debt for those
homes. What is shameful about this is that as recently as last month, the
poorest of the poor were being punished by the DA for the arrears in rent
and services. Requiring the poor to pay the arrears prior to benefiting
from free services is certainly shameful. This is the thanks the poor get
for voting for this DA. [Applause.]

The hon Durand asks what has happened to the promises. I want to inform him
that the ANC-led Government has given the poorest of the poor a free home.
Not only this, they have made them landowners. They are no longer landless
subjects, but rather landowners - in other words, property owners. They
have been transformed from landless wanderers in squatter camps into
permanent citizens with a decent address in the land of their birth. These
are the promises we have fulfilled, and one million homes on top of all of
this. One million families are landowners. This what Minister Sankie has
achieved. [Applause.]

To address poverty, the Government has introduced free water and free
electricity. If members ask about the promises we made, then these are the
promises we have fulfilled. Free water and electricity are going to be
introduced all over this country. In the Western Cape they will be
introduced only for those people who do not owe money. This is the way they
choose to operate. The Government has provided sanitation and clinics in
rural areas. For the poor, the Government has ensured that there will be no
evictions without alternative accommodation. Those are the promises we have
fulfilled.

Let me turn for a moment to the hon Tony Leon. He is so desperate to boost
his ego and image that he is running all over the show in a futile attempt
to achieve fame. The other day, he ran to the farms to try and win support
for his unholy alliance. What he went to speak about was cottage
industries, which is actually an ANC policy. In the process of attempting
to speak on this subject, he missed the essential points altogether. He did
not address the poor housing on the farms.
Mr M J ELLIS: Tell us what they were!

Mr J H NASH: You are asking me and I am telling you. Nor did he address the
dop system, which is the cause of abject poverty. He did not address the
poor wages and working conditions of farmworkers. He did not address the
evictions from the farms.

Our little man, struggling to reach a political climax, is incapable, so
long as he misses the point about transformation and what that means!
[Laughter.] When there were problems in Zimbabwe, he went running there. He
did not speak to the elected government. He went to speak to someone else.
When there was a gold crisis, he ran to Britain, and once again he could
not help South Africa. [Laughter.] He went through the back door to speak
to the French, and only God knows what happened there. [Laughter.] His trip
to the USA was another controversial debacle. Poor Tony Leon, trying his
best to be a great leader, but failing miserably! [Laughter.]

As for the other leader, Marthinus ... I nearly said Comrade Marthinus.
[Laughter.] He has been completely sidelined in this unholy alliance.
[Laughter.] What did he do? He ran to Graaff-Reinet to haunt our heroes,
notwithstanding the history of his party in his vote-catching exercise. The
little boys Tony Leon and Marthinus van Schalkwyk are struggling to be
leaders, but, in reality, they are a comedy of errors! [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

The ANC, on the other hand, has one firm philosophy which can be summed up
in the words of Archimedes:


  Give me one firm spot on which to stand, and I will move the earth.

To our ladies up there, what are the women of the People's Housing Process
saying? They are saying:


  We shall push the wheelbarrow
  We shall mix the mortar
  We shall build the houses
  We shall build a nation

And that in spite of the Democratic Alliance - in spite of all that.
[Applause.] I hope that Mr Durand now knows what we have done with our
promises. [Applause.]
The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Mr Chairperson, hon members, I have been listening
to the debate in the hope that I might pick up some advice and some
contribution from people I expect to be part and parcel of changing this
country, even if they are from the opposition. But I could not pick up
anything new from what they said, which is unfortunate for this country.

Hon members will note that Mr Durand tried to give the impression that he
had been part and parcel of the liberation struggle. He was not! Because,
if he was, he would not be sitting on that side of the House. Knowing the
history of members of this House, there is no way in which he can jump onto
the bandwagon and appear to be patriotic when he is actually not patriotic.
[Interjections.] Secondly, if he has any sense at all and remembers where
we come from, he will know that there is a complete difference between the
houses that were produced by the apartheid government and the houses that
we are producing now. We are producing a complete package of shelter
connected to water, sanitation and electricity and a better environment.
[Applause.] We are providing our population with security of tenure, which
is very important and critical for anybody in the world. And this
Government, through the Department of Housing, has ensured that at least
five million people enjoy secure tenure. This cannot be compared with what
apartheid gave us.

The hon member from that side of the House chooses to forget and have
amnesia, and wishes completely to ignore the fact that for 20 years in this
country, the majority of our people were pushed from one part of the
country to the other. Secondly, they were prohibited from moving into any
area through the Group Areas Act. And to make sure that they were caged in
townships, they were kept very far away from the towns. In order to make
sure that they were caged in the townships, the kind of urban planning that
was put into place made sure that if anything happened they would not be
able to leave the townships. For example, in Gauteng one has only four
entrances into the townships. That was part and parcel of the oppressive
and aggressive system of apartheid.

Anybody who now comes up here and pretends not to know where this crime
comes from needs to be reminded of the facts. If one denies people basic
opportunities and amenities, one is bound to have problems of violence and
crime. But this Government, led by the ANC, and supported by the IFP, is
going to ensure that when it comes to houses and issues of urban planning,
it is going to get rid of some of the problems that have taken us to where
we are now.

I would like to remind the hon member that when one looks at our housing
and wants to relate it to issues of poverty, one has to go back to our
policy and understand what we are trying to achieve. We are providing an
incremental approach for our beneficiaries because we have never claimed,
as Government, that we are going to deliver on our own. We have said that
we are going to meet our beneficiaries halfway. We are going to provide the
capital housing subsidy, and we expect them to add value to our subsidy
through their savings, to add sweat equity. At the end of the day they are
going to come up with a house of a size which will be the best for their
families.  Those members should please go back to our policy before they
make a noise.

Another issue about which we need to remind members of this House on my
left is that the damage that the apartheid social system introduced into
our country will take many many years to get rid of. One had an aggressive
social system and aggressive institutions like the army, and it was ensured
that the rest of the population in this country was dominated by an
aggressive system. When they talk about crime, they should please remember
what they did to this country.

Those who talk about the sizes of the houses should please remember that
this issue is nothing new for us in this House.  Already, as the Department
of Housing, we have put into place an instrument, the National Home
Builders Registration Council,  which is going to ensure that we take care
of the state's resources and that the product that we leave on the ground
is of good quality. That is why we have the registration council, and that
is why we have people sitting in that office to try and ensure that we take
care of the fly-by-night developers who do not want to give us value for
money.

Hon members from the opposition side, especially Mr Durand, have also
forgotten because they are not following up on issues. He is not even aware
of what Government is doing. Flood management and disaster management are
under the Department of Provincial and Local Government. [Interjections.]
The Department of Provincial and Local Government and the Departments of
Housing, Transport, Water Affairs and Forestry, Land Affairs and
Agriculture sit in a committee that addresses this issue. I want to say to
Mr Durand that issues of disaster had not been better managed until we came
into office. [Interjections.] We have set aside a fund to deal with the
floods, and also committees, including the command centre from the national
level to liaise with the provinces to make sure that people who are victims
of natural disasters are taken care of.

In the Department of Housing we have allocated 0,5% and 0,7% of the annual
budgets for emergencies in housing. This is in line with the Constitution
but is also a response to the Grootboom case. And we acted this fast
because we wanted to indicate to him and the general public that this is a
Government that cares about its people. Despite the meagre resources, and
the damage that they have done to our economy we, still with the meagre
resources, try to address the needs of our people.

Most villages in the Northern Province are located on dangerous ground
within the 50-year or 100-year flood line. We have had to relocate people
away from such flood plains. We had a similar case in KwaZulu-Natal. The
Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs made sure that we benefited from
her resources. We had to go and buy land that was away from the Mkhuze
area, in order to make sure that our people were not visited by occurrences
of flood lines.

In addition, 391 officials have been trained through our capacity-building
programme in the Northern Province. We have managed to train about 2 697
officials at local government level countrywide and some of them are
councillors. They are trained through tertiary institutions to deal with
issues of housing and delivery, but also to make sure that they are
informed around issues of disaster management.

With regard to comments made by Mr Singh of the DP, we have the
registration council, whose function it is to take care of those joining us
in the construction industry who do not adhere to the minimum standards and
norms and do not respond adequately to the red-book requirements with
regard to engineering guidelines. [Interjections.] When people give us
subquality we invite them back to their own projects and ask them to repair
the damage. If they do not respond they are then deregistered, because we
are not going to tolerate bad workmanship.

It should also be remembered that it is the first time, in this country,
that we have had an institution of this nature. We are also quite aware of
the fact that there will be those who would like to take advantage of us.
Secondly, it must also be remembered that we have set up a warranty fund to
finance the repair of structural damage, whether it is leaking roofs,
cracking walls or problems with foundations. We have made sure that we will
have a fund in order to repair these damages. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: He does not know that.

The MINISTER: Obviously, he is not following what is happening. If one
could just look across the country, one would notice that we have been able
to contain the problem of unscrupulous developers, because people are
afraid of being deregistered and thrown out of the construction industry.

It is not true that we are not doing anything about the issue of hostels.
We have, through our budget, what is called the Hostel Redevelopment
Programme. We have gone out to all the hostels across the country to
improve the conditions there, and also to transform some of those hostels
into proper family units. I think we have made great strides in that
direction. We are also continuing to try and make sure that the hostels
become secure places for women, children and other vulnerable groups in our
society. We make sure that people who live in the hostels can actually
communicate and be part of the communities close by.

However, I think I will not have done justice to the matter if I do not
respond to what the hon member said about today's article. Once more, they
are not following issues. [Interjections.] Hon members will remember that
there was what was called the Botshabelo Agreement that was signed in 1994,
between the Government, the banks, the construction industry and civil
society, where it was agreed that all the sectors that represent parts of
society should commit themselves to normalising the environment in society.
Because we inherited tensions between communities and the banks, between
communities and the local authorities, and within structures that were not
in agreement in terms of the political environment and the atmosphere at
the time, we had to put in place an institution that would mitigate and
make sure that we table the issues, and resolve most of the differences.

In that agreement, the banks committed themselves to providing 50 000 loans
per year in order to get rid of the redlining. That is what they committed
themselves to doing, which gives us a total of 150 000 loans that were
supposed to have been awarded in three years. But, at the end of the three
years, they had only managed 73 000 loans in the low income sector. This
has since been reduced to less than 2% of what we are delivering on the
ground, which means that they actually have not really delivered on their
commitment. In 1997, 14% of all subsidised houses were credit-linked, and
86% were houses delivered through the Government subsidy. In 1999, it had
gone down.

Government has approved 1,351 million subsidies, and 1,129 million houses
have been built or are under construction. On the Government side, we have
committed ourselves to establishing housing institutions that will liaise
with the banking industry, and the communities so that we are able to
fulfil our commitment. I have just given the House a report of what those
housing institutions have been doing. We invested in excess of R1,5 billion
and provided guarantees of R2,1 billion to the banks in order to address
this issue.

I think that what we need to look at, as people who are forward-looking,
are the conditions under which we are operating, and the problems that are
confronting us. I am saying, in the article, that what is confronting this
Government, our community, and the banks, is the issue of - now and then -
some of the partners hesitating to move full-force into making sure that we
achieve our objective. [Interjections.]

I have got a report here from the CEO of the National Housing Finance
Corporation who works directly with the banks. In the report, the CEO says:


  According to the agreement, when the Gateway Home Loans institution was
  put into place, it was planned that there would be an investment of about
  R500 million, because of the pilot project through Makhulong Home Loans,
  a project that was going to give us an opportunity to see how far we
  could go.

[Interjections.] I am reporting back to this Parliament that we did not get
that investment of R500 million. But at the end of the pilot project, which
was at the end of March this year, only R182,8 million had been invested.
[Interjections.]

The issue that I am raising here is that we must accelerate the pace and
make sure that when we commit ourselves to delivering on issues, we do just
that. I think that, whenever there are problems, with due respect, we need
to look at other options and ways of trying to make sure that we do resolve
these problems.

In the article I say that we are not throwing away Gateway. We have just
transferred it back to the National Housing Finance Corporation. We have to
go back to the drawing board to find ways and means of making sure that we
do address the issue of credit and finance to the low-income earner,
because we cannot run away from the fact that our mandate is to address the
needs of the poorest of the poor. If what I am saying does not make sense,
then members should give me an alternative. But I think it does make sense.

I do not think that we are going to achieve anything in this House, if
people who are elected, on both sides of the House, by an electorate which
honestly believes that if it elects and votes for a person, that person
will address its needs, defend issues they have absolutely no clue about. I
would like to tell Dr Singh that I think that that is being very dishonest
to the electorate. It is very dishonest. He does not have the background on
Gateway, because if he did, I think his approach would have been different.

In February this year, our President, President Mbeki, announced the
Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Strategy, which has been
continuously managed by the Presidency in order to assist the different
departments in Government to get on with the programme of delivery as a
united and co-ordinated cluster force. We have already started implementing
the programme, and Ministers have been deployed in different nodal points,
where hon members will be liaising with the local leadership at district
and local level in order to make sure that we do deliver on this Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Strategy.

At the same time, regarding the issue raised by members seated to my left
who say that our approach is not integrated, they need to be aware of the
fact that our approach is co-ordinated and integrated. We are going to make
sure that we get the maximum out of this co-ordinated approach.

Regarding the issue of corruption, we have invested an amount of R5,4
million in our 2001-02 budget, R5 million in our 2002-03 budget and R3,5 in
our 2003-04 budget in order to begin to address the issues of corruption
that hon members have been talking about. To us it is a very serious issue
and we are going to make sure that we utilise resources in a manner that
assists us to curb corruption and fraud from whoever and wherever it comes.
We must ensure that the resources that are allocated by Government actually
reach the poorest of the poor.

The Department of Housing and all other state departments have committed
themselves to dealing with and eradicating corruption in our midst. All we
need is a member from that part of the House trying to pretend that they
initiated the issue of dealing with corruption. We have been dealing with
it since the day we took office. So it is really not news.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Minister, whilst you are at
the podium, I just need to clear up one thing. When you said that members
must not be dishonest to the electorate, were you referring to a political
failing or were you implying that in respect of personal integrity, the
member was being dishonest?

The MINISTER: Chair, I was referring to the issue of transformation and the
transmission of facts and information to the public, who have the right to
be given the correct information so that they take correct decisions on
whatever they do. Secondly, I think it is very unfair of the hon member to
come up with an opinion and a view based on just one article. It is very
incorrect. Thirdly, I operate from a public office which is open to members
of the public, members of my party and the opposition, and anybody else who
needs information, either to enlighten themselves or to prepare their
speeches. They are welcome to come and get the information, so that, at
least, when they stand at this podium, they project the true facts and
correct views to the public about what we are doing in the country.
[Applause.] I was referring to that issue.

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, on a point of order: At the end of the day, the
hon the Minister is still saying that the hon member is dishonest, and that
is unparliamentary. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I have tried to ascertain the thin
divide between the political element and the one that goes to the question
of a person's own integrity. The understanding that I have - and you can
correct me - is that it was in respect of a political failing and
responsibility to the electorate. But I am willing to hear you further on
this point.

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, the hon the Minister referred to an article. She
asked the hon member not simply to refer to one article, but went on to say
that he was being dishonest to the electorate. I would appeal to you to
read the Hansard and study it carefully. Perhaps you could come back to
this.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Yes, I think we will take that
route. Thank you, Minister. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 32 - Transport:

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: I am trying to find my speech in this Metrorail
bag, which contains lots of literature about transport that hon members can
find in the foyer.

Chairperson, Deputy President, colleagues and hon members, I want to begin
by expressing appreciation to the President, the Deputy President and my
Cabinet colleagues for their leadership, comradeship and support; to the
portfolio committee for advice and helpful criticism; to the MECs, some of
whom are here today,  responsible for transport and traffic safety; to
Salga for its continuing support and co-operation; to the chairs, CEOs,
boards, management and staff of our agencies and parastatals,
representatives of which are here today - the Civil Aviation Authority, the
SA Maritime Safety Authority, the National Roads  Agency, the Cross-Border
Road Transport Agency, the Airports Company, the Air Traffic and Navigation
Services Company, the Road Accident Fund, the SA Rail Commuter Corporation,
Intersite and the Regulating Committee - for sterling services in their
respective areas of work; to our law enforcement agencies all over the
country, which have played a valuable role in reducing road fatalities; to
Spoornet, Metrorail, the road freight, bus and taxi industries, the trade
unions and the many private-sector role-players for their contribution and
co-operation; and, finally, to the director-general, my department and all
officials, national and provincial, for their dedicated work and support.

It is due to the efforts of all these role-players that I am able today to
put before the House a number of significant achievements in the transport
sector. I am glad to be able to do so, because it is important that we
register successes in the face of the many challenges confronting us. I am
conscious that much more needs to be done, but I also think it is important
that I outline some of our major achievements.

There have been spectacular improvements at Johannesburg International
Airport and Cape Town International Airport. Durban International Airport
is nearing completion, as are a number of smaller airports. The issue of
King Shaka Airport is also being addressed.

Cape Town International and Johannesburg International have received world
recognition. We have taken decisive initiatives to promote representivity.
The results are now clearly to be seen in the staffing of the department
and the agencies. Both Cape Town International Airport and Johannesburg
International Airport now have their first ever black managers. Black men
and women form the majority on a number of our agencies' boards of
directors. The Rail Commuter Corporation has its first ever black
chairperson and its first ever black CEO. They are also here with us today.
[Applause.]

A tender to the value of nearly R400 million has been awarded for upgrading
rolling stock and signalling equipment. A total of 176 Metrorail coaches
are to be upgraded to come on line from July 2001 to the end of 2002, and
there are currently 15 projects under way to upgrade signalling systems at
various places. Under the Department of Public Enterprises 200 locomotives
are to be upgraded, 35 of which will be delivered this year.

Johannesburg's Park Station has seen a major upgrade and is receiving
further attention. Across South Africa, as at this year, 72 other station
upgrades have been completed at a cost of R532 million. A further 14
upgrade projects are currently in progress at a cost of R142 million. In
addition, there are now 73 modal interchanges in operation nationwide.

The national road network has been transformed; witness the Maputo
Corridor, the Lubombo Road, the N3 and the Kei Cuttings. All have
significant participation by small black companies, using local labour with
the provision of proper training.

There has been real and tangible progress in the transformation of the
minibus taxi industry. There has been a significant reduction in road
collisions and fatalities. Law enforcement is much improved, but there is
still a long way to go. The Road Accident Fund has a new board and the
appointment of the CEO is currently being finalised.

There has been an improved focus on safety in the air and at sea. I can
indicate that our Civil Aviation Authority is the first authority in Africa
and the third in the world to achieve the ISO 9001 accreditation.
[Applause.] It is a great achievement.

Together with members of the portfolio committee and others, MECs and
officials, we visited a number of stations and experienced, first hand,
some of the problems our commuters experience on trains and minibus taxis.
This has helped us to plan and strategise with greater insight into the
complex problems involved in creating a safe, responsive and integrated
transport system in our country.

I am also heartened by a noticeable shift of attitude, both in Government
and in the general public, towards a fuller recognition of the critical
role played by transport in our economy and social life. I welcome this,
because for me it is clear that transport must be seen as a fundamental
issue involving quality of life. Our collective progress in making it safe
and responsive is a measure of where we are as a nation and as individuals.


We inherited massive poverty and grotesque spacial distortions from
apartheid. The result has been a catastrophe. The poorer one is, the
greater the distance one has to travel. The further one is from work and
social amenities, the more socially excluded one is. The more excluded one
is, the poorer and more powerless one becomes. That is why I say every
positive transformation in the transport system directly touches the
quality of life of our people.

In his state of the nation address the President identified a number of
transport-related objectives. We have begun to address them. The first is
the transformation of our ports. Ports are important because 90% of our
international trade is conducted through maritime transport. Over the past
year significant upgrading has been going on under the aegis of Portnet.
Richards Bay is flourishing, Durban is due for a massive upgrade, there is
Saldanha and, of course, the Coega development project is taking off.

To facilitate greater efficiency and productivity, Government resolved to
separate the landlord function of Portnet from operations. The landlord
function will reside in a special entity. The private sector will become
more involved in operations through the process of competitive tendering.
For our part, as Government we are also finalising a comprehensive
commercial ports policy so that all these methods are properly streamlined.

The President also spoke about a better balance between road and rail. He
said there should be a shift from road to rail in respect of both freight
and passenger transport. This will be an incremental process, beginning
with actions to level the playing field, making rail transport more
attractive while imposing and enforcing strict controls on road transport -
not unreasonable controls, but strict ones.

This means dealing punitively, where necessary, with freight and public
passenger vehicle overloading. It will require supporting actions to co-
ordinate overload control strategies and harmonise maximum axle weight and
gross vehicle mass limits within SADC. It does not mean that we are
downgrading the importance of road transport. We know it plays a vital
economic and social role in our country and that many aspects of the
services it offers can never be replaced by rail. But we want a rational
debate that puts the interests of the nation, the economy, the road
infrastructure and the passenger before any sectoral interest. The bottom
line must be reduced costs to consumers, improved speed, efficiency and
security.

With regard to roads, over the past few years significant investment has
gone into the Maputo Development Corridor, the N3 road project, the N4
Platinum Highway and the Lubombo Road. All the investment for these
concession projects, a massive R8,8 billion, has been sourced from the
private sector, working on the built, operate and transfer (BOT) principle
and the introduction of tolling. This has also contributed indirectly to
national development by freeing resources for allocation elsewhere.

We can therefore make a strong case for additional fiscal support for
nontolling infrastructure investment on the basis of resources already
saved. Indeed, Cabinet has already asked me to take the lead in producing a
road development plan for South Africa. I will shortly be calling role-
players together to start work on this with a view to presenting a new
roads blueprint to Cabinet as soon as possible.

What is less well known are the all-round gains to the economy and our
people that have flowed and are continuing to flow from these concession
projects. To spell these out, 1 300 km of road are being upgraded,
rehabilitated and maintained by these funds and 6 860 direct jobs have been
created with salaries amounting to R321 million.

Approximately 17 000 people have been trained in skills varying from basic
life and business skills to relatively complex construction skills. The
total value is R12,6 million. Some 530 SMMEs have been developed. Contracts
to a total value of R207,7 million have been awarded for design and
construction work. An amount of R13,4 million has been awarded for
operation and maintenance contracts.

At the top end of the empowerment scale three very large contracts have
been awarded. One, for seven sections of road construction valued at R31,6
million has gone to Vulakabusha joint venture, while another, for bulk
diesel and bitumen supply has gone to the empowerment group Tepco at a
value of R16,1 million. The largest of the three, however, is the R38,6
million contract for the building of the Maputo and the Moamba toll plazas,
the Nelspruit maintenance centre and the Trac offices in Nelspruit. The
contractor GMF is a joint venture between two SMMEs, one South African and
the other Mozambican.

On nonconcession projects, not only on national but also on provincial
roads where assistance has been requested by MECs, similar major employment
and training successes have been registered. A total of 6 400 jobs have
been created at a salary value of R86,2 million. SMME contracts have been
awarded to the value of R101,5 million in design and construction, and to
the value of R19,6 million in operations and maintenance. As many as 31
contracts to the value of R135,8 million have been awarded for
rehabilitation, improvement and new facilities, and 6 000 people have been
trained at a cost of R3,6 million.

As members can see, the SA National Roads Agency has been strikingly
successful in using concession contracts and joint ventures as a platform
for black economic empowerment. The consistent aims are to ensure that the
affirmable business enterprises are drawn in, that equity and contract
management roles are given to previously disadvantaged and historically
disadvantaged individuals, and that women, particularly the poorest rural
women, are involved in labour-based construction and maintenance work and
life skills training.

In this context I want to pay tribute to the KwaZulu-Natal department of
transport's ongoing household-based Zibambele project. This is a rural
poverty relief scheme that has allocated some R200 million for access road
maintenance to some of the most destitute households in the deep rural
areas of the province, mainly headed by women.

An HON MEMBER: Viva Sbu!

The MINISTER: Comrade Sbu is present in the House this afternoon.
[Applause.]

This brings me to the second major transport emphasis in the state of the
nation address, viz accelerated provision of road infrastructure and
integrated transport services in the context of Government's integrated
rural development and urban renewal programmes. On the rural dimension,
infrastructure issues are linked to issues of transport service provision.

My department has already taken significant steps to address key issues of
access and mobility experienced by our rural communities. It has completed
an in-depth analysis of the areas of Lusikisiki in the Oliver Tambo region
of the Eastern Cape, Nongoma in KwaZulu-Natal and Bushbuckridge in the
Northern Province. As a result of the analysis, a CD-ROM has been prepared
to guide planners in the provincial and local spheres of government. The CD
contains a rich body of case-study material together with practical guides
to carry out co-ordinated nodal and linkage development, and designing
transport modes and systems, specifically aimed at supporting rural
development interventions.

In the meantime, practical poverty alleviation programmes have been going
ahead. In the 1999-2000 financial year we allocated R100 million for the
Eastern Cape and the Northern Province, and 55 roads agency engineering
projects, which mainly focused on regravelling rural roads, building
drainage systems and carrying out minor bridge works, were completed.

An amount of R50 million was invested in the Northern Province, and that
has resulted in the upgrading of 233,3 km of gravel roads and the
completion of 104 drainage structures. Over a period of 24 months, 5 193
jobs were created, with 1 543 women participating in the various projects.
An amount of R50 million invested in the Eastern Cape was used to upgrade
634 km of gravel roads and to construct six new bridges. A total of 4 138
people were employed, including 1 802 women.

For the year 2001-02, a further R94 million has been allocated. The funds
have been divided between national and provincial governments and projects
will be carried out in the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, the Free State and
the Northern Province. The national projects will focus on roadside
facilities to accommodate pedestrians, nonmotorised vehicles and long-
distance travellers. Infrastructure such as off-ramps for taxis and bus
bays, pedestrian crossings, passenger shelters and safe trading facilities
are planned. Many of these are nonexistent in many of the rural areas.
These will boost economic activity and promote safety and comfort.
Provincial projects will continue to focus on upgrading rural access roads
and minor bridge construction.

I want to turn to our national bicycle programme. A national bicycle
transport initiative, known as Shova Lula [Ride Easy], has been initiated.
The programme is, in the first instance, targeted at primary and secondary
school students and will later focus on the thousands of urban and rural
workers who currently have to walk long distances to get to work.

There is an exemplary joint initiative between national, provincial and
local government, and an NGO, Afribike, supported by partners in the US,
the UK and the Netherlands. Together they have been able to procure low-
cost new and used bicycles and have developed delivery chains that include
a container-based shop, a cycle repair training course and light
engineering modifications to produce load-carrying work cycles. They are
also running a scholar programme and a women's training programme.

The extension of bicycle transport, in both rural and urban areas, is not
just a matter of facilitating access to bikes and creating jobs. The safety
aspect of cycle use is now a key element in urban renewal planning
processes, as we saw just the other day, when the President launched the
R1,3 billion renewal programme for Alexandra. The provision of safe and
convenient cycle tracks alongside every upgraded street or road is a major
component of the Alexandra infrastructure upgrade. The pattern has been set
and the next proposed step is to develop similar bicycle programmes in all
of the 13 identified rural development nodes.
There is also the question of rail. The Khayelitsha area of Cape Town will
benefit, in due course, from the first railway extension project in the
area for many years. My department has allocated an amount of R20 million
to extend the existing railway line by 4,1 km from the present terminus to
the new terminus to be built near Baden Powell Drive. We are hoping that
provincial and local governments will contribute equal amounts. I am sure
that they are willing to do so, and we hope that that the money will be
forthcoming as soon as their funds make it possible.

In all the intermodal developments that I have mentioned - I have indicated
that there are more than 70 of them - a direct interface has been created
between Metrorail, bus and taxi services, and space has been opened up for
a vibrant, well-regulated onsite training sector. I want to congratulate
Metrorail and Intersite on the important contribution they are making to an
urban commuting experience that is more efficient, more integrated, more
user-friendly, and safer. Much, of course, still needs to be done. I also
want to congratulate Spoornet on the launch of the new corporate image of
its mainline service, now called Shosholoza Meyl, and for the attention to
comfort, efficiency and service quality that underpins that new image.

I have spoken often about the transformation of the minibus taxi processes,
so let me simply say that the legalisation, democratisation and
formalisation processes that have been inching forward for so long are now
close to completion. The formal registration of all taxi associations,
operators, drivers and vehicles on provincial databases will be finalised
as soon as the Be Legal campaign terminates. Each of the nine provinces now
has a democratically elected taxi council in place. All the existing
umbrella bodies, such as Satacco and MTA, and all the elected councils have
been drawn together in a national conference preparatory committee, tasked
with charting the process towards a single unified taxi body for the whole
of our country.

I am aware of the violence that erupts now and again, and one expresses
condolences to all those who have lost families and loved ones as a result
thereof. We regard these taxi processes as one of our priority matters. We
hope that a national conference will be held before the end of the year to
adopt a constitution and hold elections for the first truly democratic and
representative leadership the industry has ever known.

In the meanwhile, the recapitalisation project that, over a period of time,
will cost over R4 billion is moving steadily ahead. The six short-listed
bidders are at work refining the raw prototype vehicles they displayed
earlier this year, and a separate tender is out for a vehicle electronic
management system, EMS. All short-listed bidders will be given an
opportunity later this year to submit their best and final offer,
incorporating the revised EMS technology specifications. In addition, all
vehicles will be subjected to an SABS homologation process and to severe
road testing by Gerotek as part of the evaluation process.

I turn to a big problem, and that is the impact of the historical
underfunding of transport infrastructure in general. The most critical
impact has been felt in the rail network. Here we have seen a steep decline
in the reliability of the ageing rolling stock fleet and the emergence of
serious safety issues, resulting from the poor condition and technical
obsolescence of current signalling systems. Resources allocated have been
insufficient, either to address these safety issues or to effectively
control widespread fare evasion and criminal activity at stations. The
irony of this situation is that apart from being the most environmentally
friendly mode of motorised public transport, rail is intrinsically much
safer than road transport.

Let me turn to roads. We see that we have been living off our assets for
the past 10 to 15 years and are now facing very significant costs to
maintain the deteriorated network and restore the roads to a reasonable
standard. Despite the sterling efforts of the SA National Roads Agency
Limited, Sanral, to which I have referred, South Africa's national,
provincial and local road network is deteriorating at an alarming rate,
with potentially very serious consequences for both economic development
and safety.

It is true that over the past year or two we have taken some significant
steps, but more steps will have to be taken to reverse the decline in the
quality of our road transport. And so we are seeking to do three things at
the same time: Firstly, to seek, creatively, to expand the resources
available to both rail and road infrastructure investment; secondly, to
attack overloading head-on; and thirdly, to ensure that the road freight
sector internalises at least some of the damage which it causes, so that we
create a more equitable environment for competition between road and rail.

I am currently putting together a high-level team of officials from my
department, working closely with Sanral, the provincial government and
specialists from the CSIR. Their brief is to urgently reformulate the
national overload control strategy, with a special focus on the overall
funding strategy, the  optimal use of existing traffic control centres, a
systematic operational strategy to implement interprovincial and cross-
border enforcement actions, the intensified deployment of new weigh-in-
motion technologies and an investigation into the possibility of securing
their evidential viability in court, and the expanded use of public-private
partnerships to manage and maintain strategic traffic control centres and
to install and operate weigh-in-motion sensor systems.

In terms of our air services, again a theme in the President's speech, we
are pushing ahead with the opening up of our air services between our
country, region and continent and the rest of the world. The aims are to
drive up service quality and reduce fares through effective choice, to make
air services available wherever required and to support tourism. We are
speeding up the process of implementing the Yamoussoukro Declaration on
Open Skies for Africa. We are reviewing and, where necessary, renegotiating
our existing range of bilateral air service agreements. Specifically with
regard to the Cape Town-London and Johannesburg-London routes, British
Airways, Virgin Atlantic and the UK government are satisfied with the
current arrangements for scheduled flights. There are also no limitations
whatsoever on charter flights.

Our capacity to handle increased traffic volumes is continuing to improve.
Air Traffic and Navigation Services (ATNS) has nearly completed a
significant infrastructure upgrade in our country to enhance air traffic
service delivery to air space users. This has resulted in significant fuel
savings of up to R20 million for the industry. The projects will be
completed over the next two years and will result in further efficiency
enhancement. With regard to transformation and capacity-building, I am
pleased to record that ATNS has made excellent progress in the training of
air traffic controllers from historically disadvantaged groups over the
past three years. Eighty per cent of new recruits are currently being drawn
from these groups.

Then there is the whole issue of safety. We have prepared legislation to
put into place a rail safety regulator. We are setting up a judicial
commission of inquiry to look at the accidents which have occurred and to
make recommendations. And we are taking steps to improve signalling
infrastructure and training, and to address hours of work so as to ensure
that we improve rail safety.

There is also the question of shipping, where we are focusing specifically
on fisher folk, upgrading our search and rescue operations, and enforcing
vessel safety standards. There is much that one can say about these
matters; time, of course, does not permit. In terms of our general civil
aviation safety, our record remains good. As I have indicated, the
accreditation which our authority has received has only been equalled by
two other countries in the world, and by no other country in Africa.

The most important problem to which we need to give a great deal of
priority attention is the question of road safety. It is here that we have
achieved a degree of success over the past couple of years. We do not want
that to go to our heads. We think that more needs to be done. So, over the
next period, we will see more action being taken to improve the situation.
I have no doubt that the improvement that we have seen will continue. More
than that, we are taking some more fundamental actions and we hope very
shortly to launch South Africa's comprehensive new road safety strategy,
which we have called the Road to Safety.

We have gone some way towards addressing some of the transport problems of
our country, but there is much more that needs to be done. With the co-
operation of all the role-players who have come here today and those who
are not here. I am confident that over the next few years we will be
turning the situation around and making transport an industry that is
respected in our country, not only by the industry itself but by those who
most need it, the poor people of our country. [Applause.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Chairperson, the DA can never support this Vote.

An HON MEMBER: Why?

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Because, Chairperson, the wheels of the Transport Minister
are coming off badly. The Minister's reply to the questions last Wednesday
was, to say the least, disappointing. One only needs to analyse his reply
to questions in Parliament.

``The Department of Transport has set about transforming South Africa's
road network.'' That is what the Minister says. ``Today it is equal to the
best in the world.'' Who on Earth would believe this? The truth is that the
Automobile Association calculates that poor roads in South Africa shot up
from 5% in 1990 to 33% today. Does he call this the best in the world?

The SA Bitumen Association warns that urgent spending of at least R7
billion on the maintenance of South Africa's national and provincial roads
should be undertaken to prevent the further deterioration of the
infrastructure to the point of no return. Does he call this the best in the
world? The problem is so huge that Government may now be held legally
responsible for the damage caused in up to 140 000 roads accidents
annually. Is this the best in the world?

The backlog in the maintenance of South Africa's railroad system has been
allowed to rise to R25 billion. The Government is spending only R350
million per annum on railroad maintenance. The hon Mr Nash should just go
and have a look at the budget. That amount is only half of what it costs to
buy a luxurious jet aeroplane for the President, and hopelessly too little
to maintain the road system. Metrorail reports that at this tempo of
funding, in 50 years' time there will be no rail system left. Is that the
best in the world?

The taxi industry has been allowed to build up a maintenance backlog of R20
billion and the recapitalisation programme does not get off the ground.
Thousands of taxi commuters die annually because of dilapidated taxis and
the ANC Government's inability to get the taxi rehabitalisation programme
going. Can this evidence ever support the nonsense the Minister wants us to
believe?

Experts in the field of transport economy all agree that the development of
a transport infrastructure is closely linked to growth in the GDP and that
a well-developed and well-maintained transport system serves as the
essential lubricant for a well-run and positive developing economy. Social
goals like poverty relief and the creation of wealth cannot be achieved
without an acceptable transport system. Why, then, does the Government so
sadly neglect, without any exception, all modes of South Africa's transport
system?

The main problem is that the Minister of Transport and his Government
perceive transport as an engineering nuisance. He cannot recognise it as
the essential socioeconomic tool to achieve the liberation of the economy,
with resulting economic growth, job creation and the narrowing of the
income gap. The Minister's reply to the questions put to him last Wednesday
confirms that point.

The Green and White Papers on transport are actually both not policy
documents. The laudable goals failed because the policy was meant to
support the aims of the RDP, which never took off. The Director-General of
the Department of Transport was actually irritated when he informed the
portfolio committee on transport, while explaining the budget proposals,
that there is no policy on the subsidisation of public transport. His
department is therefore in no position to apply transport as an economic
enabler. What a revelation!
The second major problem is that Government does not have the ability to
deploy the existing financial resources more effectively so as to meet the
country's social demands, whilst sufficient savings can be achieved at the
same time to fund the much-needed maintenance of South Africa's transport
infrastructure.

Wat is die oplossing vir die probleme wat geïdentifiseer is? Dit lyk vir my
ons soek dringend na 'n ander Minister van Vervoer, wat die rol van vervoer
in die volkshuishouding verstaan en ook nog lus het om sy moue op te rol en
iets te laat gebeur.

[What is the solution to the problems that have been identified? It would
seem to me that we are urgently looking for another Minister of Transport,
who understands the role of transport in the national economy and also
feels like rolling up his sleeves to make something happen.]

Nothing is happening. The Minister is promising us, but he is not
delivering.

Suid-Afrika kort 'n onmiddellike, omvattende, geïntegreerde vervoerbeleid
waarin die staat se verantwoordelikheid en prioriteite duidelik uitgespel
word vir die daarstelling van 'n goeie vervoerstelsel wat, soos 'n goeie
gesondheid- en onderwysstelsel, aan die sosioekonomiese behoeftes van die
land sal voldoen.

Private inisiatief moet binne 'n duidelike vervoerplan met ingeboude
regulatoriese verantwoordelikheid vir die staat aangespoor word om 'n
optimale vervoerstelsel tot stand te laat kom en in stand te hou. 'n
Duidelike subsidiebeleid vir openbare vervoer moet ontwikkel word, waarin
die staat die verantwoordelikheid neem vir die bedryf, sowel as die
instandhouding, van onlonende maar noodsaaklike openbare vervoerdienste.

Die regering skram hiervan weg. Dit is nie nodig vir die huidige geslag
Suid-Afrikaners om die verantwoordelikheid vir die totale finansieringslas
te dra nie. Langtermynfinansiering, soos die uitreiking van staatseffekte,
sal ingestel moet word om in die onderhoudsbehoeftes te help voldoen,
terwyl direkte verbruiksheffings, soos tolgelde en brandstofheffings, die
uitgawe aan onlonende dienste moet help subsideer.
Die DA dring daarop aan dat die ANC-regering dadelik sy verskuilde agendas,
soos die selfverryking van die bevoorregte klein elite in sy binnekring,
moet laat vaar om die belange van Suid-Afrika se pendelaars 'n slag voorop
te stel. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[South Africa lacks an immediate, extensive, integrated transport policy in
which the state's responsibility and priorities are clearly spelt out as
regards the establishment of a good transport system which, like a good
health and education system, will meet the socioeconomic needs of the
country.

Private initiative should be encouraged within a clear transport plan, with
built-in regulatory responsibility for the state, in order to establish and
maintain an optimal transport system. A clear subsidy policy for public
transport should be developed in which the state takes responsibility for
the management, as well as the maintenance, of unremunerative but essential
public transport services.

The Government is shying away from this. It is unnecessary for the current
generation of South Africans to have to shoulder the responsibility for the
total financial burden. Long-term financing, such as the issuing of
government stock, will have to be implemented in order to help meet the
maintenance needs, while direct user levies, such as toll fees and fuel
levies, must help to subsidise the expenditure on unremunerative services.

The DA insists that the ANC must immediately abandon its hidden agendas,
such as the self-enrichment of the privileged small elite in its inner
circles, in order to place the interests of South Africa's commuters first
for a change.]

Mr J P CRONIN: Chairperson, Deputy President, Minister, over 90% of this
budget that we have in front of us, as with previous budgets in recent
years, is allocated for transfer payments. The Department of Transport will
not directly spend the majority of its own budget itself. Most of the
Department of Transport's work is done at arm's length, through agencies,
parastatals and other spheres of government both local and provincial.

This might create the impression, for those of dull perception, that there
is no coherent or active transport policy, exactly the impression that Dr
Odendaal has tried to foster now. I am pleased, therefore, that the
Minister devoted a great deal of his speech to giving us just some brief
overview of the many things that are happening on the transport front.

He mentioned, for instance, the upgrading of something like 72 railway
stations by Intersite, working with Metrorail and the SA Rail Commuter
Corporation. Many of those railway stations are in townships. There is also
the renovation of three international airports carried out by ACSA; the
transformation of the national road network, with the Maputo Corridor, the
Lubombo Highway and the Kei Cuttings; innovative community-based road
maintenance in KwaZulu-Natal, in the form of the Zimbambele project; the
Shova Lula bike project; and taxi legalisation, formalisation and
democratisation - a very complicated task achieved extremely well by the
Department of Transport. There is also massive investment in port
restructuring and the commencement of a whole new port in the shape of the
Coega development. Tese are only a few of the projects.

There are both mega, hi-tech projects and innovative, grass-roots, South
African developmental projects under way. We might also add that transport,
including therefore private-sector transport, is one of the few sectors of
the economy that has shown consistent growth and job creation over the last
period. Contrary to what Dr Odendaal is saying, there is a buzz of activity
going on in transport. How does it all fit into a bigger picture?

In his state of the nation address at the opening of Parliament this year,
President Thabo Mbeki spoke of a shift of emphasis away from the macro
economy to the micro or real economy. He spoke at some length of the need
to lower input costs throughout the economy, without attacking workers'
wages. Surely effective, efficient, reliable and well-resourced transport
is critical for this vision? Linked to these themes, President Mbeki also
dealt at some length with concrete programmes and key nodal points for
urban renewal and integrated rural development. Again, transport and
transport infrastructure are critical for this renewal and for this
development.

Transport is a basic need. It is like water, it is like shelter, and it is
connected to those other needs. The word ``integrated'' is especially
important in, for example, integrated rural development. In the past few
years major developmental efforts - housing projects, the construction of
schools and clinics - have sometimes been limited in their social impact
because of insufficient integration between them. Once again, transport and
transport infrastructure are often the key, if sometimes absent,
integrating factors.

Backing up the President's shift from a macro to a micro emphasis in the
real economy is the MTEF announced by the Minister of Finance, Comrade
Trevor Manuel, which allocates R7 billion over the next three years to
infrastructure. We regret to say that not all of that infrastructure is
transport infrastructure, but we hope that a substantial amount of that R7
billion will go into infrastructure for transport. In general, this
emphasis on infrastructural spending is to be greatly welcomed. It is very
much in line with the RDP vision of linking growth and development.

One of the potential limitations affecting the Department of Transport in
its attempt to drive a coherent transport policy lies in some of the
institutional realities that we have inherited in this new government. The
key transport parastatal, fundamentally Transnet, with its cluster of
transport-related corporations, falls under Public Enterprises. I do not
want to launch a turf battle, and indeed there is a good and healthy
working relationship between the Department of Transport and the Department
of Public Enterprises.

The clustering of Ministries that has been happening over the last period
has also helped to achieve strategic coherence. However, there is a danger
in this institutional arrangement in which Transnet falls under the
Department of Public Enterprises. The danger is that a range of very
different parastatals, some with little strategic value to growth and
development and others absolutely integral to those objectives, will all be
submitted to a generic one-size-fits-all restructuring.

When we as a committee met, often jointly with the Portfolio Committee on
Public Enterprises, with Transnet and its family of corporations such as
Portnet, Spoornet and Metrorail, most members, including members seated to
my left, were extremely impressed with the quality and seriousness of
senior managers, many of whom are sitting here today. However, we have also
been struck by several sometimes incompatible, perhaps, strategic
objectives that these managers believe that Government expects them to
pursue.

On the one hand there is an expectation that ring-fenced corporations will
return profits, perhaps or perhaps not in order to prepare them for
privatisation. These are at least two objectives. A third objective is that
they should at least provide an efficient economic infrastructure, whether
this is profitable or not. Then they are expected to provide social
services and address the issue of black economic empowerment and, sixthly,
that of job creation.

In the best of all worlds these may well be six congruent and converging
objectives, but, in reality, they might not be. The one objective might
sometimes frustrate the realisation of another. What applies in one
parastatal, say Metrorail, may not apply at all in another, say Portnet. We
need to guard against the idea that there is a generic one-size-fits-all
exercise called ``restructuring'' and all that it requires is some manager
supremo, hired gun or turnaround guru - without referring to any particular
individual.

I was very pleased to note that the Minister has reported on some of the
efforts that he has carried out by way of investigating in detail transport
needs and challenges in places such as Bushbuckridge, Lusikisiki in the
Eastern Cape and Nongoma in KwaZulu-Natal. As a result of this work, the
Minister has also produced a CD-ROM to help empower and facilitate
provincial and local level decision-making and planning. It seems to me
that this is an important direction that the department in general must
pursue in the coming years.

Much of the legislation that we have passed here in Parliament, not least
the National Land Transport Transition Act, critically depends on capacity
at provincial and local government level. For instance, we are calling for
metro governments and municipalities at town level to have clear transport
plans and to connect these plans to their local development plans. This is
not going to effectively happen unless there is empowerment and
capacitation. I hope that significant sections of this budget that the
Minister will be spending on the department will go towards facilitating
this capacitation. While the Minister is about it, he can also give Dr
Odendaal a couple of CD-ROMs as well to help him to understand what is
happening, as it seems he is a bit confused about these matters.

Many of the agencies that fall within the Department of Transport's budget
appear to be functioning extremely well. The Minister has mentioned the
South African National Roads Agency, the Air Traffic and Navigation
Services Company, the SA Maritime Safety Authority, the Cross-Border Road
Transport Agency, and notwithstanding some difficulties, the Civil Aviation
Authority. The Minister has also mentioned the ISO 2001 achievement, which
is one in three in the world.

The Road Accident Fund presents us with very complicated challenges. It
receives a levy imposed on petrol and diesel. The fund's total assets in
2000 were R2,2 billion, but its current liabilities have risen to R2,6
billion and its long-term liabilities are somewhere in the region of R10
billion. A long-term strategy is clearly required, and we look forward to
the outcome of the commission headed by Judge Satchwell, which we expect in
the coming months. We also look forward to interacting with the RAF and all
interested parties.

We also notice that in this budget the Minister proposes to set up two
further regulatory authorities, which are the rail safety regulator and a
port regulating authority. We look forward to playing our legislative role
in helping to set them up. When it comes to the rail safety regulator, it
should be noted that rail safety in South Africa is not just about
operational safety such as signals, maintenance of infrastructure and
operating protocols. Rail safety is unfortunately also about a range of
social problems: suicides on rail tracks, vandalism and theft, effective
crowd control and communications, muggings and murders. Sadly, yesterday
there were another two deaths on the Cape rail network.

We do not know whether these social issues fall under the idea of a rail
safety regulator as well or whether they need to be addressed in other
ways, but they certainly have to be addressed. They need to get priority
attention. If we are to achieve the switch from road to rail that we
envisage, we have to address safety.

The Minister spoke about the need to grasp the infrastructure investment
nettle in his speech. We could not agree more. Both road and particularly
rail infrastructure and rolling stock are suffering seriously as a result
of 20 years of neglect. We need to find creative ways to address this.

Finally, on behalf of the portfolio committee, I would like to thank the
Minister, the director-general and staff members, especially those doing
parliamentary liaison work, for their availability and frankness and for
their encouragement and assistance to us in our attempts to develop our
oversight role. This is very much appreciated. The ANC supports Vote 32.
[Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Chairperson, hon Deputy President and hon Minister, it is
a pleasure to take part in this Transport Vote debate. I can really say
without fear of contradiction that it is a privilege to be a member of the
transport portfolio committee with a Minister such as Mr Omar, who I think
enjoys the respect that he deserves from all parties, in spite of what Dr
Odendaal has said. [Applause.]

Our portfolio committee performs extremely well with the quality of members
that we have under the able leadership of the hon Jeremy Cronin. The IFP
will be supporting this Vote, but let me immediately say that it is not
without many serious reservations. When one considers the expectations that
are placed on the department from both Government and the public, it is
unrealistic to expect the department to perform to those expectations on
the limited budget it receives.

Let me use the following example. Of the total budget of R4,649 billion,
just R100 million is allocated for infrastructure spread over two years.
How can we be expected, for instance, to maintain our rolling stock, which
was already 25 years old in 1994, on funds of this nature? However, I have
no intention of discussing any budget figures as such. I am sure other
speakers in the debate who have nothing else to say will cover this for us.

Op die gebied van vervoer is daar geweldig baie kwessies wat 'n mens kan
bespreek, en wat dan ook elke jaar deur verskeie sprekers gedek word. Ek
wil graag vandag 'n paar aspekte bespreek wat nie normaalweg altyd die
hoofberigte haal nie.

Min mense sal besef watter ontsaglike skade misdaad en meer spesifiek
diefstal in vervoer aanrig. Metrorail ly jaarliks etlike miljoene rande se
skade weens venstervandalisme en die diefstal van koperkabels. Metrorail se
treine kort tans meer as 2 800 vensters wat meer as R1 miljoen sal kos om
te vervang. Mense hang aan die bagasierakke, swaai heen en weer, en skop
die vensters uit. Hulle lê dan langs die spoorlyne waar medepligtiges dit
later kom optel om te verkoop.

Meer as R1 miljoen se koperkabels is ook gesteel. 'n Maand gelede is daar
op die Naledi-spoorlyn 84 sinjaalkoppe oor 'n tydperk van drie dae gesteel.
Dit het daartoe gelei dat duisende treinpendelaars dae lank gestrand was
aangesien dit vanselfsprekend onveilig was om die treine in dié
omstandighede te laat loop.

Alhoewel dit seker nie 'n gewilde saak sal wees om aan te roer nie sal die
departement baie ernstig daarna moet kyk om weer 'n volbloedpolisiemag vir
vervoer op die been te bring. Die ou spoorwegpolisie, soos hulle bekend
gestaan het, was baie meer effektief om spoorwegeiendom te beskerm en te
beveilig as wat sekuriteitsmaatskappye tans is. Feit is, 'n voornemende
misdadiger is baie meer skrikkerig vir 'n polisiebeampte as vir 'n
veiligheidswag. Hierdie is 'n kwessie wat doodeenvoudig nie langer
geïgnoreer sal kan word nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[In the area of transport there are an inordinate number of issues that one
could discuss, which are in fact covered by various speakers every year.
Today I would like to discuss a few aspects that do not normally make the
headlines.

Few people realise what tremendous damage crime and, more specifically,
theft do to transport. Metrorail annually incurs several millions of rands
in damage owing to window vandalism and the theft of copper cables.
Metrorail's trains are at present short of 2 800 windows, which would cost
over R1 million to replace. People hang onto luggage racks, swing backwards
and forwards, and kick the windows out. The windows then lie beside the
railway tracks, where accomplices later collect them so as to sell them.

Over R1 million rands' worth of copper cables have also been stolen. A
month ago on the Naledi railway line 84 signal heads were stolen over a
period of three days. This left thousands of train commuters stranded as it
was obviously unsafe to allow trains to run in those circumstances.

Although it would not be a popular matter to deal with, the department will
have to take a serious look at once again introducing a full-blooded police
force for transport. The old railway police, as they were known, were much
more effective at protecting and safeguarding railway property than
security companies are at present. The fact of the matter is, a prospective
criminal is far more wary of a police officer than a security guard. This
is an issue that simply cannot be ignored any longer.]

An issue that also needs urgent attention is the very long distances our
children in rural areas often need to walk to school. It is a fact that
many rural children live up to six or more kilometres away from their
schools. They have to get up as early as 04:00 to get to school on time. It
is not possible to study successfully under these circumstances. It would
appear that the Government is considering supplying these children with
bicycles, which, at face value, seems like a wonderful idea. We are,
however, concerned that it could, in some cases and in many parts of our
country, lead to more problems than it would be solving. I hope these
bicycles will be equipped with canopies to protect against the sun and
rain.

The safety of children on the roads on bicycles, especially primary school
children, is of particular concern. The terrain of some of our provinces is
also of such a nature that the child will ride the bicycle downhill all the
way in the morning, only to have to push it all the way uphill in the
afternoon. I suspect the only answer to this issue is that rural schools
should all be supplied with school buses to transport the children to and
from school. Are these children not also entitled to ``a better life for
all'', which, after all, is a Government slogan? I seriously do not believe
that there is another answer to this.

An issue which is very much a matter of public debate at the moment is that
of the arrogant Coleman Andrews, an American who was supposed to be a
twinkling star, but whose appointment ended in disaster. As we now know,
Andrews, as chief executive officer of SA Airways, was paid almost R232
million for his efforts - an unbelievable R10 million a month - which
cannot be justified and must be properly investigated. Is it not shocking
to see that Andrews was worth more to South Africa than our own hon
President? It would further appear that the sudden major turnaround from a
loss to a profit for SAA under Mr Andrews had a lot to do with the selling
off of assets, and is therefore not a real profit. I must sincerely thank
the Minister for Public Enterprises - although he is not here - for the
open and transparent manner in which he informed the House on these issues
last week. That is the way things should be done.

At a presentation by British Airways to the portfolio committee in
Johannesburg, shortly after the appointment of Andrews, I raised the
question of whether South Africa really did not have suitable people to
appoint. The gentleman who was doing the presentation said that South
Africa had many suitable people. What caused me embarrassment was that I
was immediately told in a rude way by the former MP, Gregory Rockman, that
the matter could not be discussed because it was a majority party
appointment. To save the gentleman from British Airways further
embarrassment, I left it at that. Fortunately, Mr Rockman is no longer
here, and we hope and trust that this sad saga will never repeat itself.
Right now, the detractors of South Africa and the new Government are
laughing at us, and no one more than Andrews himself.

I want the House to take what I have to say now in the spirit that it is
meant: National transport in South Africa has too many masters. There are
too many bulls in the ring, as I have said before. It may be that a single
line of authority needs to be established to achieve a sharp focus on all
relevant matters concerning transport. National public transport as such
needs to be placed under the authority of only one Minister. All transport
problems of whatever nature need to be addressed with undivided attention,
and that is why a single line of authority is so necessary.

Wat wetstoepassing op ons paaie betref, het die situasie aansienlik
verbeter, alhoewel dit nog ver van standaard af is. Ons sit nog steeds met
die probleem dat ons verkeersbeamptes seker bykans 90% van hulle energie
spandeer om baie klein oortredings te polisieer. Daarmee probeer ek
geensins sê dat klein oortredings nie ook vasgevat moet word nie, maar dit
is ooglopend hoe daar weggeskram word van die harde teikens. Hulle slaan
die sagte teikens ontsettend hard, maar is doodeenvoudig blykbaar nie
bereid om die harde teikens ook genoegsaam aan te vat nie. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[As far as law enforcement on our roads is concerned, the situation has
improved considerably, although it is still far from being on standard. We
still have the problem of traffic officers devoting about 90% of their
energy to policing very minor offences. When I say that I am not suggesting
for one moment that minor offences should not also be clamped down on, but
it is evident that the hard targets are being avoided. They hit the soft
targets incredibly hard, but are apparently simply not prepared to tackle
the hard targets adequately.]

I would have loved also to touch on the taxi recapitalisation programme and
several other issues, like the 3 500 irregular drivers' licences identified
in the town of Tzaneen alone, but I am running out of time. Let me express
my sincere appreciation to all the departmental officials, from the
director-general down to the most junior staff member. In conclusion, I
want the House to realise that the Department of Transport is not a Mickey
Mouse department. If transport comes to a standstill, our country could
come to a standstill overnight. [Applause.]

Mr N E MAGUBANE: Mr Chairperson, hon Deputy President, hon Ministers, hon
members, last year the Department of Transport reported that 50% of the
country's rural roads were classified as being in a poor condition. The
absence of sustainable funding mechanisms, with particular reference to
rural roads, remains a matter of serious concern.

The Department of Transport formed a joint technical committee, known as
Transport 4x4, with the Department of Finance to develop an appropriate
funding approach to transport infrastructure. The delaying of
infrastructure maintenance as a means of dealing with shortfalls elsewhere
can only be sustained for short periods of time before infrastructure
conditions deteriorate to a point at which more experienced rehabilitation
becomes essential.

The deterioration of rural roads seems to be a common occurrence in most of
South Africa's provinces. In KwaZulu-Natal, a number of roads have been
closed. The road from Winterton to Ladysmith, for instance, has been closed
to all traffic except residents, as no funds are available to repair it. A
report that was tabled at the Cape Metropolitan Council Transportation and
Traffic Committee in Cape Town described eight major roads in the
metropolitan area as unsafe.

A minimum of R30 million is needed to build new roads in the rural areas
outside of commercial farming areas. Studies have indicated that 80% of
rural village roads and 91% of the roads in scattered settlement areas in
the former homelands are inadequate. In the scattered settlement areas,
there are no roads of high or intermediate quality, and only 9% are of
basic quality. It has been established that 100 000 km of access roads are
required to connect rural people to the transport network of the country.

The roads in South Africa's rural areas are so bad that more than half of
them have to be reconstructed. The absence of sustainable funding
mechanisms for transport infrastructure remains a matter of serious
concern. Money meant to be used for the building and repair of roads is
being diverted for the Government's running costs.

Approximately R100 million was made available, through the presidential
poverty alleviation programme, to the Department of Transport. Key rural
roads will be maintained and upgraded, where a range of integrated
development initiatives are in the process of being delivered. According to
the Moving South Africa Project, almost 80% of the rural population resides
in villages and densely populated settlements.
It has been established that rural communities need better roads than they
have at present. Roads need to be provided in a sustainable fashion to
those communities that need them most. In many such communities, the
economics of a road upgrade will not support the so-called 15% internal
rate of return that is usually recommended as a return-on-investment
hurdle.

Funding for social and noneconomic infrastructure needs to be done in a
transparent manner. Roads that can be self-sustaining and that can create
sufficiently high levels of internal economic returns should be identified.
At the same time, roads that are primarily developmental in character, and
are therefore unable to create sufficient economic returns to be self-
sustainable, should also be identified.

Data on South Africa's rural areas is rather scant. It has therefore become
critically important to fill the gaps in data on rural roads. Although
studies on the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal have provided some data on
community access roads, this needs to be supplemented in order to be able
to do some proactive work in the field of rural road provision and
maintenance in all of South Africa's provinces.
South Africa, like most other developed and developing countries, faces the
challenges of both improving and maintaining its existing transport
infrastructure. This challenge goes hand in hand with industrial and
commercial development. It is also clear that the planning of transport
infrastructure is an ongoing and a long-term process.

An important feature of the provision and maintenance of rural roads is the
division of the maintenance of roads at the level of local, provincial and
national government. This emphasises the need to focus on service delivery
in rural areas where the need is the greatest. This presupposes proper
planning, proper departmental monitoring and supervision of projects and
proper consultation between Government, departments and beneficiaries.

South Africa's policy on rural, provincial and national transport is, to a
large extent, based on the 1996 White Paper on National Transport Policy,
which is to provide safe, reliable, effective, efficient and integrated
transport operations and infrastructure which will best meet the needs of
freight and passenger customers. It is also aimed at improving the level of
service and cost in a fashion that supports Government strategies for
economic and social development while being environmentally and
economically sustainable.

[The other things that are found in small rural towns are transport forums.
These forums are there to monitor the situation in the rural areas and to
improve the quality of roads. In KwaZulu-Natal the forum has built many
roads that connect many places. In the olden times the rural people saw
this development as something that was far from them. They did not think
that one day roads would be built in the rural areas. The so-called small
developing contractors build these roads. These contractors did not exist
before. They started to emerge recently, since the ANC came into power.
These contractors are creating job opportunities for the rural community.
They employ both men and women and they are paid equal salaries. We see
women pushing wheelbarrows and carrying spades. They are opening waterpipes
so that when it rains ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Mr S B FARROW: Mr Chairperson, let me, at the outset, say that the budget
briefing by the Director-General of the Department of Transport to the
portfolio committee did not enthuse me as a layperson into believing that
the Minister was on track or that his budget addressed the real issues that
are facing transport in South Africa. [Interjections.]

Despite the restructuring of the budget into three programmes, it still
does not truly reflect an outcomes-based format. One just has to listen to
the public at large out there to realise the problem facing the Department
of Transport and decide for oneself if the budget, in any way, attempts to
face these issues head-on. These are: the declining road and rail
infrastructure, the high accident rate, ongoing taxi feuds, violence and
general disorganisation around the structuring and recapitalisation
programme.

Firstly, let me talk about the infrastructure. South Africa has been
blessed with good, sound road and rail infrastructure. But, due to
consistent overloading by road haulers and a lack of maintenance, our road
infrastructure has slowly but surely been eroded to the point that it is
now estimated that R65 billion is required to catch up with the backlog. In
last year's budget, I referred to this very problem and, despite the
assurance of the Minister that the National Roads Agency and the provinces
would work together in a move to declare some provincial road sections
national roads to be preserved and improved as part of the national toll
schemes, this has not materialised to any extent.

The fact that much of the money allocated to provinces for the fuel levy
never gets to be spent on road maintenance is another factor which needs to
be formalised. The Minister indicated that future allocations would be ring-
fenced on a proportional basis in order to ensure that funds are used
clearly for meeting road maintenance backlogs in the provinces. This, too,
does not seem to have really materialised.

Meanwhile the impact of deteriorating road surfaces is having a major
effect on our economy, which is borne out by the 5% to 15% road environment
accidents reported by Arrive Alive annually, and the 5% to 33% increase in
poor roads since 1990, which has recently been reported on. Rail
infrastructure has also been affected by the lack of funds. Here, too, the
rolling stock, signals and track maintenance accumulated a backlog
estimated to be in the region of R22 billion.

Metrorail is battling to keep its rolling stock and systems going and to
ensure the safety of its passengers. Shosholoza Meyl, the main line
passenger service of Spoornet, is looking at about R450 million over the
next five years to refurbish rolling stock and to set the entity on a sound
financial footing. This service has had a decline in passenger usage from
45 million passengers in 1982 to 4,2 million today. One needs to ask the
question: Why?
A concerted effort is needed by Government to build on these two services
in order to make them a viable, affordable, sustainable and safe public
operator. Here I must just mention the Bellville murders that took place
yesterday and various other aspects of safety which have not been
addressed. Serious consideration should also be given to the merging of
Shosholoza Meyl and Metrorail under one concessionary agreement responsible
for the operations whilst the SARCC becomes responsible for the maintenance
of infrastructure and rolling stock directly funded by the state.

Rail in South Africa has become the most ineffectively used mode of
transport, and this can be primarily attributed to the deteriorating
service delivery, uncompetitive rates, long delivery times and high
incidence of pilferage. The fact that Spoornet has to maintain
infrastructure whilst truckers do not gives road freighters a competitive
advantage. This needs urgent redress if we are going to be serious about
levelling the playing fields between road and rail.

These deficiencies are creating logistical nightmares for importers and
bulk users alike, and I am asking the Minister to seriously look at ways
and means of efficiently shifting cargo from the roads to rail and in so
doing make rail once again an attractive alternative. The quick-fix
solution of turning rail around needs to take into consideration the fact
that rail is far more efficient and cheaper to maintain than a highway.

The question that must be asked is: Why, then, does the department not look
at prioritising its funding strategy towards improving rail in such a way
that South Africa can compete in global markets? Most of this only requires
internal restructuring, re-engineering and restrategising. Much as Jeremy
does not think it really is the answer, I think good management could
actually assist in bringing these two aspects together.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, he is the hon Mr
Cronin.

Mr S B FARROW: Yes, Chairperson, the hon Mr Cronin. Arrive Alive has been
doing a reasonable job in bringing our accident rate down, providing the
department with statistics relating to the type of accident, and to a
certain extent educating and making the public aware of the causes of
accidents. This information should be more readily used in areas of high
accident incidents on a focused year-round campaign. I am pleased to hear
that that is taking place.

However, traffic police could be more readily used and more visible to
bring to book those consistent offenders causing the majority of accidents,
and not only during peak holiday periods. Funds must be allocated towards a
more co-ordinated approach to road safety using traffic and police
personnel nationally, provincially and locally.

Shortfalls in personnel, vehicles and equipment should be identified and a
sincere effort made to supplement the shortfalls where they exist through
budgetary support. By not doing this, the Minister is holding himself
accountable for over 9 000 road deaths and 140 000 accidents on our roads
annually. He and his provincial counterparts must show the public that they
mean business. We cannot continue to accept the disregard, by aggressive
drivers, of the rules of the road and vehicles that are unroadworthy or
overloaded and, on top of that, expect drivers to cope with badly
maintained and poorly signposted roadways.

Finally, let me focus on another matter which needs urgent attention, and
which I see very little support for in the budget set before us today. This
entails the whole question of promoting and encouraging the efficient use
of public transport. Rail and bus services leave a lot to be desired, but
the fact remains that 60% of the general public rely on minibus taxis for
their commuter needs.

Some 126 000 taxi operators, be they legal or otherwise, continue to serve
urban, rural and long distance routes in our country, yet no subsidies for
their services are considered in the budget. The fact remains that, despite
concerted efforts provincially and nationally, to date no formal and fully
representative taxi body exists to take forward the proposals entrenched in
the National Land Transport Transition Act.

The recapitalisation scheme that we have heard so much about has still not
reached any conclusive way forward. In the meantime, taxi operators wait in
anticipation whilst their vehicles get older and older and are reluctant to
do any major repairs, whilst Government dilly-dallies with clear-cut
decisions on their way forward at great cost to the many lives being lost
through taxi-related accidents.
The Minister needs to go back to the drawing board, listen to the signals
coming from out there and refocus his attention on the more serious
problems facing transport, and he should restructure his budget to meet
these priorities. Failure to do so will erode the most important
contributor to our economy - our sound infrastructure and the very lives of
our people. [Applause.]

Ms S K MNUMZANA: Madam Speaker ...

(Translation of Sesotho paragraph follows.)

[... before I start, I would like to say, as an act of respect to all the
people in the Transport committee, that when we come here to get briefings
about these issues, we must listen. We must not only listen to the things
that we want to listen to, and end up talking about things that we do not
really know about.]

The role of the Government in the recapitalisation scheme is purely to
facilitate the change-over to a more efficient, effective and safe
transport mode. The industry is arising from a situation in which the
apartheid regime failed to make adequate provision for the needs of the
overwhelming majority, who happen to be black. Many people see minibus
taxis as a curse but for more than 60% of the population, they are the only
mode of transport.

The growth of the minibus taxi industry is one of the heroic stories of the
struggle of the black South Africans against the economic oppression
imposed by the apartheid government. It is the only industry with the
greatest potential to empower the majority of our black people.

(Translation of Sesotho paragraphs follows.)

[One commuter describes his commuting life like this: He says he used to
wake up at four in the morning, to go to work, and he had to go to the
nearest station to get transport. The transport he would get was the usual
one used by everybody. There was no other way.

When he got to the station, he would get a train, and when he got off the
train, he would walk a long distance to work. When he finally got to work,
this poor person would be very tired. We must remember that it used to take
him 17 hours, altogether, to get to and from work. He worked for nine hours
and the other eight hours he would spend on the road, going up and down in
this public transport, to get to work and back home.

On the arrival of the taxi industry, his time on the road was cut down by
four or five hours. Therefore, his life became easier.]

Similar changes occurred in the lives of people all over South Africa, but
the taxi industry, in my view, will revolutionise the transport system in
the country. The benefits gained from the advent of the minibus taxi are
never properly communicated. The family lives of black people improved.
People had more energy to put into their work; they could increase their
earnings and look for jobs further from their homes, and their social lives
improved. The list goes on and on. But what I want to highlight is that
when people talk about the taxis, they should not only talk about the
negative things, such as bad drivers, unsafe vehicles, and taxi wars.

The apartheid government left the industry unregulated for many years,
whereas the bus industry flourished because of the subsidies given to it
and due to the fact that it was white-owned. [Applause.] The taxi
recapitalisation process is designed to change that legacy. The Be Legal
campaign which is currently under way is designed to formalise the industry
and give every operator an opportunity to register. The days of illegal
operators and radius-based permits are over.

In their place come legalisation and route-based permits. Those who stand
in the way of change will be swept aside as the tide swings against them.
Forward with the Be Legal campaign, forward!

HON MEMBERS: Forward!

Ms S K MNUMZANA: It is a fact that taxi owners did not have access to
capital or credit facilities. The question is: Why? The terrain was skewed
to make them small and not allow them to grow big. That reality is fast
changing, as this recapitalisation process ushers in a new era. I have no
doubt about the Government's commitment to supporting the industry, as this
recapitalisation process will deepen what started many years ago as a black
man's business.

There is no doubt that the taxi industry does not have a good image. Every
few days taxi accidents that result in deaths and injuries to large numbers
of passengers are reported. With the recapitalisation process, new, safe
and purpose-built vehicles will be introduced. The transformation of the
industry is aimed at the integration of the taxi industry into the public
transport system, so that the industry is not left on the periphery. What
we need is to strengthen the industry so that it becomes sustainable and
passenger-friendly.

As part of the transformation of the taxi industry, the National Taxi Task
Team, as its key objective, identified the consolidation, advancement and
sustainability of the industry. Consolidation includes the taxi unity
process. I am encouraged that Government is facilitating the unity process
to finally form a united Sataco.

In terms of the advancement of the industry, a national transport register
will be developed, and the industry will be regulated through the National
Land Transport Transition Act. Research shows an estimated 126 000 legal
taxis operated in South Africa by August 2000. The Department of Transport
estimated that there were more illegal taxis than legal ones during the
same period.

It is the objective of the Government that the existing fleet be replaced
by microbuses. The process will take place over a period of five years. The
policy of recapitalisation means, in effect, that by 2004 no minibus taxis
with 12 or 14 seats will be seen on South African roads.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: But do they want to?

Ms S K MNUMZANA: The R3,2 billion vehicle contracts will be spread over a
period of five years, and will involve the manufacturing of 85 000 minibus
taxis. We are now workshopping these members.

The process of shortlisting has been completed, though it is unfortunate
that one of the potential manufacturers to effect the replacement of the
correct minibus taxi fleet, which was ranked high, is currently under
liquidation. The Government will, hopefully, deal with that aspect, as the
final adjudication nears conclusion.

The recapitalisation has been plagued with numerous problems. Empa, Mosotho
wa kgale o re ha ho tse fumanwang di tonositse. [However, an old wise
Mosotho said, nothing is for free.]

According to the latest statistics on taxi operation in the Republic of
South Africa, more than 480 associations are operating throughout the
country. Sataco, which was launched in Pretoria in 1998, is the umbrella
body for all provincial taxi organisations. In addition to that, it acts as
a mediator in the event of disputes between taxi organisations, and it
plays an active role in eliminating the cause of taxi violence. Both Sataco
and Government signed a memo.

A conference for the national taxi associations will be held this year to
draw up a constitution and choose national leaders. The conference is
intended to give the industry a new structure to represent it during the
further negotiations on the recapitalisation programme. The Government,
Sataco and other stakeholders have endorsed the conference, except for the
national taxi alliance. The Government and the ANC support the budget.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]
Mr A R AINSLIE: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, Minister and hon members,
when one considers the fact that the ANC has been in power for a mere seven
years and that, during this time, it has had to contend with over 300 years
of backlogs, corruption and neglect of the kind which saw millions of rands
being spent on building roads in white areas and little or nothing in rural
areas and townships, of the kind which saw P W Botha divert transport money
to fight his war in Namibia, then what the transport department and,
indeed, the Government as a whole has achieved in this time is nothing
short of remarkable.

Dr Odendaal and Mr Farrow do not have bad memories; they are in a state of
denial. There is no need for them to go back to the drawing board, but
possibly there is a need for them to go back to school and learn a little
bit of history. For the first time in our history, in fact, we have a
comprehensive transport policy that encompasses all the people, not just
some of the people.

My constituency of Inanda near Durban had to wait until the ANC came to
power in 1994 to get even the most basic transport infrastructure and
facilities. Inanda's first robots, its first zebra crossings, traffic
islands, rumble strips, even its first bus shelters and school road safety
programmes, were provided only after 1994 as a result of ANC policies. Of
course, these things had long been common in privileged areas next to us,
in Durban North and Umhlanga Rocks, as Dr Odendaal and Mr Farrow could
probably tell us.

But much remains to be done and the Department of Transport in particular
faces many challenges. One of these challenges is the high vehicle
collision and fatality rate on our roads. We have about 500 000 smashes
each year in which some 10 000 people are killed and approximately 150 000
injured. But the ANC-led Government is meeting this challenge.

The Department of Transport said it would deliver on road safety and, as we
have heard again today, it is delivering on road safety. The Arrive Alive
target of reducing road fatalities by 5% has been exceeded, I believe, by
over 2%. When the final figures are out we can look for a reduction in
fatalities of something in the order of 7,4% since the inception of the
project. I believe congratulations are in order to the Minister, the MECs
and the respective transport departments.
The transformation of Arrive Alive into a year-round campaign will bring
new challenges, not least of which will be the campaign's budget. The
amendment we passed last week to the Road Accident Fund Act will ensure
continued funding from this source. The fund has for several years made an
annual contribution of about R50 million. This may have been sufficient for
a focus on peak holiday periods, but it is insufficient for a year-round
campaign. Additional funds and active support will have to be found from
the business sector, religious institutions and NGOs if the department is
to continue with the success achieved so far.

However, Madam Speaker, one cannot discuss road safety without mentioning
KwaZulu-Natal. Much of the approach to road safety that forms part of
Arrive Alive and now forms part of the Road to Safety strategy was
pioneered by KZN. The province has been acknowledged as a world leader in
road safety among developing countries and has been recognised as such by
the World Bank. Its Asiphephe road safety programme is a good example of
what can be achieved when the will of political leaders, committed
departmental officials and dedicated funding are merged to work together to
bring sanity to our roads.

The approach in KwaZulu-Natal is one of zero tolerance: zero tolerance for
any and every offence, from illegal parking to drunk driving and speeding.
The booze buses strike terror into the hearts of even the most hardened
drunk drivers. One may speed through the Western Cape on the way to Durban
and get away with it, one may speed through the Free State and speed
through Gauteng and get away with it, but as one gets closer to KwaZulu-
Natal one must be certain of one thing: As one approaches KwaZulu-Natal,
somewhere between Harrismith and Pinetown, they are going to get you.

Possibly the most serious challenge in relation to road safety is the
vigorous implementation of the enforcement leg of the programme. This
includes the deployment of sufficient numbers of traffic officers. But more
traffic police alone will not solve the problem. Effective enforcement also
requires the implementation of the set of laws Parliament has passed since
1999:

Firstly, we look for, in particular, the implementation of the
Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Act. This Act provides
for a more efficient system of collecting traffic fines. It also provides
for a points demerit system. A driver's licence will be suspended after 12
penalty points. For every point over 12, the driver's licence will be
suspended for three months.

Drivers will only be allowed two suspensions. When a licence is suspended
for a third time it will be cancelled and the driver will have to undergo a
driver's test again. In very serious cases a court may forbid a driver ever
to drive again. The proper application of this Act should help prevent the
type of accident which occurred at Muldersdrift two weeks ago, in which 12
people were killed.

It is reported that police found several traffic tickets in the vehicle
after this accident. These tickets show that the driver had previously been
booked for driving without a public permit, jumping a red robot, illegal
overtaking and driving an unlicensed vehicle. Each of these violations
under the Act could earn a driver four demerit points. I say ``could''
because these demerit points have not yet been finalised, and his or her
licence would be suspended after the third violation.

The Act is designed to detect abhorrent driver behaviour early, before it
becomes habitual and eventually leads to the horrific crashes members have
seen on our roads recently. There may be budgetary constraints in
implementing the Act, but if we are to break the continued cycle of
violence on our roads, then the funds need to be found.

Secondly, the Road Traffic Management Corporation Act is specifically
intended to strengthen co-ordination between the national, provincial and
local spheres of government. The objectives of the RTMC include uniform law
enforcement and uniform vehicle and driver testing and licensing. The
arrest last week of the Khayelitsha traffic chiefs for allegedly issuing
false drivers' licences is a sign that the authorities are taking the
allegations of driver licensing scams seriously. We commend their efforts.

Another objective of the RTMC is the professional career development of our
traffic officers. The road safety strategy relies heavily on our traffic
officers. We need to ensure that their training and remuneration are on a
level that encourages professionalism and dedication to their duties.
Safety on our roads is not advanced when traffic officers come off a long
and demanding shift in the field and then have to moonlight to make ends
meet.
I believe that the department is preparing for the launch of the RTMC, and
we welcome this. As anxious as we are for the Act to be implemented as a
priority, it makes sense that the new municipal authorities need first to
be prepared for their traffic management functions. [Applause.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Madam Speaker, allow me first to congratulate the Minister
on having delivered quite a comprehensive speech. May I say that it is a
pleasure to work with the officials and also with the portfolio committee.

Unfortunately and very sadly, I have to inform Comrade Mnumzana that just
before she spoke I was told about a bad accident that took place just
outside Worcester on the N2. Something like 18 people were badly hurt.

A disturbing trend is manifesting itself. It seems that everybody who has
anything to do with public transport, especially Mr George, has developed a
fixation on millions and billions of rands. The latest is a report that
tells us that expenditure on roads has to be doubled to R7 billion, just to
halt further deterioration, and that, worst of all, R6 billion per annum,
for 10 years, will be required to reverse the trend.

Yes, it may be true, it may be factual, but where does it get us when we
have a total budget for transport, this year, of R4,69 billion? The
Minister was told earlier that an estimated R10 billion was required
immediately for the upgrading of infrastructure and rolling stock or - this
has said, almost threateningly - there would be no rail services within 15
years.

It may well be so. I will leave it to others to worry about the figures. I
will rather touch on matters that require planning, organisation and a good
measure of common sense. I would say that a good majority of the 40 million
South Africans would prefer to use rail services. I would, both for
commuting and for longer-distance travelling, because it is inexpensive. It
is expensive to use private transport at the moment.

However, rail travel is currently unsafe and unreliable. Just one of
Metrorail's regions is obliged to use R75 million a year on private
security, and that is just one of them. It still loses R120 million on fare
evasions and suffers heavy losses due to severe and costly vandalism and
the theft of cable and signal boxes. As a result of this, commuters arrive
late for work and lose their jobs. There are people who use every means
available to force trains to a halt in order to rob passengers.

What am I saying? I am saying that the need for effective policing of rail
services has become a top priority. I am not expecting the Minister of
Transport to become the Minister of Safety and Security, but I am asking
that he should ask and demand that Cabinet requests the Minister of Safety
and Security to urge volunteers from his large force of 122 000 police to
be trained in the specific skills that are required to protect the
interests of the rail customer. This effort will pay for itself in no time
at all. Spoornet's Mr Jakavula's handsome main line trains, Shosholoza
Meyl, with their bright new livery, will become even more attractive if
this is done.

It will take a mere decision, not millions and billions of rands, and the
enforcement of this decision also, to curb the destruction of the roads
network by the 56 tons of gross mass that we still so readily allow on the
roads. The further overloading of huge freighters over and above these high
tonnages can similarly be stamped out. With specially trained intelligence-
guided squads of police pouncing at the right places and at the right
times, and taking decisive action against wrongdoers, Spoornet will be able
to take the weight off the overburdened road freight carriers. They will
also be able to do so if they are given the same rate rebates on bulk
diesel levies as other nonroad consumers such as the shipping and fishing
industries. Metrorail, similarly, will soon have their customers back.

It will not require millions or billions of rands, in the long-awaited
restructuring of Transnet and other institutions, to eliminate some of the
institutional duplication and overlapping of authority which is so
widespread. For example, the Department of Public Enterprises structure,
Transnet, which is a complex with 22 companies, contracts the SA Rail
Commuter Corporation, which is a Department of Transport creation, as asset
owner and Metrorail for rail operations and maintenance. There is nothing
more debilitating than having more than one authority involved in deciding
a particular issue.

At another level, the Department of Transport appears to be less
involvedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. [Time expired.]

Mrs T P SHILUBANA: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President and hon Minister,
our biggest challenge is best explained in the words of the Minister of
Finance in November 1999, when he said, and I quote:


  This is an emphasis that cannot continue for too long, because the curve
  that describes the decay of inadequately maintained economic assets
  becomes dangerously steep if relative neglect persists beyond a few
  years.

The backlog for repairing South African roads exceeds R53 billion, and much
of it emanates from the 1970s, when the then state president, P W Botha,
redirected the roads maintenance budget to fight what he called the total
onslaught. We acknowledge the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework amount of
R7 billion for all infrastructure, but more is needed to close the gap.
According to some research, the volume of traffic on national roads, as in
1999, increased by 20% over 1998. We have more cars and fewer roads. It
does not take a genius to foresee the consequences of this.

A studying of the funding historically available for national roads under
the control of the agency makes it apparent that despite the fact that
traffic volumes have grown by more than 3% per annum over the past 20
years, funds allocated by Government for national roads need to be
increased. This sustained underfunding has resulted in us living off our
roads assets for the past 10 to 15 years, and we are now facing very
significant costs to try and maintain existing roads at a reasonable
standard and retrieve the backlog in maintenance expenditure.

Added to this fiscal burden, developing countries such as South Africa and
its neighbours face the challenge of providing roads infrastructure as a
step towards socioeconomic development. We congratulate this Government on
the fact that, in recognising the constraints under which we have to ensure
that Government, inter alia, meets basic needs, the agency has developed a
programme for the next 10 years. We believe that the implementation of this
programme, together with the appropriate funding levels as contemplated,
will result in the containment and elimination of the funding backlog.

The main objective of the programme is to facilitate, through the
appropriate channels, acceptance for the implementation of the proposed
toll road expansion programme and related funding plan. This programme
allows the agency to assist Government to obtain maximum leverage without
compromising fiscal integrity. The concession contracts that are currently
under way, that is the public-private partnership, have a good effect in
trying to close the gap.

These concession contracts are: the N4 Maputo development corridor, the N3
toll road project and the N4 platinum toll highway. As already stated by
the hon the Minister, through these projects, approximately R8,8 billion is
invested from the private sector in the country over a period of  30 years,
thus making available this amount to Treasury for allocation elsewhere.

In October 1996, the Governments of South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique
acknowledged that the need for efficient transport infrastructure was
crucial to unlocking the potential of the Lubombo SDI area. This first
major investment by the South African Government in the SDI was for the
upgrading of roads. The National Roads Agency has committed over R200
million on major rehabilitation projects over the past three years and by
mid-2001 all but 50 km of the 375 km of the N2 from Durban to Swaziland
will be in excellent condition.

During this period, contracts amounting to R58 million have been awarded to
nearly 40 SMMEs and the total in wages amounted to about R4 million, which
provided jobs for about 300 people for periods ranging from three months to
over two years. Up to 100% of all routine road maintenance contracts, to
the value of R5 million per year, on the 180 km section from Richard's Bay
to the Pongola River are now executed by four local SMMEs, which have been
developed over the period.

A further seven local SMMEs have been engaged on shorter specialised
contracts. Most of these workers have also been trained in skills that they
can apply in future. However, it is estimated that 100 000 km of access
roads are required to connect rural people to the transport network.

paragraphs follows.)

[A better life for all. During the apartheid period access roads to black
communities were neglected. They were not tarred, but most access roads
that passed through white farms were tarred. For example, there is a road
in the Northern Province, in the Ritavi district, which is an access road
to Tarentaal crossing farms belonging to whites adjacent to the Phalaborwa
and Letsitele road to Giyani.

This road was tarred long ago but it was tarred up to Chief Valoyi's kraal
only. We would like to see this road completed and tarred by the provincial
government. I would also like to congratulate the government on the
upgrading of the access road to the Rain Queen Modjadji V in the Northern
Province. This road was recently tarred at a cost of R6 million. This
happened during the time when the former state president Mr Nelson Mandela
visited the Modjadji area. He suddenly realised that the shortage of good
roads was a serious problem in black communities.

When heavy rains fall, school programmes come to a standstill. People are
unable to reach their places of work or even hospitals because such roads
are not usable. Bridges are sometimes washed away. The upgrading of this
road emphasises the way in which the Government is prepared to improve
people's lives. It is the ANC-led Government that can manage to do that. We
wish that the provincial and central government budgets should be increased
continuously.

I would like to congratulate the Department of Works in the Northern
Province for the construction of a beautiful road between Pietersburg and
Lydenburg.
I support this budget. [Applause.]]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members, may I first recognise my
Kgosi from Madikwe in the North West, Kgosi Sefanyetso, seated right up
there. Thank you.

The Department of Transport has a great responsibility to ensure that the
nation moves safely from one point to the next. In order to be seen to be
delivering a service, the department has to provide roads. As matters
stand, some 20% of nontolled roads are in a state of disrepair and, if no
reconstruction is mounted soon, 71% of roads will be in a similar or worse
condition by 2005.  It needs a really skilful driver to navigate a motor
vehicle through the potholes, and such conditions on our roads are a recipe
for accidents and reduce motor vehicles to wrecks.

The national, provincial and local roads continue to decline as a result of
insufficient funding from the Government for the maintenance, repair and
upgrading of these roads. Even the Minister has just stated that, were it
not for the private sector, the picture would be grimmer.

There has been much talk about the curbing of violence in the taxi
industry. Yet people continue to die like flies as a result of violence
associated with taxis. Taxi ranks have turned into bloodbaths. The
situation in Umtata in the Eastern Cape, Diepsloot and Orange Farm in
Gauteng and Zeerust in the North West province are examples of continued
bloodletting. The closure of ranks, as is the case at Diepkloof and Orange
Farm, results in more problems as commuters lumber up the roads without any
alternative transport, as the promised buses do not turn up in time.

The issue of taxi recapitalisation keeps receding like a mirage. Newly
designed vehicles, 18 to 35 seaters, were suppose to hit the road in
October last year, but up to this point there is no sign of the replacement
of the 126 000 taxis. The R3 billion which was approved last year has,
according to the Minister this afternoon, risen to R4 billion. This means
that it will keep on rising the more the whole exercise is delayed. There
has to be faster movement in this direction.

Buses continue to be involved in accidents and kill people, and this in
spite of the 100 km/h speed limit imposed on such vehicles. Such accidents
can be attributed to speeding and nonvisibility of traffic officers, as
well as ineffective checks by these officers. They allow these dirty,
rickety and unroadworthy mobile mass coffins to travel on public roads and
cause death.

What incenses me is that some of the buses belong to companies that receive
subsidies from Government, while others, such as the North West Star, are
owned by Government. Yet poor commuters are essentially left without help.
In winter they are exposed to the cold, as windows on some of these buses
are broken. If it rains they virtually have to use umbrellas in the buses.
Yet top employees, executives and directors of these bus companies draw
huge salaries and drive top-of-the-range German saloons, while buses are
not being maintained and thus cause accidents. [Time expired.]

Mr S K LOUW: Madam Speaker, one of the key aspects in the President's state
of the nation address was integrated rural development, which can, no
doubt, be married with an integrated transport system.

Public transport in our country is dominated by disparities in the previous
spacial development, which was the cornerstone of the apartheid regime.
Because of this displacement black people are the ones who travel long
distances to points of economic production and are therefore vulnerable to
changes or reductions in public transport benefits such as subsidies.

Existing public transport in urban areas is not adequately integrated with
working-class suburbs, making travel costly and time-consuming. Our country
needs an integrated transport solution, which will set up a platform for
the sustainable development of freight and passenger solutions. We need to
come up with innovative partnerships between and amongst transport modes to
meet the demands of user needs and the broader community.

Only an integrated transport system will succeed in measuring and capturing
the full economic value of our transport system. We can only then match our
capital outlays with transport users' demands, and we will also be able to
address the inefficiencies and disparities. We also seek to have a freight
rail network which is efficient, sustainable and better able to compete
with road freight an thus enhance export competitiveness. The
internalisation of external costs will then become of importance in
reflecting the cost of transport activities, which should be set on a
competitive platform.

We must make our passenger and commuter rail transport sustainable to such
an extent that it retains the ability to provide low-cost travelling
alternatives to the poor. The intention of the Department of Transport to
further support intermodel and multimodel transport by influencing the
planning of special land use through the National Land Transport Transition
Act, needs to be applauded.

It is transport policies like these that will rewrite the defective plans
of the old apartheid regime and bring about a renewal in our transport
programmes. It is a process like this that will enhance all transport modes
in order to build a better country and ensure a better life for all. The
development of our roads construction will also create an opportunity for
tackling major problems like unemployment and road safety, especially in
rural areas, where the highest rate of pedestrian fatalities occurs. It
will ensure and attract a safe environment for our tourists.

An integrated transport system will only be effective if the current
intelligent transport systems are brought on board to assist in data
collecting through fair ticketing, transport tracking systems, weigh-in-
motion techniques and search and rescue mechanisms which will benefit road
users, suppliers of transport policies and decision-makers.

Another issue is to make sure that the regulatory environment is one which
empowers customers and enables operators to respond to customers. We are
always shocked by the grim toll of death and injury on our roads. I have
therefore been forced to do research to analyse some of these major
fatalities on our roads, especially when it comes to buses. There are
stringent regulations on bus safety, but again it is the enforcement of
these codes that is extremely lax. The department has to jack up its safety
measures. There are serious weaknesses and gaps that need to be filled.

We need to ask this question: Why should buses be sent for inspection only
once a year? Is it not about time to re-examine this kind of regulation?
Why can they not be tested and issued with roadworthy certificates every
six months, or before they undertake a long-distance trip? Testing stations
have become a burning focus point. Corruption at these stations is a normal
part of the procedure nowadays. They do not comply with the necessary
requirements stipulated by the SA Bureau of Standards. It is shocking to
think that a vehicle might not even go to the testing station, but its
roadworthy certificate is a certainty if a bottle of brandy can be
provided, as is the case in Potchefstroom where I live. This kind of
corruption must be rooted out immediately.

I want to compliment and support our MEC, Mr Frans Vilakazi, who took bold
steps to close down some of these stations in the North West. The MEC for
transport in Gauteng, Comrade Mosunkutu, also took the same serious step of
clamping down on these stations. Our Government should not hesitate to take
these actions against such testing stations. According to the Auditor-
General's report, approximately 95% of the recommendations were not
implemented. A driver's licence that was issued was contrary to the
prescriptions of the Act. Such licences are therefore void and have to
cancelled. If such drivers should be involved in an accident, it could have
serious legal consequences for the state.

Mevrou die Speaker, die lewens van elke pendelaar op treine, busse, taxis
of vliegtuie is vir ons kosbaar. Die lewensverliese is te groot en
drastiese stappe om die tekortkominge reg te stel, is van kardinale belang.
Ek wil die Minister en sy departement komplimenteer vir die suksesvolle
pogings wat hulle aangewend het om die slagting op die paaie te voorkom.

Ek wil 'n pleidooi rig aan alle bestuurders en passasiers: Stel die
veiligheid van elke burger eerste. Bestuur versigtig, sonder enige steurnis
van selfone en dies meer. Laat ons die erns om ons paaie te beveilig 'n
nasionale poging van elke burger maak om sodoende die taak van die
verkeerspolisie te vergemaklik. Dit sal ons nie vandag help om te kom kla
soos die agb Odendaal nie. Hy dink soos 'n volstruis met sy kop in die
sand. Ons gaan voorwaarts en ons haak nie vas soos 'n langspeelplaat wat
elke keer hier by die podium kom kla, kom kla, kom kla - en hy gaan nie
voort nie.

Dit is tyd vir die opposisie om te besef dat ons is besig met
transformasie. As hulle nie die beleid van transformasie verstaan nie, moet
hulle dit gaan leer, veral wat die beteken en hoe dit ingestel gaan word.
Dit gaan baie kos, want die apartheidswortels is baie, baie diep gesaai.
Dit gaan 'n massiewe taak wees om dit reg te stel. [Tussenwerpsels.] Baie
dankie vir die regstelling: Dit is baie diepgewortel. [Tyd
verstreke.][Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Madam Speaker, the lives of all commuters on trains, buses, taxis or
aeroplanes are precious to us. The loss of life is too great and drastic
steps to rectify the shortcomings are of the utmost importance. I want to
compliment the Minister and his department for the successful efforts they
have applied to prevent the carnage on our roads.

I want to appeal to all drivers and passengers: Put the safety of citizens
first. Drive carefully, without any interference from cell phones and the
like. Let us make the effort to secure our roads, a national effort of each
and every citizen in order to ease the task of the traffic police. Today it
will not help us to complain as the hon Odendaal is now doing. He thinks
like an ostrich with his head in the sand. We are going forward and we do
not, like a longplaying record that is stuck, come to complain, complain,
complain - and he does not go any further.
It is time for the opposition to realise that we are engaged in
transformation. If they do not understand the policy of transformation,
they must go and learn it, especially what it means and how it will be
implemented. It will take a lot of effort because the apartheid roots are
buried very deep. It will be a massive task to rectify it. [Interjections.]
Thank you very much for the correction: It is deeply rooted. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, Minister, our country has been blessed with
a wonderful set of roads that were previously designed to make life
comfortable for one section of the community. The Minister and the
Department of Transport must be congratulated on providing roads and
infrastructure for the most disadvantaged people over these few years.

In our province, our provincial MEC, the hon J S Ndebele, is doing
wonderful work. Our transport infrastructure is the lifeblood of our
nation, and therefore road maintenance and the provision of new roads are
important. Moreover, our country has to ensure safety on our roads.
Cognisance must be taken of the fact that the transportation of goods on
our roads has increased from 400 operators in 1998 to 4 000 in 2001.
Approximately 80% of the bulk of freight transported in South Africa is
conveyed by road. In this respect the MF compliments the hon the Minister
for the high priority given to regulation and safety. Greater expansion on
a firm basis already commenced in 1994. We are pleased to note that the
department has planned 20 major roads, totalling R5 billion, for the next
two years, and this will also contribute to the economy.

The Minister must be complimented for the discipline that has been brought
into the taxi industry, in spite of the occasional problems. More than half
of the 2,4 million passengers in the urban areas rely on the taxi industry.
In respect of replacing the ageing taxi fleet, may I suggest that the hon
the Minister also look at India Away. The Bhadhjaj and Tata group have
already commenced providing services in South Africa.

As compared to the past, it has been noted that one of the top performers
within the Transnet group has been SAA. It is important for the country
that the issue around the severance package given to the former SAA boss be
settled. There are allegations and counterallegations on which the Minister
of Trade and Industry has also commented. Temperatures are rising, and the
MF suggests that things be cooled down and the country be given the facts.
It was reported over the weekend that British Airways, which is six times
larger than SAA, paid its MD far less.

The MF wishes the hon the Minister of Transport well, and on behalf of
KwaZulu-Natal I appeal for more funds for KwaZulu-Natal. The MF supports
the Vote. [Applause.]

Mr G D SCHNEEMAN: Madam Speaker, Comrade Minister, comrades and hon members
...

... zonke izinsuku izinkulungwane zabantu zihamba ngojantshi ukuya
emsebenzini. Basebenzisa isitimela ngoba asibizi kakhulu futhi siyashesha.
Isitimela sibiza ngaphansi kuka-50% uma sisiqhathanisa netekisi noma
ibhasi. [Ubuwelewele.] [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[... every day thousands of people travel by rail when they go to work.
They travel by train because it is not too expensive and it is quick. The
train costs less than 50% of the fare of buses and taxis. [Interjections.]
[Applause.]]

The market share captured by Metrorail in 1999-2000 was only 18%, compared
to 15% for buses and 60% for taxis. This is partly because commuter rail
provides limited access to commuters as only sections of our cities are
serviced by rail, with large sections of our cities having no access to
rail facilities. I want to inform both Dr Odendaal and Mr Farrow that this
is due to the poor planning policies of the past.

As our city roads become more congested, we need to find ways of moving
traffic off our roads. Commuter rail can provide some of the solutions. It
is fast, cheaper for commuters and environmentally friendly. A recent
Cabinet decision to support a shift in traffic from road to rail and to
level the playing field must be applauded. This is yet another decision
which confirms that the ANC-led Government is on the right track.

Recently, the portfolio committee undertook a number of visits to rail
lines in Cape Town, Pretoria and Johannesburg. During these visits, we were
able to interact with both commuters and management and staff at Metrorail
and the SARCC and gained a better understanding of the commuter rail
experience. The message we received from commuters was that rail was the
cheapest form of transport and that it was also fast and convenient. They
also expressed frustration at frequent delays, the condition of trains, the
lack of communication and the inadequate safety measures in trains. But, at
the same time, they all felt that if solutions to the problems being
experienced could be found, many more commuters would make use of trains.
These members should listen, and then they would find out why.

We were informed by management that the delays were more often than not
caused by vandalism. Acts of vandalism included the stealing of doors and
window frames from coaches and the theft of overhead cables. More recently,
signal systems have been targeted and braking systems on trains tampered
with. This results in the sometimes poor condition of coaches which need to
be withdrawn for repairs, leading to delays due to an insufficient supply
of coaches.

The theft of cables, signals and tampering with braking systems often
results in the complete standstill of the rail service. This was the case
recently on the Naledi line in Johannesburg. A total of 86 signal systems
were stolen, leaving some 300 000 commuters stranded. Much of the theft
which takes place is clearly carried out by organised crime syndicates and
in some instances seems to be deliberate sabotage. Although there have been
successes in arresting many of these criminals, more needs to be done and
will be done by this Government.

According to commuters, some of the private security firms hired to provide
security and safety on our trains do not always perform. In some cases,
security guards sit in the first-class carriages and refuse to respond to
calls from commuters being harassed and sometimes robbed of their
possessions. We call on the security firms to do the work that they have
been hired to do. At the same time, Metrorail should terminate the services
of those who do not perform.

The ageing of the rail infrastructure also causes delays. This is due to
the lack of adequate financing over the last 15 to 20 years. The last new
rail coach was purchased in 1988 and the last commuter rail line was built
in 1984. I want to inform Mr Farrow and Dr Odendaal that they need to
understand that this is the state of the infrastructure that we inherited.
They should stop pretending that South Africa only started to exist in
1994. There was a South Africa before 1994. [Applause.]

Of particular concern is the impact on commuters when there are train
delays. We have heard of commuters who have received final warnings and in
certain cases have lost their jobs. We call on employers to be more
sympathetic and to verify train delays when their staff are late. We also
call on Metrorail to do everything possible to reduce the number of delays
which take place and to set up an effective communication machine with the
business sector.

While these are some of the challenges for which solutions need to be
found, a number of programmes are under way which will help to promote the
use of rail and provide the commuter with an improved and attractive mode
of transport. An ongoing programme of station upgrades is being undertaken
by Intersite. Many of these include the building of shopping centres, taxis
and bus shelters as well as the building of cubicles for emerging
entrepreneurs so that they can start to trade in a decent and protected
environment. At many of these stations, an increase in commuters has been
seen.

The refurbishment of coaches is under way. A programme to upgrade the
signalling system, which is on average 40 years old, is being undertaken.
Rail transport is a much safer form of transport than road transport. Last
year, there were some 350 deaths in train accidents compared to thousands
on our roads. A train comprising 12 coaches can accommodate an average of 1
700 commuters, while around 121 taxis would be required to transport the
same number of people.

The city of Stockholm, which was facing severe traffic congestion on its
roads, decided to promote the use of rail. Train lines were built to link
up with metro lines. In certain instances, new rail lines were built
alongside highways and they saw decreases in traffic as commuters moved
from road to rail transport.

Whilst we see limited funds being made available for rail in this budget,
we look forward to seeing more funds being allocated in the coming years.
We should also understand that there are other equally pressing needs in
our country because of the state of the country we inherited in 1994.
Members should please remember this. We have an infrastructure and we need
to make it work and see it being used to maximum capacity. I am confident
that under the leadership of Minister Omar this will happen.

Ekugcineni, ngithi ngifisa ukududuza imindeni yalabo abangu-13 abashona
ngomhla ka-4 Juni e-DF Malan. [Ihlombe.] [In conclusion, I would like to
sympathise with the families of the 13 people who died on 4 June at DF
Malan. [Applause.]]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Madam Speaker and hon members, the wise thing to
do would be to ignore the hot air which emanated from certain parts of this
House. It is unhelpful. We should rather concentrate on discussing the
problems that we face. The DA is not interested in solving problems. Not
only this, they are bent on obstructing progress, as members have heard
this afternoon. So let us ignore the hot air and concentrate on the many
problems for which they are responsible.

The hon Odendaal is very angry because a few days ago I said he was a relic
of the past. I said that there was a difference between Pretoria and Cape
Town. In Pretoria the statue of Strijdom crashed to the ground, and that
was a relic of the past. I said that right here in this Parliament we have
a living relic of the past. Maybe Parliament has also become a museum. But
I suspect that he is also angry and bitter because we are determined to
take steps against overloading. My eyesight is poor but I think that he
contributes to the overloading problem. But let us be serious. [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

There are a number of very important issues. The first is that there are
budgetary problems. Many members who participated in this discussion
referred to these budgetary problems. We do have budgetary problems. As I
said in my initial input, we need more allocations to address some of the
serious problems of underfunding, which began not in 1994, but more than a
decade before that. That underfunding has to be dealt with.

The matter has been raised, but there are competing demands. We have very
serious housing problems, problems of a lack of schools and problems of a
lack of facilities for our people. There are very many problems that we
need to address. I want to remind the hon member Odendaal that transport is
just one of the issues that we have to address. This is not just an ANC
Government. Maybe the majority in this Government is ANC, but the hon
Minister Buthelezi, who is sitting here, is not an ANC member, and yet he
is a leading member of Government. [Interjections.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: The ANC is dominating him.

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: I think he is insulting the hon the Minister.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: If the Nats could not dominate me, how can
they? [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: This problem goes back many years. The legacy of
apartheid is still with us. Some people do not want to understand that.
They want to close their eyes. Why do they want to close their eyes? It is
because they were responsible for that! [Applause.] So we accept that there
are some competing demands, and I work on the basis that I will not always
get the allocation that I want. Other Ministers work on a similar basis,
and we do not try to palm off the responsibilities on one another.
[Interjections.] They should ask themselves, as I do in my department: What
can we do to relieve some of the burdens that we have and deal with the
budgetary problems?

Of course, there are some hon members on that side of the House who did not
care to listen, but if they did, they would recall that I dealt with the
matter of funding and of finding alternative funding in my address. For
example, I said that we are looking at tolling as a way of addressing the
problem. But this does not mean that one can toll every road. There are no
arbitrary decisions with regard to the tolling of roads. What we are doing
in Government, in the National Road Agency and at provincial government
level is to look at the objects that the roads serve. Some roads serve a
predominantly economic purpose, others serve a predominantly social
purpose. There are roads which serve both social and economic purposes.
Sometimes there are no alternative roads. Those criteria should be taken
into account. Where roads serve a predominantly economic purpose and
alternative roads are available to local populations so that their social
needs can be addressed, then that kind of road would be a candidate for
tolling. That is the criterion that we must address.

There are discussions going on between national and provincial governments.
The hon Farrow, of course, does not know it, but there are discussions with
regard to national Government taking over more roads which are not
classified as national roads at present. But it is not just a matter for
national Government to decide; this has to be done in consultation with
provincial government and sometimes with local government, especially with
the new unicities which have now arisen. Those are big issues arising from
many problems which we have inherited and which are being addressed. But
they are not going to be solved overnight.

The hon Odendaal referred to my saying that our roads are the best in the
world. What I did say was that our national roads are amongst the best in
the world. That is internationally recognised to be the case. But we do
have problems with regard to many other roads, and we are not closing our
eyes to these problems.

With regard to public passenger transport - if I could turn to another
subject - I did not deal with bus transport in my address due to lack of
time, but that is a matter receiving attention. In fact, under the National
Land Transport Transition Act, a number of steps have already been taken.
Many of the big companies have agreed - and I am happy that we can do
things through consensus - to transform the lifelong permits to five-year
permits. Of course, there is a price to be paid. Some compromises have been
made, but we are moving over away from these lifelong permits to tendered
contracts which will be awarded at five-yearly intervals.

Secondly, in the bus industry we have taken steps to end the monopoly which
exists and to open the industry to small bus operators, particularly those
from the historically disadvantaged sector. [Applause.] That process is
taking place right here in the Western Cape and in other provinces, and
over the next few years, more of our people, the historically excluded,
will be participating in the bus industry. [Applause.] What is more, in
terms of the arrangements that are now being developed, the taxi industry
will be involved in the bus industry as well. That is why we are moving
towards 35-seater taxis so as to make it possible for taxi operators to
move into the bus sector as well.

Historically, there is a sharp division between the minibus taxi industry,
which has always been a stepchild of the system, and the bus industry. What
we are doing now is to create an integrated transport system so that we
have a minibus taxi industry and a bus industry with greater movement and
flexibility. They can then move into it themselves. All this is part of
empowerment.

But we also recognise that trains are very important because they are
safer. Trains will resolve many other problems. This will relieve the
burden on our roads. That is why we are looking at infrastructure, at the
rolling stock and at the signalling system in improving our stations. There
are many other examples which I cannot cite at this time.

Lastly, let me indicate that the taxi processes are on course. I know there
is violence. I know that there are problems that arise from day to day and
that those problems cannot just be solved overnight. But they are being
addressed. The big problem is policing. Hon members referred to some
aspects of policing. Some referred to traffic policing and others referred
to railway policing. But with regard to the taxi industry, there are
problems with policing at stations, on trains and on our roads.

In transport there is a big problem in relation to policing. Cabinet
discussed this matter less than a week ago, and there is consultation
taking place between ourselves and the SA Police Service and with Minister
Steve Tshwete so that we address transport policing issues generally.
Hopefully, we can begin to come up with a blueprint and a solution which we
can implement on an incremetal basis.

I should like to thank hon members very much. I thought this was a lively
interaction, but it was all in the spirit of democracy. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 18:57.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises on Visit to
     UK, dated 21 February 2001:


     The Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises, having visited the
     United Kingdom (London) from 1 to 8 July 2000, reports as follows:


     A.  Introduction


         1.  Delegation


              The delegation consisted of Mr S T Belot, chairperson; Mr S L
              E Fenyane (chairperson of the NCOP Select Committee on Labour
              and Public Enterprises); Ms N D Ngcengwane; Mr V G Smith; Mr
              B A D Martins; Ms R Taljaard; Mr M D Msomi; Dr W A Odendaal;
              Mr C T Frolick; Mrs E N Lubidla; Ms B N Dlulane; Mr L G Lever;
              Mr J Horne; and Mr T C Thisani (Committee Secretary).
         2.  Purpose of visit


              The Committee was invited by the Defence and Diversification
              Agency (DDA) to visit and inspect its operations. The DDA is a
              subsidiary of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency
              (DERA). The DDA is part of DERA, created by the British
              government to encourage, foster and facilitate the cross-
              fertilisation of technology transfer between civil and defence
              sectors. Their operations bear resemblance to those of Denel
              in South Africa. The visit helped to compare the programs of
              the DDA to the South African restructuring programme, with
              special comparison to Denel.


     B.  Visit to DERA Farnborough - 3 July 2000


         The delegation was accompanied by Mr John Owen of DERA, and met by
         Prof D McDonnel, Director of the DDA.


         1.  Presentation - DDA and DERA


              (1) DERA


                  DERA is the primary source of technological advice and
                  support to the Ministry of Defence. It is currently
                  managing assets worth one billion pounds and employs 11
                  000 people. One of their major activities is defence
                  procurement programmes. In addition to its mission,
                  DERA's considerable research and development facilities
                  are being made available through the DDA to support UK
                  wealth and job creation.


                  Through DERA, the UK Defence Force has invented a great
                  number of the world's leading edge technologies. Although
                  the inventions have been successfully innovated by
                  technology transfer (along the defence equipment value
                  chain), considerable wealth and job creation
                  opportunities have been missed through insufficient
                  innovation (along the civil sector value chain). A
                  conservative estimate of the missed business value is
                  about 100 billion pounds.
              (2) DDA


                  The DDA has been created to promote the interchange of
                  technology originating from either the defence or civil
                  sector for maximum value extraction through innovation in
                  both sectors. Getting the most out of defence technology
                  is the DDA's mission.


                  The three main aims of the DDA are the following:


                  (a) To encourage the widest exploitation possible in the
                       civil sector of defence technology.


                  (b) To provide information on defence equipment
                       procurements and trends in order to inform the
                       defence industry's own diversification planning.


                  (c) To facilitate sector spin-in to military programmes.


                  The British government realises that the key to success
                  is greater co-operation between science and business. The
                  virtuous cycle, of science to invention to innovation to
                  business and back to new market-driven science, is
                  spiralling in continuous innovation.


                  One of the areas the DDA can be proud of, is technology
                  transfer. The following examples serve to illustrate that
                  view:


                  Power transistors


                  DERA has provided a competitive edge to the existing
                  technology. The power transistor is capable of 50% more
                  power and 25% more bandwidth than the current transistor.


                  "Sea Machine"


                  DERA technology has assisted the design and development
                  of high powered marine vessels, with a focus on efficient
                  hull design, material strength, small arms weapon
                  protection and stealth. The DDA is assisting in the
                  transfer of this technology for police, coastguard and
                  military roles.


                  Car security


                  They are using DERA's world-class expertise in the field
                  of voice recognition systems to revolutionise car
                  security. This technology will replace keys with speech
                  patterns.


                  Marine industry


                  The DDA is helping several SMEs in the marine market.
                  This includes projects using defence technology -


                  *   for artificial weather instrumentation on luxury
                       yachts;


                  *   to develop forward-looking sonar for wreck detection;
                       and


                  *   to assist in the design of commercial underwater
                       vehicles.


                  Water filtration


                  DERA and a Hampshire-based SME is working on a mobile
                  water filtration system. The aim is to develop a system
                  for transportation on a Land Rover or a similar vehicle.
                  DERA is assisting with the chemical components of the
                  process.


                  TyreSafe


                  TyreSafe is a remarkable new puncture sealant system,
                  using rubber and non-toxic biodegradable chemicals to
                  provide a powerful, safe and permanent sealing. With
                  obvious benefits to the Ministry of Defence and the UK
                  Armed Forces, the DDA has assisted in the transfer of
                  this technology to Defence.


                  Flat-panel Speakers


                  This technology will help reduce the size of speakers
                  without reducing output.


         2.  Presentation by Mr K C McLean (PMC Business Group) on
              Tradewinds


              Mr McLean emphasised that this initiative was not government
              policy, but an initiative that could be developed further
              through co-operation with the South African government. The
              initiative had its foundations in fourth generation
              technology. It focused on a wide range of activities that
              would ultimately filter down to SMEs. This would ensure that
              all partners win and also meet South Africa's special needs.


         3.  Presentation by Dr K Murphy on Concealed Weapon Detection
              DERA has developed a concealed weapon detection system which
              allowed operators to locate potential threats without arousing
              suspicion. Weapons such as guns and knives are fairly
              straightforward to hide on a person, and it is generally not
              practical, legal or safe for law enforcement officers to stop
              and search at will. This technology addresses this problem by
              allowing remote, covert, scanning of suspects. In this way the
              law enforcement officer is able to detect potential threats
              without arousing suspicion.


              The nature of the technology means that it cannot be detected
              by emission. The imagers can be hidden behind special
              surfaces, which are strong and visibly opaque but transparent
              to Passive Millimetre Wave Imaging (PMMW). This allows the
              imagers to be concealed in vehicles or behind false walls.


              DERA is prepared to negotiate technology transfer on this
              system with South Africa. Permission can be sought to provide
              the equipment in South Africa via an offset route. At the
              moment only two countries have the capability of producing the
              system.


     C.  Visit to GKN Wesland on 4 July 2000 - host: J Falkner


         GKN is a privately-owned company that was initially involved in
         the manufacturing of cars. It is the 50th biggest company in the
         world and operates in over 40 countries. The annual turnover is
         about three billion pounds. The industry employs 33 000 people in
         its subsidiary companies and a further 11 000 in associated
         companies.


         GKN would like Denel to be a partner, and detailed discussions are
         taking place. Integrated project teams are currently thrashing out
         details. The teams are equipped with different expertise such as
         finance manufacturing. This will result in what is usually termed
         "smart procurement".


         1.  Super Lynx 300


              South Africa is in discussion with GKN on the possibility of
              buying Lynx helicopters. The negotiations also include the
              possibility of South Afria being a major supplier of Lynx
              parts to Nigeria and other countries. The advantages of
              employing Lynx services are the following:


              (1) It extends the range of naval influence in operational
                  waters by a factor of 10.


              (2) It will enable the SANDF to enforce national and
                  international law throughout its area of responsibility.


              (3) It can conduct day or night operations, including civil
                  search and rescue, in massive seawater swells.


         2.  Programme schedule


              The optimum period for manufacturing and commissioning Super
              Lynx, ready for service, is five years. This period is divided
              as follows:
              (1) Aircraft design and building activity (43 months).


              (2) Aircrew conversion training in UK (three months).


              (3) Delivery to South Africa (one month).


              (4) Test-flying development centre work (nine months).


              (5) Aircrew operational training (five months).


              (6) First operation to be embarked upon (one month).

     D.  Visit to British Aerospace Systems (BAe) - 5 July 2000


         In attendance were Mr N Franks (BAe), Mr R Neil (BAe), Mr R Rue
         (BAe), Mr S Mcintyre (BAe) and Mr N Fisher (DESO).


         BAe was formed in 1977. Its core business involves system
         solutions and managing large and complicated programmes. There is
         no government involvement in the running of BAe, other than one
         pound special or golden share. A framework was there during its
         formation for the company to be run privately. The following are
         the milestones of BAe:


         1.  1977 - formed as a nationalised corporation by merger of
              British Aircraft Corporation, Hawker Siddeley Aviation, Hawker
              Siddeley Dynamics and Scottish Aviation.


         2.  1981 - formed as plc with assets of nationalised corporation
              HMG sell 51,57% of shares (with 15% shareholding limit).


         3.  1985 - HMG sell remaining shares (maintaining special one
              pound share to ensure UK control).


         4.  1987 - acquired newly privatised Royal Ordinance.


         BAe Systems operations are split, as follows:


         * Customer support   -   13%
         * Major programmmes  -   22%
         * International partnerships    -   12%
         * Commercial aircraft     -    23%
         * Avionics     -    8%
         * Electronics & software  -    12%
         * Operations   -    10%


         Benefits of privatisation


         * Incentives to much greater efficiency.
         * Access to private sector capital.
         * Form international partnerships.
         * Long-term perspective facilitates strategic planning.


         BAe maintains a presence in the USA, Europe and other countries.
         It is also involved in industrial participation in South Africa,
         and that kind of involvement is spreading to other parts of
         Africa.


     E.  Visit to Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO) - 6 July 2000


         In attendance (from DESO): Mr B J Teideman , Mr P Gareth, Mr M
         Murphy, Mr J Morrison and Mr J Hawkins (DERA).


         DESO is an integral part of the UK Ministry of Defence, that acts
         as a focal point within the British government for all defence
         export-related activities. Its mission is to maximise legitimate
         UK Defence export in co-ordination with industry. Its vision is to
         be the world's best government defence export organisation. DESO's
         role is to provide assistance to British Defence companies and to
         overseas customers interested in acquiring British Defence
         products. It can assist British companies involved in the export
         market in a number of ways, including -


         1.  briefing companies new to defence exporting;


         2.  bringing overseas customers and UK suppliers together;


         3.  advising UK firms on Defence market prospects on a worldwide,
              regional or country basis;


         4.  providing professional military advice and assistance in
              support of sales;


         5.  organising Defence exhibitions, inward missions and equipment
              demonstrations, both in the UK and overseas;


         6.  ensuring that overseas sales considerations are given due

         Assistance to small and medium enterprises (SMEs)


         The full range of DESO assistance is available to SMEs. Within
         each of DESO's four Regional Marketing Directorates (RMD) there is
         a Small Business Focal Point (SBFP). The SBFPs act as liaison
         officers for SMEs to ensure that they are pointed in the right
         direction, that they receive an appropriate level of service and
         support from RMD desk officers and that their interests are
         represented to those travelling overseas and to DESO higher
         management. Within their respective RMDs the SBFPs provide general
         marketing advice for their regions, including the requirement for
         agents and translations.


         The delegation was also briefed by Mr B J Teideman on the aspects
         of offset programmes. In addition, the delegation had a chance to
         hold a meeting with the Defence Select Committee. A wide range of
         Defence-related issues were discussed.

              manufacturing workshare is that it is the single source
              supplier of the RB211 gearbox that powers the B757 and TU204
              aircraft. Rolls Royce has asked Denel for a proposal on how

              the total military package to sign a Strategic Partnership
              Agreement. Even though the aircraft are not delivered until
              2003, Rolls Royce has already started to place orders to
              honour the offset commitment. Denel will be the single source
              supplier for complete gearboxes for the Tay engine. Rolls
              Royce's offset to support the Hawk sale to South Africa is the
              most comprehensive offset programme ever offered by Rolls
              Royce.

     A.  8 May - presentation on restructuring in Transnet by Mr S S
         Ntsaluba, Executive Director: Restructuring


         1.  Transnet's restructuring objectives


              (1) Improving operational efficiency and asset utilisation.


              (2) Ensuring provision of quality service.


              (3) Transfer of expertise and technology to business units.


              (4) Transfer of risks to/sharing of risks with private sector.


              (5) Realisation of value.


              (6) Attraction of international investors with wide skills
                  set.


         2.  Impact of process of restructuring on economy


              (1) Develop infrastructure.


              (2) Facilitate economic growth.


              (3) Mobilise private sector capital.


              (4) Reduce State debt.


              (5) Create wider ownership in the economy.


         3.  Impact of process of restructuring on company


              (1) To evolve as a holding company with interest in various
                  developed core businesses.


              (2) To shift from being a sole provider of infrastructure to
                  an integrated transport operator.


              (3) To create new business opportunities, growth and value.


              (4) To improve in productivity, efficiency and cost-
                  effectiveness.


         4.  Impact of process on people


              Loss of employment results when companies are restructured
              with a view to being turned around. This is seen as a
              temporary yet necessary step. If not managed in this manner,
              it is bound to happen nevertheless. The restructuring office
              at Transnet is working closely with the Social Plan Unit to
              ensure that the negative impact of restructuring is minimised.


         5.  Timeframes for restructuring


              All businesses under Transnet will be restructured from 2000
              to 2003.


     B.  Introduction to Portnet by Mr S J Macozoma, Managing Director:
         Transnet LTD


         1.  Background


              In 1997 Portnet was experiencing a scissors effect in that it
              was losing money as a result of a raise in expenditure and a
              drop in revenue. Portnet therefore launched a turnaround
              strategy in June 1998, aimed at upgrading operations, finance,
              marketing and human resources, and introducing a
              divisionalisation system, which entailed splitting into Port
              Authority and Port Operations divisions. Most upgrades have
              been completed in the major business units at the Port
              Authority.


         2.  Divisionalisation


              Divisionalisation is the way forward for Portnet, and entails
              the following:


              (1) Internal reorganisation of businesses and realignment of
                  business goals.


              (2) Port Authority to provide port infrastructure and marine
                  services.


              (3) Port Operations to provide competitive cargo handling and
                  other related services.


              (4) Focus on creating autonomous, self-sufficient business
                  units in the Port Operations division.


         3.  Challenges


              Implementing recommendations from Phase 1 of the turnaround
              strategy - expansion of operational infrastructure:


              (1) Rightsizing of asset base


                  Introducing modern technology in operations, etc;
                  creating customer relationship management systems;
                  implementing modern information systems appropriate to
                  the ports industry; and revitalising Portnet staff by
                  providing education and development programmes, creating
                  capacity for pilots and port captains through
                  international training programme and sustaining a
                  performance management culture.


     C.  9 May - presentation on Metro Rail by Mr H Mateya, Chief Executive
         Officer


         1.  Background


              Metrorail forms part of the big seven transport units under
              Transnet Limited.


         2. Vision


              Metro Rail is the preferred rail commuter operator.


         3.  Mission


              To render a safe, effective, efficient and affordable rail
              commuter service and operate the public metropolitan rail
              system in partnership with all stakeholders, with a total
              journey focus, based on commuter needs.


         4.  Structure


              In 1994-95 Metro Rail had a staff complement of 12 000, which
              was decreased - at present it is 8 500.


         5.  Performance


              (1) Metro Rail's performance has increased between 1997 and
                  2000.


              (2) In 1998 its fare income was R560 825 125, and in 2000 it
                  stood at R686 903 119.


              (3) In 1998 it made a profit of R40 712 403 and in 2000 it was
                  R117 295 108.


         6.  Transport: Central to development


              Metro Rail's view is that transport is the lifeblood of our
              economy. It is one of the five critical priorities of the
              government. Therefore its importance to the economic success
              of South Africa cannot be overstated.


              Metro Rail has developed a five-point strategy for growing the
              business:


              (1) Improving customer care.


              (2) Growing the revenue base.


              (3) Upgrading the asset base within its control.


              (4) Continue to reduce costs.


              (5) Creating partnerships with staff and providing them with
                  incentives to perform.


     D.  Port of Richard's Bay - presentation by Mr S Gama, Chief Executive
         Officer: Port Authority


         1.  Background


              In May 1971 Parliament authorised the construction of the Port
              of Richard's Bay. It opened on 1 April 1976. In 1976 it
              handled 82 vessels and 4,2 million tons. In 1999 it had more
              than 1 700 vessels and handled in excess of 80 million tons.
              It makes up 55% of South Africa's seaborne cargo trade.


         2.  Developments


              The Port of Richard's Bay consists of a number of local
              industries: Billiton Hillside Smelter; Richards Bay Minerals;
              Mondi Kraft Mill; Indian Ocean Fertilizers; Three Woodchip
              Plants; Terminals.


     E.  Richard's Bay Coal Terminal


         This terminal is privately operated and is the largest export
         terminal in the world. It has a capacity of 66,5 million tons and
         presently exports about 63 million tons. It was to handle its
         billionth ton in 2000.


         1.  Island View Storage


              This terminal is privately operated by Richard's Bay bulk
              storage, and imports and exports bulk liquids and liquified
              gases.


              It is a multi-purpose plant that imports and exports dry bulk
              ores and minerals. Its conveyor belt network is over 40 km
              long and is linked to the terminal. 67% of its income is
              obtained by local means. Its upgrade capacity is from 11
              million to 18 million ton per annum.


         2.  Portnet's two General Cargo Terminals


              Combi Terminal: Dealing with the transportation of forest
              products, ferro alloys and pig iron aluminum.


              Bulk Metal Terminal: Dealing with the transportation of steel
              and granite.


         3.  Future developments


              The Port of Richard's Bay's capital investments were standing
              at R1,1 billion during the period 1996-2000. R730 million is
              estimated for 2000-02. It is also intending to build a second
              coal terminal, a dry dock and a fruit/passenger terminal.


         4.  Development potential


              The Port of Richard's Bay is South Africa's biggest port, with
              a land surface area of 2 157 ha and a water surface area of
              1 443 ha. Only 40% of the area is developed; there are
              additional areas outside the port, which are reserved for
              future development.


              The delegation was taken on a tour of the facilities of the
              Port of Richard's Bay, which included a tug trip of the bay, a
              visit to the Richard's Bay Coal Terminal and the Woodchip
              Plant. The tour was undertaken by helicopter in order to view
              the site of the Port of Richard's Bay from the air.


              The delegation was transported on the Metro Rail Conference
              Train from Stanger Station to Empangeni Station en route to
              Petronet, Durban.


     F.  Presentation on Petronet by Mr C A Moller, Chief Executive


         1.  Background


              Petronet was established in 1965. It owns, maintains and
              operates a network of some 3 000 km of high pressure petroleum
              and gas pipelines. It provides 100% of transportation of bulk
              petroleum by pipeline in South Africa. During the 1998-99
              financial year, Petronet transported through its network a
              total of some 16 billion liters of fuel. This includes diesel,
              leaded and unleaded petrols, aviation turbine fuel and crude
              oil. Gas throughput for the financial year was 2 000 million
              cubic metres.


              The pipelines range from six inches (150mm) to 20 inches
              (508mm) in diameter. Products are transported through the
              various pipelines at a maximum allowable pressure of up to 100
              bar for petroleum products and 59 bar for gas. Pressure in the
              pipeline is monitored 24 hours a day, in the control centre in
              Petronet's Head Office in Durban.


              Petronet's customers are the major oil companies in south
              Africa, namely BP, Shell, Caltex, Total, Zenex, Sasol Oil and
              Sasol Gas.


         2.  Human resources and structure


              Petronet employs about 660 personnel across the network. It
              has drawn up a plan to ensure that by the year 2003 the
              workforce will be reflective of the demographics of the
              country. Petronet has also embarked on an employee well-being
              programme, whereby all the basic needs such as housing,
              training and development, social issues and employee benefits
              are addressed.


              It has a geographically decentralised structure with two
              regional offices, one in the north at Bedfordview and one in
              the south at Pinetown, responsible for maintenance of assets
              and functional depot logistics. The Head Office is situated in
              Durban and houses the operational control centre and other
              support functions.


         3.  Challenges and issues


              The regulated liquid fuels industry was soon to be deregulated
              by means of the Energy Bill. This would impact on a number of
              complex agreements, guarantees and undertakings. All gas and
              fuel pipelines were to be regulated. The Gas Bill was expected
              in mid-2000 and the Pipeline Regulation Bill at the end of
              2000. Petronet is of the view that one should not regulate
              liquid pipelines in a highly regulated industry, but the
              Department of Minerals and Energy does not necessarily agree.


              Petronet does not face competition from the road but is still
              losing volumes to the road as a result of the principle of
              total cost.


              The Department of Minerals and Energy did not implement a 4%
              Petronet tariff increases for the year 2000.


              Too high tax and tariffs: Petronet can only corporatise with
              revised tax laws, or postpone corporatisation while still 100%
              State-owned.


     G.  10 May - presentation on Esselenpark Centre of Excellence by Ms B
         Dibate, Chief Executive Officer


         1.  Background


              The Esselenpark Centre of Excellence is an independent unit of
              Transnet and its subsidiaries. It is an institution dedicated

              and Management and Supervisory Development.


         2.  Vision


              Esselenpark is a dynamic and preferred partner in the
              provision of market-driven organisational and people
              development solutions.


         3.  Mission


              Esselenpark is a preferred partner in the provision of market-
              driven hospitality services, organisational and people
              development solutions.


         4.  Strategic objectives


              Esselenpark is committed to achieving its mission through -


              (1) creating a culture of service excellence;


              (2) building operation capability by exporting industry-
                  relevant experience through joint ventures and
                  partnerships;


              (3) new customer drive and retention through accelerated new
                  product/service development;
              (4) alignment and compliance with all legislation that seek to
                  promote gender equity and people development.


              While Esselenpark's main focus is training, there are
              developments within the industry that negatively impact on the
              Centre's long-term sustainability. Examples of these
              developments are training migration to IT and training on
              site. For this reason, Esselenpark will in the next five years
              be repositioned into two operational units, namely
              Organisational and Human Resources Development, and
              Hospitality and Property Management.


         5.  Strategic options - Organisational and Human Resource
              Development


              (1) Align training to NQF requirements.


              (2) Offer career-path training.


              (3) Export new capabilities through joint ventures and
                  partnerships with other tertiary institutions.


              (4) Application of multi-media technology to increase training
                  effectiveness (virtual classroom).


              (5) Exploit Skills Development Act opportunities for training
                  and development.


         6.  Strategic options - Hospitality and Property Management


              To transfer hospitality and property management into a viable
              and sustainable business by -


              (1) building operational capability through exporting relevant
                  industry expertise;


              (2) attract and retain new clients through superior service
                  delivery and upgrade facilities in line with customer
                  expectation;
              (3) consolidate Esselenpark's position as a "one-stop and pre-
                  eminent venue" for all hospitality requirements.


         7.  Recent success


              Restructuring took place without negative industrial relation
              issues. Black Economic Empowerment rose from 15% to 47% of
              total Esselenpark expenditure. Esselenpark was the first
              institution in Africa to launch virtual classroom training
              methodology in line with global trends. Esselenpark hosted a
              number of high-profile events like the Alzheimer International
              Conference. Outsourcing took place to small, medium and micro
              enterprises. The delegation went on a tour of the facilities
              attached to the Esselenpark Centre of Excellence.


     H.  Presentation of SAA by Mr C Andrews, Chief Executive Officer and
         President


         1.  Background
              18 months ago the SAA suffered several fatal flaws in its
              strategy, operations, organisation and culture. Amongst other
              problems, they had a severe weakness in revenue management, no
              fleet strategy, limited alliances and pockets of corruption
              operating from within.


         2.  New strategy adopted


              (1) Since 18 months ago the SAA -


                  (a) has sharply improved customer services;


                  (b) has introduced a new first and business class
                       product;


                  (c) has upgraded its fleet;


                  (d) has entered into powerful alliances that would be
                       profitable;


                  (e) has had dramatic revenue management gains; and


                  (f) has had a substantial cost reduction.


         3.  The SAA has managed to reduce costs in a number of ways:


              (1) It has had approximately 1 300 voluntary departures or
                  retrenchments.


              (2) There were overhead reductions as a result of programme-
                  spending cuts.


              (3) Money-losing routes were fixed or eliminated.


              The SAA's previous international network had major structural
              flaws and served only 70 destinations. It is built on strong
              alliances - the new network now serves 503 destinations. They
              are currently looking at modernising and simplifying the fleet
              to cut costs, gain product advantage and eliminate
              complexities. During 1999 the SAA was operating at a non-
              profit of R130 million, while in 2000 it was making a profit
              of R573 million. The value of SAA equity in June 1998 was R1,5
              billion; the value increased dramatically, so that by June
              1999 it was at R6,9 billion.


         4.  Service


              The SAA is said to be setting the world class standard for on-
              time performances and is a finalist for the Airline of the
              Year 2000.


         5.  SAA composition


              By 15 June 1998 the statistics of the leadership structure
              (out of 13 individuals) of the SAA was 69% white, 15% black,
              8% coloured, 8% Asian and 0% international. On 8 February
              2000, the leadership structure (out of 15 candidates) looked
              as follows: 28% white; 33% black; 14% coloured; 7% Asian; and
              20% international.


              Objectives: To build a team-oriented culture that fosters
              effective and harmonious collaboration between members of all
              sectors of the South African society.


              To accomplish greater inclusion of and advancement by members
              of previously disadvantaged groups in the successful
              development of the SAA.


         6.  Set powerful example at top


              Who makes up the leadership team? How many members of the team
              work together? What does the team do to achieve the two
              transformation objectives"?


         7.  Retain and promote talent


              (1) Recognising and rewarding staff accomplishments privately
                  and publicly,


              (2) Build broad expertise in multiple areas.


         8.  Use effective tools


              (1) Identify and recruit superior talent.


              (2) Seek out the best talent in the company and the nation.


              (3) Make the SAA a magnet for high achievers.


         9.  Train and develop


              (1) Start with the high potential talent and then use
                  accelerated real work experiences to see who qualifies
                  for a leadership role in the SAA.


              (2) Formal training for the leadership team, for example MBA
                  programmes.

         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development
         is hereby requesting the permission of the House in terms of Rule
         230(1) for the introduction of the following legislation in the
         House:-


         (a) Particulars of the proposed legislation


              The legislation will comprise a Criminal Procedure Amendment
              Bill, and will be aimed at substituting section 170A of the
              Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 (Act No. 51 of 1977), by the
              following section (words underlined indicate insertions in the
              existing section):


              "Evidence through intermediaries


                170A. (1) Whenever criminal proceedings are pending before
              any court and it appears to such court that it would expose
              any witness under the age of eighteen years to undue mental
              stress or suffering if he or she testifies at such
              proceedings, the court may, subject to subsection (4), appoint
              a competent person as an intermediary in order to enable such
              witness to give his or her evidence through that intermediary.
                (2)(a) No examination, cross-examination or re-examination
              of any witness in respect of whom a court has appointed an
              intermediary under subsection (1), except examination by the
              court, shall take place in any manner other than through that
              intermediary.
                (b) The said intermediary may, unless the court directs
              otherwise, convey the general purport of any question to the
              relevant witness.
                (3) If a court appoints an intermediary under subsection
              (1), the court may direct that the relevant witness shall give
              his or her evidence at any place -
              (a) which is informally arranged to set that witness at ease;
              (b) which is so situated that any person whose presence may
                  upset that witness, is outside the sight and hearing of
                  that witness; and
              (c) which enables the court and any person whose presence is
                  necessary at the relevant proceedings to see and hear,
                  either directly or through the medium of any electronic
                  or other devices, that intermediary as well as that
                  witness during his or her testimony.
                (4)(a) The Minister may by notice in the Gazette determine
              the persons or the category or class of persons who are
              competent to be appointed as intermediaries.
                (b) An intermediary who is not in the full-time employment
              of the State shall be paid such travelling and subsistence and
              other allowances in respect of the services rendered by him or
              her as the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister of
              Finance, may determine.
                (5)(a) No oath, affirmation or admonition which has been
              administered through an intermediary in terms of section 165
              shall be invalid and no evidence which has been obtained
              through an intermediary shall be inadmissible solely on
              account of the fact that such intermediary was not competent
              to be appointed as an intermediary in terms of a regulation
              referred to in subsection (4)(a), at the time when such oath,
              affirmation or admonition was administered or such evidence
              was presented.
                (b) If in any proceedings it appears to a court that an
              oath, affirmation or admonition was administered or that
              evidence has been obtained through an intermediary who was
              appointed in good faith but, at the time of such appointment,
              was not qualified to be appointed as an intermediary in terms
              of a regulation referred to in subsection (4)(a), the court
              must make a finding as to the validity of that oath,
              affirmation or admonition or the admissibility of that
              evidence, as the case may be, with due regard to -
                (i)  the reason why the intermediary concerned was not
              qualified to be appointed as an intermediary, and the
              likelihood that the reason concerned will affect the
              reliability of the evidence so presented adversely;
                (ii)  the mental stress or suffering which the witness, in
              respect of whom that intermediary was appointed, will be
              exposed to if that evidence is to be presented anew, whether
              by the witness in person or through another intermediary; and
                (iii) the likelihood that real and substantial justice will
              be impaired if that evidence is admitted.
                (6)(a) Subsection (5) does not prevent the prosecution from
              presenting anew any evidence which was presented through an
              intermediary referred to in that subsection.
                (b) The provisions of subsection (5) shall also be
              applicable in respect of all cases where an intermediary
              referred to in that subsection has been appointed, and in
              respect of which, at the time of the commencement of that
              subsection -
                (i)   the trial court; or
                (ii)  the court considering an appeal or review,
                has not delivered judgment.".


         (b) Objects of the proposed legislation


              1.  In terms of section 170A of the Criminal Procedure Act,
                  1977 (Act No. 51 of 1977) (the Act), a court may, if it
                  is of the opinion that a witness under the age of
                  eighteen years will be exposed to undue mental stress or
                  suffering if he or she testifies at criminal proceedings,
                  appoint a "competent person" as an intermediary in order
                  to enable the witness to give his or her evidence through
                  that intermediary. Section 170A was inserted into the Act
                  in 1991, to protect specifically the interests of young
                  persons and children who have to testify in sensitive
                  cases such as rape, indecent assault and child abuse.


              2.  The Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development
                  may by notice in the Gazette determine the persons or the
                  category or class of persons who are competent to be
                  appointed as intermediaries.


                  * A list of categories of persons who are competent to be
                    appointed as intermediaries was subsequently published
                    in Government Notice No R1374 of 30 July 1993. This
                    Notice was amended by Government Notice No R360 of 28
                    February 1997.


                  * One of the categories fixed in terms of this Notice is
                    that of "...educators in terms of the Educators'
                    Employment Act, 1994 (Proclamation No 138 of 1994), who
                    have four years experience in teaching and who have not
                    at any stage, for whatever reason, been suspended or
                    dismissed from service in teaching".


                  * The Educators' Employment Act, 1994, was, however,
                    repealed by the Employment of Educators Act, 1998 (Act
                    No 76 of 1998). In terms of the definition of
                    "educator" contained in this 1998 Act, an educator
                    must, amongst others, be "...appointed in a post on any
                    educator establishment under this Act".


              3.  In a review judgment delivered on 13 March 2001, the Cape
                  Town High Court held that former (and retired) teachers
                  do not fall within the new definition of "educators" and
                  they are therefore not competent to be appointed as
                  intermediaries. (S v Bongani; Case No 20006077). This
                  ruling will have a profound and adverse effect on the
                  significant number of cases which are part-heard and in
                  which former or retired educators were appointed as
                  intermediaries. It is particularly distressing to note
                  that vulnerable witnesses, in respect of whom
                  intermediaries were appointed to protect them from
                  exposure to undue mental stress or suffering when they
                  testified at criminal proceedings, will through no fault
                  of their own be required to repeat their testimony,
                  whether in person or through another intermediary. It is
                  believed that there are approximately 46 such part-heard
                  cases in the Western Cape alone, and several hundred such
                  cases across the country.


              4.  The Bill aims therefore to amend section 170A of the
                  Criminal Procedure Act, 1977, in order to determine a
                  procedure to be followed by a court when it appears that
                  evidence has been presented through an intermediary who,
                  although appointed as an intermediary in good faith, was
                  not competent to be appointed as such an intermediary.


         (c) Financial implications for the State


              The proposed legislation will not lead to any additional
              expenditure for the State.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Interim Report of the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members'
     Interests with regard to the complaint against Mr T S Yengeni MP


     1. BACKGROUND


     1.1 On the basis of a report in the Sunday Times, 25 March 2001, Mr D
         Gibson, MP lodged a complaint with the Chairperson of the Joint
         Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests in respect of alleged
         non-disclosure by Mr T S Yengeni, MP.


     1.2 At its meeting on 28 March 2001, the Committee instructed the
         Registrar to request a response from Mr Yengeni to Mr Gibson's
         letter of complaint.
     2. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MR YENGENI AND THE OFFICE OF THE REGISTRAR OF
         MEMBERS' INTERESTS WITH REGARD TO THE COMPLAINT


     2.1 The Registrar, as instructed by the Committee, sent a letter to Mr
         Yengeni on 30 March 2001.


     2.2 Mr Yengeni responded on 6 April 2001. In his response to the
         Registrar, Mr Yengeni questioned whether the relevant rules and
         procedures had been followed.


     2.3 In consultation with the Chairperson and on the basis of legal
         opinion obtained from the Chief Parliamentary Law Adviser, a
         second letter, dated 10 April 2001, was sent to Mr Yengeni
         informing him that the letter of the 30 March 2001 was sent on the
         instruction of the Committee and that he is required to respond.


     2.4 On 10 April 2001 the Registrar received a letter from Mr Yengeni's
         personal assistant indicating that Mr Yengeni would only be in a
         position to respond after 2 May 2001 as Parliament was in recess.


     2.5 The Registrar subsequently received a response from Mr Yengeni on
         18 April 2001. Mr. Yengeni responded to the questions on the
         allegation of non-disclosure of a benefit that he received in
         respect of his motor vehicle and secondly the non-disclosure of
         his home in Tigerhof.


     2.6 Mr Yengeni indicated that he had disclosed his home in 1996 and
         that his understanding of the rules was that a once off disclosure
         was sufficient. With regard to the motor vehicle Mr Yengeni stated
         that the vehicle was legitimately purchased and that its
         acquisition did not in any way amount to a gift or donation and
         therefore there was no need for disclosure.


     3. CONTENT OF THE COMPLAINT


         The complaint submitted by Mr Gibson raised the following matters:


     3.1 That Mr Yengeni did not disclose erf 18250 Cape Town.


     3.2 With regard to motor vehicle CA 80233, that the licensing
         application indicates that Stannic was the financier and that Mr
         Yengeni appears to have received free use of a motor vehicle for a
         period of seven months and that the benefit was not disclosed.


     3.3 That the Committee should consider whether it is appropriate for
         the Chairperson of the Defence Committee to enter into an
         agreement with a company that either itself or whose affiliates
         are or were involved in tendering for arms or sub-contracts.


     4. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS


     4.1 In respect of the alleged non-disclosure of erf 18250 Cape Town.


     4.2 Five members of the Committee were of the view that -


         (a) Mr Yengeni's explanation was not sufficient for them to
              determine the facts; and


         (b) Mr Yengeni therefore should be required to appear at this
              point before the Committee to give an explanation of the
              alleged non-disclosure concerning the acquisition of the motor
              vehicle.


     4.3 The majority view was -


         (a) Mr Yengeni did not comply with the Code;


         (b) Mr Yengeni's non-compliance was not mala fide.


     4.4 Accordingly the Committee recommends that Mr Yengeni must submit
         the details of erf 18250 to the Registrar by 31 May 2001.


         The Committee voted 24 in favour of the majority decision with 5
         against.


     4.5 In respect of the alleged non-disclosure of the benefit of motor
         vehicle CA 80233 as well as the appropriateness of the Chairperson
         of the Defence Committee entering into an agreement with a company
         that either itself or whose affiliates are or were involved in
         tendering for arms or sub-contracts. The Committee deliberated at
         length on these matters.


     4.6 The view of seven members of the Committee was that -


         (a) the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests should
              proceed directly with its own investigation of these matters;


         (b) Mr Yengeni is refusing to cooperate with the Committee, and
              this constitutes contempt of the Committee;


         (c) Mr Yengeni should be required to appear at this point before
              the Committee to give an explanation of the facts concerning
              the acquisition of the motor vehicle.


     4.7 A majority view -
         (a) noted that the allegations contained in the Sunday Times, 25
              March 2001, were made in the context of the Strategic Defence
              Procurement Process;


         (b) further noted that on 2 November 2000 the National Assembly
              accepted the recommendation of the Standing Committee on
              Public Accounts that a forensic investigation be conducted
              into allegations of impropriety in relation to this process;


         (c) further noted the report of the Standing Committee on Public
              Accounts, tabled in and adopted by the National Assembly on 4
              April 2001, that such an investigation is being co-ordinated
              by the Office of the Auditor-General and comprises the Office
              of the Public Protector and the Investigating Directorate for
              Serious Economic Offences in the Office of the National
              Director of Public Prosecutions;


         (d) believes that the subject matter of the complaint falls within
              the scope and ambit of the above investigation and that a
              separate investigation by the Committee would traverse the
              same issues. Therefore a parallel investigation, at this
              point, into these matters is not desirable.


              Accordingly, the Committee in respect of the above two
              matters, recommends that Parliament should await the report of
              the joint investigating team, the Committee should consider
              the report in order to proceed with the complaint.


              The Committee voted twenty-two in favour of the majority view
              with seven against.


     The report is tabled for consideration by the National Assembly.

2.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs on the
     Privileges and Immunities of International Atomic Energy Agency
     Agreement, dated 13 June 2001:


         The Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs, having considered the
         request for approval by Parliament of the Agreement on the
         Privileges and Immunities of the International Atomic Energy
         Agency, referred to it, and having conferred with the Portfolio
         Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development, recommends
         that the House, in terms of section 231(2) of the Constitution,
         approve accession to the said Agreement, with the following
         reservations:
         (a) The Government of the Republic of South Africa does not
              consider itself bound by the provisions of Section 6 of
              Article III, as certain limitations exist in the Republic
              regarding the holding of and trading in gold.


              Explanatory note: The buying, selling and holding of gold in
              the Republic is regulated. In terms of Exchange Control
              Regulation 2, no person other than an Authorised Dealer may
              buy or borrow any gold from or sell to any person who is not
              an Authorised Dealer, unless exemption from Exchange Control
              Regulation 5 has been authorised (Mining Houses and Mining
              Producers may elect to sell their total gold holdings to the
              approved counter parties, including foreign counter parties,
              provided that the Exchange Control Department of the South
              African Reserve Bank has given the necessary exemption from
              the aforementioned regulation).


         (b) The Government of the Republic does not undertake to apply the
              exemption from taxation in respect of salaries and emoluments,
              referred to in section 18(a)(ii) of Article VI of the
              Agreement, in respect of any South African citizen who is
              ordinarily resident in South Africa.


         (c) Pending a decision by the Government of the Republic on the
              compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice,
              the Government of the Republic does not consider itself bound
              by the terms of Section 34 of the Convention, which provides
              for the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of
              Justice in differences arising from the interpretation or
              application of the Convention.


     Report to be considered.

3.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs on the UN
     Privileges and Immunities Convention, dated 13 June 2001:


         The Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs, having considered the
         request for approval by Parliament of the Convention on the
         Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, adopted by the
         General Assembly of the United Nations on 13 February 1946,
         referred to it, and having conferred with the Portfolio Committee
         on Justice and Constitutional Development, recommends that the
         House, in terms of section 231(2) of the Constitution, approve
         accession to the said Convention, with the following reservations:


         (a) The Government of the Republic of South Africa does not
              consider itself bound by the provisions of Section 5 of
              Article II, as certain limitations exist in the Republic
              regarding the holding of and trading in gold.


              Explanatory note: The buying, selling and holding of gold in
              the Republic is regulated. In terms of Exchange Control
              Regulation 2, no person other than an Authorised Dealer may
              buy or borrow any gold from, or sell to, any person who is not
              an Authorised Dealer, unless exemption from Exchange Control
              Regulation 5 has been authorised (Mining Houses and Mining
              Producers may elect to sell their total gold holdings to the
              approved counter-parties, including foreign counter-parties,
              provided that the Exchange Control Department of the South
              African Reserve Bank has given the necessary exemption from
              the aforementioned regulation).


          (b) Pending a decision by the Government of the Republic of South
              Africa on the compulsory jurisdiction of the International
              Court of Justice, the Government of the Republic does not
              consider itself bound by the terms of Section 30 of the
              Convention, which provides for the compulsory jurisdiction of
              the International Court of Justice in differences arising from
              the interpretation or application of the Convention.


     Report to be considered.

4.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs on the
     Specialised Agencies' Privileges and Immunities Convention, dated 13
     June 2001:
         The Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs, having considered the
         request for approval by Parliament of the Convention on the
         Privileges and Immunities of the Specialised Agencies, approved by
         the General Assembly of the United Nations on 21 November 1947,
         referred to it, and having conferred with the Portfolio Committee
         on Justice and Constitutional Development, recommends that the
         House, in terms of section 231(2) of the Constitution, approve
         accession to the said Convention, with the following reservations:


         (a) The Government of the Republic of South Africa, in accordance
              with the provisions of Section 43 of Article XI, indicates the
              following specialised agencies in respect of which it
              undertakes to apply the provisions of the Convention:


              1.  The International Labour Organisation (ILO).

7.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Social Development on Study Tour
     to Brazil, dated 9 May 2001:


     The Portfolio Committee on Social Development reports as follows:


     A.  Preamble


         A delegation of the Committee undertook a study tour to Brazil
         from 18 to 24 March 2001. This multiparty delegation was led by
         the Chairperson of the Committee, Mr E Saloojee (ANC), and he was
         accompanied by Mr M Masuta (ANC), Mr A van Jaarsveld (NNP), Ms P
         Cupido (DP), Ms I Mars (IFP), Ms Z Adhikari (Committee Secretary)
         and Ms N Ahmed (Parliamentary Researcher).


     B.  Introduction


         The purpose of the study tour was to investigate Brazil's
         management systems with regard to social, economic and human
         development within the new sectoral paradigm of Social
         Development. Brazil's welfare project has been operating within
         the paradigm of Social Development for a number of years, and it
         was felt that the Committee could benefit from the insights,
         successes, failures, policies, programmes and models for delivery
         that Brazil has effected within this paradigm.


     C.  Objectives


         1.  To review the nature and extent of social security benefits in
              Brazil.


         2.  To critically assess its anti-poverty programmes.


         3.  To investigate the community/government partnership model
              operative in the area of social service delivery.


         4.  To assess the nature and extent of household food security
              programmes.


         5.  To review programmes for children living on the street and
              young people at risk.


         The magnitude of the transformation of social and sustainable
         human development in South Africa necessitates that the
         Committee's involvement in these areas be active and incisive.
         Furthermore, the Cabinet appointed a committee of enquiry into a
         comprehensive social security system for South Africa, and that
         committee is finalising its report. The Portfolio Committee wanted
         to make recommendations in this regard, based on the findings from
         the study tour.


         The delegation travelled to three cities, Brasilia, Sao Paulo and
         Rio De Janeiro, and meetings had been strategically selected to
         ensure that the objectives of the study were met, and that
         meaningful input could be made into the final report of the said
         committee of enquiry. It was also deemed important to identify,
         through this study tour, key challenges to be addressed by the
         Social Development sector as it operationalises its policies
         within its new conceptual paradigm.


         The tour included meetings with delegations comprising political
         office-bearers, senior government officials, project managers, non-
         governmental organisations (NGOs), community-based organisations
         (CBOs), community leaders, beneficiaries of government-initiated
         programmes and members of civil society involved in community
         action for social transformation. The delegation also visited four
         sites. The site visits were included to ensure that the delegation
         could focus on the implementation of programmes, rather than
         merely being a passive audience to presentations on policy
         initiatives.


         One visit was to a peri-urban community project dealing with
         social security and youth at risk. The second site visit was to a
         low-cost housing project that formed part of a broader strategy of
         urban renewal and development in Brazil. The third visit was to
         the Favelas - the informal settlements in Rio De Janeiro - where
         communities are themselves acting as agents for social change. The
         fourth site visit was an experiential exercise whereby delegation
         members enacted the process of executing social transfers for food
         security. This forms an integral part of the Brazilian social
         security system. In the area of food security, Brazil has focused
         on non-income social transfers to alleviate poverty and to target
         social assistance to vulnerable groups, including the unemployed,
         women, children and the aged.


         This Report covers meetings with delegations and site visits in
         chronological order. Emphasis is placed on the insights gained
         during the tour, on key recommendations as well as on challenges
         for the social development sector in executing its mandate of
         poverty alleviation through social security and the development of
         equitable investment in human resource capacity. More detailed
         programmatic information is available from the Committee
         Secretary, upon request.


     D.  Meetings and site visits


         1.  Briefing by SA Ambassador to Brazil


              Upon arrival in Brazil, the delegation was briefed by our
              Ambassador, Mr Rakwena. He provided deep insight and gave an
              astute account of the social, economic and political factors
              operative in the Brazilian society. Furthermore, he gave an
              account of the socio-economic relationship and mutual
              interests that infuse the Brazilian/South African connection.
              He spoke at length about the social development project in
              Brazil, and was able to provide the delegation with an
              unbiased and objective account of the country's social
              realities.


              The magnanimity of Mr and Mrs Rakwena's hospitality, the
              assistance from the First Secretary, Ms B Henry, and the
              unqualified administrative support from the Embassy staff, are
              noted with gratitude.


         2.  Mission Child (Brasilia)


              This is a privately funded NGO whose aim is to eradicate
              poverty, hunger and social exclusion through investing
              available resources in education. The concept of social
              exclusion in Brazil is defined as referring to those who live
              below the poverty line and who have poor access to social,
              educational, health and economic resources. An integrated and
              holistic model of intervention with the individual child,
              family, school and community is practiced. In view of the very
              high incidence of child labour in Brazil, its social and
              political movements have identified the eradication of child
              labour as the central focus of development activities. It is
              estimated that more than two million children are involved in
              some form of child labour in Brazil.


              This NGO thus offers poor families a basic income as an
              incentive for their children to remain in school. This
              integrated programme, through the provision of a basic income,
              aims to eradicate the sense of indebtedness that poor families
              may feel as recipients of welfare benefits, as well as through
              education, to restore for poor families a sense of citizenship
              and pride in being participating members of their society. It
              is the aim of this organisation to infuse within Brazilian
              society a "Mania for Education", starting from the very young
              to the very old. It is their belief that through education,
              people are not only equipped with skills, but can reclaim
              their dignity as citizens.


              Mission Child offers a Bolsa Escola or school bursary to poor
              households or families where the incidence of illiteracy, lack
              of skills and poor family cohesion may be very high. In order
              to qualify, families must have a monthly income of not more
              than half the minimum wage (the minimum wage in Brazil is
              US$80). Poor families are identified by the local school, and
              school staff monitor the school attendance of the child.


              CBOs and NGOs regularly visit these families and offer support
              services where needed. Administrators from the municipality
              are also closely involved with the programme. This close
              collaboration at local level easily facilitates monitoring
              compliance of families.


              School bursaries to families are discontinued if parents do
              not comply with the conditions of this bursary. Through this
              type of social assistance intervention, the school drop-out
              rate was reduced from 18% to 0,4% in the city of Brasilia.


              The benefits of this programme include the following:


              (a) It targets the problem of poverty alleviation
                  holistically.


              (b) It invests in citizenship.


              (c) It builds self-esteem in poor children and their families.


              (d) It brings immediate and tangible results, as services are
                  direct.


              (e) It is not dependent on government funding.


              (f) It is easy to replicate and tailored to country/locality-
                  specific circumstances. In Mexico for example, in
                  addition to school attendance, children need to be
                  immunised. In other instances where this programme has
                  been replicated, girls get more money than boys, to
                  encourage girls to attend school.


              (g) Administrative costs are minimal, as institutional
                  mechanisms that already operate in the lives of children
                  and families, are utilised.


              (h) Delivery at municipal level ensures monitoring and
                  effective targeting of families in need.


         3.  Comments and recommendations
              (a) We need to define the role of NGOs in South Africa in
                  providing social security.


              (b) It is necessary to develop enabling legislation, should a
                  role be defined for the NGO sector in administering
                  social security.


              (c) There is the challenge of fostering closer partnerships
                  between the private sector and NGOs in social service
                  delivery.


              (d) There should be strong local government-led service
                  delivery in the area of social development.


              (e) We need to establish a standard household minimum wage as
                  a mechanism for targeting social security.


              (f) Consider a basic income grant for families to promote self-
                  sufficiency. This could be linked to the attainment of
                  some form of skills development or other form of social
                  competence.


              (g) Develop an accurate statistical child poverty profile in
                  South Africa as an entry point for poverty alleviation.
                  Targeted interventions can then be developed and
                  monitored.


              (h) A clear and unambiguous poverty line must be agreed upon
                  to identify the level and depth of poverty in South
                  Africa. Social assistance targeting can thus be
                  facilitated, and the cost of alleviating poverty can be
                  determined.


              (i) There must be a strategic focus in all social development
                  programmes on developing a sense of community and full
                  citizenship through activities and programmes that
                  promote the attainment of socio-economic and other human
                  rights.


         4.  Communidade Solidaria (Brasilia)
              Mrs Ruth Cardosa, wife of the Brazilian President, heads the
              Board of this organisation. It is modelled on a true
              partnership between existing government departments, the
              private sector, non-profit (NPOs) and profit organisations.
              When the new administration came into power in 1995, one of
              the identified priorities was a complete and thorough review
              of social programmes in view of the high income inequality in
              Brazil.


              As a result of this review, a number of problems were
              identified:


              (a) The government alone could not address all the social
                  problems prevalent in the society.


              (b) Legislation governing social development sector
                  partnerships and funding parameters was outdated.


              (c) There was a need to strengthen NPOs and the community
                  sectors.


              (d) There was a need to initiate a new partnership between the
                  private and NPO sectors.


              New legislation was then developed for the third sector (not
              government and not business). Up until that time, the third
              sector was relatively unco-ordinated, and there was a need to
              create links in this sector. An electronic third sector
              network was created, and all organisations that wanted to
              participate in this network, could be included. This has
              proved to be very useful, as collaboration was greatly
              facilitated. Volunteerism was also actively encouraged, and 34
              volunteer centres were opened in all the large cities in
              Brazil.


              The Council of Communidade Solidaria comprises a
              representative from the President's office, the Ministers of
              Health, Education and Labour, as well as 21 representatives of
              civil society.


              Communidade Solidaria is active in a number of programmes:
              Youth programmes, University Solidaria, Solidarity in
              Literacy, Handicrafts for women.


              This organisation's methodology is to create model projects
              that can then be easily replicated. The first project was a
              vocational training project for out-of-school youths. A
              monetary incentive of half a minimum wage was paid to them in
              respect of a scholarship, as an incentive to participate in
              the programme. Youths then participate in vocational training
              for six months. The business sector, NGOs, and to a degree the
              Department of Labour, fund this project. The organisation
              started with 1 000 youths, and after five years 100 000 youths
              had benefitted from this project. The organisation also funded
              special training programmes for NGOs working with youths. NGOs
              can then develop programmes based on the model projects.


              In respect of the university programme, local universities are
              invited to select senior students to participate in community
              work. Students get paid a small stipend by the organisation,
              to cover travelling costs, but have to largely fund
              themselves. Students are then sent to work in the North-east
              of Brazil, the country's poorest region. They work within
              communities where needs have been identified. They provide
              services in respect of day-care centres, community centres,
              homes for the aged, youth discussions around sexually
              transmitted diseases and sexuality, sanitation and clean
              water, and waste management. Though this kind of community
              service does not get formal accreditation from the university,
              the programme is proving to be so popular that University
              Solidaria could not cope with the demands from students to do
              community service.


              On Solidaria with a view to reducing illiteracy, this
              programme targets young people between the ages of 15 and 19
              years. The duration is six months, and teachers from local
              schools, colleges and universities offer their services to
              this programme. This initiative is funded partly by the
              Department of Education and partly by private businesses.


              The handicraft project seeks not only to teach women
              entrepreneurial skills, but also to preserve the rich craft
              legacy in the country. Women crafters are assisted throughout
              this programme by qualified designers to produce crafts that
              are suitable for export. These designers scout the latest
              fashion trends locally and internationally and thus enable the
              crafters to produce goods that are sought after. The programme
              also then assists them with marketing these goods, not only as
              novelties, but as functional items sought after in the
              commercial market.


         5.  Comments and recommendations


              (a) The Department of Social Development can lead the
                  mobilisation of the NGO sector in this country. To date,
                  its role has largely been one of funder, but the
                  Department could make expertise available to assist NGOs
                  with training, programme planning and evaluation and
                  project management. It could also act as a facilitator to
                  create areas for linkages and collaboration.


              (b) The area of volunteerism in the social sectors is still
                  relatively underdeveloped. This has huge human resource
                  potential that can be tapped in services to communities.
                  With the year 2001 being declared the Year of the
                  Volunteer by the UN, it is an opportune time to develop
                  this.


              (c) The Department of Social Development has made great
                  strides in establishing the Advisory Board on Social
                  Development. In order to further consolidate a
                  partnership with the NGO and business sectors, extensive
                  civil society representation in partnership with
                  government initiatives can foster closer working
                  relationships that will ultimately benefit communities.


              (d) Universities in South Africa do prescribe community
                  service for some students. For those students who do not
                  study in particular faculties, there may be few
                  opportunities to engage in community service.
                  Universities in South Africa may undertake to do formal
                  accreditation of community service as a way to encourage
                  students. Schools could also adopt this programme.


         6.  Secretariat for Social Assistance (Brasilia)


              The aim of the Secretariat is not only to fight poverty, but
              also to address the high level of income inequality in Brazil.
              Brazil's level of income inequality is comparable to Malawi
              and South Africa. Furthermore, it is estimated that out of a
              total population of 170 million people, 13 million live below
              the poverty line. The poor are identified using the Human
              Development Index. Fragile members from poor communities,
              namely children, the elderly and people with disabilities, are
              targeted for intervention, and the programme currently reaches
              seven million people. Brazil's National Social Development
              Policy focuses primarily on the family.


              The Secretariat provides pre-school education for children up
              to-six years old. For the age group seven to fourteen, the aim
              of the programmes is to eradicate child labour by ensuring
              that the child remains at school. Provisions are also made for
              after-school programmes for children. Families are paid a
              basic income as an incentive to keep children at school.
              Children must have at least 75% attendance at both school and
              after-school activities. To date 396 000 children from 90
              municipalities in the country have benefitted from this
              programme.


              For youths, the Secretariat provides an extensive programme,
              entitled Youth Agents for Social Change. Youths who have
              dropped out of school are targeted for intervention. Many of
              them have already committed petty crimes and are thus at risk.
              They have to participate in social and therapeutic programmes.
              In addition to being recipients of services, they have to
              become involved in their local communities as agents for
              social change. While there is no pre-condition that they must
              attend school, they have to be committed to the programme. 38
              000 youths have benefitted from this programme.


              The Secretariat monitors these programmes carefully to assess
              the micro-impact of social interventions on families. An
              initial evaluation tool is used in families and impact is
              assessed after two years.


              Service delivery is highly decentralised, as the Brazilian
              Constitution has ensured that municipalities play a definitive
              role in the delivery of social services and programmes. Thus
              implementation of programmes has been decentralised to local
              municipality level. Local municipal councils transfer
              resources from national level to local municipalities for
              delivery and utilisation.
              Each social action agenda for communities must be established
              at local level. Furthermore, the social indicators that are to
              be addressed, coupled with an implementation, are developed.
              In this way needs are identified for prioritisation and
              implementation at local level. A cluster approach among the
              sectors of social assistance, education, health, environment
              and housing ensures an intersectoral approach to problem
              solving. The federal level is actively fostering the
              development of NGOs, particularly in smaller and rural
              municipalities where no NGOs currently exist.


              The delegation then visited a Youth for Social Change Project
              and engaged with youths who proved to be very articulate and
              displayed high levels of social competence. In this programme,
              youths are recipients of a therapeutic programme that involves
              psychological and peer counselling, creative therapy and
              social skills development. Part of their community service for
              social change is to assist in the administration of social
              security benefits for elderly beneficiaries. The youths
              expressed many positive sentiments about the way in which the
              programme has enhanced their sense of self-esteem and self-
              worth.


         7.  Comments and recommendations


              (a) The role of local government as the most appropriate
                  instrument for social service delivery needs to be
                  developed. South Africa has a rich history of community
                  mobilisation for social change. The community networks
                  need to be revitalised, and they can, in partnership with
                  municipalities, identify and address needs at local
                  level. Strong community involvement in change activities
                  can foster broader social development, particularly in
                  communities ravaged by crime and other social problems.
                  Ownership of programmes and initiatives can thus be
                  facilitated.


              (b) Close intersectoral involvement among social sector
                  partners at local level will facilitate the
                  identification of areas for closer collaboration, and
                  will eradicate duplication of services.


              (c) The role of national departments in fostering civil
                  society participation can be explored. In the event of
                  direct service delivery being decentralised, national
                  departments can play a facilitative role in this regard.
                  National departments' monitoring and evaluation role in
                  respect of the social impact of programmes can then also
                  be more defined and actively implemented.


              (d) Beneficiaries of services becoming agents for social
                  change is a philosophy worth exploring in this country.
                  Many beneficiaries may lack self-worth if they consider
                  themselves recipients of services. These feelings may be
                  addressed if they could become active participants in
                  programmes that seek to develop other facets of community
                  life.


         8.  Briefing with project managers (Brasilia)


              The delegation met with project managers facilitating
              programmes targeting families, people with disabilities,
              children who have suffered sexual abuse, literacy programmes,
              youth programmes and early childhood education programmes.
              This was essentially a briefing session designed to inform the
              delegation about the activities involved in each of these
              programmes. Many similarities with South African initiatives
              in this regard were identified.


              The delegation noted with some concern that project managers
              were quite uncomfortable discussing issues of HIV and AIDS,
              and they were left wondering whether this does not form an
              important educative component within these programmes.


         9.  Secretariat for Housing, Sanitation and Urban Transportation
              (Brasilia)


              The Brazilian government provides the land and communities
              take charge of building houses. Housing development in urban
              areas is considered part of the social development initiatives
              within the city. This is a federal-led initiative and
              comprises varied forms of state subsidisation. In respect of
              gender equity, new legislation provides that female-headed
              households get preference when it comes to housing.
              Furthermore, women are also prioritised as title-holders for
              land. The old administration used to fund the builders, but
              now funds are going directly to the people themselves, who
              take charge of building their own homes.


              The delegation then visited a housing project. This low-cost
              housing is intended for those families who do have an income
              and are eligible to receive a state subsidy.


         10. Meeting with Senator Suplici (Brasilia)


              This Senator is leading the initiative for the introduction of
              a basic income grant in Brazil. The initiative is premised on
              the condition that every Brazilian must unconditionally have
              the right to a basic income grant. The aim is to ensure that
              everyone has the right to participate in the wealth of the
              nation. It is his understanding that the current federal
              government system of social assistance is too modest and
              cannot successfully free poor families from poverty. Currently
              in Brazil, families qualify for social assistance if their
              income is half the minimum wage and they have children under
              the age of 14 years. The social assistance varies depending on
              the number of children per family: For a family with one
              child, it is 15 Reais (1US$ = 2 Reais); for two children it is
              30 Reais; and for three or more children, it is 45 Reais.


              The Senator has proposed a social assistance system whereby
              the basic income grant must be guaranteed to complement the
              per capita income of a person with an income of less than half
              the minimum wage. Poor families will benefit in this way, as
              individuals within large or extended families can
              substantially augment the household income. A costing exercise
              has revealed that paying every individual a basic income will
              be roughly equivalent to the amount Brazil is paying in
              foreign debt. The idea is that the basic income grant will
              ensure that monies spent will be in the primary interest of
              the Brazilian people.


              The Senator has enjoyed wide support in Brazil for his
              proposal, but sustained advocacy work is needed for the
              proposal to be formally adopted.


         11. Comments and recommendations


              (a) It is likely that the Committee of Enquiry into a
                  Comprehensive Social Security System is considering the
                  proposal of a basic income grant. It is important that a
                  thorough costing exercise be conducted to determine the
                  cost of such an initiative, as well as its potential for
                  sustainability. A costing exercise must include not only
                  the payment cost of a basic income grant, but also the
                  administrative costs that will be incurred. Given the
                  current lack of capacity in the administration of social
                  security, including administrative costs in this exercise
                  is of vital importance.


              (b) The interface with other forms of social assistance needs
                  to be investigated if a basic income grant is considered.


              (c) It may be necessary to institute legislative reform in the
                  area of social assistance, should a basic income grant or
                  other forms of comprehensive social security be
                  considered.


              (d) It will be necessary to explore different financing
                  mechanisms, should a basic income grant be considered.
                  The method of financing needs to be sustainable. Some
                  suggestions have included an increase in VAT, and various
                  forms of taxation from middle and upper income earners.


              (e) In Alaska, where the basic income grant is operative, a
                  referendum was held on this issue. People's support can
                  be gauged as well as proposals for taxation of middle and
                  higher income earners can be highlighted. This route may
                  be worthwhile considering.


              (f) The Committee of Enquiry may benefit from contact with the
                  Basic Income European Network, which is active in
                  advocating that countries adopt the idea of a basic
                  income grant as a primary method of alleviating poverty.


              (g) Senator Suplici also indicated a complete willingness to
                  engage with the Committee of Enquiry in respect of his
                  technical expertise. That committee may benefit from
                  interactions with him.


         12. Visit to Favelas (Rio De Janeiro)


              The delegation met with community leaders and activists
              working towards the social and economic improvement of the
              slum areas in Rio. Community leaders are the focal people in
              contact with government officials in the areas of housing,
              electrification, sanitation and the provision of water to
              homes in the area. Government officials are briefed on the
              needs of the community and they then contract the necessary
              people to develop basic services and infrastructure. Community
              leaders take responsibility for ensuring active community
              participation and payment of municipal services.


              This model is working very well, as a walkabout by the
              delegation through the area highlighted the numerous and
              significant improvements that have been effected in the living
              conditions of people. Local labourers and artisans from the
              community are employed in building, construction, waste
              disposal and other manual activities, and in this way
              employment opportunities are created for the previously
              unemployed. Community members also feel greater ownership in
              the improvements that are being effected, as was evident from
              the maintenance activities in which local people were
              involved.


              The delegation then visited a day-care centre in the area that
              operates on a 24-hour basis to accommodate those people who
              work night shift. The day-care centre is privately funded,
              mostly from businesses whose employees leave their children
              there. The children appeared very content and well cared for,
              and they seemed to enjoy a very relaxed and contained
              environment.


         13. ACCOR Brasil (Sao Paulo)


              This company offers 19 products/brands in two large sectors,
              namely the hotel and service industries, the latter mainly in
              the food and restaurant business. In the year 2000, ACCOR
              issued 500 000 000 vouchers, 5 000 000 food baskets were
              distributed, 120 000 000 meals were served and there were
              12 000 000 users of their services, including ACCOR
              restaurants in airports and bus terminals. ACCOR has developed
              the ticket system as a form of social assistance and currently
              have 5 000 000 daily users, 200 000 suppliers and affiliated
              establishments, 60 000 corporate customers and 23 000
              employees.


              The worker food benefit programme has been operating in Brazil
              since 1977. The main goal of this programme is to contribute
              to the improvement of workers' nutritional status, with the
              aim of improving productivity, preventing occupational
              diseases and increasing their quality of life.


              In respect of ACCOR's food voucher services, this programme is
              operative in 31 countries on three continents. The food
              voucher scheme ensures that users can only purchase food with
              their vouchers/cards. The purchase of alcohol and cigarettes
              is not included.


              (a) Operation of food voucher service scheme


                  *   ACCOR produces and delivers the vouchers ordered by
                       an employer/company.


                  *   The company gives the vouchers to its employees.


                  *   Employees use their vouchers to have lunch at the
                       cafeteria or to purchase food from a
                       supermarket/shop.


                  *   ACCOR reimburses the affiliated establishment for the
                       vouchers.


              (b) Benefits of food voucher programme


                  *   It enables an employee and his/her family to buy
                       basic food products from a wide network of outlets.


                  *   The vouchers are not subject to employers' social
                       charges and employee income tax.


              An innovation in the Brazilian food voucher scheme has been
              the introduction of a smart card as an alternative to the
              paper voucher system. This Smart Card uses available
              technology to reduce costs and to increase the quality, safety
              and efficacy of the system. The advantages to the employers
              include no distribution to employees, no insurance, no loss
              due to theft, better control and less fraud as cards can only
              be used by the cardholder (there is a password), employers and
              employees can block cards at any time.


              Other advantages include savings as purchases of any amount
              can be effected, as well as savings made by buying products on
              sale/special at any shop or supermarket. In the event that the
              user loses the card or it is stolen, the user does not lose
              the benefit if customer service is called and the card is
              blocked. Administrative costs are substantially reduced, as
              there are no monthly procedures to receive the benefit, nor
              special procedures to be able to use the card.


              A pharmacy card has also been introduced, specially designed
              for those companies that want to allow their employees to use
              part of their monthly income to pay for medicines.


              Members of the delegation were each given a smart card and
              allowed to purchase a product in a supermarket. In this way
              the delegation could experience the transaction and see the
              way in which the system operates in practice.


         14. Comments and recommendations


              (a) The Committee of Enquiry could investigate a broader
                  application of the food voucher/smart card system in this
                  country. Its application in providing household food
                  security to the poor is a successful method of ensuring
                  that vulnerable members of households benefit directly
                  from social assistance.


              (b) To date, the main form of social security has been income
                  transfers. Targeting poor families to benefit from food
                  transfers can contribute significantly to improved health
                  and enhanced learning capacity of children.


     E.  Challenges that emerged during tour


         1.  Committee of Enquiry into Comprehensive Social Security System


              There is a need to reconsider whether the ultimate aim of
              social security in South Africa is essentially poverty
              alleviation/eradication. The Committee may want to consider to
              what extent a new comprehensive social security system will
              address deepening income inequality in this country.


         2.  Social development sector


              This new paradigm aims to build human capacity through
              fostering self-sufficiency in individuals, families and
              communities. One of the primary aims within this sector to
              date has been poverty alleviation. The main challenge to the
              social development sector and its sectoral partners is to
              conceptualise and devise strategies that address income
