   STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ON S0UTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT'S
          RESPONSE TO TERRORIST ATTACK ON UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr D J SITHOLE: Madam Speaker, the  objective  of  terrorism  is  to  spread
fear, to demoralise and to get nations to succumb to this.

Terrorism, as seen on 11 September 2001 in New York and Washington,  is  the
worst crime committed against  the  innocent.  Terrorism  knows  no  colour,
gender or religion. It has neither brother nor sister. Neither does it  have
a relative. It transcends national borders and strikes anything in its way.

The  killing  of  innocent  people  cannot  be  justified  in   any   manner
whatsoever. Religious fundamentalism or fundamentalism of  any  sort  should
not be allowed to instil fear in people of the world. We must unite and  rid
ourselves of such tendencies and practices,  and  teach  our  offspring  the
value of protecting life.

The ANC,  in  its  history,  has  always  condemned  and  struggled  against
terrorism. It never sought shelter under it,  even  at  the  time  when  the
apartheid dogs of war were unleashed against  our  people.  The  killing  of
civilians and innocent  people  cannot  be  an  act  of  bravery.  It  is  a
reflection of cowardice at its worst.

It  is  important  for  us  to  learn  that  when  we  refuse  people  their
fundamental  human  rights  to  express  themselves,  this  will   lead   to
desperation. As governments of the world, we need  to  ensure  that  in  our
pronouncements and actions we do not create breeding grounds for  terrorism.
We need to ask ourselves: What is it that we have  done  or  said  that  has
created breeding grounds for terrorism? Let us look at our actions.  Let  us
accept that we have made mistakes in the past and, in some instances,  wrong
decisions.  Together,  let  us  find  a  lasting  solution  to  the  world's
problems.

The South African Government  and  this  Parliament,  led  by  our  glorious
movement, the ANC, condemns what befell the American people. The  people  of
this country stand united against  terrorism.  We  will  support  the  fight
against terrorism, and we will actively participate in defeating it.

But we will not sit back  when  the  world  is  led  to  war  by  anger  and
political expediency. Our Government and our  people  have  demonstrated  in
their public pronouncements  that  they  will  not  support  a  war  against
innocent people who will become victims, like those in  the  crashed  planes
at the World Trade Centre, the Pentagon and  Pennsylvania.  We  in  the  ANC
have always believed  and  held  the  conviction  that  violence  cannot  be
resolved with violence.

We join our Government in calling on those who have  found  comfort  in  the
vocabulary of war to take a minute and think whether they  are  not  playing
into  the  game  plan  of  these  terrorists.  The  approach  of  collective
punishment as espoused in the Middle East by the Israeli Government  against
the Palestinian people is wrong. This phenomenon is not different  from  the
total onslaught of the apartheid regime.

As South Africans, particularly those who did not  benefit  from  apartheid,
we know and understand the pain of being segregated on the  basis  of  one's
skin colour, one's political and  one's  religious  beliefs.  The  apartheid
government developed what they called the ``common purpose'' doctrine.  This
was meant to make anyone equally guilty as  perpetrators  of  crime.  People
were sentenced to death as a result. We cannot allow ourselves  to  go  back
to such barbaric practices of the past.

Peace-loving people of the world must urge their leaders and governments  to
resist the temptation to unleash their military power on  the  innocent.  We
come from the World Conference on Racism, Racial Discrimination,  Xenophobia
and Related Intolerances. This conference was meant to  teach  and  make  us
understand the pain of being hated by one's fellow human beings.

 One important thing the tragedy in the  United  States  has  brought  about
itself is the unity of the American people and the world. I  am  aware  that
South  Africans  have  a  long  way  to  go  in  that   respect.   What   is
internationalism? What is patriotism? How should one be patriotic  to  one's
fellow people? This issue was once discussed in this House, but I am  afraid
that some people did not learn anything from that debate. They  treated  the
debate with contempt and closed their eyes and their ears to it.

It is wrong to play cheap politics with the tragedy that  has  befallen  the
American people. It is inconsiderate for those who  see  an  opportunity  to
score points through the mayhem. It  is  unacceptable  and  insensitive  for
opposition leaders to use this situation to feed their egos. It  is  inhuman
to play to the press gallery to advance narrow political  interests  at  the
expense of the victims and families who suffered in this situation.

It cannot be right to kill people the way  those  who  hijacked  the  planes
did. We cannot for one minute support their cause. South  Africans  must  be
able to tell what is right from what  is  wrong.  We  cannot  support  their
actions. Terrorism in any form should not be used to  fight  one's  enemies.
All the decisions we  make  today  must  not  create  grounds  for  problems
tomorrow.

In our fight against terrorism we must not find ourselves using  tactics  of
terror in an effort to defeat it. We should  have  one  point  of  reference
when we define terrorism. The support for Savimbi in  Angola  is  terrorism.
The war against terrorism should also include the protection  of  the  poor,
women, children and the weak in the Middle East.

We all agree that an attack on one member of the community of nations is  an
attack on all of us. The poor people of Angola and those who  are  subjected
to collective punishment  by  those  who  are  militarily  and  economically
stronger than them should see this commitment  to  fight  terrorism  in  the
world as a sign of relief from their pains and the dawn  of  a  new  day  of
peace, security and prosperity.

The ANC expresses its sympathy and condolences  to  the  victims  and  their
families and to the people and Government of the United States. We  say,  in
this hour of pain and sorrow we are  with  them  and  we  are  committed  to
joining hands in the fight against terrorism. [Applause.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, first a word of thanks  to  the
New NP and the FA for their time in  this  debate,  and  I  speak  on  their
behalf as well.

I was a little shocked by Mr Sithole's speech because it  was  shot  through
with ambiguities and the normal double talk  which,  unfortunately,  is  the
last thing that this country or this Parliament or this world needs to  hear
at a time  like  this.  [Interjections.]  Perhaps  the  Deputy  Minister  of
Foreign Affairs will clarify exactly  what  the  Government's  position  and
standpoint is without trying to walk on both sides  of  the  street  at  the
same time.

South Africans understand what it means to live in fear of random  violence.
In this very city we have known terror -  unexpected,  undiscriminating  and
unmerciful. We remember Nolusindisa Lolo, the young mother who died  when  a
bomb was placed under her  vendor's  table  at  the  Bellville  magistrates'
court. We remember a schoolgirl, Olivia Milner, whose lower  leg  was  blown
off in a pizza restaurant in Camps  Bay.  We  remember  Ebrahim  Moosa,  the
professor who left the country after a pipe  bomb  had  ripped  through  his
home while he was watching television with his children.

But the events of 11 September in New York,  Pittsburgh  and  Washington  DC
are of a different order entirely. [Interjections.] If  I  was  in  the  ANC
after  the  events  of  this  morning,  I  would  keep  very  quiet  indeed.
[Interjections.] The events of 11 September have  shocked  the  whole  world
and they have changed  it,  and  our  place  and  purpose  in  it,  probably
forever. We have seen dramatic images of the devastation of the World  Trade
Centre and the Pentagon, and the Pennsylvania crash site.

But there are aspects of terrorism that one has to experience to  comprehend
- the sounds of sirens congregating, the  smell  of  smoke  and  death,  the
flinching at loud noises  for  a  long  time  afterward.  These  are  shared
memories giving us here a very small window on the anguish  and  outrage  of
the American people. That is why South  Africa  must  rally  to  the  global
coalition against terrorism. We must play our part  to  fulfil  the  promise
from President Bush's speech:


  Whether the terrorists are brought to justice or justice  is  brought  to
  the terrorists, justice will prevail.

But I think we should ask ourselves what it means to be at war with  terror.
It is a fight against a perverted ideology, an ideology which has no  regard
for human life, not even the lives of its own adherents. It purports to  act
on behalf of faith but in reality it is the anathema and antithesis  of  all
faiths. It is an enemy which is everywhere and an enemy which is nowhere.

Therefore, we need to use every weapon, military, diplomatic,  economic  and
political, to cut out this terrorism and its causes, to stifle its  support,
to target its  funding  and  to  remove  its  lethal  machinery.  It  is  an
unfortunate reality that one cannot get peace without fighting  for  it.  We
must blow apart the calculus of terrorism, which is that the will  to  fight
is weak in modern democracies. This, in fact, is a  time  for  strength.  In
the words of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan:


  Out of evil can come good. Paradoxically, these vicious assaults  on  our
  common humanity have had the effect of reaffirming our  common  humanity.
  This was an attack on humanity, and humanity must respond to it as one.

One good thing has emerged from this  evil  of  11  September.  There  is  a
tentative - obviously it is too early to tell - global consensus.  Countries
such as China and Iran appear today to stand on the side of justice.

To hold this fragile new bond together, the United Nations must  provide  an
umbrella of political legitimacy to the campaign  against  terror.  That  is
not to say that military operations, where they  are  necessary,  should  be
subject to a running veto before the UN Security Council on every issue.

The United  States  is  entitled  to  pursue  and  apprehend  the  correctly
identified perpetrators of attacks on American soil. They  are  entitled  to
attack those states that continue to provide safe havens to  terrorists,  on
condition that they avoid gratuitously targeting civilians.

This is phase one of this campaign, where we are unlikely to  be  asked  for
military assistance - and frankly, we would be hard-pressed to  provide  it.
We  must,  of  course,  offer  and  deliver  the  full   services   of   our
intelligence, police and banking institutions in this phase.

Phase two of the war against terrorism involves a global commitment to  seek
and destroy all terrorist cells and networks in  every  country  and  remove
them from the face of the earth. If the  world  pulls  together,  terrorists
will have no place to hide. In these circumstances,  if  South  Africa  were
asked to engage militarily to combat terrorism, we should be prepared to  do
so under certain conditions, preferably under the aegis of the UN.

It is our view to see justice done on our own soil, in  our  region  and  on
our continent. This is our duty and primary function in the global  campaign
against terrorism. I am deeply indebted  to  distinguished  colleagues  like
Colin Eglin, Dr Boy Geldenhuys and others for  the  formulation  of  certain
proposals.

South  Africa  must  immediately  and  unreservedly  implement  UN  Security
Council Resolution 1373 passed last weekend.  Perhaps  the  Deputy  Minister
will affirm whether or not  we  are  planning  to  do  so.  This  resolution
requires member states  to  co-operate  in  a  wide  range  of  areas,  from
suppressing the financing of  terrorism  to  providing  early  warning,  co-
operating in criminal investigations and exchanging information on  possible
terrorist acts. I believe we need to get our act  together  fast  to  comply
with the 90-day deadline set by that resolution.

Secondly, Parliament should now sit late and longer to revamp  antiterrorism
legislation. It is  quite  unbelievable  that  in  the  midst  of  a  global
terrorism crisis, this Parliament sits and the tabling of  this  legislation
is not  even  in  sight.  Why  not?  We  must  toughen  up  further  on  our
extradition laws. South Africa should not be  a  safe  haven  for  terrorist
fugitives.

We must provide and improve witness protection programmes  and  bolster  our
intelligence capabilities. I also believe we should not be  squeamish  about
genuine antiterrorist measures. We should not use or  abuse  those  measures
as a sort of backdoor erosion of civil liberties. This is not the  time  for
cynical economic opportunism. I am dumbfounded by the ANC  majority  on  the
safety and security commission's misuse of the US terror attack  to  try  to
justify banning foreign ownership in the security  industry.  Where  is  the
sense of propriety and proportion?

I believe South Africa should take the lead within SADC  to  guarantee  that
Southern Africa becomes a terrorist-free zone. President Mbeki  should  work
within the African Union with like-minded leaders  such  as  President  Wade
and President Obassanjo, to form a  united  African  front  against  terror.
That commitment should be added explicitly and by necessary  implication  to
the New  Africa  Initiative,  including  Maps.  A  global  campaign  against
terrorism is not a threat to  Africa.  It  is  an  opportunity  to  mobilise
international forces to drive destabilising forces from  our  countries  and
from the face of our continent.

Terrorism has already hit Africa's  soft  flanks  -  massacres  in  Algeria,
Egypt and the Sudan; bombs in Kenya, Tanzania and even in the city  of  Cape
Town; and violence in Nigeria  -  somewhat  eclipsed  by  the  more  awesome
events of the World Trade Centre, it left 500 people dead the day after  the
collapse of the WTC.

This is a basis, even in a very dark time,  for  unity.  This  is  the  same
basis on which our President should use his chairmanship of  the  Nonaligned
Movement to draw member states into the global coalition. This is a  crucial
time that demands unflinching, unambiguous leadership. It is possible to  be
both aggressive and  just;  to  be  both  deliberate  and  decisive.  It  is
impossible to be both against terrorism on the one hand  and  for  communion
with  international  rogues  who  lead,   sponsor   or   support   terrorist
organisations on the other. [Interjections.]

It is time to stop letting men like  Muammar  Gaddafi  or  Gerry  Adams  rub
moral credibility off the shoulders of our  giants.  Talking  about  terror,
President Mugabe, our own northern neighbour, also practises what is  called
state-sponsored terror, which is a form of terrorism nonetheless. We do  not
rub shoulders with him and this is very simple. [Interjections.]

One man's terrorist, as Barbara Emile said, is  not  another  man's  freedom
fighter in any moral sense whatsoever. Any decent human  being  should  hold
that. Even if there might be some  merit  for  a  given  cause,  the  minute
terrorism is used to help that cause, it becomes  tainted  and  should  lose
all support. That response alone can tackle the root cause of terrorism.

But there is still an undercurrent that flows through this  House.  We  have
heard this, with respect, from the previous speaker,  through  some  of  the
provinces, from the ANC Youth League, and through echoes from other  corners
of the media, whispering that somehow America got  what  it  deserved.  This
kind of doubletalk and perniciousness should be stopped immediately.

The view has been expressed even by the Deputy Minister of  Foreign  Affairs
that policy should be  altered  in  the  Middle  East  and  elsewhere  as  a
consequence of this event. To now alter a standpoint - whatever  the  merits
of alteration might be as a consequence  of  a  terror  attack  -  is,  with
respect, to encourage further attacks.

With  terrorism  nationally  and  internationally,  one  cannot   temporise,
negotiate and appease it. It must be eliminated root  and  branch.  That  is
the global task for the 21st century.  There  is  a  clear  role  for  South
Africa to lead Africa in this campaign, the first campaign of this  century.
I believe that we will stand behind this Government  to  take  this  mission
forward if that is in fact what it does. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, hon members and His  Excellency
the Deputy President, in less than three hours on September  11,  the  world
witnessed on live television the unfolding dramatic events  leading  to  the
death of well over 6 000 people and tens of billions  of  dollars  worth  of
damage. The human, financial and political  toll  of  the  terrorist  attack
would have been much higher  had  the  fourth  hijacked  plane  reached  its
intended target and obliterated the entire White House complex.

We have heard the statement rendered to this House by the hon  the  Minister
of Foreign Affairs, Dr Dlamini-Zuma. We are now here to assess whether  what
she said expresses the foreign policy which our country needs at this  hour.
This is the time for this House to make its voice heard and complement  with
our utterances what our Foreign Minister said. Each of us  shall  carry  the
responsibility before history for what we dare say and  for  that  which  we
dare not say. In so doing,  we  need  to  take  heed  of  the  decisive  and
unconditional statements of condemnation made by  His  Excellency  President
Mbeki immediately after the attack.

The course of history has been changed, whether we like it or  not.  In  the
aftermath of 11 September a new system of foreign relations  has  tragically
become necessary. A dramatic dilemma faces each country  of  the  world.  No
longer is anyone allowed to sit on the fence or pledge neutrality  before  a
conflict which potentially affects everyone. Benjamin Netanyahu, the  former
Prime Minister of Israel, speaking  before  the  United  States  of  America
House of Representatives'  government  reform  committee  on  20  September,
stated that today we are all Americans in grief and defiance.

On 11 September we watched pandemonium broadcast live for all  our  eyes  to
see, with its images incessantly repeated on the following days.  This  type
of attack was not on the United States but on  the  united  states,  for  it
was, indeed, an attack against all of us as members of the human family.  It
is clear that  the  conflict  is  between  any  established,  organised  and
civilised society operating under the rule  of  law  and  forces  which  are
inimical to the values of civilisation, progress, law and order.

The outcome of this conflict will determine whether, throughout  the  world,
we can maintain open and pluralistic societies in which individuals can  act
with the maximum freedom to do maximum good or evil. Within  the  parameters
of this conflict, there is  no  place  for  hesitation  or  ambivalence.  As
politician we all know that sometimes, in politics and diplomacy,  there  is
room for ambivalence and vacillation by making minimal statements.  This  is
not the time for that. We must go beyond ritual  expressions  of  condolence
and empathy to state unequivocally that we suffered an attack  on  the  very
values on which our own democracy and social coexistence are founded. It  is
therefore in this sense an attack on South Africa.

We are not alone in feeling this way. From  the  Urals  to  the  Andes,  the
greatest coalition of forces in recorded  history  has  pledged  its  mutual
alliance to fight this war and has  mobilised  the  most  powerful  military
machinery of all time. It is not the United States going it  alone,  because
it is not the United States alone which was attacked. For  any  country  and
people who believe in the values of civilisation and progress  must  rightly
feel that they are now under siege by  an  invisible  and  yet  ever-present
enemy.

We have expressed our sympathy and condolences to  the  government  and  the
people of the United States and conveyed to them that we are  with  them  in
their hour of sorrow. We must now pledge to be with them in the  many  hours
of war to come when the going will become tough and  some  of  their  allies
may have second thoughts and qualify their prior support.

It is not merely a matter of seeking rightful retaliation. It is not just  a
matter of bringing the culprits to justice, or justice  to  them.  First  of
all, it is a matter of  ensuring  that  never  again  will  the  fundamental
principles of law, order and civilisation, upon which all our societies  are
founded, be undermined in so cowardly and fundamental  a  fashion.  We  must
pledge not only our friendship, but also our  alliance  to  all  the  forces
which will be mobilised on the military, diplomatic  and  logistical  fronts
in the war against terrorism.

I have been a friend of the United States throughout my  life.  I  recognise
the enormous contribution that the United  States  made  to  our  liberation
struggle. I recognise that no other country in history has ever mustered  so
much power as the United States - not to  oppress  its  neighbours,  but  to
bring about freedom, progress and development throughout the world.

However, at this juncture, I am  not  speaking  on  the  strength  of  these
sentiments which I have always held for  a  country  which  is  rightly  our
natural ally and most important friend. I am rather doing  so  because  this
attack  was  on  the  entire  civilised  world  and   we   have   an   equal
responsibility to react to it along with any other country which  wishes  to
regard itself as civilised.

The truth of this statement lies also in the  consequences  of  this  attack
for the world at large. The World  Bank  economic  assessment  released  two
days ago, gives the measure of the social impact of this attack, which  took
place in the middle of an economic recession.

In all likelihood, as many as 10 million more people will have  to  live  in
poverty in developing countries next year. Before the  attack,  the  overall
growth rate of developing countries was expected to fall from 5,5%  to  only
2,9% as a consequence of the economic showdown,  while,  after  the  attack,
their growth rate is expected to be as low as 0,5%.

The poorest countries of the world will suffer the most and will  fall  into
even deeper recession  as  a  result  of  a  decline  in  exports,  tourism,
commodity prices and foreign investment, and the  number  of  people  living
below the breadline of $1 per day will rise. An additional 20 000 to  40 000
children under five years of age could die  if  poverty  worsens.  The  area
worst hit will be Africa where, in addition  to  the  possible  increase  in
poverty for two to three million people as a  result  of  lower  growth  and
income, a further two million people may be condemned to live below  the  $1
per day breadline due to the effects of falling commodity prices.

These figures indicate the extent to which we ourselves have  been  attacked
and our lives destroyed. They also indicate  how  much  our  development  is
linked to that of the United States, willy-nilly, and how much  our  country
owes  to  that  country  in  terms  of  assistance  and  hope  for  our  own
development.

Our continent's further development and its final emancipation from  poverty
depend  on  successful  and  socially  equitable  globalisation  driven   by
countries such as the United States. At this critical juncture  in  history,
let us have no illusions. The world does not  owe  us  any  development  and
prosperity  and  we  have  no   corresponding   entitlement.   I   say   so,
notwithstanding the very  encouraging  remarks  Prime  Minister  Blair  made
yesterday in Blackpool. He was talking about this very same thing  and  said
that Africa needed attention. He said that the conscience of the world  must
be focused on Africa.

Within the context of global development, we can earn a greater  measure  of
support for our own progress. Only within such parameters are plans such  as
the New Africa Initiative viable. I have no fear in saying this,  for  these
are the facts of the matter. The further growth of the United  States  is  a
condition for  our  own  development,  which  should  not  be  a  source  of
resentment, but rather one of appreciation.

We might not know who actually launched the 11 September  attack  which  has
so  deeply  threatened  our  economic  development  and  social   stability.
However, we know that there are certain groups in  Afghanistan  which,  even
though they may not be directly responsible for  this  latest  and  dramatic
attack, have undoubtedly been involved in promoting and supporting the  same
type of terrorism. They are undoubtedly part and  parcel  of  the  enemy  we
must be committed to fighting. We must pledge  our  support  to  any  action
taken for their eradication.

In identifying the multifaceted nature of the enemy confronting us, we  must
also go to the root of  the  problem  and  realise  that  wherever  lack  of
democracy exists and fundamentalism dwells,  cultural  milieus  exist  which
may continue to breed unbalanced people prone to terrorism. We must  declare
war on any type of intolerant religious or ideological fanaticism.  The  war
on terrorism can no longer tolerate regimes which are  not  devoted  to  the
full respect of individual rights, are not  democratically  accountable  and
may divert resources towards terrorism. A globalising world  can  no  longer
tolerate undemocratic and regressive pockets which have  opted  to  insulate
themselves from the call for progress, civilisation and democracy.

In a globalising world, the evils of oppression can no longer  be  confined.
The germs of terrorism, social instability and oppression have now  found  a
pernicious way of infecting the whole body of civilisation. The current  war
against terrorism is to protect the civilised world which, make no  mistake,
we belong to, and we must belong to.

Those who feel differently and do not want to  join  in  this  war,  may  be
suggesting that we belong to a  different  world  from  the  one  which  has
pledged itself to the values which underpin our very Constitution.  We  dare
not make such a statement through hesitation in our debates. We  must  fight
the war against any type  of  fundamentalism  and  intolerance  in  our  own
country, while  giving  full  assistance  to  any  reasonable  action  taken
abroad.
We must make sure that no one makes the  mistake  of  believing  that  South
Africa can be or can become a safe haven for terrorists or  fundamentalists.
We must begin here and now, and, to this end, let us speak up to  make  sure
that we can stop in time that which otherwise is bound  to  damage  us  very
seriously and for many years to come. [Applause.]

Mr M RAMGOBIN: Madam Speaker, as a nation diverse in  our  composition,  but
hopefully united in our vision, we stand at the  threshold  of  the  African
century. As a nation, who better than us understands  the  shame  of  wanton
violence, killings and the degradation of human lives. We  in  the  ANC,  as
led by our President, unreservedly condemn  the  terrorist  attacks  in  New
York and Washington. We do so because we revere  life,  justice  and  peace,
because no matter what the end or  objective,  it  must  never  justify  the
means, and because we are committed to the welfare of all.

Anything short of our condemnation of terrorism will indeed  be  a  negation
of our gifts of ubuntu and the Gandhian trinity of  ahimsa,  satyagraha  and
sarvodaya. This is why the ANC emphasises, in the words  of  the  President,
that all human beings everywhere will surely be engulfed by a deep sense  of
shame that human society is  still  capable  of  producing  people  who  can
deliberately plan and execute a crime as  hideous  as  the  crime  that  was
perpetrated in the United States on September 11.

Our condemnation of this hideous crime is a principled one. It is not  based
on political, economic or religious  expediency.  It  will  augur  well  for
South Africans in particular, and Africa in general, not  to  get  embroiled
in interventions  designed  to  fight  terrorism  that  will  cause  further
disorder in our world.

Since 1912,  and  particularly  in  1994,  we  in  the  ANC  symbolised  and
demonstrated  to  the  world,  that  human  society  is  not  divided   into
political, social and religious  compartments.  Because  of  the  fact  that
human life is an undivided whole, there cannot be a line between ethics  and
politics.

It is in this context of current events in  our  world  that  we  must  feel
compelled to condemn terrorism; to condemn the  use  of  napalm  bombs  that
incinerated parts of Vietnam; to condemn the training, aiding  and  abetting
of bandits like Savimbi or even  Bin  Laden  and  the  Taliban;  to  condemn
institutions like the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a  British-
Pakistani institution, which not only engaged in money  laundering  but  was
also used to fund the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan.

We, in the ANC, in associating ourselves with the world  that  condemns  all
these vulgarities in human activity, will further condemn, with vigour,  the
denial of self-determination of the Palestinian people. For those of us  who
suffer the temptation  of  arrogance  in  pursuit  of  a  Hindu  crusade,  a
Christian crusade, a Zionist crusade or an Islamic Jihad, all of  which  are
hypocritically called holy, there is a profound lesson to  be  learned  from
our own ubuntu, which for  me  is  an  inspiration  that  there  can  be  no
religion apart from human activity.

This human activity, whether at the hands of  the  Savimbis,  the  suspected
Bin Ladens, the Talibans or the forces pitched against  them,  must  neither
countenance nor tolerate the degradation and destruction of  our  children's
safety and security, freedom and peace, and the  world  as  such,  when  the
preservation  of  sectarian  interests  are  engaged  with  the   might   of
terrorism.

This does not mean that economic terrorism  as  practised  by  one  or  more
individuals, groups or syndicates on the stockmarket of the developed  world
- the consequences of which were seen  in  Asia,  but  especially  in  South
Korea - must be ignored, nor does it  mean  that  globalisation,  warts  and
all, should be allowed to run rampant in an unbridled  form  without  checks
and balances. For without these checks and balances, are we not coerced  and
terrified into compliance with a system not of our choice?

Are coercion, terror, fear and force not the enemies of democracy? They  are
indeed the objectives of terrorism. How else do we view the assaults in  the
US? How else do we view the terrorism unleashed in Botswana, Angola,  Zambia
and Mozambique by apartheid  South  Africa?  Apartheid,  too,  was  given  a
sanctimonious piety by the proponents when it was  called  a  crime  against
humanity by the rest of the world.

In the current civilisational crisis that we face it is not the  prerogative
of any political or faith system to arrogate to itself  that  it  alone  can
offer a social practice that will produce a genuine social  form  suited  to
and directed at the fulfilment of human needs and the protection  of  mother
earth.

Agreement based on consensus for the forms necessary has to be  reached  for
progress and harmony. But in the absence of harmony for progress, be  it  in
the fears of human rights,  our  fight  against  racism,  our  struggles  to
protect our environment through worthy protocols like Kyoto, our  opposition
to wars and occupation of other people's land and many more,  we  will  soon
be on the doorstep of witnessing  the  sordid  thought  that  the  competing
systems will, before long, complete the gamut of civilisation's history.

In our choices and  activities  we  need  to  ask  ourselves  which  of  our
principles make or contribute to a universal  defensible  moral  compulsion.
Which of these  is  destined,  not  to  destruction  and  disorder,  but  to
enlightenment and understanding founded on a voluntary assent by  which  we,
as humans, will confirm to be  the  result  of  perfectly  free  discussion,
thereby becoming the walking symbols of ubuntu.

We,  as  South  Africans,  have  to  heed  the  consequences  of  terrorism.
Terrorism is a moral aberration, no matter how pious the rationalisation  by
any so-called crusade or holy war. We have to heed the consequences  on  our
continent's  recovery  programme,  with  special  reference  to   democratic
governance.

Terrorism and democracy just do not gel, and because of  that  it  is  vital
that the alliance against terrorism must not be contaminated by  the  states
that harbour, train, fund and deploy terrorist, as was  the  case  just  two
nights ago in Kashmir.  Any  disregard  of  this  by  the  alliance  against
terrorism must be construed to mean that its efforts are directed to a  mere
geopolitical manoeuvring.

To the hon the Leader of the Opposition, yes, indeed,  we  do  remember  all
those vulgarities in South Africa.  We  also  remember  the  shrapnel-laden,
dead bodies in Lesotho. We also remember the bodies  of  Samora  Machel,  as
well as Victoria and Griffiths Mxenge, and I as a person also  remember  the
body of my dead 29 year old son. Are they following me? [Interjections.]  Do
they remember that they were the propagandists of  the  SADF,  which  caused
his death. [Applause.]

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, Deputy President and  hon  members  of  this
House, once again we extend our sincerest condolences to  the  families  and
friends of the victims of the terror attacks on 11 September 2001.

The UDM wishes to commend the way in which the US has  handled  this  matter
to date. The restraint they have shown thus far  has  placated  the  nations
and markets of the world, all of whom were nervous of a  knee-jerk  military
retaliation. Equally, we commend the  South  African  Government  for  their
handling of the matter, despite the  impression  being  created  in  certain
quarters that South Africa is not co-operating with the US.

South Africans should know  that  the  present  Government  does  have  good
relations with the  US.  A  few  examples  should  suffice  to  prove  this.
Firstly, it was the US who appealed to South  Africa  to  negotiate  through
former  President  Mandela  the  release  of   Lockerby   suspects   to   an
international court. Secondly, our Government and the US  arranged  for  the
training of the Scorpions by the  US  government.  Thirdly,  it  is  the  US
government who sent FBI officials to assist with the investigation into  the
Cape Town bombings. Even former  President  Mandela  and  President  Mbeki's
bodyguards received US training. Therefore, South African co-operation  with
the US must be seen in the above context.
We disagree with those who say the  South  African  Government  should  have
handled the matter differently. [Applause.] South  Africans  should  cherish
the freedoms we  have  here.  Whatever  role  South  Africa  plays  in  this
international campaign must be carefully weighed. For example,  the  Clinton
administration  received  our  co-operation  in  the  Lockerby  matter,  but
reneged on their promise  to  lift  the  sanctions  against  Libya.  In  the
process former President  Mandela's  credibility  was  damaged.  [Applause.]
When we  co-operate,  it  must  be  on  the  basis  of  mutual  honesty  and
commitment.

 Lastly, if South Africa is in a position to advise on  how  the  matter  of
Bin Laden  is  handled,  we  recommend  as  follows.  Convince  the  US  and
Afghanistan to avoid military conflict.  Follow  the  Lockerby  example  and
bring the accused before an international court in a neutral venue.

This will give the US, Afghanistan and  Mr  Bin  Laden  the  opportunity  to
state their case and provide evidence for and against.

In this  way,  we  will  avoid  war  that  involves  the  innocent,  prevent
accusation of an unfounded witch-hunt and defuse this perceived war  between
religions. But perhaps, most importantly, it gives the US and those who  co-
operate with them, like South Africa, the opportunity to prove that  we  can
respond to terrorism and barbarism in a civilised and even-handed way.

We must avoid being drawn into a conflict which forces  us  to  abandon  the
very rights we seek to defend. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

Adv Z L MADASA:  Madam  Speaker,  almost  everyone  and  every  nation  have
condemned the  attack  on  the  US.  The  ACDP  unequivocally  condemns  the
terrorist attack on the US.

There is ample evidence that Afghanistan is  harbouring  groups  responsible
for terrorism even if not necessarily this particular act of  terrorism.  We
must all fight against global terrorism. The  US  and  Britain  have  stated
that the attack will be aimed at specific targets presumed or  known  to  be
the origin of the US attack. The debate, therefore, today  should  be:  What
is the appropriate action under international law.

Self-defence is expressly  authorised  by  the  UN  Charter  and  refers  to
defence against armed attack and may  include  counterattack,  for  example,
the Entebbe Raid in Uganda. Self-defence  is  usually  difficult  to  invoke
when the action complained of has taken place and  is  history.  Today,  the
issue  is  no  longer  self-defence,  or  whether  it   is   internationally
acceptable, but whether, under the circumstances, it can be pursued.

Hon Minister Zuma told the House that hon Presidents  Bush  and  Mbeki  have
agreed to work together to  gather  information  about  the  US  attack.  We
applaud this, but the planned attack on Afghanistan,  as  Kofi  Annan  said,
must still  be  sanctioned  by  the  United  Nations  and  comply  with  the
requirements of international law. As hon Presidents  Bush  and  Mbeki  have
agreed,  the  attack  must  not  be  collective  punishment  but  should  be
targeted, specific and avoid loss of innocent lives. South Africa  must  put
in place all necessary measures, here at home, to  deal  with  international
terrorism. [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Madam  Speaker,  more  people  were  killed  by  the  suicide
hijackers last week than the number  of  American  soldiers  killed  in  the
entire American revolution, or  in  the  bloodiest  one-day  battle  of  the
American civil war. More people were  killed  in  New  York  than  at  Pearl
Harbour during World War II. More people were killed than on D-Day in  1944.
America and the world will never be the same again after 11 September.

What did the terrorists do? The terrorists have learned how to turn  two  of
America's biggest strengths, openness and technology, into  weapons  against
the American people.  Armed  with  pocket  knives  they  transformed  United
States Airlines into guided missiles, flying bombs packed  with  60  gallons
of explosive fuel. It is chilling to think what  they  could  accomplish  if
they get their hands on the peak of military science, the nuclear bomb.  May
that never happen, and I have said that before.
Therefore, nobody, at the moment, in the  world  is  safe.  Everybody  must,
therefore, make a choice. One is either for or against terrorism.  There  is
no neutral position as far as that is concerned.

Elkeen moet kies: 'n Mens is of vir of teen terrorisme. Soos elke  regering,
moet ook Suid-Afrika kies vir  of  teen  terrorisme.  Hierdie  Regering  het
hulle uitgespreek  teen  die  terroriste-aanvalle  en  Suid-Afrika  se  hulp
aangebied. Die VF steun hulle daarin en glo dit is die regte  stap  en  moet
na buite baie sterk uitgedra word. Ons sal  ook  gesien  moet  word  in  die
uitvoer van die VN se  besluite  teen  terrorisme,  maar  dan  kan  ons  nie
dubbele standaarde handhaaf nie. Alle terrorisme  moet  veroordeel  word  na
alle kante toe. In die verlede kan ek hoeveel voorbeelde noem:  5  September
1972, toe elf atlete dood is by die  Spele  in  München,  en  die  Palestyne
verantwoordelikheid aanvaar het, is  terrorisme.  In  die  tagtigerjare  die
Deneyschengesin van Messina wat doodgemaak is in  'n  terroristeaanval.  Dit
was nie 'n militêre teiken nie. So kan ek aangaan. Die toets  gaan  wees  in
die toekoms of soortgelyke voorvalle  plaasvind  en  of  ons  konsekwent  na
buite optree en dit veroordeel. Die VF sal dit  wel  doen.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Everyone must choose: One is either for or against  terrorism.  Like  every
government, South Africa must also choose for  or  against  terrorism.  This
Government expressed itself against the terrorist attacks and offered  South
Africa's assistance. The FF supports them in this and  believes  it  is  the
right step and should be conveyed very strongly  to  the  outside.  We  will
also have to be seen to  be  putting  into  practice  the  UN's  resolutions
against terrorism, but then we cannot have double standards.  All  terrorism
must be condemned in every direction. I can mention any number  of  examples
from the past: 5 September 1972, when 11 athletes died at the Olympic  Games
in Munich and the Palestinians accepted responsibility,  was  terrorism.  In
the eighties the Deneyschen family of Messina  was  killed  in  a  terrorist
attack. It was not a military target. I can continue in this vein. The  test
will come in the future when similar attacks take place and whether  we  act
consistently to the outside and condemn them. The FF will in fact do so.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, hon  Deputy  President,  we  acknowledge
the sterling work done by the department and the  country's  willingness  to
assist the US, if approached to participate in military activities, and  the
expressed support to work with the United Nations to  deal  with  terrorism.
An issue of major concern, however, is the perception we are  creating  with
regard to dealing with terrorism, as intimated in the media: ``South  Africa
would not abide by what America wanted'', which appeared in The  Citizen  of
1 October 2001.

Such a statement is not only confusing, but  contradictory  to  the  initial
position taken by South Africa to work with  the  US  and  other  countries,
including the UN, to stamp out terrorism at the global level.  The  Ministry
of Foreign Affair's silence on the position adopted by the UN is  indicative
of our foreign policy's inconsistency with regard to dealing with issues  of
international importance.

Such suggestions of neutrality by the  South  African  Government  undo  the
good of the country and its standing  as  a  leading  country  committed  to
fighting terrorism. We must recall that our country was  the  first  amongst
other nations of the African continent to condemn the US  terrorist  attacks
on 11 September. This Act did not go unnoticed by the US president  and  the
larger public, resulting in the US government thanking  our  Government  for
its support and solidarity during the tragic events.

Therefore, we urge the Department of Foreign Affairs clearly  to  spell  out
its policy, consistently, so as not to put our country in a bad light  owing
to possible perceptions that South Africa's support for the US and,  indeed,
for the coalition against terrorism, is conditional. We can demonstrate  our
support to the US by not only complying  with  the  UN  resolution,  but  by
implementing it as well.

Matlo go sa mabapi, fifing go tshwaranwa  ka  diatla.  [People  should  help
carry each other's burdens. Unity is strength.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, the  11  September  act  of  terrorism  which
occurred in America is extraordinary. The  world  will  never  be  the  same
after this. It is unprecedented. It has great lessons for our  21st  century
world. The leaders of the world must now work harder to create  a  world  in
which all human beings on this planet are secure and  treated  equally.  The
old order in which the powerful bully the weak must change radically.

The PAC condemns terrorism in all its forms and  from  whatever  quarter  it
comes. The PAC has identified two kinds of terrorism in the world. They  are
non-state and state terrorism. Both forms cause much human suffering.

The people of Africa, through their own experience, can relate to the  grief
felt by many American  families  and  people  as  a  result  of  the  recent
terrorist bombings of  their  country.  This  is  because  Africa  has  been
terrorised for many years. Firstly, through the Trans-Atlantic  slave  trade
and through colonialism. Their lands, minerals and  all  their  wealth  were
seized from them by force. This terrorism  reduced  Africans  to  sub-humans
whose resources and labour were used  to  develop  foreign  countries  which
terrorised the African people.

 In modern times, through state terrorism organised from  abroad,  President
Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown, and Patrice Lumumba,  Maurice  Bishop,  Thomas
Sankara, and Amielca  Cabral  were  assassinated  to  make  way  for  puppet
regimes controlled by  foreign  states  practising  political  and  economic
terrorism. Foreign state terrorism interfered in Iran. It has killed over  2
million people in Iraq and bombed a pharmaceutical factory out of  existence
in Sudan.

To prevent terrorism in all its forms, all member  states  of  the  UN  must
strictly abide by its charter. Research must also be  conducted  as  to  the
root causes  of  terrorism,  so  that  conditions  which  are  conducive  to
terrorism may be prevented.
Non-state terrorists must be properly identified with evidence  before  they
are punished, to avoid punishing the wrong people and the loss  of  innocent
lives. Terrorism cannot be fought  with  terrorism.  A  state  which  fights
terrorism with terrorism joins the ranks of  terrorism.  It  shares  in  the
barbarism and atrocities of terrorism. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker,  the  MF  stills  feels  the  shock  of  the
American disaster on 11 September 2001, which has been at the cost  of  many
lives. The MF shares the sentiments that the perpetrators  must  be  brought
to justice, and that nations should unite to prevent all acts of terrorism.

The MF, though, strongly agrees with what the President  said  and  whatever
further advocated by the Minister, namely that the fight  against  terrorism
should not be seen as a fight against any religion, culture,  and  race,  as
well as an act of collective punishment and  guilt.  It  is  most  important
that peace be maintained for, as a nation, housing a  diversity  of  people,
it could hold serious consequences.
The MF agrees that the South African Government makes itself  available  for
assistance and works collectively within the  ambit  of  the  UN  to  combat
terrorism, and bring the perpetrators of this barbarism to justice.  The  MF
applauds  the  Minister's  immediate  action  and  the  strategy  that   was
implemented as a response to the US  disaster.  The  diplomacy  towards  the
USA, as well as the method of inquiry and  action  taken  as  regards  those
South Africans that might have fallen victims to the terror attack, was  not
only swift, but well inculcated.

The concern and assistance offered to the families and persons concerned  to
confirm the safety of their loved ones was accommodated and appreciated,  as
the safety of five of the seven missing South Africans has  been  confirmed.
The MF expresses its admiration and  humble  gratitude  for  the  assistance
that the Minister and her department have given to the family  of  the  late
Nick Rowe in arranging for the body to be transported back to  South  Africa
for burial.

The MF supports the Minister's actions  taken  in  response  to  the  terror
attack in the USA. However, the MF asks: What would our response be  if  our
military assistance were requested? [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, the core issue before this House today is  South
Africa's position in  the  new  international  scenario  that  has  unfolded
before us since 11 September 2001.

As a whole, the South African Government has  handled  the  situation  quite
well. In her speech, the Minister condemned  these  attacks  unconditionally
and pledged solidarity with the USA. Deputy Minister  Aziz  Pahad  has  done
the same last night on a show on television.

Die Suid-Afrikaanse regering se standpunt tot op hede is dié van hulp,  hulp
met intelligensiedienste, humanitêre hulp en samewerking in  die  proses  om
die skuldiges aan die kaak  te  stel.  Hiermee  gepaardgaande  is  daar  die
standpunt om nie militêr by die magsopbou in  die  Midde-Ooste  betrokke  te
raak nie. Hieroor wil ek meer sê.

Die AEB steun  dié  standpunt  met  voorbehoud.  As  die  redes  strategies-
logisties van aard is, ja. As die rede egter dui op neutraliteit  of  apatie
teenoor die totale teenaanslag teen fundamentalisme,  fanatisme  en  terreur
wêreldwyd, dán gaan Suid-Afrika baie seerkry.

Die gebeure van 11 September was nie maar 'n gewone misdaad waar  die  skelm
gevang, aangekla en vervolg moet word nie. Dít is hoe president Clinton  die
vorige drie aanslae gehanteer het, soek die skuldige en kyk wat het  gebeur.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The standpoint of the South African Government to  date  has  been  one  of
aid, aid with intelligence services, humanitarian aid  and  co-operation  in
the process of exposing the guilty parties. Together  with  this,  there  is
the standpoint of not becoming militarily involved in the power build-up  in
the Middle East. I would like to say some more about this.

The AEB supports this standpoint with reservations. If the reasons are of  a
strategic-logistical  nature,  yes.  However,  if   the   reason   indicates
neutrality  or   apathy   towards   the   total   counter   attack   against
fundamentalism, fanaticism and terror  world  wide,  then  South  Africa  is
going to get seriously hurt.

The events of 11 September did not represent a mere normal crime  where  the
villain is caught, arrested and prosecuted. This is  how  President  Clinton
dealt with the previous three attacks, seek the guilty  party  and  look  at
what happened.]

The 11 September 2001 incident was even more of an attack  than  an  act  of
terrorism to cause fear in the hearts and minds of the people  in  order  to
achieve political goals. It was an  act  of  total  devastation,  the  scale
thereof was so massive and was akin to a total destruction. It was,  indeed,
an act of war already, not by one country against another, but  by  faceless
forces of a fanatical underworld  against  freedom,  democracy  and  a  free
world.

The question facing South Africa is not that of  support  in  arresting  and
bringing to trial  the  criminals  and  their  accomplices.  Fanaticism  has
become the new  hostile  ideology.  The  worldwide  network  of  terrorists,
together with every government that hosts them or supports them, has  become
the enemy.

The question is: Where do we  stand  in  a  war  that  was  declared  on  11
September 2001? A war that will leave no country untouched until the  forces
of terror and destruction are eliminated?  Careful,  logical  and  strategic
reservations are advisable. Neutrality will be impossible. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, in  the  aftermath  of  the
horrific attack on 11 September 2001 that snuffed out thousands of lives  in
the United States, the  American  people  must  know  that  we  share  their
horror, pain and suffering. We sympathise with  all  those  who  lost  their
loved ones or were injured.

We support the view that our country and its security organs must take  part
in the search for and capture of the perpetrators of  these  acts,  so  that
they may be  brought  to  justice.  All  legitimate,  appropriate  and  fair
methods, preferably under the mandate and direction of the  United  Nations,
must be used to find those responsible. Azapo urges that in this  period  of
universal grief, the international community should take advantage  of  this
widespread consensus and unity to  create  a  fairer  and  more  just  world
order. Suicide bombers are bitter, weak and  desperate  people  who  believe
they have literally nothing to lose, including their own lives.

It is not a fair world if half a million  Iraqi  babies,  who  know  nothing
about Saddam Hussein, die of starvation and diseases because sanctions  have
been imposed against the Iraqi  government.  It  is  not  a  fair  world  if
civilians and children are killed and maimed in the Middle East  by  weapons
supplied by powerful nations of the world.

Let the search for these criminals be accompanied by vigorous  campaigns  to
create a more just world regime that does not breed  desperate  people.  The
United Nations, the United States and  Western  Europe  are  in  a  powerful
position to  bring  about  a  fair  settlement  in  the  Israeli/Palestinian
conflict and to save the Iraqi children from starvation, disease and  death.
Then the world struggle against the merchants of evil and death would  be  a
resounding success. [Applause.]

Miss M N MAGAZI: Madam Speaker, hon members, ladies and  gentlemen,  I  want
to start off by making a comment.

When I heard that the US has been attacked by terrorists,  the  first  thing
that I did was to  call  the  chairperson  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Defence, Comrade Thandi Modise. When  the  second  plane  crashed  into  the
second building, I immediately called Sis' Thandi and asked: ``Where is  the
President and the Minister of Defence?  Are  we  ready?''  I  was  checking.
[Interjections.] No, members, I do not  want  to  be  howled  down.  Members
should listen! [Interjections.]  I  was  checking  whether  we  were  ready,
whether our defence was ready. [Interjections.]

Last month the opposition party was howling, making a noise  in  this  House
about   defence   and   the   Government   spending   money   buying   arms.
[Interjections.] Today they are quiet and  they  are  not  making  a  noise,
because they are thinking: ``What if what happened in the  US  had  happened
here?'' They would start blaming the Government because it does  not  budget
more for security. [Interjections.] This is the kind of opposition we  have,
an opposition which shows arrogance.  [Interjections.]  This  is  what  they
know - they are a destructive opposition party that does not want to think.

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Where is the 4x4?

Miss M N MAGAZI: Madam Speaker, I do not know. I will start my  speech  now.
[Applause.]

Terrorism on whatever scale is an evil that the  world  does  not  need,  an
evil that can never be justified. It festers in the sick  minds  of  social,
economic and political outcasts; it serves no  noble  purpose  and  disrupts
normal life in a way that is irreversible, devastating and permanent.

That is why every person, group or nation with a modicum of respect for  the
sanctity of human life must, as we  do,  denounce  terrorism  unequivocally,
unconditionally and unambiguously, irrespective of where it occurs, who  the
target might be and what the rationale might be. As South Africans  we  must
be united in our resolve to do everything in our power to prevent  terrorism
from gaining a foothold within our borders, and strengthen  our  resolve  to
combat it wherever it occurs.

Because of the very unpredictable nature of  terrorism,  especially  on  the
scale that we witnessed on 11 September in New York and  Washington,  it  is
imperative that antiterrorist  efforts  be  unified,  co-ordinated  and  co-
operative in their make-up. We, as parliamentarians  representing  the  ANC,
support the stance of our own Government to  join  the  international  fight
against terror attacks. We believe there should be an  international  agency
that specialises in combating  terrorism  in  all  its  forms.  This  agency
should draw  on  the  expertise,  intelligence  capabilities,  investigative
capabilities and prosecutory ability of all nations.

We recognise that those who find it within themselves to  commit  such  acts
of cowardice and horror belong in the jungle, like the animals they are.  We
must, for our own sake and for the sake of those who  will  come  after  us,
uphold the very foundations of democracy  and  the  rule  of  law.  We  must
presume people innocent until they are proven  guilty.  We  must  insist  on
unbiased investigations. We must demand fair  judicial  processes.  We  must
require substantive, co-operative and incontrovertible evidence.  These  are
our tools to mete out the kind of  harsh,  severe  and  exacting  punishment
needed to deny terrorists a future; punishment in the same spirit as in  the
cases  of  similar  crimes  committed  in  Rwanda  and  Lockerby,  where  an
international specialist court metes out justice to the responsible  persons
or parties.

Such countermeasures are proactive and will serve a  curative  purpose.  But
as a preventative measure, we also need to look at the causes  of  terrorism
throughout the world, and attend  to  them  in  a  manner  that  renders  it
unnecessarily. The undeniable truth  is  that  the  foreign  policy  of  the
United States is highly problematic for most  countries  in  the  developing
world. We need to appeal to the inherent sense of reason  and  soberness  of
mind of the American government to actively review its  foreign  policy  and
its effects on the developing nations of the world. [Applause.]  It  is  our
duty to caution against the kind of war rhetoric we  have  been  hearing  up
till now. It does a disservice to the attempts by President Bush to  form  a
global coalition against terrorism when we hear statements like:  ``This  is
a declaration of war, we are at war''. [Time expired.]
The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, let me first  of  all
thank  the  many  speakers  from  the  Government  side,  as  well  as   the
responsible ones from the opposition, who constructively attempted  to  deal
with this very challenging issue of terrorism.

A French philosopher once said that an idea can be dangerous if  it  is  the
only idea that one has. Unfortunately, the DA seems to have only  one  idea,
and that is to use every occasion and every  issue  to  make  cheap,  party-
political points. [Interjections.]

I want to say that the hon Tony Leon was given 12 minutes to waste our  time
here. In fact the only correct thing he said - and there was very little  in
what he said that was correct - was not new. Indeed, it has been  Government
policy for many years. But when  he  tried  to  say  something  newer,  more
constructive   and   more   philosophical,   it   was   totally   incorrect.
[Interjections.]

Let me say that today, in the wake of the terrorist attack of 11  September,
the  world  is  faced  with  a  very  dangerous  situation.  The  born-again
antiterrorists, who sound like the new warlords of the world, will not  help
us tackle this issue.

It is very interesting to  note  that  the  hon  Tony  Leon  has  made  such
strident calls today to fight terrorism and asked us  to  implement  certain
resolutions. But he formulated  his  suggestions  in  such  a  way  that  he
sounded like he was trying to prove that the South African Government -  and
indeed, the South African people - are not committed to fighting  terrorism.
He tried to suggest that we support terrorism. [Interjections.]

I want to say that this is an absolutely dangerous angle that  this  defunct
opposition is  taking.  Let  me  point  out  that  within  hours  after  the
terrorist act, South Africa unreservedly condemned the attack. We called  it
a crime against humanity; we said that such a crime  demanded  a  collective
determination to  fight  and  defeat  terrorism,  which  is  an  affront  to
humanity. We went further and said that South Africa  recognises  the  right
of the US government to track down the culprits and bring them  to  justice.
Finally, we gave our commitment to co-operate with all efforts to  apprehend
the culprits and bring them to book. But, unlike the warlords, we said  that
any action that is taken, must be  informed  by  incontrovertible  evidence.
This  is  a  position  that  the  whole  world   has   taken   since   then.
[Interjections.]

The hon Leon now passionately appeals to us to joint the  coalition  against
terrorism - he never did this in his  young  days  -  and  to  implement  UN
Security Council resolutions. He demands that we meet the 90  day  deadline.
I do not even think that he has read the resolution,  but  I  am  coming  to
that. He seems to forget that South Africa is one of the  leading  countries
which co-sponsor and support antiterrorist resolutions in the UN,  the  OAU,
SADC, NAM and many other multilateral institutions that we are  members  of.
[Interjections.]

Let me remind these windbags on my  left  that  the  OAU,  at  a  summit  in
Algeria in 1999, held a convention on terrorism which had many  elements  of
the OAU convention which are now part of Security Council  Resolution  1373.
I will ask the members to read this OAU resolution.

At a conference in Durban NAM made a resolution  on  terrorism  which  urged
all states to co-operate in enhancing the  fight  against  terrorism.  Again
NAM, like the OAU, identified positions which are part of  resolution  1373.
So we do not need to be taught how to fight terrorism. In fact,  the  right-
wing reaction that  has  been  reflected  on  my  left,  is  an  element  of
terrorism that we must fight. [Applause.]

I cannot understand what the hon Leon means when he says that  the  UN  must
give legitimacy to the fight against terrorism, but then warns us  that  its
veto powers must not be used to prevent military actions. This is  illogical
and  nonsensical.  The  UN  is  the  only  instrument  through   which   any
international coalition can be formed to fight terrorism.  The  sooner  they
wake up to that, the better it will be.

I want to suggest to these windbags that they study Resolution 1373 and  the
negotiations in which we participated. This resolution imposes a  series  of
binding  obligations  on  member  states  and   they   have   very   serious
implications. One of the things we need to do is to  start  the  process  of
ensuring that we have a genuine international  definition  of  terrorism  or
terrorist  acts.  Without  a  definition  of  this,  we  can  open  up   the
international body politic to actions that will take us to the precipice  of
absolute anarchy and the rule of the jungle.

Let me further say that there is a UN ad hoc committee on terrorism that  is
currently elaborating on a comprehensive convention on terrorism which  will
serve as an overarching treaty that incorporates  key  elements  of  the  12
existing antiterrorism conventions. South Africa is playing a major role  in
this ad hoc committee.

Let me then just inform this lot here that unlike them, we fully  appreciate
that terrorism seeks to put itself above and outside the  law.  In  tracking
down and bringing terrorists to justice, we must reaffirm the  rule  of  law
at the national and international level. As I  said  before,  we  can  never
allow any actions to enable the rule of the jungle to become  the  basis  of
international relations.

The hon Leon does not mention the dangers that  his  type  of  verbosity  is
raising. We have consistently said  that  in  fighting  terrorism,  we  must
avoid using the right-wing arguments that this is a clash of  civilisations,
something which the hon Leon uses all the time. We have to start  mobilising
the people to fight from wherever it comes, and that it  cannot  be  equated
to any  religion,  culture  or  language.  Therefore,  the  Tony  Leons  who
consistently talk of fundamentalist Islamist  terrorists  are  playing  into
the hands of many ... [Interjections.]

Let me further say that the Security Council resolution - which he  has  not
read - says that the Security Council expresses concern  at  the  increasing
... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, on a point or order: Is the hon  the  Deputy
Minister allowed to tell lies in his speech?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, you  cannot  say  that  the  hon  the
Deputy Minister  is  telling  lies.  [Interjections.]  Please  proceed,  hon
Deputy Minister.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Madam Speaker, he is wasting my time! [Interjections.]

Tony Leon  and  his  cohorts  do  not  understand  that,  when  we  talk  of
terrorism, we have to talk about all forms of terrorism. The terrorism  that
took place in New York and Washington is different from  the  Oklahoma  bomb
terrorism. It is different from  the  terrorism  that  is  taking  place  in
Algeria, Egypt, Angola, Sri Lanka  and  Kashmir.  Therefore,  one  needs  to
understand the totality of what one is talking about.

An HON MEMBER: You do not understand anything!

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Secondly, Tony Leon accuses the ANC of  taking  certain
positions, and in his stupid article in The Citizen he accused  the  ANC  of
being anti-American and anti-Semitic. These are  very  dangerous  positions,
which I want to elaborate on.

We have consistently said that, in order to eliminate terrorism we  have  to
get to the root causes and eradicate  them,  otherwise  we  will  live  with
terrorism. In this context we have to stop the conflicts in  the  world.  As
far as conflicts go, the Middle East conflict is one of the  most  important
conflicts that have given rise to many forms of terrorist activities.

Let me remind members that nearly 20  years  ago,  in  September  1982,  the
Falangist movement in Lebanon carried out an orgy of killings and  rapes  in
the Shatma and Shatila camps in Lebanon. This followed the Israeli  invasion
of Lebanon, which was designed to drive the  PLO  out  of  the  country  and
resulted in the death of over 17 000 Palestinians and Lebanese,  almost  all
civilians.  That  sort  of  terrorism  gave  rise  to  the  Black  September
movement. So we must not ignore these issues. [Interjections.]

Let me just go on.  The  Secretary  General,  on  24  September,  given  the
developments after the ceasefire in the Middle East, expressed concern  that
the Israeli defence force had established a  closed  military  zone  in  the
northern part of the occupied Palestinian territory. He went on to say  that
the creation of such a zone would  impose  additional  restrictions  on  the
Palestinians. He said it was a unilateral and provocative  act  contrary  to
all agreements, and could only undermine ongoing efforts  to  find  the  way
out of the present crisis. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I  regret  your  time  has  expired,  hon  Deputy
Minister. [Applause.] Hon Nel?

Mr A C NEL: MADAM Speaker,  during  the  course  of  the  Deputy  Minister's
input, Mr Leon referred to the Deputy  Minister  as  ``dishonest,  deceitful
and unfit to hold office'', and I submit that  that  is  unparliamentary.  I
request that you ask him to withdraw.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Leon, did you say  those  words,  and  if  you  did,
could you please withdraw? [Interjections.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Yes, I did, and I do.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, on a further point of order: During the  hon
the Deputy Minister's address, he purported to quote the speech of  the  hon
Mr Leon, and he did so using notes which were drawn up before  Mr  Leon  had
spoken. He wilfully misquoted him, and in fact  told  lies  -  there  is  no
other description of it. I think the  hon  the  Deputy  Minister  should  be
instructed to withdraw all the statements he made referring to  the  hon  Mr
Leon's speech. [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Deputy Minister, would you  like  to  respond
to that?

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Yes, Madam Speaker. Let me  quote  from  what  the  hon
member wrote in The Citizen [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Deputy Minister,  are  you  now  quoting  exactly
what you quoted in your speech, ie are you quoting from what was reported?

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Yes, Madam  Speaker.  I  was  simplifying  it  for  the
simple-minded!

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker, is there a point of order here?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon  Nel,  the  Deputy  Minister  would  like  to
respond, so let us give him the opportunity to do so.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Madam Speaker, they said I was  misquoting  and  lying.
Here is what he said. He said:
  It has been said the mass murder in America last week was somehow brought
  about by the country's foreign policy in the Middle East. This  has  been
  articulated in some editorials and by certain ANC politicians. Underlying
  this is a pervasive anti-Americanism often accompanied  by  anti-Semitism
  and inspired more by envy than by facts or compelling argument.

He goes on to say many more things.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I think what the DP's Chief Whip  is
pointing out is that what is being quoted is actually not  what  the  Leader
of the Opposition said.  However  ...  [Interjections.]  Order!  However,  I
think the issue here is that the  Deputy  Minister  is  actually  quoting  a
newspaper article.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Yes!

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: So it is not so much whether or not the  Leader  of  the
Opposition indeed did say those words.
The DEPUTY MINISTER: And he said it on many occasions!

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The newspaper itself says so: it is  not  so  much  that
the Deputy Minister himself is saying what  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition
said, as he is quoting an article in a newspaper. So the issue of him  lying
does not arise, because he is just quoting from a newspaper  article,  which
in fact he is holding. Yes, hon Asmal?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, can you please ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Asmal, please do not start an  argument  with
members of the opposition.

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, can you tell me what the point of order  is  if
one is misquoted? Where does it say that to misquote someone is a  point  of
order?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Minister, please take your  seat!  I  do  not
want the business of the House this afternoon to be diverted by  this  whole
debate about what the Deputy Minister said. If there is any  further  reason
for this issue to be followed up, it will not be now. We will now sort  this
matter out outside, if  there  is  any  reason  for  doing  so.  The  Deputy
Minister has explained why he said what he said, and that is that.

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!
Mr E SALOOJEE: Chairperson, in relation  to  what  Mr  Gibson  has  said,  I
really believe that I  would  be  justified  in  asking  him:  When  Mr  Abe
Williams was charged ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  member,  I  cannot  accept
that as a point of order. You may have your viewpoints on that, but this  is
not the time to state that.

Dr P J RABIE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:

  (1) notes with alarm that the rand has recently declined to more than  R9
       to the US dollar;

       people are benefiting from the multimillion rand programme;


  (3) expresses its dismay that the initiative has yet to complete its four-
       year business plan; and

day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:

       (a)   on  Monday,  1  October  2001,  Telkom  celebrated   its   10th
           anniversary;


       (b)  over the past 10 years Telkom  SA  has  undergone  a  number  of

       (c)  Telkom was given a period of exclusivity to improve on universal
           service targets;
  (2)  acknowledges  that  over  the  past  decade  of   telecommunications
       restructuring, Telkom has performed remarkably well in meeting  these

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  our marine resources are being depleted by unscrupulous  persons
           and companies; and


       (b)  certain fishing companies are amongst those  guilty  of  illegal
           practices;


  (2) welcomes the invoking of section 29 of the  Marine  Living  Resources
       Act by the Minister  of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism,  which
       enabled the Minister to  cancel  the  fishing  rights  of  a  fishing
       company after the laws and regulations under which its fishing rights
       were granted had been breached; and


  (3) commends the Minister on this action, which is a first for the  South
       African fishing industry, and trusts that this action will serve as a
       deterrent for other fishing  companies  engaged  in  illegal  fishing
       activities.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the MF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the ancient Indian pilgrimage to the great river Ganges in India
           has been a magnet to thousands of pilgrims, who venture to these
           waters to wash away their sins;


       (b)  whatever piety this river may hold, it has become a dumping pool
           for millions of litres of waste and other water pollutants; and


       (c)  a national Ganges cleansing project has  been  launched  at  the
           Sanchat Mochan Foundation in India;


  (2) calls on the Indian community and the parties concerned to aid in the
       cleansing of this sacred river;


  (3) acknowledges that even though the Ganges River is polluted and  noted
       as the most polluted watercourse in  the  world,  it  is  still  very
       sacred, pure and holy and that many from around the world,  including
       South Africans, embark upon this passage; and


  (4) calls on everyone to make it safer  and  to  preserve  its  symbolism
       caringly.

[Applause.]

Mrs F MAHOMED: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that since 1 July 2001, two million South Africans have started
       receiving free basic water;


  (2) believes that this reflects the commitment of the ANC-led  Government
       to improving the quality of life by ensuring that each household  has
       access to safe and clean water; and


  (3) commends the work done by the Department of Water Affairs in ensuring
       that more families have access to clean water.

[Applause.]

Mr N S BRUCE: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay  the  decision  to  give  Lotto  money,  meant  for
       charitable causes, to sports bodies,  including  professional  sports
       such as soccer and rugby;


  (2) considers it a disgrace that millions of rands  have  been  given  to
       professional sport when organisations which  seek  to  relieve  human
       suffering are  in  serious  financial  trouble  of  the  Government's
       making;


  (3) questions the ANC's commitment to improving the lives of the poor and
       the needy by allowing this callous decision-making;


  (4) calls on the Auditor-General to conduct a special  enquiry  into  the
       National Lotteries Board to ensure that equity and  transparency  are
       part of the funds allocation decision; and


       (a)  despite the depredations of the Lotteries Board,  congratulates
           the Scorpions on their acquisition of  a  second-hand  Mercedes-
           Benz 4x4 and encourages them to expose the cupidity that is  the
           cause of corruption and the scourge of honest governance.

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) regrets that -


       (a)   RDP  houses  in  Mpumalanga  Province  are  a  possible   life-
           threatening risk due to shoddiness in construction; and


       (b)  building inspectors in the said province were forced to demolish
           90 homes this week in fear that they  might  collapse  and  kill
           residents; and


  (2) is appalled that many of these houses also  leak  even  during  light
       rains; and


  (3) calls on the Minister of Housing  to  see  to  it  that  such  shoddy
       building contractors rebuild the houses at their own cost.

Mrs Z A KOTA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1)  notes  the  ANC  in  the  Western  Cape's  decision  to  assume  the
       chairpersonship of four of  the  16  subcouncils  in  the  Cape  Town
       unicity;


  (2) believes that this strategic decision will benefit the poor people in
       the areas the ANC will control, especially those in  Khayelitsha  and
       Mitchells Plain which  have  been  identified  by  the  ANC  national
       Government for urban renewal;


  (3) further believes that the benefits of  the  ANC's  outward  focus  on
       development, upliftment and accelerated delivery will far exceed  the
       negative inward focus on separatism, backstabbing and  infighting  of
       the DA; and


  (4) calls on the people of Cape Town to unite with the ANC  to  speed  up
       change for a better life for all.

[Applause.]

Mr S SIMMONS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  a short-sighted culture of nonpayment for  services  in  certain
           parts of South Africa, encouraged by outdated ANC policies;


       (b)   that  the  local  governments  cannot  survive  financially  if
           citizens do not pay for services;


  (2) commends -




       (a)  the City of Cape Town for its sensible and steadfast  commitment
           to the culture of payment for services;


       (b)  the city for  the  patient,  passionate  and  impressively  firm
           action in assisting water payment  defaulters  in  Tafelsig  and
           elsewhere to make arrangements to commence paying; and


       (c)  the people of Mitchells Plain  who  have  immediately  commenced
           payments;


  (3) condemns those who have -


       (a)  sought confrontation with officials who  are  carrying  out  the
           law; and
       (b)  encouraged confrontation  in  order  to  score  cheap  political
           points; and


  (4) calls on the ANC Government and all provincial and local  governments
       to put a stop to the legacy of nonpayment in South Africa.

Ms A VAN WYK: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) calls on the Government to fulfil its constitutional responsibilities
       and serve the people of  South  Africa  by  implementing  a  national
       mother-to-child prevention plan as  part  of  a  national  integrated
       strategy to deal with HIV/Aids;


  (2) notes that the Government is out of touch with the daily realities of
       South Africans;
  (3)  expresses  its  disgust  that  President  Mbeki  is  tarnishing  our
       country's international image with his stubborn  ill-informed  stance
       on HIV/Aids, indicated by the  sharp  criticism  of  the  influential
       Washington Post; and


  (4) calls on all South Africans to  unite  in  their  fight  against  the
       challenges of HIV/Aids.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, in respect of  the
issue of the hon the Chief Whip of the Majority Party, you  know  very  well
that this matter is now within the judicial  process.  Any  inferences  that
any member makes regarding his guilt prior to  the  findings  of  the  court
cannot possibly be condoned by this  House.  I  would,  therefore,  like  to
caution you that  in  making  that  reference,  you  must  understand  quite
clearly the lines that are drawn and should not transgress them if you  want
to be on the right side of morality. So please  be  very  careful  when  you
make the inference, and what the words you use actually mean.

                         INTERNATIONAL TEACHERS' DAY

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, hon members, this is  a  very  happy
occasion. I address this House to acknowledge  the  worth  of  our  nation's
teachers,  and  to  recognise  and  applaud  the  important  work  they  do.
Goeiemiddag  onderwysers,  sanibonani  bothisha,  mfundisi-nsapho,  dumelang
barutabana, thobela barutishi [Good morning teachers].

I want to thank the House for allowing this time on this important  day.  We
will be joining over 100 countries  around  the  world,  whose  people  will
spare a special thought for the teacher, the teacher they  know  and  trust.
The day has been identified  by  Unesco  at  the  instigation  of  Education
International, a worldwide union of over 20 million teachers, for an  annual
celebration of the work of teachers.

As has already been mentioned on behalf of the Chief Whip  of  the  Majority
Party, there will be the special occasion in Mafikeng on Friday,  and  I  am
sure that they will be pleased to receive  this  message  from  this  House.
Today we have two special guests in this chamber,  the  chairperson  of  the
South African Council of Educators, Mr Abrahams, and his deputy,  Ms  Mpati,
who are joining us.
When they meet in Mafikeng, the  topic  will  be  ``Qualified  Teachers  for
Quality Education''. The emphasis on  qualifications  is  important  in  the
context of lifelong learning, and teachers  must  be  encouraged  to  ensure
that they have the minimum requirements for appointment.  The  opportunities
for them to upgrade are enormous, especially with the  introduction  of  the
National  Professional  Diploma  in  Education  as   a   special   upgrading
qualification. These  opportunities  must  be  grasped.  We  still  have  an
awesome legacy to overcome because of the apartheid mania for  separate  and
poor training and supervision of teachers.

But, of course, we must not assume -  do  not  go  by  headlines  -  that  a
qualified teacher is automatically a  good  teacher.  The  same  applies  in
respect of the qualifications  we  received  long  ago.  Updating  ourselves
should be part of our job and part of the role model we project. There  have
been huge changes in education and society:  new  knowledge  about  learning
has shaped the construction of  the  curriculum  and  the  pedagogues  which
deliver it. Most of all, the Constitution has introduced  a  set  of  values
which must underpin all behaviour. At the  same  time,  school  demographics
have changed, with much greater diversity of culture and  ethnicity  in  the
classroom, which also requires new approaches.

To meet the obligations to learners, the real teachers will  remain  out  in
front,  leading  the  nation  in  word  and  in  deed,  and  to  fulfil  the
relationship of trust which is fundamental to our  values.  I  call  on  all
South Africans to honour, in  whatever  way  they  can,  the  work  of  such
teachers.

Though teaching is valiant work, it is demanding work and it is too often  a
thankless task to be a teacher. Fortunately, for many  outstanding  men  and
women, it is also a godgiven  task  and  any  obstacles  are  surmounted  to
accomplish this task. Their  view  would  be  that  education  is  much  too
valuable to subject to the vagaries  of  circumstance;  learners  cannot  be
held to ransom for problems and factors beyond their control. This  must  be
the view of  any  honest  educator,  especially  those  who  wish  that  the
education budget was not held accountable to fiscal policy constraints.

These teachers are the representatives of stability, order  and  continuity.
They do not flinch in the face of adversity. They know that they  carry  our
heritage and our future on their shoulders. These teachers strive  for  more
and for better, achieving the kinds of miracles we are hearing so much  more
about recently and which we shall see more of when  our  President  presents
his annual teaching awards later this month.

For these teachers,  this  prestige  is  more  valuable  than  any  material
reward. It is an affirmation of their being and the evidence is to  be  seen
in the eyes of their learners; the honour and  the  respect  they  have  for
their  teachers  is  obvious.  This  is  someone  one   can   depend   upon.
Regrettably, in South Africa, we are celebrating World Teachers'  Day  in  a
context where some teachers are failing in their duty. As a nation, we  have
espoused many admirable values, which are contained in our Constitution  and
given practical effect in the Ministry's manifesto on Values, Education  and
Democracy.

We can expect teachers who are at the forefront of the  struggle  for  these
values to keep playing a leading role. It is intolerable,  but  we  hear  of
instances or cases where teachers do not work on days when they get paid  on
Friday. Also, we have to hear of a  terrible  500-page  report  compiled  by
members of a provincial legislature, with details of sexual abuse, rape  and
exploitation of learners. This occurred not  in  one  school,  but  in  many
schools. For all the  systematic  neglect  by  peers,  by  school  teachers,
parents and educational  authorities;  all  are  guilty  of  subverting  the
national democratic agenda, which never provided for this. So while this  is
not the rule, the practice seems widespread enough to  suggest  that  it  is
also not the exception.

No better  are  the  headlines  about  the  suspended  principal  of  Ermelo
Hoërskool, which I remember visiting in 1991. We must also be classified  as
counterrevolutionaries: Why? Because this is a revolution  of  the  mind-set
which we are slowly winning, and which we must win. Those  who  hold  office
and have authority over the vulnerable are under a  special  duty  of  care.
They must help to revive in some cases and  then  to  maintain  the  special
sense of duty.

Throughout the year 2000  there  was  a  great  deal  of  stability  in  the
education sector, particularly in the schooling area. This was evidenced  by
increased efforts  by  teachers,  principals  and  educational  managers  to
ensure improved results, especially at matric level. I want  to  thank  very
much those teachers who worked the weekends, who took part  in  intervention
programmes organised by unions and in most cases by the  provinces  to  have
the results that we had last year. Even up to today there has  been  a  good
deal of evenness in the system.

Regrettably, there have been  ominous  signals  from  the  labour  front  in
recent days. I have no  wish  to  negotiate  from  this  platform:  my  sole
purpose is to inform the public as to what is at stake.  Some  have  already
had their say in the variety of opinion pieces, editorials  and  letters  in
the media, and all have stated the simple truth. This country cannot  afford
a national teachers' strike. This time, not because of  overseas  investors,
the markets or foreign  investment,  but  because  your  children  and  your
neighbour's children will  pay  the  price.  [Interjections.]  Ignorance  is
expensive; too expensive for our children. While there is still a door  open
for talks, we must open it and walk through it together, because we have  to
do it for the sake, not of the national interest, but of our children.

Even if we were to avoid a strike at this last minute - and we  seem  to  be
in the final stages of  an  agreement  -  I  can  assure  members  that  the
uncertainties and anxieties which the  students  are  facing,  will  already
have had an  effect.  The  simple  suggestion  of  a  strike  is  in  itself
destabilising and demotivating, and at precisely the moment when no  learner
can afford such feelings. It would be regrettable if the matric results  are
going to suffer as a result.  Much  more  important,  there  is  a  possible
alienation of our young people from our own  democratic  society.  Thousands
of children will have to repeat a year, or else  be  destined  to  walk  the
streets without a matric, let alone an exemption. And this at  a  time  when
higher education institutions  have  the  capacity  to  take  in  many  more
students.

I must pose a question to all teachers: Is what  they  are  doing  ethically
correct? The SA Council of Educators' Code of Professional Ethics, to  which
all  teachers  subscribe,  has  the  following  to  say   about   registered
educators:


  Firstly, that they acknowledge the noble calling of their  profession  to
  educate and train. Secondly, that they  acknowledge  that  the  attitude,
  dedication, self-discipline, ideals, training and conduct of the teaching
  profession determine the quality of education. Thirdly, that they  commit
  themselves to do all within  their  power  in  the  exercising  of  their
  professional duties, to act  in  accordance  with  the  ideals  of  their
  profession.

These are wonderful sounding words, but somehow in so many  of  the  schools
these remain words. We celebrate the great  work  of  teachers  present  and
past, heroes and heroines in the classroom on this special day, but it  took
long and hard work to inject these ideals into the minds  of  every  teacher
so that they can act them out every day in the classroom. So as  communities
we expect the best of our leaders, of our sports teams, and of our  artists;
and they work hard to ensure we get it. Let us  expect  the  same  from  our
teachers.

Besides celebrating the work of teachers, we  are  also  asked  to  remember
those teachers around the world who are working  under  extreme  conditions.
We do so in  our  best  traditions  of  solidarity.  I  am  drawn  to  think
immediately of women teachers in Afghanistan who have  been  prevented  from
continuing teaching; those in Bosnia who have been raped and  abused;  those
in Rwanda, where teachers are among the first to  be  slaughtered;  and,  of
course, the teachers who have been killed and attacked in  our  own  schools
for whatever reason.

We are seeing a great rise in xenophobia and discrimination and we  look  to
teachers to bring the voice of sanity and hope. Africa is  not  exempt  from
any of these concerns. In many countries  on  this  continent  teachers  are
harassed and victimised for simply doing their jobs. Teachers  are  arrested
when they insist on human rights. We should recall when we  were  like  that
and greatly appreciate the solidarity of the world.

Today teachers in South Africa are creating  their  own  miracles.  Teachers
like those at Mbilwi Secondary School  have  fought  against  adversity  and
poverty to create a model school of which we can all be proud. A small  book
published this year under the title Portraits  of  Courage,  chronicles  the
lives of a few teachers in various parts of the world -  teachers  who  have
overcome adversity, conflict and oppression to do what they have done.  Some
of the recipients of our National Teacher Awards deserve to feature in  such
a book for the moral stand they have taken in education and  the  sacrifices
they have made.

Many have now said that they have turned the corner in education,  and  they
are right. After spending the  first  five  years  building  structures  and
getting a policy framework in place, we are  now  strongly  focused  on  the
quality and delivery of education. Where we used to worry about matric  exam
papers  being  leaked  because  of  poor  management  systems,  we  are  now
concentrating on improving the results and  making  the  matric  examination
more relevant to our needs and those of society.

Systematic evaluation of learner achievements  will  put  the  spotlight  on
performance, so that we can account to the  public,  which  is  entitled  to
receive progress at all levels. In  addition,  a  process  of  whole  school
evaluations will ensure that  schools,  as  organisations,  are  functioning
effectively.  The  people  expect  this  and  we  must  respond   to   their
expectations. These monitoring systems are all part of  the  workings  of  a
modern democratic society and we will not concede that.

Teachers will deliver on this turnaround, I am sure. In so doing  they  will
salvage their noble profession, and not sell it to  the  highest  bidder.  I
can only say that they should think with  their  heads,  as  their  teachers
taught them, and feel with their  hearts,  as  lead  by  example.  But  they
should not confuse today's concerns with their historic mission to  liberate
the nation, especially from ignorance.

As teachers celebrate World Teachers' Day, they  should  remember  how  they
overcame the immense difficulties of the past  and  think  of  the  enormous
challenges  of  the  future,  in  order  to  gain  the   broadest   possible
perspective of their role as teachers.  The  hope  for  the  future  of  our
country lies in these post-apartheid primary and secondary school  teachers,
where even under the worst of conditions concerted efforts  are  being  made
to do the best for our children. In those formerly white or so-called  Model
C schools, the school community as a whole is genuinely  trying  to  grapple
with the challenges of change and in so doing they are contributing  to  the
building of a new national identity.

There will always be deniers; those  who  cannot  come  to  grips  with  the
changes necessary; those who begrudge the progress we are making. The  Irish
have a lovely word, which is  totally  unparliamentary.  It  tells  us  what
should be done with begrudgers like that. But shame on  the  begrudgers  and
forward we will go.

To the teachers of South Africa, we thank and salute you and  on  behalf  of
the nation we say go well. Siyabonga. [Thank you.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister,  before  you  leave  the
podium, will you please introduce the two guests again? Do that so that  the
honourable House may respond in their normal enthusiastic manner.

The MINISTER: Chairperson, they are two representatives of  the  SA  Council
of Educators. But I see that they have gone. I am sorry about that.

Mr R S NTULI: Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon members and fellow  educators,
we welcome and salute you.

The DP wishes to associate itself with  the  sentiments  that  the  hon  the
Minister has expressed. We are solidly behind the words of  advice,  counsel
and caution that he has expressed and his usual stance  of  standing  firmly
for the truth, stating it as it is. We want to thank him for that.

Society cherishes great  expectations  of  teachers,  because  teachers  are
society's  representatives  or  go-betweens.  Teachers  are   intermediaries
between the real world - that is, the factual world - and the ideal world.

The consideration of some of the expectations which teachers face, makes  it
clear what a daunting task they have. Learners, for  example,  expect  their
teachers to relay information and  ideas  effectively;  and  parents  expect
teachers to discipline  their  classes,  instil  moral  values  and  promote
academic excellence. Governments  expect  teachers  to  introduce  to  their
charges  ideas  of  national  unity,  patriotism  and  respect   for   state
institutions.

But while society is all too ready to heap expectations and  obligations  on
the shoulders of teachers, the latter are not generally given  the  material
rewards and social prestige to match the importance of their role in nation-
building. Lest we forget, every gold  medal,  every  doctoral  thesis  at  a
university, every political  leader  in  a  country  big  or  small,  has  a
foundation laid in a classroom.

The inauguration of World Teachers' Day by the International  Conference  on
Education in Geneva in  1995  marks  a  long,  overdue  realisation  of  the
indispensable service teachers render to society.  Since  then  we  annually
celebrate the contribution of teachers to nation-building on 5 October.

The slogan for this year's World Teachers' Day,  chosen  jointly  by  Unesco
and  Education  International,   is   ``Qualified   teachers   for   quality
education''. It encompasses the dual themes  of  teachers  as  indispensable
for providing quality education, and  teachers  as  fundamental  in  helping
governments meet their commitments.

We need also to acknowledge that teaching as a profession implies  that  not
everybody can be a teacher. Related to  this  is  the  critically  important
matter of continuous professional development to maintain a  high  level  of
teacher productivity and efficiency, and to avoid the burnout syndrome.

To improve the quality of education, teachers must  be  supported  in  their
efforts to develop themselves professionally. In  this  regard  we  welcome,
with appreciation,  the  forthcoming  national  teachers'  education  policy
conference organised by  the  Minister  towards  forming  a  new  model  for
teacher development in South Africa.

We believe that the educators who will attend  the  conference  will  emerge
from  the  conference  hall  professionally   wiser   and   with   healthier
professional attitudes, which might include  the  following:  That  teachers
should  acknowledge  and  accept  that  the  attitude,   dedication,   self-
discipline and conduct of  the  teaching  corps  determine  the  quality  of
education in this country  and,  finally,  that  as  teachers,  they  should
commit themselves to do everything within  their  power  to  exercise  their
professional  duties  and  act  in  accordance  with  the  ideals   of   the
profession, as expressed in  the  code  of  conduct  of  the  South  African
council, always  mindful  of  their  fundamental  obligation  to  serve  the
learners. [Applause.]

Prof S  M  MAYATULA:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  the  word
``teacher'' conjures up a number of fond memories.

Let us, for a moment, forget the monsters mistakenly called  teachers,  like
the one who has allegedly raped 22 learners and the one who has  infected  a
learner with HIV/Aids. Our teachers have a great  influence  on  our  lives,
more than any other profession. It is the teaching profession that  made  us
who we are.

Parental guidance in upbringing is important. The family is where the  first
seeds of life are supposed to be planted.  However,  families,  as  we  knew
them,  are  few  and  far  between.  I   am   not   sure   whether   it   is
industrialisation or civilisation that  has  killed  family  life,  but  the
reality is that it is dead. Parents are too busy making  money  or  enjoying
themselves to take care of their children. They do not  even  have  time  to
eat together, let alone pray together.

As soon as a baby is about to be born, one of our concerns is how and  where
to get a nanny. At the age of  two  this  child  is  taken  to  the  nearest
crèche. From that moment on, at that tender age, the  role  of  the  teacher
begins. Surely, teachers are worth celebrating.

I dedicate this speech to my sub A teacher who inculcated in  me  the  habit
of brushing my teeth before I go to bed at night.
Wandixelela ukuba  xa  ndilele  umlomo  awushukumi,  zitsho  iintsholongwane
zifumane ithuba lokubolisa amazinyo zingenasiphazamiso. Wathi  utitshalakazi
ngokuhlamba  amazinyo  phambi  kokuba  ndilale,  ndizivimba  ukutya,  asinde
amazinyo. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[She told me that when I am asleep the mouth does not move, and germs get  a
chance to spoil the teeth without disturbance.  The  teacher  said  that  by
brushing my teeth before I go to sleep, I do  not  give  them  a  chance  to
spoil my teeth so they get rotten.]

I dedicate this speech to all my teachers who inculcated in me the  love  of
education and a better understanding of life.  I  dedicate  this  speech  to
those teachers in the rural areas whose commitment  and  determination  have
not been blunted by the lack of even the basic essentials in their  schools.
They are ready to queue up with their pupils  at  the  nearest  dongas  when
nature calls, owing to the unavailability of toilets.

I dedicate this speech  to  those  teachers  who  conduct  morning  classes,
weekend classes and who even have classes during holidays. They  keep  their
eyes not on their watches, in readiness for the school break,  for  the  end
of the day or the next weekend, but on the task at  hand  of  nurturing  our
nation. To them teaching is a calling, not a career.  They  do  it  for  the
love of it.

They do not need any head of department,  principal  or  inspector  to  prod
them along. They  are  intrinsically  motivated.  They  firmly  believe  and
understand that the future of our children, the future  of  our  nation  and
the future of the world is in their hands. As models to children,  they  can
either build or break their characters.

The implications of a strike by teachers at this time of the  year  for  the
future of thousands of our learners, who are preparing  themselves  for  the
final examination, is to ghastly to contemplate. My  main  concern  here  is
not  the  legitimacy,  or  otherwise,  of  the  strike,   but   the   direct
catastrophic  effects  on  the  learners  who  are  not  involved   in   the
negotiations. It cannot be fair. [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Chairperson, the song that the hon the Minister of  Education
started is a chorus in which all  of  us  can  join.  The  point  that  Prof
Mayatula made, that whoever we are, whatever we are, all of us owe  a  large
measure  of  gratitude  to  those  teachers  who  helped  us.  May  the  new
generation of teachers do more,  and  possibly  much  more,  in  order  that
future generations can also acknowledge the work that teachers do.

Any country, like South Africa, that is celebrating International  Teachers'
Day, and that honours the teachers, actually  empowers  our  children.  When
the nations of the world salute the teacher,  they  knowingly  lays  down  a
deep foundation for a better and more secure future.

Therefore, we in the IFP - with the rest of our colleagues and the  Minister
- say to the teachers in our country and to the educators in the world  that
when they  improve  their  qualifications,  they  help  us  to  improve  our
qualifications. When they take up the challenges of  society,  by  the  same
token  they  reduce  the  challenges  that  we  in  Parliament   and   other
institutions have to take up.

Therefore, the more that the teachers do to ensure that we have an  educated
society, the better the society in which we live. We,  as  politicians,  can
only secure the present and, powerful as we might appear to be,  we  do  not
have the power of the educators and the teachers who secure the future.  The
teacher, as an educator, therefore has  this  enormous  power  to  influence
what the future will look like and therefore  can  make  the  most  powerful
impact on society.

Therefore, we in Parliament are fully supportive of  the  slogan  chosen  by
Education International and  by  Unesco  for  International  Teachers'  Day,
which says: ``Qualified teachers for quality education''. Indeed,  this  has
to be the rallying cry. In a globalised society in which technology  changes
as rapidly as it is adopted,  every  educator  must  seek  continuously  and
continually to improve  his  or  her  qualifications.  The  teacher  has  to
exemplify the ideal of once a learner, always a learner.

If my understanding of the  Botswana  education  policy  is  correct,  every
teacher has to upgrade from one qualification to the  next  in  every  given
period. No teacher may therefore continue to practice in Botswana without  a
new and higher qualification at regular fixed intervals. This  ideal  should
therefore be self-driven by teachers and teacher unions,  and  be  supported
by the state.

In a world that faces dire and daunting challenges, quality education is  an
imperative, and therefore we hope that the  teacher  unions  and  the  state
will be able to resolve the present  impasse  in  order  that  it  does  not
negatively impact on our children. We wish the teachers  the  very  best  on
International Teachers'  Day.  We  hope  that  our  democracy  and  all  the
problems that we have in this country will, through the  efforts  that  they
make, be secured for the future. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I wish to  recognise  the
presence of Mr Gerry Adams from  Ireland  who  is  seated  in  the  gallery.
[Applause.] I wish to welcome him on behalf of Parliament. Enjoy  your  stay
in the country, Mr Adams.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, I fully agree with the previous  speaker.  A
qualified teacher is a prerequisite for quality education in the  classroom.
Thomas Carlyle was once asked what the secret was  of  successful  teaching.
Carlyle replied: ``Be what you would have your pupils be.''

Aan elkeen  van  Suid-Afrika  se  357 532  onderwysers  wat  tot  dusver  'n
voorbeeld was van toewyding, pligsgetrouheid en lojaliteit,  wil  ek  namens
die Nuwe NP hulde bring. Die diens wat hulle aan Suid-Afrika bewys  kan  nie
met geld gekoop word nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[On behalf of the New NP, I wish to pay tribute to each  and  every  one  of
South Africa's 357 532 teachers who up  to  now  have  been  an  example  of
dedication conscientiousness and loyalty. The service they are rendering  to
South Africa cannot be bought with money.]

Allow me to highlight one performance of excellence in  this  regard.  Under
the visionary leadership of Bongi Peyana,  the  Principal  of  Sandi  Senior
Secondary School in the Eastern Cape, the matric pass  rate  increased  from
less than 4% to 93% in just  three  years,  and  that  without  electricity,
telephones and running water. Dedicated teachers made  all  the  difference.
In the light of what happened at the Sandi Senior Secondary School,  a  lack
of resources can no longer serve as an excuse for bad matric results.  There
is no replacement for dedication  in  the  teachers'  profession.  Dedicated
teachers can make South Africa a winning country.

However, a strike on the eve of the final matric  exams  -  which  has  been
referred to by the hon the Minister and Prof Mayatula as  being  planned  by
the SA Democratic Teachers Union - is totally incompatible with  dedication,
and every teacher who is going to  participate  in  this  strike  should  be
excluded from all tributes to the teaching profession today. Those who  plan
this strike and those who are going to participate  in  the  strike  do  not
care for the learners of South Africa.

Yes,  teachers  are  underpaid,  and   the   matter   necessitates   serious
discussion. If we want to draw quality learners to the teaching  profession,
teachers will have to be paid market-related salaries.  Apart  from  ruining
the future  of  innocent  learners  and  causing  the  country  incalculable
damage, a strike on the eve of a final matric  exam  will  not  resolve  the
issue, on-going negotiations are the only answer.

The New NP  urgently  calls  on  Sadtu  to  call  off  the  strike.  We  are
furthermore convinced that  the  time  has  come  to  declare  education  an
essential service, which will make it  impossible  for  teachers  to  go  on
strike. No service can be more essential than that of teaching. [Applause.]

Prof L M MBADI: Mr Chairperson and hon Minister of Education, we would  like
to join you in celebrating World Teachers' Day. All of us in this House  are
a finished product of that noble profession, teaching.  Our  teachers,  dead
or alive, are proud of the members of Parliament of the democratic  Republic
of South Africa.

Today we honour the teachers the world over for their  great  integrity  and
the dignity with which they dedicated their lives to the  total  eradication
of ignorance in their society and in the world.  Teachers  must  acknowledge
the trust and faith the communities have in them all over  the  world.  They
must understand that they are the in loco parentis over their charges.

However, this trust is betrayed by a few rotten apples amongst  them.  These
rogues take advantage  of  the  vulnerability  of  their  charges.  In  some
schools the environment  is  far  from  being  conducive  to  education  and
learning. Shocking incidents of girls being  subjected  to  sexual  violence
and abuse are reported at South African schools.

The Eastern Cape legislature received  a  shocking  and  damning  report  on
horrific details of sexual abuse, rape and exploitation  of  teenage  pupils
at provincial schools. A living example is  a  junior  secondary  school  at
eNgcobo, where the deputy principal allegedly made 20  girls  pregnant.  The
report also cites an HIV-positive teacher at  a  Cradock  school  who  raped
three pupils with the intention of infecting them with the deadly virus.

It is gratifying to note that the Director General of Education is  to  take
action against principals who try to cover up these  misdemeanours.  He  has
promised Parliament that his department will soon unveil  a  programme  that
makes schools safe. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, the ACDP commends all hard-working and  dedicated
teachers on World Teachers' Day. Teachers  are  the  trained  personnel  who
provide a service to meet our society's educational needs.

Theirs is a vocation of great moral imperative and responsibility. The  need
to address the inhospitable system in  which  they  have  to  work  is  long
overdue. Teacher morale in this country has undergone a negative shift  over
the last number of years. Many classrooms no  longer  resemble  a  place  of
learning, but are sites of struggle between learners and the  educator.  The
recent example is the incident in which a  teacher  was  literally  hammered
into subjection by an ill-disciplined  pupil.  The  dutiful  teacher  simply
relied on her own inner resources to survive, as  the  system  within  which
she worked could not protect her.

The present Government has rescinded laws on corporal punishment, yet we  do
not implement an effective alternative policy that either equals or  betters
the repealed law. [Time expired.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson, one head of Government  went  out  to  address
teachers and at the end of his speech he shouted `Long live, teachers!',  to
which they replied with one voice: `On what?'
The Special Intergovernmental Conference on the Status of Teachers  convened
by Unesco and the ILO on 5 October 1966 recommended,  amongst  others,  that
the salaries of teachers should  reflect  the  importance  of  the  teaching
function to society and that  their  salaries  must  compare  favourably  to
other occupations requiring similar qualifications.

It is unfortunate that teachers in this day and age still have to fight  for
the improvement of their salaries to the extent of  going  on  strike,  like
the strike that we currently have on our  hands.  We  call  on  teachers  to
practice extended professionalism that goes beyond performing  as  and  when
the school bell rings only, but goes right into  the  community  around  the
school they teach at. We believe that for teachers to  operate  well,  there
should be a mutual relationship of trust, respect and  co-operation  amongst
themselves, pupils and the community at large.

Finally, we salute those men and women in  the  noble  profession  who  have
survived depression and held  their  heads  high,  even  under  such  trying
circumstances.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, we celebrate this  day  with  teachers,  parents
and pupils of the world. The PAC salutes the teachers of this nation in  the
first place, because teachers are nation builders  and  world  shapers.  Few
adults spend the same length of time with the young of  the  nation  between
the ages of five and 25, as teachers do.

Teachers influence the cream of our nation for good or for bad.  The  saying
bears repeating that whereas the blunders of the doctors lie in  the  grave,
and those of the lawyers in prison, those of the teachers roam the  streets.
There was a sad story this week  of  a  13-year-old  pupil  who  chased  and
assaulted a teacher with a hammer and the teacher  landed  up  in  hospital.
There were other stories of teachers who were arrested and tried  for  moral
offences.

On the positive side, many teachers have produced doctors, judges,  priests,
politicians and statesmen of note. Teachers cannot  escape  the  results  or
fruits of their work. They are  respected  for  their  beliefs,  values  and
dedication. Even as the world is on the brink of a  catastrophic  war,  some
teachers somewhere who taught Osama Bin Laden, George W Bush or Tony  Blair,
to name but a few, must be knowing that they have a share in the destiny  of
the world. God bless the teachers of South Africa,  Africa  and  the  entire
global village. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, the teacher  in  me
would demand that you concentrate a little harder.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson and the Minister of  Education,  the  MF  takes
this opportunity to applaud teachers around the globe in  their  mission  to
accomplish the provision of education to all. When  a  child  is  born,  its
primary socialisation  is  carefully  and  knowledgeably  instilled  by  the
parent or guardian. From here the task of moulding the soul is passed on  to
the education institutions, where teachers of our nation  not  only  educate
according to the curriculum, but strive to  inculcate  values  that  are  to
produce persons of  high  standards  to  continue  the  advancement  of  our
nation. From generation to generation, be it school,  nursery,  college,  or
religious institution, the objective is to educate.

The MF applauds the sacrifice, as well  as  the  efforts,  of  all  teachers
that, most certainly, serve as a tool to  instil  education.  May  this  day
highlight the efforts of  teachers,  especially  those  from  the  apartheid
regime, who had to accomplish educating children with  minimal  and  limited
resources. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chaiperson, may I take this opportunity to salute all  teachers
of South Africa, all members of this very noble  profession.  Up  to  today,
apart from my parents, I have a few role models in life.  They  are  neither
celebrities nor sport heroes or even dominees, but a few of my  teachers.  I
agree with the hon Minister that a striking educator is  a  contradictio  in
terminus.

I want to use this opportunity to make an appeal, especially  to  Afrikaans-
speaking South Africans, to consider a career in teaching. Enrolment of  new
Afrikaans-speaking students is less than 25%  of  the  figure  necessary  to
fill expected vacancies. I can guarantee hon members that it  is  not  Kader
Asmal who is the greatest danger for education in our own  language,  as  we
believe. It is the lack of Afrikaans-speakers studying education.

There is hardly a job that has more job security than teaching. And  I  want
to conclude by proving that I put my money where my mouth  is.  My  youngest
son completed his studies as  a  teacher  this  year  and  already  has  his
appointment for next year. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! To all the hon members who  had
just one minute, I want to remind you that Vodacom and MTN are now  charging
by the second, so Parliament is still doing well, allowing you a minute.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, hon members, dear colleagues. I  did
not know so many of the hon members would stay to the  end  of  the  debate.
So, to compliment them, may I refer to three or four serious points?

First of all, I would like to say that it is a great honour for us  to  have
had - and I think we are one of a few Parliaments in the world to have  such
a motion, a motion - on World Teachers' Day, and it is  a  credit  to  South
Africa. Secondly, let me thank those who have taken  great  pains  to  speak
and draw attention  to  the  contribution  that  teachers  have  made.  Prof
Mayatula  talked  about  his  wonderful  teachers  and  their  extraordinary
impact.

I want to say something about how South Africa has  radically  changed  from
the time I was at school. My teachers were all unqualified,  and  they  were
no good. They could not teach and they were in fear of this  inspector  -  a
kind of feudal man who would come once in a while and open the door.

We are talking about change in South  Africa.  The  change  that  has  taken
place has been such that we have  opened  up  our  school  system.  We  have
opened up a school system with a post-apartheid generation of youngsters  in
primary schools. One really has to go to different parts of South Africa  to
see the sense of excitement in schools  today.  One  gets  it  quietly,  the
detritus and the sensational newspaper headlines. But one should  go  around
the schools and see how, out of very little, they are able to  do  so  much.
[Interjections.] Yes, we have.

Thirdly, I want to say that the improvement in teachers' qualifications  has
to take place and it has to be over a long period.  We  cannot  pay  market-
related salaries. I do not know what market-related salaries  are.  Teachers
earn  more  than  anybody  else  on  a  similar  level  of   qualifications.
[Interjections.] They earn more on a similar level of  qualifications.  What
we therefore want to take into  account  is  training.  Next  year  tens  of
thousands of teachers will be going for training at a cost of R100  million.
The money comes from the Education Labour Relations Council.
We have enormous competing interests in South  Africa.  Education  gets  R51
billion - 21% of the national Budget. Fourthly, what we have to work out  is
how  well  we  are  using  it.  Part  of  this  amount  is,  in  fact,   for
deracialising our education system. We still have  two  educational  systems
in South Africa. We have two sets of teachers.

I became a teacher because  my  family  could  not  afford  to  send  me  to
university. For many teachers, teaching is a second  choice.  My  job  as  a
Minister of Education is to inspire young people, such as Cassie's  son,  to
choose teaching  as  a  first  choice  profession.  So  we  are  now  making
available nearly R13 million out of the national financial aid scheme.  That
is very innovative. It is reserved for those who want  to  become  teachers.
If the demand is great this year, we will  increase  it.  Out  of  the  R600
million that we have, we will make it about R45 million. I make this  appeal
that teaching should become the first choice.

Corporal punishment is not attractive to the young people. You  cannot  beat
people to make them friendly, lively, or  to  make  them  work.  We  have  a
booklet which is going out to  the  country,  which  is  an  alternative  to
corporal  punishment.  Members  of  Parliament  should  not  say  that   the
Government let them down because we abolished corporal punishment.

The  Constitutional  Court  formed  up  the  appellation  and  in  the  most
civilised countries we think that it is an English disease,  for  those  who
inflict the punishment often get more pleasure than the  pain  that  accrues
to that poor little blighter. We have to take  this  into  account  that  to
build civilisation, we cannot do so through violence.

Can I also add that no one spoke  about  the  stature  of  teachers?  Thirty
years ago there was a romantic view that teachers had a  wonderful  stature.
It is a romantic view. We must improve the stature of teachers. We  have  to
do that, because we are putting our most vulnerable and tender  people  into
their hands.

We must not bash the unions. Union bashing will not get  us  anywhere.  They
have a constitutional right to strike. We have given thought to  whether  we
can make them an essential service. The ILO says one cannot  do  it,  and  I
agree with that. It is a question of timing.

All of us who have been in that profession noticed  that  at  certain  times
one never used one's power and strength, because the effect  would  be,  not
on the Government, not on members of  Parliament,  but,  of  course  on  the
children. That is why we must engage with  our  union  friends,  as  we  did
today. To engage with  them,  to  talk  to  them  and  then  to  work  on  a
satisfactory solution, which is what, in fact, a teacher's day is all  about
- now we can have a proper engagement about what I still consider to be  the
most noble profession of them all. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  earlier  this
afternoon a motion on the subject was adopted and that will be given  effect
too.

Order! The hon Dr Geldenhuys is in a great hurry but  I  just  have  another
few seconds if he will bear with the House.

Debate concluded.

6.    Third Report of the Standing Committee on Public  Accounts,  dated  12
     September 2001:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having heard and  considered
     evidence on  the  Reports  of  the  Auditor-General  on  the  financial
     statements of Vote 29 - Government Communication and Information System
     (formerly the South African Communication Service) for the  year  ended
     31 March 1999 [RP 139-99],  the  financial  statements  of  Vote  14  -
     Government Communication and Information System  (GCIS)  for  the  year
     ended 31 March 2000 [RP 123-2000] and certain papers  referred  to  it,
     reports as follows:


     A.     Financial management
         The Committee noted that the GCIS was established in May 1998 as  a
         result of a decision  taken  by  Cabinet  that  the  South  African
         Communication Service  needed  to  be  restructured  and  that  the
         Auditor-General's report for  the  1998-99  financial  year  mainly
         dealt with a period during which the Department was in the  process
         of restructuring. The Committee was left with an impression  of  an
         accounting officer that is serious about his duties as  steward  of
         public funds and the concommittant accountability to  Parliament  -
         also that he has  surrounded  himself  with  senior  staff  members
         equally serious about effective financial management.


         The Committee wishes to report on the following matters dealt  with
         during the hearings:


         1. Budgeting and planning


              The Committee noted the agreement reached  with  the  National
              Treasury regarding the Department's budget which, in terms  of
              the MTEF, will be increased by approximately 8 to 10% per year
              until 2003, at which point an appropriate base-line for future
              budgeting  processes  will  be  reached.   The  Committee   is
              encouraged  by  the  corrective  measures  introduced  by  the
              Accounting  Officer,  and  welcomes  his  assurance  that  the
              Department's resources will be properly managed.


              This is especially welcomed,  given  the  Committee's  concern
              regarding the extent of the unspent funds during  the  1998-99
              financial year, which amounted to 19,2% of  the  total  budget
              allocated.


              The Committee  nevertheless  recommends  that  the  Accounting
              Officer ensure that:


              (a)  effective  monitoring  of  the  Department's  expenditure
                  against budget be  carried  out  in  respect  of  all  its
                  programmes  and  subprogrammes  in  compliance  with  PFMA
                  regulations, and that, where necessary, corrective  action
                  be taken immediately; and
              (b) the Department  apply  proper  principles  of  performance
                  budgeting as required in terms of the strategic plan.


         2. Audit Committee and internal audit


              The Committee was informed that  the  appointment  of  persons
              from outside the Department has been finalised, and  that  the
              internal  audit  section  has  been   functioning   relatively
              effectively in terms of an approved charter. The Committee  is
              also satisfied with  the  report  presented  to  them  by  the
              Chairperson of the Audit Committee.


              The Committee, however,  requests  a  progress  report  to  be
              submitted  by  31  October  2001,  containing  the   following
              information:


              (a) Whether the internal audit  component  complies  with  the
                  requirements of section 76(4)(e)  of  the  Public  Finance
                  Management Act and Treasury Regulation 3.2.


              (b) Whether the composition of the Audit Committee adheres  to
                  the criteria as set  out  in  section  77  of  the  Public
                  Finance Management Act and Treasury Regulation 3.1.


     B.     Unauthorised expenditure


         The  Committee  took  note  of  three  instances  of   unauthorised
         expenditure, totalling R3 997 167,84.


         1. Noting that R3  738  148,79  relates  to  over-expenditure,  the
              Committee expressed its concern. As  the  expenditure  charged
              against the Vote exceeded the total amount  voted  by  R3  738
              148,79, this amount is regarded as unauthorised  in  terms  of
              section 33(1)(b)(i) of the  Exchequer  Act,  1975.  A  further
              amount of R58 889,05 is also regarded as unauthorised in terms
              of section 33(1)(c) of the Exchequer Act, 1975, since the GCIS
              did not obtain prior Treasury approval to utilise a saving  on
              personnel  expenditure   for   other   purposes.   Given   the
              circumstances at the time, as well  as  the  comments  of  the
              National Treasury and the corrective measures  implemented  by
              the Department, the Committee recommends that these amounts be
              authorised by Parliament.


         2. A further  amount  of  R200  130  is  regarded  as  unauthorised
              expenditure in terms of section 33(1)(d) of the Exchequer Act,
              1975. The GCIS did not comply with  Tender  Board  procurement
              procedures  in  that  they  placed  an  order  before  written
              approval had been granted by the State Tender Board, due to  a
              misunderstanding between the two. As the contravention was  of
              a technical nature, the  services  were  rendered,  the  State
              suffered no loss and the Auditor-General  has  indicated  that
              the expenditure can be authorised legally  without  detracting
              from effective financial  control,  the  Committee  recommends
              that the amount be authorised by Parliament.


     C.     Asset management


         The Auditor-General has once  more  reported  shortcomings  in  the
         control over fixed assets. The  Accounting  Officer  also  reported
         problems being experienced with the LOGIS asset management system.


         While noting the Accounting Officer's prudent  approach  by  having
         regular  reconciliation  of  fixed  assets  with  the  fixed  asset
         register, the  Committee  is  concerned  that  the  Department  has
         requested approval  from  the  Treasury  for  the  so-called  "red-
         lining" of the asset register in order to proceed  with  verifiable
         starting balances in the register.


         Although the Committee accepts that the Department  does  not  have
         any alternative if it  wants  asset  management  to  proceed  in  a
         proper manner from  this  point  onwards,  it  is  concerned  about
         assets that may have been lost in the process.


         The Committee is also concerned about the reported inadequacies  of
         public  sector  asset  management  within  the  current  cash-basis
         accounting system. The Committee also took note of the concerns  by
         the National Treasury that the "red-lining"  approvals  were  still
         done in terms of the old Exchequer Act.  Since  the  implementation
         of the Public Finance Management Act,  the  responsibility,  should
         there be any deficits or surplus stock, lies  with  the  Accounting
         Officer.


         The Committee therefore recommends that -
         1. the Accounting Officer persist  with  his  prudent  approach  of
              regular physical reconciliation of the Department's  bar-coded
              fixed assets with the fixed asset register;


         2. the Department fully comply with the  various  elements  of  new
              Treasury Regulation 10, relating to asset management;


         3. the Treasury comment by  31  October  2001  on  the  transversal
              nature of the deficiencies regarding asset  management  within
              the  cash-based  accounting  environment,   and   specifically
              indicate what aspects departments should concentrate on  until
              such time as better asset management will be  possible  within
              the accrual accounting environment;


         4. regarding the newly established government information  centres,
              the Accounting Officer  report  by  31  October  2001  on  the
              arrangements  made  to  ensure  that  responsibility  for  the
              maintenance and  safeguarding  of  all  equipment  is  clearly
              fixed; and


         5. the Department supply the Committee and the Portfolio  Committee
              on Communications with a cost-benefit  exercise  according  to
              which  these   government   information   centres   had   been
              established.


     D.     Public Finance Management Act


         The  Committee  took  note  of  the  steps  already  taken  by  the
         Accounting Officer in aligning  the  Department's  operations  with
         the requirements of the PFMA, and  that  further  training  of  key
         personnel is planned. The Committee recommends that the  Accounting
         Officer, in  consultation  with  the  National  Treasury  and  with
         reference to the formalised  IPFA  accreditation,  ensure  that  an
         appropriately accredited PFMA training intervention is  implemented
         within the Department.


     E.     Government's mid-term report


         1. Unauthorised expenditure


              Unauthorised expenditure to the  amount  of  R2  918  400  was
              incurred by the former accounting officer with the printing of
              the mid-term report. Since the Committee  recommended  in  its
              Twelfth Report of 1999 to  Parliament  that  the  unauthorised
              expenditure of R2 918 400 not be authorised by Parliament, the
              case has been referred  to  the  State  Attorney.  A  combined
              summons to the amount of R1 698 400  (the  difference  between
              the actual amount paid and the  quotation  of  the  Government
              Printing Works), plus interest  calculated  from  26  February
              1997 at a rate of 15,5% per annum, as well as costs  of  suit,
              were issued to the former accounting officer and the  affected
              company on 19 April 2000. On 27 March 2001  the  Registrar  of
              the Court handed down a judgement for the amount of R1 698 400
              against the former accounting officer, which is valid  for  30
              years.
              The Committee therefore recommends that the balance of R1  220
              000 of the total unauthorised  expenditure  be  authorised  by
              Parliament, as the Department obtained value despite the  fact
              that the tender procedures had not been followed.


         2. Recovery of unauthorised expenditure not authorised


              The Committee furthermore noted the follow-up that was done by
              the Department  to  secure  a  judgement  in  this  case.  The
              Committee recommends that it be kept updated on  the  progress
              made to give effect to the judgement  on  a  bi-annual  basis,
              commencing 1 November 2001.

7.    Fourth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  dated  19
     September 2001:
     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having heard and  considered
     evidence  on  the  Report  of  the  Auditor-General  on  the  financial
     statements of the Truth and  Reconciliation  Commission  for  the  year
     ended 31 March 1999 [RP 38-2000], reports as follows:


     1.     Non-compliance with procurement regulations (Par 2.2.2, page 2)


         The  Committee  has   gathered   detailed   information   regarding
         procurement practices employed during the earlier life of the  TRC.
         This lead the Committee to conclude as follows:


         The Committee is dissatisfied about the manner in which the  matter
         was dealt with by the TRC as well as by  the  State  Tender  Board.
         The TRC argues  that  urgency  and  procedural  uncertainty,  inter
         alia,  contributed  to  the  TRC  not  complying  with   applicable
         procurement regulations, while the Tender Board provided  incorrect
         advice to the TRC. However, while the Committee is aware  that  the
         deciding interpretation  of  the  applicable  legislation  requires
         that State Tender Board approval be obtained  for  major  purchases
         or payments, the following relevant facts were also noted:


         (a)     The TRC's strong identity as a  body  autonomous  from  the
              government.


         (b)     The urgency with which the TRC and its  infrastructure  had
              to be established and its initial short life expectancy.


         (c)     The anticipated life  term  of  the  TRC  was  a  temporary
              situation that lasted for the first  four  to  six  months  of
              operations. Once the permanent  CEO  was  appointed,  adequate
              guidelines and procedures were adopted.


         (d)     There were bona fide attempts by the TRC to  ascertain  the
              correct legal position in view  of  a  number  of  conflicting
              legal opinions, as well as direction  from  the  State  Tender
              Board contrary to the final legal opinion.


         (e)     The assurance by the  CEO  that  no  monies  were  lost  or
              misused.


         In view of the above, and the other information  considered,  which
         indicated  that  value  was  received  for  the  money  spent,  the
         Committee recommends that the purchases and  payments  reported  as
         unauthorised be validated by Parliament.


         However, the Committee is perturbed that bodies such  as  the  TRC,
         established with substantial independence from the government,  are
         often established within  a  vacuum  with  respect  to  a  detailed
         financial control environment, including procurement,  fixed  asset
         management, the use of  corporate  credit  cards  and  compensation
         matters.


         The Committee is aware  of  section  38(1)(m)  of  the  PFMA,  that
         requires accounting officers  to  promptly  consult  and  seek  the
         prior written consent of the National Treasury on  any  new  entity
         that  a  department  or  constitutional  institution   intends   to
         establish.


         The Committee recommends that the  National  Treasury  ensure  that
         when it considers  such  requests  for  consent,  all  elements  of
         proper   financial   management   and   corporate   governance   be
         considered, including the establishment of proper  control  systems
         from the beginning of the life  of  the  new  entity,  as  well  as
         financial management capacity in  terms  of  staffing,  skills  and
         information systems.


     2.     Transfer of assets (Par 3.7(a), page 5)


         The Promotion of National Unity  and  Reconciliation  Act  requires
         the assets of the TRC  to  be  transferred  to  the  Department  of
         Justice.


         As most of the business of  the  TRC  have  been  wound  down,  the
         Committee  recommends  that  the  CEO  obtain  a   certificate   of
         acknowledgement from the Director-General: Justice that all  assets
         transferred so far had been received and had  been  placed  on  the
         asset register of the Department, including the  valuable  database
         and all related documentation, as well as any  information  of  the
         TRC.


         In addition, with regard to  assets  still  to  be  transferred,  a
         similar process should be followed, and the  CEO,  as  one  of  his
         last actions, should confirm to the Committee as soon  as  possible
         that a certificate of receipt for all  remaining  assets  had  been
         received from the Director-General: Justice.


         In both instances, the certificates must be made available  to  the
         Auditor-General as soon as they become available.


         The Committee also recommends that the Accounting Officer  transfer
         all valuable data of the TRC and  other  intellectual  property  to
         the Department of Justice.

         the deciduous fruit industry, reports, in terms of  section  15  of
         the Marketing of Agricultural  Products  Act,  1996,  that  it  has
