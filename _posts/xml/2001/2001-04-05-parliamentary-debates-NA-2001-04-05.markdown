                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr J S MGIDI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the opening of the annual conference of the SA Local Government
       Association (Salga) by the President of the Republic, the hon Thabo
       Mbeki, in Bloemfontein today;


  (2) further notes that the focus of the deliberations in this conference
       will be the provision of free services to poor communities;


  (3) believes that this is a significant conference as it will give
       direction on how to mobilise civil society to participate in
       municipal affairs as required by the law; and


  (4) wishes Salga good luck in its deliberations.

[Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House appoints an ad hoc committee representative of all parties
  in order to


       (1)  investigate whether the Minister of Health, the hon Dr M
           Tshabalala-Msimang, misled the House in respect of offers made
           to her department by pharmaceutical companies with regard to
           assistance, support and the provision of drugs for the treatment
           of HIV/Aids patients, rape survivors and to prevent mother-to-
           child transmission; and


       (b)  determine what steps should be taken by the House in relation to
           the conduct of the Minister.

[Interjections.]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the SANDF personnel selected to serve under the UN
       Peace-keeping Force in the DRC;


  (2) exhorts these members to uphold the dignity and respect of the South
       African people and the Government by way of astute behaviour and
       carrying out their duty with honour; and


  (3) will earnestly pray for them and always wish them well on their
       carrying out of international duty deservedly bestowed on them as
       loyal soldiers of this country.

Miss J E SOSIBO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that for the sixth year running, the SA Revenue Service has
       exceeded its tax collection target, this year by R4,2 billion;


  (2) recognises that the budget deficit for the past fiscal year has come
       in at below 2% of GDP, which is better than many developed countries;


  (3) acknowledges the beneficial effect that this sound financial
       management will have on our economy; and
  (4) commends the Minister of Finance, the Department of Finance and the
       SA Revenue Service for their continued sound management of the South
       African fiscus.

[Applause.]

Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the release of the long-awaited report of President Thabo
           Mbeki's controversial Aids Advisory Panel which, as predicted by
           the DA for months now, has produced no concrete results to help
           millions of Aids sufferers in South Africa; and


       (b)  with shock that by the Government's own admission, the report
           has no effect on the current Aids policy, and thereby confirms
           the fact that this multimillion rand exercise was put in place
           only to satisfy the intellectual curiosity of our President who
           is now left with even more questions than answers;


  (2) acknowledges that the report confirms the ANC's contradictory stance
       on the use of antiretrovirals, which differentiates itself from the
       DA's policy in which we support antiretroviral use; and


  (3) calls on the Government to stop using the report as a cover-up for
       their feeble fight against the scourge of HIV/Aids.

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House, on the eve of the Easter weekend -


  (1) appeals to all road users during the long weekend to be alert at all
       times, refrain from drinking and driving, keep to the speed limits
       and look out for the potential mistakes of other road users;
  (2) expresses its good wishes to all law enforcement officials who will
       be tasked with enforcing the law on our roads;


  (3) expresses its hope that the ``Arrive Alive'' Campaign will be
       effectively implemented this year and wishes the Minister of
       Transport and his department, and all provinces, good luck in their
       efforts; and


  (4) calls on all South Africans to ensure that serious accidents and
       deaths on our roads in the coming days are kept to a minimum, in the
       hope that we can establish a new record for the fewest deaths during
       this time of celebration and rest.

[Applause.]

Ms M M MAUNYE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -
       (a)  the DA's so-called chief ``spin doctor'', Ryan Coetzee, has
           accused the media of running a campaign against him;


       (b)  the DA has always accused the ANC of intolerance of press
           freedom; and


       (c)  the DA is known for its loud and misleading sound-bites and for
           developing policies for the privileged, and not the poor;


  (2) reminds Coetzee that -


       (a)  he is paid R420 000 a year for his immature managing of the DA's
           media liaison; and


       (b)  he has single-handedly started and intensified the new Anglo-
           Boer War in the DA caucus; and


  (3) calls on him as a media manager to improve his relations with the
       press and stop his characteristic childish moaning and complaining.

[Applause.]
Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with appreciation the letter of rebuke written by Dr Allan
           Boesak to Prof Kader Asmal, who unfairly and unjustifiably
           attacked the Christians who gathered at Newlands Stadium to pray
           for peace, security and transformation in this country;


       (b)  with great interest that Dr Boesak believes that there is no
           area of life that is not subject to the lordship of Jesus
           Christ;


       (c)  that he says his own participation in the struggle for
           liberation in this country was based on and inspired by his
           faith in Jesus Christ and not Marx or Lenin; and


       (d)  he correctly says that more than anything, our struggle was
           sustained by prayer and faith;
  (2) endorses the observation he made that history is littered with the
       debris of once powerful regimes who thought they could take on God
       and the Church; and


  (3) encourages Dr Boesak to remain strong in the Lord and to continue
       confronting and correcting his comrades whenever necessary.

[Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die AEB sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem van minister Steve Tshwete se beroep op georganiseerde
       landbou om eendragtig op te tree ten opsigte van plaasmoorde;


  (2) die aandag van die Minister daarop vestig dat Agri SA, die TLU en die
       LWO wel saamwerk in die oorkoepelende Aksie Stop Plaasaanvalle,
       gerugsteun deur 390 000 petisionarisse;


  (3) die Minister versoek om ten opsigte van plaasmoorde met hierdie
       oorkoepelende Aksie te onderhandel eerder as met afsonderlike
       organisasies;


  (4) 'n beroep doen op die onderskeie landbou-organisasies om in goeie
       onderlinge trou die ooreenkoms wat hulle onderling aangegaan het
       deurgaans te eerbiedig en uit een mond met die Regering en enige
       ander belanghebbendes te onderhandel, en nie toe te laat dat eie
       agendas en die onderlinge verskille wat daar tussen organisasies
       bestaan die veiligheid van ons boere benadeel nie; en


  (5) 'n beroep op die landbou-organisasies doen om ook op plaaslike vlak
       te koördineer en uit een form met belanghebbendes saam te werk om die
       lewens van ons boere te beskerm.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the AEB:


  That the House -


  (1) notes Minister Steve Tshwete's appeal to organised agriculture to act
       in unison in respect of farm murders;


  (2) wishes to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that Agri SA, the
       TAU and the LWO are, in fact, working together in the umbrella
       organisation ``Aksie Stop Plaasaanvalle'', backed by 390 000
       petitioners;


  (3) requests the Minister, in respect of farm murders, rather to
       negotiate with this umbrella organisation than with separate ones;


  (4) appeals to the various agricultural organisations to respect
       throughout, mutually and in good faith, the understanding into which
       they have entered and to negotiate through one mouth when dealing
       with the Government and any other interested parties, and not to
       allow hidden agendas and mutual differences that exist between
       organisations to prejudice the safety of our farmers; and


  (5) appeals to the agricultural organisations also to co-ordinate at
       local level and to co-operate from one forum with interested parties
       in order to protect the lives of our farmers.]

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Cape Town Mayor, Mr Peter Marais, claimed at his
           inauguration that ``Coloured people had to wait 350 years to
           become mayors''; and


       (b)  everyone knows that the ANC's Theresa Solomons was the first
           coloured, and after her, NomaIndia Mfeketho was the first
           African mayor of Cape Town;


  (2) reminds Mr Marais that the ANC had, with the nomination of two black
       mayors, broken with the DA tradition of appointing only white mayors;
       and


  (3) calls on Mr Marais to -


       (a)  prove his loyalty to the cause of transformation by reversing
           the ban on soccer at Newlands; and


       (b)  stop his insensitive posturing that divides rather than unites
           the people of Cape Town.

[Applause.]

Mr V C GORE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note of the utter and devastating chaos in the ANC-controlled
       Johannesburg City Council;


  (2) expresses its shock and outrage that this city was left without
       resources, including no petrol for lawnmowers, no bulbs to replace
       fused streetlights, no paint to paint road lines, a chronic shortage
       of bus drivers and, in a certain department, no telephones as the
       account was not paid;
  (3) further notes that the National Treasury has refused to pay the
       second instalment of a R500 million loan to bail out the ANC-
       controlled Johannesburg City Council, citing as the reason that
       Johannesburg remains in a deep financial crisis; and


  (4) calls on the ANC-controlled City Council of Johannesburg to follow
       the example of the DA-controlled Unicity of Cape Town in governing
       and delivering to all the people rather than to a selected and
       privileged few in the ANC.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) applauds the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism for
       contemplating a tender for new vessels to patrol the country's
       fishery resources in our Exclusive Economic Zone;
  (2) believes that this move will protect the living marine resources from
       illegal fishing activities, especially the Patagonian toothfish
       desperately sought by illegal fishers for its market, whilst it can
       only breed after it is about ten years old; and


  (3) pleads with the department to speed up the tendering process before
       this living marine resource is depleted.

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the
next sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  corporal punishment as a method of disciplining learners has
           been declared illegal; and


       (b)  a pupil in the Northern Province lost an eye after being
           assaulted by her teacher;


  (2) expresses outrage and condemns the prevalence of this barbaric
       action; and


  (3) calls on parents, teachers, learners, school managers and provincial
       authorities to take on the challenge of transforming all schools into
       secure and safe places of learning for the sake of the future leaders
       of our country.

[Applause.]

Adv A H GAUM: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the new Johannesburg Metro Police Department was launched
       last Friday, but that -


       (a)  in fact, Johannesburg's ``1 000 strong crime-busting force''
           consists of 741 former traffic officers in new uniforms and
           repainted vehicles with an even bigger workload; and


       (b)  the Premier has unambiguously stated that the Johannesburg Metro
           Police Department would receive no assistance from the province,
           despite the rampant occurrence of violent crimes;


  (2) further notes that the DA-governed Western Cape has allocated R36,8
       million to crime prevention throughout the province and that R20,9
       million has been set aside to purchase the Philippi training complex
       to train up to 1 000 municipal police officers at a time; and


  (3) calls on the Gauteng government not to place the full burden of
       establishing Metro Police on the ratepayers' shoulders, but to make
       the much-needed provincial funding available.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr D G MKONO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -
  (1) expresses its alarm at the latest statistics on conditions in SA
       prisons;


  (2) notes especially the dramatic increase in natural deaths, 584% over
       the past five years, mostly as a result of HIV/Aids;


  (3) further notes that it is predicted that the current death rate would
       result in 45 000 prisoners dying per year by 2010;


  (4) acknowledges that the rate of natural deaths in prisons is directly
       related to the appalling conditions, with overcrowding and rape being
       the norm, currently existing in SA prisons, which are exacerbating
       criminality rather than serving as rehabilitation, and which explain
       the high number of habitual criminals; and


  (5) calls on the Minister of Correctional Services to address immediately
       both the conditions in prisons and the unacceptable lack of a
       concerted HIV/Aids strategy.

[Applause.]

Mr S K LOUW: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) the procurement workshop was held as a follow-up to the signing of
       the Liquid Fuels Charter;


  (2) the Liquid Fuels Charter states that 25% of stakes shall be reserved
       for Black Economic Empowerment ;


  (3) the procurement workshop was attended by well over 400 people, 30% of
       whom were women from all provinces, with limited background knowledge
       of the industry, but with an interest in providing a procurement
       service to the oil industry; and


  (4) the workshop was a resounding success in taking forward facilitation
       and networking on procurement in the oil industry.

     TENSION BETWEEN CHINA AND THE USA, AND CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the recent tension between China and the United States of
           America over spy planes; and


       (b)  the continuing crisis in the Middle East and the devastating
           effect it has on women and children;


  (2) believes that the recent international tensions will reverse all
       gains that have been made in maintaining global peace;


  (3) calls upon the conflicting parties in all trouble spots to work for
       the peaceful resolution of their conflicts; and


  (4) calls upon the United Nations and all other relevant bodies and
       governments to work tirelessly for the peaceful resolution of all
       conflicts in the world.

Agreed to.

        GOOD WISHES TO CHRISTIANS FOR EASTER AND TO JEWS FOR PASSOVER

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that Christians in South Africa and all over the world will be
           observing Easter next weekend; and


       (b)  that the Jewish community will be celebrating Passover; and


  (2) wishes these religious communities and all South Africans well over
       the Easter period and prays that they and all members of Parliament
       will have a safe journey to their different holiday destinations.

Agreed to.

                     KLEIN KAROO NATIONAL ARTS FESTIVAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr C H F GREYLING: Mevrou die Speaker, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  dat die Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees, een van die
           hoogtepunte op die jaarlikse kalender, weer die naweek 'n
           aanvang neem; en
       (b)  dat die plaaslike kunstenaars wat by die fees optree jaarliks
           geweldige steun van die publiek kry en dat 'n hele paar van die
           vertonings by die fees reeds uitverkoop is; en


  (2) 'n beroep op sy lede doen om hierdie kleurryke fees te ondersteun.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr C H F Greyling: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Klein Karoo National Arts Festival, one of the highlights on
           the yearly calendar, is commencing this weekend; and


       (b)  local artists who perform at the festival annually get a lot of
           support from the public and quite a number of the shows at the
           festival are already sold out; and


  (2) calls on its members to support this colourful festival.]

                            PERSONAL EXPLANATION

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, Mr Abrah has requested an opportunity to
give a personal explanation, and I will now give him that opportunity.

Mr S ABRAH: Madam Speaker, at the conclusion of the debate on violence in
the rural areas, I was on my way to my seat here, when the hon Donald Lee
provoked me. And may I assure this House that at no stage did I refer to
the hon Mr Lee as a bobbejaanspanner - I have far too much respect for a
bobbejaanspanner. [Laughter.] The hon Mr Lee ...

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: This hon member is
abusing the opportunity which he requested, and I ask you to rule
accordingly. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon Mr Abrah, you will confine yourself strictly to the
point that you asked leave to address, and not to what you might have done
or might have wanted to do.

Mr S ABRAH: Madam Speaker, on my way I was provoked, and the subject of the
provocation was that the hon Mr Botha had made a far better speech in the
House. I used the words: ``Hy het gepraat.'' In the first place, I believe
that whatever happens here in the benches is something that should not be
taken up with the hon Speaker who has far more onerous duties.

But that was in the course of an ordinary exchange between members. The
word that I used is one which I believe is utilised in Afrikaans, but since
it is a word that has apparently offended the hon Mr Botha, I will withdraw
the word and say ...

... sy toespraak was onsin, want ek moet my sterkste afkeur daaroor
uitspreek. [Applous.] [... his speech was absurd, because I have to express
my disapproval of it in the strongest possible terms. [Applause.]]

Mr A J BOTHA: Madam Speaker, may I have an opportunity, on a point of
order, to reply, since ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order, hon members! You may raise a point of order, but there
is no opportunity to reply. I was going to comment, but you may raise a
point of order if you have one.

Mr A J BOTHA: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I believe that the hon
Abrah has not apologised for his despicable behaviour.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I want to state that I allowed Mr Abrah to
make this statement, because I had in fact asked Mr Botha, who had raised a
point of order during the debate, to respond.

It is correct that normally the Chair is not involved in debates that you
have amongst yourselves - and which you are not supposed to have, I might
point out. But, certainly, I would expect that both officially and
unofficially members treat each other with courtesy and respect.

I have previously said that we should respect our integrity, not only by
calling each other ``hon members''. And, therefore, I asked Mr Abrah to
come and see me. He said he was going to withdraw the statement he had
made, that he had not meant what that statement implied. That was the only
basis on which he was allowed to speak.

The point raised by Mr Gibson, on a point of order, was taken and I think
that subsequently he abided by it. The matter is now closed, but I do want
to appeal to you even in private, not to be provocative or offensive to one
another. But it is your judgment as to how you behave.

                          UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE

                                  (Ruling)

The SPEAKER: Order! I now wish to give a ruling on another matter that
arose around the same time. In the course of that debate, a point of order
was raised concerning a statement by the hon Mr Botha, and I quote:


  ... the ANC, with the President's Office in the lead, encourage all and
  sundry to hate white farmers on account of their alleged racist
  misdemeanours.

The question was whether it was parliamentary to make such an allegation
about the President's Office. I pointed out at the time that if this was an
allegation against a department rather than an individual, it might be in
order.

On examining Hansard, I found that this allegation had indeed been made
against an office, and I have quoted the exact words that were used, not
specifically against a member or members of this House or the President. It
has previously, on more than one occasion, been ruled that it is
permissible to make such comments about an office or a department. And,
accordingly, the statement in question is not unparliamentary.

A further point of order was then raised concerning an interjection made by
the hon Mr Odendaal in the course of my ruling, making the same allegation
about the whole ANC leadership. Hansard did not record such an
interjection. I note that Mr Odendaal is not in the House, but I will
follow up the matter with him as to whether he did, in fact, make such an
interjection. I will leave the matter there, and, as I have indicated, I
will be following up the second part with him.

We will now proceed to the first item on the Order Paper, which is motions.
Mr M T GONIWE: Madam Speaker, there is still another matter.

The SPEAKER: Is it a point of order?

Mr M T GONIWE: Yes, Madam. I would like to know whether it is parliamentary
for people to chew in the House? [Laughter.] The hon Tony Leon is
consistently chewing - look at him, he is chewing gum! [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Will you please take your seat.

Mr M T GONIWE: Unqwakuza itshungama. [He is chewing chewing gum.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Mr Leon, will you take your seat, please.
[Interjections.] Order! I wish to ask all members of this House please to
finish their lunch before they come in. [Laughter.]

          EXTENSION OF TRIAL-RUN PERIOD OF QUESTIONS FOR ORAL REPLY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move the draft
resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That, with reference to the resolution adopted by the House on 1 March
  2001, the period for the trial run of questions for oral reply be further
  extended until 30 June 2001.

Agreed to.

      RECOMMENDATIONS OF JOINT SUBCOMMITTEE ON POWERS AND PRIVILEGES ON
                 TRANSFORMATION OF EXISTING LAW AND PRACTICE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move the draft
resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as
follows:


  That -


  (1) notwithstanding Joint Rule 35(1), the Joint Subcommittee on Powers
       and Privileges report its recommendations to transform the existing
       law and practice on existing parliamentary powers and privileges,
       directly to the House; and

                  (Decision of Question on Second Reading)

The SPEAKER: Hon members, you are aware that the vote was not put

time.

Question agreed to.

                        TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL
                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, hon members, just before dealing
with the Bill, I would like to share with this House the good news that we
advised the country of yesterday, and that relates to the fact that the
Revenue Service has surpassed the revised target that we accepted for the
2000-01 fiscal year. On Saturday, by close of business, the Revenue Service
had collected R219,7 billion. [Applause.]

We were also able to contain expenditure below the budgeted levels, and the
early indications are that the deficit for the previous fiscal year will
come in at 1,9% of GDP. Clearly, the policies of this Government are sound
and the management is very strongly in place. [Applause.]

The Bill before the House provides for the introduction of capital gains
tax in South Africa and is, therefore, the last instalment in the
codification of the comprehensive package of tax proposals announced last
year. It is important to know that the legislation put before this House
today is classified as a section 77 Bill - that is, a money Bill - and,
once introduced, it cannot be amended.
However, in order to ensure public participation and better parliamentary
oversight, a draft copy of the Bill was published for comment on 12
December last year. The finance committees of both Houses of Parliament
held extensive public hearings during January and February, and were
afforded the opportunity to refine the draft legislation prior to its
introduction.

The SA Revenue Service and the National Treasury listened to the concerns
of the public and a revised Bill was published on 2 March, after which the
parliamentary committee deliberations ensued. This participatory process
ensured thorough interaction by all stakeholders. I am, thus, satisfied
that this process ...

The SPEAKER: Order! Minister Manuel, you may note that we need a new sound
system in the NA. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, we need to insist that members should not use
their cellphones in the House. This participatory process ensured thorough
interaction by all stakeholders. I am, thus, satisfied that this process
has been transparent and participatory, and that the voice of business,
trade unions and individuals has been heard and considered. Of course, this
goes far beyond the requirements of section 77 of the Constitution.

Since its announcement last year, capital gains tax has been the subject of
extensive debate by both those who are for and for those who are against
the broadening of the definition of income to include capital gains. In the
process, a lot of emphasis was placed by opponents of capital gains tax on
issues such as the negative impact it will have on the economy, more
specifically on investment in South Africa, entrepreneurship, job creation
and savings; secondly, the lock-in effect it will have on assets in South
Africa; thirdly, the complexity of the tax; fourthly, the small amount of
revenue that it will produce; and fifthly, the lack of indexation.

In dealing with some of these issues, I would first like to put the matter
in perspective. Capital gains tax was announced as part of a wider tax
reform initiative aimed at enhancing the integrity of the tax system,
broadening the tax base and reducing the tax rates. In this regard, it will
bring greater neutrality between the treatment of income of a revenue and
capital nature, thereby reducing the opportunity to recharacterise taxable
income into nontaxable income of a capital nature.

Secondly, it will free up administrative resources in combating
arrangements of this nature, which could be employed more productively in
other areas of tax administration. Thirdly, it will complement and underpin
the effectiveness of administering other taxes and, therefore, serves as a
backstop to the tax system as a whole. Fourthly, it will bring our tax
system in line with international norms in both developed and developing
countries.

As was pointed out by the IMF mission which evaluated the South African
proposals for the CGT, the absence of this tax is a deep-seated weakness in
the South African tax system, and the implementation thereof will
considerably reduce opportunities for tax avoidance. South Africa is,
therefore, now well on its way to the taxation of income on a more
comprehensive basis, in line with international best practice.

On the impact on the economy, savings and investments here, the same report
expressed the view that the effect on private savings is likely to be
slight. The effective rate proposed is very low, a maximum of 10,5% in the
case of individuals and a maximum of 15% in the case of companies. The
impact on the after-tax return will, therefore, be small. I might add that
the best evidence is that total private savings are, in any event, more
responsive to changes in the taxpayer's total after-tax income than they
are to changes in after-tax returns on specific investments.

Reducing the tax rate for companies and individuals, as we have done, is
far more likely to encourage savings. The point was also made in the
hearings before the committees that the extent to which capital gains tax
has an impact on investment, is that it improves the allocation of
resources in the economy by reducing the artificial preference for certain
forms of passive investment income.

Foreign investment is likely to be unaffected by the introduction of CGT,
since both long and short-term investors in South African companies are
generally exempted from CGT on the disposal of their shares. Even where a
foreign investor does pay capital gains tax on the disposal of the South
African asset, the tax credit against this tax paid in the whole
jurisdiction will be available for the tax paid in South Africa.

Although there is a debate on the real extent of the lock-in effect,
whereby taxpayer holds assets rather than sells them in order to avoid
capital gains tax, the proposed legislation has a number of design features
that minimise such an effect: Firstly, the low inclusion rates that have
been selected; secondly, taxation of capital gains at death, which removes
the incentive to hold assets up to death in order to qualify for
preferential treatment; and thirdly, the hold-over provisions that defer
capital gains on the disposal of plant, machinery, aircraft and other
assets used for business purposes until such time as the tax allowances on
the replacements are available, to shield the taxpayer from the cash flow
impact of capital gains tax due.

In respect of complexity, we know that, like beauty, it is very much in the
eye of the beholder. The proposed CGT legislation is relatively simple when
compared to that of other jurisdictions Indeed, much of the complexity in
other jurisdictions' legislation comes from special concessions granted to
one interest group or another. I do not wish to imply that the proposed
provisions are without complexities at all, but we were mindful of the
complexity of the capital gains tax systems of other countries and,
therefore, endeavoured to make the rules as simple as possible.

In respect of revenue yield, the projections are that we will garner
between R1 billion and R2 billion a year once the system is fully phased
in. It is a significant amount of tax, but what will be even more
significant are the amounts that will be flushed from hiding and will be
properly declared in the ordinary income tax system, in the VAT system, and
for other taxes, once CGT has been implemented. It is these amounts, which
are so difficult to measure, that are conveniently ignored by opponents of
capital gains tax.

In respect of indexation, balanced against the calls for simplicity have
been calls for inflation indexing of capital gains. Apart from the fact
that it is conceptually unsound to index only a part of the income tax
system, the main problem with indexing is the complex record keeping that
will be required of taxpayers to calculate the adjustments. Other
jurisdictions have experimented with indexing and have abandoned it. We
should learn from their experience.

I would also like to say a few words on the process followed in developing
this Bill. On Budget day last year a guide setting out the key principles
of CGT was released and public comment was invited. Over 300 submissions
were considered. Then, after extensive preparations, a first draft Bill was
released on 12 December last year. Once again, responses were received from
more than 150 interested parties.

The Portfolio Committee on Finance and the Standing Committee on Finance
held joint hearings on the matter during the period 23 January to 9 March
2001, which generated a great deal of debate and interest. During this
process the committee had the benefit of hearing the views of international
academics who are experts in this field of taxation. The second draft Bill
was then released on 2 March, which took into consideration many of the
issues and concerns raised during the hearings.

The opportunities for interested parties to make an input into the process
were therefore extremely wide and transparent. I therefore wish to express
my appreciation to the public, whether in their personal capacity or via
organised groupings, for their participation and assistance, which have
been of invaluable assistance in preparing and finalising this Bill.

Notwithstanding the above process, many organisations expressed the view
that if 1 April 2001 had remained the date for implementation of capital
gains tax, it would have been impossible for them to change their systems
in time to comply with the provisions. In this regard, the Government
displayed an understanding by deferring the effective date to 1 October
2001.

Let me turn to reporting the requirements. These have been included in the
Bill in order to assist taxpayers. Unit trusts must, for example, report
all gains made by unit holders on the disposal of their assets. After
extensive discussions to ensure administrative simplicity, unit trusts will
be allowed to use a weighted average basis to report the base cost of the
units disposed of by unit holders.

As is usual in the case of tax legislation, appropriate anti-avoidance
rules had to be included. The following are examples of such measures:
firstly, value-shifting rules to combat the shifting of value from one
person to another without triggering off a disposal; secondly, the
disregarding of losses on disposal of certain personal-use assets; and
thirdly, the ringfencing of capital losses, thereby not allowing them as a
set-off against ordinary income in order to protect the existence base.

Various amendments also had to be made, consequently, to other Acts.
Examples in this regard are, as the R1 million exclusion in the case of a
primary residence only applies to natural persons the transfer duty
exemption is being introduced to allow for the transfer of a primary
residence held via a company or trust back into the name of the individual
who resides on the property. A cut-off period of one year will, however,
apply during which individuals can make use of this relief measure.
Important adjustments are proposed with regards to the taxation of a long-
term insurance, following the introduction of capital gains Tax, more
specifically with regard to the formula regulating the deduction of certain
expenditure incurred by the policy holder funds of the insurer.
A lot of hard work has gone into the preparation of this Bill. I therefore
wish to thank the members and the respective chairs of the Portfolio
Committee on Finance and the Select Committee on Finance for the role that
they have played in finalising this Bill, and in demonstrating how to deal
with the complex section 77 legislation.

No doubt capital gains tax remains a complex issue and, as in the case of
the other jurisdictions, the provisions will require refinement over time.
I would like express my sincere appreciation to the teams from the SARS and
the Treasury who worked on this Bill. Kosie Louw, Frans Tomaseck, Keith
Engel, Martin Grote and their teams have done remarkably well to ensure
that we could include many of the concerns raised. [Applause.]

Against that background I hereby table the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill.
[Applause.]

Bill, together with the introductory speech, referred for consideration and
report to the Joint Committee on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 2001,
established by resolution of the House on March 2001.

                          SOUTH AFRICAN BOXING BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Madam Speaker ... [Interjections.]
[Laughter.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Watch out for Johnny de Lange. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, Cabinet colleagues and hon
members, after soccer, boxing rates as one of the most popular spating
codes in our country. Due to the nature of boxing, it is also the only
sport that is regulated by an Act of Parliament. Professional boxing is
currently legislated by the Boxing Control Act No 39 of 1954 that is
intended particularly in the boxing fraternity to look after the interests
of the most vulnerable constituency in boxing, viz the boxers themselves.

The current legislation, however, has numerous shortcomings. The current
Act ranks among the oldest pieces of legislation still on the Statute Book
from the apartheid era. Indeed, it is older than many, if not the majority,
of members of this House. It is as antiquated as the apartheid system under
which it was first introduced. Instead of promoting the sport, it serves to
hinder and obstruct the growth and development of professional boxing.
Moreover, in many respects it is simply just unconstitutional.

It is a coincidence that the South African Boxing Bill is being presented
in this House barely two weeks before the staging of the first heavyweight
world title fight, involving two heavyweight boxers, Lennox Lewis and
Hassim Rahman, in our country. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

This Bill paves the way, amongst others, for a streamlined procedure that
will cement our future as a global player in professional boxing. It rids
us of a structure that does not serve the best interests of the primary
stakeholders in the sport, ie the boxers themselves. Furthermore, it lifts
the prohibition on females boxing, a clause in the current Boxing Act that
is in conflict with our country's Constitution. I must say that under this
Bill, we will make sure that there are safety measures ensure that nobody
gets injured.

More than that, the South African Boxing Bill ensures an effective and
efficient administration of professional boxing and creates a mechanism for
a synergy between boxing in the paid ranks and amateur boxing, a feature
that is presently lacking to the detriment of the sport.

The Bill also provides for the establishment of a lean and mean boxing
commission to be known as Boxing South Africa, and allows all role-players
the right to organise within their own ranks. Boxers, managers, trainers,
officials and promoters will now enjoy the right to form associations or a
federation of associations to serve their respective interests.

It is no secret that the vast majority of professional boxers struggle to
eke out a living. On their retirement, many boxers are destitute with
nothing to show for their years of dedication to the sport and their
sacrifices in the ring. They become mere statistics and face a new struggle
for survival once their competitive days are over. Here we think of boxers
like Norman `Pangaman' Sekgapane, `The Blue Jaguar' Morodi, `Happyboy'
Mgxaji and a lot of other boxers. The new Bill will prevent all of that.

This Bill is also an attempt to address the inequities that exist between
the boxer on the one hand and the other role-players on the other, who
benefit from the exploits of the boxer without being subjected to dangers
in the ring. This Bill also seeks to provide for a smooth transition from
amateur boxing to the professional ranks, thus putting a stop to the
uncontrolled exploitation of young boxers by unscrupulous matchmakers who
are more concerned with lining their own pockets with money than the health
and safety of our youth.

Under the existing Act professional boxing has been haemorrhaging
profusely. The rights of boxers have been trampled upon and obligations on
the part of agents, promoters and other beneficiaries have often been
ignored and disregarded. The sport faced financial ruin. The S A Boxing
Bill is an attempt to rectify that situation and, furthermore, to provide
for an effective dispute-resolution mechanism that the Act currently lacks.

The independence of Boxing South Africa is guaranteed by this Bill and
Boxing South Africa will have jurisdiction over all national and
international fights in the provinces of the Republic of South Africa. This
Bill creates the mechanisms for the effective marketing of boxing, both as
a sport and as a business, and it provides a framework for the
establishment of infrastructure that will ensure the growth and development
of professional boxing.

I cannot see how this Bill could pose any problem to anybody. It reflects
the principles enshrined in our Constitution and protects the rights of
participants as citizens of our country. Not even `yours truly' over there
or all of them should oppose ... [Interjections.]Is he not here? He is busy
chewing bubble gum. Not even the opposition should have a problem with it,
considering the valuable contribution they enthusiastically made in the
preparation of this Bill in the portfolio committee.

Hon members before I become the world champion by beating one of the
opposition members ... No, on second thoughts I should not. I present this
Bill to this House. [Applause.]

Ms N R BHENGU: Madam Speaker, hon members, the Bill we are presenting
before Parliament today is aimed at overhauling the Boxing and Wrestling
Control Act of 1954. The 1954 Act provided for the establishment of the
South African National Boxing Control Commission.

The objects of that commission were to regulate, control and exercise
general supervision over boxing and tournaments with a view to the
elimination of undesirable practices and the protection of the interests of
boxers, trainers, promoters, officials and the public generally.

Hon members will observe that there is no mention of the promotion of
female boxers in the Boxing and Wrestling Control Act of 1954. The 1954 Act
is therefore discriminatory in that it prohibits and excludes women from
boxing. It is not in line with the Constitution.

The 1954 Act did not provide for a firewall between managers and promoters.
As a result, promoters could also have a financial and material interest in
the management company of a boxer. The Bill that we are presenting today
provides for a firewall and a separation of roles between the manager and
the promoter of the boxer, thereby prohibiting the promoter of a boxer from
becoming a manager or having a material or financial interest in the
management company of a boxer.

Regarding the structure of the boxing commission, as reflected in the
Boxing and Wrestling Control Act of 1954, the commission was composed of 11
members. There was a chairperson, an additional member, a medical
practitioner, a public accountant, an advocate or a practising lawyer and
six additional members who were from the provincial boxing commissions.
They were all appointed by the Minister after nominations had been made by
the provincial commissioners.

The new Bill provides for a board which consists of not fewer than four
members and not more than seven members. They will all be appointed by the
Minister, after the Minister has consulted with the associations of boxers,
promoters, managers and trainers. That deals with the composition of Boxing
SA. Regarding the tenure of office, the members of Boxing SA will hold
office for three years.

Hon members will remember that this Bill was introduced last year, and it
was after we had conducted the public hearings that it was referred back to
the Ministry by the Joint Tagging Mechanism, when it was found to be a
mixed Bill. It had to be separated into a section 75 Bill and a section 76
Bill. What we are presenting here today is only the part that falls into
the section 75 category. The section 76 part of the Bill still has to be
processed and introduced according to the rules and requirements of a
section 76 Bill.

In view of the problems that we encountered when we were conducting the
public hearings, and also in terms of having to relate the submissions made
at the public hearings in respect of the section 76 part of the Bill, I
want to put it on record in this House that there was co-operation amongst
all the political parties, including the DP. I would like to express my
exceptional appreciation for the contributions that were made by the hon
Swart from the DP. [Applause.] He proved to the committee that he has a
legal background. An enormous contribution was also made by the hon Mr
Clelland, Mr Ferreira from the IFP, and all the other members of the
portfolio committee.

I am mentioning this about the DP, because there was a turnaround when Mr
Lee joined the portfolio committee, in the sense that when it came to the
voting, he said that the DP was going to vote against the Bill. When asked
to explain the position of the DP, he said that the DP had a principle of
not voting in favour of laws that are proposed by the ANC. [Interjections.]
They also strongly believed that, even if they participated in the debate
and contributed, they would still not vote for it. That shows the
inconsistency and confusion in the DP.

This Bill is in line with the Constitution and the ANC supports the Bill.
We call upon the House to vote in favour of the Bill. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, I will stick to the facts. No other country can
attest more to the enormous potential of sport as a unifying factor. South
Africans have experienced it, but, at the very same time, sport can also
prove to be an agent of division. South Africans can also attest to that.

The DA's initial guarded support for the South African Boxing Bill stemmed
from our belief that the Bill was aimed at giving structure to boxing in
our country and at creating channels of communication between the different
role-players in the boxing world. However, the Bill intends to do more than
just that. It is in line with what has become Government practice over the
past few years, namely the creation of yet another commission, with the
Minister of Sport and Recreation appointing the members to that commission.
It is quite evident that South Africa is falling victim to an ever-
increasing tendency on the part of the ANC-Government to centralise the
functioning of the state apparatus in order to gain control over all
sectors of society. This tendency is evident in the South African Boxing
Bill. The establishment of a boxing commission should be seen for what it
really is. It is an attempt by the Government to hand out jobs to its
cronies and to control boxing.

Die DA glo sterk dat die Suid-Afrikaanse Bokswetsontwerp om die volgende
redes teengestaan moet word: eerstens, sentraleregeringsbetrokkenheid in
Suid-Afrikaanse sport moet tot 'n minimum beperk word ... [Tussenwerpsels]
... tweedens maak die bestaan van die statutêre liggaam, die Suid-
Afrikaanse Sportkommissie, die skep van 'n bokskommissie of Boks Suid-
Afrika onnodig; en derdens moet die regeringsfondse aangewend word, en dit
is belangrik, vir die skep van 'n gunstige omgewing vir die ontwikkeling
van Suid-Afrikaanse sporttalent, en nie om die staatsburokasie uit te brei
nie.

Hoekom het ons 'n bokskommissie nodig om onder andere die deelname en
betrokkenheid van vroue in boks te bepaal? Ons het dan 'n Grondwet. Die
handves van menseregte, in hoofstuk 2, artikel 9(1) van die Grondwet,
waarborg aan almal gelykheid voor die reg, en voorts in artikel 9(4) word
onder andere seksuele diskriminasie verbied.

Die DA is van mening dat die Wetontwerp se doelwitte prysenswaardig is,
maar ons bevraagteken die skep van 'n nuwe wet om boks in hierdie land te
beheer, en staan dit ten sterkste teen. Kort voor lank sal elke sportvorm
in hierdie land gereguleer word uit die gange van die Parlement.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The DP firmly believes that the South African Boxing Bill must be opposed
for the following reasons: firstly, central government involvement in South
African sport must be kept down to a minimum ... [Interjections] ...
secondly, the existence of the statutory body, the South African Sports
Commission, makes the creation of a boxing commission or Boxing South
Africa unnecessary; and thirdly, government funds must be utilised, and
this is important, for the creation of a favourable environment for the
development of South African sporting talent, and not to extend the state
bureaucracy.

Why do we need a boxing commission inter alia to provide for the
participation and involvement of women in boxing? We do have a
Constitution. The Bill of Rights, in chapter 2, section 9(1) of the
Constitution, guarantees everyone equality before the law, and furthermore
in section 9(4) gender discrimination, among other things, is prohibited.

The DA is of the opinion that the objects of the Bill are praiseworthy, but
we question the creation of a new Act to control boxing in this country,
and strongly oppose this. Before long every type of sport in this country
will be regulated from the corridors of Parliament.]

The DA therefore proposes that, firstly, an audit be conducted on the
current workings of the SA Sports Commission to determine its deficiencies.
Secondly, the consequent report should be made public and brought to the
attention of South African sportsmen for their input in the matter. Thirdly
... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order, hon member! Hon Ms Botha?

Ms N G W BOTHA: Madam Speaker, I would like to know whether it is in order
for the member to keep on referring to the DA, because we do not have a
political party here known as the DA. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Hon member, when I listen attentively, quite often members
make reference to nonexistent entities in their speeches. [Laughter.] They
do not have to be present in the House. Please proceed, hon member.

Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, the third point is that former professional and
amateur athletes should be co-opted to administer sports in a professional
manner in South Africa. Fourthly, the Government should stop acting as a
job-creation agency which, in the process, puts more of a strain on the
already cash-strapped taxpayer who will have to foot the bill for yet
another ill-conceived governmental endeavour.

Fifthly, the Government's finances should rather be spent on the
development of young, talented boxers by building more boxing gyms where
the Dingaan Thobelas and Baby Jack Matlalas of the future can hone their
skills. I hope that the Minister will donate those boxing gloves to those
gymnasiums and those boxers.

The DA believes firstly that sport in this country should be depoliticised.
[Interjections.] The South African sports fraternity must not allow sport
to be used as a tool to score cheap political points. Let us fight to put
the interests of our athletes first, and not those of the politicians and
the administrators. [Applause.]

Mr E T FERREIRA: Madam Speaker, when I looked at the Minister from where I
was sitting when he was at the podium I first thought that maybe we could
have a few rounds of sparring, but then I realised I was a heavyweight and
he was a super heavyweight. He probably will be more suited to sparring a
few rounds in his weight division with the member of the New NP who is
wearing a blue shirt today. [Laughter.]

The South African Boxing Bill came before our committee some time last
year. It was a horrendous Bill, which was deservedly shot down in flames by
all the stakeholders who took part in the long public process we had in the
portfolio committee. The Bill was badly written, and one got the impression
that the writers had no idea that South Africa had a Constitution, nor that
legislation could be in breach of the Constitution.
The Bill was subsequently withdrawn because, amongst other things, it had
to be split into both a National Assembly and a NCOP Bill. The Bill before
us, therefore, does not contain the many issues pertaining to provinces,
which one I would have liked to talk about.

When the Bill came back to us earlier this year it was a major improvement
in many aspects. Gone was the ridiculous and clearly unconstitutional
clause 29, which provided that Boxing SA would have the broadcasting rights
to tournaments and that they would then decide which promoter would promote
a particular tournament. This was never going to be on.

Other changes which improved the Bill considerably were also made, of which
many were technical. Right at the end of the process, the committee amended
clause 9 of the Bill to ensure that the Minister consults with boxing
federations and stakeholders before appointing the members of Boxing SA.
This really made one feel much more comfortable about supporting the Bill.

The people opposing the final product in front of us today are doing so on
the basis of excessive ministerial powers and Government interference in
sport in general. Although there is undoubtedly some merit in their
arguments it is also true that boxing has been through many turbulent times
in recent years. No one can deny that many people in the boxing fraternity
have been exploited for a very long time, and none more so than the boxers
themselves. This Bill will definitely improve that situation, and therefore
needs to be supported.

Debate interrupted.

                          UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE

                                  (Ruling)

The SPEAKER: Hon Mr Morkels take your seat please. Hon members, the
reference to a blue shirt has reminded me of another blue shirt in the
House, and that Dr Odendaal is now in the House. Earlier I made reference
to a statement allegedly made by him and a ruling, half of which I have
given. The further point of order that was raised was in respect of an
interjection by Dr Odendaal in the course of my ruling, making the same
allegation about the whole ANC leadership. As I indicated then, Hansard did
not record the interjection. Therefore I must ask Dr Odendaal whether he,
in fact, in the context of the above allegation, did utter the remark: "It
is the whole ANC leadership"?

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Speaker, I said the whole of the ANC leadership is
silent on the issue of farm murders, and then I said, "including Jannie
Momberg". [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Dr Odendaal, in terms of your statement, I think it is
self-evident that we must ask you to withdraw that comment.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Speaker, I will withdraw it if Mr Momberg has
anything to do with it. [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: If the reference was also to the whole leadership, many of
whom are in the House, I think you have to withdraw both.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Speaker, may I enquire whether you are ruling it to
be unparliamentary because I included the name of a member of the House?

The SPEAKER: No, on both grounds. Let me explain. The earlier allegation
was about the Office of the President, and I made the ruling that that was
in order, because we had not accepted that an allegation against an office
or a government department would be unparliamentary. Allegations were made
about them which would have been unparliamentary if made about members of
the House.

The point of order was taken because it was alleged you said this applied
to the whole of the ANC leadership.  You have accepted that you said the
entire leadership or members of the leadership. Now a large part of the
leadership of the ANC, presumably its national executive committee, are
members of this House. And, therefore, on that basis your allegation is out
of order. That is the point and the ruling I am making.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, may I address you on the matter? The hon
Odendaal was not in the House earlier when the word "incite" was used. He
is saying now that he did not say anything about "incite". He said "remain
silent" and there is, I suggest to you, a vast difference between that and
the previous allegation.

The SPEAKER: Order! I have to accept the word of Dr Odendaal on what he
said. In that context, it is true, but in the context of what he said about
Mr Momberg, I think you he needs to withdraw that.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Speaker, Mr Momberg is not silent. I withdraw the
remarks. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

An HON MEMBER: Here comes shop steward, Morkel.

                          SOUTH AFRICAN BOXING BILL

                       (Second Reading debate resumed)

Mr C M MORKEL: Madam Speaker, Minister Balfour, hon members, ie the few
that are still here, first the good news. Notwithstanding the Minister's
recent visit to Cuba, he needs to be commended for his regular attendance
of the portfolio committee, especially during the period when we considered
inputs from stakeholders in order to make amendments to the Bill, section
by section. I wish that other Ministers spent more quality time with the
legislators and the people, instead of listening to stale lectures on what
is best for the people from long-winded dictators.

The Bill has noble intentions to provide all role-players in boxing with a
new structure, for both professional and amateur boxing in South Africa, to
establish a new boxing commission known as Boxing SA. But, most
importantly, it is intended to promote better interaction and
interrelationships between associations of boxers, managers, trainers,
promoters and officials.

Most would agree that the key motivation for amending any legislation or
sections thereof must always be related to the relevance of that
legislation in the current climate. Fundamentally, legislation must relate
to the needs of society as expressed by that society. Yes, the Minister is
right, the people must govern.

The fundamental question that begs to be asked is: Does this Bill respond
to those people - the boxers, managers, trainers, promoters and officials -
who represent the relevant interests of this society and those who want to
compete in a temperate climate? The answer is an emphatic no.
Notwithstanding sufficient consensus on many crucial aspects, this Bill,
nevertheless, ignores the fundamental inputs which were submitted by
provincial sports departments and other specialists in boxing, with regard
to by whom and how the complex interrelationships within boxing should be
regulated.

Notwithstanding the constitutional provisions to the effect that the people
shall govern, notwithstanding the exhaustive and expensive consultative
process undertaken by the boxing transformation team, notwithstanding the
considered inputs received from additional boxing indabas, as recorded in
the document entitled ``Rationale underpinning the new national structure
for boxing in South Africa'', and noth withstanding the passionate
representations from the portfolio committee, the Minister seems to
blatantly ignore the crux of the input from the abovementioned quarters and
that boxing and the boxing community want to democratically elect their own
leaders and regulate themselves.

Notwithstanding verbal assurances, the Minister refuses to include
unambiguous clauses allowing the specialist associations within the boxing
community to have their elected leaders nominated for selection by the
Minister. Instead, the Minister usurps the right of the people to govern by
giving himself the title of benevolent dictator on the basis that he knows
what is best for the people who cannot govern themselves.

In terms of the Bill, the Minister is given the right to appoint whomsoever
is his whimsical flavour of the month, so that he can dictate what he
believes to be in the best interests of a troubled boxing community. It
sounds familiar, does it not? This seems to be the pervading arrogance of
the ANC. It is clouded by far too much Cuban cigar smoke, perhaps it is
inebriated by far too many lectures by similarly benevolent dictactors, and
it is blinded by the punches dealt, not by the DA, but by the boxing
community during that part of the parliamentary consultation process that
the Minister did not attend.

Although the Bill is a great improvement on the old 1954 Act in that it
removes certain archaic regulations, especially the banning of female
boxing - we support those aspects of the Bill- because it attempts to
regulate the eradication of corruption and attempts to deal with corruption
by changing the structure, we cannot support the Bill. The people must be
part of the decision-making, from the bottom all the way to the top.

An HON MEMBER: What about soccer at Newlands?

Mr C M MORKEL: We will get to soccer later. [Applause.]

Mr C T FROLICK: Madam Speaker and hon members, the debate in Parliament
today on this Bill, which aims to provide for a new structure to oversee
professional boxing in South Africa, brings to an end months of hard work
by the portfolio committee members, the department, the provinces and all
other stakeholders involved in boxing. Simultaneously, we are witnessing
the dawning of a new era, which will relaunch the sport in order for it to
occupy its rightful position in the South African sporting fraternity, and
another piece of apartheid legislation, viz the Boxing and Wrestling
Control Act of 1954, is being repealed and relegated to the rubbish bin.

Unfortunately, the impression has been created here this afternoon that all
of a sudden we have a super-Minister with super-powers to govern, control
and participate in boxing. Members of the committee who were involved in
the discussion of this Bill from its infancy can bear testimony to the fact
that the Bill seeks to address and rectify legacies of corruption,
exploitation of boxers and maladministration which are prevalent in the
sport.

Not only does the Bill create synergy between amateur and professional
boxing, but it also enables women to participate in the sport of their
choice. This provision brings boxing in line with the Constitution and will
certainly lead to greater interest and growth in the sport. The UDM,
however, requests the Minister and Boxing SA to expedite the drafting of
the necessary regulations.

After the lengthy process of consultation involving, amongst others,
broadcasters, promoters and other stakeholders, the committee was faced
with 24 pages of proposed amendments to the original Bill. Amongst the
objections raised were broadcasting rights, promotion rights, composition
powers and location of provincial bodies, and the composition of Boxing SA.

It is the considered opinion of the UDM that these concerns have been
effectively addressed and that the stakeholders have indeed been consulted.
The bone of contention at the moment is clause 9 of the Bill, ie the
composition of Boxing SA. Clause 9(2) allows the Minister to appoint
members of Boxing SA after consultation with stakeholders. There is a fear
that the Minister will abuse his power and make unilateral appointments.
However, the UDM believes that the necessary checks and balances exist in
our constitutional democracy and in civil society to avoid and deal with
such an eventuality, if it occurs.

The attempts by politicians to use legislation of any sort to stifle the
competitive spirit of our sportspeople and to abuse their powers in order
to score political points and settle political differences, is well
documented. In response to these concerns, we must ask the following simple
questions: What is the responsibility of the Minister of Sport and
Recreation? Is it the Minister's responsibility to sit back and do nothing
when boxing is in a state of disarray, with the type of mafia operating in
certain sectors? Is it the Minister's responsibility to withdraw when many
of the stakeholders show little or no inclination to address the problems
in the sport, since a lot of these stakeholders have vested interests? Is
it the Minister's responsibility to accept recommendations unquestioningly
as opposed to consulting on board appointees, when he fully knows that such
recommendations could well include members who are part of the problem?

Lastly, we cannot lose sight of the international image of boxing. It is
the Minister's responsibility not to fold his arms while boxing in South
Africa descends into the gutter and our international image is tarnished.
No sports lover can allow this to happen and that is why the UDM supports
the Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, the ACDP wants boxing in South Africa to
clean up its act. Boxing SA should be an apolitical body with certain
constraints placed upon the Minister's authority. The Bill states that this
is an independent body, yet, given the nature of South African history,
sport has always been mixed with politics and the independence of sport has
been compromised. It is the duty of this House to ensure that we clean up
the downside in our sport. The clean-up of our sport is a provincial
responsibility. All provincial sporting bodies must be accountable in order
to effectively restore good governance and discipline in the industry.

Boxing worldwide has been called upon to undergo reforms. This House may or
may not agree with me when I say boxing is equivalent to a dog fight.
Humans use their fists, while dogs are encouraged to fight till they die.
Boxing with gloves is just an attempt to make it more humane, but the
appeal to inflict injury is still the same.

One of the great problems with a sport like boxing is that it attracts
ruthless and unscrupulous agents and promoters. In America we hear of
promoters and managers who abuse contracts to enrich themselves at the
expense of the fighters. In the Eastern Cape, for example, we have also
heard of promoters who have been found guilty of underpaying boxers and of
mismanagement by the boxing commission in the region. We do realise that
the South African boxing industry needs a total overhaul. Boxing as a
sports provides many heroes.

The ACDP does not support women boxing as this reflects negatively on the
image of women, who are looked upon as ladies and mothers, the nurturers
and protectors of families. They are not viewed as bashers of women.

Mr A MLANGENI: Chairperson ...
An HON MEMBER: Are you going to talk about golf today?

Mr A MLANGENI: No. I am not going to talk about golf today.

Chairperson, the hon the Minister has clearly stated here that protective
measures are going to be introduced to protect people from getting injured.
I am surprised that the hon Southgate is against women taking up boxing. I
want to assure her that they will be protected and she should not worry.

We are engaged here in this Parliament in making laws which are aimed at
transforming South Africa into a better country for all its people. But
there are some people who are against any form of change, and they want to
stubbornly remain faithful to the old order. How sad, indeed.

It is incomprehensible why people who worked very hard in making
constructive contributions aimed at improving the Bill should now turn
around and say they will not be supporting the Bill. Initially they had
said they supported it. Can one seriously claim that one is working with
people with integrity? I doubt it.

This Bill provides for a new structure for professional boxing in South
Africa, while at the same time it recognises amateur boxing, something that
did not exist during the time of the former President Comrade Madiba, when
he boxed as an amateur. The Bill brings something new. It recognises
amateur boxing.

To ensure that professional boxing is effectively and efficiently
administered, the Bill, inter alia, establishes a boxing commission, which
is a juristic person known as Boxing SA. The hon the Minister has already
alluded to this. It will have jurisdiction in all the provinces of the
Republic.

In terms of this Bill, Boxing SA will be an independent body with very wide
powers. One of these powers will be to invest such funds as are not
immediately required for meeting its financial obligations. It will issue
certificates of registration to any person who is not a member of Boxing SA
as a boxer, official, trainer, promoter, manager, and so on. In the
certificate, the period of its validity must be specified.

To avoid chancers, the Bill empowers Boxing SA to test the ability of any
person applying for a certificate of registration as a boxer, trainer,
official or manager as it sees fit. It may also require the applicant to
furnish it with all agreements entered into between the promoter of the
tournament and the boxers and officials participating in the tournament not
later than 30 days prior to the tournament.

Cases are known where promoters have not paid boxers for months after the
tournament. The Bill states that if the agreement between a promoter and a
boxer provides for the payment of a fixed amount to a boxer as remuneration
for his or her services, Boxing SA may require the promoter to deposit that
amount with it prior to the date of the tournament. Boxing SA will then
disburse the money according to the terms of the agreement.

It is important to note that before a boxer can jump into the ring, a
certificate of physical and mental fitness issued by a medical practitioner
must be furnished to Boxing SA not later than 30 days prior to the
tournament. This provision applies to both local boxers and those from
outside our borders who box in the Republic.
In the event of a dispute concerning any matter regulated by or under this
Bill, it provides that any party to the dispute may, in writing, refer the
dispute to Boxing SA, and that it must attempt to resolve the dispute.
Section 9(3) in Chapter 2 of the Constitution states, and I quote:


  The state may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against
  anyone on one or more grounds, including race, gender sex ... Section
  9(4) states: National legislation must be enacted to prevent or prohibit
  unfair discrimination.

The Boxing and Wrestling Control Act of 1954, as amended on several
occasions, prohibited, as members have already pointed out, females from
taking part in any tournament. It states, and I quote:


  No person shall-


  (a) hold or assist in holding any tournament in which any female takes
        part as a boxer or wrestler;


  (b) negotiate with any female with a view to procuring her services as a
        boxer or wrestler at any tournament.

The Bill under discussion has, therefore, repealed large sections of the
1954 Act which discriminated against females. The time for discriminating
against females by not allowing them to become boxers or wrestlers has
passed. I support this Bill and we thank the hon the Minister for
introducing such a progressive Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the Bill has been drafted to provide for new
structures to oversee professional boxing in the country. The MF welcomes
clauses 29 and 30 of the Bill, as they protect and promote the interests of
all parties concerned. It is of interest to note that the Bill makes
provision for the funds of Boxing SA to come from various sources, as well
as for the capacity in which Boxing SA may enter into agreements with other
parties.

The allegations of favouritism, vested interests and so on made by the
South African boxing administration prompted the previous Minister of
Sport, Steve Tshwete, to set up an internal boxing commission to
restructure the sports administration when the South African National
Boxing Control Commission was disbanded in February 1999. The boxing
transitional body appointed by Minister Tshwete paved the way despite the
obstacles encountered.

Harry Moses was allocated the task of clearing up South Africa's boxing
administration and delivering positive findings to the hon the Minister of
Sport, Ngconde Balfour, last year. This led to the redrafting of the Boxing
and Wrestling Control Act, since boxing had seen tremendous progress with
the National Boxing Commission inheriting R400 000 from M-Net and the SABC,
and hosting a fund-raising event to raise funds for the administration of
boxing.

All of the aforementioned suggest that boxing is definitely here to stay,
and has a future in this country. The MF supports the SA Boxing Bill of
2001 and recommends the legalising of women's professional boxing, since
gender equality at all levels is definitely the way forward in our
democratic country. We support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, can you imagine Miss Rajbally in the boxing
ring? [Laughter.]
Ek kan hierdie wet ontwerp opsom met die volgende woorde: dit is die regte
diagnose, maar die verkeerde medisyne. Die diagnose is reg. Ons weet die
boksbedryf in Suid-Afrika is korrup. Boksers word uitgebuit en daar is 'n
mafia in beheer. Die medisyne wat hierdie wetsontwerp voorskryf, is
absolute staatsbeheer. Dit is 'n uitklophou vir sport as
gemeenskapsaktiwiteit en die toonvenster van totalitarisme. Absolute
staatsbeheer oor elke uithoekie van die mens se bestaan is ons voorland as
ons vir elke probleem wat daar in die land is, permanente beheer van die
gemeenskap na die staat toe oorskuif. Dit voorspel niks goeds vir ander
sportsoorte nie.

Ons oorskry hier die mag van die staat. Die taak en die funksie van die
Departement van Sport moet wees om 'n klimaat te skep waarin sport as
menslike aktiwiteit kan groei en gedy. Hierdie wetsontwerp gee permanente
en totale beheer oor boks in die hande van die Minister. Hy stel die lede
van Boks SA aan - selfs die hoof uitvoerende beampte kan nie sonder hom
aangestel word nie. Hulle mag nie sonder die Minister besluit waar sy
hoofkantoor gaan wees nie, soos vervat in klousule 6(2). In klousule 7(1)
word aangedui dat Boks SA selfs die Minister se goedkeuring nodig het oor
hoe Boks SA sy fondse moet belê. Die wetsontwerp gaan aan tot klousule 34 -
die hele alfabet was amper nie genoeg gewees nie - om al die funksies van
die Minister uit te spel.

Gaan ons naderhand dieselfde staatsbeheer kry oor jukskei en kennetjie ook?
Ons kan nie toelaat dat elke terrein waar daar probleme ondervind word,
onder die plak van die staat kom nie. Daar bestaan ander oplossings. Daar
kan tydelike noodmaatreëls getref word totdat alles in orde is en dan sal
sake weer genormaliseer word.

In klausule 2(r) word voorsiening gemaak vir vroueboks. Dit is 'n
uitklophou vir alles wat vroulikheid behels. Boks is 'n geweldsport met die
doel om te beseer. Het ons nou so opgeskeep geraak met absolute gelykheid
dat ons geen sin meer oorhou vir die spesifieke skeppingsaard en -rol van
die vrou nie? 'n Vrou in die bokskryt druis in teen die beeld wat die Bybel
van die vrou teken.

Ons kan hierdie wetsontwerp ongelukkig nie ondersteun nie. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I can sum up this Bill in the following words: It is the right diagnosis,
but the wrong medicine. The diagnosis is correct. We know that the boxing
industry in South Africa is corrupt. Boxers are exploited and a mafia has
control. The medicine prescribed by this Bill is total state control. It is
a knock-out blow for sport as a community activity, and the display window
of totalitarianism. We are doomed to total state control over every single
aspect of human life if we transfer permanent control of the community to
the state in respect of every problem in the country. It is a bad omen for
other kinds of sport.

We are exceeding the authority of the state here. The task and function of
the Department of Sport should be to create a climate in which sport as a
human activity can grow and flourish. This Bill gives the Minister
permanent and total control over boxing. He appoints the members of Boxing
SA - even the chief executive officer cannot be appointed without him. They
are not allowed to decide where the head office will be without consulting
the Minister, as stipulated in clause 6(2). Clause 7(1) provides that
Boxing SA even requires the approval of the Minister before it invests its
funds. This Bill goes up to Clause 34 - it needed virtually the entire
alphabet - enumerating all the functions of the Minister.

Are we eventually going to have the same state control over ``jukskei'' and
``kennetjie'' as well? We cannot allow every area in which there are
problems to come under the control of the state. There are other solutions.
Temporary emergency measures can be introduced until everything is in order
and then matters will be normalised again.

In clause 2(r) provision is made for the participation of women in boxing.
This is a knock-out blow for everything that femininity stands for. Boxing
is a violent sport whose aim is to mete out punishment. Have we now become
so obsessed with absolute equality that we no longer have a sense of the
specific creative nature and role of women? A woman in the boxing ring is
at variance with the image of women as depicted in the Bible.

Unfortunately we cannot support this Bill.]

Mr M B NTULI: Comrade Chairperson, Ministers and hon members, the 1954 Act
shows us how horrible apartheid was in the country. This is what the ANC
Government has had to deal with head-on. However, the Bill before us today
seeks to address all those unfair imbalances of the past, without
compromising.
I want to confine myself to female boxing. Apartheid Acts, including the
1954 Act, had placed another workload on the women of our country. Those
were some of the discriminatory practices in South Africa. The ANC, in this
debate, stands firm in its principle of transformation and emancipation of
women in this country. For the first time in this country we want to pass a
law that will allow female boxers to enjoy the sport.

Women were the most discriminated against people in this country. The ANC,
through this Bill, seeks to liberate them. In fact, by introducing this
Bill, we will be in line with the Constitution of this country as it is
long overdue that our women in this sport should be liberated.

The time has come for us to say to women that if music be the food of life,
they should play on and give us the excess of it. We in the ANC want to say
to the dear women of South Africa that the ball is now in their court. They
must choose how to play it without being prohibited by the laws of
apartheid. The DA cannot stand in their way. We want to have the Tap-Taps
and Gerrie Coetzees in this country from the women's side now.

I will ask the female boxers to box against Mr Lee and, obviously, Mrs
Southgate because they do not want them to box. They also do not want them
to be liberated. [Applause.] I would like to say to Shakiera, Desire, and
Liesl that they must now go to the gym to box and be ready for the fights.

The ANC would like to thank the founders of the South African Female Boxing
Association, namely Mumtaz and Mr Mohamed, for inviting the portfolio
committee to their exhibition, sensitising us about the possible breach of
the Constitution, respecting the country's Government by not breaking the
law that has been in existence thus prohibiting them from embarking on the
sport and intervening to stop the tournament that was going to take place
in Durban which would have imported people from other countries thus
leaving the women of this country unliberated.

I know that most of the males should be very worried about females being
unprotected and safety. The Minister has already indicated that they must
rest assured that the females will be protected because there are garments
to protect whatever they feel might be broken into pieces. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Chairperson, I should first of all
like to acknowledge the female boxers who are sitting in the public
gallery. [Applause.] Mrs Southgate should go and sit with them. They can
talk to her. I also wish to acknowledge Smoking Joe, who is one of our
former boxers and our promoter in the Western Cape. Smoking Joe is also
sitting over there in the public gallery. [Applause.]

No responsible legislature or executive authority can allow a sport to self-
destruct. Some of the hon members on that side have, once again, vainly
attempted to portray this Bill as so-called interference in sport by
Government. What they must realise is that this is an attempt to clean up
the mess left by their party which I am presently saddled with, especially
that which was left by Abe Williams.

At the same time, the new Bill will protect our boxers from exploitation
and it allows Boxing SA to monitor and supervise the activities of
international professional boxing bodies. We are trying to look after the
rights of a vulnerable section of our sporting community. I cannot
understand why anybody would want to contest this. If they do, my
understanding is simply that they do not have the interests of our boxers
at heart and that they therefore support their continued exploitation.

As I have indicated earlier, the Bill provides for the participation and
involvement of women in boxing. A convention on women boxers is scheduled
for later this month, with the specific purpose of mapping out the future
for women in boxing. It will be held in Cape Town and we will invite some
members to that convention. In this regard, safety measures and the use of
protective gear will feature prominently in the discussions at that
convention.

The boxing fraternity has already been proactive in preparing themselves
for the new challenges facing them once this Bill is passed into law. A
very successful officials' convention has just been completed in
Bloemfontein, where the foundation was laid for the formation of
associations for officials and the drafting of a rules booklet to
administer tournaments and fights. Boxing is thus on the threshold of
exciting changes.

I should also like to mention that the current interim chairperson of the
Boxing Commission, Adv Solomons is with us, together with the interim CEO,
Mr Dumile Mateza. They are the people who have assisted me to guide boxing
to where it is today. They are sitting over there in the public gallery.
[Applause.]

I would really like to thank the hon members Frolick and Ferreira who spoke
quite well, as well as Mrs Southgate, although she opposes only that part
which is about women. But I thank everybody. With regard to the hon Aucamp,
I cannot say anything. I just leave it at that. I cannot respond at all.

I would like to thank the hon Clelland and Mr Swart, because they made
valuable contributions until the big gun, the hon Donald Lee, was sent in.
[Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Donald Duck!

The MINISTER: So he had to change everything, Mr Donald Duck.
Interestingly, Mr Morkel also contributed. He was asking about white water
rafting and when we would be making some regulations about that. Because
there were white people involved Mr Morkel wanted regulations on that.
[Interjections.]

An Hon MEMBER: Skande! [Disgraceful!]

The MINISTER: Skande! [Disgraceful!]

I also thank Sis Ruth Bhengu and the portfolio committee, as well as the
department and the parliamentary officer, Rodney Swiegelaar, for the
wonderful work that they have put into this Bill. I present this Bill to
the House.

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time (Democratic Party, New National Party African

               SOUTH AFRICAN SPORTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Madam Speaker, hon members and
Cabinet colleagues, the South African Sports Commission Act, No 109 of
1998, which was published in the Gazette on 4 December 1998, provides for
the establishment of the South African Sports Commission. The Act provides
for the commission's powers with regard to sports administration and
development, as well as the enhancement of recreation.

Thus, the South African Sports Commission is, essentially, the vehicle to
oversee matters relating to the administration and promotion of sport and
recreation in our country. With its establishment, it was decided that the
Minister of Sport and Recreation should have a separate smaller department
which would co-exist with the commission. That is the current position with
regard to the department, now known as Sport and Recreation South Africa.
It also became necessary to review the size and composition of the SA
Sports Commission as stipulated in the principal Act and to entrench the
functions as well as the responsibilities of the executive authority.

Given the fact that the Chief Executive Officer, Dr Joe Phaahla, appointed
at the level of director-general, can adequately perform the main thrust of
the functions of the commission, a review was needed for the roles of the
chairperson and the deputy chairperson of the commission. Moreover, it soon
became evident that a board of 30 commissioners would be unwieldy, costly
and clumsy, and that it was not necessary to structure the board on the
basis of representation, but rather on the expertise necessary to perform
vital functions.

The South African Sports Commission Amendment Bill therefore provides for a
streamlining of the composition of the commission, and ensures a greater
degree of accountability to the executive authority. It will contribute
immensely towards allowing me to fulfil my responsibilities as the
executive authority, as stipulated in the Public Finance Management Act. It
provides for a reduction in the of commissioners to a total of 12, the
commissioners being appointed or elected on the basis of their skills or
expertise in areas of sport and recreation, policy formulation, management
and international relations. This will provide for more efficient decision-
making and a consequent improvement in delivery to their clients, the
national federations and other macrosport bodies.

The provision for a general assembly in the amending Bill will further
enhance democracy, representativeness and accountability. The general
assembly will then become the parliament of sport for South Africa. The
Bill further provides for greater accountability in financial matters,
bringing it in line with the PFMA and related Treasury requirements. It is
my contention that this amending Bill will improve the potential of the
commission to play a pivotal role in developing sport and recreation from
grass-roots to gold. At the official launch of the commission on Thursday,
15 March, I described the event as the birth of a new life for South
African sport. Birth brings along with it new challenges, expectations and
opportunities.

There are detractors of the SA Sports Commission. Some of them are seated
here in this House. What they fail to understand and accept is that this
country was forced to start from a zero base in the growth of our sport, as
a result of the selfish and racist actions of the past. The criticism is
quite often shrouded in racist undertones. Those who criticise would prefer
sport to continue in the old ways of the past. They decry any legislation
relating to sport, using the smokescreen that sport should remain
autonomous.

They are very likely to bemoan the fact that the responsibility of the
executive authority is entrenched in this amending Bill. I would like to
remind them, however, that this Bill merely affirms my responsibility,
which responsibility I will not renege on until a fair dispensation has
been entrenched for all South Africans. The opposition conveniently forgets
that they denied the majority of our citizens the right to participate in
sport through their cruel and racist laws.

Again, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Sis Ruth Bhengu for
preparing this Bill for presentation in Parliament. I also include here
contributions from the members of the opposition parties. As we said in the
other Bill, they contributed a lot, especially the two members we
mentioned, but they have now been instructed by their bosses, of course,
with hon Donald Lee riding roughshod over them.

As for the department and the legislators in my department, I would like to
thank them very much. I therefore present to hon members the South African
Sports Commission Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Mr H P CHAUKE: Mr Chairperson, hon members of Parliament, the CEO of the SA
Sports Commission, Mr Joe Phaahla, it gives me great pleasure to introduce
the third amendment to the South African Sport Commission Act on behalf of
the portfolio committee chairperson, Ruth Bhengu.

I wish to commend the Minister for sponsoring this Bill, and for the
leadership he displayed throughout the process. I wish to commend the
members of the portfolio committee, who participated in the discussion of
the Bill and who have made contributions to it. I wish to thank the state
law advisers who have played a role during the processing of the
amendments. Special thanks also go to the staff of the Minister, in
particular Rodney Swiegelaar.

While acknowledging the history of South African sport and challenges posed
by a democratic, nonracial and nonsexist South Africa, the SA Sports
Commission Act resolved to establish the SA Sports Commission, whose
objective is to oversee matters pertaining to the administration and
promotion of sport in the Republic of South Africa under the direction and
leadership of the Minister responsible for sport and recreation.

The amending Bill we are debating today gives impetus to the practical
implementation of the Act in pursuit of its objective of overseeing matters
pertaining to the administation and promotion of sport in our country.
Positive words have been spoken in other debates in this House in favour of
the SA Sports Commission Amendment Bill. I am not going to bore the House
by presenting what has been said so far. The only area that I want to deal
with is the current challenges that are facing the SA Sports Commission.

One of the areas that I want to deal with, is racism in sport, particularly
in the Western Cape. For some time now we have been observing the attitude
of politicians in the Western Cape, denying black people the opportunity to
participate in sports, generally, in Cape Town. The point that I am raising
is the attitude of the major of Cape Town, of not allowing football to be
played at Newlands. It was very clear from the beginning that a motion was
put by a DA councillor, refusing to allow soccer to be played at Newlands.

As a portfolio committee we have met with all soccer teams in the Western
Cape, that is Ajax, Santos and Hellenic. We have met with the owners of
Newlands Rugby Ground and Newlands Cricket Ground. All of them said that
they support football being played at Newlands Stadium and that the problem
lies with local government, whose mayor is Marais of the DA.
[Interjections].

We invited the major to come and appear before the committee on Tuesday
last week. He bluntly refused. We invited him again today to come and
clarify the position of local government, and he again refused.
[Interjections.] The portfolio committee met today just before the sitting
of the House and has resolved that whether he likes it or not, he will
appear before the portfolio committee. He decided not to meet with the
portfolio committee but with the Minister, thus undermining the role of the
portfolio committee in Parliament. That is something we are not going to
accept.

It is clear that when it comes to facilities that are being provided for
sport in this country, the fact of the matter is that during the apartheid
era nice, big and beautiful facilities were built in white areas, whereas
in disadvantaged areas such as Langa and Gugulethu such facilities were not
erected. When people are supposed to start sharing those facilities, they
begin to invoke apartheid ordinances. All along, even while the ANC was in
power, they never invoked those ordinances. Is it because Bafana Bafana was
playing against Zimbabwe? We know very well what the DA's position is
regarding Zimbabwe. We know for a fact that the DA wanted to apply
sanctions against Zimbabwe, but now they are doing it at the wrong time.

Two weeks ago, Safa announced its intention to host World Cup 2010.
Immediately after that, the hon Lee and Mr Marais, who were oppressed just
like me, are in the forefront defending apartheid ordinances. What they are
doing to the people of the Western Cape is a shame. [Interjections.] They
are just windowdressing. The master behind them is just using them, because
of their dark skin, to defend apartheid ordinances. We are not going to
accept it. [Applause.]

Nobody in this country can reverse the gains of our liberation. We fought
for nonracialism, nonsexism and democracy, and we are definitely going to
change the attitude in Cape Town. Because of this attitude, black people
are not welcome in this city - that is a fact. When one goes to a
restaurant or a night club in Cape Town, one is asked for a membership
card. Because one is black, one is expected to have a membership card.
[Interjections.] We are not going to accept the nonsense that is going on
in the Western Cape. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Adv P S SWART: Mr Chairperson, I will at least try to bring some sanity to
the debate.

On 8 October 1997 the former Minister of Sport and Recreation said in this
House, and I quote:


  There is going to be interference from the Government in any sphere of
  life and activity in South Africa, including sport. I repeat, there is
  going to be interference in sport.

It is against this background that the DP, on 14 September 1998, voted
against the principal Act. The DP and DA do not believe that there should
be political interference in sport. We do, however, believe in the very
important unifying role that sport and recreation play in this country to
bring people of all cultures together.

During the debate on the principal Act on 14 September 1998, the then
chairperson of the portfolio committee, the hon Lulu Xingwana, stated, and
I quote, and I hope that this is still the case:


  The Bill makes it clear that the commission will respect the autonomy of
  sport and recreation organizations ... It has never been the intention of
  this Government to run sport in South Africa.

Fortunately, today we find ourselves with a new Minister of Sport and
Recreation since 1999. From the onset it was clear that sport itself was
his major concern, and apart from one or two isolated instances, he
refrained from politicising sport. Unfortunately, on Tuesday in the
portfolio committee during a briefing regarding the playing of soccer at
Newlands, the Minister allowed his emotions to run amuck, and launched into
a party-political attack on the members of the DA, who up to then had tried
to focus on the problem.

Being a civil and soft-spoken person, I will thus only say this about
Tuesday: It was unfortunate, uncalled for and counterproductive. The
Minister being the captain of the ANC sporting team, his team members
followed suit, causing the meeting to turn into a party-political shambles,
which is still continuing today at this podium. However, bearing in mind
what took place when the portfolio committee discussed and debated the SA
Sports Commission Amendment Bill, I personally will regard Tuesday as an
isolated incident.

The Minister attended all the briefing sessions and debates of this Bill
before the portfolio committee and, indeed, played a major role in fine-
tuning the Bill into what it is today. He afforded the opposition
constructive participation in the debate, and also accepted a number of
amendments to the Bill without arguing about which side of the House it
came from. We, and I personally, thank him for that.

The establishment of the SA Sports Commission in 1998 was to ensure that
one body controls and regulates sport in this country. Again, I want to
quote the then chairperson. She said:


  The commission will bring an end to the existence of both our Department
  of Sport and Recreation and the National Sports Council, which will
  effectively amalgamate to form the SA Sports Commission.

Today the Department of Sport and Recreation is still very much in
existence. We need further indications as to how this amalgamation will
continue to be effected.

The principal Act brought into being the SA Sports Commission with 30
members. From the outset, this high number of commissioners was a cause for
concern. If we look at the budget of the Department of Sport and Recreation
for the past two years, instead of money going into development, the
greater part of this budget has been spent on remuneration of employees and
commissioners. This is couterproductive in addressing a terrible backlog in
the development of the previously disadvantaged people in this country.

This Bill seeks to rectify a number of these problems. The commission will
now consist of six members elected by the general assembly, another six by
the Minister. One member must focus on women, another on rural sport
development, and another, preferably a member with a disability, on sport
for disabled persons.
The term of office for these members has been changed to three years from
the previous five years, and members will not be eligible for election or
appointment for more than two consecutive terms. The board itself will
elect a chairperson of this commission.

I would like to tell the Minister that we welcome these changes to the Act.
We think it is a better, mean and lean commission. In the Minister's words,
``I ask you not to appoint mean people''. I am sure the Minister is going
to do so.

To conclude, the DP supports this Bill, which, in all respects, is better
than the existing Act. We did not support the Act that is in place at the
moment. This one is better, and that is why we will support it.

Our remaining concern is that the CEO of the commission is appointed at the
level of a director-general. This is not part of the Bill or the principal
Act, and does not impair our support for the Bill. However, we think that
this needs to be addressed, and we will seek consultation with fellow
committee members and the Minister regarding this.

Allow me to end by thanking the chairperson for the kind words and the way
he participated during the discussion of this Bill. We appreciate that and,
indeed, we are playing a constructive role. Please do the same.

Mnr E T FERREIRA: Mnr die Voorsitter, die agb mnr Chauke het oor alles
behalwe die sportkommissie gepraat.

Miskien sal dit dan in order wees as ek agb lede van my twee pragtige
labradors by die huis vertel wat pas sewe kleintjies gehad het, ses reuns
en een teef, en moenie vergeet dat ek nog van my mooi grys kat ook vertel
nie.

'n AGB LID: Jou chihuahua ook?

Mnr E T FERREIRA: Nee, ek hou nie van chihuahuas nie. [Gelag.]

Die IVP steun die wysigingswetsontwerp op die SA sportkommissie. Dit is nie
'n wysigingswetsontwerp wat ooit op komiteevlak omstrede was of die
wenkbroue laat lig het nie.

Die oorspronklike wet maak daarvoor voorsiening dat daar 30 kommissielede
sou wees wat 'n onnodig groot en lomp organisasie tot gevolg sou hê. Soos
ons gehoor het, word dit nou na 12 lede verminder waarvan ses deur die
Minister en ses deur die algemene vergadering aangewys word. Dit sal
natuurlik ook 'n aansienklike finansiële las van die staat afneem.

Die ampstermyn van die kommissielede word tot drie jaar verminder.
Kommissielede wat bedank, moet dit deur die Minister doen en nie deur die
voorsitter nie. Die rede hiervoor is dat daar soveel persoonlike vetes en
konflik tussen individue en sportorganisasies is, dat as die Minister
minstens van die bedankings in kennis gestel word, hy baie vroeg sal
agterkom wanneer dié soort probleem na vore kom. Ek weet nie of die
argument vreeslik baie water hou nie, maar ons is nie in beginsel daarteen
gekant nie.

Ons wil die sportkommissie ook alle voorspoed toewens met sy werk. Hy moet
reeds geluk gewens word met die uitstekende manier waarop hy die Suid-
Afrikaanse tradisionele spele gehanteer en aangebied het. (Translation of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr E T FERREIRA: Mr Chairperson, the hon Mr Chauke discussed everything
but the sports commission.

Perhaps, then, it would be in order for me to talk to hon members about my
two beautiful labradors at home, who recently had seven little ones, six
males and one female, and not forgetting my beautiful grey cat.

An HON MEMBER: Your chihuahua also?

Mr E T FERREIRA: No, I do not like chihuahuas. [Laughter.]

The IFP supports the South African Sports Commission Amendment Bill. This
is not an amending Bill that was ever controversial at committee level or
that even raised some eyebrows.

The original Act makes provision for 30 members of the commission, which
would have led to an unnecessarily large and cumbersome organisation. As we
have heard, these are now being reduced to 12 members, six of whom will be
appointed by the Minister and six by the general assembly. This will, of
course, also relieve the state of a considerable financial burden.
The term of office of the members of the commission is being reduced to
three years. Members of the commission who resign must do so via the
Minister and not the chairperson. The reason for this is that there are so
many personal quarrels and conflicts among individuals and sports
organisations that if the Minister is at least informed of resignations, he
will realise very quickly when this kind of problem arises. I do not know
whether the argument is a terribly sound one, but in principle we are not
opposed to this.

We would also like to wish the sports commission everything of the best
with its work. It must already be congratulated on the exceptional manner
in which it handled and presented the South African traditional games.]

Mr C M MORKEL: Chairperson, I do not have any dogs to talk about, but I do
have a kitten and I will stick to the topic, the SA Sports Commission. I
need to address some other matters as well.

The SA Sports Commission Amendment Bill is an amending Bill that we would
like to support because it streamlines a bloated structure that exists in
sport at the moment. It also reduces the membership from 30 to 12. Six of
them are appointed by the Minister, and we do not like that part. But,
nevertheless, we support the Bill because it, at least, guarantees a seat
for one person with a disability and reduces the term of office from five
to three years. So, this is not long-term employment. It stipulates that
members of the commission will not be eligible for election or appointment
for more than two consecutive terms of office. Those are the positive
things about it and that is why we will be supporting it.

The Minister mentioned something that was quite worrying earlier on in his
speech. He said that positions on certain matters and laws were cruel and
racist. I think that is unfair, but perhaps the Minister does not know.
Anyway, I will table this document here and give him a copy of it. It shows
that on 9 October 1998 it was the ANC branch in Claremont that raised the
first objection to Newlands being rezoned as a multipurpose facility. They
did it for various reasons, but now the baby is being thrown out with the
bath water. So, the Claremont ...

Mr J H MOMBERG: [Inaudible.]

Mr C M MORKEL: Well, it is an ANC letterhead. I mean, come on guys! The ANC
has used the race card here unnecessarily. [Interjections.] Now, it was at
the time when the ANC was in control of the city of Cape Town. So, who is
at fault here? Whose mess do we have to fix up, now that the DA is in
control? It is the ANC's. So we have to fix it up, and we have already
started fixing it up. Minister Marais has made it clear that soccer will be
played there ...

An HON MEMBER: When?

Mr C M MORKEL: Now, immediately. The permit system will be done away with.
Whilst the three to six months rezoning process takes place, soccer will be
allowed there.

Mr J H MOMBERG: Why so long?

Mr C M MORKEL: That is the way the process works. It is very simple. So,
the Minister made a statement that the DA is cruel and racist when it makes
certain laws. Those laws could have been changed when the ANC was governing
the city of Cape Town. That has not been done. We will now use the
opportunity to fix up the legacy of the ANC in the city of Cape Town and in
the Western Cape. We will allow soccer to be played there, but the ANC
wants to hold the city of Cape Town to ransom. Today, in the meeting of the
Portfolio Committee on Sport and Recreation, the chairperson refused me
permission to table the document, because the truth cannot be heard. The
ANC practises selective morality and truth. [Interjections.]

Simply put, we will continue to expose the ANC on issues like these in the
future. They continually use the race card when they cannot deliver to the
people. They have not delivered a soccer facility in the city of Cape Town.
Whose fault is that? It is their fault. When they were governing the city
of Cape Town, they had the opportunity. Two-thirds of the capital budget
under ANC rule in the city of Cape Town was not used. Use the opportunity.
If the Minister could give it to me ...

Mr J H MOMBERG: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it permissible for
the member to be a shop steward for his father?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That is not a point of order.

Mr K M ANDREW: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it permissible for
Mr Momberg to call the hon member a shop steward?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That is not a point of order.

Mr C T FROLICK: Chairperson and hon members, the proposed amendments to the
SA Sports Commission Act not only reduce the number of members serving on
the commission, but at the same seek to improve the operational function of
its members.

It is obvious that the commission is, indeed, a bit cumbersome to
effectively realise its objectives. By streamlining its membership, the
outputs from the commission should increase, which will lead to greater
effectiveness. This should be to the benefit of all sportsmen and women in
our country. The commission has the overall duty of planning, developing
sport priorities, seeing to the implementation of such priorities, and
monitoring the progress of sport development.

The aim is that this Bill be debated against the background of a great
challenge facing South African sport. The now infamous Newlands saga has,
indeed, revived racial tensions and highlighted the prevalence of racism in
sport. Racism in any form is not only disgusting, but reinforces the two
nations ideology. South African sport can ill-afford a further escalation
in hostilities between the national, provincial and local governments
involving several sports administration bodies.

The UDM proposes that the streamlined SA Sports Commission tackle this
challenge head-on by immediately setting in motion a process to undertake a
thorough review process of all national and provincial ordinances, to
establish whether any of these are in conflict with its operations and the
democratic ethos of postapartheid South Africa. Furthermore, the UDM urges
all the role-players, including the DA, to stop playing games and refrain
from hiding segregation ideology behind new disguises such as zoning
regulations. With each development of this nature, the DA is entrenching
the idea that certain pockets under its rule are still stuck in the old
dispensation.

Sport is one of the most unifying factors in the new South Africa. Every
citizen, the SA Sports Commission, and all political parties must campaign
to protect and nurture this vital nation-building tool. [Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Mr Chairman, the ACDP supported the principal Act, and
therefore we support the amending Bill before the House today.
[Interjections.] However, we do have a few concerns.

The ACDP welcomes the provision in the Bill to reduce the members of the
commission. I do not know whether it was because of its size, but whenever
we needed the commission to address the portfolio committee, the task of
doing so seemed impossible. As we know, there are problems with the
commission, and the Minister knows that too.

One of my concerns with a smaller commission, however, is the question of
representivity. The Minister has authority to appoint six members to this
body. In other words, the Minister decides on 50% of this representivity.
The commission will not be a large body and, as such, the Bill should have
allowed for greater input from relevant stakeholders, in terms of the ratio
of appointments to those of the Minister. The role of the Minister should
be primarily to intervene where the suitability of members who are to serve
on the commission comes into question.

The method of appointment, as currently provided for in the Bill, will
create a body with two heads - one set of appointments controlled by the
Minister, and the other set of equal size possibly going in the opposite
direction. This is of grave concern to us. The commission, if called upon
to decide on sensitive issues, will find itself in a no-win situation,
leaving the Minister with the final authority to decide on whatever
outcomes he desires. It is therefore quite clear that the final and
overriding authority and power of the commission rests with the Minister.

The tasks ahead of the commission will be difficult as it seems it will
need the Minister's permission in almost every area affecting sport,
because such is the manner in which the body is constituted.
[Interjections.]

An Hon MEMBER: Wat se Mangope oor sport? [What does Mangope say about
sport?]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Hy is die beste man wat sport nog ooit gehad het. [He is
the best man sport has ever had.]

Mr Chairperson and the House at large, this Bill is one of the most
progressive that this House has dealt with in recent times. Fifty per cent
of the members of the envisaged commission will be elected by the general
assembly, and the Minister's prerogative will be to appoint the other 50%
within set criteria, such as women, rural development and disabled persons.

The clearly set out three-year term of office challenges the commissioners
to get down to work and not rest on their laurels once so elected or
appointed. That the Bill embodies the spirit of the democratic tenets of
our Constitution is further demonstrated by the fact that the board of the
commission must elect from among its members a chairperson of the
commission who will hold office for a period of 12 months. This speaks
volumes about the responsibility and accountability being given to the
commission.

We have come across instances in which members of boards, councils or
whatever you want to call them, are all appointees of the Minister,
including the chairperson. The approach of this Bill is a welcome
demonstration of the confidence we have in the ability and maturity of our
people.

The appointment of the chief executive officer is based on consensus among
the three stakeholders, ie the Minister, the board of the commission and
Cabinet. The whole exercise is widely consultative and transparent so that
no stakeholder should feel alienated in the matter. We hope, however, that
this consultation will arise from advertisements and interviews, and that
it will have the backing of the majority of stakeholders, if not all. After
all, it will serve no purpose if such consultation amounts to information
about the actual appointment.

The Bill seeks to reduce the current bloated commission to a lean and
effective machine of the people's choice, which will be responsive to the
sporting needs of our people. The UCDP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, the Bill seeks to amend the South African
Sports Commission Act of 1998, Act 109 of 1998. In respect of the
composition of the commission, the MF believes that an increased
representation of women is necessary so as to promote gender equality and
address women's interests in sport. This increased representation could
benefit disabled persons participating in sport and boost efforts to
include individuals with disabilities in mainstream communal activities.

The MF compliments the Government on making provision for a three-year
programme through its ``Building for Sport and Recreation'' project which
emphasises the Government's determination to deliver in areas where the
needs are greatest.

It is noteworthy that the Department of Sport and Recreation aims to
address three fundamental aspects: Firstly, creating opportunities for the
most needy to participate in sport and recreational activities; secondly,
bridging the imbalances that existed between rural and urban communities in
so far as accessibility to adequate facilities is concerned; and thirdly,
contributing towards poverty relief through the creation of job
opportunities.

The MF also welcomes the Minister's appointment of a task team to draft a
way forward for South African sport which identifies key strategic
objectives for sport and recreation in the country. This includes looking
at the greater unity in sports structures and drafting a plan that will
address unity of purpose in the area of securing resources and high
performance.

It is remarkable to find that there has been a growing interest in
athletics at grass-roots level, and a number of workshops to ensure the
delivery of sport are held on a regular basis. The MF supports this SA
Sports Commission Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The next speaker, the hon R M Moropa,
will be delivering his maiden speech. [Applause.]

Mr R M MOROPA: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members of Parliament, I
feel very honoured to be delivering my maiden speech only five days before
the eighth commemoration of the death of Comrade Chris Hani, of which this
year's national event will be taking place at Ermelo in Mpumalanga.

Re re robala ka khutso mogale wa bagale. [Rest in peace, hero of heroes.]

I am saying this because Comrade Hani was a sport enthusiast himself, and
if he were here he would have supported this Bill.

I must first acknowledge the presence of the CEO of the South African
Sports Commission, Dr Joe Phaahla, in the gallery. I also wish to commend
the Minister of Sport and Recreation, Comrade Balfour, for introducing this
amending Bill.

It is almost two years since the passage of the South African Sports
Commission Act, Act 109 of 1998. As a result, the basis for defining the
roles and functions of three components of the commission has been laid.
However, loopholes were apparent. The amending Bill we are debating today
attempts to plug these gaps and ensure that the South African Sports
Commission is able to address present day challenges.

The amending Bill mainly focuses on ensuring that the SA Sports Commission
is a manageable structure geared to implement the objects of administering
and promoting sport in this country. This amending Bill seeks to establish
a lean and manageable structure to oversee sport in the country, and the SA
Sports Commission envisaged in this Bill has a reduced number of members 12
thus cutting down the running costs of the commission.

The Bill starts off by saving more than 50% of the remuneration that the S
A Sports Commission has to pay. This Bill has also passed the test of the
provisions of the Public Finance Management Act, with its measures to
ensure that state funds are protected and state employees are accountable
for their actions. The composition of the commission, as laid down in this
Bill, also facilitates quicker decision-making, as opposed to a commission
composed of a large number of members with resultant cumbersome decision-
making.

The amending Bill recognises the democratic process that must govern our
sporting codes in South Africa, and hence 50% of the commissioners must be
elected by the general assembly, based on their commitment and loyalty to
sport. To this end, the Bill caters for the election of six commissioners.
Experience has taught us that democratic processes do not always give
answers to the broader questions of social transformation, and it is
therefore imperative that we couple the election of the commissioners with
appointments. What is noteworthy about this Bill is the fact that knowledge
and skill in sport management are the overriding criteria for electing and
appointing commissioners. Also noteworthy is the fact that the Minister, in
making his six appointments, is guided by the requirement that provision
has to be made for representation of each of the following criteria: women
in sport, rural sport development and sportpersons with disabilities.

The South African Sports Commission Amendment Bill also seeks to address
divisive tendencies by sport administrators who manipulate sporting codes
for their own selfish ends. As a result of the tug of war, South African
sporting codes end up being the proverbial grass that suffers when two
elephants fight. The Bill, in dealing with the composition of the SA Sports
Commission, seeks to address this challenge.

In conclusion, I wish to state that the amending Bill provides the
commission and the Minister with the mandate to uplift and develop the
sporting urban poor and rural disadvantaged communities. It creates
coherent and people-centred development through sport. The philosophy and
ideals espoused by a democratic Government for the creation of a nonracial,
nonsexist and prosperous nation find their official expression in this law.

A historically divided nation such as that of South Africa sees its hope
for unity in action for change through sport. The streamlining of the roles
and responsibilities of all who have a stake in sport, under the political
guidance of the Minister, is indicative of the ANC-led Government's
commitment to delivering a better life for all South Africans. I therefore
urge the House to pass this amending Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Mr Chairperson, as the Minister
responsible for sport and recreation, I will continue with the formulation
of policies and regulations that will rid our sporting society of the last
remnants of a hated past. In his reply to the debate on the state of the
nation address, our President, Thabo Mbeki, called for the involvement of
greater numbers of our youth in sport and cultural activities. That is one
of the major challenges facing the SA Sports Commission.

I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude, once again, to all members of the
Portfolio Committee on Sport and Recreation, led by the hon member Ruth
Bhengu, for their positive approach to this Bill. That includes the hon
Swart and the hon Clelland. Yes, I know that we clashed on Tuesday. That is
life. We will still clash if there are some things that I am not happy
with. We should not take that personally, because it is not personal. When
I want to take on the hon Mike Ellis with sticks - he does want to have
some stick fighting with me and is practising - it will not be personal
when I take a few swipes at him. [Interjections.]

The contributions of all the members were invaluable and the sporting
fraternity out there can rest assured that, with the calibre of members on
this committee, sport and recreation is in very good hands. That I do not
doubt. The contributions coming from all the members of that portfolio
committee show that they really have come of age, and I appreciate the
support that they are giving me.

I also just want to assure members that in appointing the six committee
members, one appointee will be from business, with the necessary business
acumen, because we need money for the SA Sports Commission; one will have
an understanding of sports policy; one, of course, will come from the
macroboard in Nocsa; there will be one representative for women; one for
the disabled sportspeople; and one with a very rural bias.

I would like to thank the head of the department, Prof Denver Hendricks,
who is a pillar of strength to me, Gideon Boshoff for legislation and the
CEO of the SA Sports Commission as well. I would also really like to thank
Mvuzo Mbebe, who is the Ministerial advisor to me on some of these issues.
He has really been able to guide us. Lastly, I thank the former Minister of
Sport, the number one policeman in the country, and Lulu Xingwana, because
we got this SA Sports Commission from them.

I believe that, at the moment, the SA Sports Commission is really set for
success. It knows where it is going. It has launched its indigenous sports,
and has done a lot of work in the provinces, but much is still expected of
it. I would like to see it being driven amongst the people on the ground,
working very hard to change the situation of sport in our country.

I will not make a comment about Newlands. I will not prejudge the meeting I
will have with Mr Marais, but that meeting does not take precedence over
the meeting and the role of the portfolio committee. [Applause.] The
portfolio committee will still go on with what it is doing. I will meet
with Mr Marais tomorrow morning at eight o'clock to try and find out what
we can do.

The issue of the ANC writing a letter is new to me. I have just received it
now. All I know is that an official wrote a letter and copied the letter to
Mr Killian and I have just said that to the hon member. I do think that we
will be able to resolve this matter.

To the portfolio committee, I think they still have to talk to Mr Marais
and whoever comes with him. I will not block that. I am not a member of the
portfolio committee. I am just a poor Minister. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

     NATIONAL PLAN FOR THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM

                          (Subject for Discussion.)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Mr Chairperson, hon members, ladies and
gentlemen and comrades, this debate on the National Plan for Higher
Education, for which I am grateful to the Speaker and to the parties, marks
a watershed in the history of higher education in South Africa. It brings
to a close a decade of research, engagement and consultation on the need
for and the challenges of transforming the higher education system in South
Africa. This is based on the White Paper on Higher Education of 1997, which
forms the basis for these proposals. This wide-ranging process has produced
a rich variety of policy documents and frameworks, which have contributed
to the development of the National Plan for Higher Education.

The breadth and depth of this process, as I am sure members will agree,
represents democracy at its best - a national conversation between the key
role-players and constituencies in higher education, which has involved
hundreds of researchers, academics, students, workers, management,
businesspeople and other constituencies from higher education, as well as
interested parties, as I said, from labour and business.

This national conversation, I should remind the hon Aucamp, was initiated
by the ANC more than a decade ago. The fact, as I have indicated, that
there will be no further consultations on the national plan is not, as he
suggested in his motion, ``a reflection of the centralist and totalitarian
nature of the ANC.'' On the contrary, it is a recognition that the national
plan represents the collective wisdom and broad consensus of democrats
committed to the creation of a truly South African higher education system,
rather than the narrow and parochial interests of those whom the hon Aucamp
represents.

The time for analysis, revisiting and talking is over. We must now turn
with a single-minded sense of purpose to implement the National Plan for
Higher Education and, therefore, to ensure that we rise to the challenges
posed by a rapidly changing world in which knowledge and skills are not
only at a premium, but at the very centre of the social and economic
development process. This can only be done if the process and the needs are
owned by all the actors - by universities and technikons, by staff and
students and trade unions, and, if I may say so, and I say this very
honestly, by members of this honourable House.

The national plan, on the basis of the core values and principles of the
White Paper which is the point of departure, provides the framework and
outlines the strategies for shaping the transformation of the higher
education system for the coming decades. Its central focus and purpose is
to ensure that higher education institutions are geared up to producing the
skilled professionals and intellectuals required to sustain social and
economic development in the context of globalisation, in particular in
respect of the changes in information and communication technology and its
impact on the world of work. I should also add that the role of higher
education institutions is to strengthen the democratic order by the
creation of the intellectuals to which I referred.

This plan will enable the higher education system to contribute to the
building of a learning society that draws on people of all ages and all
races and from all walks of life, and gives them the opportunity to advance
and develop themselves, both intellectually and materially. In short, it
should enable the higher education system to improve the quality of life of
all our people.

The national plan recognises that the transformation of the higher
education system cannot be left to chance or to the market. The higher
education system has to be managed and directed to ensure that it responds
to the national development agenda. I may be able to hear the cry from some
quarters that this is an infringement of institutional autonomy, that
institutions, basically, should be left to themselves, as we have done over
the past decade, as they are best placed to determine and respond to the
skills and knowledge needs of society. I beg to differ. If institutions
were indeed as well-tuned to the needs of society, how do we explain the
following facts?

Firstly, only 15% of students enrolled in higher education institutions
graduate annually. This is an abysmal figure. Secondly, the participation
rate, as a percentage of the 20 to 24-year-olds per thousand of the
population enrolled in higher education, of black students continues to be
well below that of white students - 40% participation rate on the one hand
and about 12% to 14% on the other.

Thirdly, large numbers of black students are marginalised, not entirely,
but in many satellite campuses and in distance education programmes.
Although there are good distance education programmes, there are others
that are meant largely to ensure that black students are not on the
campuses. Fourthly, black and women students continue to be
underrepresented in programmes that have high economic returns, such as
engineering, technology, business, commerce, and management programmes.
Women of all races are underrepresented in these high-yield subjects.

Fifthly - and this is anarchic - competition rather than collaboration
characterises the relationships among institutions of higher education.
There is good competition, and there is bad competition. There is
competition for achieving excellence. The anarchic competition is the devil
takes the hindmost. This is not the United Kingdom, not the United States,
not Mongolia. This is South Africa, and South Africa needs a collaborative
activity to create the kind of intellectuals we need in our society. This
competition has resulted, in some cases, in institutions closing down so-
called unviable programmes, especially in the fine arts, and in languages,
modern languages and indigenous languages, rather than collaborating to
ensure their continuing.

Finally, there are few opportunities for workers and mature learners of all
races, in particular women and the disabled, to enrol in higher education.
We also find that some 80% of staff, in particular at the senior
administrative and academic levels, remain white and male, and that only
about 5% of women of all races occupy senior academic and administrative
posts. Language also continues to be a bar to access in some institutions.

Then we find another extraordinary thing in that archaic and offensive
practices such as initiation ceremonies, which exclude many people,
continue to be condoned, in places of learning, nogal. I could go on. I
submit that the failure of higher education institutions to move beyond
their apartheid-induced past and spatial geography to create South African
institutions, in terms of values and cultural orientation, represents the
single most compelling reason for not leaving the change agenda to
institutions alone.
There is no comfort in being comfortable and smug.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: But you are a commissar. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER: The Government is committed to institutional autonomy rather
than to ``commissarniks''. We are committed to institutional autonomy. This
is not only entrenched in the Higher Education Act - I say this as a
person, an academic, who has fought for institutional autonomy - but has
been demonstrated in practice, with ministerial intervention ...
[Interjections.] Now, now, please. The hon Mr McIntosh must pay some
credence to facts. They may confuse him in the process. [Interjections.]
They may confuse him in the recesses of Greytown, but we are in Cape Town
now, trying to deal with things intelligently. [Interjections.] Langa has
many more intelligent people than he professes.

I have intentionally limited my intervention to extreme cases of breakdown
in institutional governance. Intentionally I have not intervened. I have
been criticised for not intervening until now, because I felt that the
council and the communities in the institutions should resolve their own
differences.
However, as the national plan indicates, institutional autonomy cannot be
allowed to prevent change and transformation. Higher education institutions
must be held accountable to the people of this country for the large
investment that is made in the system. Mrs Thatcher went much further than
any proposal that is made in this document. Since that member plays at the
feet of Mrs Thatcher's spirit, he should take into account that I am not
going to replicate here what the British authorities have done in relation
to higher education. [Interjections.] No, not economics. The British
transformed all those colleges of technology and universities, because
Oxford University would not give her an honorary degree. So much for big
resentment determining large aspects of higher education policy.
Universities and technikons are key institutions and, as such, must
contribute to the reconstruction and development of South African society.

The national plan also recognises that higher education has different
purposes - of research, of teaching and, here in South Africa, community
involvement. Central to that, unlike in any other country, community
involvement in higher education is enormously important. It is largely
fictitious, in fact, but community involvement is always claimed.

The national plan affirms the Government's commitment to redressing the
inequalities of the past. However, it moves beyond the sterile debates of
the past, in which redress was linked to the levelling of the playing
fields. Instead, it links redress to a central question: Redress for what?
This recognises that leaving aside the feasibility of levelling the playing
fields, which is an impossibility, it may not even be desirable, given the
focus on developing a diverse higher education system. The national plan
therefore suggests that the purpose of redress must be to enable higher
education institutions to discharge their institutional mission, which each
one has to work out, within an agreed national framework.

I also want to reaffirm the role that technikons play in meeting our human
resource needs. The fact that the national plan proposes to restrict
technikons to providing diploma programmes primarily for the next five
years, is not intended, as the technikon sector seems to have interpreted,
to relegate them to second-class status. On the contrary, technikons have a
vital role to play in our broader economic and human resource development
strategy, given their focus and experience in the development of career-
focused programmes and their potential to build a strong, applied research
capacity.

It is precisely because technikons have played an important role in
increasing access to higher education and in supplying the pool of
technical labour, which is central to our economic development strategy,
that the national plan requires technikons to continue to focus on diploma
programmes at least for the next five years. It does not preclude
technikons from offering degree programmes, as 25% of their programmes are
at present for degrees.

I want to emphasise that the responsiveness of the higher education system
to national priorities must be paramount. This may not always coincide with
the interests and predilections of individual institutions. While we are
committed to accommodating these interests, we cannot be held hostage to
them. At any rate, the national plan provides a five-year timeframe, after
which the mission of higher education institutions will be reassessed. This
is important as the national plan is a rolling plan. It is not a dictator
laying down what should happen tomorrow or in December. It is a five-year
rolling plan with established objectives and indicative targets that can be
adjusted, updated and revised on an annual basis in response to changing
conditions.

I also want to caution against hasty and ill-conceived responses to the
national plan. This is most clearly demonstrated in the emotive headline
raising suggestions that the national plan is a devious attempt by the
Government to close down Afrikaans-medium institutions. There is not a
shred of evidence to support this interpretation. The national plan makes
it clear, and I reiterate - as the elder Bush would have said: ``Read my
lips.'' that language should not be a bar to access, and the current
practice of marginalising black students through the establishment of
satellite campuses and distance education programmes is unacceptable. And I
want to caution against the simple reduction of language to culture and
identity.

I submit that for example in the Western Cape, although Afrikaans may be a
common language to different communities, it is no signal that there is a
common culture or identity amongst the different communities in the Western
Cape. The challenge that faces the Afrikaans-medium institutions, and it is
a challenge that many are successfully addressing, is to ensure that the
institutions comply with the spirit of the Constitution and the policy
priorities of our nation.

I should also indicate that I sought advice from the Council on Higher
Education on an appropriate language policy for higher education. In
addition, I have at the same time decided to constitute a working group on
language to assist me in the formulation of policy. I want to announce for
the first time that the group includes the following people: Prof Jakes
Gerwel as Chair, Prof Njabulo Ndebele, Prof Willie Esterhuyse, Ms Antjie
Krog and Dr Nomsa Satyo. I want to reiterate that the time for talking is
over. We have a unique opportunity to turn the system around, but time is
not on our side. We must move with a sense of urgency.

My department has been working enormously hard for the past year and a half
and has seized the task at hand. This is indicated by the fact that we have
hit the ground running in relation to implementation, and they have been
largely responsible.
The National Working Group, which will advise me on institutional
restructuring and collaboration, has been established. It is having its
first meeting tomorrow. It is chaired by Saki Macozoma and consists of a
distinguished range of community, education, business and labour leaders.
The working group will report to me by the end of this year so that
decisions on the new institutional landscape in higher education can be
finalised early next year.

A discussion document on new a funding framework was released last week. My
officials are already in the process of meeting with the vice-chancellors
and institutional planners to discuss the details of submissions on
programme and qualification mixes. They are required to submit these
reports by the end of July. My officials will visit all the institutions by
December so that we can work out the programme for transformation and
change by January. My intention to proceed with the mergers identified in
the plan has already been gazetted last week, those that are being merged
here.

In addition, working groups for the facilitation and establishment - this
is a South African contribution - of national institutes of higher
education in Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape, and the establishment of
single-distance institutions incorporating Unisa, Technikon RSA and the
distance-learning component of Vista University, are in the process of
being set up within the next few weeks. This is in the context of Vista
University being unbundled.

The merger between ML Sultan and Natal Technikon is well on track. This is
a voluntary merger assisted by us, and the councils of these two
institutions need to be congratulated for taking the initiative in this
regard to show some rationality in the Durban area, where they live cheek
by jowl. This is the apartheid-special geography. They are next to each
other and they have been leading independent lives.

I believe that the plan offers a unique opportunity for innovation and
creativity to craft a new system. I am convinced that all role-players in
higher education will grasp the opportunity with energy and enthusiasm. The
plan thus provides all institutions, and I mean all, with an opportunity to
turn their future niche and programme profiles in South Africa.

In assessing the niche programme for a mix of institutions, the Ministry
will pay particular attention to the location of the institutions' mission
and for a profile within the regional and national context, including its
capacity to respond to regional and national priorities and to the
Government's human resource development strategy, which will be launched in
two weeks' time.

May I say, in conclusion, that I call on all members to support the
implementation of the plan. We must turn around our higher education system
to become a key engine driving economic and social development and
unleashing the extraordinary intellectual and ethical strength that we have
among our young people, their contribution to a free South Africa of their
minds, their acumen, their versatility. This plan provides for that rather
than suppresses it.

Developments are taking place which have led South Africa to lead the world
in some areas. Rather than suppressing those, in fact we want to develop
them further to meet our needs. We must therefore act and learn to act in
national interests. Sectoral interest or party-political agendas should not
be allowed to stand in the way of ensuring progress and a better quality of
life for all of our citizens. I commend this national plan to the House.
[Applause.]

Prof S M MAYATULA: Chairperson, hon members, allow me to start this debate
with these wise words by Castells, which are in the plan:


  If knowledge is the electricity of the new informational international
  economy, then institutions of higher learning are the power sources on
  which a new developing process must rely.

These power sources are fuelled by taxpayers to the tune of R7,6 billion
out of a total budget of the national Department of Education of R8,2
billion in the current year. Only in 1997 the higher education budget was
R5,4 billion. The question then arises: Is this value for money? What is
the national plan trying to achieve? The national plan is based on the
policy framework and goals, values and principles that underpin the
framework outlined in the White Paper. There are four of these, but I am
not going to mention them. I would encourage hon members to read those
goals and values in the report.
The national plan addresses the following five key policy goals and
strategic objectives: Firstly, to provide increased access to higher
education to all, irrespective of race, gender, age, creed, class or
disability, and to produce graduates with the skills and competencies
necessary to meet the human resource needs of our country; secondly, to
promote equity of access and to redress past inequalities through ensuring
that the staff and student profiles in higher education progressively
reflect the demographic realities of South African society, and some of
these issues we need to consciously try to do or otherwise they will not
happen on their own; thirdly, to ensure diversity in the organisational
form and institutional landscape of the higher education system through
mission and programme differentiation, thus enabling the addressing of
regional and national needs in social and economic development; fourthly,
to build high-level research capacity to address the research and knowledge
needs of South Africa; and lastly, to build new institutional and
organisational forms and new institutional identities through regional
collaboration between institutions. Each of these objectives is well
motivated in the document. Just a word on regional collaboration between
institutions. Through this plan it is hoped that institutions of higher
learning will start talking to each other to the benefit of all, especially
our students.

Many a student who has dropped out of the system for whatever reason, is
roaming the streets while short of one or two courses to complete their
degree or diploma courses. But, due to the rigidity of the rules of the
game, which prevent crossing from one institution to the other or having
one's course accredited by another, especially when it comes to the so-
called major courses, the student is required to do three or four more
courses in order to graduate at another institution. These uncalled-for
barriers occur even within one and the same institution.

At the beginning of this year, I was approached by desperate parents whose
daughter wanted to follow a career in medicine. This student, who was
determined to do medicine, was, so to speak, wrongly advised in the
passages of the institution. She was advised to do a first-year BSc, so
that she could do botany, zoology and physics. This student passed those
courses with flying colours, some with more than 70%. Unfortunately, the
rules of this university would not allow the same student to register the
following year, because these courses - botany, zoology and physiology -
were not regarded at the same level as biology in matric. Can hon members
imagine this rigidity, where a dean of a faculty does not have the mandate
to apply his authority in cases of this nature? Yet another student was
lost.

Concerning the divide between universities and technikons, which the hon
the Minister has touched on, the report has this to say. For at least the
next five years the Ministry will continue to regard technikons as
institutions whose primary function is to provide career-oriented
programmes at diploma level; and universities as institutions which offer a
mix of programmes, including career-oriented degrees, professional
programmes, general formative programmes and research, masters and doctoral
programmes. This plan goes on to say, and I quote:


  This does not, however, imply that there will be no loosening of the
  boundaries between universities and technikons, as suggested in the white
  paper.

The future of technikons depends on their individually determined programme
mixes and, if necessary, on further surmounting these barriers. The plan
emphasises and states that the process of determining the programme mix of
institutions will be based on an interactive and consultative process
between the Ministry and individual institutions, linked to submissions of
constitutional rolling plans. Even the new funding formula that will be
phased in from the year 2003 will take into consideration these rolling
plans. Therefore, technikons should start putting their plans for the
future forward.

It is important to remember that no institution of higher learning will be
left untouched by this plan. This plan is not peculiar to South Africa. It
is part of what is happening globally. When we talk about co-ordination and
co-operation, some people think that some universities are going to be
closed down. It is also reflected in the plan that no institutional site is
going to be done away with.

With regard to distance education, a number of concerns on its quality have
been voiced. Investigations have indicated that, firstly, these programmes
are based on poorly designed material and rely on civil medium of delivery
that is inappropriate for the student; secondly, a number of programmes
have been developed for use only on the Internet; and thirdly, the quality
of the programme is undermined by a lack of research into the needs and
context of what the student is supposed to be addressing.

In order to address these concerns, the plan proposes to establish a single
dedicated distance education institution through the merging of Unisa and
Technikon RSA, and incorporating the distance education centre of Vista
University into the merged institution. A working group to facilitate the
merger will be established to show that everybody will be taken on board in
these debates.

This National Plan for Higher Education is a great improvement on the ones
before it. It has been accepted by the majority of the stakeholders in most
universities. All that is needed now is for all of us to support it and to
assist in its implementation. [Applause.]

Mr R S NTULI: Chairperson, hon Minister and colleagues, the national plan
provides the framework and mechanisms for the restructuring of the higher
education system to achieve the division and goals of the transformation of
the higher education system as outlined in the White Paper entitled:
``Programme for the Transformation of Higher Education'' released in 1997.
The previous speaker has elaborated at length about this and so I need not
repeat it.

Central to this vision was the establishment of a single national co-
ordinated system which will meet the learning needs of our citizens and the
reconstruction and developmental needs of our society, as well as the
economy. It is the Ministry's response to the Council of Higher Education
report entitled ``Towards a New Higher Education Landscape: Meeting the
Equity, Quality, Social Development Imperatives of South Africa in the 21st
century'' which was released in June 2000.

This national plan establishes indicative targets for the size and shape of
the higher education system, including overall growth and participation
rates, institutional and programme mixes, equity and efficiency goals. It
also provides a framework and outlines processes and mechanisms for the
restructuring of the institutional landscape of the higher education
system.

The DP regards the plan as a balanced and considered response to the
realities of higher education systems on the one hand, and the imperative
of restructuring and transformation on the other. The plan puts in place a
framework with clear targets and makes purposeful recommendations in terms
of policy implementation, taking the national process beyond the stages of
policy formulation. It is pleasing to note that the chief executive officer
of the SA Universities Vice-Chancellors' Association, comments favourably
on the plan. I quote him as follows:


  The plan addresses many of the concerns of the universities' responses to
  the Council of Higher Education report, as it builds on the strength of
  that report and reverts strongly to the policy recommendations contained
  in the White Paper. The plan offers a carefully considered pathway for
  higher education into the future.

The rejection of the set of mergers and combinations as suggested by the
higher education report is welcome. The link between funding and graduate
numbers is an incentive for greater teaching efficiency and the formation
and support of carefully conceptualised academic development programmes. It
is expected that these will translate into better contributions, which is a
concrete commitment to realise meaningful, increased participation and
broader access, about which we are so much concerned. Yet, there is a
danger that using funding exclusively as a means to enforce the attainment
of certain outcomes may seriously compromise academic standards.

An area of anticipated concern by the DP, which the hon the Minister
anticipated and which was also articulated the SA Universities Vice-
Chancellors' Association, relates to the issue of constitutional autonomy.
While the DP acknowledges the importance of public accountability, we feel
that the issue of autonomy requires a more complex and empathetic approach
in order to work out a workable solution to these issues.

There is also a need to develop sufficient capacity in the department in
order to sustain the system. The plan now provides clear guidelines for the
rolling plans. Previous attempts at implementing institutional rolling
plans have not been entirely successful largely because of capacity
limitation. Ways will have to be found to assist institutions in this
regard.

We have reservations about the timeframes that are - good as they are in
themselves as a matter of principle - attached to these targets. The
multiple targets and timeframes as they stand are very ambitious. A rethink
on these issues by the department and the institutions concerned may be
necessary. Overall, the plan provides a plan for achieving greater
efficiency and effectiveness within the system. However, there is a need
for more interaction between the Ministry and the institutions.

Finally, there is also a dire need to improve the quality of our school
system, especially the quality of matric results, to sustain the necessary
transformation of higher education. In the past year, for example, only
about 900 black matric students passed higher grade mathematics and science
with a C or better symbol which is the minimum requirement, as we all know,
for admission into the university faculties of engineering and science. At
this pace we are not going to achieve the balance needed in terms of
graduates in the various faculties and fields to create a balanced number
of graduates. Yes, indeed, I accept that there was an improvement, but we
have to keep on striving for excellence in education. [Applause.]

Prof L B G NDABANDABA: Mr Chairperson, hon members, hon Minister and His
Excellency the Deputy President, in the view of the IFP, this plan is the
way to academic excellence. When launching this plan on 5 March 2001 the
hon the Minister said that the reform of our higher education is long
overdue. We agree with that.

The National Plan for Higher Education addresses, in our view, the
following question: How can South Africa best use its limited resources to
get value for money so that our educational system can meet our national
goals? It sets out details and strategies for the reconfiguration of the
higher education landscape, as the Minister has outlined. The Minister has
also assured us that the plan is the surest way to abolish the dual
nationhood that apartheid left us with in this country.

The proposals in the national plan are forward-looking, in our view. I will
not give a litany of all those, but mention only a few. They are: to
provide access to higher education to all; to promote equality of access
and to redress past inequalities; to ensure diversity in the organisational
and institutional landscape of higher education; and to build high-level
research capacity to address the research and knowledge needs of South
Africa. This is crucial. Other highlights of the plan include the
following: to produce graduates needed for social and economic development
in South Africa.

The Ministry wants to establish targets as part of a three-year planning
process for graduate output. This will increase the number of graduates. I
say to the hon the Minister that we have diarised this period of three
years and we shall pose questions after three years. The national plan
proposes that the participation rate should also be increased through
recruiting workers.

Even though the demographic composition of the student body is changing and
is starting to reflect the composition of the population, equity of access
still remains a problem. Black and women students are underrepresented in
business, commerce, science, engineering, etc. The national Department of
Education has been talking about plans to recruit matriculants who have
achieved good marks in order to award them scholarships. This will help
matriculants from disadvantaged and rural areas. In historically white
universities, black staff still constitute only 5% of the staff components
of the institutions. Thus, this plan is very very welcome.

A single dedicated distance education institution will be established
through the merger of the University of SA (Unisa) and Technikon RSA, and
the incorporation of the distance education centre of Vista. We hope that
the working group which is working on this will do a good job. One of the
issues that needs to be looked into when establishing the single distance
education institution is that of accessibility. Most rural areas remain
without higher education institutions. This means that people who live in
rural areas will continue to struggle in terms of getting access to a
decent education, including libraries.

The Ministry proposes that it will continue to regard technikons as
institutions whose primary functions are to offer diplomas. This is a bit
worrying to technikons who regard themselves as universities of technology
and offer degrees such as B Tech, M Tech and D Tech.

The Ministry will replace the existing guidelines for registration of
private higher education with regulations. There is an increase in the
number of private higher education institutions in this country. The plan
is therefore most welcome. Some of these institutions often close down
after a few years in operation thus leaving students with incomplete
diplomas and degrees, and often with loans from the banks. Regulating the
registration of these institutions will protect students from those
institutions which are doing this for profit and not for academic
development. Several mergers between institutions have been authorised and
several factors were, of course, taken into consideration in this process,
including competition from foreign and multinational institutions.

In conclusion, there is no doubt that the National Plan for Higher
Education provides a framework needed to redress the past inequities. I
concur with Prof Douglas Irvine, who also supports this, and I quote him:


  In the face of global competition and the opportunities offered by new
  technologies, business everywhere is being forced to rethink strategies,
  operating structures and relations with higher education.

He goes on to state that business has a real interest in the future of
higher education in South Africa. The most ominous sign of trouble is a
declining national participation rate in higher education, which is now
developing, thus leading to a situation which is not so palatable.

A serious concern is that research output has also declined since 1994.
About 65% of recognised research publications are produced by only six of
the 21 universities which also produce 70% of the country's doctoral and
masters' degrees. That is why we support the plan. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, before I
recognise Ms Mothoagae, allow me to express my indebtedness to you for
complying with the rules of the House and making the position of the Chair
so easy today. Secondly, I think that I must particularly express a double
indebtedness to the hon Mr Momberg, because the only side of my ear that is
being assaulted today is on the side of that left portion there.
[Interjections.] Apart from that it is very good. Thirdly, allow me to
commend Ms Mothoagae on her splendid attire. Being an arts and science man,
I wish to commend her example to the rest of the House.

Ms P K MOTHOAGAE: Mr Chairperson, hon Deputy President, hon Minister and
members of the House, I think the tabling of this report on the national
plan brings to an end the miles, if not kilometres, covered since the
Freedom Charter was adopted at the congress of the people on 26 June 1955.
The objective expressed in the clauses ``the doors of learning and culture
shall be open'' and ``higher education and training shall be open to all by
all means of state allowance and scholarships awarded on merit'' has been
achieved today.

Allow me to quote from the new Agenda, the South African Journal on Social
and Economic Policy, Issue No 2/2001. The article is entitled: ``The Higher
Education Experience in Sub-Saharan Africa: Lessons to be Learned'' and is
written by Nahas Nangula. Dr Josuf is being quoted here, and I quote:


  The African university must be one that draws its inspiration from its
  environment; not a transplanted tree, but growing from a seed that is
  planted and nurtured in the African soil. It must be more than an
  institution for teaching, research and dissemination of higher learning.
  It must be accountable and serve the vast majority of the people who live
  in the rural areas. The African university must be committed to achieve,
  through active participation in the social transformation, economic
  modernisation, training and upgrading of the total human resource of the
  nation, not just a small elite.

The plan, as tabled, unpack the whole question that Dr Josuf is talking
about. Minister Kader Asmal has outlined the whole process of consultation
up to this debate today. When we talk equity and redress we are not talking
about it only in words. There is some funding that is supposed to go with
it.

The fragmentation that we found in the system was further complicated post-
1994 when black students moved to historically white institutions; the
competition between the institutions increased and racial diversity was one
of the problems encountered. Enrolment impacted negatively on the
historically black institutions. There was a lowering of standards, as the
hon member has just said.

The reality of the matter is that the 36 public institutions - categorised
as historically advantaged and historically disadvantaged - which have been
inherited from the past, are all South African institutions and must be
embraced as such. They must be transformed and put to work for and on
behalf of all South Africans as the Commission on Higher Education has
reported.

It is unfortunate that the hon Mfundisi is concerned that academic
standards will be compromised. As I indicated, redressing funding has been
one of the issues that this ANC-led overnment made its business, so that
when we talk in terms of redressing, we talk of money. It was unfortunate
that the money allocated was, most of the time, used in the already
distressed institutions.

And with redress we are not only talking institutional redress, but we are
talking social redress, which includes students' financial aid. This House
passed an Act last year to facilitate that, so that our learners should be
prepared. This cuts across the past division between black and white
institutions.

We had the earmarked funding, which we hardly talk about in this House,
which was introduced in the 2000-01 financial year. This was allocated to
enable institutions to introduce or offer extended curricula in key subject
areas, as a means of improving access and success rates for students from
disadvantaged backgrounds.

Assessments of the proposals submitted by institutions to access this
funding, it is reported, was worrying. Half of the institutions submitted
proposals that fell far short of meeting the key criteria areas. The one
highlighted among them is that foundation programmes are not effectively
integrated into the mainstream curricula and provide places for students
who do not need admission criteria, thus resulting in higher failure rates
and more dropouts. However, with the assurance that is being given, this
plan is going to be re-evaluated as we go along, I hope, and we are going
to achieve our goals.

The funding formula, which the hon the Minister referred to, will be phased
in at least by the year 2003.

[Allow me to speak in Setswana, because the topic that we are discussing
today is not only for professors, doctors and those who speak English, but
also affects those who only speak Setswana at home. It has been shown that
there are only a small number of physically disabled women in those
institutions of learning. I was hoping that Ms Taljaard would be here
today. I was going to tell her that she must speak to the veteran in their
party, Ms Dene Smuts. I have never heard them speaking about women or
women's organisations. I am saying that we should discuss this topic with
this in mind.]

The female of the species is an endangered species in these higher
institutions of learning.

numbers could increase, because the lower-grade schools that we have been
talking about - preprimary, primary and highschools - should produce
quality pupils who are acceptable to institutions of higher learning,
because when they are not of this quality ... [Time expired.]]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Mr Chairperson, the hon the Minister made a very
unfortunate remark when he addressed the House. He said the purpose of
distance education was to keep black students away from contact
institutions. That is not true. Practical reasons, and only practical
reasons, determine whether a student, black or white, makes use of distance
education.

In Beeld het 'n berig onder die volgende opskrif verskyn: ``Castro se lang
asem laat Asmal uiltjie knip''. [In Beeld an article appeared under the
following heading: ``Castro's lengthy speech causes Asmal to catch forty
winks.'']
This means that Asmal took a nap during Castro's long-winded speech. The
Minister must rest assured that nobody in his or her right mind will blame
him for having fallen asleep, as long as he is awake and watchful with
regard to the future of higher education in South Africa.

I say that the aims of the National Plan for Higher Education are
admirable, but the way in which the Minister wants to implement the plan is
questionable and raises serious concerns. The aim to ensure that the
participation rate in higher education increases overall, especially in the
fields of business, commerce, science, engineering and technology, is
admirable.

Unfortunately, the Minister is putting the cart before the horse.
Enrolments in business, science and maths will only increase if the school
system delivers enough students with matriculation exemption in these
subjects. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: I said so, I said so!

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Yes, but the Minister must first lay the foundation and
then put the roof on. Currently they do not. Last year 3 000 students got
an exemption in mathematics, which is unsatisfactory, and the participation
rate in higher education will only increase once the school system has been
overhauled and improved. [Interjections.]

The aim to increase graduate outputs is also admirable. Graduate outputs,
however, cannot be linked to funding or subsidies, as envisaged in the
plan. This will inevitably, for obvious reasons, lead to the lowering of
standards, as institutions will simply turn out graduates in order to
ensure ongoing funding.

It is pointless to try to increase graduate outputs, on the one hand, while
on the other graduates and highly educated people are leaving the country
at a rate ranking amongst the highest in the world, mainly due to draconian
labour laws, reverse discrimination and rampant crime. Of the 19 000
members of the SA Institute of Chartered Accountants, 4 000, or nearly 22%,
were living abroad at the end of the year 2000, and some research suggests
that emigration has cost South Africa R8,4 billion in lost income tax and a
further R285 billion in potential contributions to the GDP.

This shows how wrong Adv Gumbi, law adviser to the President, was when she
said ``people who are leaving the country are racists with no confidence in
a black Government, and whose departure is no loss at all''. She should be
reprimanded for this irresponsible statement. The Government should do
everything in its power to keep graduates in the country.

The recruitment of academics from the rest of the African continent in
order to establish equity in staff compositions could be supported,
provided that such recruitment emanates from bilateral agreements between
South Africa and the countries involved. President Mbeki recently indicated
that 250 000 African professionals were currently working in the United
States and Europe. South Africa should not aggravate the situation by
poaching academics from Africa. The hon the Minister was himself very
vociferous in his condemnation of consultants from Britain trying to
recruit local teachers. Recruitment of academics from the African continent
should, therefore, be handled with caution.

The restructuring of the institutional landscape of the higher education
system in order to eliminate duplication and to promote diversity is also a
positive step. We have confidence in the working group appointed by the
Minister to make recommendations on possible mergers. But we strongly urge
the hon the Minister to consult with institutions that may be affected by
possible mergers before taking a final decision, despite the fact that he,
once again, ruled out such a possibility. A final round of consultations
with those institutions will hurt nobody.

The whole concept of diversity should not only apply to academic
programmes, but also to institutional identities based on either language,
culture or religion. In this regard, allow me to ask the Minister a
specific question. Under the heading: ``Collaboration and Institutional
Identities'', the national plan states: ``This is not to imply that
institutional identities, real or imagined, can be wished away''. Now, does
this mean, for example, that a university can define itself in terms of
culture, language or religion without forfeiting state subsidies? To put it
quite bluntly: Will it be possible in future for the University of
Potchefstroom to define itself in terms of its Christian roots?

Met ander woorde, sal die Universiteit van Potchefstroom steeds as die PU
vir CHO, Potchefstroomse Universiteit vir Christelike Hoër Onderwys kan
bekend staan? [In other words, will the University of Potchefstroom still
be known as the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education?]

Will it be possible for a university to define itself as an Afrikaans
university? The language issue had dominated the debate on the National
Plan for Higher Education because the only reference to language in the
plan was made in the form of a threat. It stated quite clearly that
language ``may not stand in the way of any student to study at an
institution of higher education''.

Die Nuwe NP en die DA verwelkom die aanstelling van prof Jakes Gerwel as
voorsitter van 'n werkgroep wat aanbevelings gaan doen oor die taalkwessie.
[The New NP and the DA welcome the appointment of Prof Jakes Gerwel as
chairperson of a study group which will make recommendations on the
language issue.]

The Minister also announced the rest of the team, and we have confidence in
it. Prof Willie Esterhuizen is on the team and he initiated it at
Stellenbosch. And if one would like to consult somebody on initiation, one
can consult him. [Interjections.]

Die Nuwe NP wil een ding egter baie duidelik beklemtoon. Die voortbestaan
van Afrikaans as onderrigtaal aan inrigtings vir hoër onderwys binne die
raamwerk van meertaligheid mag nie in die slag bly of aangetas word nie. Ek
wil herhaal dat die bevordering van inheemse tale as wetenskap- en
onderrigtale in 'n nuwe bedeling voorrang moet geniet. Aan die ander kant
durf Afrikaans sy verworwe status as wetenskaptaal wat deur die Grondwet
gewaarborg word, nie verloor nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[The New NP would, however, want to emphasise one thing very clearly: The
continued existence of Afrikaans as a language of instruction at
institutions for higher education within the framework of multilingualism
should not fall victim to or be affected by this. I want to repeat that the
promotion of indigenous languages as science languages and languages of
instruction should enjoy preference in a new dispensation. On the other
hand, Afrikaans should not lose its gained status as a science language
which is guaranteed by the Constitution.]

In conclusion, the aims of the plan are admirable, but in the final
analysis, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. [Applause.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, Deputy President, Ministers and colleagues,
the National Plan for Higher Education represents a bold step in the right
direction for Government policy.

Meeting the equity, quality and social development imperatives of South
Africa in ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Quite a number of members are
standing in the aisles. Please take your seats. Carry on, hon member.

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, meeting the equity, quality and social
development imperatives of South Africa in the 21st century is indeed a
noble course. I agree with the goals of the plan and most of the proposals
for achieving the following goals, reflected innovations and creativity.
Gradually increasing the participation rate is correct, whilst recognising
that in the short to medium-term, the focus should be on improving
efficiency with increased graduation outputs. The funding of academic
development programmes has been problematic, contributing to low
participation and graduation rates. The proposed new funding formula, as
well as the review of the National Students' Financial Aid Scheme, are both
long overdue, and I welcome this. Ditto with regard to the recruiting of
participation and recruitment to include previously neglected sectors of
society, such as women, the disabled people and workers.

The proposed new overall focus on ensuring that all enrolments are equipped
with skills of the new economy and technology cannot be faulted. In short,
the higher education plan is welcomed. It is a fresh breeze in a debate
that has gone stale in recent years.

There is at this stage only one matter of great concern to me. I refer to
the issue of the possible restructuring of African or black universities
out of existence. The UDM urgently appeals to the Minister to consider this
matter afresh. I appreciate that considerable thinking has preceded the
suggestions contained in the plan, and note the proposed establishment of a
national working group to investigate this matter. However, I feel morally
obliged to raise certain concerns.

I urge the hon the Minister to remember the historic context of the former
so-called African/black universities. It is undeniable that these
institutions have made a considerable contribution to the liberation of our
country by nurturing and developing African leadership in times of great
oppression and upheaval. South Africa could hardly have attained its
political miracle without these institutions.

For many decades, these institutions were the only avenue for the
previously disadvantaged to acquire skills. Many people from other African
countries also acquired their skills at these institutions, returning to
their homes to rebuild what colonialism, dictatorship and civil war had
destroyed. The rebuilding of South Africa in the past seven years would not
have been possible without the skills taught at these institutions. Many of
the great reformers of the past few years, including numerous members of
this House, studied at these institutions. In fact, I recognise several of
my ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Mr Chairperson, hon Deputy President, hon Ministers and hon
members, we have entered the 21st century with a huge backlog in education
development, meaning that a large portion of our population is ill-equipped
for the current job market.

The National Plan for Higher Education correctly states, however, that
``knowledge and the processing of information'' are the key driving forces
for wealth creation and socioeconomic development. So we support this
statement. In order to make this happen, certain infrastructural changes to
higher education institutions will have to occur. Historically, South
Africa's education was divided along racial lines and inequality. This is a
historic fact, and yet, despite all these many disadvantages, many South
Africans managed to obtain good qualifications at our universities, despite
the many obstacles in their way, such as the quota system.

However, we are ill-equipped as a nation for the new millennium.
Incidentally, I discovered this when I visited Atlanta in the US. I found
that there were so many black females who were highly qualified and in key
positions. That brought reality home to me that in South Africa we really
need to get our act together.

Now, the National Plan for Higher Education has noble objectives. Any
transformation that might lead to the improvement of our higher education
system will be welcomed and supported by the ACDP. So, we do not have
arguments against the objectives: increased access to higher education for
all - who can argue against that equity of access to all institutions of
higher learning is a noble one; to address the research and knowledge needs
of our nation is correct, and ensuring regional collaboration of
institutions of higher learning is good.

In conclusion, although we support this and there are so many merits that
we are mindful of, perhaps we should bring to the attention of the Minister
the issue of constitutional autonomy of universities. How are we going to
do that and not interfere with the autonomy of universities? Is that not an
important issue that needs to be addressed?

Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairperson, Alfred Milner was not a real Englishman,
but he was more English than the English trying to destroy Afrikaans. Mr
Asmal is not a real Englishman, but the question is: Is he a second Alfred
Milner, or not? [Interjections.] I know the Minister said ``no'', but I am
going to test him. [Laughter.]

The Minister said that there was not a shred of evidence that Government
wanted to act against Afrikaans universities. [Interjections.] I welcome
it. Mr Asmal seemed not to be a second Milner but, in the next sentence, he
says: ``They may not use language to keep students away. Language may not
be a barrier to students.'' With that point of departure, the Minister is
killing Afrikaans as a language of instruction. Why? Because the number of
students that prefer English and the cost of providing parallel instruction
will slowly force all Afrikaans universities to use English alone as a
language of instruction.

There are no such demands on English institutions. What is happening with
most Afrikaans schools in rural areas? They have become schools with
parallel instruction and then the Afrikaans instruction is stopped and
small children of six years go to a hostel 200 km away. That is the reality
out there.

Wat is die posisie ten opsigte van Afrikaanse universiteite? Suid-Afrika
het 21 universiteite waarvan 5 tradisioneel Afrikaans was. Wat bedoel ons
as ons praat van 'n Afrikaanse universiteit? Natuurlik kan alles nie in
Afrikaans wees. Kom ons praat van die universiteit wat Afrikaans-dominant
is as 'n taal van onderrig. Die VF glo net soos AZAPO dat Suid-Afrika se
Afrikatale ook nog as universiteitstale ontwikkel moet word.

By al vyf hierdie universiteite is Engels reeds die dominante taal vir alle
nagraadse kursusse. By drie van hulle is Afrikaans en Engels reeds
parallel; slegs twee is nog Afrikaans. Die proses is reeds besig om
geleidelik Afrikaans te vernietig. Die VF het gevra vir twee universiteite
en ons ongewild gemaak na buite omdat ons dit so afskaal. Die Minister kan
gaan kyk na enige ``international charter on minority rights'' en ...
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[What is the position with regard to the Afrikaans universities? South
Africa has 21 universities, 5 of which were traditionally Afrikaans. What
do we mean when we speak of an Afrikaans university? Of course everything
cannot be in Afrikaans. Let us talk about the university that has Afrikaans
as its predominant language of instruction. The FF believes, just like
AZAPO, that the African languages of South Africa must also still be
developed as university languages.

At all five of these universities English is already the dominant language
for all postgraduate courses. At three of them Afrikaans and English are
already parallel languages; only two are still Afrikaans. This process is
already steadily destroying Afrikaans. We in the FF asked for two
universities and made ourselves unpopular among the public because we were
scaling them down to such an extent. The Minister can take a look at any
``international charter on minority rights'' and ...]

... the right to education up to tertiary level is one of those basic
rights. That means active steps must be taken by the majority to protect
the minority. Is the Minister willing to take active steps to protect
Afrikaans? Otherwise, it is all over. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, you have been
giving me great co-operation, but I do appreciate that some of you are
becoming restive. May we call you back to order? [Interjections.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Mr Chairperson, the advent of democracy has placed demands
on all who are involved in education. Higher education is no exception.
Technikons seem to be the most afraid of the envisaged plans when one takes
into account statements made by the heads of Technikon North West and
Technikon South Africa.

South African students should have an equal chance of access to higher
education. To attain this, measures have to be taken to make funds
available to those who do not have. Such access could also be enhanced by
the proposed broadening of the social base of students. Centres of higher
education should not depend entirely on certificates with regard to
workers, mature learners and the disabled. Working experience could count
in the favour of this category of persons.

Pronouncements made by Government to the effect that mainly students who
follow courses in science, mathematics and information technology should
take precedence for admission have resulted in a drop in enrolments in
other disciplines such as the arts. The result is that the study of
languages is taking a back seat. The greatest victims are African languages
and culture. This should not be allowed if we wish to promote the African
Renaissance. African languages for the peoples of Africa should be the
mainstay of the rebirth of Africa.

The UCDP argues that restructuring the higher education system does not
mean anglicising it. We look forward to the day when our universities and
technikons will offer programmes in some African language from first year
to doctoral level. Any failure to realise this could mean that the colonial
mentality has won the day.

The envisaged desirability and feasibility by the Council on Higher
Education of introducing four-year undergraduate degrees was done with
great success, way back in 1980, by what is now called the University of
the North West. It is a matter of when this is done and not whether it can
be done by the other universities.

It is unfortunate that the National Students' Financial Aid Scheme cannot
cover more students. This does not help the situation of deserving
students. The fact that institutions tend to give funding to those
following the so-called rare subjects does not help the situation either.
While the UCDP supports the restructuring of higher education, we will keep
on saying: Mr Minister, cothoza [do not hurry] in that direction.

Dr J BENJAMIN: Mr Chairperson, I am going to speak in my mother tongue,
which is Afrikaans.

Hierdeur steek ek 'n hand van vriendskap uit na dr Mulder van die VF en al
my mede-Afrikaanssprekende Suid-Afrikaners. Die punt wat ek wil maak, is
dat Afrikaans ver van verdwyn is. Dit is aan die toeneem. Wees gerus.

Die meeste tersiêre instellings het die nasionale tersiêre opvoedingsplan
verwelkom. Prof Coetzee van die Vrystaatse Universiteit is hoogs tevrede
met die missiegedrewe- en nisprogrambenadering. Volgens prof Reinecke van
die Potchefstroomse Universiteit getuig die program van realisme en prof
Dennis van Rensburg, rektor van Technikon Pretoria, sê die program stel
groot uitdagings aan hoër onderwys en verder bied dit goeie geleenthede vir
instellings om hul ``nismarkte'' uit te brei.

Dié program dra by tot die kennis en menslike hulpbronne wat die land nodig
het. Vir my is dit ooglopend hoe hierdie program wegbeweeg van die
apartheidgesprek en positiewer en proaktiewer vooruitgang maak.

Plaas van konsentreer op etniese en kulturele verskeidenheid, praat ons
hier van institusionele verskeidenheid. Omvorming word gedryf deur die
programme van instellings te evalueer volgens die kriteria wat befondsing
bepaal. Hierdie kriteria word deur missies en doelwitte bepaal wat in die
witskrif vervat is en wat sowel die verskeidenheid onder studente as die
behoeftes ten opsigte van die ontwikkeling van menslike hulpbronne in ag
neem.

Wie kan dan nog teen so 'n plan gekant wees, behalwe dié wat nog steeds
soos volstruise hul kop in die sand druk? Die agb lid adv Gaum, indien
Beeld hom reg aanhaal, het gemaan dat rasionalisering op streekvlak
implikasies kan hê vir die onderrigtaal by sommige instellings.

Weer eens probeer iemand politieke wins maak deur etniese gevoelens op te
sweep. Hierdie vrees dat Afrikaners hul taal as onderrigmedium sal moet
prysgee, word natuurlik genoem in teenstelling met die grootskaalse inname
van swart studente en die druk op instellings om oor te skakel na
tweetalige onderrig om swart studente te akkommodeer. Dit is kommerwekkend
dat swart studente hul grootliks by Afrikaanse tersiêre instellings
inskryf. Nieteenstaande bly die studentemassa meestal wit, terwyl die swart
massas op afstandkampusse beland.

Dit is egter die minderheid Afrikaanssprekendes wat nou nog huil oor die
statusverlies van Afrikaans in die regering, administrasie, regstelsel,
wetenskappe, en handel en nywerheid. Die breë Afrikaanssprekende
gemeenskap, die meer as 15 miljoen eerste-, tweede- en derdetaalsprekers
juig, want hulle sien Afrikaans as 'n groeiende kommunikasiemiddel wat
belangrik is vir handel, nywerheid en finansiële instellings. Hierdie
progressiewe Afrikaanssprekendes aanvaar dat Afrikaans van sowel Europese
as Afrika-oorsprong is en nie net aan wit Afrikaners behoort nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[By doing so I am extending the hand of friendship to Dr Mulder of the FF
and all my fellow Afrikaans-speaking South Africans. The point that I want
to make is that Afrikaans is far from disappearing. It is on the increase.
Rest assured.

Most of the tertiary institutions welcomed the national tertiary education
plan. Prof Coetzee of Free State University is highly satisfied with the
mission-driven and niche programme approach. According to Prof Reinecke of
Potchefstroom University the programme attests to realism and Prof Dennis
van Rensburg, rector of the Pretoria Technikon, says that the programme
poses great challenges to higher education and furthermore affords sound
opportunities for institutions to extend their ``niche markets''.

This programme contributes to the knowledge and human resources that the
country needs. The way that this programme is moving away from the
apartheid discussion and making more positive and proactive progress is
obvious to me.

Instead of concentrating on ethnic and cultural diversity, here we are
talking about institutional diversity. Transformation is driven by the
evaluation of programmes of institutions in terms of the criteria that
determine financing. These criteria are determined by missions and
objectives that are contained in the White Paper and that take into
consideration the diversity of students as well as the requirements in
respect of the development of human resources.

Who could then still be opposed to such a plan, except those who are still
hiding their heads in the sand like ostriches? The hon member Adv Gaum, if
Beeld quoted him correctly, warned that rationalisation at the regional
level could have implications for the language of instruction at certain
institutions.

Someone is once again trying to score political points by inciting ethnic
emotions. This fear that Afrikaners will have to give up their language as
a medium of instruction is mentioned, of course, against the background of
the large-scale admission of black students and the pressure on
institutions to change over to bilingual teaching to accommodate black
students. It is disconcerting that black students largely enrol at
Afrikaans tertiary institutions. Nevertheless the students remain mostly
white, while the black masses end up on distance campuses.

It is the minority of Afrikaans-speaking people, however, who are still
bemoaning the loss of status of Afrikaans in government, administration,
the judicial system, the sciences and trade and industry. The broader
Afrikaans-speaking community, the more than 15 million first, second and
third-language speakers, are rejoicing, because they see Afrikaans as a
growing means of communication which is important to trade, industry and
financial institutions. These progressive Afrikaans-speaking people accept
that Afrikaans is of European as well as African origin, and does not
belong to white Afrikaners only.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mr Chairman ...

Dr J BENJAMIN: Maar niemand huil oor die verlies van status wat hulle voel
... [But no one is bemoaning the loss of status that they feel ...]

Dr C P MULDER: Mr Chairman ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, hon member. Are you rising on a
point of order?

Dr C P MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, terwyl die agb lid baie tyd het, wil ek
haar vra of sy bereid sal wees om 'n baie maklike vraag te beantwoord? [Mr
Chairman, since the hon member has a great deal of time, I want to ask her
whether she would be prepared to take a very easy question.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, will you take a question?

Dr J BENJAMIN: Mnr die Voorsitter, sodra ek klaar is. Ek sal miskien my
toespraak afhandel voordat my tyd verstreke is. [Mr Chairperson, as soon as
I have finished. I might conclude my speech before my time expires.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek sal wag daarvoor, dankie. [Mr
Chairman, I shall wait for that, thank you.]

Dr J BENJAMIN: Dankie. [Thank you.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you.

Dr J BENJAMIN: Sommige Afrikaanssprekendes bied teenstand. Hulle huil oor
die verlies van status en bied weerstand teen omvorming. Dit is hierdie
weerstand teen omvorming waarteen die Minister hom uitspreek wanneer hy sê
taal is steeds die grootste struikelblok vir swart studente om toegang tot
histories wit Afrikaanse instellings te kry.

Die plan konsentreer nie net op die inskryf van studente nie, maar ook op
die uitkoms van onderrig. Dit maak dus nie sin om taal vir
identiteitsdoeleindes te gebruik nie, maar wel as kommunikeermiddel. Sonder
dat Afrikaans vandag in mense se kele afgedruk word, groei die taal ten
opsigte van gemeenskaps- en kulturele produkte - dit is sekerlik 'n beter
manier om 'n taal te bou.

Dit is interessant dat alle instellings hul planne wil skoei op een soort
instelling, die Oxbridge-soort model, wat deur groot navorsingsinstellings
verteenwoordig word. Weer eens is dit die koloniale erfenis wat tevore
groter befondsing vir navorsing en kleiner befondsing vir onderwysprogramme
gekry het.

Die departement het nie met vorige voorstelle saamgestem om tussen
navorsing en onderwysinstellings te differensieer nie. Die meeste
instellings het 'n nisprogrambenadering verkies omdat elkeen sodoende 'n
eie nismark kon vind. Die nasionale tersiêre opvoedingsplan is 'n praktiese
benadering tot verandering.

Dit toon volwassenheid onder ons tersiêre instellings, asook 'n
bewuswording dat, tensy ons die meerderheid oplei om tot hul volle
potensiaal te ontwikkel, ons en ons nageslag die gelag sal moet betaal,
want ons sal sit met 'n nasie waarvan die meerderheid arm en minderwaardig
is.

Ek het nog sewe sekondes oor vir 'n vraag.

Dr C P MULDER: Dankie! Mnr die Voorsitter, die agb lid is reeds 'n
gerespekteerde en senior lid in haar party, ook wat die onderwyskomitee
betref, en sê ons moet ons nie bekommer oor Afrikaans en die pad vorentoe
nie. Nou wil ek vir die agb lid vra, wanneer my kind oor vier of vyf jaar
universiteit toe moet gaan, kan die agb lid vandag vir die Afrikaner en die
Afrikaanssprekendes daar buite die versekering gee dat my kind
universiteitsopleiding in Afrikaans sal kan kry, ja of nee?
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr J BENJAMIN: Some Afrikaans-speaking people are resisting. They bemoan
the loss of status and resist transformation. This is the resistance to
transformation which the Minister expressed himself as being opposed to
when he said that language was still the greatest stumbling block to black
students' gaining admission to historically white institutions.

The plan concentrates not only on the admission of students, but also on
the outcome of training. It therefore makes no sense to use language for
purposes of identity, but one should in fact do so as a means of
communication. Without Afrikaans being forced down the throats of people
today, the language is growing in respect of community and cultural
products - this is certainly a better way of building a language.

It is interesting that all institutions want to base their plans on one
type of institution, the Oxbridge type of model, which is represented by
large research institutions. It is once again the colonial heritage which
previously received more financing for research and less financing for
educational programmes.

The department did not agree with previous proposals to differentiate
between research and educational institutions. Most institutions preferred
a niche programme approach, because each of them could in this way find an
individual niche market. The national tertiary education plan is a
practical approach to transformation.

It displays maturity among our tertiary institutions, as well as an
emerging awareness that unless we train the majority to develop to their
full potential we and our descendants will have to pay the price, because
we will end up with a nation of which the majority is poor and inferior.

I have seven seconds left for a question.

Dr C P MULDER: Thank you. Mr Chairman, the hon member is already a
respected and senior member of her party, also in respect of the education
committee, and she says that we should not be concerned about Afrikaans and
the road ahead. Now I want to ask the hon member, when my child has to go
to university in four or five years' time, whether the hon member can give
the Afrikaner and Afrikaans-speaking people out there the assurance today
that my child will be able to receive a university education in Afrikaans,
yes or no? [Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, I will give you an extra
minute to answer.

Dr J BENJAMIN: Mr Chairperson, an extra minute?

Mnr die Voorsitter, ek hoop die agb lid se kind praat nie net Afrikaans in
'n land waar daar 12 tale is nie. My kind, en ons almal se kinders, moet
leer om met ander te kommunikeer. Die meeste van ons kan drie, vier, vyf
tale praat. Ongelukkig kan ek net een of twee praat. Die antwoord is,
hopelik, ja. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr Chairperson, I hope that the hon member's child does not speak only
Afrikaans in a country in which there are 12 languages. My child, and the
children of all of us, should learn to communicate with others. Most of us
can speak three, four, five languages. Unfortunately I can speak only one
or two. The answer is, hopefully, yes. [Applause.]]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, for a developing country such as ours ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Proceed, hon member.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, for a developing country such as ours, an
excellent education system is an absolute imperative. We have clearly
inherited an education system that is complex and gives the appearance of
being advanced and multifaceted whilst it is inadequate in meeting the
needs of the majority of our people. Rationalisation is critical to avoid
duplication and confusion. The next thing, after accepting this principle,
is to strive for consensus after extensive consultation. Respect for the
individuality of historical and cultural peculiarities should characterise
the exercise.

Where institutions serve the same geographic area, they may have to merge,
but higher ideals should be enunciated. Institutions with historic
character should be preserved, perhaps in name. A good example is Fort
Hare, which has trained leaders in Africa far beyond our borders and has
held the torch of education during the dark ages. If Rhodes, Port
Elizabeth, Fort Hare and Unitra were to merge to form a larger university,
such a conglomerate should be called Fort Hare, but the individual
component campuses should retain their names. Likewise, Pretoria
University, Wits and RAU could form a medical university but it could be
called Medunsa. Other possible formations can be constructed around the
Cape Town, Stellenbosch, Natal, Potchefstroom and Free State Universities.

Universities must not be so large that they become amorphous and
characterless. After the initial rationalisation the institutions of higher
education should justify their existence. No institution should be propped
up. Those that have a propensity to fall or die should be allowed to die
gracefully. After a suitable funeral, they should become history.
[Interjections.] [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, you should talk to
the hon Momberg about getting more time.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the Minister, Deputy President and hon
members, the MF believes that knowledge definitely equals power, and
education is certainly the key to knowledge. In the apartheid era the
masses were dealt an unjust blow when it came to education and were
deprived of an equal status in all spheres of their lives. However, in
postapartheid South Africa, further steps are being undertaken to remedy
past ills and provide for equally accessible education for every
individual, irrespective of colour or creed.

The MF commends Education Minister Kader Asmal for introducing the National
Plan for Higher Education which, in keeping with the third White Paper,
focuses on establishing a single national co-ordinated system which will
meet the learning needs of citizens as well as cater for the needs of our
society's economy. The National Plan for Higher Education aims to create a
balance in the ratio of black and white students that are admitted to
tertiary institutions, as well as to create balance in the ratio of
students that are admitted in different faculties.

There is also a dire need for institutions to provide courses that are
affordable and user friendly, so as to increase the rate of students that
attend tertiary institutions as well as to increase the pass rate level of
graduates and postgraduate students. It is commendable to note that the
national plan aims to ensure that all graduates are equipped with computer
and adequate growth skills, since there is a limited number of individuals
in this technological field. This will in turn create a boost in the
economy.

The MF fully supports the National Plan for Higher Education and is hopeful
that it will provide a stepping stone to success for the youth of tomorrow,
as well as the ambitious citizens of our society. [Time expired.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I would like to remind hon members of
a Rule of this House which states that members should speak, rather than
read their speeches. It helps a great deal for the order in the House if
members address themselves to hon members. So I would like hon members to
take note of this Rule of the House.

Mr D H M GIBSON: That Rule no longer applies. It is an old Rule.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Is it an old Rule? If it is an old
Rule, then it is no longer valid and therefore members are free to read
their speeches.

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson and hon Minister, although I was not present in
the House, I followed the hon the Minister's speech on the monitor in my
office, as I was still preparing mine. Although I do not agree with the hon
the Minister, I want to thank him for answering my motion.

Die nuwe Plan vir Hoër Onderwys het met baie omstredenheid gepaard gegaan,
miskien nie omtrent die plan self nie, maar oor uitlatings wat die Minister
terselfdertyd gemaak het, soos sy verklaring dat die taalmedium
transformasie belemmer, sowel as die moontlike bepalings oor die regulering
van bevolkingsverspreiding vir studente en personeel. Dit is dus te begrype
dat die saak van interne outonomie in gedrang kom.

Hierdie bedreiging raak in die besonder die karakter van 'n universiteit
soos Potchefstroom, waaroor ek nou verder wil praat. Potchefstroom se
Christelike karakter is in wetgewing tydens hierdie nuwe bedeling in 1998
vasgelê. Die vrees dat dié karakter in die gedrang kom, word vererger deur
die Minister se uitsprake dat 'n geloofskriterium vir personeel, en 'n
besluit deur die PUK oor die moraliteit van 'n aanbieding van Pieter-Dirk
Uys, teen die Grondwet sou wees.
As die Grondwet my reg tot godsdiensbeoefening beskerm, dan beskerm dit ook
my reg om die werklikheid en die wetenskap te beskou in die lig van my
godsdienstige oortuigings. Dit is nie diskriminasie nie, dit is my reg. Dit
is nie verideologisering nie, want dan is die gewaande beginsel van
absolute neutraliteit mos ook 'n ideologie. Aan die PUK word teen niemand
gediskrimineer nie. Inteendeel, geen student word weggewys op een van die
verbode diskriminasie-gronde van die Grondwet nie. Al wat gebeur, is dat hy
hom tydens sy onderrig aan 'n bepaalde legitieme wetenskapsbeskouing
verbind.

Indien daar van personeel verwag word om hul akademiese aktiwiteite te
beoefen in ooreenstemming met die etos van die universiteit, is dit volgens
die gelykheidswet nie onbillike diskriminasie nie, maar `` ...
differensiasie op grond van objektiewe maatstawwe, inherent aan die
aktiwiteit wat aangebied word,'' soos die wet ook lui. Daar is groot kommer
dat hierdie reg van 'n instelling wat 'n trotse geskiedenis het in Suid-
Afrika, en wat hoogstaande akademiese opleiding bied, in die gedrang kan
kom. Ek doen 'n beroep op die Minister om duidelik die reg op eie etos van
my alma mater te erken. [Tyd verstreke.]

Mnr J H MOMBERG: Moenie ``worry'' nie, ons gaan jou beskerm!

Mnr C AUCAMP: Ek glo jou. Dít maak my bekommerd! [Tussenwerpsels.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The new Plan for Higher Education has been associated with a great deal of
controversy, perhaps not about the plan itself, but about statements the
Minister made at this time, such as his statement that the language medium
is hampering transformation, as well as the possible provisions on the
regulation of population distribution for students and staff. It is
therefore understandable that the issue of internal autonomy is being
jeopardised.

This threat particularly affects the character of a university such as
Potchefstroom, which I would like to say more about. Potchefstroom's
Christian character was captured in legislation during this new
dispensation in 1998. The fear that this character could be jeopardised has
been exacerbated by the Minister's statements that a faith criterion for
staff, and a decision by the Potchefstroom University about the morality of
a presentation by Pieter-Dirk Uys, would be in violation of the
Constitution.

If the Constitution protects my right to practise religion, it then also
protects my right to view reality and science in the light of my religious
convictions. This is not discrimination, it is my right. It is not
ideologisation, because then the supposed principle of absolute neutrality
is certainly also an ideology. Nobody is being discriminated against at
Potchefstroom University. On the contrary, no student is turned away on one
of the forbidden bases of discrimination in the Constitution. All that
happens is that during his instruction he commits himself to a particular
legitimate view of science.

If staff are expected to carry out their academic activities in accordance
with the ethos of the university, in terms of the Act pertaining to
Equality this is not unreasonable discrimination, but: ``... differentiates
between persons according to objectively determinable criteria, intrinsic
to the activity concerned,'' as the Act states. There is great concern that
this right of an institution which has a proud history in South Africa and
which offers academic training of high standing, could be jeopardised. I
appeal to the Minister clearly to recognise the right to its own ethos of
my alma mater. [Time expired.]

Mr J H MOMBERG: Don't worry, we are going to protect you!

Mr C AUCAMP: I believe you. That is what worries me! [Interjections.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! On the point that I made earlier, the
hon Gibson has caught my eye and I think that he would like to inform the
House as to what the situation is. We will all be better for it.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, on a point of order: The point of order was
that Rule 62 does indeed refer to members not reading speeches. A member
shall as far as possible refrain from reading his or her speech, but may
refresh his or her memory by referring to notes. Perhaps if I could add
that if one starts applying this Rule - as it has almost been abrogated by
disuse - it will have to apply to Ministers and others as well.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The point that I wanted to make was
that if one addresses members, it does make for better audience contact and
therefore better reception.

Prof S S RIPINGA: Chairperson, hon Deputy President, hon Minister of
Education and hon members, empirical evidence confirms the ANC's view that
a single co-ordinated higher education system has the strength and immense
potential to contribute to economic and social development needs of South
Africa. We now know that our system has fundamental problems and serious
weaknesses. It is for this reason that the hon the Minister of Education
has unveiled a national plan that seeks to fix the system, meet pressing
needs and respond to new realities and opportunities in our country. We
want to commend the Ministry for this brave and brutal strategic plan.

Firstly, allow me to briefly comment on the establishment of the national
institute for higher education in Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape. The
people of Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape have waited for a long time for
a coherent code pertaining to the provision of higher education. The
geographic location of higher education institutions during the apartheid
era was based on ideological and political considerations rather than on
rational and coherent planning. This arbitrary planning resulted in
fragmentation and unnecessary duplication the excessive concentration of
higher education institutions in some regions and an absence of readily
accessible contact in certain areas of the country.

To this end, some higher education institutions were established in the
bush and in industrial areas for various ethnic groups, and others for
English and Afrikaans-speaking groups. Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape
were worst off. No contact institutions were provided for these areas. To
address this irrational ideological and manipulative planning in Mpumalanga
and the Northern Cape, the Ministry intends to establish a national
institute of higher education. This is commendable. This will serve as an
administrative and governance hub for ensuring a coherent provision of
higher education programmes, largely through programme collaboration. This
will build on existing programmes that are offered by different
institutions currently operating in the two provinces. We note with
gratitude that a working group will be established soon, to develop a
framework and an inplementation plan for the establishment of such an
institution.

Allow me to respond to some objections and reservations that have been made
by the opposition and some people outside the Chamber in respect of some
elements of the plan. Some people have raised concerns that the plan will
infringe on institutional autonomy. Some have raised concerns about the
increase in the participation rate in higher education, claiming that it
will lead to the lowering of quality or standards. They further claim that
the question of incentives will compromise quality. They also claim that
shifting the balance in enrolment between humanities, business, commerce,
science, engineering and technology from the current ratios will never be
achieved. They state that the processing of students from secondary schools
to universities will never be realised, because of the poor logistical
infrastructure and matric results, as is happening at the moment.

In respect of the impact of the plan on institutional autonomy, the hon the
Minister has already alluded to this. As the hon the Minister has already
indicated, the need for institutional autonomy is appreciated and is
granted by the Higher Education Act. However, institutional autonomy is not
absolute. The Act does not grant higher education institutions unfettered
autonomy. In fact, regarding Mr Green, I would like to bring it to his
attention that there is no constitutional autonomy, but we are talking
about institutional autonomy. The plan also refers to institutional
autonomy. Higher education institutions, therefore, are accountable to
Government and to all credible and legitimate stakeholders who depend on
the institutions.

Conservative higher education institutions' management use institutional
autonomy as an excuse to derail transformation and to perpetuate historical
privilege. Regarding the question of the plan on quality and standards,
some people associate increased participation with pass-one-pass-all. Some
people equate this whole issue of quality and standards with the question
of just pushing black university students for the sake of doing so. That is
not correct. If one looks at the White Paper and the plan itself, both say
something about quality. In other words, if one looks presently at the
combined potentially adverse effects of rising enrolment on educational and
academic standards, quality assurance has been provided for. Higher
education institutions are accountable with regard to performance
indicators that influence standards.

With regard to ``cothoza'', I do not think that we are in position to go
slow.

Ek wil vir die agb dr Geldenhuys sê ons sal nie op 'n sloerstaking gaan
nie. [I want to tell the hon Dr Geldenhuys that we will not embark on a go
slow.]

We are going to move fast to implement these measures. The time for
negotiations which were slow is over. Now we will implement.

With regard to distance education, keeping black students from contact
institutions, I think that the Minister will also say something about that.
However, with regard to the teaching of mathematics as a prerequisite for
studying in some field, I want to remind Dr Geldenhuys of the words of Dr
Verwoerd when he said: ``What is the use teaching a Bantu child mathematics
when it cannot use it?'' I urge members to note the derogatory word ``it''.
That is why we are now reaping the fruits of the malicious policies of
apartheid education. What we want to do is to reverse the balance and
encourage mathematics, science and technology to be taken at high school.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker and hon members, on 29 January
2001 a very important speech was made. It went along the following lines:
There are two nations in this country. One nation can dream, the other
nation cannot. The one nation can write and is literate, the other nation
is not. The one nation performs very badly in school, the other nation does
not. There is hope for one and there is no hope for the other.

That speech was not made by President Mbeki. That speech was not made by
me. It was made by the President of the United States of America, George W
Bush. In the first speech that he made, he talked about the two nations. He
gave it away, unfortunately, by saying: ``Our performance in mathematics
comes below that of Cyprus and South Africa.'' Thus, it was self-
flagellation. It may have worked as part of the whole changed approach. We
must not carry it too far, though.

I think that it has been a very fruitful debate. I have a whole sheaf of
replies. I will engage the speakers. I would like to engage the speakers,
because in 10 minutes I cannot reply to all the points raised.

However, I must begin on the basis that there is an emerging consensus in
our country and that we should not play silly-billies with education. While
I listened to Mr Ntuli, I wanted to say: What a rational voice that I can
engage with. On the other hand there is Dr Geldenhuys. It is difficult to
believe that they speak for the same party. They must be speaking for a
bifocated party. [Laughter.] A bifocated party is a schizophrenic party. It
is not fair to those who are not schizophrenics, because one can treat
schizophrenia. However, this is an unremediable situation that we find
ourselves in.

I am going to say to Mr Ntuli that there is a place on this side of the
House for him, because that is the kind of basis we talk about. I want to
say to Dr Geldenhuys, for example, that we begin on that basis, but that
this is a plan that we will be carrying out in time. It is a firm
commitment. Obviously, there will be discussions. There will be discussions
with regional institutions. There will be further discussions and
negotiations, as we said, because this must be brought about within the
plan. For example, the hon member talked about time limits and autonomy.
Let me say that I am a strong believer in academic freedom by the way. It
is a much more obvious and palpable issue. One can feel academic freedom,
because violation of academic freedom can be very obvious in its
consequences.

Autonomy is an elusive notion. An Australian Minister of Education, a few
years ago, laid down that no institution whose enrolment was fewer that 8
000 students could exist. He just laid that down. The choice was either to
close down or merge and find the merging institutions. That was carried
out. We are not doing that. In fact, Mr McIntosh said that I am a
commissar. However, it was his conservative Australian Minister who
implemented the plan concerning having under 8 000 students not being a
viable institution.

We are not doing that. What we want to do is to look at the programmes and
how the programmes fit into each other, for example, to ensure that there
is a proper balance between arts and science. We are saying that, at
present, 49% of students are doing the humanities. That is too large a
proportion. We want, in fact, about 40% so that 30% will do science and the
other 30% will do subjects like accounting, which we need. In the same way,
we want to develop the teaching of African languages. Very few universities
and technikons in South Africa have professors in indigenous languages.

We will use this programmatic approach. We will use a bait of more funding
to establish chairs in the African universities. We also want to establish
chairs in more foreign languages too. Thus, in the same way, regarding the
language question, I do not think that we should inflame feelings about
this matter. I have said that I have set up a group of distinguished people
- Afrikaans-speaking and non-Afrikaans-speaking - to talk language issues
at the universities and technikons.

It is not only the Afrikaans language, but I have also looked at the Group
of 63 statement about international charters and conventions. Our
provisions of the Constitution go further in legal terms than any other
international charter convention. I am prepared to meet Dr Mulder - who had
to leave unfortunately - and go through the Group of 63 statement about
language and its relevance in South Africa.
Let the institutions show that when adopting a particular language policy
they do so in ways that do not undermine the goals of the system as
outlined in the White Paper and the plan we have put before members. I have
not ruled out an Afrikaans-medium university. Many of them have said that
they are not Afrikaans universities anymore. A distinguished Afrikaner
intellectual said that. I have not ruled that out. However, 5 out of 21
institutions means in fact that there is inherent discrimination. Thus, we
are not ruling out anything. We are responsibly guided by the ability of
the institutions to respond to national imperatives and take into account
the reports that I have received from the Council of Higher Education and
the Gerwel Report.

Regrettably, some members in the opposition benches continue to read the
plan out of context and in selective bytes. There is much more in the plan.
There is much more about the need to develop research in our institutions.
There is much more about giving remedial treatment to students who come in,
first-year students of all races, by the way. There is much more in the
plan about the need to have a central applications office - which Die
Burger misunderstood - so that students can have a real choice in the
matter. We want to South Africanise our institutions. Thus, we want white
students to go back to places like the Pretoria Technikon. We want white
students to go back and not flee to the private sector because our training
and education in the state institutions is much better than any private-
sector institution could provide. Thus, I asked members for their proposals
with regard to improving graduate outputs. That must be read in conjunction
with the development of very robust quality assurance systems.

Regarding Dr Geldenhuys, I know that he is a spokesperson on education and
there is a great deal to learn yet. We said in the report that there is a
higher education quality committee which will assess every degree and
qualification. We cannot have bogus degrees like some of correspondence
institutions' degrees which are bogus. Quality assurance will ensure that
there will be no superior and inferior degrees, according to which
employers categorise degrees at present.

I agree with Mr Ntuli that the capacity to plan has to be augmented at both
the institutional level and the level of my department. On the part of my
department, we will be drawing up an expertise exercise in the higher
education institutions through secondments. However, I must say that with
the limited staff of my department we have done an astonishing amount of
work. This plan has been praised by a highly reputable Norwegian
educationist, who said that they have not seen a plan of this dimension
anywhere yet, and he wishes us well in carrying it out.

With regard to the recruitment of academics from the rest of the continent,
we would remind the hon member that we are a part of that continent. Of
course, we must have government-to-government agreements on this. Therefore
we cannot lose our resources in the North as the African resources are
being lost to the North.

That is why we say, about student enrolments, that we want 10% of our
students to be from SADC countries as part of our regional development. It
is important. We are the first country to say that we must open our
institutions to our brothers and sisters who have done so much to assist in
the liberation of our continent. [Applause.] That is an altruistic thing.

But I must tell the hon members that altruism is very good for our
students, of all races, by the way, who lead insular, parochial lives, to
get students from other countries to enlarge their horizons, which is what
a universitas or university is supposed to do - enlarge our horizons. This
will not be at the expense of the South African students. It will be a part
of the augmentation of both numbers and capacity, in our institutions.

Prof Mbadi has been misinformed. The plan is clear that no current higher
education learning institution will be closed. On the contrary, new
opportunities are being opened up. The Government has decided that we must
develop two or three institutions for ICT, centres of excellence. This plan
will allow us to meet the needs - a kind of silicon valley of the mind.

We will develop two or three institutions as centres of excellence in
science and technology, and that is the Government's policy. So, we
rejected the Council on Higher Education report because, in fact, it said
that bedrock universities would be the old, historically black
universities, with no research and no post graduate work being done there.
We rejected that, because we cannot, in fact, solidify the fruits of
apartheid in our institutions.

There are many other points. Very important is the question of a school
system. I have answered that question. We say in the report that we must
build up a school system, even if we have to get Cuban mentors in science
and mathematics. This is a true internationalisation of learning. We are
firmly committed to the international approach to learning and higher
education. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                   ADJOURNMENT OF HOUSE FOR EASTER RECESS

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members that concludes the debate on this subject.

We have come to the end of two and a half months of very intensive work.
[Applause.] That may be premature. Wait till I finish. It has been hard
work. Members have applied themselves and we can, with justification, take
well-earned leave until after Easter.

I want to wish those who are marking religious occasions, particularly
those of the Jewish and Christian faiths, peace and serenity as they mark
those occasions, as well as fulfilment of their prayers.

After Easter, we go into a constituency period. I want to urge you, hon
members, to listen and reflect during that period: listen to your
constituents. I know you do this regularly, and you know what people are
saying in terms of their problems and needs. But I also want you to listen,
particularly to what they are saying about us, their representatives, and
what they think of this, their Parliament.

What do they say about the way in which we have conducted debates, the
extent to which members are seen to be conducting private discussions,
walking around, chatting and distributing documents; the groups of four to
five members conducting lengthy meetings, a habit which I regret extends to
some Ministers and party leaders, who turn their backs to the podium or the
Chair to conduct their work or have their social chats.

What do people think when we fail to have enough members to vote on a Bill
- and I want to remind you that this is not the first time that this has
happened. What respect can they have for us if we come in late, leave early
- not once but regularly; if we shout down speakers and each other with
noise, but rarely respond with wit or with facts.

That is what I have asked you to reflect on, and that is what I am asking
you to do: listen to what they are saying. They write to me and I am sure
they will tell you if you probe into this. And let us, fter that exercise
at the end of the constituency period, come back refreshed and renewed,
with the invigorating spirit of 1994, and not the rather jaded image that I
am afraid we are now projecting.

I now wish you well, as I said, for both rest, reflection and work;
refreshed to come back for a much harder session, when we have to deal with
a very intensive series of Votes. And with that, I wish you all au revoir.

The House adjourned at 18:30 until 8 May 2001 in terms of Rule 30(2).
