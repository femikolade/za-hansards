ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND DEBATE ON  A  NEW  PARTNERSHIP  FOR
AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Chairperson and  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the
NCOP, Madam Speaker and Deputy Speaker, hon Ministers and Deputy  Ministers,
premiers, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, a  recent  publication  of  the
World Bank asks the question: Can Africa claim the 21st century? It  is  our
firm view that together, as Africans, we must answer that  question  with  a
resounding yes. Africa's time has come.

When, at the end of the century, historians cast their eyes back over  this,
the 21st and African century, what will  they  see?  They  should  see  that
Africa has, at last, emerged from a long period of darkness  and  fear  into
one of light and a  dream  fulfilled.  They  should  see  that  through  our
persistent efforts, we have redefined ourselves into something other than  a
place of suffering, a place of wars, a  place  of  oppression,  a  place  of
hunger, of disease, of ignorance and of backwardness.

They should see the reality of a new  African  who,  having  refused  to  be
conditioned by circumstances imposed by a past of slavery,  of  colonialism,
of neo-colonialism, of racism and apartheid, has  succeeded  in  creating  a
new world of peace, of democracy, of development and of prosperity.

These are Africans who have chosen to  define  themselves  in  action.  They
have grown tired of being told who they are, where  they  come  from,  where
they ought to go and how they should proceed  with  their  journey.  Because
they have decided  to  become  the  masters  and  mistresses  of  their  own
destiny, to sing their own songs and dance to  their  own  tune,  they  have
succeeded in claiming the 21st century as their own. [Applause.]

The historians should see that, at last, an age-old dream of  the  unity  of
Africa has been realised among the millions on our continent, who are  bound
together by the oldest and most enduring land mass,  who  breathe  the  same
air, till the same soil, dream the same dreams and  awake  together  from  a
long night rocked by terrifying nightmares.  They  should  be  seen  walking
their continent and the common globe,  proud  Africans  who,  by  reclaiming
their place as equals with other human beings, have banished from the  earth
the scourge of racism and racial discrimination.

The  African  Union  and  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's   Development
constitute the ways and means we have chosen to take us  forward  decisively
towards  the  realisation  of  these  goals.  I  would  like  to  thank  the
Chairperson of the NCOP and the Speaker for providing all of  us  with  this
opportunity to discuss the initiatives critical to Africa's future, the  New
Partnership for Africa's Development and the African Union.

It is important that our discussion is  taking  place  in  this  Parliament,
which is the home of  our  elected  representatives  and  a  symbol  of  the
fulfilment of the struggles and sacrifices of the masses of  our  people  in
our common quest for the realisation  of  our  collective  demand  that  the
people shall govern. Undoubtedly the creation of a  new  parliament  in  our
own country, reflecting the will of the people, was  one  of  the  important
foundations for us to come together and  declare  in  unison  that  Africa's
time has come.

It is therefore obvious that a new partnership for the  development  of  our
continent would not have been possible if part of  Africa  was  still  under
the yoke of colonial  or  white  minority  rule.  Accordingly,  one  of  the
important preconditions  for  the  renewal  of  Africa  is  necessarily  the
complete liberation of the peoples of our continent.

Secondly, the Africans  themselves,  particularly  the  leadership,  had  to
arrive at  a  common  perspective  that  democracy  is  fundamental  to  the
regeneration of our countries and continent,  and  that  responding  to  the
correct demand for democracy is being true and faithful  to  the  people  on
whose behalf we aspire to govern.

Thirdly, a new partnership for development was possible  when  many  of  our
people on the  continent  came  to  the  common  determination  that  proper
adherence to good economic governance, aimed  at  the  emancipation  of  our
people from poverty, is as important as  ensuring  political  democracy.  As
with  our  approaches  to  political  processes,  the  time  since  Africa's
independence has offered valuable lessons about what we should  do  and  not
do  if  we  are  to  pull  ourselves  from  the  quagmire  of  poverty   and
underdevelopment, as we must.

Fourthly, we are able  to  take  practical  steps  in  the  renewal  of  the
continent, because we have resolved that we should find the ways to use  our
natural riches to improve the  living  conditions  of  all  of  our  people,
instead of these riches benefiting outsiders and a small elite.

Fifthly, the renaissance of the continent is possible  because  the  process
will involve the masses of our people, in their various formations and  from
different  stations  in  life,  as   conscious   agents   of   change.   The
businesspeople, women, the intelligentsia, the youth, workers,  politicians,
media workers, all of us have crucial and specific roles  that  we  can  and
must play to ensure that the renewal of our continent becomes a reality.

Lastly, the African Renaissance is possible because we have entered  into  a
new partnership with the rest of the world on  the  basis  of  what  we,  as
Africans, have determined is the correct route to our own  development.  The
New Partnership for Africa's  Development  states  -  and  this  was  agreed
unanimously at the last OAU summit in Lusaka in July - that, and I quote:


  The resources, including capital, technology and human skills,  that  are
  required to launch a global war on poverty and underdevelopment exist  in
  abundance, and are within our grasp. What is required to  mobilise  these
  resources and to use them properly, is bold  and  imaginative  leadership
  that is genuinely committed to a sustained effort of human upliftment and
  poverty eradication, as well as a new global partnership based on  shared
  responsibility and mutual interest.

Across the  continent,  Africans  declare  that  we  will  no  longer  allow
ourselves to be conditioned by  circumstance.  We  will  determine  our  own
destiny and call on the rest of the world to  complement  our  efforts.  The
OAU summit  said  that  there  are  already  signs  of  hope  and  progress.
Democratic regimes that are committed to the  protection  of  human  rights,
people-centred  development  and  market-oriented  economies  are   on   the
increase. African peoples have begun to demonstrate their refusal to  accept
poor economic and political leadership.  These  developments  are,  however,
uneven and inadequate and need to be expedited further.

The New Partnership for Africa's  Development  is  about  consolidating  and
accelerating these gains. It is a call, said the African leaders, for a  new
relationship of partnership between Africa and the international  community,
especially the highly industrialised countries, to overcome the  development
chasm that has widened over centuries of unequal relations.

In this regard, we  are  not  asking  for  favours,  but  for  fairness  and
justice, a better life for Africans and a secure future  for  all  humanity.
[Applause.]  This  programme  is  premised  on  African  ownership,  African
control of the projects  and  programmes,  with  African  leaders  accepting
openly and unequivocally that they will play their part  in  ending  poverty
and bringing about sustainable development.
We are agreed that we must strengthen democracy on the  continent;  entrench
a human rights culture; end existing conflicts and  prevent  new  conflicts:
We have to deal with corruption and be accountable to one  another  for  all
our actions. Clearly, these measures of ensuring democracy, good  governance
and the absence of wars and conflicts are important both for  the  wellbeing
of the people of Africa and for the  creation  of  positive  conditions  for
investment, economic growth and development.

Clearly, we cannot make the required  progress  and  realise  the  necessary
achievements in the process of the regeneration  of  our  continent  if  the
people of Angola, Burundi, the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo  and  Sierra
Leone are engaged in endless conflicts. To end these conflicts  and  find  a
lasting solution  to  their  causes  is  something  that  must  continue  to
preoccupy the collective mind of Africans, and participating in a  practical
programme of their resolution is a joint responsibility of  each  and  every
African patriot.

In this respect, I would like to extend our best wishes and  thanks  to  the
members of our SA National Defence Force who are being deployed  in  Burundi
to assist that sister  country  to  transform  itself  into  one  of  peace,
democracy and prosperity. [Applause.] Our  Deputy  President  has  left  for
Burundi this morning to represent our country as a new government  is  sworn
in tomorrow. Again, I would like to salute the facilitator  of  the  Burundi
peace process, Nelson Mandela ... [Applause] ... his team and the  political
leadership of Burundi for the important steps they are taking to expand  the
frontiers of liberty and peace.

To return to the new partnership, there are important measures that we  have
to undertake to mobilise the required resources so that  we  achieve  better
economic growth. To halve the incidence of poverty  by  the  year  2015,  we
need to achieve high and sustained rates  of  growth.  Among  other  things,
this will require increased domestic savings and better revenue  collection.
We also have to strengthen the public-private partnerships and  ensure  that
there are sufficient means and  capacity  to  implement  infrastructure  and
social programmes. The African Development Bank will play a central role  in
this regard.

Further, the programme  is  going  to  assist  countries  to  improve  their
individual financial markets, as well as address the challenge of better co-
ordination and harmonisation of cross-border  flows  through  the  Financial
Markets Integration Task Force. In addition, the  capital  flows  initiative
seeks to focus on debt  reduction  and  forgiveness,  reforming  development
assistance for Africa and working on mechanisms to increase private  capital
flows into the continent.

One of the most important challenges is to address the  negative  perception
among investors, who see Africa as a  high  risk  area.  While  we  need  to
address the genuine concerns  raised  by  potential  investors,  we  have  a
responsibility to  communicate  better  and  correctly  about  the  concrete
improvements we continue to make. In many  instances  the  investors  get  a
wrong message from those who do not wish Africa to  succeed.  The  voice  of
the majority of the people of Africa who  have  stabilised  their  political
and socioeconomic situations needs to be heard.

Africa is rich in agricultural, mineral and aquatic raw materials that  must
now be used to develop the continent's economies and peoples.  But  Africans
themselves must add value to these natural resources through  beneficiation,
so that the rest of the world receives them as manufactured  goods  and  not
merely as raw materials. [Applause.]

Through the Market Access Initiative Programme of  the  new  partnership  we
seek to advance  diversified  market  access  for  African  exports  to  the
developed countries of the North. The programme also seeks  to  nurture  the
vast, complex and rich African environment for the benefit of all  humanity.
In this regard there will be a coherent  environmental  programme  where  we
will have to make strategic choices  and  determine  particular  priorities.
The environment initiative will deal, among others, with  programmes  around
the  combating  of   desertification,   wetland   conservation   and   water
management, global warming, trans-frontier  conservation  and  environmental
governance.

The new partnership has  also  set  important  priorities  in  the  area  of
infrastructure  development  so  as  to  speed  up  the   process   of   the
modernisation and naturalisation of the continent  and  ensure  that  Africa
rises to the levels  of  the  developed  countries.  Clearly,  the  lack  of
infrastructure  constitutes  a  serious  handicap  to  social  and  economic
development.

Another priority area is information and communication technology.  We  have
to improve the ICT infrastructure and ensure that there is clear policy  and
strong regulatory mechanisms. Africa needs  adequate  access  to  affordable
telephones, computers, the Internet and broadcasting. To double  teledensity
by the year 2005, the continent needs in excess  of  US$8  billion  in  core
infrastructure alone.

Attracting investment needs, therefore, a comprehensive integrated  strategy
that will be supported by all the people of Africa. In addition, there  will
be a programme of human development so that our people  gain  the  necessary
knowledge and skills, and enjoy better and healthier lives.

 We have to work on a multipronged strategy, which we  are  discussing  with
the WHO, to overcome the  widespread  incidence  of  communicable  diseases,
such as malaria, tuberculosis and Aids. Among others,  we  have  to  improve
the quality of nutrition, so as  to  contribute  to  the  wellbeing  of  our
people, as well as to increased productivity.

We also need an improvement of our educational systems if we are to  compete
equally with the rest of the world.  In  this  regard  we  need  to  improve
facilities to ensure that primary and secondary  schools  are  available  in
all our villages  and  rural  areas  in  particular.  Further,  we  have  to
strengthen the university system,  including  the  creation  of  specialised
universities where needed, and establish institutes of technology.

The success of the New Partnership for Africa's  Development  will  only  be
guaranteed if all the people see themselves as  part  of  the  process,  not
only  of  deepening  democracy,  but  also  as  activists  in  projects  and
programmes that they engage in  partnership  with  Government.  Furthermore,
the development of the African continent will happen when we have  practical
programmes and workable partnerships with the developed  countries.  Already
there have been extensive engagements with various  developed  countries  as
well as with multilateral organisations. These include the G8, EU,  UN,  the
Nordic countries,  the  World  Bank,  IMF,  and  the  International  Finance
Corporation.

As members know, this Parliament, like others in our continent, adopted  the
Constitutive Act of the African Union, which will replace the  OAU  as  from
next year when the OAU will hold its last assembly, and  the  African  Union
its first, here in our country. [Applause.]  Again,  as  members  know,  the
African Union will be based on  the  following  objectives  and  principles,
among others: to achieve greater unity and solidarity  among  the  countries
and peoples of  our  continent;  to  accelerate  the  political  and  social
integration of the continent; to promote peace, security and  stability;  to
promote democratic principles and institutions,  popular  participation  and
good governance; to  promote  and  protect  human  and  people's  rights  in
accordance with the African Charter on Human and People's Rights  and  other
relevant human rights  instruments;  to  ensure  the  establishment  of  the
necessary conditions which enable the continent to play  its  rightful  role
in the global economy and in international negotiations;  and to ensure  the
promotion of co-operation in all fields  of  human  activity  to  raise  the
living standards of the peoples of our continent.

We see the transformation of the OAU into the African Union as an  important
process because we  need  a  continental  structure  better  suited  to  the
challenges of the 21st  century  and  better  geared  to  the  goal  of  the
realisation of the objective of Africa's renaissance.  Our  Parliament  made
important observations when considering the requests  for  the  approval  of
the Constitutive Act of the African Union. Among the important  observations
that were made was that the Constitutive  Act  appears  to  contain  various
clauses that could be open to different interpretations has various  clauses
that appear to be contradictory, and has clauses that may be interpreted  as
impinging  upon  the  sovereignty  of  member  states  in   the   executive,
legislative and judicial spheres, more than is usual  in  the  case  of  the
formation of such a union.

The report is valuable as it assists in focusing our collective mind on  the
areas that may pose problems as we try to form an  important  body  that  is
critical to our renewal as  a  continent.  In  appreciating  the  work  that
Parliament did, I would like to make a request to members  to  elaborate  on
the  areas  that  they  have  identified  and  propose  possible   remedies.
Furthermore, we need to spell out in what form we think the  various  organs
mentioned in the Constitutive Act should  state  the  protocols,  rules  and
regulations that should govern these structures.

Our Parliament should assist in giving  more  content  and  meaning  to  the
African Union so that the elected representatives of South Africa also  make
their humble contribution to the form, content and direction of  that  union
as it is being defined more precisely  prior  to  its  launch.  This  should
clearly be done in conjunction with other people in society who are  willing
and able to make  a  contribution,  be  they  NGOs,  universities,  research
bodies,   business   organisations,   trade   unions,   women   and    youth
organisations.

Similarly, we should encourage  our  counterparts  in  other  parts  of  the
continent to engage in this process of  shaping  and  participating  in  the
African Union and the New Partnership for Africa's  Development  in  such  a
manner that there is a clear response to the needs and demands  of  all  our
people, as well as the active involvement of those people.

In this way we will ensure that both the union and the programme  are  owned
by all our people in all of our countries. We will ensure that  the  African
Union and the New Partnership do not belong to the elite, but  are  products
of our people, and benefit, in a practical way, the poor of  our  continent,
wherever they may be. [Applause.]

We have embarked on these extraordinary measures, represented by the AU  and
the new partnership, because we have to eradicate  the  destructive  effects
of  slavery,  colonialism,  neo-colonialism,  apartheid,  wars,   conflicts,
disease and poverty that have characterised the African  continent  for  the
last few centuries. None but ourselves can do it.

The establishment of the African Union and the New Partnership for  Africa's
Development have come at a new time of new possibilities and new  hopes  for
the African people. These  initiatives  are  laying  the  groundwork  for  a
prosperous Africa that will triumph over poverty, disease,  underdevelopment
and despair. Their success is dependent on an effective partnership  between
governments and people, with the co-operation of the private sector,  and  a
true  partnership  with  the  developed  nations  that  also  have  Africa's
interests at heart.

Africa has decided to take the high road. The tasks we  have  set  ourselves
are ambitious, but the challenges we face no longer permit timidity. Nor  do
they allow that we should merely entertain hopes  and  do  nothing  to  turn
those hopes into reality. [Applause.]

The  African  Presidential  Implementation  Committee   has   already   been
established, and so have the other institutions. We need  to  translate  our
common vision into practical,  implementable  programmes.  Our  country  has
been  charged  with  the  task  of  hosting  the  Secretariat  of  the   New
Partnership, chairing its steering committee and convening  the  group  that
must elaborate the specific steps we need to take to ensure peace,  security
and stability throughout our continent. We have an obligation  to  discharge
these responsibilities successfully, driven by a sense of urgency.

The G8 have also constituted the special task force that will work  together
with our Steering Committee and the Secretariat. The European Commission  is
ready immediately to engage these organs of the New Partnership.  The  World
Bank, the IMF and the International Finance Corporation have already  joined
in the New Partnership.

The work has started to give meaning to  a  bold  vision  whose  realisation
will for us, at last, turn into reality the  concept  that  all  people  are
born equal and that all of us inhabit a global  village.  Ninety-five  years
ago, in 1906, Pixley ka Isaka Seme, the great African  patriot  and  freedom
fighter, looking far into the future, cried out:


  Oh, for that historian who, with the open pen of  truth,  will  bring  to
  Africa's claim the strength of written proof.


  He will tell of a race whose onward tide was often  swelled  with  tears,
  but in whose heart bondage has not quenched the fire of former years.
  He will write that in these later days when Earth's noble ones are named,
  she has a roll of honour too, of whom she is not ashamed.


  The giant is awakening!

Together, we must make this the African century and,  as  the  historian  of
whom Seme  spoke,  ``with  the  open  pen  of  truth''  inscribe  a  joyous,
triumphant Africa into the history book  of  the  world.  I  am  pleased  to
commend to hon members the New Partnership  for  Africa's  Development,  our
own programme made in Africa for the renewal of Africa. I urge  hon  members
to make it their own, to turn into reality the assertion that Africa's  time
has come. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, hon members  of  the  two  Houses,  in
1996, 14 of Africa's 53 states  were  afflicted  by  armed  conflict.  These
conflicts accounted for more than half of all war-related deaths  worldwide.
As a consequence of this insecurity, military  budgets  remained  very  high
across the continent. Until peace is  secured,  military  expenditures  will
continue to take a large slice  out  of  the  continent's  public  spending.
Securing peace,  therefore,  will  release  resources  for  redeployment  to
social needs.

What  we  need  are  well-defined  priorities  to  guide  resource  use,  in
particular to ensure that poverty reduction is achieved. Hard  choices  must
be made in this regard. The legacy of war has to be faced. Soldiers have  to
be demobilised, weapons have  to  be  decommissioned  and  refugees,  mainly
women and children, have to be resettled.

War means destruction, both of lives and infrastructure. But the  rebuilding
of that infrastructure could provide Africa with  a  golden  opportunity  to
overcome  geo-economic  colonial  patterns  of  interaction  among   African
states.  Road  and  rail  infrastructure  was  set  up  to  serve   colonial
interests. For instance, British colonies could interact  with  each  other,
but not with French or Portuguese colonies. These colonial patterns  can  be
replaced by  a  new  infrastructure,  which  can  lead  to  development  and
prosperity.
Demobilisation and the creation  of  a  smaller  and  professional  military
force are both expensive  and  trying  exercises.  The  establishment  of  a
peacetime defence force is also expensive. African leaders, in adopting  the
Constitutive Act of the African Union in July this year, stated:


  We are conscious ... of the fact that the scourge of conflicts in  Africa
  constitutes a major impediment to the socioeconomic  development  of  the
  continent and of the need to promote peace, security and stability  as  a
  prerequisite for the implementation of our  development  and  integration
  agenda.

It states, as one of its objectives, the promotion of  peace,  security  and
stability on  the  continent.  Amongst  its  principles  are,  firstly,  the
establishment  of  a  common  defence  policy  for  the  African  continent;
secondly, peaceful resolution  of  conflicts  among  member  states  of  the
Union; and, thirdly, the prohibition of the use of force or  threat  to  use
force among member states of the Union.
The  New  African  Initiative  -  now  referred  to  as  Nepad,  -  the  New
Partnership for Africa's Development, states:


  To  achieve  these  objectives,   African   leaders   will   take   joint
  responsibility  to  strengthen  mechanisms   for   conflict   prevention,
  management and resolution at the regional and continental levels, and  to
  ensure that these mechanisms are used to restore and maintain peace;

Nepad  states  that  targeted  capacity-building  should  be  given  a  high
priority. It further states that  efforts  to  build  Africa's  capacity  to
manage all aspects of conflict focus on the means  necessary  to  strengthen
existing continental and regional institutions  and  should  concentrate  on
four key areas: firstly, prevention, management and resolution of  conflict;
secondly,  peacemaking,  peacekeeping  and   peace   enforcement;   thirdly,
postconflict  reconciliation,   rehabilitation   and   reconstruction;   and
fourthly, combating the illicit proliferation of small arms,  light  weapons
and antipersonnel land mines and bomblets.
In relation to SADC, the emphasis has been placed squarely on the  need  for
peace, stability and security in our region and within the  borders  of  our
respective states.  Consequently,  the  Inter  State  Defence  and  Security
Committee, the ISDSC, has agreed, guided of course by  the  SADC  organ,  to
work towards a mutual defence pact which aims to  prevent  conflict  in  the
region and reflects a collective approach to  security  among  countries  of
our region.

The ISDSC of SADC is working towards a regional partnership.  We  have  just
recently held the first session of the South Africa-Namibia joint  permanent
commission on defence and security. We will be holding  the  next  one  with
Botswana in the near future. This is within the framework  of  regional  co-
operation.

We have advanced within those contacts with the countries of our  region  to
the sharing of intelligence, which is a  major  milestone  for  purposes  of
managing crime within the region. Our defence training institutions are  now
accommodating and training officers at all levels, from both the region  and
the continent.  This  will  ensure  a  common  security  understanding  and,
therefore, lays the basis for  the  emergence  of  a  regional  and  finally
continental joint force. We  have  agreed  with  our  Angolan  and  Malawian
counterparts earlier this year to make available South African military  and
medical services for their injured soldiers.

Another priority agreed on by the ISDSC is the building of the  capacity  of
African institutions for an early warning system. Further to the above,  how
does Defence envisage the operationalising of  Nepad?  Peace  and  stability
are strategic issues and throw up the main challenges. The key is to  ensure
that defence efforts are put behind the objectives of Nepad. We  must  build
the capacity of regional organisations to manage security organisations  and
processes. We must build the capacity of  national  governments  to  improve
security processes. This entails a common understanding on the continent  of
the need for strong civil-military relations as fundamental to  the  working
of a democratic state.

Demobilisation, the release of military people  into  civilian  life,  is  a
common problem and yet it can be converted into  an  advantage.  How  do  we
utilise their skills? Can we turn the situation around and empower  soldiers
to become agents of transformation,  so  that  when  they  demobilise,  they
enter  civil  society  with   skills   and   are   trained   as   engineers,
communications and IT specialists, health workers, etc?

History records, if I may take hon members  into  my  confidence,  that  the
American experience at the end of the Second World  War  was  that,  because
they had trained the armed forces in health care,  when  these  people  were
released, the education that they took back into American  life  transformed
dental hygiene in that nation. There is  no  reason  why  we  cannot  employ
similar examples  as  well.  Our  medical  services  can  and  are  fighting
diseases. We can work on joint programmes  with  other  militaries  in  this
field, not only for national but also for regional interest as well.

Small arms proliferation has been identified as  a  major  problem.  Defence
supports the police in terms of operational and  intelligence  capabilities.
We  can  learn  from  the  Joint  Policing  Commission  with  Mozambique  on
successfully tracking arms caches and destroying them. South Africa has  the
capacity to destroy large amounts of small weapons.

What is the way forward? We must complete, as legislation  now  allows,  the
transformation process we have been engaged in up  until  now.  But  we  now
need to develop new capabilities, so that the New Partnership  for  Africa's
Development can benefit from the support we can lend it. With this, we  will
release the energies of the African continent as a whole, and buy into  that
process. South Africans must take ownership in  the  way  they  did  in  the
formulation of the White Paper on Defence and the Defence Review.

We are embarking on a consultative process and intend to engage  with  other
African countries in conferences and symposia to take this process  forward.
These will be organised together  with  Foreign  Affairs  and  will  involve
representatives from the country's armed forces and from civil society.

It is in this spirit that I would like to share with this  House  today  the
fact that we are about to complete deployment in Burundi. We have  consulted
with all the religious bodies in our country. We have appealed to them  that
the services this coming weekend  should  be  devoted  to  praying  for  the
success of the peace efforts in which we are  involved.  [Applause.]  It  is
important, for the success of the Burundi  process,  precisely  because  our
armed forces are going in that process without a ceasefire being  in  place.
We are convinced that its success is assured with the co-operation that  the
parties in that country are displaying. We wish, therefore, for  members  to
join congregations  where  possible,  in  order  to  support  this  national
effort. [Applause.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Chairperson, Madam Speaker, Mr  President  and
colleagues, this is a very important and proud  day  for  the  President.  I
think South Africans can  put  aside  their  differences  on  this  day  and
acknowledge, with a strong sense of common purpose  ...  [Interjections.]  I
would save my breath, because those hon members are going to swallow  a  lot
quite soon. They should just perhaps save it for then. [Laughter.]

The President has played a leading role in drafting and  promoting  the  New
Partnership for Africa's Development. Although the plan has  undergone  many
name changes, more than a certain political party currently in the news  ...
[Laughter] ... I think we all know  and  appreciate  that  it  reflects  the
spirit and intention of the President's original MAP.  In  fact,  since  the
President outlined the architecture of MAP in Davos in  Switzerland  at  the
beginning of this year, I have been a firm supporter of it. I  also  believe
the plan could work, because it seems to me  that,  putting  what  is  being
said into plain language, if one allows one's circumstances  to  define  and
change one, then one is doomed.  However,  if  one  chooses  to  define  and
change one's  circumstances,  then  one  will  live,  succeed  and  prosper.
[Applause.]
Therefore, I think it is important, as the President  said  today,  that  we
replace the old caricature and stereotype of Africa - with the  outstretched
hand and the begging bowl - with the new image  of  Africa's  place  in  the
world. This is  the  image  of  the  responsible  and  businesslike  African
leader, head held high and making a fair deal with developed nations.

In  exchange  for  open  trade,  increased  investments   and   humanitarian
assistance, it is said in the plan that African leaders undertake to  engage
in, and I quote:


  ... a series of commitments  towards  meeting  basic  standards  of  good
  governance and democratic behaviour ...


To that, we can only say: amen.

The plan has a potential for success, I believe, because it  is  investment-
oriented. It is realistic. It does not  baulk  at  what  a  famous  American
writer has  called  ``the  golden  straitjacket''.  That  is  a  garment  of
policies, to which Mr Manuel made mention  yesterday,  which  include  clean
and open governance, respect for human  rights,  the  rule  of  law,  market
deregulation and trade liberalisation. Those, commonly  together,  are  what
developing countries must put on if we want to be part  of  the  new  global
economy.

We know, whether it is right or wrong, fair  or  unfair,  as  the  President
said, that foreign investors whom we seek,  themselves  seek  well-governed,
open and stable places in which to do business. When he was in  Johannesburg
a few months ago, US Secretary of State, Colin Powell,  said  the  following
at Wits University:


  Money, simply stated, is a coward. Capital will run from those  countries
  which are closed, which are corrupt, which  do  not  have  open  systems,
  which do not believe in the rule of  law,  or  which  are  caught  up  in
  conflict. Money loves security, money loves  transparency,  legality  and
  stability. Create those conditions in any country, and  money  will  flow
  in.
I am not sure whether the world is quite as simple as that, but that is  the
necessary, if not sufficient, conditions to go in.

Fulfilling Africa's promise, turning it from a plan into reality,  which  is
what the President's address dealt with this afternoon, it seems to  me,  is
going to take three kinds of partnerships: firstly, between Africa  and  the
developed world; secondly, among all African leaders,  not  just  among  the
Wadays, the Obasanjos and Mbekis,  but  also  among  the  Gaddafis  and  the
Mugabes; and crucially, between African leaders and their people.

This afternoon, the President said that there is no intention of this to  be
an elite's top-down plan. I think that that is correct. But it  is  actually
the third partnership that, really to me, is absolutely  crucial,  and  that
is,  between  governments  and  the  people  themselves.  The   rebirth   of
democracy, good governance, free trade and growth of our continent  are  too
important to be left to an elite of leaders. Those ideals will be  stillborn
unless the people are allowed to  change  from  the  bottom  up,  with  both
enterprise and the free exchange of our ideas.

The  President  asked  for  Parliament  to  make  comments,  criticisms  and
reservations about the document. Perhaps, I could note one,  in  particular,
about the document that we are discussing today. It is, with great  respect,
that it puts too much trust in leaders and not enough trust  in  people.  In
many parts of our continent the state is a weak and patchy  entity,  yet  it
is expected, according to the document, to  monitor  its  own  adherence  to
good governance and human rights. With all due  respect,  that  is  not  the
best place for the monitoring to take place.  Oversight  of  governments  is
the job of civil society, the media, NGOs, and the opposition.

I believe that during question time last week the President  said  that  the
system of peer review  would  be  used  to  monitor  compliance  of  African
governments to the plan, as provided for in  the  Constitutive  Act  of  the
African Union. Today, he indicated that the Constitutive Act of the  African
Union has been passed by this Parliament. Indeed it has, and  he  said  that
he would entertain a debate and a dialogue on what it actually means.

I  wish  to  make  an  observation  in  that  regard.  I  believe  that  the
Constitutive Act of the African Union, which all parties supported  in  this
Chamber,  is  long   on   principles,   most   of   which   are,   actually,
unobjectionable. But the problem is: it seems to me  that  it  is  short  on
mechanisms for  implementing  them.  For  example,  article  4  of  the  Act
enshrines respect for democratic principles, human rights, the rule  of  law
and good governance.

Article 23 provides, and I quote for ``sanctions for any member  state  that
fails to comply with the decisions and policies  of  the  Union''.  That  is
fine, correct and necessary. But, and this seems to me a gap  or  a  lacuna,
it does not say how compliance should be monitored, measured or enforced.  I
think that if one does not address that, then  one  has  something  that  is
very good on intention but not necessarily on delivery.

In terms of making something that could be a proposal, may  I  suggest  that
we have regard for an independent, nongovernmental  agency  which  would  be
more  effective  at  monitoring  African  governments,  or  any  governments
anywhere in the world, than simply a system  of  peer  review  by  heads  of
state.

Member states have, in the past, on this  continent  and  elsewhere,  proved
too willing to overlook the atrocities of their neighbours, and close  ranks
around people who  are  not  democrats.  The  subcommittee  responsible  for
ensuring compliance with principles of good governance, human rights,  peace
and stability - which, as the President said today, is  to  be  chaired  and
convened by South Africa - should, with respect, propose the creation of  an
independent agency to monitor the  compliance  of  governments.  The  agency
should report and make recommendations on a regular basis to the  Parliament
of the African Union.

Secondly, the subcommittee must, with respect, elaborate on  the  conditions
and procedures necessary  for  the  African  Union  to  implement  sanctions
against leaders who violate these principles. I believe a  useful  model  is
the European  Union's  procedure  for  activating  sanctions  against  other
countries, such as Zimbabwe, using article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.

I believe we must also look at the context of this  agreement  in  the  very
changed world in which we meet today. It is very instructive and  noteworthy
that Africa has good friends in the European Union and in the United  States
of America. Even after the United States  of  America  and  the  world  were
rocked by the terrorism of 11 September, their political commitment to  this
continent has remained firm.

The plan  presented  by  President  Mbeki  was  well  received  in  Brussels
recently. Prime Minister Tony Blair has pledged to  keep  Africa  firmly  on
his foreign policy agenda. On Monday, which was  as  recently  as  two  days
ago, President George W Bush, notwithstanding his other travails and  crises
that  he  presides  over,  launched  a  $200  million   private   investment
corporation to help finance and ensure US investment in sub-Saharan  Africa.
It is a feather in South Africa's cap that President Bush wants  to  base  a
regional office of this facility in Johannesburg.

But, frankly, we need all the political support that  we  can  get,  because
economic investment is draining away not just from this  continent  or  this
country, but across the world to safer capital  markets.  That  is  not  the
fault of any one person or individual, or any amount  of  background  noise,
criticism or choirs of approval. It is simply a reality of the world  as  it
has changed since 11 September.

It is also inevitable that a portion of development aid to  Africa  will  be
diverted to funding the war against terrorism. In this changed  world  after
11 September, I believe that we must choose our friends very carefully.  The
African Union must not be tainted by taking money from states which have  an
international terrorist record. I do not think we should trust  them.  I  do
not think that the world does either.

I think it would be better to scale down the size and scope of the  proposed
institutions  outlined  in  the  Constitutive  Act  than   to   risk   their
credibility. The implementation committee  of  the  new  partnership  should
consider this issue. But, also, as  Prof  Ronald  Dworkin  once  said,  hard
cases make bad law. To keep  our  friends  in  the  United  States  and  the
European Union, Africa and South Africa  should  heed  their  concerns.  The
hard case on our immediate doorstep remains, unfortunately, Zimbabwe.

Deputy President Zuma, who is not  with  us  for  reasons  explained  today,
complained only last week when he was in Botswana that  the  world  ``cannot
judge all of us on the basis of what some of our brothers  and  sisters  are
doing''. This is absolutely true. It is very unfair for  investors  to  take
one look, for example at President Mugabe and his government, and write  off
all of Southern Africa. But they would be reassured if they  saw  Zimbabwe's
neighbours making a much greater effort to  distance  themselves  from  that
style of government.
Both the United States Congress  and  the  European  Union  Parliament  have
taken  steps  to  implement  diplomatic  and  other  sanctions  against  the
Zimbabwean  government  if  it  continues  to  flout  principles   of   good
governance, human rights and the rule of law. South Africa must look at  the
same options, the same bundle. The Commonwealth's attempt to hold  President
Mugabe to the Abuja Agreement, apparently, has failed.

I believe that  we  need  a  more  proactive  approach  to  this  particular
initiative and to put pressure on the government there to restore  the  rule
of law and to allow  free  and  fair  presidential  elections  monitored  by
independent observers. Perhaps we  should  draft  our  own  version  of  the
US/Zimbabwe  democracy  and  economic  recovery  Act.  I  believe   in   all
circumstances the thing we  cannot  show  is  apathy  towards  solving  this
immediate neighbourhood crisis.

In sharp contrast, let me just draw a distinction between what is  happening
in the north and what is happening in the centre. What has been thrown  into
sharp relief is our timely  and  urgent  intervention  in  Burundi.  The  DA
supports our peacekeeping efforts there, under the experienced mediation  of
former president Mandela.

An HON MEMBER: There is no DA any longer!

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Well, those  members  might  be  inheriting  a
portion of the DA, so they have to be very quiet over there!

The Minister of Defence, Mr  Lekota,  indicated  yesterday  the  urgency  of
sending troops to safeguard the transitional government of Burundi. He  said
he would like - and he repeated it today - all parties to jointly  send  off
the next battalion on Saturday from Pretoria. He is right to ask  this,  and
I believe the situation is urgent. I do hope and trust that Parliament  will
be fully briefed and consulted about this deployment from now on.

In conclusion, the economist, Prof  Ayiti  wrote  that  African  elites  and
nationals failed after independence to build  upon  pre-colonial  traditions
of participatory democracy and free village markets. To  succeed  this  time
around, the new generation of leaders need to do more,  and  we  need  those
free markets and participation. This we will support, and this way  we  will
keep our promise. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Chairperson, hon President and hon members, I intend  to  focus
my intervention today on the role that parliaments  can  and  must  play  in
ensuring the success of the New  Partnership  for  Africa's  Development.  I
want to thank the President for not making it necessary for me  to  advocate
that role of parliaments, but really to spell it out.

Regrettably, there is scant reference to the  parliamentary  involvement  in
the basic document of the partnership, where the assumption is  that  action
is required by  heads  of  state  and  members  of  the  executive.  It  is,
therefore,  particularly  welcome  that  the  President   has   urged   this
Parliament and other parliaments to become involved in the  partnership  and
the establishment of the African Union.
With respect, action among heads of state alone and  by  the  executives  is
not going to solve Africa's problems, nor will it  build  African  unity  or
democracy, which are necessary prerequisites for sustainable development  on
the continent. A prime requirement for success is the  mobilisation  of  the
people of Africa, a will and desire to engage them in  the  process,  and  a
leadership that will both listen as well as give guidance.  I  am  delighted
to note that on both sides of this House there seems today to  be  agreement
on this.

We in this Parliament are still working hard to ensure that  there  is  good
governance in South Africa. We have achieved a great deal in six and a  half
years of democracy, but must acknowledge that  more  is  required.  The  New
Partnership for Africa's Development provides us  with  the  opportunity  to
take our process forward, even as we assist in establishing good  governance
on the continent.

The tasks listed under  the  Democracy  and  Governance  Initiative  of  the
partnership  are  pre-eminently  the  responsibility  of  parliaments.  This
Initiative  is  charged  with  strengthening  political  and  administrative
frameworks, promoting democracy,  transparency,  accountability,  integrity,
respect for human rights and the rule of law.  The  priority  areas  include
strengthening parliamentary  oversight,  participatory  decision-making  and
combating corruption.

 Each country, I understand, is responsible,  in  the  first  instance,  for
ensuring its own compliance. We therefore need  to  systematically  look  at
each of these aspects and discuss where we South Africans  are  and  how  we
can improve our own performance.

At the same time, parliamentarians can also help in  the  implementation  of
Napad by fostering  dialogue  and  identifying  common  programmes  that  go
beyond narrow party-political or narrowly  national  interests;  making  our
parliaments an effective mechanism of oversight  and  accountability,  which
includes effective monitoring of the implementation of the  new  partnership
and compliance by all countries  to  its  needs;  enacting  legislation  and
establishing mechanisms that will foster good governance, the  rule  of  law
and transparency in public life;  and  improving  the  legal  framework  and
environment within which civil society, labour, business  and  the  academic
research  community  can   contribute   to   the   implementation   of   the
partnerships, projects and programmes.

We as parliamentarians must also take these  programmes  and  objectives  to
the grass-roots level, even as we work to make  Parliament  more  accessible
to the public and encourage  participation  in  and  ownership  of  the  new
partnership. We should also assist  the  committee  which  is  investigating
best practices, setting parameters and  guidelines,  including  establishing
codes of conduct  for  political  leaders  with  mechanisms  for  compliance
throughout the continent. We have some experience of this and  we  could  do
better as we develop them further.

South Africa has been assigned responsibility, as we have been  informed  to
head the Peace and Security Initiative. South African  experience  needs  to
be assessed for its possible relevance elsewhere in conflict prevention,  as
well as resolution. Parliaments across the continent will need  to  exercise
oversight over African  institutions  established  to  prevent,  manage  and
resolve  conflicts,  as  well  as  those  forces  engaged  in   peacemaking,
peacekeeping  and  enforcement.  All  African  parliaments  will   need   to
establish mechanisms to do so and, in particular, monitor  and  oversee  all
agencies engaged in security, including intelligence, as well as  monitoring
the deployment of defence forces.

I am appreciative that the President's Office  has  continued  the  practice
since 1994 of alerting the Speaker at an early stage of the  possibility  of
deployment, as well as complying  with  the  constitutional  requirement  of
informing Parliament of the  details  of  deployments.  Even  as  we  deploy
military forces in Burundi  and  respond  to  requests  for  involvement  in
peacekeeping elsewhere, we should  be  aware  that  an  absence  of  war  or
conflict  at  any  time,  may  be  a  temporary  phenomenon  and  does   not
necessarily imply that the population can feel secure.
Parliament can and should be giving serious consideration  to  developing  a
national understanding of all that is encompassed in the  concept  of  human
security, and promoting policies that will ensure the conditions  that  will
provide security for the people of this country and of  the  continent.  The
UN  Secretary-General,  Kofi  Annan,  has  indicated  that  ensuring   human
security is one of the major challenges of the 21st century.

As was indicated, Parliament must play a major role as the Constitutive  Act
of the African Union is implemented. We understand that protocols will  need
to be agreed for implementation of various  aspects,  as  well  as  for  the
establishment of the various organs of the Union.

When we ratified the Constitutive Act, Parliament drew attention to some  of
the potential problems that might arise and we urged the executive  to  take
these into account in the process of implementation. We will  certainly  now
investigate these further. However, I believe that more is required  of  us.
It is necessary for Parliament to play a part in the negotiations that  will
result in the implementation of various parts of the Act.

It would not be sufficient to  be  informed  after  an  agreement  has  been
reached. The declaration submitted to the United Nations Millennium  General
Assembly by over 160 presiding officers of national  parliaments  emphasised
the necessity of such a procedure in reaching all multilateral agreements.

 This Parliament needs to undertake  a  more  detailed  examination  of  the
Constitutive Act of the Union than we will be able to undertake at the  time
of  ratification.  We  should  also  begin  to  take  up  the  challenge  or
invitation posed  by  the  President  and  engage  the  executive  and  make
recommendations on implementation.

Parliament's committees played a significant role  during  the  negotiations
of the trade agreement with the European Union. We  need  to  do  even  more
now. We  urge  Government  to  indicate  the  aspect  of  the  treaty  under
consideration at any time so that Parliament can scrutinise it, involve  the
public and engage in debates as well as make recommendations.  At  the  same
time, I would request that  members  of  Parliament  become  part  of  South
African delegations involved in the various processes that  will  result  in
decisions by the heads of state. In that way, South Africa will be  able  to
demonstrate an aspect of participatory democracy in practice.

The relative absence of the role of parliaments in the partnership  document
reflects the relatively low status accorded to parliaments in many parts  of
our continent - simply as institutions to process  the  making  of  laws  as
determined by the executive. In South Africa, the  Constitution  established
the responsibilities of this Parliament in governance. Nonetheless,  we  can
strengthen ourselves and all parliaments in the continent  by  developing  a
collective vision of the role and function of parliaments in  promoting  and
protecting democracy. If we do this with public participation, we  will  not
only diminish alienation, improve  public  perceptions  of  parliamentarians
and our institution, but we will also strengthen  and  protect  parliaments,
politically, and democracy itself.

The South African Parliament is a member of a number  of  interparliamentary
organisations  viz  the  Commonwealth  Parliamentary   Association;   Inter-
Parliamentary  Union;  Africa  Caribbean  Pacific  -  European  Union  Joint
Assembly; the SADC Parliamentary Forum; and the soon  to  be  convened,  Pan
African Parliament. All these provide us with a  platform  to  both  develop
and promote a vision of Parliament and to learn from each other. We need  to
ensure that in each country, including our own, due regard is given  to  the
status of Parliament  and  not  allow  it  to  be  ignored  or  subsumed  in
government.

Drawing a distinction between the executive from the  executive  is  neither
pedantic nor simply semantic. Parliament is one of three arms of  governance
and the premier institution of democracy. This needs to  be  recognised  and
respected and, I am glad to say that in South Africa  it  is.  But  it  also
requires that members of Parliament, through their performance, live  up  to
their responsibilities.

The South African Parliament will need to develop its own  institutions  and
practices and build greater capacity and  expertise.  I  am  sure  that  the
necessary resources to enable us to do this are forthcoming and I very  much
regret Mr Manuel's absence, at this point, in the House.  But,  nonetheless,
we are looking forward to those resources being made available.

In conclusion, the partnership  we  speak  of  is  not  simply  one  between
governments or business. We need to build partnerships among parliaments  in
Africa as well as between them and parliaments in the  developed  countries.
In that way, we will develop genuine  understanding  among  our  peoples  so
that the partnerships we develop will be  based  on  solid  foundations  and
will endure. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Speaker, the  hon  the  President,
hon members, I have a sense of excitement on this occasion  because  I  feel
that we are embarking upon another great venture. With  our  own  liberation
and democracy, I think we all understood that Africa's time  of  renaissance
had come and that we, South Africa, would have to play an important role  in
that process. But I do not think that we  knew  precisely  what  that  would
mean. Today, I believe we know what that will mean.

In the development of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, we  have
begun to spell out, in considerable detail, the actual steps that will  have
to be taken as we embark on this new venture. It seems to me  that,  in  the
new partnership, there are really three critical or seminal issues at  work.
The first is, as the President said, that Africans own it. Secondly, as  the
President said, but I think it is worth spelling out,  this  is  a  coherent
political and economic plan within the framework of  a  new  African  Union,
but it takes account of the essential  socioeconomic  requirements  for  any
development and for any renaissance.

I believe also of critical importance is that  the  detailed  work  that  we
have done allows for the phased  development  of  sectors,  the  phasing  of
policy and the introduction of enabling infrastructure. In the area  that  I
would like to address in these few minutes which deals with trade,  regional
economic integration, the diversification of production, market  access  and
exports, this phasing aspect is really critically important.

What we have to do is to work  with  everyone  in  Africa  to  identify,  in
considerable detail, the areas that we can act on -  what  things  could  be
done at the beginning and what things will have to be  done  later.  I  must
say, for all of us involved, it has been an extremely  exciting  process  as
we have linked with the economists, experts  and  Ministers  across  Africa,
and found a tremendous energy, intellectual enthusiasm and knowledge on  our
continent.

I think, for me, this approach to  the  problem  of  rigorous  analysis  and
detail, but a desire to move forward, is captured  very  much  by  Gramsci's
famous saying of: Pessimism of the intellect but optimism of the will.

If we are going  to  attain  the  higher  standards  that  will  underpin  a
renaissance and development in Africa, then, quite clearly, what we have  to
generate is a  process  of  accumulation  and  value  addition  in  all  the
economies of Africa. The economies that are confined to  the  various  forms
of subsistence agriculture or where agriculture  is  confined  only  to  the
primary stages of production cannot achieve these rates  of  investment,  or
more important still, the value addition or the beneficiation that  the  hon
the President spoke of.

However, what we also have to accept and realise is that the  conditions  of
modern production in competitive world markets are vastly different  to  the
times when we attempted to plan industrialisation in Africa.  We  also  have
to accept that consumers, no  matter  where  they  are  or  how  poor  their
countries are, will no longer accept  products  that  are  not  of  quality,
products that they do not see as comparable with what is manifestly  visible
on TV and elsewhere every day.

If we are going to bring about diverse  production,  industrialisation,  and
beneficiation, the first step is to put in place the  modern  infrastructure
that is an essential component of these processes. To illustrate, it is  not
possible, as it may  have  been  before,  to  export  textiles  or  clothing
anywhere in  the  world  if  one  does  not  have  a  reliable  supplier  of
electricity that works day in, hour in and minute  in  and  does  not  break
down. Many economies in Africa just do not have that basic energy  capacity.
So it has to be one of our first priorities.

The approach that we are taking in the new partnership is  to  look  at  the
questions of market access and regional integration within Africa  and  then
look at the questions of market access for Africa to the rest of the  world.
In regard to the first step, quite clearly, as the  President  and  Minister
Lekota said, our colonial and imperial past has meant that the economies  of
Africa were not designed  to  trade  with  themselves  during  the  colonial
period.  The  previous  trade  routes  were  broken  down,  economies   were
restructured and all infrastructure pointed to the industrial North, not  to
each other. So, the very first step that we have to  take  is  to  begin  to
cross our boundaries with economic infrastructure. In the absence  of  that,
all is a pipe dream.

We have to upgrade this infrastructure and move the energy  systems  forward
- and I am sure the Minister of Minerals and Energy will speak  about  this.
We also have to  put  in  place  some  very  elementary  things  which  most
economies of the world have, but, in Africa, we still  do  not  have.  These
are just the basic recognition of standards, and the  basic  recognition  of
sanitary provisions in our  trade  agreements.  We  have  to  build  private
sectors that can compete in these markets.

Clearly, South Africa can play a very critical role. Our own  restructuring,
since 1994, has virtually been a revolution in our economy. We  are  capable
of world competitive trade, not just at  the  average  but  at  the  leading
edge. So the structures of  trade  facilitation  and  support  that  we  can
provide in Africa are considerable indeed.

In regional economic integration, we are beginning to  make  great  strides.
Recently, in Parliament, we  tabled  the  new  agreement  for  the  Southern
African Customs Union. I would urge members to have a close look at this.  I
think it is, in many respects, a breakthrough.

This is the oldest customs union in the world today. For the first time,  we
will be establishing a common system of decision-making, a common system  of
rule setting and tariff setting and this may bode well  for  the  structures
that we have to develop in future.

The SADC Free Trade Agreement  is  progressing  well,  with  more  and  more
member states coming into it. In  Ecowas  in  West  Africa  they  are  fast-
tracking the  integration,  and  Comesa  is  beginning  to  refine  its  own
processes.

We are also developing new and exciting ways of crossing  our  borders.  The
great Limpopo trans-frontier park is an exciting development, not  only  for
environment and conservation, but for  economic  development,  and  I  think
these kinds of exercises transform the  whole  concept  of  environment  and
development and will assist us in the coming conference on the World  Summit
for Sustainable Development.

So, in Africa, we are beginning to work together.  Between  Africa  and  our
trading partners there are a number of matters  that  we  need  to  address.
First and foremost, we must, I think, as Africa,  be  at  the  forefront  of
demanding that there be a new round  of  negotiations  in  the  World  Trade
Organisation, but that that round has to fundamentally -  not  peripherally,
not incidentally, but fundamentally - address the developmental issues.

This is not an abstract concept. These requirements have been spelt  out  in
massive detail by the developing countries,  and  I  think  they  have  been
argued for very cogently and very correctly.  Specific  agreements  such  as
the Cotonou agreement for the ACP and Agoa,  are  important  new  agreements
that, if correctly used and if we can carry out the processes I mentioned  a
moment ago, we can make great use of.

These trade agreements should not be underestimated. Recently, the  European
Union pointed out just how much South Africa's trade  had  grown,  and  what
that really means is  that  customs  union  trade  has  grown  with  Europe.
Members might be interested to know that in the Agoa programme, the  leading
exporter of clothing and apparel in Africa was  not  South  Africa:  it  was
Lesotho, our neighbour. In the first  seven  months  of  this  year  Lesotho
exported $139 million's worth of clothing and apparel  and,  over  the  last
year, they have created nearly 10 000 jobs out of trade. That is an  amazing
achievement. So, trade can benefit economies rapidly and quickly.

What we are working on now is the detailed documentation and proposals  that
are going forward. One of the proposals that we  intend  putting  is  for  a
special preference agreement for trade in  Africa  itself.  We,  as  Africa,
should  have  a  general  system  of  preferences  for  the  trade   between
ourselves.

I would urge that we have to work together closely  and,  as  Parliament,  I
would urge that we support, from all parties, the opening of our economy  to
our African trading partners. This is fundamental. [Applause.] I would  urge
colleagues to ensure that the business community should  involve  themselves
actively in this, and I know that they are already  doing  so.  We  need  to
work together.

The trade union movements and, in particular, the professional  associations
in our civil society  can  all  play  a  role  in  the  development  of  our
continent and our countries. When we achieve  this,  we  achieve,  in  South
Africa, a lasting and prosperous peace. [Applause.]

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Madam Speaker, last month I  had  the  privilege  of
meeting with former President Masire ... [Applause.]
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order!

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Last month I  had  the  privilege  of  meeting  with
former President Masire in Botswana. He  is  now  heading  the  Congo  peace
talks. As President of his country, he  presided  over  the  fastest-growing
economy in Africa.  He  illustrated  that  if  the  economic  and  political
fundamentals are in place, success will follow.

Earlier  this  year  I  visited  Mozambique  to  observe  some   development
projects. The last time I visited that country was in the 1980s. Maputo,  at
that stage, fitted the picture of a run-down  African  city  with  not  much
hope.

After more than a decade, I found it  a  different  Maputo.  Yes,  there  is
still substantial poverty, but there is suddenly a ray of hope in  the  sky.
New shops are opening, young entrepreneurs are trading, but  what  impressed
me most of all was the attitude of  young  Mozambicans.  A  group  of  young
Mozambicans who graduated in South Africa and  other  countries,  showed  me
around Maputo.
They could have stayed where they studied, but they  went  back.  They  went
back to create hope in their own country.  They  did  not  go  back  because
there were ample opportunities to make money, they went back  because  of  a
sense of purpose and loyalty.

If young people can be bright-eyed and enthusiastic about their own  country
and continent, then there is hope. Of course they could  have  talked  their
country down, complained about the poverty and lack of  infrastructure,  but
instead they decided to do something about it.

That is what our country and our continent need. To take pride in one's  own
is the first step towards  rebuilding  and  bringing  about  a  renaissance.
[Applause.] [Interjections.]

'n Voorvereiste vir sukses in Afrika  is  florerende  veelparty-demokrasieë.
Daar is baie  suksesverhale  in  Afrika,  soos  Nigerië  en  Ghana  waar  'n
geskiedenis van onderdrukking en militêre staatsgrepe plek  gemaak  het  vir
gereelde demokratiese verkiesings, verantwoordbare burgerlike  regering  en,
in die geval van Ghana, vreedsame verandering van een demokratiese  regering
na 'n ander. In 1989 was daar slegs drie veelparty-demokrasieë in  Suidelike
Afrika, vandag is daar 12. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[A  prerequisite  for  success   in   Africa   is   flourishing   multiparty
democracies. There are many success stories  in  Africa,  like  Nigeria  and
Ghana, where a history of oppression and military coups d'état made way  for
regular democratic elections, accountable civil government and, in the  case
of Ghana, peaceful transition from one democratic government to another.  In
1989 there were only three multiparty democracies in Southern Africa,  today
there are 12.]

The renaissance that we would like to see in Africa must also happen in  our
own country. The greatest contribution we as  a  country  can  make  to  the
success of the African Renaissance is to  establish  a  democracy  based  on
constructive   dialogue   between   different   partners.   [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

A renaissance needs architects and then it needs builders. A renaissance  is
never popular because it questions long-held beliefs and  very  often  those
beliefs are prejudices dressed up  as  beliefs  and  convictions  and,  very
often, as principles. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

A renaissance also needs more than lip service.  A  renaissance  means  that
there is no place to hide. One has to make one's  own  choices,  if  one  is
part of it and one wants to build,  then  one  has  to  make  one's  choice.
[Interjections.]

The faint-hearted will always find excuses. It is not the right  time,  they
will say. They do not like the other people who will  be  co-builders,  they
will  say.  Some  will  even  say  nobody  gave  you  a  mandate  to  build.
[Laughter.] [Interjections.] [Applause.] While leaders who do not know  that
they have the mandate to build, will never recognise such a mandate even  if
they got it on a silver tray. [Laughter.] [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Our South African renaissance is waiting to happen.  The  bricks  have  been
delivered, the  mortar  is  ready,  and  the  architect's  plans  have  been
delivered to the site. It is time to make a choice. Either one  is  part  of
the building team,  or  one  will  stay  in  his  political  shack  forever.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

We cannot have a successful renaissance if it is only owned by some  of  the
people. It must be owned by all the people.  The  South  African  liberation
puts a choice before every South African. Either one  accepts  it  with  its
full implications, becomes a constructive builder and joins  hands,  or  one
condemns oneself to the darkness of permanent  bitterness  and  longing  for
the past. Either one's heart is in the new South Africa or it is not.  There
is no in-between. One cannot be here in body but not  in  soul.  [Applause.]
It does not mean that we should all think,  act  and  look  alike,  or  even
belong to the same party. It is about the way we interact with each other.

Unfortunately, opposition in our country has been reduced to an angry  white
voice, mudslinging and character assassination.  [Applause.]  Our  country's
multiparty system requires better opposition,  opposition  that  understands
what is in the country's best  interests,  not  one  of  sound  bites,  spin
doctoring and increasing racial polarisation. [Applause.]

White, coloured and Indian South Africans want  to  take  hands  with  black
South Africans in a common nationhood. They want to be part  of  the  debate
on  the  future.  There  are  two  clear  choices  for  members   of   those
communities: They either take the road of banging their  heads  against  the
wall in anger, or that  of  opening  up  a  proper,  constructive  dialogue.
Opposition should never be a sterile voice  based  on  fear  and  anger.  If
opposition is not about ideas and endeavouring to convince others  of  those
ideas based on sound intellectual considerations, then it becomes a  cynical
game of scoring debating points, which have no relation with the real  lives
of millions of our people out there. [Applause.]

I always find it astonishing that people  who  have  never  in  their  lives
experienced poverty, never wondered how their budgets would balance  at  the
end of the month, never had to explain to their children  that  there  would
be no holiday this year, never had to explain to their children  that  there
would be no money for a new pair of shoes, never had to  wonder  were  their
next meal would come from, can pretend to stand up here and speak on  behalf
of the poor. [Applause.]

What we need in our country is a situation where all of us are part  of  our
own renaissance. We can do it from different parties, but we must all be  on
the building site. We cannot be co-architects of the African Renaissance  if
the South African renaissance is not a success.

What we need is a new pact between people who  still  have  some  unfinished
business between them, between black South Africans  and  Afrikaans-speaking
people. [Interjections.] Many of those members  will  not  understand  that.
[Applause.] Many unspoken words still hang in the air. The African  soil  is
not a mere commercial commodity to us. To us it contains a message of  where
we belong. Our unfinished business is not limited to the past;  it  is  also
about the future. We are on the verge of a process  where  people  will  not
ask where they  come  from  historically,  they  will  have  to  answer  the
question, where are we going now?

Our South African renaissance must open a new  chapter  that  somehow  could
not have been opened up to  now.  Before  the  Anglo-Boer  War  started,  an
incident happened in the old Transvaal  Parliament  in  November  1899.  The
message contained in the exchange of words  between  President  Paul  Kruger
and General De La Rey is a philosophy which is  applicable  each  and  every
day in our country.

Paul Kruger, one of the great men in our history, proposed a war. De La  Rey
cautioned and insisted that more  effort  be  made  to  find  a  settlement.
Kruger taunted him with the charge of cowardice and De La Rey  replied:  ``I
shall do my duty as Parliament decides'', and, looking  Kruger  straight  in
the eye, he ended, ``and you, you will see me in the field fighting for  our
independence long after you and your party, who make war with  your  mouths,
have fled the country''. [Interjections.]

Our South African renaissance, if it is  co-owned,  will  succeed.  It  will
have to be about taking to its logical conclusion  what  the  architects  of
the new South Africa had in mind. They did not  have  in  mind  perpetuating
old divisions under new names. What they had in mind was that the new  South
Africa must be different from the  old  one.  They  had  in  mind  that  the
children of the new South Africa would break new ground. They certainly  had
in mind that people would have the courage to take on the future  and  break
out of old moulds and that certainly is what we need  to  explore  together.
[Applause.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Madam Speaker, hon President, Chairperson of  the  NCOP,  that
is a hard act to follow. If the hon the President would allow me to  address
Comrade Van Schalkwyk, I must say that a week is a  long  time  in  politics
and we  always  knew  that  the  hon  member  did  not  belong  in  the  DP.
[Interjections.]

Our hard work has come of age, but it feels as though our struggle has  only
just begun. Half of the world's population lives on less  than  two  dollars
per day. About 20 billion people, as we stand here today and talk,  live  on
less than two dollars per day. Nkwame Nkrumah's vision of the change of  the
African personality from one beleaguered by hunger, pain,  disease,  slavery
and internal turmoil to the African personality that is strong,  prosperous,
resilient, dignified, with a burning desire to resolutely  break  the  cycle
of deprivation is fast becoming a reality.

A deep awakening has inspired the new partnership founding  document.  These
are words that resonate in the mind.  Words  that  say  that  `Africans  are
appealing neither for the further entrenchment  of  dependency  through  aid
nor for marginal concessions'. There are words that say `resources  required
to launch a global war on poverty exist in abundance.'
What is required is bold and imaginative leadership, a  leadership  that  is
genuinely committed to a sustained human development effort. Words that  say
`we will determine our own destiny'. And indeed  deafening  words  that  say
`Africa is an indispensable resource base of minerals, oil, gas and also  of
environmental, archeological, palaeontological, and cultural  resources  for
the use of all humanity, and we will no longer  allow  our  people  and  our
continent to be plundered and to be raped'.

We say these words rationally. We say them loudly and we say  them  clearly.
To quote a recent cliché:


  We say to the whole world including our sceptical fellow South  Africans:
  You are either with us or you are against us in this effort.

Many processes will be at work to achieve  our  objectives.  None,  however,
can be more important than the need to strengthen our domestic  economy  and
the domestic economies of African countries throughout  the  continent.  The
domestic economies will eventually measure whether we have achieved  success
and will truly be the test of whether we indeed charter our destiny  on  our
own terms.

The levels of unemployment, children dying of hunger and  disease,  and  the
socioeconomic needs of our people are all barometers of the extent to  which
we would have achieved the African Renaissance.

We have done exceptionally well in  capturing  export  markets  since  1994.
This brought about much-needed  foreign  earnings  and  balance  of  payment
relief. However, access to the markets of Europe, the US and  the  Far  East
are not enough if this reciprocal eradication of trade barriers will end  up
in imports being higher than exports in our country.

In other words, the question that we  need  to  ask  ourselves  is:  Is  our
economy and that of SADC and other countries in Africa ready  to  take  full
advantage of the benefits  of  the  South  African-EU  agreement,  Agoa  and
Mecusol, or are we simply opening ourselves up  for  further  imbalances  by
the more powerful production processes of the northern hemisphere?

The answer to this question lies in our ability  to  empower  and  integrate
our people in our democratic economy to perform and produce at the  same  or
higher levels of production than the economies of  the  northern  hemisphere
with whom we have concluded agreements.

This is what reciprocal  agreements  do,  and  any  honest  assessment  will
acknowledge that this is a tall order against developed industrial  nations.
Our lower exchange rates  are  beneficial  to  exports  from  a  balance  of
payment point of view, but nothing will certify our  ability  to  meet  open
trade routes with success more than a strong, bustling  domestic  industrial
base. Large corporations and  dominant  market  players  cannot  meet  these
challenges alone, nor  will  old-style  protectionist  measures  buffer  the
ruthlessness of predatory international trade practices.

In  order  to  achieve  credible  and  capable  implementation  of  the  new
partnership, the development process must be one  of  real  empowerment  and
self-reliance, truly making us the architects of own sustained development.

A successful African Renaissance must delve into  the  detail,  for  therein
lies  the  devil.  Deep  inside  our  economic  structure,  we   must   find
constructive ways of leading not just a few icons, but the critical mass  of
our people into the mainstream of the economy.

There is a hungry mass of entrepreneurs in our  country  who  can  be  found
selling vegetables and goods  at  Park  Station,  establishing  village  co-
operatives in Thohoyandou, digging for diamonds in the  Northern  Cape,  and
working in the land of the Free State.

There are big black businessmen and women controlling and  running  platinum
mines, goldfields and large ICT countries. There are people with  downstream
beneficiation  businesses,  people  with  new  ideas  for   production   and
employment, and every manner and hue of micro and small  business  in  South
Africa. At the last count in 1998, there were 1,2  million  SMMEs  in  South
Africa, and there is no doubt that, since then, the ranks have grown.

Great barriers exist for our success. We  still  have  conservative  banking
institutions that fail to finance black entrepreneurs. In addition to  that,
our R15 billion microfinancing industry still provides 98% of the loans  for
consumptive and not productive purposes, simply making the poor  poorer  due
to the high interest rates induced by exemptions that  we  have  granted  in
terms of the Usury Act of 1968.

Only a disappointing 2% of the total microfinance  loans  go  to  productive
loans for small businesses and entrepreneurs  that  create  jobs  and  entry
into  economic  life.  These  are  figures  that  we   received   from   the
microfinancing industry itself in recent conferences we held with them.

SMMEs are relegated to the fringes of the  economy  and  are  treated  as  a
begging and vagabond sector of our country. Yet, in a  number  of  countries
in Europe and the Far East, we have witnessed economies that are  driven  by
SMMEs. Some of these countries are achieving growth rates of between 6%  and
9,5%. In some of these countries, 80% of the GDP is earned by  SMMEs.  SMMEs
generate employment, broaden the footprint of entry into the  real  economy,
stimulate vibrancy and growth, and are the last line of defence against  the
vagaries of a fragile global economy because, in the  first  instance,  they
rely on domestic trade before they trade on the export markets.

Our people have  earned  their  dignity  through  decades  of  struggle  for
political freedom, but the economic  struggle  of  knocking  on  doors,  day
after day, for finance and support to start up and expand their  enterprises
continues. They are shunted from pillar to post in the most humiliating  and
undignified manner, and this continues as we speak today.

Our people are ready for hard and honest work with  sleeves  rolled  up  and
hoes in hand. They are excited about the possibilities and they  have  given
an overwhelming mandate to Parliament and Government  in  order  to  achieve
these objectives.

We stand  before  the  hon  the  President  as  members  of  Parliament  and
committees dealing with economic and related  sectors.  We  stand  ready  to
fully  endorse  direct  Government  interventions  on  these   matters.   As
Parliament, we will approve tough regulatory frameworks for  bringing  banks
and big business in line and on board. We will endorse well-targeted,  fast-
tracked  initiatives  to  empower  and  mentor  black  business  and   SMMEs
generally.

We will continue to support stronger Cabinet initiatives for  food  security
and the release of arable  land  to  black  farmers.  We  will  ensure  that
nothing stands in the way of granting prospecting and mining rights  to  our
black prospectors. We  will  support  all  efforts  to  bridge  the  digital
divide. We will further entrench plans to drive  Government  procurement  to
black businesses and SMMEs.
We will support direct interventions to  increase  levels  of  productivity.
But most importantly, as  Parliament,  we  will  appropriate  the  necessary
funds that Government will require to directly support  black  business  and
SMMEs to offset market failures in the SMME sector in South  Africa.  During
the course of next year we will engage the economic affairs  departments  of
the nine provinces to, with local governments, further this campaign.

Finally, as we work towards success, we will go with the  President  to  the
parliaments of Africa to advocate and support similar  strategies  in  other
African economies. This pledge we make for the New Partnership for  Africa's
Development.

We have witnessed the President's urgency and the  urgency  of  our  people,
and we dare not fail. [Applause.]

Gen B H HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker,  hon  President  and  colleagues,  the  UDM
congratulates  President  Mbeki  on  his  pioneering   initiative   in   the
establishment of the New Partnership for Africa's Development. I would  also
like to express the UDM's support for the peace  initiatives  taken  by  our
country in Burundi.

The Minister of Defence must now monitor the involvement of our soldiers  in
Burundi closely, especially in the light of threats from Tutsi  rebels,  and
stop being preoccupied  with  the  disintegration  of  the  New  NP  and  DA
alliance. [Laughter.] They should leave that to the  voters  to  decide  on.
[Interjections.]

Ndiyakubona Terror ukuba usebenzile mfana, kwaye  ndimvile  lo  mfana  usuka
apha ukuba umrhabulisile mpela. [Kwahlekwa.] [I  can  see  that  Terror  has
done his job very well and that he has  effectively  educated  the  previous
speaker. [Laughter.]]

The objectives of the African Union to  realise  sustained  development  and
improvement of the quality of life in  Africa,  with  the  co-operation  and
support of  the  developed  North,  have  underlined  the  founding  of  the
Organisation of African Unity in the 1960s.
The Pan-Africanism of George Padmore,  which  was  later  developed  into  a
liberation philosophy by the likes of Kwame Nkrumah, was the  forerunner  of
the African Renaissance which is driving the New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development. At its inception it strove  for  and  succeeded  in  liberating
Africa from the clutches of colonialism.

The foundation of the Organisation of African Unity was an endeavour by  the
newly independent African states to form an African power  bloc  that  could
leverage a reluctant former colonial  group  of  nations,  who  still  clung
tenaciously to the material spoils and advantages of the  colonial  era,  to
equitably spread the resources and the benefits of the  developed  economies
of the North to the underdeveloped African continent.

In doing so, they had hoped to enter into some arrangement that  would  make
possible the development of African infrastructure and economies  and  carve
out a niche for  the  African  states  in  the  international  community  of
nations. This was not to be. The problems which faced the OAU are  identical
to those facing the African Union today, and will  bedevil  the  efforts  of
the New Partnership for Africa's Development.

It was not in the material or economic interests of the developed powers  of
the North to promote foreign policies that would  transfer  surplus  capital
to the former colonies to  develop  an  indigenous  economic  capacity  that
could lead to self-sufficiency in those territories.

At the close of the last century and currently we are  still  struggling  to
structure mutually beneficial trade agreements, because self-interest  still
characterises  our  negotiations   and   agreements,   notwithstanding   the
grandiose platitudes in our binational protocols.

Classical scholars, who have studied  and  analysed  the  vicious  cycle  of
underdevelopment in the former colonies in Africa, agree that it is  in  the
nature of the relationship between the economies of the developed  metropole
and the periphery to perpetuate a dependency  status  on  the  part  of  the
periphery, in order  to  sustain  the  advanced  levels  of  development  of
metropolitan economies. If it was in the interests of Gatt  or  the  WTO  to
transfer direct investment to the emerging economies in Africa in  order  to
see meaningful development, they would have done so long ago.

Africa also shares a large measure of responsibility  for  underdevelopment.
African states have squandered  resources  in  senseless  internecine  wars,
graft  and  corruption.  The  mindless  political  conflicts   and   endemic
despotism have dissipated the creative energies of the continent. We need  a
complete reorientation and change of attitude at home and abroad if  we  are
to achieve the objectives of the New Partnership for Africa's Development.

First of all, Africa must reconcile the interests of the  individual  states
with those of the  bigger  whole.  The  first  step  is  to  develop  viable
regional economies in the existing regional  entities  such  as  SACD,  East
Africa, the Great Lakes, West Africa and Maghreb.

The  infrastructure  of  these  regions  must  be  developed  to  facilitate
intraregional and  interregional  trade,  which  will  expand  our  domestic
markets and enhance economic self-sufficiency. We must aim  to  establish  a
regulatory  framework  for  continental  internal  trade  and  economic  co-
operation, by means of which we can evolve into a  regional  or  continental
power bloc that  will  have  the  clout  to  bargain  effectively  with  the
developed North. South-South trade and economic co-operation should also  be
optimally developed to complement this new plan.

Africa  has  substantially  contributed  to  the  wealth  creation  of   the
developed world by supplying raw materials to  these  countries'  industries
at prices set by the buyers. The problem of the cost of African  commodities
is a familiar story in the North-South trade interaction. The time has  come
for Africa to be self-reliant, rather than expect favours from abroad.  This
will begin  when  we  add  value  to  our  raw  materials  locally,  thereby
expanding our manufacturing base in order to generate the requisite  revenue
for the development of our indigenous economies. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Madam Speaker, President, the march  of
the leaders and people of South Africa towards the  eradication  of  poverty
and the redirection of their continent on a path of sustainable  growth  and
development is gaining momentum. The determination of Africa to forge a  new
framework of interacting with the rest of the world  is  being  turned  into
concrete institutions and action. This is for us, by us. Those  members  who
follow fashion trends know this is what Fubu stands for: For us, by us.

As we speak about partnerships today, I would  like  to  take  a  moment  to
salute a partner with whom I have enjoyed a relationship of substance,  Duma
Nkosi. [Applause.] It is his last day in Parliament today, as he  leaves  to
lead the people of Ekurhuleni as mayor. We wish him good luck  and  we  hope
his oustanding work will continue in that sphere of government. [Applause.]

No one in this House or in our country or  even  in  Africa  and  the  world
doubts the energy and commitment of our President in the leadership that  he
has shown in pulling this initiative together. We also  want  to  thank  and
congratulate Presidents Obasanjo, Bouteflika and other presidents  who  have
demonstrated great vision and, at the same time, a great sense  of  urgency.
The amount of work and energy that they have put into this project within  a
relatively short space of time, if one knows how government works, is  quite
amazing. [Applause.] I think there are few companies, even  in  the  private
sector, who could say that one can  pull  together  a  whole  continent  and
bring about a product of this quality within such short time, while, at  the
same time, running their countries.

Hon members will also recall that the majority of Africa's  people  live  in
rural areas. The continent's 722 million people, of whom 452 million are  in
rural areas and approximately 300 million are poverty-stricken and  live  on
$1 per day, need to be the major  beneficiaries  of  this  initiative.  This
means that the agrarian system must necessarily be one of the  main  pillars
in the transformation of the African economies.  The  objectives  of  Nepad,
with  respect  to  agriculture,  are:  to  improve   the   productivity   of
agriculture with particular attention to small  and  disadvantaged  farmers,
including women; to ensure food security for all  people  and  increase  the
access of the poor to adequate  food  and  nutrition;  to  promote  measures
against natural resource degradation and encourage production  methods  that
are environmentally sustainable, and to integrate the rural  poor  into  the
market economy and provide them with better access to  export  markets.  The
example of  Lesotho  demonstrates  what  a  small  country  can  do  if  its
environment is more enabling. Another  objective  of  Nepad  is  to  develop
Africa into a net exporter of  agricultural  products,  which  we  have  the
capacity to do, and to become a strategic  player  in  agricultural  science
and technology development. These objectives  are  underpinned  by  concrete
plans, programmes and possibilities.

As far as energy is concerned, the central role of  efficient  and  reliable
infrastructure as part of the energy basket of  services  that  we  need  to
provide is critical in the growth and  development  process.  Infrastructure
not only sustains economic growth but  also  increases  competitiveness  and
enhances the quality of life. It is both the consumption  of  goods  and  an
input in the production process of nearly every economic sector.  No  modern
economy can survive without a  high-  quality  reliable  source  of  energy.
Energy, together with information  and  communications  technology  or  ICT,
transport, water, and its sanitation are the core components that  form  the
integrated approach to infrastructure development and its  provision  within
the New Partnership for Africa's Development.

Even though Africa represents  13%  of  the  world's  population,  we  still
consume only 3% of the total installed capacity  of  energy  that  could  be
available to us. These are the challenges that have made  it  critical  that
the infrastructure sector be given a high  priority.  We  have  included  in
that work ICT, energy, transport, water and  sanitation.  There  are  common
issues which are prerequisites if the necessary finance is to  be  attracted
into infrastructure to regenerate and expand networks so as  to  meet  these
challenges.

We have also focused on the need to  mobilise  sustainable  finance  through
using grant and concessional finance to mitigate risk in the short term  and
promote  public-private  partnerships  as  the  most  promising  vehicle  to
attract investors. An elaboration of these initiatives is  included  in  the
documents that underpin the New Partnership for Africa's Development.

I would just like to give hon members examples of some of the projects  that
we are  vigorously  following.  These  include  the  development  of  energy
information systems and databases, because it has been recognised  that  the
failure of statistical  systems  to  respond  to  data  needs  has  hampered
developments in South Africa.

We are busy with the harmonisation of a regulatory framework in the  African
energy sectors, and we have also worked very hard to pull together  regional
transmission grid interconnectors, and there is  a  true  possibility  today
that we will see a transmission that can move from Cape to Cairo.  Different
interconnectors, one of which will link up Zambia, Tanzania and Kenya,  will
ensure that energy generated in South Africa, in Zimbabwe and in  Mozambique
will be able to power the people in the east and even in the  north  of  the
continent. Of course, we have also paid attention to  the  critical  use  of
renewable  energies  -  water,  solar  energy,  wind  and  waves  -  in  our
continent.

There is also the critical sector of mining.  Africa  continues  to  be  the
greatest producer of mineral resources in the world. However,  we  have  not
benefited to the extent to which we could from these natural resources.  The
potential build-up of African economies is, to a  large  extent,  linked  to
mining and many of these future developments, and is, in no  small  measure,
dependent on a vibrant, flourishing mining industry to  provide  much-needed
foreign currency and employment. However, without value adding  as  well  as
the diversification of the mineral resources  that  are  available  in  each
country, we will not  be  able  to  realise  the  advantages  of  these  raw
materials which are also an unrenewable resource.

In 1999 Africa produced 80% of the world's  platinum,  55%  of  the  world's
chromite, 55% of the world's diamonds and 49% of the world's palladium,  and
so the list goes on. In the diversification as well as the value adding,  we
will be ensuring that these raw materials that we have sold,  and  therefore
exported jobs to other countries, are now kept, to provide for  our  people.
Very  critical,  especially  in  this  industry,  is   the   ownership   and
involvement  of  Africans  in  the  development  and  exploration  of  these
projects.

As we therefore increase and diversify the basket of  services  as  well  as
add value, we would have to pay greater attention to the  ownership  profile
in these sectors. I have no doubt that the leadership in  business,  in  the
sectors that I am involved in, is ready to run with  the  challenge,  as  it
will be critical to bringing  the  private  sector  full  steam  into  these
projects. I have no doubt that Sapia, the Chamber of Mines,  Eskom  and  the
many such significant players are ready to take up the challenge.

Nepad is not a dream. It is a vision that is  not  just  unfolding,  but  is
also happening [Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, hon  President  and  hon  members,  African
leaders should be applauded for the New Africa Initiative based on a  common
vision to, among other things, get rid of poverty and place their  countries
on a path of sustainable growth and development. For this vision  to  become
a reality, firm commitments have to be made  by  all  stakeholders  to  good
governance, democracy, the rule of law, human rights, fiscal discipline  and
accountability. All African leaders who are part  of  this  new  partnership
must hold one another accountable. They must understand  that  although  the
ideal situation would be one of equal benefit for all partners, the  reality
would be different. There must be equal dedication and effort from all role-
players to make this new partnership work.
A good question for us South Africans to ask is:  Where  do  we  start?  The
ACDP suggests that all our efforts, dedication and commitment  should  first
be to make South Africa work and reflect all the principles that we want  to
see in our immediate region. SADC countries must be  our  primary  areas  of
concern and influence. Because of our limited resources, we cannot act  like
``big brother'' to the rest of Africa. Charity begins  at  home.  Before  we
speak about continental  unity,  we  must  talk  about  regional  unity.  We
believe that regional co-operation will best position us and  strengthen  us
in our vision of continental co-operation.

Turning to South Africa's involvement in a peacekeeping mission in  Burundi,
I wish to ask the following questions: Firstly, who will  be  funding  these
military operations in Burundi? [Interjections.] Although  the  UN  Security
Council gave  its  support  to  the  South  African  peacekeeping  force  in
Burundi, it has not endorsed or authorised our troops under a  UN  umbrella.
This means that the UN will not pay for this operation. If we are  expecting
any donor funds, which countries have committed or confirmed that they  will
be contributing, and  how  much  will  they  be  contributing?  This  is  an
important question, especially when we consider the fact that  no  provision
exists in the Defence allocation for participating in such an operation.

Secondly, it was  reported  in  the  media  that  the  pro-Tutsi  Union  for
National Progress Party in Burundi has  called  on  all  its  supporters  to
attack South African troops on their arrival in the  war-torn  country.  The
party's chairperson, Charles Mukasi, is alleged  to  have  declared  war  on
what he calls foreign aggression. Can the President assure this  House  that
we are not imposing ourselves on people who do  not  need  our  presence  in
their country?

Thirdly, how long will our troops be deployed in  Burundi?  [Interjections.]
The ACDP  will  not  support  spending  millions  of  the  taxpayer's  money
indefinitely on an operation that  does  not  benefit  South  Africans,  the
majority of whom are still living in poverty. There must be  a  deadline  on
this costly and dangerous exercise. There must be a  deadline  and  that  is
for sure. [Interjections.]

Fourthly, is the President satisfied about the personal safety and  security
of our armed forces in Burundi? If  things  go  wrong  and  our  troops  are
attacked or some are even taken hostage, which is a possibility,  are  there
any concrete emergency withdrawal plans  in  place  to  evacuate  them?  The
President must assure the nation in his response that  South  Africans  will
not have to pay millions of rands for an operation which  is  outside  their
borders, when there are so many needs at home, and that their loved ones  on
this mission will not be exposed to  death  in  a  conflict  that  does  not
directly affect them. [Interjections.]

The question has become even more serious, after  hearing  the  Minister  of
Defence saying that our armed forces went to Burundi  without  a  cease-fire
in place. Their security must become our concern.

The success of this new partnership for Africa's  Development  will  require
openness,  courage,  and  a  vigorous  and  robust  debates  among  members.
Confronting issues, when necessary, and even one another, will  have  to  be
part of the deal. In this case, South  Africa  will  have  to  answer  these
questions because many people are asking them and they want answers.

Lastly, the ACDP suggests that an international trust  fund  be  established
for the redevelopment of a post-Mugabe Zimbabwe. There must be resources  to
help rebuild the economy and social structure of  that  country,  once  free
and fair elections have enabled a new government to come  into  power.  This
is the responsibility of African leaders and only they should do this.

We further suggest that they test  the  future  effectiveness  of  this  New
Partnership for Africa's Development in our region by helping to bring  good
governance, democracy, the rule of law, human rights, fiscal discipline  and
accountability in our  region  and  specifically  in  Zimbabwe.  [Applause.]
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mr Chairperson,  Mr  President,  Madam  Speaker
and hon members, I am not sure that the member who spoke a few  moments  ago
before me can really claim to ask those  questions  on  behalf  of  a  great
number of people. I am not sure that the questions are worthy  of  a  debate
of this nature. I believe the steps taken are absolutely vital to  being  an
imperative of this partnership that we are here to debate today.  We  cannot
deny a responsibility that we should have, as a  country,  and  as  MPs,  to
ensure that we support efforts  for  peace.  I  believe  that  that  is  the
direction in which we should proceed.

The joy of participating in a debate that is focused  on  Africa  cannot  be
overemphasised. This process of a partnership, led by leaders of Africa,  is
a positive and auspicious step forward for our  people  and  our  continent.
The responsibility its intentions place on elected representatives  mandates
a sober and honest reflection  on  all  the  challenges  and  on  the  steps
necessary to making the agreed aspirations a reality.

While contemplating the form of contribution  to  place  before  this  joint
sitting, I reread the book Beyond Freedom: Letters to Olusegun  Obasanjo.  I
was particularly struck by a small part of Richard Joseph's  letter  in  the
chapter ``How are hopes mended and dreams rebuilt?'' Joseph recalls part  of
the text of a lecture he had given at a book launch in 1991 and repeats  for
Gen Obasanjo in  the  letter  his  thoughts  and  feelings  on  leaving  the
University of Ibadan in 1979. He recalls:


  I felt I had become a part, albeit a small one, of  the  history  of  the
  greatest agglomeration of African people on the globe. Despite  Nigeria's
  travails, I believed strongly  that  not  just  political  triumphs,  but
  surely economic, social and cultural ones were ahead.


  Above my desk at my university in the United States, I proudly attached a
  clipping with the statement  by  Gen  Obasanjo  that  he  fully  expected
  Nigeria to be among `` the greatest nations in  the  world  by  the  year
  2000''. In time, that newspaper clipping yellowed  and  became  tattered.
  Eventually, I took it down and threw it into my wastebasket. But I  never
  threw away that dream, that belief.

He continues in his letter: ``What would I say five years later  about  that
dream, that belief?'' We, hon members, may be faced with a similar  question
in five years' time.  Conditions  at  present  on  our  continent,  and  the
existence of this new partnership and plan, support our view today  that  we
can positively anticipate that in five years' time a great deal of  progress
will have been made.

In order to act as responsible public  representatives,  we  must,  however,
address the question: What set of conditions  will  maximise  our  potential
for success with Nepad? A bold and seemingly arrogant response is tabled  as
a first attempt.

The first step for our continent has to be a deliberate and open  review  of
the legal frameworks that guide national  practice.  Our  continent  has  to
engage in a process of constitutional review to restore faith  in  democracy
and to create conditions that may optimise national belief  in  and  support
of this new African partnership.

This is not a simplistic  assertion  that  South  Africa  is  advantaged  by
virtue of her new Constitution. Rather, it is a reference to the need for  a
close look at every aspect that should inform Africa's new agenda.

Given what has been said  in  the  partnership  about  good  governance  and
participatory democracy, it is  obvious  that  constitutions  that  fail  to
empower parliaments, that  fail  to  protect  people,  that  fail  to  guide
national action will probably be a hindrance to Africa's plans.

As the late Chief Justice Mahomed said of a constitution:


  The constitution of a nation is not simply a statute  which  mechanically
  defines the structures of government and the relations between government
  and the governed. It is a ``mirror reflecting the  national  soul'',  the
  identification  of  the  ideals  and  aspirations  of   a   nation,   the
  articulation of the  values  bonding  its  people  and  disciplining  its
  government. The spirit and  tenor  of  the  constitution  must  therefore
  preside and permeate the processes ...

A new partnership, with the expected participation of  diverse  peoples  and
countries, requires legal frameworks that define that  national  soul,  that
articulate ideals, and that promote the values inherent in Nepad.  The  full
participation of each of our continent's citizens requires  frameworks  that
enhance the dignity of workers, women  and  all  citizens  and  enhance  the
restoration or the strengthening of  human  rights.  Institutions  of  civil
society and democratic governance have to  be  granted  life  by  frameworks
that are shaped by and aimed at giving it practical effect to  each  of  the
objectives of this new plan.

Fortunately, in the partnership  document,  it  is  indicated  that  various
needs assessments and analyses will be carried out  to  prepare  the  ground
for action. It is vital to include constitutional renewal in that analysis.

Joseph continues his letter to General Obasanjo by saying that he  knows  of
many nations that promise greatness and fail to achieve  it.  In  some,  the
spark was rekindled and they  went  on  to  achieve  greatness.  Into  which
category, he asks, will Nigeria fall? Into  which  category,  we  ask,  will
Africa fall?

We are fortunate that  today,  as  Africans,  we  can  deliver  a  confident
response to Joseph and  many  others.  The  spark  has  been  rekindled  and
Obasanjo, Mbeki, Bouteflika, Wadey, Mubarak and all  our  leaders,  and  our
Parliament and parliamentarians here today, say that we cannot let nor  will
we allow - the spark to go out and fade away.

We wish the President and our Parliament success in all  our  endeavours  to
rebuild our great continent and to give  life  to  the  aspirations  of  the
people of Africa. [Applause.]

Mr  P  A  MATTHEE:  Chairperson,  let   us   get   South   Africa   working.
[Interjections.] That is the motto under  which  I  was  elected  into  this
Parliament. This is a cause I have always strived  to  make  a  contribution
to. I did not want to pay attention to my colleagues here, but when I  heard
the shouts from them, I could not help thinking back only a  few  years  ago
when the former Conservative Party members scolded us as  traitors  when  we
were busy creating the new South Africa. The mindset seems to be the same.

Let us get Africa working. This is basically the  goal  of  the  New  Africa
Initiative. Everyone of us should enthusiastically and passionately help  to
achieve all the goals of this New Africa Initiative, not only because it  is
the right thing to do, but also because it  is  in  the  interest  of  every
South African that we succeed in building a better Africa for  all  Africa's
children.

I note that one of the institutional reforms  that  the  African  Initiative
leadership will focus on in order to strengthen political governance is  the
promotion of participatory decision-making. I specifically welcome this.  We
in the New NP said in our 1999 election manifesto that, and  I  quote:  ``We
want to create an inclusive government  where  political  responsibility  is
shared to get South Africa working.'' [Applause]

Volgens prof Willie Esterhuysen hou vernuwing in Suid-Afrika  asook  op  die
vasteland  van  Afrika  breedweg  in  die  vestiging  en  uitbouing  van  'n
samelewingsorde waarin vrede, vryheid,  geregtigheid  en  veiligheid  ervaar
sal word. Een van die onderafdelings van hierdie ideaal  is  die  verbreding
en  verdieping  van  ons  demokrasie  as   'n   uitvoerproduk   na   Afrika.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[According to Prof Willie Esterhuysen renewal in South Africa as well as  on
the continent of Africa broadly implies the establishing and building  of  a
societal  order  in  which  peace,  freedom,  justice   and   security   are
experienced. One of the subdivisions of this ideal  is  the  broadening  and
deepening of our democracy as an export product to Africa.]
The highly respected academic Prof Hermann Gilliomee says that  in  contrast
to electoralism - that is, democracy  as  a  set  of  procedures  which  can
easily be debased - there is a truer form of democracy  in  which  democracy
is the balancing of the views of the majority and  the  minority.  Obviously
in some cases the view of the majority will have  greater  weight.  But  the
essence of this type of democracy, which is defined  in  the  book  Majority
Rule by Elaine Speech, is the quality of being completely responsive to  all
its citizens.

The procedural model of democracy asks us to stand aside, to  oppose  others
and stress differences and to exclude  others.  The  co-operative  model  of
democracy asks one to include others, to stress similarities, to  complement
others, to draw people together. This is the  type  of  democracy  that  not
only South Africa, but Africa desperately needs. [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Chairperson, Mr President, after Mr van Schalkwyk's  speech
and the previous speech, I am  really  tempted  to  read  from  a  newspaper
clipping from 1995. [Interjections.] The  heading  of  that  clipping  says:
Imbongi Viljoen's flirting with the ANC is a public disgrace. [Laughter.]

Dan sê die berig verder: [Then the report goes on to say:]


  Die speelse vryery tussen die twee partye is  op  sy  sigbaarste  wanneer
  genl Viljoen in die Parlement praat.  Hy  wy  gewoonlik  die  eerste  ses
  minute van sy toespraak daaraan om die ANC te prys en daarna word hy deur
  die  ANC-lede  toegejuig.  Dit  is  geen  wonder  dat  die  ANC  nou  van
  ``imbongi'' Viljoen praat.

That is just a reminder. I would like  to  start  with  a  quote  by  Robert
Kennedy:


  Some men see things as they are and say: Why? I dream things  that  never
  were and say: Why not?

As proud Africans, the FF fully supports the President in  this  initiative.
It remains a question to me what the Americans would call me, if  I  decided
to emigrate to the USA? Surely the correct description would be  an  African
American. The FF does not plan to emigrate in that sense. [Interjections.]

It is very important that this initiative must succeed - we may  not  get  a
second chance. The  world,  and  specifically  the  West  is  watching  with
scepticism, secretly predicting that we will fail.

A very important part of the success of this plan is that investors must  be
convinced to invest in South  Africa  and  in  Africa.  Investors  have  the
memories of elephants, the hearts of lambs and the legs of hares.

I  can  only  address  one  issue.  The  FF  believes  that   an   important
precondition for investment is  stability.  An  important  precondition  for
stability is democracy. In Africa,  guns  and  tanks  must  be  replaced  by
stability and democracy.

Tomorrow is the installation of a transitional government in  Burundi  -  it
is a first step, and my congratulations to the President as far as  that  is
concerned.

We need more debates and discussions on the political  problems  of  Africa.
Africa's diversity of people can be its  strongest  point.  At  the  moment,
when we talk about democracy, Africa's diversity is its weakest point.

It seems to me that the curse of Africa is the refusal to  tolerate  variety
and address and admit  this  diversity.  The  legacy  of  arbitrarily  drawn
boundaries gives rise to situations such as the DRC, where over  250  ethnic
groups exist.

Pres Mbeki's African initiative places emphasis on  the  democratisation  of
African states. Simple democracy with its winner takes all, cannot  work  in
the Congo, or in Burundi or in most African states. When three wolves and  a
lamb sit around a table and discuss what they must  eat  for  lunch:  Is  it
democracy? Is it democracy when they vote 3-1 to have the  lamb  for  lunch?
[Laughter.]

Real, modern democracy adopted for African conditions is what  we  need  for
successful democracy and stability in Africa. Diversity needs an  atmosphere
of accommodation and not  assimilation.  We  must  learn  the  lessons  from
Europe, where democracy brought ethnic problems, and  we  must  be  able  to
address them before we are in trouble. Then surely we can  say  with  Robert
Kennedy as he said in the end:


  We see things as they are and say: Why? I dream things  that  never  were
  and say: Why not?

Ms L M T XINGWANA: Chairperson, hon President, women in  Africa  have  waged
heroic struggles against all  forms  of  oppression  under  colonialism  and
apartheid. They have fought in the wars of liberation,  side  by  side  with
their men, to bring about the downfall of apartheid and  colonialism.  These
are the heroines who mobilised and  united  South  African  women  from  all
walks of life, black and white, rural and urban, young and  old,  under  the
Federation of South African Women to march to the Union  buildings  in  1956
against the pass laws.
This was a strong national women's  movement  that  was  not  based  on  the
western style  of  feminism,  but  was  a  movement  united  in  action  and
committed to the fight for  national  liberation  and  equality.  It  was  a
struggle  against  racism,  sexism  and  all   forms   of   oppression   and
exploitation. It is this strong movement,  under  the  Federation  of  South
African Women, that drew up the women's charter  of  1954  which  became  an
integral part of the Freedom Charter in 1955.

I salute the great heroines of our struggle, Lilian  Ngoyi,  Francis  Baart,
Helen Joseph,  Florence  Matomela,  Rahima  Moosa  and  Dorothy  Nyembe,  to
mention but a few. [Applause.] The struggle for  liberation  was  waged  not
only in South Africa, but throughout the African continent where women  also
fought and sacrificed their lives for freedom  and  democracy.  We  remember
Jamila Boupachas of Algeria, Josina Machel of Mozambique and  Ruth  Neto  of
Angola who were some of the great heroines of  the  liberation  struggle  of
Africa.

The strength, courage and calibre of leadership demonstrated  by  our  women
during the liberation struggle is our everlasting pride and inspiration.  We
also remember the widows of war and  apartheid  in  Africa  who  became  the
backbones of their families  and  the  liberation  movement.  They  are  the
unsung heroines of our struggle.

I wish to salute, at this stage, Mama Epainette Mbeki who represents one  of
those who were widowed long before  the  passing  on  of  her  husband,  our
father, the late Govan Mbeki, who was incarcerated in  the  apartheid  jails
in Robben Island while her children were forced into  exile.  As  a  mother,
teacher, community leader, Christian and  a  communist,  she  continues  the
struggle with the rural communities in the Transkei.

We have won the political battle today in  South  Africa  because  of  their
contribution and great sacrifices. We have a Constitution that is a  vehicle
to achieve the  objectives  of  a  nonracial  and  nonsexist  South  Africa.
Despite these achievements, we still have to continue with our  war  against
poverty, racism and sexism in our country.

Our Government  has  signed  and  ratified  some  of  the  most  progressive
international instruments including CEDAW, the Beijing Platform for  Action,
and the SADC Declaration on  Gender  and  Development.  We  trust  that  the
optional protocol on CEDAW will be signed  very  soon.  We  trust  that  the
provisions made in these instruments, including the  30%  representation  of
women pledged by the SADC  Heads  of  State  in  Malawi  in  1997,  will  be
implemented at all levels of our governments.

We urge our President, on behalf of all African women,  to  lobby  and  urge
all heads  of  state  in  Africa  to  adopt  and  endorse  the  30%  minimum
representation  of  women  in  the  African  Union   and   the   Pan-African
Parliament. [Applause.] African women are saying that to have one woman  out
of five to represent them in the new Pan-African Parliament is  taking  them
10 steps backwards since that is only 20% representation. We  are  demanding
at least two out of every five delegates for the Pan-African Parliament.

The major challenges facing Africa today are poverty, hunger, diseases,  war
and violence, especially against women and children. It  is  important  that
the new partnership for the advancement of Africa  should  prioritise  these
programmes and that  women  play  a  central  role  since  they  are  mostly
affected.

Last week, we met as women parliamentarians from the DRC,  Rwanda,  Burundi,
Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. They were visiting  our  Parliament.  Some
of the stories were  very  sad.  We  heard  from  Rwanda  that,  during  the
genocide, most of  the  women  that  were  raped  have  been  infected  with
HIV/Aids. In fact, 67% of those women who were  raped  during  the  genocide
have been infected and some of them died of Aids.

Most of the women from the Congo, Sierra Leone and Burundi also decried  the
marginalisation of women in their countries during  the  peace  negotiations
and in decision-making positions in their governments.  We  trust  that  the
African  Union  and  the  Pan-African  Parliament   will   not   allow   the
perpetuation of the suppression of women and  that  these  concerns  of  our
women will be addressed.

We believe that one of the major impediments against the  full  emancipation
of women in Africa today is the way we have socialised our girls.  The  girl
child is considered to be of less value in  most  of  our  communities.  The
girl child is inadequately educated. The girl child is still being  used  as
a sex and domestic slave in our own homes and in most of our  countries.  We
treat our boys as little kings and little heroes, little bosses  that  bully
everybody in our homes. The girls are the  small  wives  and  small  mothers
that must cook, clean and wash for everybody in the house.  Therefore,  this
is a challenge to us as women to begin to address the way in which we  bring
up our children.

We still suffer from the legacy of colonialism and apartheid where  we  were
declared minors from the cradle to the  grave.  This  happened  in  all  the
colonies and countries that were colonised in Africa. I trust that  some  of
the cultural practices that continue to oppress and  demean  women  will  be
deplored in the new African Union. I also believe that, through the  signing
of the protocol against all harmful practices, our children and  women  will
be protected in Africa.

Every effort should be made by all states in Africa as well as within  civil
society to remove all the  social  and  customary  barriers  which  militate
against the full development of women. Women, in many ways,  are  the  moral
conscience  of  our  continent.  They  have  displayed  their  courage   and
leadership, but also the organisational capacity to  lead  the  regeneration
and renewal of Africa. African women are ready for  the  African  Union  and
for the renewal and rebirth of Africa. They have  gone  through  the  labour
pains, and are now ready for the new baby. Africa's renaissance cannot  come
without Africa's women. [Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, the hon the  President,  hon  members,  by
way of introduction, let me begin  by  thanking  those  who  have  seen  the
importance of tackling African problems and challenges  at  the  continental
level, and for realising that the future of Africa  lies  in  the  hands  of
African people themselves.

We would like to thank President Thabo Mbeki for  initiating  the  plan  and
his wisdom in appreciating that South Africa alone  cannot  lead  Africa  to
recovery without the support of other countries and their leaders.  We  also
salute the governments of Nigeria, Algeria, Senegal and the  rest  who  have
deemed it fit to join forces in addressing Africa's  problems  and  to  face
new challenges jointly as a continent. There are those  who  would  like  to
see the plan to revive our continent fail before its  implementation.  There
those who are interpreting name changes attached to the plan as an  identity
crisis. However, we do not see it that way.

As long as the broader principles and strategies to  develop  our  continent
remain intact and are not compromised, we will support the plan  and  defend
it to the bitter end to see it succeed.

We would further like to view the main change as a sign that  the  new  plan
is subjected to constant debate to ensure  that  we  are  all  on  the  same
wavelength, with a shared vision on how the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development should unfold in achieving its stated objectives.

I have a word of advice for  the  architects  of  the  New  Partnership  for
Africa's Development: Continue to engage other countries that  are  not  yet
part of the programme; be sensitive in  your  approach,  but  be  honest  in
explaining that for the New Partnership for Africa's  Development  to  work,
we need to sacrifice and commit to the plan, unconditionally.

We know that there will be those who will be opposed to  the  plan,  because
they are benefiting from the status quo. We are, indeed, concerned  that  if
the plan disintegrates, we would have failed our African people who, by  and
large, are exposed to high levels of  unemployment,  poverty,  homelessness,
wars, diseases, illiteracy and lack of proper infrastructure.

 It is critical at this point in our history, where  the  world  is  on  the
brink of the third world war, to focus on and plan an important  role  as  a
continent, to be part of those committed to  preventing  war,  as  it  would
have serious repercussions for the New Partnership for Africa's  Development
plan and, indeed, for the rest of the world.

Since  one  of  the  core  focuses  of  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development is debt cancellation, it  is  imperative  that  this  particular
issue is addressed as a matter of priority to ensure  that  needy  countries
are relieved of their debt burden, which they  are  serving  with  resources
that should, instead, be directed at funding development projects.

For us, as a continent, to put forward a formidable and convincing  argument
why developed countries should heed  our  request  for  support,  we  should
first get our house in order and have our development priorities  right.  We
are confident that we will measure up to this challenge.

A new class of leadership in Africa is  emerging,  committed  to  democratic
principles and  peace.  We  must  also  thank  the  people  of  Burundi  for
realising that war hurts the poor and, indeed, we applaud them for  agreeing
to a transitional government. This is a positive sign that Africa  is  tired
of wars and is ready to  work  and  compete  with  other  continents  on  an
economic level, if given a chance.

It is also in the best interest of the G-8 countries  to  ensure  that  they
support Africa in her quest for recovery. It is not  impossible.  They  have
done it before, with other countries that are well developed today,  through
economic assistance. It is also important to highlight that we do  not  want
economic aid for the sake of it. We want to be independent.  We  should  ask
for investment.

History has proven that aid  leads  to  dependency,  as  opposed  to  direct
investment. It is time that the G-8  countries  listened  to  and  acted  on
Africa's cry for investment.

(Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[The Motswana of yesteryear said: ``Deny me food, but feed my  child.''  The
President's foresight and vision give us hope. He should  be  encouraged  to
continue leading Africa to greener pastures. Let there be rain!]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson, Comrade President and  hon
members, the New Partnership for Africa's Development is a plan  that  talks
directly to the political programme of the ANC.

There are many elements in both the Freedom Charter, the Reconstruction  and
Development Programme and our strategies and tactics that  accord  with  the
many  strategic  and  tactical  questions  that  the  new  partnership  plan
examines and seeks to respond to.

As an African country, South Africa is connected in every way  to  the  many
years of slavery, imperialism, colonialism and neocolonialism. We  will  use
our own freedom as part of the plan to defeat all remaining facets  of  that
era, including the scrapping of the heavy debt that the continent,  and  the
developing countries, owe to the developed world.

Throughout the years and during many conferences,  especially  the  past  50
national conferences and other key gatherings, ANC members  have  instructed
their leadership to play an active part in the  formulation  of  policy  and
programmes to help situate among all the world's  peoples  circumstances  of
peace, security and prosperity.

The great majority of South Africans, black and white, support the ideal  of
such a world order. They see it as the only hope and the best guarantor  for
a better life in every respect of the word. They want a world that  will  be
without the current contradictions  that  give  rise  to  poverty,  disease,
oppression and exploitation of groups  and  individuals  by  other  persons.
Wars that still ravage many parts of the globe will be a thing of the past.

The new partnership plan  enjoins  us  to  continue  to  contribute  to  the
processes that must reshape the world. When  the  hon  the  President  raise
these matters on  the  international  stage,  he  does  so  because  of  the
injunctions given to him by our members  and  the  millions  of  people  who
voted overwhelmingly for the ANC in 1994 and in subsequent elections.

We support the President, therefore, when he argues - as he did at the  54th
session of the United Nation's General Assembly - for universal  disarmament
and the destruction of the weapons of war, especially  those  of  a  nuclear
kind that some countries still possess.  We  agree  with  him  that,  as  we
speak, the powerful nations of the world continue to determine  the  pattern
of  international  relations.  We  support  him  when  he  argues  for   the
fundamental restructuring of the international economic plane to  deal  with
underdevelopment.

We are on his side when he argues for a democratisation  of  the  system  of
international governance, among other things  by  restructuring  the  United
Nations itself to create space for all the countries of the globe to  define
the path towards a better world order. He strengthens his argument with  the
fact that the ANC has always stood  for  international  relations  that  are
guided by justice and the rule of law.

All of these questions that redound well to the establishment  of  a  better
world, are part of the make-up of the new partnership  plan.  The  President
has done tremendous work to lobby many influential leaders in the  world  to
support the new programme. Today it enjoys  a  lot  of  support,  especially
among the leading industrialised nations.

We were encouraged by comments from the meeting of  the  steering  committee
of the New Partnership for Africa's  Development  held  recently  in  Abuja.
Their view must be endorsed by all African countries, and they  should  hold
each other accountable for good political and economic governance  if  plans
to  revitalise  the  continent's  economies  are  to  work.  Countries  that
ratified the plan should adhere  to  its  principles  and  proposed  set  of
guidelines.

This sits well with us in South Africa, where important advances  have  been
made to consolidate our democratic order.  As  the  ANC  we  have  used  our
conditions to interact with the various political  leaders  and  parties  on
the continent on the basis of our shared history, so that, together, we  can
reshape both the continent and the world beyond.

In those engagements we speak against the conflicts and wars  that  militate
against development and a better life  for  the  people.  We  speak  against
antidemocratic practices that have encouraged the re-emergence of  ethnicity
and tribalism. We speak against  the  oppression  and  exploitation  of  the
people by the new elites. We argue that an Africa  that  is  free  from  war
will speak with authority on international multilateral forums when  matters
of global conflicts are raised. An Africa of  that  kind  will  be  able  to
argue, for example, for permanent peace in the Middle East on the  basis  of
a viable Palestinian state and an Israeli state within secure borders.

An Africa that revives and consolidates its economies  will  participate  as
an equal partner when international economic  questions  are  discussed.  An
Africa that embraces thoroughgoing democracy will play  a  leading  role  in
the effort to establish the new world order we have spoken about.

The establishment of that order cannot be the  sole  responsibility  of  the
big powers. It cannot be the United States  and  the  countries  of  the  G7
only. It must be the responsibility of the entire  world.  Our  contribution
to this matter, as the ANC, will  include  our  full  participation  in  the
effort to end all wars and conflicts on the African  continent  and  in  the
world. We will fight against terrorism from whatever quarter it emerges.  In
this regard, we reiterate our support to the United States in  its  campaign
against terrorism. Our Government must be supported  by  all  of  us  as  it
makes its contribution in this regard.

But, the new world order that the ANC  talks  about  does  not  include  the
killing   of   innocent   people,   as   is   happening   in    Afghanistan.
[Interjections.] While we understand the anger of the  American  people  and
their leaders in the wake of the  terrorist  attack  on  September  11,  and
condemn the killing of innocent  people  in  that  attack,  we  are  equally
appalled by the killing  of  the  innocent  people  of  Afghanistan  by  the
American troops. No argument  will  convince  us  that  it  is  justifiable,
within the context of  self-defence,  to  kill  women,  children  and  other
vulnerable civilians. [Applause.]

  The  world  order  we  envisage  will  not  accommodate   reprisals   that
detrimentally affect innocent people. We believe that the  establishment  of
the African Union is an indication of the new political will of the  leaders
of Africa. We hope that  the  union  will  encourage  every  leader  on  the
continent to open up political space for all their citizens  to  participate
in the democratisation process. We hope war, conflict,  the  marginalisation
and the dislocation of people and  all  other  anti-human  rights  practices
will end.

We are convinced that the  union  will  be  an  effective  vehicle  to  take
forward the perspective of the new  partnership  plan.  We  are  proud  that
South Africa will host the inaugural summit of the assembly of  the  African
Union, and that our President will possibly be the first leader  to  preside
over the union. [Applause.]

Given that March 2 has been declared by the OAU as union day, we  hope  that
we will be able to celebrate that day next year, together with the  rest  of
the African continent, as Africans, all of who are in  search  of  a  better
future for ourselves.

As the ANC, we acknowledge that while we have travelled quite some  distance
in  South  Africa  in  keeping  with  our  reconstruction  and   development
strategy, so much still needs to be done to consolidate  our  democracy  and
deliver better services to our people.

There is still much in our country that is a throwback to the  old  colonial
and apartheid days of the past. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  OF  PUBLIC  WORKS:  Chairperson,  his  Excellency  the
President, hon colleagues, this debate on a  New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development marks an important milestone in the history of our  country  and
that of our continent.

I feel that, in our participation in this  debate,  we  must  contribute  to
bringing to bear what is required and what it takes  to  transform  a  dream
into reality. I believe that amongst the required ingredients are  optimism,
courage and pragmatism. We must have  the  courage  to  dream  of  a  better
future for the whole of our continent, but also  the  courage  to  recognise
and deal with the many obstacles along the path towards its realisation.  We
have started by moving in the right direction and with the  right  attitude.
For me, the most important ingredient of our future success  is  indeed  the
commencement of the New Partnership for Africa's Development plan which  has
been marked by an optimism, if not an euphoria, never experienced before.

In so doing, we have broken the pernicious cycle of Afro-pessimism. We  have
brought about a fundamental change in  our  attitude  and  overall  cultural
paradigm. We are changing our collective psyche and our  own  perception  of
reality. We have moved from the despair of hopelessness, which has  cast  us
in the mould of victims, into a new attitude which tells us that we can  do,
we can achieve and we can conquer a better future for our posterity.

The passage from passive acceptance of our continental  reality  of  poverty
and under-development to the proactive optimism of being able to  change  it
through our own deeds and will, has ignited a new spirit  which  for  us  is
the most important  ingredient  of  our  success  in  the  making.  We  must
transform this spirit of optimism  into  a  fire  which  ignites  activities
throughout the country and throughout the continent.

A better continent cannot be built only by the action  of  people  operating
at the international level and in the top circles  of  government.  The  New
Partnership for  Africa's  Development  must  change  attitudes  and  infuse
optimism from the ground up and at community level. We must enable  all  our
people to take a hard look at the abject social and economic  conditions  of
their lives and believe that, through their own efforts and those  of  their
communities, things may change and improve.

We must shift the paradigm of despair into believing that tomorrow  will  be
better than today and that the new is better than the old. We  must  believe
in our capacity, to grow by moving from the tested into the  untested,  from
the known into the unknown without fear or hesitation.

Unless there is such a profound change of mindset across the continent,  the
building of a prosperous and stable new  Africa  will  not  be  sufficiently
fuelled by economic development to become a reachable reality.  We  need  to
enable people  to  grow  as  individuals  first  and  then  as  communities,
empowering them with the capacity to rise in dignity  and  to  propel  their
own human growth.

The great dream and the magnificent vision of an African  Renaissance  is  a
possibility if we have the courage to look at the  existing  impediments  to
its full realisation. Our continent suffers from many  old  an  new  wounds,
and yet we must accept that many of them are indeed self-inflicted. We  must
recognise that amongst the causes of poverty are governments  which  do  not
maximise the human and economic potentials of  their  countries  and  become
corrupt.  We  must  accept  that  ineffective,  inadequate  or  undemocratic
governance is one of the causes which has led the  wealthiest  continent  in
the world, in terms of natural resources, to be  the  poorest  in  terms  of
human development, human growth and economic and social development alike.
We must show the world that the New  Partnership  for  Africa's  Development
constitutes a platform which can enable the resolution of Africa's  problems
through the collective effort and action of African leaders. We must  accept
that certain problems must be solved  internationally,  while  others  of  a
more domestic nature  must  receive  the  full  attention  of  each  African
government. We must become rigid in requiring that  the  rule  of  democracy
triumphs and is fully enforced in the organisation  and  operation  of  each
African government. We must demand that  within  each  African  society  the
rule of law becomes the only one governing the people and that, finally  and
forever, the rule of man or woman is abolished in  favour  of  the  rule  of
law.

These are profound changes of attitude which must be brought about within  a
short timeframe if we are to give substance and credence to the  realisation
of our dream. Our dream cannot be realised in  isolation.  It  requires  the
quest for a partnership of development  with  the  rest  of  the  world.  It
requires Africa and the rest of the world to come together on the  basis  of
a common understanding and shared values.

We must strongly put  forward  that  the  world  can  no  longer  afford  or
tolerate the dramatic, social and economic underdevelopment of  the  African
continent. We must seek acceptance for the notion that the world must  share
the responsibility for bringing the development of the African continent  on
par with those of other regions. However, we must do so standing  tall  with
the  dignity  and  righteousness  of  our  dream,  rather  than   presenting
ourselves only as claimants moved by past recriminations and grievances.

We are offering the world a plan for the development of Africa  which  makes
sense, not only for us in Africa, but for the world. We  do  so  because  we
believe that the future lies in our ability to catch up with  globalisation,
and that globalisation demands equitable  development  and  distribution  of
wealth and opportunities. We must demonstrate  our  credibility  in  putting
forward this dream by showing that we have the capacity  to  solve  our  own
problems.

The new partnership for the development of our continent begins at home.  It
begins by imposing the rule of law in  our  communities;  providing  housing
and other essential services to our people; proving that our  continent  and
our Government  works  effectively  and  efficiently,  and  our  ability  to
confront our domestic problems and solve them timeously. We  must  begin  in
our own backyards and lead by example.

We wish to be partners with the rest of the world, but first  and  foremost,
with our sister countries of Africa. We must recognise that, in  approaching
Africa, we as South Africans have as much to learn as we have to teach,  and
that any claim of leadership which we may put forward must be based  on  our
willingness to give and assist, as well as our capacity to  prove  that  our
own standards of government  in  our  efforts  of  development  are  of  the
highest obtainable under our present circumstances. [Applause.]
Dr S E M  PHEKO:  Chairperson  and  the  hon  President,  the  PAC  welcomes
Africa's efforts  being  made  through  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development.

As the  Pan-Africanist  Movement,  the  PAC  has  always  supported  African
efforts which advanced our continent economically and  technologically.  The
only effective way to challenge economic imperialism and recover  possession
of our heritage is for us to act in a Pan-African  manner.  Where  there  is
economic dependence, there can be no freedom and national  dignity.  Efforts
which Africa's leaders are making continentally  are  commendable,  but  are
not new.

One hundred years ago, the vision of a united and liberated  Africa  with  a
common destiny was born. Its guiding political philosophy was coined as Pan-
Africanism by Sylvester Williams, a lawyer of African descent who  practised
law in this country.  Pan-Africanism  was  formalised  in  1900.  Its  major
achievements have been the decolonisation of Africa.
African political scientists, philosophers, scholars,  and  historians  such
as DuBois, C L R  James,  George  Padmore,  Azikiwe,  Marcus  Garvey,  Kwame
Nkrumah, Mangaliso Sobukwe, Patrice Lumumba, Zephania Mothopeng,  and  Gamal
Abdel Nasser developed and embraced Pan-Africanism as an imperative for  the
survival of the African people and for restoring Africa to  her  past  glory
and lost power.

Kwame Nkrumah observed:


  If Africa's multiple resources were used in her development,  they  could
  place Africa among the most  modernised  continents  of  the  world,  but
  Africa's resources are used for the development of overseas countries.

Another giant Pan-Africanist, Mangaliso Robert Sobukwe wrote:


  By  cutting  out  waste  through  systematic  planning,  rapid   economic
  development of Africa can be achieved. The wealth of Africa can begin  to
  work for Africans. There can be no greater  guarantee  against  political
  and economic instability than unequivocal recognition of the supremacy of
  African interests in Africa.

Africans must make up their minds  to  sweat  for  their  own  economic  and
technological development. We must  bear  the  brunt  of  our  own  economic
development in the same way we did for our political liberation.  People  of
goodwill will help us, but we must carry  the  greater  burden  of  our  own
economic liberation. In her struggle for economic  liberation,  Africa  must
maximise the study of modern science and technology in all her  institutions
of learning. This will enable Africa to advance technologically and  process
her own raw materials, instead of exporting and importing them  as  finished
products at inflated prices.

The PAC agrees with President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal, who said:


  If we can move towards equality of  education  and  infrastructure,  then
  Africa could be part of world trade.

Major economic success in  Africa  would  be  brought  about  when  our  own
indigenous businessmen and women are the main players and investors  in  the
economies of Africa.

The PAC supports this courageous Pan-African endeavour. [Applause.]

The PREMIER  OF  THE  NORTHERN  CAPE  (Mr  M  E  Dipico):  Chairperson,  hon
President, hon members, I feel honoured to address this House. In  the  NCOP
we are very few, and when I go to the Northern Cape we are only 30. So,  hon
members will understand if my voice is not the one they are used to.  Please
pardon me for that. [Laughter.] I also have to speak  after  an  hon  member
with a very powerful voice. I do not have that kind of voice.  I  will  have
to train my voice before I come into this House again. [Laughter.]

The debate on the New Partnership for Africa's Development  is  indeed  very
important for the continuing efforts of our country and  other  persons  who
are concerned about the development of our continent and its  people.  There
is no doubt in my mind that  efforts  to  bring  about  development  in  our
provinces are integrally  linked  to  the  overall  strategic  objective  of
realising Africa's potential.

In this context, those of us who have sought to develop ties and links  with
the developed world  should  also  endeavour  to  develop  similar,  if  not
stronger, ties in many aspects of our work with  those  countries  bordering
us. Therefore, provinces bordering a number of countries have been  involved
in a number of developments. There have been continuing bilaterals,  people-
to-people relationships, sharing relationships and ties  around  issues  and
fields  of  administration,  governance,  economic  development  and   other
mutually beneficial areas.

It is also worth noting the work  we  do  with  the  Transfrontier  National
Parks, which really break down the borders and  link  our  economies  in  an
integral  way.  Indeed,  we  see  progress.  We  see  our  people  and   our
governments coming nearer to all our people.

As we debate this topic the President has put in front of  us,  there  would
seem to be people who speak about doom and gloom when they  talk  about  our
continent. But the following is also true for Africa. According to  Africa's
Human Development Report, there have been achievements we have to note,  and
they must not elude us.

The report says that between 1960 and 1993 life  expectancy  increased  from
40 years to 51 years. In the past decade the proportion  of  the  population
with access to safe water nearly doubled from 25% to 43%.  During  the  past
two decades, adult literacy more than doubled from 27% to 55%. Between  1960
and 1991, the net enrolment ratio at the primary level  increased  from  25%
to 50%; and at the secondary level from 13% to 38%. Over the period 1980  to
1992, five counties, that is Botswana, Cape Verde,  Lesotho,  Mauritius  and
Swaziland, had an annual GDP growth rate of more than 5%.

This is progress. And, indeed, when we talk about these  matters  we  should
be able to say, ``There is progress,  and  all  is  not  doom  and  gloom''.
Indeed, a very difficult issue we have been dealing with in Africa  is  that
of women representation in parliament. We have  seen  progress  since  South
Africa has taken the lead in pursuing this,  as  our  Speaker  has  been  in
delegations visiting our countries on  the  continent.  We  have  seen  some
progress locally in that the number of  women  in  our  parliaments  in  our
country is actually increasing. I think this is what we have  to  encourage.
That representation  also  outstrips  some  countries  in  South  Asia  and,
indeed, it is something to reckon with.

Over the past three decades the infant mortality rate dropped from  167  per
1 000 live births to 97. Our country and people also have  a  responsibility
to make it their business to comprehend the continent and its dynamics.  The
rich culture and history of our  continent  are,  indeed,  great  treasures,
which our future generations can take pride in.

The landscapes of Africa tell a story, which must be told and  enriched.  By
building partnerships and strengthening  people-to-people  relations,  which
seek to develop the human potential of our  peoples,  we  will  realise  the
goal of Africa's revival. We will instil pride in and a sense of  commitment
to the goals of the Renaissance and  ensure  that  Africa  takes  its  place
among the nations  of  the  world.  We  must  foster  strong  relations  and
solidarity between and among ourselves as Africans in order to give  meaning
to the relations we seek with the developed world.

The provinces are thankful to the hon President. His team held a  road  show
in all the provinces to take us through what  he  has  been  engaged  in  in
Africa, the partnerships he has been building, and his  work  in  convincing
the developed world to assist and be part of this very good vision.
We were briefed as the executive, as members of the legislatures,  as  heads
of departments in a number of departments, as  NGOs  and  as  civil  society
that this was the way to ensure that one takes the  people  of  the  country
along. We are thankful to the President that he does  not  move  alone,  but
has been briefing us. I want to put it on record that this is not the  first
time we are dealing with this matter. Provinces  have  advanced  -  we  have
been dealing with this matter. We have been looking at the contributions  we
are making.

Lastly, I want to wish for  the  President  to  continue,  noting  that  the
people support him, and that the ordinary people  are  still  pinning  their
hopes on him to turn the continent around, to ensure that it is  prosperous,
united and successful. [Applause.]

Dr  A  I  VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  hon  President,  I  would   like   to
congratulate the President on his stance on Africa,  and  say  that  the  FA
supports these initiatives. I was reminded  some  time  ago  by  Mr  Wallace
Ngoqi, the Chief Land Claims Commissioner, of a  quote  by  Patrice  Lumumba
who said:


     Africa will write her own history. It will be a glorious and  dignified
     history.

I think that it is important that we take note of that - that we will  write
it ourselves and that Africa will determine its own success and failure.

The key to success is that Africa must stimulate  and  release  the  talents
and ability of its people to  develop  the  necessary  skills,  to  use  the
resources, to uplift our people and to counter the poverty problem  that  we
have. I would like to concentrate, in the short  time,  on  one  aspect  and
that is the land reform problems in South Africa.

 Land reform for the sake of political motives and  statistics  and  without
the necessary results and sustainable economic production of food and  fibre
will create  a  serious  problem.  Sustainable  land  reform  is  of  utmost
importance for us all. Land  reform  for  the  sole  purpose  of  resettling
people in the rural areas will be a disaster. Land reform which will  result
in  sustainable  production  and  a  better  livelihood  for  new  entrants,
especially to agriculture, is a key to success.

It is well known that  the  present  land  reform  process  in  neighbouring
states has gone terribly wrong. Instead  of  stimulating  the  economy,  the
wrong application of land reform for  political  convenience  is  destroying
the economy of one country and, with it, the better life all so  desperately
want. The negative economic result is spilling over to South Africa  and  to
the region and is threatening our own development.

I foresee the same problem in South Africa, if the present  policy  of  land
reform, although with noble intentions  and  plans,  continues  to  resettle
people in our  country  on  two  small  areas,  and  without  the  necessary
accompanying expertise to develop sustainable production in  agriculture.  I
think we must take note of that.  Likewise,  elsewhere  in  this  continent,
this reform did not succeed.

One of the most important contributions that South Africa can  make  to  the
renaissance of Africa is to show Africa how the people  in  Southern  Africa
can successfully solve the problem of land  reform.  It  can  be  done.  The
President's action to mobilise and encourage  the  available  competent  and
willing  people  within  the  agricultural  fraternity  to  mobilise   their
experience and ability to participate in sustainable land reform  programmes
is the right step. It is well received.

However, bureaucracy and struggle-thinking  in  the  Public  Service  is  an
important inhibiting factor  which  discourages  enthusiastic  participation
and even prevents progress on this front. The President's serious  attention
on this matter is of utmost importance for South  Africa  and,  indeed,  for
Africa. [Applause.]

Ms B THOMPSON: Chairperson, hon President and hon members ...

Ilungu  elihloniphekile  u-Van  Schalkwyk  uthi  akayiboni  kahle  le  ndaba
yokuthi into ibe ntukuntuku. Into kufanele ibe ngokukodwa  phakathi  kokuthi
iyashisa noma iyabanda. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[Mr Van Schalkwyk says he does not agree with the fact that a  thing  should
be lukewarm. A thing should be either hot or cold.]

There is indeed little doubt that our continent is at a  critical  crossroad
in its history. It is  on  its  road  to  making  this  century  an  African
century. It is at a juncture where the vision of an African  Renaissance  is
no longer just a vision, but a reality. To quote our  President:  Those  who
have eyes, let them see the African Renaissance has just begun.

The New Partnership for Africa's Development is therefore a  pragmatic  tool
that will turn this vision into reality. It is a  programme  of  action  for
the economic and social revival of Africa based on constructive  partnership
between Africa and the north. Based on shared interests, these  partnerships
have the potential to develop  infrastructure,  agri-industry,  tourism  and
human resources and also promote urban renewal and rural development. It  is
thus a pledge by African leaders to eradicate poverty and reposition  Africa
on the path of sustainable growth and development.

Decades  of  colonial  oppression  and  exploitation  have  led  to  endemic
famines, poverty, deteriorating health conditions, lack of  access  to  safe
drinking  water,  sanitation,   health   and   educational   services.   The
accumulating effect has thrown  billions  of  African  people  into  vicious
circles of economic and social deprivation. If  one  looks  at  the  current
picture of Africa, as it emerges from particularly the  Western  media,  one
gets the impression that our continent is beyond redemption.

The  image  that  is  portrayed  of  our  continent  is  one  of   political
instability, civil  strife  and  armed  conflicts.  It  is  an  image  of  a
continent in the grip of seemingly  unremitting  economic  and  humanitarian
crises. These images of Africa have led many to view the  African  situation
with great despair and scepticism, and of course, they are not true.

While we do not dispute the enormous difficulties faced  by  our  continent,
there is really no need to take an unduly pessimistic view  of  the  present
situation. Quoting our hon President:


  Africa of today is an Africa  of  hope,  a  continent  that  resumed  its
  journey out of a period of despair. It is a  time  for  the  rebirth  and
  revival of Africa and the African Renaissance.

Therefore, the New Partnership for  Africa's  Development  is  a  move  from
conceptualising the vision of an African Renaissance to operationalising  it
to indeed make this century an African century and to achieve  the  ultimate
goal of African unity and prosperity. This partnership signals  that  Africa
can no longer isolate itself from the globalisation process, and  must  work
to harness the  positive  aspect  of  this  process  to  meet  developmental
objectives. It calls for international solidarity, but  emphasises  that  it
is up to us as Africans to take our continent forward to a better future.

Consequently,  the  programme  outlines  the  vision  of  an  Africa   which
resolutely gets to grips with overcoming its  problems:  a  continent  which
aims to set the priorities and focal points  for  the  future;  a  continent
which neither wants to be exploited nor to be an international  receiver  of
alms, but wants to develop into an attractive  trade  partner  and  location
for investment, and a region which, as a recognised  partner  in  the  world
community, is able to make its contribution to solving global issues of  the
future.

Without any doubt, Africa is blessed with a  rich  landscape  and  countless
resources and yet, because of our past,  the  majority  of  our  people,  in
particular the ones who reside in the rural areas, are poor.  For  instance,
South Africa has a dual agricultural  economy  comprising  a  well-developed
commercial sector as well as a predominantly  subsistence-orientated  sector
in the rural areas.

The previous regime did not empower people in these areas, and  neither  did
they create a good infrastructure for development in  the  rural  areas,  in
particular, in the agricultural sector. It did not empower people to  embark
on  development  initiatives  to  realise  their  potential  to  invest   in
themselves economically  and  otherwise.  This  led  to  a  decline  of  our
people's  participation  in  agriculture,  resulting  in  insufficient  food
production and eventually poverty and hunger.

Urbanisation also became a problem, as people, because  of  poverty  in  the
rural sectors, would go and look for greener  pastures  in  the  towns  and,
ironically, they would be  faced  with  joblessness,  no  accommodation  and
further poverty, and  some  would  resort  to  other  alternative  means  of
survival. As we revive our economies, one of the key challenges,  therefore,
is to reprioritise agriculture as a critical and strategic  element  of  the
attainment of growth and economic development.

Investing in agriculture is, indeed, a key to empowering the people  in  the
rural  sector,  which  in  Africa  comprises  the  greater  portion  of  the
population. It is a key to boosting  our  own  economy.  Investing  in  this
sector also implies food  promotion,  own  food  production,  generation  of
income through commercialisation and job creation. The New  Partnership  for

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, hon President, hon  members,  Africa  is  a
continent noticed many years ago for its affluent content  in  minerals  and
so many  other  attributes  that  made  us  fall  victim  to  the  claws  of
colonialism, and then to bad governance. Though sapped of  so  much,  Africa
continues to be a rich continent with potential that we,  through  a  united
effort with countries throughout this  continent,  should  utilise  for  the
advancement of Africa.

It is true that within South Africa lies a citizenry so rich  in  diversity,
yet united in all efforts for the betterment and advancement of  its  state.
It is also true that we, as South Africans, might be different  in  so  many
ways from our neighbours on the same continent, but we too can unite  in  an
effort to advance Africa as a whole for the betterment of all.

Global competition places us at  a  minimal  competitive  existence,  but  a
united effort by all constituencies in  Africa  would  certainly  boost  our
position, power and potential in the continent. It is indeed an  honour  and
a privilege to experience all  these  nations  making  a  united  effort  to
embark on the upliftment of Africa, both domestically and internationally.

 It is clear that the partnership undertakings are of great  importance  and
value to all. Matters  addressed  and  focused  upon  are  central  to  this
advancement and hopefully will be activated  to  its  best  abilities,  both
thoroughly and efficiently.

Let us look upon poverty, mortality, and  their  likes,  and  see  a  crying
nation, which we as  Government  serve  to  correct.  Let  us  look  at  our
undermined abilities to compete in the global market  and  remind  ourselves
that we are the competitors to take charge. Let us remind ourselves  of  our
nation raped of its wealth and people forced into the most abhorrent  living
conditions, and let us remind ourselves that we have the ability to  correct
those losses and avoid a repetition of that disaster. I quote:


  We will no longer allow ourselves to be conditioned by  circumstance.  We
  will determine our own destiny and call on  the  rest  of  the  world  to
  complement our efforts.

This is the stand of a united Africa, and this is the stand of  the  MF.  We
unite in all efforts to attain this progress. We see  the  poverty,  we  see
the underdevelopment, we see the competitive markets, we see the  need,  and
we see the ability and potential of a united  front  by  nations  throughout
Africa attaining this. But we all know  that  it  takes  more  than  belief,
trust and hope to achieve ends. God helps those  who  help  themselves.  So,
may tools and mechanisms be put into motion to attain our end,  which  is  a
better Africa. The MF congratulates the President on his initiative.

Mev E C GOUWS: Mevrou die Speaker, ek  praat  vandag  as  'n  Afrikaner  wat
verbonde is aan Afrika, wie se toekoms hier lê,  wie  se  nageslag  nog  vir
eeue in dié land gaan leef.

As ek sê dat ons hier is en hier leef, sê ek veel meer. Ons is nie net  hier
en leef nie net hier nie, ons werk ook hier en ons lewer hier ook 'n  bydrae
tot die ontwikkeling en vooruitgang van Suid-Afrika. Só was dit  en  só  sal
dit altyd wees.

Ek sê vandag onomwonde dat  as  die  gedagte  van  'n  Afrika-ontwaking  wil
slaag, moet die bydraes van ons mense nie weggewys word  nie.  Elke  druppel
kundigheid, elke ons energie en werkvermoë en elke stukkie  vaderlandsliefde
wat daar te vind is, sal gemobiliseer moet word.

'n Afrika-ontwaking in die volle sin van die woord moet deur  Afrikane  self
geskep word. Ander kan nie vir ons brûe bou  nie,  hulle  kan  nie  vir  ons
besproeiingskemas aanlê nie, hulle kan nie produktiewe plase  aanlê  nie  en
ander kan nie vir ons of namens ons gedigte skryf en sing en komponeer nie.

Nee, as ons wil ontwaak, moet ons dit self vermag. Dit het  tyd  geword  dat
ons ophou kla oor veronregting en mishandeling. Nee, ons moet  nou  aan  die
wêreld wys dat ons self die pad van  vrede  en  vooruitgang  kan  uitbeitel.
Afrika moet wys dat hy hom  uit  die  kloue  van  geweld,  oorlog,  armoede,
verwoesting en vernietiging kan ontworstel.

Ek ken ook my mense. Dit is nie net die  uitsluitlike  voorreg  van  sommige
politieke partye se leierskap om namens die mense  op  die  grond  te  praat
nie. Ons mense kan vir hulself dink en besluite neem. Hulle is  baie  lojaal
aan Suid-Afrika. Dit is nie net noodwendig 'n lid van die agb  President  se
politieke party of een van sy koalisie-maats wat 'n bydrae  kan  lewer  nie,
maar dan moet ons wat  in  die  opposisiebanke  sit,  ook  na  daardie  nuwe
daeraad vir Afrika gelei word en nie as onpatrioties afgemaak word nie.

Daardie daeraad sal aanbreek as Afrika nie net polities  vry  is  nie,  maar
inderdaad ook vry is van die kettings van die duisternis. Ons, al die  mense
van Suid-Afrika, is gereed om ons deel te doen om Afrika na 'n nuwe  daeraad
te lei. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mrs E C GOUWS: Madam Speaker, today I am speaking as an  Afrikaner  who  is
bound to Africa, whose future is here, whose descendants are still going  to
live in this country for centuries.

When I say that we are here, and that we live here, I am  saying  much  more
than that. We are not just here, and just live here. We also work  here  and
make a contribution to the development and progress of  South  Africa.  This
is how it was and how it always will be.

I want to say frankly today that if the idea of an  African  renaissance  is
to succeed, the contributions of our people should not  be  declined.  Every
drop of expertise, every ounce of energy and working  capability  and  every
drop of love for the fatherland  that  is  to  be  found  will  have  to  be
mobilised.

An African renaissance awakening in the full  sense  of  the  word  must  be
created by Africans themselves. Others cannot build  bridges  for  us,  they
cannot install irrigation schemes  for  us,  they  cannot  build  productive
farms and they cannot write poetry or sing or compose for or  on  behalf  of
us.

No, if we want to awaken, we have to do it ourselves. The time has come  for
us to stop complaining about injustice and abuse. No, now we must  show  the
world that we ourselves can carve out the  road  of  peace  and  prosperity.
Africa must show that it can  shake  off  the  shackles  of  violence,  war,
poverty, devastation and destruction.

I also know my people. It is not the exclusive privilege of  the  leadership
of some political parties to talk on behalf of  the  people  at  grass-roots
level. Our people can think for themselves  and  make  decisions.  They  are
very loyal to South Africa. It is not necessarily only a member of  the  hon
President's political party or one of his coalition friends who can  make  a
contribution, but then we who sit in the opposition  benches  must  also  be
led towards that new dawn for Africa  and  not  be  shrugged  off  as  being
unpatriotic.

That dawn will break when Africa is not only politically  free,  but  indeed
also free of the chains of darkness. We, all the  people  of  South  Africa,
are  ready  to  do  our  share  in  leading  Africa  towards  a  new   dawn.
[Applause.]]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, Mr President, I stand here before this House  as
a child of Africa. My origin  is  Europe,  but  my  destination  is  Africa.
[Interjections.] My five children are all adults, and all of them still  are
in Africa and plan to stay here with their  lovely  children.  Their  future
and their prosperity is unconditionally linked to the prosperity of  Africa,
more specifically, South Africa.

It is, of course, an Africa that has changed dramatically  during  the  past
decades. The crux of this change is that Africa now  holds  its  destiny  in
its own hands, it is not in the hands of an external power.  This  places  a
huge responsibility on the shoulders of the countries, the leaders  and  the
peoples of Africa. It is within this context that the President started  his
address today with the vital question: Can Africa claim  the  21st  century?
Can we, as masters of our  own  destiny,  make  it  a  safe  and  prosperous
destiny? The answer: There is no alternative.

I speak on behalf of many more Afrikaners - and the 50  000  who  voted  for
the AEB - when I say that we want  to  be  part  of  the  success  of  South
Africa, not its failure. We want to take our place not on  the  pavilion  of
Africa, but on the playing field.

Kyk ons na die geskiedenis van die Afrikaner in  Suid-Afrika  sien  ons  hom
waar hy, met foute en al, telkens 'n beslissende verskil gemaak het.  Nêrens
vind ons hom op die paviljoen nie. Ons sien hom op die  veld  in  die  hitte
van die stryd. Dit is waar ons wil wees. Ons wil ons bydrae  maak.  Ons  wil
ons rol speel. Ons wil nie net krampagtig ons eie bevorder  nie.  Ons  weet,
ons het ook 'n verantwoordelikheid  in  die  bekamping  van  armoede,  vigs,
werkloosheid en die verskaffing van behuising vir alle mense.  Ons  wil  dit
nie doen omdat ons stemme  soek  nie.  Ons  wil  dit  doen,  omdat  dit  ons
Christelike roeping is en ons weet ons lot is verbonde met dié  van  al  die
mense in hierdie land.

Maar dan vra ons ook: Laat ons toe om onsself te wees. Alleen  dan  kan  ons
ons bydrae maak. Ons kan nie in geleende klere  vir  Suid-Afrika  en  Afrika
iets beteken nie. Ons kan dit nie doen in 'n ander man se taal nie. Ons  wil
nie bloot as individue onmisbaar wees nie, maar as 'n gemeenskap  binne  die
geborgenheid van ons eie. Ons wil dit  doen  in  'n  idioom  en  'n  kultuur
waarbinne ons onsself tuis vind. Ons wil dit doen sonder die verloëning  van
die bloed wat deur ons  are  vloei.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[When we look at the history of the Afrikaner in South Africa we  see  where
he, with faults and all has again and  again  made  a  definite  difference.
Nowhere do we find him on the pavilion. We see him on the field in the  heat
of the struggle. That  is  where  we  want  to  be.  We  want  to  make  our
contribution. We want to play our  role.  We  do  not  desperately  want  to
promote only our own. We know that we also  have  a  responsibility  in  the
combating of poverty, Aids, unemployment and in providing  housing  for  all
people. We do not want to do this because we are looking for votes. We  want
to do this because it is our Christian calling and we know that our  destiny
is bound with that of all the people of this country.

But then we also ask: Allow us to be ourselves. Only then can we  also  make
our contribution. We cannot mean something to South  Africa  and  Africa  in
borrowed garb. We cannot do this  in  another  man's  language.  We  do  not
merely want to be indispensable as individuals, but as  a  community  within
the safety of our own. We want to do this in  an  idiom  and  a  culture  in
which we ourselves feel at home. We want to do this without  the  denial  of
the blood which courses through our veins.]

We are not awaiting the day when Afrikaners can rise again  like  a  phoenix
from the ashes of Africa because we know that  we  will  be  part  of  those
ashes. Therefore, we support any plan to make  South  Africa  and  Africa  a
better place for all its people. The AEB supports the  New  Partnership  for
Africa's Development, and we want to be part of it in  our  own  unique  and
indispensable way. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, Chairperson of the  NCOP,  Mr
President and hon members, Bernard Makhosezwe Magubane says  that  the  idea
of an African Renaissance has evoked not only a sense of hope,  but  also  a
great deal of wilful misunderstanding, cynicism and skepticism, as a  result
of which almost every setback is said to make a  farce  of  our  President's
call for such a renaissance.

This cynicism and the resilience of the stereotyping of Africans and  Africa
as inferior and lacking in rationality, is exposed by  Judith  Registre  and
Wonderboy Peters who, reporting on the 1998  World  Cup  finals  in  France,
said, and I quote:


  The ultimate failure of African teams was  received  within  the  general
  perception of Africa's failure as a continent. On  July  6,  the  SABC  1
  weekly programme Panasonic World of Soccer focused on  the  link  between
  the failure of these teams and the question of the  African  Renaissance.
  As each loss  was  replayed  in  slow  motion,  the  caption  which  read
  ``African Renaissance'',  kept  flashing.  This  programme  seems  to  be
  ridiculing the ideal of the African Renaissance by  juxtaposing  it  with
  Africa's performance in the World Cup. If Africa's hopes at the World Cup
  had been  punctured,  then  the  African  Renaissance,  the  ideal  which
  promises to craft new realities for Africa and its citizens, was seen  as
  destined to fail.

Indeed, when things go wrong in the Democratic  Republic  of  Congo  and  as
conflict and war continue to manifest themselves in  parts  of  the  African
continent, regardless of progress that is  being  made  every  day  in  many
countries on the continent towards peace, stability, democracy and  economic
development, such setbacks are projected in bold across the screens  of  the
world as stark examples that Africa is a doomed continent.

In his paper titled The African Renaissance in  Historical  Perspective,  Mr
Magubane  correctly  points  out  that  before   the   renaissance,   Europe
experienced a period of great instability  and  social  turmoil  that  makes
Africa's troubles seem mild in comparison. From natural  disasters  such  as
the eruptions of Mount Vesuvius and Mount  Etna,  a  violent  earthquake  in
England in the midst of a famine, to the crisis of the feudal era  that  saw
many countries fall into a chronic state  of  anarchy,  kept  alive  by  the
barons of war, typified  by  the  Hundred  Years  War  between  England  and
France, and the civil turmoil that rocked Germany and central Europe.

Of this period - and in particular the Great  Plague,  the  Black  Death  of
1348 to 1350 - Barbara Tuchman wrote,and I quote:


  To the people at large, there could only be one explanation -  the  wrath
  of God. What sins were on the 14th century conscience?  Primarily  greed,
  the sin of avarice, followed by usury, worldliness, adultery,  blasphemy,
  falsehoods, luxury and irreligion. The result was an underground lake  of
  guilt in the soul that the plague now tapped.


  Survivors  of  the  plague,  finding  themselves  neither  destroyed  nor
  improved, could discover no Divine purpose in the pain they had suffered.
  God's purposes were usually mysterious, but this  scourge  had  been  too
  terrible to be accepted  without  questioning.  If  a  disaster  of  such
  magnitude, the most lethal ever known, was a mere wanton act  of  God  or
  perhaps not God's work at all, then the absolutes of a fixed  order  were
  loosed from their moorings. Minds that opened to  admit  these  questions
  could never again be shut ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. To that extent, the Black Death may have
  been the unrecognised beginning of modern man.

The relevance of this snapshot of pre-Renaissance Europe, through  the  work
of Mr Magubane, is that he then posits a view that to  understand  the  idea
of the African Renaissance we must take stock of the  crisis  to  which  the
European Renaissance was an answer. I ask whether instead  of  the  cynicism
and skepticism, of  which  we  have  seen  much,  the  African  Renaissance,
underpinned by the New Partnership for Africa's Development  and  the  birth
of the African Union, should not rather be seen as an idea  whose  time  has
come and is representative of a  historical  juncture  in  which  Africa  is
seeking answers  to  the  host  of  problems  facing  her.  Indeed,  Patrick
O'Farrell says:


  Crises  of  any  magnitude  are  usually  the   culminating   points   of
  degenerative historical developments.
Europe has come a long way since the time of the Renaissance  and  today  we
speak of the highly developed European Union, which has evolved over a  long
period through determined efforts and programmes to  lift  it  out  of  that
era, and subsequent setbacks  such  as  the  two  world  wars  of  the  20th
century, the period of colonial plunder notwithstanding.

The critical challenge for us in Africa is that we do not  have  the  luxury
of time. The continent is characterised by frightening  levels  of  poverty,
flight of capital, unsustainable levels of debt and the  flight  of  skills.
What confronts Africa is to identify what needs to be done and  it  is  this
that the new partnership seeks to answer. In  that  regard  it  communicates
two essential messages, namely that  Africans  themselves  must  create  the
conditions for development and that there are concrete steps  that  we  must
take and things we must do, not because they are  anyone's  imposition,  but
because they are in our own interest.

Secondly, as we do so we shall need partnerships, both within countries,  as
we shall need to mobilise all sectors of society,  and  with  the  developed
world, as we shall need to mobilise additional  resources  to  overcome  the
resource constraints which are part of current realities. Let  us  now  turn
to these things that must be done, and chief among these  are  coherent  and
comprehensive strategies for macroeconomic stabilisation of our economies.

Our own experience tells us that there are  real  benefits  to  be  realised
from pursuing such a strategy, as we today live and work in  an  environment
of stable price levels as inflation has been brought under control. What  we
must never lose sight of is the fact that it is the  poor  who  benefit  the
most from a low-inflation environment, as it protects the  buying  of  their
meagre incomes. We also  live  and  work  in  an  environment  of  declining
interest rates, which contributes to both lower  levels  of  household  debt
and creates conditions for higher levels of investment.

An important  part  of  the  macroeconomic  stabilisation  equation  is  the
management of the levels of debt and costs of servicing  such  debt.  Again,
our own experience is that success in this  regard  results  in  release  of
resources for important socioeconomic programmes.  What  these  examples  of
concrete achievements must say to us, and to all on the continent,  is  that
these things are possible. Let us go out there and do them.

The Minister of Finance said very boldly that from our experience,  we  have
come to recognise  that  most,  if  not  all  the  levels  of  macroeconomic
stabilisation, are in the hands of Government and that it is in the area  of
microeconomic reform that we need partnerships  with  business  and  labour.
Having said that, I have to make the point that for most  African  countries
the area of debt management will be the most difficult, as many are  trapped
in unsustainable levels of debt.

This must be an occasion, therefore, on  which  we  call  on  the  developed
world and  multilateral  organisations  and  institutions  to  expedite  the
processes that will yield deeper and faster debt relief.  Equally,  we  must
call on and challenge the beneficiaries of such programmes  to  ensure  that
the resources thus released should be utilised in the efforts  to  eradicate
poverty.

In this regard, we clearly have to go beyond macroeconomic stabilisation  to
improve  revenue  collection,  ensure  allocations  of  budgetary  resources
according  to  policy  priorities,  enhance  the  capacity  to  spend   such
resources  effectively  and   efficiently   and   improve   public   finance
management. Again, our own experience is instructive.  The  new  partnership
also seeks to reverse the outflow of private capital  as  well  as  increase
the inflow of development assistance resources.

As other speakers have shown, there is much more that needs to be done.  The
question is whether all of this is possible. In  other  words,  will  Africa
make it through this challenging task? To answer this question  we  have  to
take courage from the words of Pixley ka Isaka Seme who said,  at  the  turn
of the last century:


  Come with me to the ancient capital of Egypt, Thebes,  the  city  of  one
  hundred gates. The grandeur of  its  venerable  ruins  and  the  gigantic
  proportions of its architecture reduces  to  insignificance  the  boasted
  monuments of other nations. The pyramids of Egypt are structures to which
  the world presents nothing comparable. The mighty monuments seem to  look
  with disdain on every other work of human art  and  to  vie  with  nature
  herself. All of the glory of Egypt belongs  to  Africa  and  her  people.
  These monuments are the  indestructible  memorials  of  their  great  and
  original genius.

I would like to tell the hon President that in articulating the dream of  an
African Renaissance and being in the forefront of  the  development  of  the
new partnership, he is realising the vision of the founding fathers  of  the
African National Congress, the first national  liberation  movement  on  the
African continent. This movement will stand with and behind him  every  step
of the way. The ANC lives, the ANC leads. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF  EDUCATION:  Madam  Speaker,  Mr  President  and  hon
members, this Millennium African Recovery Plan is one of the  most  positive
notions to come out of our continent in a long while.  Coming  as  it  does,
almost at the same time as the conversion of  the  Organisation  of  African
Unity into an African Union that will put greater emphasis on  the  economic
integration of Africa, this recovery plan is timely indeed. It will  provide
content and substance to the African Union.

An important and crucial feature of this plan is its  bold  and  unambiguous
assertion that the economic recovery and progress of Africa is  the  primary
responsibility of the Africans themselves.  Assistance  from  others  should
compliment our own efforts.

For far too long, Africans have  thoroughly  undermined  and  underestimated
their own ability to alter their circumstances. We rightly blamed our  slave
and colonial masters for  our  poverty  and  underdevelopment,  but  somehow
seemed to look entirely in their direction  for  our  salvation.  A  greater
reliance on ourselves will do us a world of good.

In Africa, we did mobilise one another and  fought  for  political  freedom,
but once that was achieved we tended to demobilise the  masses  and  settled
down to worship our new flags, national anthems and our leaders. Of  course,
that is in order, provided we are aware that these  are  only  symbols.  The
content of our freedom must be ownership of our  economies  and  respectable
standards of living for all our people.

This Millennium African Recovery Plan challenges this and  seeks  to  change
our mindset and circumstances. But, the challenge that faces all  of  us  is
to  popularise  the  plan  among  the  vast  majority  of  our  people.  The
conception and articulation of the recovery plan have been done  with  grit,
brilliance and courage. But,  for  its  success  it  needs  to  capture  the
imagination of the African people and to harness their genius and energies.

In order to succeed on a continental level, it must first  be  relevant  and
successful at the village and township level, where we  live.  For  that  to
happen, we need to mobilise as hard as we did in the struggle for  political
freedom. After all, the essence of  that  liberation  struggle  is  economic
ownership, control and social progress. Without  these,  it  is  hollow.  We
wholeheartedly support and embrace this partnership. [Applause.]

Nkskz C I GCINA:  Mhlali-ngaphambili,  Mongameli  ohloniphekileyo  namalungu
onke akule Ndlu, ndinovuyo nochulumanco ukufumana le ndima  yokuphosa  igade
kule ngxoxo namhlanje.

Lo  mbono  mtsha  wokuhlaziya  nokuphucula   iAfrika   linyathelo   elikhulu
nelibaluleke, ngokumandla, ekubuyiseni isidima kubantu base-Afrika.  Isidima
sabantu base-Afrika  sehla  mhla  kwahluthwa  imihlaba  nobutyebi  ezandleni
zabemi  beli,  namhla  abantwana  bomthonyama  banyanzeliswa  ukuba  bamkele
amasiko nezithethe zezinye iintlanga, benziwa  ukuba  bazidele,  babusengele
phantsi ubuntu babo.

Kakade, apha eAfrika isisithethe  esidala  nesinezimvi  into  yokuba  onento
aphe olambileyo, ofuyileyo anqomele ongafuyanga,  de  kuthiwe  xa  kuthethwa
`nongafuyanga uyayitya inyama'.  Le  mbono  yokumanya  nokudibanisa  iAfrika
ukuze  isebenze  kunye,  ithethe  ngazwi  linye,  ihambe  ngesingqi   esinye
kwindlela eya kwiAfrika ehluthayo, yimbono  efuna  inkxaso  epheleleyo  kubo
bonke abantu beli lizwe.  Linyathelo  elijoliswe  ekubeni  kuphele  indlala,
ubuhlwempu  nentswelo  ebangelwe   yiminyaka   yengcinezelo   nokuxhatshazwa
kwabantu beli lizwekazi lakowethu iAfrika.

IAfrika iza kuyeka ngoku ukuba lithanga lamanye amazwe, ibonakale  izimisele
ukuphakama ze ihlangabezane  nemingeni  ejongene  nayo.  IAfrika  inoompondo
zihlanjiwe beenkokeli ngoku, ezizimisele ukwenza konke  okusemandleni  ukuze
kuphakame umgangatho wokuphila eAfrika.

Phakathi kwaba mpondo zihlanjiwe eli lizwe lisikelelwe ngokuba  nooxholovane
beenkokeli. Lo mfo kaMbeki ukwazile ukuthabatha izithethe  ezidala  namasiko
eANC awatolike ze awangqamanise neemfuno, nemingeni yeli  xesha.  UMongameli
uMbeki uhamba kanye  emkhondweni  wembali  etyebileyo  ye-ANC,  yona  yathi,
kwasekusekweni kwayo, yalubona unxulumano phakathi kwenkululeko  yethu  apha
eMzantsi  Afrika  nenkululeko  yeAfrika  iphela,  nethe,  njengowona  mbutho
umdala  ukulwela  inkululeko  eAfrika,  yanegalelo  elikhulu   kwimizabalazo
yokukhulula  iAfrika,  Afrika,  leyo,  ethe  yasibuyekeza  ngokuba   nenceba
ngakuthi nenkxaso enkulu ngexesha ekwakunzima ngalo, de sakhululeka.

Indima edlalwe nguMongameli  uMbeki  kulo  mbono  yimbuyekezo  efanelekileyo
kubantu baseAfrika ngenkxaso abasinika yona  ngexesha  esasizabalaza  ngalo.
Yimbuyekezo kubantu beli lizwe loMzantsi Afrika kuba iza nentlutha,  intlalo
entle, imisebenzi,  impilo  entle,  ubudlelwane  kunye  nomanyano  loMzantsi
Afrika namazwe elizwekazi le Afrika.

Onke amaqhawe omzabalazo  eli  lizwe  nezwekazi  le-Afrika,  iinto  zooDube,
Kwame  Nkrumah,  ooSontonga,  ooMqhayi,  uChief  Albert  Luthuli,  Khayingo,

[Mrs C I GCINA: Chairperson, hon President and hon members  of  this  august
House, it is a great honour for me to make an input in today's debate.

This new vision of reviving and developing  Africa  is  a  very  significant
step, especially with regard to restoring  the  dignity  of  the  people  of
Africa. The devaluation of the dignity of the  people  of  Africa  crept  in
when they were robbed of their  land  with  all  its  wealth  and  when  the
children of the soil were forced to embrace the culture  of  foreigners,  to
doubt their worth and to look down upon their own identity.

It is an age-old principle in Africa that those who have support  those  who
do not have, even if that means having to give some  of  your  livestock  to
someone who does not have any. Hence the expression: one does  not  have  to
own any livestock to be able to eat  meat.  This  idea  of  bringing  Africa
together and uniting it, so that it can speak with one voice and  move  with
synchronised steps on its way to being  a  self-sufficient  Africa,  is  one
that deserves unflinching support from all the people of  this  country.  It
is an idea that is aimed at the alleviation of  poverty  that  has  resulted
from countless years of oppression and exploitation of  the  people  of  our
continent, Africa.

Africa shall now cease to be a colony of other countries and shall  be  seen
to be determined to stand up and confront the  challenges  that  are  facing
it. Africa is now blessed with high-calibre leaders who  are  determined  to
do everything in their power to ensure that the quality of  life  in  Africa
is improved. Among these high-calibre leaders this country is  blessed  with
ones that really stand out. Hon President Mbeki has been able  to  take  the
traditional norms and principles of the ANC and reinterpret them  and  align
them to the needs and challenges of this era. In doing this,  hon  President
Mbeki is following the trail of the rich history of the  ANC,  which,  right
from its inception, recognised the link between our freedom in South  Africa
and that of the entire  continent  of  Africa,  and  which,  as  the  oldest
organisation in the struggle for liberation, has  made  a  very  significant
contribution to the liberation of Africa, and Africa  in  turn  reciprocated
by standing beside us  and  supporting  us  throughout  our  very  difficult
times, until we attained our ideal of freedom.

The role played by hon President Mbeki in this idea is a just reward to  the
people of Africa  for  the  support  they  gave  us  during  our  liberation
struggle. It is a just reward to the people  of  South  Africa  too,  as  it
ushers in victory that manifests  itself  in  plenty,  comfort,  jobs,  good
health, and good relations between South Africa and other African states.

All the heroes of the liberation struggle in this country and  in  the  rest
of the continent of Africa, like  Dube,  Kwame  Nkrumah,  Sontonga,  Mqhayi,
Chief Albert Luthuli, Khayingo,  Godolozi,  Goniwe,  Hani,  Tambo  and  many
others, left their indelible footprints on this same  trail.  By  addressing
the affliction of the continent of Africa, the  hon  President  has  touched
the spirits of these heroes and that is good.

Doubting Thomases pervade the world and we  shall  never  see  the  last  of
them. Let the frogs croak to their hearts' content  and  the  hadidahs  sing
endlessly. We, on the other hand, hail  the  efforts  of  this  son  of  the
nation. He is on the right track. He should keep  up  the  courage;  we  are
with him. We say to the hon President:``Forward!'']
Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Madam Speaker and hon members, the  need  for  an  African
partnership is  clear  and  compelling.  Divided  Africa  must,  every  day,
compete with united Europe, the powerful United States  of  America,  Canada
and countries like China and India, which have over a billion people each.

Clearly, this places African countries in a very weak position. We  have  to
have greater synergy and greater partnerships to enjoy economic growth.  For
the past 50 years, this dream of co-operation was  just  that  -  a  distant
dream. Now, however, everything seems possible, and the  role  being  played
by our President is that of a core leader.

The IFP supports the partnership initiative. We hope that it will be a  very
great success. This is, indeed, the  African  century  and,  therefore,  the
time of Africa is here. Let us, with  vision  and  courage,  go  forward  to
create a better future and a better life for all.

Ngiyabonga kakhulu egameni leNkatha Yenkululeko Yesizwe. [On behalf  of  the
IFP, thank you very much.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER IN  THE  PRESIDENCY:  Madam  Speaker,  Comrade  President,  hon
members I am sorry, but first of  all  I  am  going  to  embarrass  the  hon
comrade President.

After the hon the President had spoken, one  of  the  Ministers  received  a
note from his or her adviser. This person wrote a very moving  note  to  the
Minister.

The note says:


  Was the President not superb? Hearing him  speak  today  and  having  the
  vision so clearly spelt out renews my pride and joy that I was born here,
  and nowhere else. It is a privilege to be able to work for  South  Africa
  and for/with you.

I think that note speaks for all of us today. [Applause.]
I would like to start with something that Mr Van Schalkwyk  and  the  Deputy
Minister of Education have said. They raised the question of what we  should
do in our own country.

What do we have to do to raise the  level  of  political  consciousness  and
understanding of our own people about the heritage, history,  successes  and
weaknesses of our continent, as well as the rich and  varied  arts,  culture
and literature that exist? It seems to me  that  if  we  are  serious  about
ourselves as  a  Parliament,  as  provincial  legislatures  and  as  elected
municipalities, one of the things that we have to do, is to  work  and  work
and work again to  assist  all  of  us  to  raise  the  level  of  political
consciousness and understanding of our continent amongst our own people.

In my view, some serious challenges flow from that. I  want  to  talk  about
the rights of the child, women and people with disabilities. We  cannot  run
away from this challenge that we are facing. All of us  agree  that  one  of
the most important things that must happen is the regional integration  that
must take place in the SADC region and that we  must  work  at  as  great  a
speed as possible for free trade in the area. We cannot, as South  Africans,
escape the fact that, at some point in our lives, we will  have  to  say  we
cannot have a free trade area without the free movement of  labour  in  this
region. We thus address the  issues  of  our  people  in  the  region  in  a
different way than just trade  and  capital  movement.  We  talk  about  the
reality of movement, the free movement of labour and the  free  movement  of
people in our region. This is a challenge we face.

I think it is necessary to repeat - and the  hon  the  President  said  this
when he answered questions last week - that we cannot conceive  and  have  a
vision of development in Africa if we do not put the  empowerment  of  women
at the very central.  There  can  be  no  African  Renaissance  without  the
empowerment of women. [Applause.]

I believe it is the responsibility of all of us in Parliament,  in  all  the
political parties, to ensure that that ideal remains the  central  focus  of
all of us who are interested in this new  partnership  for  development.  We
cannot talk about dealing with the issues  of  conflict,  violence  and  war
without also saying what impact it has on children and women  and  what  the
consequences are for people with disabilities.

As we roll out our wonderful vision, we also have to  put  on  centre  stage
the rights of the child - the right of the child not to be conscripted  into
war, the right of the child not to have his or her limbs cut off, the  right
of the child to be a child, the right of the child to dream the dreams of  a
child. [Applause.] This is our responsibility.

Our continent is full of people with disabilities. It is our  responsibility
here, where we have made such great progress  with  regard  to  people  with
disabilities, to advance their rights. It seems to  me  that  we  have  more
people with disabilities in the South African Parliament than there  are  in
any other parliament. [Applause.] As we roll out this plan of ours,  I  want
to propose that we pay very special attention to the decision taken  by  the
OAU to declare 2000-2009 the African decade of disabled persons.  I  do  not
think  we  in  this  country  have  paid  sufficient   attention   to   that
declaration. And it seems to me that what we need to  do  is  to  take  that
declaration of the African decade of disabled persons and bring it into  the
mainstream of our  thinking  on  this  vision  that  we  have  of  this  new
partnership.

I would like to tell the hon the President that as I  was  sitting  there  I
was thinking about how far we have come along this road  of  African  unity.
There were names that came into my mind and there are some that I  am  going
to miss. But it seems to me that one of the great names that we need to  pay
tribute to, in addition to Peter Mundo, who now says that  he  is  an  Afro-
American too, is the great W B DuBois. The idea of a Pan-African unity,  and
Pan-African conferences that take place, was part of his vision.

 I am reminded of the great African leaders Patrice Lumumba, Kwame  Nkrumah,
Sekou Ture, Julius Nyerere, Samora Machel, Agostinho Neto,  Modiba  Keita  -
those hon members are going to Mali  this  weekend  -  Gamal  Abdel  Nasser,
Amika Kabral and our very very own, the great  Oliver  Tambo,  Chief  Albert
Luthuli and, of course, Nelson Mandela. [Applause.]

Therefore, I thought it was necessary, on  this  occasion,  for  us  to  pay
tribute to those great, great African heroes, who sacrificed  everything  so
that today we can stand here and say that we can realise this vision of  the
21st century being an African century.

I would like to tell the hon President that President  Bouteflika,  when  he
stood here and addressed us and at the state banquet held for  him,  paid  a
special tribute to our President, for the role that he, his party, the  ANC,
his Government, but above  all,  the  people  of  South  Africa,  played  in
assisting  us  to  come  to  this  vision.  Because,  without   the   active
participation of the people of South Africa, there will not  be  an  African
Renaissance.

In conclusion, a very great thinker, I  think  the  hon  members  can  still
remember his name, Karl Marx ... [Laughter.!] ... once said that -


  ... when an idea grabs the masses, it becomes a material force ...

I would like to tell the hon President that Africa's time has come.  Let  us
make it a material force! [Applause.]

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Madam  Speaker,  hon  members,  the  hon  Rev
Meshoe asked some difficult questions. He wanted to know why members of  the
National Defence Force are in Burundi, why they are prepared to  risk  their
lives by agreeing to be deployed there, and why we  are  prepared  to  spend
even a cent on this mission, when we need every cent we can  lay  our  hands
on to address our own domestic problems.

I would like to say that the reason our people are in Burundi is because  we
are committed to peace on this continent. [Applause.] We  are  committed  to
the promotion of democracy on this continent, and we are  committed  to  the
notion of human solidarity. That is why our people are in Burundi,  even  in
circumstances  where  there  might  be  a  risk  to  their  lives,  even  in
circumstances in which we may build a couple of houses less, but give  peace
to millions of people in Burundi. I think it is a price worth paying.

I would also like to thank the ambassadors and diplomats who have been  with
us the whole of this afternoon, sitting up here. [Applause.]  I  thank  them
for being here. In response to the important matters raised  by  Rev  Meshoe
that these ambassadors and high  commissioners  come  from  countries  whose
citizens risked their lives, whose  citizens  spent  money,  whose  citizens
took a chance in order to get us  to  gain  our  own  freedom  as  well  ...
[Applause.] ... I think it is only decent that we ourselves should act in  a
manner that recognises the importance of solidarity among human beings.

I must thank hon members who have paid tribute to other  presidents  on  our
continent who have been leading this process of  the  formulation  of  these
programmes, pointing the direction  as  to  where  we  should  go.  In  that
respect I would also like to mention the head of  state  of  Libya,  Moammar
Gaddafi, who indeed took very firm positions, which  enabled  the  continent
to take what are correct  positions  with  regard  to  the  process  of  the
African Union. [Applause.]

The  hon  Marthinus  van  Schalkwyk  and  others  have  said  that  Africa's
renaissance should be co-owned. I agree. It has to  be  co-owned.  We  must,
all of us as South Africans, see this as a matter that is  critical  to  our
future as persons and as a country. It has to be co-owned. That is  correct,
and I am quite certain that in that context, as he  said,  we,  all  of  us,
would indeed, have to abandon our political shacks. [Applause.]

The point was correctly made by the hon the leader  of  the  Opposition,  Mr
Tony Leon, as well as the Speaker and the Chairperson  of  the  NCOP,  about
the need for the involvement of  Parliament  in  these  processes.  That  is
correct. Hon members, as I said, are familiar with what is contained in  the
Constitutive Act of the African Union. I think it is important, as  the  hon
Leon suggested, that members of Parliament participate  in  the  process  of
defining even the details as to what  those  structures  visualised  in  the
constitutive Act should look like.

 It is correct that we shall  necessarily  have  to  move  beyond  the  mere
statement of principle to say what other institutions we must  establish  to
ensure that the vision that we have is  realised.  The  hon  Tony  Leon  was
correct with regard to that. We must include discussion by  this  Parliament
on what we do and how we shape and fashion the African parliament.  It  must
include the issue of how that African Parliament acts  to  ensure  that  the
governments on our continent act in a  manner  consistent  with  the  vision
spelt out in the African Union, as well as in the new partnership.

I say that there is some work to be  done  by  parliamentarians  and  it  is
urgent for settling, with regard to the African Union, what  was  agreed  at
the last OAU summit meeting. The African Union  will  be  launched  in  July
next year, and by that time all the bodies visualised in  that  constitutive
Act should be ready to be launched. There is  not  much  time.  I  therefore
agree that Parliament must be involved in these  processes  of  the  further
elaboration of all of these, and that includes issues pertaining to the  new
partnership.

The hon Tony Leon made reference to the fact of weak states  in  Africa.  He
used the expression that many are ``patchy entities''. I  agree  with  that,
and for that reason the matter of improving the capacity of those states  in
Africa is very much a part of the New Partnership for  Africa's  Development
Programme, because to deliver on  all  these  things  that  we  are  talking
about, whether it is the rule of law, good governance,  delivery  of  health
and educational services, water and so on, a state cannot be  weak,  because
weak states cannot do those things. It was quite  correct  of  him  to  draw
attention to this matter.

It is correct that we should not only depend on  peer  review  in  order  to
ensure that we implement decisions that we have taken, but  that  we  should
also involve the people in those processes. There is  an  important  African
institution - perhaps it does not have the  necessary  profile  now,  but  I
think that it should have a higher profile - called the  African  Commission
on  Human  and  People's  Rights.  As  an  independent  body,  the   African
Commission on Human and People's Rights does a lot of work and it  needs  to
be strengthened, and that becomes part of the process by means of  which  we
effect the review of what is happening to ensure  that  all  of  us  on  the
African continent do these  things  that  we  have  committed  ourselves  to
doing.

I must thank hon members for the support that they  have  given  to  all  of
these processes in which we have been engaged as a country  with  regard  to
the Burundi peace process. It is important and  difficult.  If  it  was  not
difficult, we would not  have  been  there.  We  are  there  because  it  is
difficult. We want to see what we can do to contribute to the best  possible
conditions for the Barundi to stop killing one  another,  and  to  stop  the
Barundi from conveying a message to the world that Africans can  do  nothing
but kill one another.

I am very grateful for  the  support  of  the  House  with  regard  to  this
particular process. I am certain that, whatever the difficulties, we have  a
challenge to stay the course with regard to that matter, and  to  make  sure
that we succeed.

That also holds true for the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We  shall  be
coming back to this House, because it is quite clear that in the context  of
the UN mission there, we shall have to commit more troops in the  Democratic
Republic of the Congo to assist that process in moving further forward.

I agree with the point made by the hon Lulu Xingwana, supported by  Minister
Essop Pahad, about the centrality of  the  emancipation  of  women  to  this
whole process of African renewal. Indeed, one could not  possibly  say  that
we have moved with regard to the renewal of the  continent,  while  we  have
stood still with regard to the emancipation of women.  Those  would  be  two
contradictory positions.

It is a central and critical issue, and I am  glad  to  tell  the  hon  Lulu
Xingwana that when we discussed the matter at the  SADC  summit  in  Malawi,
one of the decisions we took was that this item, bearing in  mind  the  1997
decision to which the hon member referred, should be a regular part  of  the
agenda of both the ministerial and the presidential head-of-state  meetings.
That would mean that  on  a  biannual  and  annual  basis,  we  will  get  a
consistent review of the progress that is being  made  with  regard  to  the
fulfilment of our obligation to change the situation in the manner that  the
hon member indicated. So, indeed, in this region we are very much seized  by
this issue. I am quite sure that she is correct  when  she  says  that  that
spirit is regional. We need to communicate that view  to  the  rest  of  the
continent as well.

 There is cynicism and scepticism, and I am sure there will be. It  is  part
of the political shacks that the hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk  talked  about.
Some of our  people  are  accustomed  to  that  particular  shack  of  Afro-
pessimism, of sceptism, of cynicism, of believing  that  nothing  right  can
come out of this continent. There are people who occupy that shack,  but  we
have done enough for ourselves, even just in  this  country,  to  know  that
they are wrong. They were sceptical and  cynical  about  us  here,  but  our
people have proved them wrong. They  are  wrong  about  the  future  of  the
continent, and the continent will prove them wrong. [Applause.]

It is true, as the Deputy Minister of Finance said, that we do not have  the
luxury of time. As we conclude this important discussion, all of  us  should
make a commitment that because we do not have the luxury of  time,  we  will
do the things that we have to do, inspired by a spirit of urgency.

Clearly, what we as the executive must do is communicate to Parliament  what
we are doing with regard to both of these issues at the  African  Union  and
the new partnership, so that Parliament can have a look at what it needs  to
do with regard to both programmes.
I also think  that  it  surely  must  be  a  responsibility  of  members  of
Parliament of both Houses, as they go out to the people, also  to  focus  on
this matter. This is because we want the ordinary people of our  country  to
know about these things and to engage in them. What is  visualised  is  such
an enormous process of change on our continent that it cannot  happen  above
the heads of the people.

So I would like to think that this is a  task  that  members  of  Parliament
would want to carry forward in their interactions with our people. But  what
we clearly have to do is work very hard and very consistently,  because  the
victory, which we know is assured, we also know will not come easily.

Finally, let me say that I was very  pleased  to  be  in  the  House  today,
because I think I have heard a statement made today of which there has  been
no equal in our country, in my view, since 1994. I refer  to  the  statement
made by the hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk. It is kinder, it is honest, it  has
a sense of direction, and it shows commitment  to  a  common  future  and  a
common destiny. I think it is a message that all of us should take  with  us
and that all of us should be inspired by, because that, indeed, is the  only
way to go. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
