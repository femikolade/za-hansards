                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr M R BALOYI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern reports that the Hout Bay Ratepayers'  Association
       is opposed to  the  handing  over  of  land  by  authorities  to  the
       community of Imizamo Yethu informal settlement;


  (2) believes that the resistance by  the  predominantly  white  Hout  Bay
       ratepayers  to  the  handing  over  of   this   land   reflects   the
       determination of this organisation to defend white  privileges  which
       they got under apartheid rule; and


  (3) calls on the Hout Bay ratepayers to desist from resisting change  and
       to work towards a fully integrated nonracial community of Hout Bay.

[Applause.]

Mr M L DA CAMARA: Chairperson,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a Mpumalanga mother is suing the state on  behalf  of  her
       daughter for deliberately  withholding  information  which  may  have
       prevented her from transmitting HIV to her child;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  there are an estimated 70 000 mother-to-child  transmissions  of
           the HI virus each year; and


       (b)  a once-off dose of Nevirapine costing a mere R30 would  decrease
           this risk by at least 50%;


  (3) recognises that President Mbeki must  take  responsibility  for  this
       failure by the state; and


  (4) calls on the Government to change its policy  before  many  thousands
       more children are infected, and the state  has  to  pay  millions  in
       damages.

Mr V B NDLOVU: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates and compliments  the  police  of  Springfield  Park  in
       Durban on their success in foiling an ambush  and  a  cash  heist  on
       Tuesday which involved an estimated R1 million;


  (2) further compliments these policemen and policewomen on tracking  down
       these robbers, and making subsequent arrests in the midst of  gunfire
       targeted at them; and


  (3) believes that such morale and motivation  will  gradually  decelerate
       the rate of crime in our society and entrench peace and security.

Mr R M MOROPA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that water  cuts  in  Tafelsig  by  the  DA-controlled  Unicity
       continue unabated despite widespread condemnation  of  this  inhumane
       action;


  (2) further notes that the continued water cuts affect  mainly  the  poor
       and the unemployed in the community of Tafelsig;


  (3) believes that everyone has a basic right to water and the water  cuts
       by the DA-controlled Unicity are an onslaught  on  this  basic  human
       right;


  (4) reiterates our condemnation of the water cuts in Tafelsig; and


  (5) calls on the DA-controlled Cape Town Unicity to make water  available
       to all, especially the poor.

[Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  four Cabinet Ministers failed or refused to attend a  conference
           on sex tourism which focused on the sexual exploitation  of  and
           trafficking for sexual purposes in children and  women  held  in
           Cape Town last week;


       (b)  sex tourism and trafficking in women  and  children  for  sexual
           exploitation has become a significant problem for  South  Africa
           in general and Cape Town in particular; and


       (c)  although South Africa's laws are shockingly inadequate  to  cope
           with this problem, nevertheless the Department  of  Justice  has
           put the drafting of a law to outlaw trafficking and sex  tourism
           on hold; and


  (2) therefore calls  on  the  Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional
       Development to revise this decision, in order to protect children and
       women against this  increasingly  prevalent  criminal  activity,  and
       calls on the Government to show more  commitment  to  protecting  our
       children and women from sexual exploitation.

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -
  (1) reminds the Government that the homes of thousands  of  residents  in
       the Cape Town Metropole were destroyed during the recent floods;


  (2) notes that President Mbeki visited the affected areas and declared 13
       townships disaster zones;


  (3) recalls that the MEC for Social Services and Poverty Relief, Mr David
       Malatsi, promised financial assistance to the residents;


  (4) places on record that suffering people to whom promises are made  are
       not interested in the loving or distant relationship between national
       and provincial government, and that they deserve fair treatment  from
       both; and


  (5) calls on Government to heed the call of the people for relief in this
       time of distress.

Mrs D G NHLENGETHWA: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the ANC has won all six seats that were contested  in  the
       local government by-elections in the Middelburg Municipality;


  (2) recognises that this is further confirmation of the  confidence  that
       the electorate has in the ability of the ANC as  the  only  political
       party that can solve the challenges that face our country; and


  (3) congratulates the  councillors  on  their  success  and  pledges  the
       support of this House to work together to  speed  up  change  and  to
       fight poverty.

[Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Chairperson,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its outrage at reports that some immoral male teachers  are
       raping schoolchildren, impregnating them and, in some instances, even
       infecting them with HIV;


  (2) notes with great concern that the increase in the rape of schoolgirls
       by teachers coincides with  the  introduction  of  pornographic  Life
       Skills flipcharts in our schools;


  (3) believes that encouraging children who are as young as eight years to
       discuss sexual intercourse, participate in, experiment and apply what
       they have learnt while using these pornographic flipcharts, is  going
       to make little fornicators out of schoolchildren  and  also  increase
       the incidents of rape of schoolchildren;
  (4) remembers that about two years ago two female teachers in  Mpumalanga
       forced schoolchildren as young as eight years  to  have  sex  in  the
       classroom; and


  (5) therefore calls on the Minister of Education to -


       (a)  withdraw all the immoral and pornographic  Life  Skills  charts
             from schools, especially primary schools;


       (b)   stop  the  abuse  and  encouragement  of  sexual  activity  of
             schoolchildren by those  teachers  who  are  perverts  and  use
             pornography to seduce innocent, unsuspecting children;


       (c)  stop teaching primary schoolchildren how to put on condoms ...


[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!
Mr M T GONIWE: Chairperson, on a point of order: I would like  you  to  rule
that that film show over there is totally out of order. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, can I address you on a point of order?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I have not given you  the  opportunity
to speak. Hon Goniwe, we will check and come with  a  ruling  on  that.  Hon
member, do you want  to  complete  your  notice  of  motion?  You  have  not
completed it. I think you had about two minutes. [Interjections.]

Mr L M GREEN: Thank you. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Just  complete  your  motion,  hon
member.

Rev K R J MESHOE:


  (5) therefore calls on the Minister of Education to -


       (a)  withdraw all the immoral and pornographic  Life  Skills  charts
             from schools, especially primary schools;


       (b)   stop  the  abuse  and  encouragement  of  sexual  activity  of
             schoolchildren by those  teachers  who  are  perverts  and  use
             pornography to seduce innocent, unsuspecting children;


          c) stop teaching primary schoolchildren how to put on condoms ...


[Time expired.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Dr P W A MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek het  ...  [Mr  Chairperson,  I  have
...]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, at that corner,  you  are
making a noise. Can you please keep quiet? The  business  of  the  House  is
still on.

Dr P W A MULDER: Thank you, Chair.  Maybe  I  should  have  brought  my  own
pictures to attract  their  attention,  sir.  Next  time  I  will  do  that.
[Laughter.]

Ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek tydens die volgende sitting sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem van die Adjunkminister van Veiligheid en Sekuriteit,  mnr
       Joe Matthews, se uitspraak  dat  kundige  Afrikaners  nie  langer  as
       landsburgers geïgnoreer of  deur  mense  vervang  kan  word  wat  nie
       dieselfde ervaring het nie;


  (2) ook kennis neem van mnr  Matthews  se  erkenning  dat  Afrikaners  'n
       belangrike rol  gespeel  het  om  Suid-Afrika  se  infrastruktuur  te
       ontwikkel;


  (3) die uitsprake van mnr Matthews verwelkom en hom daarmee  vereenselwig
       en dit ten volle ondersteun; en


  (4) in die lig van hierdie uitsprake weer eens kennis neem  van  die  rol
       wat die Vryheidsfront speel om 'n wen-wen-oplossing vir almal in Suid-
       Afrika te bewerkstellig, asook die VF se standpunt dat Afrikaners  en
       die Afrikaanse taal se toekoms in Suid-Afrika bepaal gaan word en nie
       êrens in die buiteland nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[I hereby give notice that during the next sitting I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the statement by the Deputy Minister of Safety and Security, Mr
       Joe Matthews, that skilled Afrikaners can no  longer  be  ignored  as
       citizens or replaced by people who do not have the same experience;


  (2) also notes Mr Matthews' acknowledgement that Afrikaners  have  played
       an  important   role   in   the   development   of   South   Africa's
       infrastructure;


  (3) welcomes and identifies itself with these remarks by Mr Matthews  and
       fully subscribes to them; and


  (4) notes once again, in the light  of  these  remarks,  the  role  being
       played by the FF in bringing about a  win-win  solution  for  all  in
       South Africa, as well as the contention of the FF that the future  of
       the Afrikaner and the Afrikaans language will be determined in  South
       Africa and not somewhere abroad.]

Mrs N B GXOWA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that suspects involved in taxi violence  in  the  Eastern  Cape
       appeared in Umtata regional court yesterday;


  (2) commends the police for a swift investigation and  for  bringing  the
       alleged perpetrators to justice;


  (3) calls on communities to work  with  the  police  to  stamp  out  taxi
       violence; and


  (4) calls on taxi associations to work towards resolving disputes through
       peaceful means.

Mrs B N SONO: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the failure of SAA and Transnet to  fulfil  an  undertaking  to
       report to the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises regarding the
       financial statements of SAA;


  (2) expresses its concern at SAA  and  Transnet's  disregard  for  public
       accountability in view of the fact that taxpayers' money is  used  to
       keep these entities afloat;


  (3) questions why the Minister of Public Enterprises is refusing to  make
       public the remuneration packages of top executives at SAA; and


  (4) calls on the Minister to ensure proper transparency  with  regard  to
       SAA in the light  of  financially  questionable  decisions  taken  in
       relation to this organisation in recent years.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the cost of fluoridation will be R30 million per annum;


       (b)  this amount could be redirected to providing water  to  some  of
           the 7 million South Africans who lack access to piped water;


       (c)  less than 1% of treated water supply is consumed by humans;


       (d)  fluoride could be supplemented by adding  it  to  bread,  mealie
           meal or salt;


       (e)  the optimal dose of 0,7 parts per million in  the  water  supply
           requires constant surveillance, and  that  human  or  mechanical
           error is inevitable; and


       (f)  doses above 1 part per million  have  serious  implications  for
           health, including cancer,  fluoride  deposits  in  bone,  kidney
           damage, depressed thyroid function and weakened immunity; and


  (2) therefore calls on the Ministries of Health and of Water Affairs  and
       Forestry to suspend plans for water fluoridation or, if  they  refuse
       to  do  so,  to  provide  simple  mechanisms  whereby  provinces   or
       municipalities can free themselves from the fluoride affront.

Mr A G LYLE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with pride reports of planned cultural  festivities  and  sport
       activities which will take place at De Noon, near Milnerton, over the
       weekend;


  (2) further notes that the aim of the planned festivities is to close the
       gaps between local people and foreign nationals;
  (3) believes that these activities  will  contribute  positively  to  the
       fight against racism and xenophobia; and


  (4)  commends  Sanco  and  other  stakeholders   for   organising   these
       festivities.

                      TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Chairperson and hon members of  this  House,
we place before this honourable House the Telecommunications Amendment  Bill
for adoption.  The  process  culminating  in  this  Bill  has  been  one  of
remarkable consultation and consensus-building. It  has  been  described  by
some foreigners as one of the most  democratic  and  can  make  our  country
proud.

The process was  open,  transparent  and  inclusive.  Debates  were  vibrant
because competing interests made sure of that. However, in then end, no  one
got exactly what they wanted because we had to balance  competing  interests
and do what was best in the circumstances for the people of South Africa  in
the context of an asymmetrical society and an unequal economy in an  unequal
world.

In  January  this  year,  Cabinet  decided  to  take  a  path   of   managed
liberalisation   for   some   of   the   key   sectors   of   the   economy,
telecommunications being one of those. Such a decision was not easily  made.
It was deliberated upon at length and arrived at because Government  had  to
walk a tightrope and balance the contradictions that exist in  our  economy,
our society and the world.

The telecommunications sector is a major driver of  the  economy.  It  is  a
sector that is characterised by dynamism  and  rapid  technological  change.
The National Research and Technology Foresight Project,  undertaken  by  the
Department  of  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and  Technology  to  reform  South
Africa's science and technology systems, identified technologies and  latent
market opportunities that are most likely to  generate  benefits  for  South
Africa. These were found to be  in  the  telecommunications  infrastructure.
The project identified high  priority  and  investment  areas  which  should
allow  access.  Here  again,  telecommunications  infrastructure  was   high
amongst these.

The President's advisory  council  on  ICT  re-emphasised  this  importance.
However, the challenge is to shape this sector in a  manner  that  does  not
exacerbate the existing  inequalities  of  lack  of  access,  participation,
ownership and control from those who  have  been  historically  excluded  or
marginalised. Yet, on the other hand we have to ensure  an  environment  for
business that lowers input costs, makes it  competitive  in  the  world  and
delivers fair value.

The Bill  thus  balances,  firstly,  universal  access  and  service,  which
include  infrastructure  and   affordability.   It   also   balances   local
participation in ownership control and  management  between  small  and  big
industry  players,  yet  allowing  for  foreign  participation  through  the
injection of investment skills and  technologies  that  can  assist  in  the
creation of new services, opportunities and jobs.
It balances the role of the public as well as the private  sector.  It  also
recognises that it is impossible  for  the  public  sector  on  its  own  to
generate the huge  resources  required  for  the  infrastructure  needed  to
bridge the gap  between  the  haves  and  the  have-nots,  rural  and  urban
communities, black and white, and the  developed  and  underdeveloped  areas
and sectors of our country and region. It had  to  balance  the  progressive
possibilities  of  convergence   of   technologies   with   the   unintended
consequences that can widen the digital divide if not managed properly.

Managed  liberalisation  allows  the  introduction  of  a  second   national
operator, which will leverage state assets through the inclusion of  Esi-tel
and Transtel. It  allows  provision  for  a  feasibility  study  which  will
introduce service-based competition. A study will be conducted in  2003  and
such competition will be introduced in 2005.

Convergence of information and communications technologies  has  placed  new
challenges before us. Accepting this era of  convergence,  Sentech,  another
state-owned enterprise, is being positioned to play a  significant  role  in
Africa as a carrier of carriers. These inclusions give  concrete  expression
to our commitment made also to the African leaders in  the  partnership  for
Africa's development, as was stated by the President yesterday.

We have extended Sentech's role to include the  provision  of  international
gateway services, to operate  as  a  carrier  of  carriers  and  to  provide
multimedia services as a common carrier. We have  also,  on  a  nonexclusive
basis,  allowed  value-added  networks  and  ISPs  to  provide  aspects   of
multimedia. Sentech will provide such infrastructure as is required  of  any
common carrier on an equitable nondiscriminatory basis.

Such a direction may not please those whose view is that we  should  go  the
big bang route or for open competition that lets the market decide.  History
has taught us that the  market  can  sometimes  be  imperfect.  The  current
global situation is an example of  such  imperfection.  Therefore,  we  must
remember that we are a developing country on the African continent, and  not
a developed country.

Taking into consideration what has happened in Europe, where  operators  are
debt-ridden and auctions were used to sell 3G licences as a way  of  raising
the highest amount of capital, which ultimately was a failure, we  in  South
Africa have opted to grant such licences  to  existing  operators.  Consumer
interest and industry interests had to be balanced, but this cannot be  done
in a  vacuum.  The  timing  is  also  important.  The  conditions  currently
prevailing  in  the  telecommunications  sector  globally,   place   certain
imperatives upon us in which we have to make choices.

Industry needs certainty before they enter the arena of competition.  Unless
one has competition, the consumer does not come  out  the  winner.  However,
the compromises made by different interest groups should, in the  long  run,
contribute to some advantage. The thorny issue  of  pre-selection  has  been
brought forward so that this service could be available by the end  of  2003
and number portability by 2005, and we hope  to  introduce  that  amendment,
too, in the process in the NCOP.

There are areas in South Africa  where  teledensity,  the  number  of  fixed
lines  per  100  people,  is  less  than  5%.  These  are  referred  to   as
underserviced areas. Co-operatives or consortiums in  these  areas  will  be
granted licences to provide voice-over IP, fixed mobile services and  public
pay telephones.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, you are  making  a
great noise there. Please, can you just lower your voices?

The MINISTER: By  law,  due  regard  will  be  given  to  applications  from
previously disadvantaged individuals, groups or  women  from  those  groups,
who own, manage and control their entities. I am particularly proud  of  the
provision in this part of the Bill,  which  makes  it  mandatory  for  women
applicants to own, control and manage their  consortiums.  [Applause.]  This
is in line with our objective of empowering women in the  telecommunications
sector.
It gives me particular pleasure to state that there  is  something  in  this
Bill providing for co-ordinated action  to  assist  the  sick,  injured  and
distressed, through the creation of a public emergency system for  the  good
of the public. For the first time,  South  Africa  will  have  a  nationwide
accessible single emergency number. Everyone in the country, old and  young,
rich and poor, must know this number. We have to teach it to  our  children.
The number is 112. My 90-year-old aunt will remember it, even though she  is
likely to comment that it does not exercise her mind. We thank the  Minister
of Finance for allocating R80 million for the realisation  of  this  project
during this year.

Despite widely held perceptions that powers and functions of  the  regulator
were being undermined by trying to fix something that was not broken, it  is
important that the relationship between  Government  and  the  regulator  is
clearly  understood.  The  powers  of  the  regulator  to   take   decisions
independently, not only from  Government,  but  also  from  other  interests
including the media, are crucial.

We need to ensure that the  regulator  is  guided  by  policy  and  that  it
implements  policy.  The  processes  by  which  it  does  this   should   be
simplified. Whilst the former has been excluded from the Bill, to  be  dealt
with in the substantive Icasa Act, this Bill gives powers to Icasa  to  make
final rather than intended recommendations,  which  have  been  streamlined,
and discretionary powers have been granted to hold hearings and the  ability
to make regulations has been entrenched.

The  regulatory  processes  have  been  shortened,  as  requested   by   all
stakeholders. At the meeting of the President's advisory  council  on  ICTs,
great emphasis was placed  on  education.  The  access  of  schools  to  the
Internet is an important aspect of this. This Bill allows  for  a  dedicated
education network. A laudable  achievement  of  this  Bill  is  that  a  50%
discount or an e-rate on calls will be given to public schools  and  further
education and training institutions.

Our  Government,  committed   to   the   transformation   agenda   and   the
Reconstruction and Development Programme, remains  fully  conscious  of  its
role in meeting the objectives of black economic empowerment. This has  been
achieved in this  Bill,  through  set-asides  of  up  to  30%  for  economic
empowerment in major licences.

The universal service is to be restructured for greater efficiency, and  the
universal fund will be utilised to assist in expanding universal  access  by
financing  projects  and  subsidising  a  roll-out  of  public   information
terminals, the first 100 of which were launched in all nine  provinces  last
week. Small and medium enterprises, co-operatives, etc will be  involved  in
projects facilitating this universal access.

All that we have achieved in this Bill has been achieved  despite  the  fact
that we had to move from a market structure that had previously entailed  an
exclusivity period for Telkom, which we had to move  to  an  initial  public
offering. Secondly, South Africa is a signatory to the WTO, and in  1997  it
had   indicated   its   intention   to    liberalise    trade    in    basic
telecommunications.
This Bill, despite some views from other quarters, is  consistent  with  our
country's general trade policy and specific obligations  as  signatories  to
the WTO and with the policies of partners.  To  achieve  this  was  no  easy
feat. I  therefore  wish  to  thank  in  particular  all  the  parties  that
participated in the public processes held  by  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Communications. They were tenacious, sometimes  unyielding,  but  this  made
the final outcome a product, I hope, all of us can live with peacefully.

Stakeholders that were active were the Development Bank of Southern  Africa,
which is an infrastructure funder, Icasa, the regulator, Telkom  and  future
competitors Esi-tel and Transtel, the cellular operators  MTN,  Cell  C  and
Vodacom, Vans and Sava, Multichoice, Sentech and others.

My special thanks go to the chairperson, Nkenke Kekana, who  had  to  manage
the various interests and focus on achieving  the  best  product  under  the
circumstances, for the benefit of all. I wish, also, to  thank  the  members
of the portfolio committee, many of whom were the  voice  of  the  consumer,
for burning the midnight oil on many occasions, to ensure the  best  results
they  could  achieve.  Their  role  makes  us   proud   of   democracy   and
parliamentary processes in representing the interests  of  the  majority  of
our people.

To the Director-General in  the  department,  the  Deputy  Director-General,
advisers and staff, I wish to say a big thank you. This huge task could  not
have been achieved had they not focused on the strategic importance of  this
sector, this country and this region in policy, and had they  not  given  of
themselves to walk the extra mile. They accepted in humility that  sometimes
there is another way to achieve what this country needs.

A special thank you goes to a few young black lawyers whom we  dragged  into
this process, fortunately not kicking and screaming. We  hope  the  exercise
was an empowering  one  and  that  we  have  laid  the  foundation  for  new
expertise in this sector.

I would just like to say, ke a leboga [I thank you]. Ndithi molweni  bahlobo
bam [I say hello my friends].

HON MEMBERS: Molo! [Hello!]

The MINISTER: I hope you can accept and  pass  this  Bill.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

Ms M SMUTS: Chairperson, may I express our thanks to our colleagues  in  the
New NP and the FA for their debating time on behalf of Mr Gore  and  myself.
Communications policy is in fact the first formally adopted DA policy.  And,
we oppose this Bill on behalf of all the three parties because it  conflicts
with our DA policy.

A few months ago, the hon the Minister  executed  a  number  of  spectacular
policy flip-flops around the question of whether Telkom should have  one  or
two competitors. Today, she has taken  the  feat  of  flip-flopping  to  new
heights. I would like to tell  the  hon  the  Minister  that  this  is  pure
trampoline artistry. To force compliant ANC MPs in one week  to  change  and
excise clauses on fixed mobile and carrier preselection and then  to  change
back on the day of the debate, as we were advised this morning,  is  frankly
unbelievable. I heard the Minister referring  to  carrier  preselect,  which
will now be dealt with by the NCOP, but I did not hear a reference to  fixed
mobile..

Naturally, it is the industry pressure at work again. In  South  Africa,  it
seems that the industry which leans on Government last, when time runs  out,
is the one that gets what it wants, also from a pliant Parliament.  So  much
for principle and the public interest, alas.

The 1996 Act put us in South Africa on course  for  competition,  first  and
foremost, by creating the basic regime for  nondiscriminatory  licensing  by
an independent regulator. This amending Bill departs from that approach;  it
licenses by statute. It also licenses by stealth, a matter  I  will  get  to
under the subject of convergence. Government itself has essentially  decided
who gets the  new  licences  -  and  it  is  Government  itself  -  and  now
Parliament turns this into law.

Of course, there may be great merit in the idea of unlocking  the  value  of
Esi-tel, Transtel and Sentech. But why not amend their own  laws  and  allow
them to apply for licences together with  consortium  partners  produced  by
market  forces  and  commercial  processes?  Are  we  going  to   have   one
shareholding Minister with a finger in all  three  ``telco''  pies,  not  to
mention two of the ``cellcos''? Is it the same  Minister  who  must  approve
and who can change  the  regulators'  licencing  decisions  and  regulations
before they are gazetted?

In contrast to this centralising  approach,  we  believe  that  it  is  real
competition that delivers more lines and telephones at tariffs  that  people
can afford. The Telkom model has now demonstrably failed  in  this  respect.
In return for exclusivity, Telkom had to roll out millions of lines. But  it
has had to disconnect a reported two thirds of  the  new  lines  because  of
nonpayment.  Of  course,  it  has  to  recover  its  costs  elsewhere.   Its
anticompetitive behaviour towards the value-added  network  industry  is  no
doubt explained by the fact that it had to compensate for these losses.

Unfortunately, Government has now, as a matter of policy, chosen facilities-
based competition for the second operator. We received  no  real  answer  to
the question why on earth Government insists that a competitor must build  a
second-last link into the end user's premises.  Perhaps it is because it  is
not Government who is doing the insisting.

We, for our part, believe in service-based competition with facilities roll-
out built in as a right or obligation, where  appropriate.  We  cannot  stop
Government from choosing pure facilities-based competition, but we  do  hope
it will not overload the second operator with obligations  like  the  Telkom
roll-out. A second operator must be allowed to skim some cream to  establish
itself through the links it would build  to  big  customers,  especially  in
circumstances where this law will cut the umbilical cord to  the  facilities
of the dominant incumbent after a mere two years when the  baby  cannot  yet
sustain itself.

We believe that the dominant incumbent should be accessible, always, to  new
players, with the regulator keeping a sharp eye on facility leasing,  resale
and interconnect rates, and that the new service-based operators  riding  on
the existing family copper  should  be  helped  in  every  way  by  consumer
devices like carrier selection which the hon  the  Minister  threw  out  but
which she now intends to put back in.

Roll-out in the name  of  the  poor  is  the  unexamined  justification  for
everything Government does, but when it demonstrably  does  not  work,  real
service-based competition must be given a chance, especially  in  the  local
loop which remains closed. New Zealand, for example, with  a  population  of
3,5 million and  over  400  local  loop  operators  has  some  of  the  best
teledensity and the lowest tariffs in the world. We are, of course,  pleased
with even the limited opening up of local  access  licences  in  areas  with
under 5% teledensity.
I have always thought that the mom-and-pop business is the right  model  for
South Africa. I must say that the bias towards female-owned businesses,  now
built unblushingly into this particular clause by our hon ANC lady  members,
could be just the right recipe: mom-and-mom companies. ``Your auntie in  the
telecoms business'' will  have  a  big  challenge,  but  she  is  getting  a
wonderful licence. She can do anything, including  the  voice-over  Internet
protocol which is irrationally being denied to the value-added services.

Among the very few clauses we could in the end support were  the  provisions
on Vans and Internet operators,  but  specifically  because  we  managed  to
clean them up. It is shocking  that  this  Bill  tried,  by  subterfuge,  to
circumvent and reverse  the  rulings  that  Icasa  made  after  a  year-long
enquiry.

Mrs M P COETZEE-KASPER: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I think I  heard
the hon member say ``your auntie''. I would like to know if she is  speaking
about our Minister, or which auntie.

Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, the new licencees - the  member  will  find  that
her colleagues agree. I spoke about the new licencees for the  local  access
licences.

It is shocking that Government was  ready  to  destroy  the  private  sector
industry on which the new economy rides. Half of  our  Vans  businesses  had
already packed up  because  of  the  ongoing  disputes  with  Telkom,  which
refused them facilities in order to corner the market  for  itself.  But  in
this respect we were able to do our job in Parliament, after  the  excellent
input of the industry, and I am glad to say that Icasa's work is now set  in
law. The one unresolved issue that remains is the refusal to allow  them  to
use voice-over IP,  putting  them  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  against
Telkom.

It was possible to reverse  the  Bill  on  this  issue  because  there  were
constitutional and other legal grounds at issue. The  same  applied  to  new
proposed appointment and removal procedures for Icasa.  I  am  glad  to  say
that MPs from the majority party also showed a healthy impatience  with  the
proposal which appeared to us to have come from Mr Eddie Funde. What was  it
doing in the Bill? I truly think that we are owed an answer. What  were  the
provisions on Icasa doing in the Bill? [Interjections.]

I thought that the ANC MPs, if they will allow me, did better this  time  at
applying their own minds rather  than  the  mind  of  the  Director-General,
right up until the last afternoon, although  he  was  quite  openly  leading
their caucus at one stage. The separation of powers has never been a  living
doctrine in this committee, I am sorry to say.

This brings me to the subject of licensing by stealth. Government  has  been
cheerfully insisting for seven months, in the face  of  ridicule,  including
our own, that there is such a thing as a fixed mobile service  and  that  it
has  something  to  do  with  convergence.  There  is  no  such  thing.  The
phenomenon is called wireless local loop, and it simply means that  one  can
connect end-users to the fixed line through radio  or  frequency  links.  We
cleaned up definitions until the so-called ``fixed mobile'' could  not  mean
anything except limited connectivity to a single cellular-based station.  We
did this to prevent fixed-line operators  breeding  little  regional  mobile
cellular services which the existing fixed licence forbids.

What followed is depressingly familiar  in  this  portfolio  committee:  the
executives pulled rank at the last moment and  the  MPs  collaborated.  What
was not familiar was the fact that a provision that we  had  already  agreed
to was changed overnight, before voting, to reintroduce wording  capable  of
delivering geographical mobile cells  by  stealth.  There  is  no  point  in
debate and work on legislation if a majority of MPs are going to cave in  to
the executives, at the end of it all, to this  extent,  and  the  compromise
that the chairperson drove with the industry off stage before  we  even  sat
down flies in the face of all transparency and public interest.

Today's latest trampoline flip-flop should,  I  hope,  teach  him  a  lesson
which he will not forget. My colleague the hon Mr Gore and I judged  rightly
in the case of a clause that really does try to deal with  convergence  that
we would be wasting our time if we did any work on the unworkable. That  was
after our first attempt to assist. After that, we walked out  one  night  to
break quorum and we sat talking about other things on other nights.

Convergence means simply that whereas services used to be defined  in  terms
of the medium over  which  they  were  transmitted,  for  example  telephone
services over fixed lines, the service  rendered  to  the  end-user  is  now
independent of the medium. That implies technology-neutral regulation.

Furthermore, one now gets voice, data and  video  over  one  pipe,  that  is
broadcasting, information, society services and telephony.  So  any  attempt
to define a service by its content is doomed. That is what happened  to  the
preposterous multimedia licence for Sentech, or Multimedia, as I decided  it
was more appropriately called. It started life  as  a  digital  broadcasting
service and looked very much like competition for M-Net's innovations.  Muti
was lining up against magic. Now because it is  constitutionally  impossible
to legislate such a thing under telecoms law, it changed first into a  Heath
Robinson interactivity device before settling down as  a  telecoms  licence,
still encompassing audio, video and so forth.

Now the  whole  point  and  the  entire  reason  why  we  must  have  a  new
communications  Act  is  that  in  the  new  converged   environment   where
broadcasting, telecoms and  information  society  services  are  transmitted
over one medium, one cannot  have  a  single  regulation.  One  cannot  have
broadcast or telecoms licences.  One  has  to  separate  the  regulation  of
transmission, where a pipe can carry all of the above,  and  the  regulation
of content such as e-commerce or broadcasting.

This also instantly solves the South Africa constitutional requirement  that
broadcasting regulation is constitutionally  protected  from  any  executive
involvement, whereas there can be an argument for a limited government  role
in telecoms. Hon members were  trying  to  squeeze  new  services  into  old
definitions, and it cannot work.

Unfortunately, all that has  been  achieved  is  a  clause  which  is  still
unclear, which therefore gives Sentech whatever the department really  wants
to give it, which through industry effort at least safeguards  their  vested
rights, but which does nothing for the country, sector or economy. In  fact,
it probably shuts down all  e-commerce,  because  entities  who  provide  e-
commerce cannot  be  licensed,  yet  their  services  are  included  in  the
definition. And this from a department that is  about  to  introduce  an  e-
commerce statute.

There  is  no  excuse  for  the  majority  MPs'  pleas  of  puzzlement   and
mystification  about  convergence.  We  had   an   intensive   briefing   on
convergence law by the European Union's experts last July. I do not know  if
the hon members remember that  on  the  day  after  our  briefing,  we  were
supposed to take a slow boat trip down the Rhine. We missed  that  boat  for
various reasons. I do remember joking at the time that South Africa too  was
in danger of missing the boat.

May I say that we are missing  the  boat  here.  Let  me  hope  that  as  in
Germany, where we hired buses and roared off down the banks  of  the  Rhine,
here, too, we will catch up. But, I would like to say to the Minister  that,
with respect,  her  Bill  ran  aground  and  was  shipwrecked  on  the  very
convergence, which she  and  her  department  continually  invoke  when  she
speaks about the digital divide. We have not begun to bridge it,  quite  the
opposite. [Applause.]

Mr N N KEKANA: Madam  Speaker,  Dene  is  at  it  again.  The  DP  has  this
mysterious ICT policy that we  have  yet  to  see,  and  yet  they  keep  on
referring to it, if ever the day does come when she produces this policy  of
hers. There is one thing missing, I would like to say  to  Ms  Smuts.  South
Africa has two worlds in one. One world is connected to the  Internet  -  it
has telephones. Another world has  no  access,  even  to  a  mere  telephone
instrument. [Interjections.] We  do  not  even  have  ``Nommer,  asseblief''
[Number, please]. There are  places  in  this  country  where  there  is  no
``Nommer, asseblief''.

There is one more thing I would like to say just for her information:  There
was no executive influence. What she has forgotten  is  that  Ministers  are
ANC members. In terms of their membership of the ANC, they  are  members  of
our study group here in Parliament - if the hon member  has  forgotten.  The
ANC respects separation of powers and we are not about  to  undermine  that.
[Interjections.]

The  Telecommunications  Amendment  Bill  before  this  august   House   has
attracted a wide range of interest. The financial  newspapers,  foreign  and
local industry players, including even a foreign mission, all wrote  to  the
committee and participated in the passage of this  Bill.  All  in  all,  our
committee received over 32 written submissions, and  we  conducted  a  week-
long public hearing session.

On behalf of our committee, I would like  to  thank  the  industry  players,
academics and legal advisers who participated in this process.  Many  thanks
to  all  the  directors-general,  departmental  officials,  the  state   law
advisers and our committee staff who were available and lent support  during
many long hours.

During the process, we decided to  engage  stakeholders  in  an  attempt  to
understand and accommodate  legitimate  concerns  to  the  extent  that  was
possible, in order that all interested parties  could  gain  something  from
the Bill. This has been a refreshing and  challenging  approach  and  I  can
safely say that this Bill bears the fingerprint  of  almost  every  industry
player.

Much was written and said about the proceedings of the committee during  the
amending stages. We have just heard  about  that.  There  were  speculations
upon speculations. There were rumours and half-truths regarding  behind-the-
scenes deliberations.

I want to tell Ms Smuts that in a democratic  system  of  policy-making  and
participatory law-making it is unavoidable that there will be an open  clash
of vested interests. This is the norm in a healthy, competitive  environment
and this ought to be expected. Thanks to this  very  inclusive  process,  we
have before this  House  today  a  Bill  that  has  dealt  fairly  will  all
interests raised and which is constitutional.

The Bill is a decisive step forward  and  has  always  sought  to  strike  a
balance between various interests and  objectives.  We  were  challenged  to
introduce competition that would benefit  industry  players  and  end-users,
while delivering universal service. Those  who  have  basic  telephony  want
more advanced services, while many in underserviced areas do not  even  have
access  to  a  public  telephone.  Further,  the  Bill  safeguards  existing
investments and rights enjoyed by  telecommunications  licencees,  while  at
the  same  time  responding  to  the  call  for  managed  liberalisation  of
infrastructure and services.

The  place  of  telecommunications  companies  naturally   is   to   protect
shareholder value, whilst our interest is  to  create  a  consumer-friendly,
technology-neutral policy environment where connectivities are available  at
an affordable price. The Bill is the outcome of the desire to bring about  a
basket of new services and opportunities through a delicate balancing act.

The  Bill  has  created  access  to  the  latest  technologies   and   other
opportunities  for  small  towns  and   villages   which   were   previously
underserviced. This Bill  will  improve  teledensity  whilst  simultaneously
creating an environment for regulated competition  in  the  urban  areas  to
benefit consumers and companies.

High-level skills development  is  what  our  country  needs  urgently.  The
Ministry and the department should continue to  expand  in  this  particular
area of skills development, and we must challenge  South  African  companies
to  recruit  and  employ  young  entrepreneurs  and  university   graduates,
especially those  from  the  previously  disadvantaged  communities,  to  be
trained in high-level skills. South Africa must  seize  the  initiative  and
leapfrog into  the  future  without  repeating  the  mistakes  of  developed
economies.

This Bill accepts the paradigm  of  an  information  society.  We  must  all
accept that the information society is a reality and the growth of  the  ICT
sector is a  product  of  history,  circumstances  and  development.  It  is
critical  that  all  countries  benefit  from  the  opportunities   of   the
information society.

South Africa and the rest of the  African  continent  must  attract  foreign
direct investment by having a firm, clear and stable  legal  and  regulatory
framework.  The  digital  divide  between  developed  and   less   developed
countries must be addressed and ultimately closed.  We  were  all  eager  to
know the outcome of the President's initiative on ICT and we hope  that  the
Ministry will, at  an  appropriate  time,  brief  our  committee  about  the
exciting projects and programmes identified at the George ICT legotla.

This piece of legislation before us begins, even if it is in  a  small  way,
to address the challenges created by the convergence of  telecommunications,
broadcasting  and  IT.  The  borders  between  the  various   platforms   of
technology are  fast  disappearing.  We  need  a  strategy  to  address  the
challenges of multimedia and a  converging  information,  communication  and
technology future. That is what we need. One needs a strategy  first  before
one comes with a law, Madam Smuts.

The Bill affords Sentech, an entity owned wholly by the state, a licence  to
build  a  common  carrier  backbone  infrastructure  to  provide  multimedia
services. The information society is primarily  about  the  availability  of
broadband multimedia services for households, institutions  and  businesses.
The building of an interactive infrastructure, with the  capacity  to  carry
large volumes of information at a faster rate  than  the  current  telephone
infrastructure of Telkom's network or the broadcasting  television  network,
is an urgent necessity for our country.

South African businesses require access to a broader bandwidth  and  Sentech
is positioned by this Bill to  provide  boundless  bandwidth,  either  using
satellite systems or optic  fibre  systems.  There  should  be  no  argument
against this noble intention by Government to build a Sentech network  as  a
high-speed and capacious common carrier.

The Bill does not exclude any of the existing  telecommunications  licencees
from providing multimedia services, nor is it creating an exclusive  licence
for Sentech. The Minister will invite more licence applications  from  those
who seek to  provide  multimedia  services  similar  to  those  of  Sentech.
Sentech is  now  in  a  better  position  to  provide  seamless,  high-speed
connectivity to  Internet  service  providers,  as  many  of  these  content
providers are demanding more bandwidth, because of the inherent  bottlenecks
in existing telephone networks.

Despite this exciting future for Sentech, we must not forget  that  many  of
our people have yet to make a single telephone  call.  Basic  telephony  and
the introduction of the second national operator to Telkom are necessary  to
build infrastructure and roll out services to our people. My wish  is  that,
within 10 years, South Africa's  teledensity  should  match  that  of  other
developed countries. To achieve this objective of at least 40%  teledensity,
we require a realistic strategy and a vision that recognises the  importance
of building an infrastructure and a skills base that is able to utilise  the
latest technologies to provide advanced interactive services.

Today, television programmes can be delivered through the Internet  and  the
Internet  can  be  accessed  through   television.   South   Africans   have
experienced one of the infant forms of  interactive  television  programming
through the Big Brother  show.  Although  the  soap  opera  content  of  Big
Brother might turn off certain viewers,  its  audience  ratings  demonstrate
the powerful nature of interactive services.

This Bill is not preventing any broadcaster from televising  its  programmes
in an interactive manner, except that the return path must be on a  licensed
telephone network. However, in the future, it will be  possible  to  provide
one pipeline for interactive television services.
Now,  to  address  the  matter  that  has  been  raised  more  often  -  the
competitive nature of our market. Let me put it this way:  The  introduction
of competition in the telecommunications sector raises a  number  of  issues
which concern not only policymakers and regulators, but also  potential  new
entrants,  consumers,  suppliers   of   telecommunications   equipment   and
incumbent  operators  and  service  providers.  There  is  no   doubt   that
competition will, in the long term,  lead  to  better  quality  of  service,
lower prices and  the  expansion  of  the  network.  But,  we  must  promote
competition in a controlled marketplace because it is difficult  to  monitor
uncompetitive behaviour. It is easier for the regulator  to  deal  with  the
possible misuse of market power by Telkom in a controlled marketplace.

South Africa is said to be one of the  few  countries  that  is  introducing
competition  in  the  provision  of   public   switched   telecommunications
services, while selling a large stake  of  its  national  telecommunications
monopoly. This Bill sought  to  create  a  favourable  environment  for  the
second national operator, while safeguarding the value of Telkom. It  was  a
difficult task, but we managed to achieve a fair  balance  between  the  two
nonantagonistic objectives.

The second national operator will inherit the network  and  skills  capacity
of Transnet and Eskom. This will enable it to roll out services at  a  rapid
pace and use the latest technologies to build a fixed mobile network,  where
possible. It will inherit a long-distance  network  and  have  access  to  a
larger subscriber base of both  the  electricity  utility,  Eskom,  and  the
telecommunications division of Transnet.

Of equal importance in the Bill is the guarantee  for  the  second  national
operator of servitude  rights  held  by  Transnet,  Eskom  and  SARCC.  This
provides for the right of way for the second national operator and will  cut
a lot of red tape regarding  negotiations  with  each  landowner  for  every
kilometre of their network expansion.

The second national operator will also be entitled to the resale  of  Telkom
facilities for two years on a  commercial  basis  while  they  are  building
their network.  After  the  two  years,  it  may  enter  into  a  commercial
agreement with Telkom for access to  telecommunications  facilities,  but  I
would like to emphasise here that it must build its own facilities.

The Bill provides for the second national operator to  enjoy  a  head  start
regarding access to the 1800 spectrum, which is important for  the  building
of the wireless fixed mobile local access network. Once the  local  loop  is
unbundled, it will be able to lease capacity from Telkom.

There are many other benefits for the second national operator, including  a
favourable, fair and nondiscriminatory interconnection regime that  will  be
closely monitored not only by the regulator Icasa, but also by the users  of
telecommunications services. The Bill has inserted  a  clause  that  demands
that interconnection rates and agreements be made public. I  think  we  will
benefit from this particular  disclosure,  because  for  many  years  Telkom
subscribers  were  disadvantaged  because  of  an   unfair   interconnection
agreement that favoured the mobile cellular networks.

We are confident  that  we  will  attract  foreign  players  to  the  second
national operator bidding process, despite a  slowdown  of  many  economies.
The investment in South Africa offers better opportunities, not only in  our
country, but also on the whole continent. Newspapers have already  begun  to
write about the spin-offs and prospects that will be created as a result  of
the second national operator licence. Today's  Business  Day,  for  example,
writes about the excitement of Motorola  at  the  prospective  opportunities
presented by the second national operator. They speculate that -


  ... the tender is set to become the country's largest investment  project
  ... and presents massive opportunities for  equipment  manufacturers  and
  service providers.

Equipment manufacturers have apparently been -
  ... talking to potential bidders for months;  all  anxious  to  win  what
  could be South Africa's largest communications contract for many years.

The network capacity of both Eskom and Transnet in other  countries  on  the
continent will offer the second national operator a footing on  the  African
continent. The managed liberalisation timetable also  offers  predictability
and thus guarantees a safe passage for its capital  investment,  which  will
be committed to infrastructure expansion in the short term.  It  will  offer
advanced and modern telecommunication  services  to  customers  and  compete
with Telkom head-on to service customers.

The second  national  operator  is  in  a  better  position  to  enter  into
competition with and challenge the dominant position of Telkom.  Telkom  has
enjoyed a monopolistic status  for  many  years  as  the  sole  provider  of
telecommunications services. However, attached to its  licensing  conditions
were stringent universal service  obligations,  including  the  roll-out  of
infrastructure and services to rural areas, which generally are not  at  all
lucrative. This monopolistic environment up to now  has  meant  very  little
price difference to the end users of services.

The improvements with  regard  to  Telkom's  traditional  problems  of  poor
services and customer care have been remarkable.  Although  customers  still
experience problems, the network operator has met the  various  targets  set
out in its licence conditions. The strategic  partnership  of  the  Malaysia
Telkom and SBC has now repositioned Telkom to face competition.

The fixed mobile convergence requires a technology-neutral treatment of  all
operators. Our mandate is  to  increase  teledensity  in  our  country  and,
therefore, we cannot restrict the use of a particular  technology  to  rural
areas only, as some of the submissions proposed. SMMEs will be  licensed  to
roll  out  fixed  mobile  services  in  rural  towns  and  villages.  It  is
disingenuous to argue for fixed-line operators to use fixed mobiles  in  the
underserviced areas only, while the cellular operators are not intending  to
use 1800 spectrum, apparently because of low teledensity.

As reported in weekend papers, Cell C will build GSM 1800 base  stations  in
metropolitan areas only. This is unacceptable. We hope that in the long  run
mobile cellular operators will use the 1800 spectrum  in  the  rural  areas.
Fixed mobile networks will be easy to deploy, will reduce maintenance  costs
for fixed-line operators and, once the initial  capital  infrastructure  has
been spent, revenue derived  from  cost  will  flow.  This  will  ultimately
benefit the consumer.

The committee received a wide range of submissions  on  number  portability.
The submissions could not put a definite figure on how much  it  would  cost
to  implement  and  what  the  level  of  demand  from  current   users   of
telecommunication services. It is estimated by some industry  analysts  that
it might cost anything in the region of R500 million  to  R1  billion.  Thus
far  the  committee  has  been  unable  to  determine  the  exact  cost   of
implementing number portability, and has therefore  considered  it  wise  to
leave the year of implementation as 2005.

It is also important for us to carefully consider the advantage  of  carrier
preselection.  We  support  the  latest  concession  that  the   period   of
implementation be shifted to the end of  2003.  Competition  is  also  about
choices. Consumers will have the ability to choose  between  operators  when
there is a better service from each of the  operators.  This  could  benefit
the consumer and might lead to a fierce price war.

Our Bill has even attracted the keen interest of entities  from  the  United
States, and we appreciate the attention. However, we do not agree with  many
of their submissions that seem to say that we have  departed  from  our  WTO
commitments. We have looked carefully at the WTO commitments  that  we  have
made, and we are confident that we have honoured all of them.

This Bill, of course, has many  other  benefits  for  all.  It  particularly
empowers women, SMMEs and underserviced areas. While making  provisions  for
Edu-Net and toll  free  line  access  to  Government  information,  it  also
provides, as the Minister  has  indicated,  an  emergency  number.  But,  my
colleagues will address many of these benefits in detail later.

Thanks to the incumbent there  has  been  unprecedented  roll-out  of  basic
telephony in our country and the  building  of  a  modern  digital  network.
Today more clinics and schools in rural areas  have  access  to  telephones,
and this has contributed to improving communication  and  services  in  this
area.  Notwithstanding  that,  much  still  needs  to  be  done  to  improve
teledensity and the roll-out of infrastructure and services in these  areas.
Much still needs to be done to  enable  everyone  in  our  country  to  have
access to a telephone  line  with  fax  capacity  and  low-speed  data,  and
eventually join the information society.

It is for this reason that we are passing this  enabling  Bill  to  lay  the
building blocks for the future and to provide a better life  for  all.  This
is a good law  and  should  pass  the  test  of  constitutionality.  We  are
satisfied that this Bill has  created  a  fair  balance,  it  has  tried  to
accommodate the interests of all and we would  be  surprised  if  the  DP  -
although they talk about some mysterious policy - opposed this good law.  We
would be very surprised, but we would like to thank all other  parties  that
have  participated  in  this  process.  We  have  come  up  with  the   best
legislation under  the  circumstances  and,  of  course,  we  await  further
briefings and work regarding this particular sector. [Applause.]

Ms S C VOS: Madam Speaker, it is for good reason that  the  IFP  started  to
refer  to  this  Bill  in  its   caucus   as   ``the   Bill   from   hell''.
[Interjections.] I arrived here with my  supporting  and  opposing  speeches
until I heard the Minister  for  myself  today.  Week  after  week  our  IFP
mandate vacillated from outright opposition to  qualified  support  when  we
thought that progress was being made and then back to  opposition.  Fourteen
pages of amendments agreed to in the Portfolio Committee on  Communications,
and the one-minute-to-midnight amendments resolved last night  and  outlined
by the Minister today, give a clue to the  importance  of  this  legislation
and the intense negotiations which have  ensued  day  and  night  over  many
weeks. In essence we have been  confronted  with  the  ugly  face  of  state
capitalism, and it has not been a pretty sight.

Much in this Bill is excellent, but the  devil  is  always  in  the  detail.
Until last night in many respects this Bill  prioritised  the  view  of  the
telecommunications monopoly, Telkom,  and  effectively  entrenched  Telkom's
monopoly until 2005. The IFP implacably opposed this as anticompetitive  and
I had been directed to oppose this Bill in  this  debate  in  the  strongest
possible terms. Today my mandate has changed again.

Common sense has fortunately prevailed and we  now  find  ourselves  in  the
position of being able to congratulate  the  Minister  for  saving  the  day
overnight on the issues of  carrier  preselection  and  number  portability.
Today, because the executive has finally agreed to amendments long  proposed
by members of this legislature, including many in the  majority  party,  the
IFP is able to support this Bill, with reservations. We anxiously await  the
text as mentioned by the Minister in her speech that will  emerge  from  the
National Council of Provinces as promised.  This  is  clearly  a  matter  of
trust and also includes  the  matter  relating  to  so-called  fixed  mobile
services..

From its conception, starting off with the department's  policy  directives,
the passage of this Bill has been characterised  by  subterfuge,  flip-flops
and, I must agree with the DA, the heavy hand  of  Government  interference.
It would be churlish not to praise the highly competent  chairpersonship  of
Mr Nat Kekana under very difficult circumstances. He was  exemplary  in  the
inclusive manner in which he attempted at all times to allow  the  portfolio
committee to interact time and again  with  stakeholders.  We  all  did  our
best, as the amendments attest to, but in politics that is  often  not  good
enough when fundamental issues are at stake.

The IFP would not compromise on the issue of carrier preselection and  being
enabled in 2003, and not as Telkom wanted it in  2005,  and  we  are  hugely
relieved that today this has finally been resolved, as well as  the  promise
of number portability after 2005. Better late  than  never.  Of  course,  we
have to publicly ask why this Bill,  in  its  previous  ever-changing  lives
before today, attempted to entrench Telkom's  monopoly  at  the  expense  of
enabling the much-needed and critical  investment  in  the  proposed  second
national operator.

Many of us believe that the answer  lies  in  the  tension  surrounding  the
forthcoming IPO of Telkom and the alleged strong-arm tactics  said  to  have
been employed by Telkom and its equity partner, Thintana,  comprised  of  US
and Malaysian shareholders. The nasty word ``blackmail'' was even  whispered
in relation to threats to dump shares.

But Telkom, having lost the fight to block carrier  preselection,  which  is
one of the essential  enablers  of  competition  in  the  telecommunications
sector, until 2005, must not feel too badly  done  by.  It  is  still  being
allowed to keep its vice-like  grip  over  many  aspects  of  the  industry,
including value-added network services which the IFP opposes.  It  is  still
being allowed to retain its anticompetitive monopoly of voice-over  Internet
protocol and its legislative ability to continue  to  spread  its  tentacles
throughout the industry, which the IFP also opposes.

But that is not all that is wrong with the  Bill.  The  truth  is  that  the
committee worked hard and tried to do  its  best  to  fix  up  the  mess  it
received. The Vans operators have won a victory of sorts in  that  they  are
finally properly defined along lines proposed  by  the  regulator.  You  win
some, you lose some. We started off with a  complex,  highly  technical  and
unconstitutional Bill, which was riddled with flawed policies and  ambiguous
clauses. Finally, many constructive improvements have been made.

Cell C must be happy that, at the proverbial eleventh hour, another  crucial
amendment, we have been told, will also go through the NCOP.  The  issue  of
the so-called fixed mobile and call handover between cells has finally  been
resolved and their lawyers can put their sharpened pencils back  into  their
pockets. The IFP wishes them well on  their  launch  next  month  and  looks
forward to Cell C proving that competition can, indeed, drive prices-down.

It should be instructive to this Parliament that, in  the  passage  of  this
Bill through the committee, a succession of  aggrieved  bodies  representing
billions of rands of investment in the industry in  South  Africa  lined  up
with their expensive lawyers and ICT experts and presented nearly 70  kg  of
documentation, because  I  weighed  it,  and  dozens  of  hours  of  debate.
Remarkably, even the US government, as members have  heard,  petitioned  the
committee. This tells us that time is long overdue for  this  Government  to
develop an effective ICT strategy and policy framework for the country,  and
legislation which will ensure  the  stability  of  the  sector  and  rapidly
promote investment and competition.

This House must also be alerted to the  outrageous  attempt,  in  the  first
draft of the Bill, to hobble the  industry's  regulator  -  the  Independent
Communications Authority of South  Africa  -  strip  Parliament's  portfolio
committee of its powers to recommend the appointment  of  Icasa  councillors
to the President and, if that was not bad enough, to  introduce  an  element
of broadcasting into telecommunications legislation,  which  the  department
should know by now is unconstitutional. This, too, was thwarted.

M-Net and MultiChoice, no doubt, still feel stabbed  in  the  back  and  the
front over the issue of multimedia services  which  has  not  entirely  been
resolved to  their  satisfaction.  Now,  their  lawyers  can  sharpen  their
pencils. Quite frankly, the IFP would welcome jurisprudence on the issue.

Finally, and ominously, it must also be recorded  that  many  of  the  well-
considered  recommendations  put  forward  by  our  regulator,  Icasa,  were
ignored and the department's barely veiled contempt for Icasa has set  alarm
bells ringing within the IFP and throughout the  industry.  Nevertheless,  a
luta continua: the struggle continues! [Applause.]

Ms N S MTSWENI: Madam Speaker, hon members, ladies and  gentlemen,  the  ANC
supports the Bill, as amended by the  committee,  because  it  reflects  our
policy of  managed  liberalisation  of  the  ICT  sector  in  the  phase  of
globalisation and the convergence of technology. In the  few  minutes  given
to me I will address three issues.

This  Bill  streamlines  both  the  application  and   the   decision-making
processes for telecommunications licences. This has  been  done  because  of
the practical difficulties experienced in  the  recent  application  of  the
third cellular operator. At the core of this was the role of  Government  in
the  decision-making  processes  of  the  independent  regulator   and   its
relationship  to  Government  departments.  Although  allegations  of  undue
influence were never proved, the delay  in  issuing  the  licence  cost  the
country dearly. An opportunity was lost to introduce  competition  early  in
the cellular industry, which could have created jobs and  attracted  foreign
direct investment into the economy.

The saga of the third cellular licence brought to the fore the  need  for  a
stable, resourced  and  independent  regulator.  Sound  decision-making  and
regulatory procedures are necessary to limit litigation. I am  raising  this
against the backdrop  of  concerns  being  raised  by  stakeholders  in  the
industry and problems related to the regulator. On the other hand, the  very
same stakeholders tend to undermine and weaken  the  regulator  by  poaching
staff and certain expertise. Having said that, when  something  is  done  to
address the concerns, the opposition parties, especially the DA, claim  that
this is political interference by the ANC-led Government.

The Bill allows the Minister first to invite applications. It also  mandates
consultation between the Minister and Icasa on evaluation criteria prior  to
publication of the invitation to apply.  In  accordance  with  international
best practice, the Bill streamlines the application process by reducing  the
number of oral hearings and focusing on written  submissions  by  interested
parties  or  applicants.   Again  in  accordance  with  international   best
practice the Bill confirms the  presumed  validity  of  licensing  decisions
pending litigation regarding such decision, so that the litigation does  not
delay the licensing process.

The Bill clearly indicates that, in the  consideration  of  applications  in
terms of the Bill, due regard should be given to applications  from  persons
from historically disadvantaged groups, and applications  that  promote  the
empowerment and advancement of women in the telecommunications industry.

The recent  experiences  with  regard  to  the  endless  challenges  of  the
decisions of the regulator have the potential to have a negative  impact  on
investor confidence. We strongly feel that we  must  shorten  the  processes
and procedures to  be  followed  if  the  decisions  of  the  regulator  are
disputed. It is in this respect that the ANC advocated the  removal  of  the
formation of the mechanism  and  arbitration  committee  and  supported  the
current provisions.

The original Bill raised an  important  matter  for  debate  concerning  the
process of appointment of Icasa councillors.  The  question  is  whether  we
should involve Parliament in this  process  or  whether  it  should  be  the
preserve of the executive, particularly in the light of  the  provisions  of
the Constitution.

As the ANC we feel that we should have adequate time to  allow  this  debate
to  be  taken  to  its  logical  conclusion.  We  objected  to  the  current
provisions, mainly because of the  requirement  that  the  President  should
consult or  concur  with  the  portfolio  committee  and  Parliament  before
appointing the councillors. The ANC rejects  the  notion  of  the  President
asking for the permission or  consent  of  Parliament  in  making  executive
decisions. Instead we support the reversal, where the legislature  processes
and makes a recommendation to the President, who  will  then  take  a  final
decision. [Applause.]
Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, at the outset I need to  say  unequivocally  that
we will be supporting this Bill, irrespective of the fact that it  may  have
certain shortcomings. One will never get perfectly drafted legislation.

I want to tell the hon Ms Dene Smuts, please, not to try  and  underestimate
my intelligence. [Interjections.] [Applause.] She has a problem  because  of
the colour of her skin. [Interjections.]  She  believes  that  people  of  a
darker skin are irrelevant. [Interjections.] I want to  tell  her  something
else. Her party should be careful of its own RDP -  Rejection  of  the  Dark
People. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

May I advise the hon the Minister - and I say it humbly, for  who  am  I  to
advise her - that I think the law as  it  now  stands  ...  [Interjections.]
Shut up, man! Shut up! [Laughter.] [Applause.] That hon member is  not  even
greeting people in the corridors - who is he? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order!
Mr S ABRAM: The problem here  is  ...  [Interjections.]  ...  a  superiority
complex ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order!

Mr S ABRAM: Ou Koos, my maat, ek  het  nie  tyd  vir  vrae  nie,  asseblief.
[Interjections.] [Old Koos,  my  friend,  I  have  no  time  for  questions,
please. [Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon member! Yes, hon member?

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I  hold  no  brief
for these members here, but it is not  parliamentary  to  shout  at  members
``Shut up, shut up!'' [Interjections.] We must maintain the dignity of  this
House and the member is not doing that. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker ...
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Please wait, hon member. Hon  Van  der  Merwe,  I
take the point. We should indeed try to control our  tempers  and  speak  to
one another in a tone conducive to proceeding with our work. However,  there
is   nothing   unparliamentary   about   robust   debate.   [Interjections.]
[Applause.] Please proceed, hon member. [Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I want to tell hon members here that ...

...  as  julle  Abram  se  kind   aanvat,   raak   Abram   se   kind   wild.
[Tussenwerpsels.]  [Applous.]  [If  you  mess  with  Abram,  he  goes  wild.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]]

The Bill provides that Icasa will have certain powers. I want to  appeal  to
the hon the Minister that when Icasa - which has earned respect  for  itself
within the  sector  as  an  independent  communications  authority  -  makes
recommendations, the Minister should be very circumspect in  rejecting  such
recommendations.

South  Africa's  favourable  international   ranking   in   the   field   of
telecommunications is clear proof of the significance of this sector in  our
country's economic and social life. It is in this context that  we  approach
the Bill before the House.

Any discourse on the South African communications sector will be  incomplete
without particular reference  to  the  communications  giant,  Telkom  South
Africa Ltd, which officially came into being on 1  October  1991  and  whose
honeymoon period ends in May next year in terms of the  provisions  of  this
Bill.

Telkom's impact on the South African economy  is  best  illustrated  by  its
income over the past five years. In 1996 it was  R13 091  million  and  this
financial year, in 2000, it is R26 270  million.  Its  fixed  assets  almost
trebled from R14 210 million in 1996 to  R35 082  million  in  2000.  It  is
therefore financially viable with  potential  financial  spin-offs  for  all
sectors  of  our  population,  especially  the  historically   disadvantaged
sector.

In conclusion I want to make the point that when  we  approach  measures  of
this nature, we should see in them facets which will advance  the  cause  of
the majority of the people of this country.  Let  us  accept  that  many  of
those people do not know what a telephone looks  like.  They  did  not  have
access to a telephone. That is a sector of society that we are here to  help
promote and advance. Therefore it is virtually important  to  take  note  of
who stands at the podium and from what background they  come,  in  order  to
understand why they espouse certain views. [Interjections.]

The light is flickering so I am moving. [Applause.]

Mr R D PIETERSE: Mev die Speaker, mnr Abram het teenoor my gesê: Vat jy  aan
'n Abram, dan kielie jy 'n leeu. Hy kan wakker skrik  en  vir  jou  byt.  So
``Mrs'' Smuts moet pasop. [Madam Speaker, Mr Abram  said  to  me:  When  you
mess with an Abram, you are playing with a lion. He could wake up  and  bite
you. So ``Mrs'' Smuts must be careful.]

It is an absolute honour to participate in this debate. This debate  can  be
traced back to 9  February  2001.  In  his  state  of  the  nation  address,
President Thabo Mbeki raised the following points  in  this  House:  managed
liberalisation of the  energy,  transport  and  telecommunications  sectors;
ensuring a necessary climate of certainty, particularly  in  these  sectors;
and  the  public  listing  of  Telkom  as  part  of  a  broad  programme  of
restructuring of state assets.

If one reads the President's address in  the  context  of  the  New  African
Initiative, then one would understand and agree that the  Telecommunications
Amendment Bill as it is, is right in the middle of what needs  to  be  done.
Again, one should  accept  that  the  state  of  the  nation  address  is  a
programme of action for the nation, and we  should  all  participate  in  it
unconditionally. We cannot be selective and pick  out  the  things  that  we
like and agree with and then participate in them.

Mr T D LEE: [Inaudible.]

Mnr R D PIETERSE: Die agb Lee gaan dom bly as hy nie ophou praat en  luister
nie. Gegee wat van ons verwag word, wil ek graag  fokus  op  die  uitstaande
punte in hierdie wysigingswetsontwerp en dit  sluit  die  volgende  in:  Die
noodnommer, of 112 soos dit bekend sal staan, sal 'n tolvrynommer wees.  Die
Minister mag met  die  nodige  kennisgewing  die  noodsentrums  instel,  wat
bekend sal staan as 112-noodsentrums. Deur  hierdie  nommer  te  skakel  van
enige  plek  in  die  land,  sal  die  nodige  noodorganisasie,  hetsy   die
brandweer, die polisie, ambulans of selfs die kuswag, die inbeller  te  hulp
kan snel. Hierdie noodsentrum sal die kapasiteit  hê  om  al  die  amptelike
tale, insluitend gebaretaal, te kan hanteer.

Tot op hede het ons altyd  redes  of  verskonings  gesoek  waarom  daar  nie
voorsiening gemaak kan word vir die gestremdes, veral dowes nie. Stel  uself
voor: Die ergste gebeur met 'n dowe vrou op die platteland. Male sonder  tal
is die ontvangs wat so 'n persoon kry, onaanvaarbaar en sy word dikwels  aan
haar lot oorgelaat. Sy kan nie normaal praat soos  ons  nie.  Sy  is  in  'n
polisiestasie en die arme polisie verstaan nie gebaretaal nie. Ons  sit  met
die probleem wat die vrou te doen staan.

Hierdie regering het 'n beter lewe vir almal belowe,  insluitend  ons  mense
op die platteland en die gestremdes.  Hierdie  wetsontwerp  spreek  boekdele
van  daardie  belofte.  Verlede  Donderdag  het  ek  op   Wolseley   gepraat
betreffende hierdie wetsontwerp. Die mense  kon  skaars  hul  opgewondenheid
wegsteek, want  hulle  het  geweet  hierdie  wetsontwerp  praat  van  hulle.
Wolseley is so 'n nice plekkie tussen Tulbagh en Ceres. So is ook die  mense
van die Karoo. Die mense van Ladysmith en Zoar en Calitzdorp en  Haarlem  en
Uniondale. Dis almal mense wat hulle asems ophou en wag,  wanneer  word  die
wetsontwerp in werking gestel. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Ons mense glo die regering is 'n regering vir die mense. Dit is 'n  regering
wat omgee vir mense. Ons mense het ook en wil ook, oor  die  lengte  en  die
breedte van die  land  met  ons  regering  en  ons  onderskeie  departemente
kommunikeer. Hierdie wysigingswetsontwerp se antwoord op hierdie  vraag,  is
dat Icasa 'n viersyfernommer moet bekend stel, wat die mense sal kan bel  om
na die departement  deurgeskakel  kan  word.  Dit  beteken  dat  iemand  wat
hierdie nommer skakel, sal deurgeskakel word  tot  by  die  departement,  en
hulle sal die nodige informasie kan verskaf of tot verdere hulp wees.

Hierdie nommer kan natuurlik van enige plek geskakel  word  en  sal  ook  in
elke amptelike taal beskikbaar wees.  Gegee  dat  Telkom  'n  mededinger  of
selfs meer gaan kry in Mei 2002, kan  ons  mense  veral  op  die  platteland
uitsien na dienste waarvan hulle nog net gedroom  het.  Ons  moet  natuurlik
vergeet  dat  die  DA  klokslag  olie  op  die  vuur  gegooi  het   en   die
wysigingswetgewing as 'n klug bestempel het. Die agb  mej  Smuts  het  haar,
soos gewoonlik, male sonder tal aan vloermoerdery skuldig gemaak.

'n AGB LID: Wat?

Mnr R D PIETERSE: Vloermoerdery. Geen hulp kan natuurlik  van  die  res  van
die DA verwag word nie.  Hulle  is  òf  deel  van  die  sirkus  òf  gedwonge
toeskouers wat moes toekyk hoe die leier ontslae raak van  'n  intellektuele
reus, of sal ek sê dwerg, mnr Peter Marais. Dít kom van 'n party wat sê  die
werkloosheidsyfer is te hoog.

Natuurlik kan daar nie na hul leier as 'n rassis verwys word nie, net  omdat
die gewese burgemeester 'n bruinmens  is  wat  taamlik  baie  bruin  stemme,
veral op die Kaapse Vlakte, vir die DA ingebring het nie. Aan mnr Bester  en
mej Walker word niks gedoen nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Mnr  Marais  se  probleem
het begin toe hy durf waag het om die strate na mnr Mandela en mnr De  Klerk
te vernoem, en nie na mnr Leon en mnr De Klerk nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Mnr Van Schalkwyk is ongelukkig nie hier nie, maar ek is doodseker sy  mense
sal die boodskap aan hom oordra. Hy sal nooit weer  die  hoofnar  wees  nie.
Dié kroon sit stewig op die kop van die leier van die  opposisie  binne  die
opposisie. Mnr Van Schalkwyk se enigste  kans  op  enige  prys  sal  in  die
Republiek van die Wes-Kaap wees, maar dan moet hy gou speel.

Soos die DP agteraf was met mnr Marais, so was  hulle  ook  in  die  komitee
agteraf, en dit gaan regdeur. Die DP gee nie  om  ...  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Is
dit die Dalmations Party? Die DP  gee  nie  om  of  ons  mense  telefone  of
geriewe kry nie.

Die mense van die platteland, die voorheen onderdruktes,  sien  uit  na  die
inwerkingstelling van dié  wysingswetsontwerp.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Die  ANC,
die  mense  se  party,  die  ANC   wat   regeer,   steun   dié   wetsontwerp
onvoorwaardelik. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr R D PIETERSE: The hon Lee is going to remain stupid if he does not  stop
talking and listen. Given what is expected of us, I would like to  focus  on
the salient points in this amending Bill and these  include  the  following:
The emergency number, or 112 as it  will  be  known,  will  be  a  toll-free
number. The Minister may establish the  emergency  centres,  which  will  be
known  as  112  emergency  centres,  with  the  necessary  notification.  By
dialling this number from anywhere in the country, the  necessary  emergency
organisation, be it the fire department, the police, ambulance or  even  the
coast guard, can rush to the  caller's  assistance.  This  emergency  centre
will have the capacity to be able to  handle  all  the  official  languages,
including sign language.

To date we have always looked for reasons or  excuses  why  provision  could
not be made for the disabled, particularly deaf people.  Imagine  this:  The
worst happens to  a  deaf  woman  in  a  rural  area.  Countless  times  the
reception that such a person receives is unacceptable and she is often  left
to her own fate. She cannot talk normally like we can. She is  at  a  police
station and the poor police do not understand sign language.  We  then  have
the problem as to what the woman should do.

This Government promised a better life for  all,  including  our  people  in
rural areas and the disabled. This Bill speaks volumes about  that  promise.
Last Thursday I spoke in Wolseley regarding  this  Bill.  The  people  could
barely conceal their excitement,  because  they  knew  that  this  Bill  was
referring to them. Wolseley is a nice place between Tulbagh  and  Ceres.  So
are the people of  the  Karoo.  The  people  from  Ladysmith  and  Zoar  and
Calitzdorp and Haarlem and Uniondale. These are all people who  are  holding
their breath and waiting for the Bill to come into effect. [Interjections.]

Our people believe the Government is a Government for the people.  It  is  a
Government which cares about people. Across the length and  breadth  of  the
country our people have, and also want to, communicate with  our  Government
and our various departments. This amending Bill's answer  to  that  question
is that Icasa must introduce a four-digit number which people  can  dial  to
be put through to the department. This means that  someone  who  dials  this
number will be put through to the department,  and  they  will  be  able  to
provide the necessary information or be of further assistance.

Naturally, this number can  be  dialled  from  anywhere  and  will  also  be
available in all official languages. Given that  Telkom  will  have  one  or
even more competitors in  May  2002,  our  people  in  the  rural  areas  in
particular can look forward to services of which they have only dreamed.  Of
course, we must forget that the DA regularly  threw  oil  on  the  fire  and
labelled the amending legislation  a  farce.  Countless  times  the  hon  Ms
Smuts, as usual, had a tantrum.

An HON MEMBER: What?

Mr R D PIETERSE: A tantrum. Of course, no help  can  be  expected  from  the
rest of the DA. They are either part of the circus or forced spectators  who
had to watch the leader get rid of an intellectual giant, or  should  I  say
dwarf Mr Peter Marais. This comes from a party which says  the  unemployment
figure is too high.

Of course, their leader cannot be referred to as a  racist,  merely  because
the former mayor is a coloured person who brought in a fairly  large  number
of coloured votes, particularly on the Cape Flats, for the  DA.  Nothing  is
being done to Mr  Bester  and  Miss  Walker.  [Interjections.]  Mr  Marais's
problem began when he dared to name the streets after Mr Mandela and  Mr  De
Klerk, and not after Mr Leon and Mr De Klerk. [Interjections.]

Mr Van Schalkwyk is unfortunately not here, but I am quite sure  his  people
will convey the message to him. He will never again be the main clown.  This
crown is firmly on the head of the  leader  of  the  opposition  within  the
opposition. Mr Van Schalkwyk's only chance at  any  prize  will  be  in  the
Republic of the Western Cape, but then he must act quickly.

In the same way that the DP was underhand with Mr  Marais,  they  were  also
underhanded in the committee, and that goes right through. The DP  does  not
care ... [Interjections.] Is that the Dalmations  Party?  The  DP  does  not
care whether our people receive telephones or facilities.

The people of  the  rural  areas,  the  previously  oppressed,  are  looking
forward to the introduction of  this  amending  Bill.  [Interjections.]  The
ANC, the people's party, the ANC which  is  governing,  supports  this  Bill
unreservedly. [Applause.]]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon  members,  telecommunications
is all about being connected. This Bill limits the opportunity to  diversify
our telecommunications industry, thus constraining the  potential  speed  of
social  and  economic   growth   that   this   country   so   badly   needs.
Communications, as we all are aware, is  a  human  activity  that  includes,
amongst others, transactional arrangements, positive  human  enablement  and
economic opportunity. In other words, the diversity in human  needs  demand,
therefore, diversity in our communications options and services.

If  this  Bill  becomes  law,  our  society  will  still  be  one  that   is
disadvantaged by relatively high telephone costs.  Telkom  still  remains  a
protected  parastatal.  Yet  this  Bill,  if  it  was  truly  interested  in
deregulating the telecom market,  would  have  limited  the  anticompetitive
operations of Telkom.

This Bill creates two sets  of  problems:  Firstly,  it  fails  to  generate
confidence  in  our   society's   ability   to   develop   its   competitive
competencies,  and   secondly,   it   especially   fails   in   its   social
responsibility to narrow  the  digital  and  communications  divide  in  our
nation. Telecommunications is not about compromises  with  parastatals  such
as Telkom. It is about cutting costs, market leadership  and  rapid  growth.
Telkom underscores in these areas.

The Government's about turn in allowing for only one new fixed-line  licence
must take responsibility for the tardiness in the building of value  of  our
telecom  system.  It  has  been  shown  that  where  countries  aggressively
liberalise their telecommunications industry, the  overall  growth  benefits
to those countries increased proportionately.

The amendments to this Bill entrench state interference in  the  process  of
open market democracy. Prior to the  latest  amendments,  this  Bill  showed
promise of stability and potential growth in the telecommunications  sector.
It is for these reasons that the ACDP will abstain from voting in favour  of
this Bill.

Dr P  W  A  MULDER:  Voorsitter,  vergun  my  eers  'n  ongewone  woord  van
gelukwensing aan mnr Pieterse,  wat  hier  in  ANC-Afrikaans  met  ons  mooi
gepraat  het.  Ek  dink  dit  is  die  eerste  keer  dat  die  woordjie  vir
``tantrum'' in Engels, die Afrikaanse ``vloermoer'', hier  gebruik  is,  vir
die Hansard. Ek dink dit is baie goed  en  ons  gaan  nog  ver  kom  op  dié
manier.

Hierdie is 'n  baie  tegniese  wetsontwerp,  wat  as  hoofdoel  het  om  die
omgewing te beskryf en te  reguleer  nadat  Telkom  se  eksklusiewe  periode
verstryk het. Die wêreld van kommunikasie en  telekommunikasie  is  een  van
die mees dinamiese, met daaglikse nuwe tegnologiese deurbrake  wat  verander
van tyd tot tyd, en dit bied 'n uitdaging aan alle lande  se  parlemente  en
wetgewers om by te hou.

Die uitdaging vir Suid-Afrika en hierdie Parlement is om  met  wetgewing  en
wetswysigings te sorg dat ons nooit by die wêreld agter raak  nie.  As  mens
eenmaal agter raak, gaan mens nooit weer bykom nie. Dit is  wat  so  moeilik
is in hierdie wetsontwerp om by te kom by die  werklikhede  van  Suid-Afrika
en ook die tegnologie aan die ander kant in ag te neem.

Die portefeuljekomitee het letterlik vir dae lank  oggend,  middag  en  aand
gesit - ongelukkig vanweë my nuwe verpligtinge kon ek talle  sittings  slegs
op die televisiemonitor volg. Ek moet tog die  voorsitter,  mnr  Nat  Kekana
gelukwens met die wyse waarop gepoog is om soveel inspraak moontlik  in  die
wetsontwerp toe te laat. Ek is reeds 13 jaar in die  Parlement  en  ek  moet
eerlikwaar sê, 14 bladsye amendemente sou  nie  voor  1994  gebruiklik  wees
nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek het geen pensioen nie, nie op die vorige een  nie.


Soos met alle wette, is daar  positiewe  en  negatiewe  aspekte  in  hierdie
wetsontwerp. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Chairperson, firstly, allow me to extend an  unusual  word
of congratulations to Mr Pietersen who  spoke  beautifully  to  us  in  ANC-
Afrikaans here. I think this is  the  first  time  the  Afrikaans  word  for
``tantrum'', viz the word ``vloermoer'', has been used here, in  Hansard.  I
think that this is very good and that we are going to go a long way in  this
manner.

This is a very technical Bill and it has as its main objective  to  describe
and regulate the environment after Telkom's exclusive  period  has  expired.
The world of  communication  and  telecommunications  is  one  of  the  most
dynamic, with new technological breakthroughs daily which change  from  time
to time, and this presents parliaments  and  legislators  in  all  countries
with a challenge to keep up.

The challenge for South Africa and this Parliament is to ensure, by  way  of
legislation and statutory amendments, that we never fall behind the rest  of
the world. Once one falls behind, one will never catch up. This is  what  is
so difficult in this Bill, namely to come in  line  with  the  realities  of
South Africa, whilst at the same time taking technology into consideration.

The portfolio committee literally sat morning, noon and night  for  days  on
end - unfortunately, due to my  new  duties,  I  was  only  able  to  follow
several sittings on the television monitor. I really must  congratulate  the
chairperson, Mr Nat Kekana, on the manner in which an attempt  was  made  to
allow as much input as possible to be given in  relation  to  this  Bill.  I
have been in this Parliament for 13 years now, and I must honestly say  that
14  pages  of  amendments  would  not  have  been  customary  before   1994.
[Interjections.] I have no pension, not on the previous one.

As with all legislation, there are positive and  negative  aspects  to  this
Bill.]

The FF supports, for example, the Minister and the director-general  in  the
establishing of the new 112 emergency centres that will enable end users  to
be connected to it by dialling 112. I think there  are  a  lot  of  positive
things in that and much good can come from that.

However, there are also quite a few clauses that  will  create  problems  in
future. On the negative side, for example, there was the confusion - I  said
here ``there is the confusion'', but I  change  it  now  to  there  was  the
confusion - on the issue of carrier preselection,  and  promises  have  been
made that this will be addressed in the NCOP.

So, at this stage, we are still keeping our options  open,  but  I  think  I
will advise my caucus to vote for the Bill the moment it  is  clear  how  it
will all end up.

Miss M N MAGAZI: Mr Chairperson,  hon  members,  comrades  and  compatriots,
ladies and gentlemen, Parliament  passed  the  Telecommunications  Act,  Act
103, in 1996. The Act has 17 objectives. The last objective,  that  is,  the
17th one, was to promote the empowerment and advancement  of  women  in  the
telecommunications industry. I wonder, and I just want to ask the  industry,
how far we have gone  in  respect  of  this  objective.  I  want  our  major
operators to report to Parliament  on  how  they  have  contributed  towards
objective 17 of the Telecommunications Act.

I want the operators to give us a report that  indicates  their  performance
in respect of this objective over the past five years.  I  want  to  propose
that the Portfolio Committee on Communications should call all operators  to
table, in Parliament, a report on how they have  ensured  that  the  primary
objective of the Telecommunications Act, Act 103 of 1996, have been met.

During the public hearings on the amendment to  the  Act,  I  did  not  hear
anyone addressing the issue of how the promotion and  advancement  of  women
in telecommunications would be dealt with. I would like to call  on  Telkom,
Vodacom, MTN, Cell C and other providers to take all the objectives  of  the
Act seriously, particularly objective 17. I call in  particular  on  Telkom,
our major operator, to do its level best to ensure  that  their  development
programme   should   cater   for   the   advancement   of   women   in   the
telecommunications industry. We want more role models like  Irene  Charnley,
Pinky Mohodi, Nkhetheng Vokwana, Joddy Desai and others.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, Minister, the  telecommunications  service  is
one of the most frequently used and important means of communication in  the
daily lives of the world, be it business or pleasure, national, domestic  or
international. We have Graham Bell to thank for the  invention,  and  Telkom
to thank for the better connection.

Telkom, being the leading organ for telecommunications in South Africa,  has
made its service available for years, and has served us  on  an  exclusivity
basis. At the end of Telkom's exclusivity period, the Bill sets out to  make
available liberalisation and competition of the market that  in  turn  would
promote   and   enhance   economic   growth,   national   development    and
reconstruction. All that sounds extremely attractive.

Though a lot of competition would appear healthy,  a  strong  framework  and
foundation is necessary. A thorough plan of action has to be  put  in  place
and the co-ordination of the process should be efficiently  and  effectively
supervised. It is one thing putting  pen  to  paper,  but  implementing  the
result intended through action is another. However, the Bill does appear  to
have investigated its avenues and calculated its intentions.

Telecommunications appear here to provide for  growth  and  enhancement  for
the nation's people and the Government, as well, is  one  of  the  backbones
connecting us to the world and to each other. The  need  of  the  market  is
evident and a diminishing need is not only rare, but impossible.

The MF supports the Telecommunications Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Mr Lee, can you help me  to  crack
the whip as a Whip on that side. There is a big noise at the back,  starting
from your bench.
Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, this Bill creates a legal framework for the  South
African  telecommunications  landscape,  following  the  end   of   Telkom's
monopoly.

Despite a lot of technical things, the main question is the extent to  which
the telecommunications industry must be regulated or left to the  trends  in
the free market with  competition  and  business  as  the  main  determining
factors. The AEB stands firmly for the  free  market  with  the  minimum  of
state interference. We foresee a South Africa where civil society will  play
a greater role and Government will play a lesser part.

The question is whether this  important  sector  of  the  telecommunications
should be left to the free market alone. We must keep in mind  that  we  are
not talking about the market for cars, furniture or  refrigerators,  but  we
are talking about the most important requirement that a country as  a  whole
must have, namely wall-to-wall communications facilities.  Why  is  this  so
important? May I quote one example?
Die veiligheid op ons plase is een voorbeeld. Die  landbou-organisasies  het
voorstelle vir landelike veiligheid gemaak wat daarop neerkom dat  boere  in
'n selfoonnetwerk met mekaar in onmiddellike kontak moet kan  kom.  Daar  is
egter  'n  probleem.  Daar  is  baie  afgeleë  gebiede  wat  eenvoudig   nie
selfoonontvangs het nie, en net anderkant die werf staan sowel  'n  MTN-  as
'n Vodacomtoring en daar is dubbele dekking. As ons alles aan  die  vryemark
oorlaat, gaan daar altyd gebiede wees wat geen dekking  geniet  nie.  Daarom
moet daar steeds 'n mate  van  regulering  wees.  Dit  is  een  van  daardie
bedrywe.

Natuurlik kon hierdie wysigings verder gegaan het. Die agb  Smuts  het  baie
van die gebreke uitgewys, maar ons moet in gedagte hou dat ons  met  hierdie
wetsontwerp beweeg van 'n totale monopolie na 'n groter  mate  van  beheerde
kompetisie. Om nou terstond oor te gaan na volle deregulering sal  nie  werk
nie. Dit is inderdaad so dat baie van die  verbeterings  wel  op  nommer  99
aangebring is, soos die saak oor die preseleksie. Ons vra  nie  wanneer  die
verbeteringe aangebring is nie, maar of dit gedoen is. In  die  lig  van  al
hierdie  oorweginge  gaan   die   AEB   hierdie   wetswysiging   ondersteun.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The safety on our farms is  one  example.  The  agricultural  organisations
made proposals for rural safety  which  amount  to  the  fact  that  farmers
should be able to contact one another immediately by means  of  a  cellphone
network. However, there is a problem. There  are  many  remote  areas  which
simply do not have cellphone reception, though just a few metres  away  from
the farms there are both MTN and Vodacom towers, so  that  there  is  double
coverage. If we were to leave everything to the  free  market,  there  would
always be areas that have no coverage. For that reason there must  still  be
some degree of regulation. It is one of those industries.

Of course these amendments could have gone further. The  hon  Smuts  pointed
out many of the deficiencies, but we must bear in mind that with  this  Bill
we are moving from a total  monopoly  to  a  greater  degree  of  controlled
competition. It simply would not work if we were to change over to  complete
deregulation immediately. It is indeed true that many  of  the  improvements
were made at the eleventh hour, for example in the case of preselection.  We
are not asking when the improvements were made, but whether they were  made.
In view of all these considerations the  AEB  will  support  this  statutory
amendment.]

Mr V C GORE: Chairperson ... [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: It seems we have a problem with the sound.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Can we look at it quickly,  please.  I
think the service officers should help with this. Continue, hon member.

An HON MEMBER: The member is not going to say anything anyway, he  might  as
well continue. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Can you try,  hon  member.  It  is  on
now. We are sorry for the inconvenience.

Mr V C GORE: Mr Chair, opportunities are usually disguised as hard work,  so
most people do not see or recognise them. This must surely be the case  with
the ANC and the Telecommunications Amendment Bill. [Interjections.]

As with many of their incorrect judgment calls, the ANC will  not  lose  out
instead it will be ordinary South Africans, and most notably the  poor  who,
in this case, will be deprived the choice of quality and affordable  telecom
services, and hence improved teledensity. I  sincerely  hope  that  in  this
case the old adage that fortune knocks but once whilst misfortune  has  more
patience proves untrue, otherwise we as a country  will  suffer  because  of
the errors of the ANC.

But let me cut to the chase.  The  DA  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  1996
Telecommunications Act should have been scrapped, thereby introducing a  new
Bill, a convergence Bill, which enshrines  principles  such  as  technology,
neutrality, the convergence between broadcasting and telecoms,  as  well  as
the promotion of a strong and independent  regulator.  Instead  we  have  an
amending  Bill  that  concerns  itself  with  licensing   by   statute   and
centralisation through ministerial control,  amongst  other  half-baked  and
misguided intentions.

Foreign investment, which is critical if not essential for  the  success  of
Telkom, will not flow into this country without  a  strong  and  independent
regulator. The DA has long called for the full  constitutional  independence
of Icasa. The independence of Icasa could  have  been  further  strengthened
had this Bill ensured, for example, that the  regulation  making  powers  of
Icasa had effective legal standing.

Now for the cloak  and  dagger  situation  created  by  the  confusion  over
multimedia  or  ``mutimedia''.  Does  the  Government  intend   to   provide
multimedia services to end-users, or will it provide the infrastructure,  or
is this merely a clandestine move to allow  Sentech  to  become  the  second
national operator, in which  case  the  Government  would  have  significant
shares in all five - or is it six -  telecommunication  operators  in  South
Africa? We are awaiting an explanation on multimedia.

Another consequence, I presume unintended, or perhaps  it  is  intended,  is
the requirement that all providers and developers of  web  pages,  including
banks, on-line shops and B2B in South Africa, will now have to apply  for  a
multimedia  licence,  presumably  for  a  fee.  I  predict  that  with  such
retrogressive legislation, South Africa will become the  laughing  stock  of
the entire globalised world. We will perhaps only be  matched  in  terms  of
Internet restriction by countries such as China.

The entrepreneurial Vans which have over the years led the way  in  creating
new businesses, thousands of jobs and adding value,  have  had  their  hands
strengthened  against  the  goliath,  Telkom.  However,   they   are   still
unfortunately prohibited from making use of  voice-over  Internet  protocol.
This completely  ludicrous  provision  will,  in  the  words  of  Icasa,  be
impossible  to  monitor,  let  alone  enforce,  due  mainly  to  the  freely
available  software  over  the  Internet.  This  will   unfortunately   make
thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of  unsuspecting  people  overnight
criminals.

Another glaring shortcoming in this Bill  is  its  inability  to  adequately
address the question of local loop unbundling. Why  does  South  Africa  not
take its  lead  from  the  European  Union  in  accepting  that  it  is  not
economically viable for new entrants to duplicate the  incumbent's  metallic
local access infrastructure in its entirety within a reasonable time?

The EU's approach and the DA's  approach  would  have  been  to  ensure  the
second national operator had access to Telkom's metallic  local  loop  on  a
continuous, reciprocal and reasonable basis. This approach would  avoid  the
situation in the future of one operator ripping up copper wires to  a  house
or business so that another can put theirs in, and ensure that this  country
would continue to roll out universal access at affordable rates. Local  loop
unbundling would enhance competition, ensure economic efficiency  and  bring
maximum benefit to consumers. The country demands local loop unbundling.

In addition to local loop unbundling, the eleventh  hour,  all  to  familiar
now, executive flip-flop on carrier selection needs attention. We  now  have
a situation in terms of  which  Telkom  II  will  be  guaranteed  access  to
Telkom's infrastructure until  May  2004,  and  carrier  selection  will  be
introduced at an earlier date. Ideally, the DA would have preferred that  to
have been done now in order to  promote  competition  resulting  in  cheaper
calls.

With Telkom's history of bullyboy tactics, it appears highly  unlikely  that
they will provide the second national operator with infrastructure,  thereby
negating any positive outcome for carrier selection.  The  DA's  alternative
would be to guarantee it access to Telkom's copper forever.

I conclude with a quote by Maxwell Planck:


  A scientific truth does not  triumph  by  convincing  its  opponents  and
  making them see the light, but rather because  its  opponents  eventually
  die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.

I hope that the people of South Africa will not have to wait for the ANC  to
die out before getting proper communications services,  which  will  benefit
them, their communities and the economy. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr E S MAGASHULE: Comrade Chair, hon  Minister,  comrades  and  members,  of
Parliament, I think the DA or the DP is confused, that is  why  the  hon  Mr
Gore is calling the Chair ``Madam  Speaker''.  [Laughter.]  [Interjections.]
It is important to note that the  Telecommunications  Amendment  Bill  comes
after a critically  important  meeting  of  the  Presidential  International
Advisory Council on Information Society and Development.

This  Bill   recognises   the   convergence   of   the   telecommunications,
broadcasting and information services  industries.  South  Africa  is  still
burdened by the special form of colonialism that  has  shaped  our  country.
This legacy plays itself out in various spheres of our  society,  while  the
nature of public discourse is shaped by patterns of ownership  and  control,
such as that the poor and disadvantaged remain marginalised.

As we are discussing  this  amending  Bill  today  we  should  remember  the
President's state of the  nation  address,  which  outlined  his  vision  of
growth and prosperity for all in South Africa and the continent.  We  should
also remember that the President has elaborated on the goals of the  ANC-led
Government for the year 2000, stating that the poor are  at  the  centre  of
Government's plans for these coming years. The President's  announcement  of
a practical and strategic programme of action for  2001,  with  a  call  for
unity in action for change, has created a  communications  environment  with
new opportunities and challenges.

The hon member Ms Smuts must take note that as we are talking today, we  are
not just talking about technology  or  telecommunications.  We  are  talking
about telecommunications and the people. Our efforts, as the  Minister  once
said, to bridge the divide are primarily about people and not technology.

The  state's  vision  for  telecommunications  is  one  that  balances   the
provision of basic universal services  to  disadvantaged,  rural  and  urban
communities with the delivery of high-level services capable of meeting  the
needs of a growing South African  economy.  It  should  be  remembered  that
underdevelopment remains at the core  of  the  social  problems  that  South
Africa is currently facing. Therefore the extension  of  an  affordable  and
accessible universal service will enhance social and economic activities  in
historically  disadvantaged   communities   by   providing   the   necessary
infrastructure,   as   well   as   by   generating   employment    in    the
telecommunications sector  itself,  creating  opportunities  for  meaningful
employment  and  management,  effective   promotion   of   entrepreneurship,
licensing opportunities and procurement, as well as set-aside policies.

The adequate attainment  of  universal  access  and  service  goals  largely
depends on meeting the requirements of affordability. The  manner  in  which
the cost of services is determined through tariff regulation is  fundamental
to the achievement of universal services. The telecommunications  sector  is
key to the success of the Reconstruction and Development  Programme.  Access
to  communications  facilities  is  not  only  necessary  for  delivery   of
services. In critical sectors, such as education and health, it also  serves
to stimulate the creation of SMMEs and offers a channel of communication  to
reinforce participation in democratic processes.

South Africa needs a strong telecommunications equipment supply industry  in
order to respond to the development needs of the  country  and  to  position
South Africa appropriately for the twenty-first century. It  will  therefore
be important that a national asset such  as  Sentech  should  be  granted  a
licence to provide  an  international  telecommunications  gateway  service,
enabling it to operate as a carrier of carriers, and it  will  also  provide
multimedia services.

Sentech  should  therefore  act  as  an  integrated,  high-quality  network,
providing value-added services and access to the  international  information
highway to support the needs of South Africa's  internationally  competitive
industries and link its  economy  to  the  global  system.  Through  Sentech
improved communication with Africa will reinforce South  Africa's  presence,
by facilitating exchanges among  institutions  in  the  public  and  private
sectors and by providing opportunities for technology export.

Sentech's licence, for now, shall exclude the termination  of  international
telecom services directly to the end-users in  the  Republic,  but  I  hope,
with time, Sentech's licence shall include the termination of  international
communication services directly to end-users in  the  Republic.  Sentech  is
already  operating  a  digital   terrestrial   television   transmitter   in
Johannesburg as a pilot demonstrator. It  further  plans  to  roll-out  this
demonstrator to include more metropolitan areas and a few rural  areas.  The
significance of covering rural areas is to develop  and  offer  services  to
underdeveloped areas as a contribution to bridging the digital divide.

With regard to underserviced area licences,  the  Bill  seeks  to  stimulate
SMME  development   in   the   telecommunications   industry   through   the
introduction of underserviced area licences in areas where the  telebase  is
currently below  5%.  Underserviced  area  licensees  will  be  entitled  to
provide voice-over Internet protocol by May 2002. The question of  women  in
terms of SMMEs is also taken very seriously by the ANC-led  Government.  The
question of women's equity,  control  and  ownership  shall  be  taken  into
account when issuing licences.

In conclusion, as the President said during the opening  of  Parliament,  we
are marching into the new era of the African century as  Africans  who  have
made the determination that this century will be 100 years in which we  will
cease to be victims of our circumstances  and  become  victors.  By  passing
this Bill, we will be ensuring that underdevelopment is no  longer  seen  as
being synonymous with Africans. Through the passing of  this  Bill,  we  are
ensuring that poverty gives way to prosperity.

The DA, through Dene Smuts, says this is  a  flip-flop  policy.  There  have
never been different positions on the part of departments,  Government,  the
ANC  or  MPs.  The  position  has  been  one  of  managing   liberalisation.
[Interjections.] Secondly, the DA will agree with us that,  in  the  history
of South Africa, the ANC-led Government has  been  the  only  government  to
consult people  and  stakeholders,  and  take  into  account  the  views  of
minority parties. Dene Smuts should be happy that at times we listen to  her
illogical views, but there is no way we can take the illogical views of  the
DA and make them inputs of the ANC. [Interjections.]

It is also surprising that parties such as the ACDP and the FA,  which  have
never attended - I think the public must know this a single  public  hearing
or a portfolio committee meeting come here and project an image as  if  they
have participated in all the discussions. [Interjections.] There is  no  way
that the ``Green Party'' can abstain from participating here. In fact,  that
would be good, because we do not need their vote. [Interjections.]

There is nothing such  as  Government  interference  here,  as  the  IFP  is
actually saying. There is no monopoly by Telkom here. I think this  Bill  is
very clear and the ANC would like to commend it to  members  of  Parliament.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Chairperson, before I  proceed,  I  think  I
need to make a correction to the translation that was made  of  Mr  Pieterse
speech. He spoke about  "gestremdes",  and``gestremdes"  refer  to  disabled
people, not handicapped people. Can Hansard please check and correct that.

This is indeed a Bill about people,  but  as  we  indicated  before,  it  is
balancing the competing interests, so that we are not technology driven  but
needs driven. The needs of the people must  drive  us  and  not  technology.
That is what we have tried to achieve by this. [Interjections.]

The second thing is that it seems to me  that,  particularly  from  the  DP,
there is a lack of understanding about something. One can have all the  Vans
and all the ISPs that one wants, but unless one has  the  infrastructure  on
which they have to run whatever they are doing, we will  never  be  able  to
create the jobs or be able to have access to  all  these  things,  for  both
rich and poor. We do not govern only on behalf of the poor. We  always  take
into consideration the rich, but the priority is not the rich, the  priority
is indeed those who have always been on the margins.

Therefore, I would like to say I was quite surprised when I listened to  the
hon Dene Smuts, because there was a contradiction in her  saying  they  want
to create jobs, and yet they do not want to have infrastructure, or they  do
not seem to focus on infrastructure. It is the big players that come  in  to
lay the main infrastructure; that is why we have had to keep  this  balance.
In doing that balancing act we have taken big as well as small players  into
consideration, because it was indeed an open process.
To Mr Aucamp I would like to say: Ek dink veiligheid op die  plase  is  baie
belangrik. [I think that safety on the farms is very important.]

When we said we would have this clause about a public emergency service  put
into this Bill, it was precisely to attend to the fact that ...

... dit gaan nie net oor die veiligheid van die boere op die plase nie,  dit
gaan oor die veiligheid van al die mense. Daar is  baie  mense  wat  in  die
lokasies woon wat nie telefone het nie, wat nie die polisie of  'n  ambulans
kan ontbied nie. As ons dus praat van  veiligheidsmaatreëls  praat  ons  van
die mense, en nie net van dinge wat moet gebeur om  tegnologie  te  hê  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[... it does not only concern the safety of the farmers  on  the  farms,  it
concerns the safety of all the people. There are many people living  in  the
locations who do not have telephones, who cannot summon  the  police  or  an
ambulance. If we therefore refer to safety measures, we  are  talking  about
the people and not merely the things that have to take  place  in  order  to
have technology.]

There has been a lot of talk about subterfuge  and  executive  interference.
If hon members believe this, they believe it at their  own  peril.  I  think
everybody has a democratic right to lobby anybody, but  it  is  up  to  this
Government to say that we will make decisions,  despite  what  we  hear,  in
terms of what is best for everyone, balancing these acts that have  said  to
us: We need to move. Maybe we say it because we come out of a  revolutionary
situation. One has a revolution, but one does not always have  a  revolution
exactly the way one wants it to be.

There are forces on the other side that will also determine what actions  or
choices are possible for us. We have realised that we cannot get  everything
we want. We have to make painful choices, but our choices must be on  behalf
of the majority of this country,  and  also  at  the  same  time  make  good
business sense.

For those that have supported the Bill, particularly Suzanne  Vos,  I  would
like to say that she might come out of her nightmare, it might not  be  such
a ``Bill from hell'' after all. [Laughter.] I think when we  have  finished,
she might go and  have  a  very  peaceful  sleep,  realising  that  she  has
contributed a great deal to making sure that what  this  Bill  is  doing  is
indeed the best for South Africa. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Bloem, I would  appreciate  it  if
you could go back to your seat. [Laughter.] [Applause.]  Order!  Order,  hon
members! Order!

                     LAND AFFAIRS GENERAL AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Chairperson, the  Land
Affairs General Amendment Bill  before  the  House  was  drafted  to  effect
certain technical amendments to the Land Reform Labour Tenants Act  and  the
Extension  of  Security  of  Tenure  Act,  commonly  known  as  ESTA.  These
amendments emanate from  certain  experiences  of  the  Department  of  Land
Affairs, and various stakeholders in implementing of this  legislation,  and
aims to make it more efficient.

Clauses 1 through to 5, the first five clauses  of  this  Bill,  are  rather
technical amendments to the Labour Tenants Act, with the major idea to  make
the finalisation of projects more efficient and to  bring  it  up  to  date.
They also bring the provisions of the Labour Tenants Act in line with  ESTA,
the Extension of Security of Tenure Act, and in this  way  the  idea  is  to
treat all  farm  dwellers  equally,  whether  they  are  labour  tenants  or
occupants.

Specifically, the amendments provide associates of labour tenants  with  the
opportunity to obtain certain grants from the Department of Land Affairs  to
secure their tenure on the land that they live on and where they work.  This
was  especially  necessary  because  the  problem  which  we  had  was  that
beneficiaries often received grants under different pieces of  legislations,
which made it rather tedious for Department of Land  Affairs  officials  and
quite frustrating for the beneficiaries. We want to rectify that.

The court will also have  to  be  satisfied  that  labour  tenants  who  are
evicted in terms of a temporary order of eviction because of  urgency,  will
be ensured that  adequate  arrangements  have  been  made.  There  are  also
amendments which give additional protection from eviction to labour  tenants
who have reached the age of 60, and which give certain equal  protection  to
labour tenants and occupiers.

The main issue, in this Bill I think, is the question of burials  on  farms.
This is an extremely sensitive issue, which I think should be  treated  with
great sensitivity. In clause 6 of the Bill a  definition  of  the  so-called
established practice is given, and then clause 7 gives a  limited  right  to
occupiers to bury their deceased on the land  they  were  occupying  at  the
time of the death. It works in this way, that the  right  is  granted  where
there is a so-called established practice.  That  will  be  the  case  where
there are existing graves, and occupiers will have the right to continue  to
bury their family members who were residing on  the  land  at  the  time  of
their death. On the other hand, family members of  long-term  occupiers,  as
defined in section 8(4) of the present Act, will have the right to bury  the
deceased on  the  land  regardless  of  whether  there  was  an  established
practice.

Let me give members some information on the background to these  provisions.
One will have to go back to section 6(4) of the  Extension  of  Security  of
Tenure Act, which grants any person the right to visit and maintain  his  or
her family graves on the land which belongs to another  person,  subject  to
certain reasonable conditions. Then a person who qualifies  as  an  occupier
under section 1(1) of the ESTA legislation is in addition granted the  right
to reside on and use the land on which he or she resided before  4  February
1997. The Act states: ``to have access to such services as have been  agreed
with the owner or a person in charge''.

Occupiers under ESTA are also specifically granted the right - this is  very
important in respect of these amendments we are effecting -  to  freedom  of
religion, belief and opinion and of expression, which they  have  under  the
Constitution in any event, and the right to family life in  accordance  with
the culture of that family. It is actually  an  extraordinary  provision  in
our legislation, respecting the culture of the people of our country.

The Extension of Security Tenure Act provides  that  both  of  these  rights
must be balanced, in their enforcement, with the rights  of  the  landowner.
We had a few cases on this matter. There was the case of Serole and  another
v Pienaar in which the Land Claims Court said that to establish a  grave  is
not the kind of right which was intended to be granted to the  occupiers  in
terms of the tenure Act. The court said that it was,  however,  possible  to
bury family members on a farm if it could be  one  of  the  services  agreed
upon with the owner.

After that we had the case of Buurmann v Nkosi and another, at the  Pretoria
High Court, which said that the Extension Security of Tenure  Act  does  not
include the right to bury the dead on the  land,  nor  does  it  entail  the
rights to family life, freedom of religion and  belief,  or  give  occupiers
the right to bury their deceased family members on the land.  At  best,  the
Pretoria court said that one would have a right where an occupier  was  able
to prove an established practice  in  which  the  permission  was  routinely
granted to bury deceased families on the land.

There was a very important dissenting  opinion  from  the  Judge  President,
Bernard Ngoepe. He argued a  few  very  important  matters.  He  said  that,
firstly, the right to freedom of religion and belief includes the  right  to
manifest such a religion through conduct, quite in accordance  with  a  long
line of the type of court  cases  also  in  the  Americas,  and  that  would
include the right to bury the family members close to existing graves.

He also said that the right to freedom of  religion  and  belief  outweighed
the owner's rights in that instance. He  said  that  the  declaration  of  a
small piece of land as a grave was insignificant compared  to  the  hardship
caused to the family. He said that fears that an avalanche of burials  might
follow were not well founded and that section 6(2) of the  Constitution  did
not limit the right of freedom of religion and belief.

The Buurmann decision was appealed to  the  Supreme  Court  of  Appeal.  The
Supreme Court of Appeal upheld the  Transvaal  Provincial  Court's  decision
with a majority verdict. [Interjections.] Yes, indeed, unanimously.

Judge Howie said that a grave effects a permanent diminution  of  the  right
of ownership of the land. He said that it would amount to  an  appropriation
which is a classical absolute position on ownership as  an  absolute  right.
That is what was behind this. He also  said  that  it  was  undeniable  that
funeral and gravesite rights were very much part of religious  beliefs,  but
it could be said that those religious and cultural beliefs would  be  denied
if the burial was not permitted. In  other  words,  the  court  denied  that
right.

In actual fact, what the Court of Appeal said was that the  legislature  did
not give sufficient intention that the right to burials was intended in  the
legislation. He said that the legislature stopped short of  obliging  owners
and that it  would  not  have  been  a  real  drafting  problem  to  say  so
expressly. That is what we are correcting here today.

Let me just say that the outcome of these  cases  is  unfortunate.  Because,
before the Extension of Security Tenure Act was enacted, before  the  change
of Government in 1994, permission to bury farmworkers on the land  on  which
they were residing was, in most cases, granted.

Ons het nie vandag daardie voorreg om dit te doen nie. Die  ander  deel  van
Mattheüs moet ook gelees word, waar Christus gesê het dat hy honger en  dors
was, asook, ``vir soverre julle dit aan een van die geringstes  gedoen  het,
het julle dit ook aan My gedoen''. Dink mooi hieroor. Bring die morele  plig
terug en moenie dat hierdie wetgewing ons verplig  nie.  Ons  het  altyd  om
daardie rede mense op die plase begrawe. Dit was die waaragtige rede.

Kom ons keer terug na daardie motivering en begin nie net uit  aversie  teen
hierdie swart Regering 'n veldtog voer nie.  Laat  ons  nie  eiendomsreg  so
verabsoluteer nie. Dit is ook nie die tradisie van die  boere  nie.  Dit  is
nie die tradisie van die boere nie. Kom ons keer terug na  'n  morele  basis
hiervoor. Ek kon ongelukkig nie my toespraak  klaarmaak  nie.  Ek  sal  weer
opvolg in die repliek, maar  kom  ons  keer  daarheen  terug.  Laat  dit  om
daardie rede wees, omdat ons dit doen aan een van die  geringstes.  Ons  sal
daarom 'n graf op ons plaas beskikbaar stel en  dan  kan  die  wetgewing  se
morele  begronding  ook  ingesien  word.   Ek   staan   daarby.   [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Today we do not have the  privilege  of  doing  that.  The  other  part  of
Matthew should also be read,  where  Jesus  said  that  he  was  hungry  and
thirsty, and said: ``In so far as you have done this to one  of  the  least,
you have also done this to me.'' Just  think  about  that.  Bring  back  the
moral duty and do not allow this legislation to force  us.  We  have  always
buried people on the farms for that reason. That was the true reason.

Let us return to that motivation and not start a campaign  out  of  aversion
against this black Government. Let us not make property rights so  absolute.
That is also not in the tradition of the farmers. That is not  the  farmers'
tradition. Let us return to a moral basis in this respect. Unfortunately,  I
could not complete my speech. I will follow up on this in my reply, but  let
us return to this. Let it be for that reason, because we  are  doing  it  to
one of the least. That is why we will provide a grave on our farm  and  then
the moral grounding of the legislation can also  be  realised.  This  is  my
final word on the matter. [Applause.]]

Ms O R KASIENYANE: Chairperson, the piece of legislation that is  before  us
is an attempt to consolidate the restoration of the  human  dignity  of  and
respect for those who died and who were buried along the side of the road.

The Land Affairs General  Amendment  Bill  was  drafted  to  effect  certain
technical  amendments  to  the  Land  Reform  Labour  Tenants  Act  and  the
Extension of Security of Tenure Act, or ESTA. The amendments, as the  Deputy
Minister  has  already  indicated,  emanate  from  the  experience  of   the
Department of Land Affairs and various stakeholders who are responsible  for
the implementation of this legislation.

The land has always been close to the hearts of our people.  The  policy  of
the ANC is in line with this Bill:


  The land shall be shared among those who work it.
We are here to transform society. The Africans have always maintained  their
right to the country and the land as a traditional birthright of which  they
have been robbed. As legislators we need to be  very  vigilant  in  ensuring
that laws that we make are implemented. We  need  to  ensure  that  this  is
done, so that the people that this Bill is intended  to  assist  will  truly
believe that we are committed to transforming and bettering their lives.  It
is imperative for the Government to ensure  that  their  different  agencies
know and understand the law so that it can be implemented properly.

My focus in this Bill is on burial rights and visits to graves.  The  rights
to bury in accordance with the wishes of the deceased are important.  Lefoko
la moswi le agelwa mosako. [We respect the wishes of the dead.]

We have to respect a person while he is still alive and when he is dead.  We
have a belief that if a person's wishes are  not  accomplished,  she  or  he
will not rest in peace. That is why we always say: Rest in peace. How can  a
person rest in peace when  there  are  problems  even  before  he  could  be
buried? The costs that our people incur  when  preparing  for  funerals  are
very high. It is a process. It is our culture to go through so  many  things
before burying a person. There is a process, of  course,  that  one  has  to
follow when arranging for the funeral. One has to consult one's  church,  as
Christians, to make arrangements, also for a night vigil.

How and when can one do all these things while one still has to go to  court
for one's rights? Although there is an Act, some farmers  ignore  all  that.
The denial of access to graves is equal to the denial of respect.

We want to visit our graves unconditionally. Usually  relatives  and  family
members who were absent from the funeral will have to visit  the  grave  and
leave a little stone or some flowers to show their respect. It is  not  only
for the sake of remembering where the grave is, but also to speak and  pray.
Some of us pray and ask for  good  luck,  for  ``tata  ma  chance,  tata  ma
millions''.

People visit graves to ask many things, and to clean up the  graves.  It  is
our culture. It is a continuous exercise. By so doing, we  keep  all  future
generations informed. They  should  not  to  be  in  the  dark  about  their
ancestors.

The community of Leliespan outside Coligny in the North West province, if  I
may give an example, experienced the following problem.  They  were  refused
to bury the late Mr Albert Serole, who was a farmworker. Apparently  he  was
very ill for quite a while. His body laid  in  a  mortuary  for  four  weeks
before it was buried. He was buried along the side of the road next  to  the
farm where he worked for so many years.

Go ya ka setso sa rona le magosi a rona, lerapo la motho ga le  a  tshwanela
go bonwa le gogwagogwa ke dint šwa mo mebileng. Baswi ba rona ba  tshwanetse
go newa tlotlo e e ba tshwanetseng. Re ka se letlelele  ope  go  ikgatholosa
melao ya Puso ya rona.

Puso e e eteletsweng pele ke ANC e  dirile  go  ka  tlala  seatla  go  tlisa
mananeo a a tlaa tlhabololang matshelo a batho botlhe. Ka jalo, ga re  kitla
re tlogela fela gore go senyege re ntse re lebile. Re ile go bua e  bile  ga
re kitla re lapa go dira jalo, ka gonne mosekaphofu ya gaabo ga a tshabe  go
swa lentswe. Rotlhe re a lekana fa pele ga molao, e bile re  tlaa  itumelela
tekatekanyo  eo  ya  ditshwanelo  tsa  botho.   (Translation   of   Setswana
paragraphs follows.)

According to our tradition and chiefs, a human being's bones should  not  be
seen dragged about by dogs in the streets. Our deceased should be given  the
respect that they deserve. We will not allow anybody to ignore the  laws  of
our Government.

This ANC-led Government has done more than enough to bring  programmes  that
will improve the lives of all the people. As such, we are not going  to  sit
back and let things fall apart whilst we watch. We are going to  talk  about
these things, and we will not get tired of  doing  so  because  we  will  be
fighting for what is justifiably ours. We are all equal before the law.  All
of us will be glad for that equality in terms of human rights.]
Our challenge is therefore a speedy resolution to any dispute  about  access
to, and the right to be buried on, the land where one  works.  Farmers  must
respect this piece of legislation unconditionally, without resorting to  the
courts of law.

Farmers must respect the cultures and traditions of  other  sectors  of  the
South African population. Regulations of implementation may include  special
courts  to  settle  disputes  speedily.  A  true  partnership  needs  to  be
established between farmers and farmworkers.  Agri  villages  can  be  built
around farms. This should not be seen by farmers as defiance. Maybe  it  can
solve this crisis. It is important to consolidate the  Land  Reform  (Labour
Tenants) Act and the Extension of Security of Tenure Act.

In conclusion, the courts will be satisfied  that  labour  tenants  who  are
evicted in terms of a temporary order granted because of  urgency,  will  be
assured that adequate arrangements  have  been  made.  All  South  Africans,
including those who have died on farms, have a right to  rest  in  peace  in
their graves with the respect due to them. [Applause.]

Mr D K MALULEKE: Chairperson, Deputy Minister  and  hon  members,  the  Land
Affairs General Amendment  Bill  contains  amendments  to  the  Land  Reform
Labour Tenants Act, Act 3 of 1996, and the Extension of Security  of  Tenure
Act, Act 62 of 1997. Due to the nature of  the  proposed  amendments,  these
are embodied in one Bill. The DP will support this Bill, as  the  amendments
are of a technical nature and seek  uniformity  in  the  provisions  of  the
abovementioned Acts, aligned requirements and dual eviction procedures.

In supporting this  Bill,  the  DP  also  hopes  that  we  will  enable  the
Department of  Land  Affairs  to  speed  up  their  progress  on  issues  of
restitution, redistribution and tenure reform. South Africa's  track  record
in this regard leaves much space for improvement. Dispossession  and  forced
removal of African people under colonialism and apartheid resulted not  only
in the physical separation  of  people  along  racial  lines,  but  also  in
extreme land shortages and insecurity  of  tenure  for  many  of  the  black
population.

With the transition to democracy, expectations were  high  that  an  ANC-led
Government would effect a  fundamental  transformation  of  property  rights
that  would  address  and  lay  the  foundation  for  social  and   economic
upliftment of the rural and urban poor. Such hopes were fuelled by the  1994
Reconstruction and Development Programme, which  included  a  commitment  to
redistributing 30% of agricultural land within five years  and  making  land
reform the central and driving force of a programme of rural development.

However, seven years into the transition, these  issues  are  still  largely
unresolved. Over 30 million people, the majority  of  them  poverty-stricken
people, remain crowded in  rural  areas  where  rights  to  land  are  often
unclear or contested and the system of land administration is in disarray.

On  private  farms,  millions  of  farmworkers,  former  workers  and  their
families face continued tenure  insecurity  and  lack  of  basic  facilities
despite the passing of new laws designed to protect  them.  In  the  cities,
sprawling shack settlements continue to expand, beset by poverty, crime  and
lack of basic services. A deepening social and economic crisis in the  rural
areas,  fuelled  by  falling  formal  sector  employment,  the  ravages   of
HIV/Aids, the collapse  of  agricultural  support  services  in  the  former
homelands, accelerates the movement of people from the deep rural  areas  to
towns and cities throughout the  country,  whilst  thousands  of  retrenched
urban workers make the journey the other  way.  This  results  in  a  highly
diversed pattern for land and  for  a  variety  of  purposes,  and  numerous
hotspots of acute land hunger in both urban and rural areas.

Land reform in South Africa has been pursued  under  three  broad  headings.
These are restitution,  redistribution  and  tenure  reform.  The  aims  and
objectives, as set out in the Constitution of South Africa, the  1997  White
Paper on South African Land Policy  and  a  succession  of  legislation  are
ambitious and potentially far-reaching.  It  also  includes  redressing  the
racial imbalance in land holdings, developing the  agricultural  sector  and
improving the livelihood of the past. However, in line with its  neo-liberal
microeconomic policy, the approach taken by the ANC-led Government has  been
based on respect  for  private  property,  reliance  on  market  mechanisms,
tightly controlled public spending and minimal intervention in the  economy,
which we see  as  unlikely  to  bring  about  transformation  on  the  scale
required.

Since 1994,  whatever  standard  applies,  the  land  reform  programme  has
clearly not succeeded in achieving its  objectives.  Critical  areas  remain
unaddressed. The Department of Land Affairs has routinely  failed  to  spend
its budget. Less than one quarter of 1% of the national  total  resulted  in
reduced funding being made available by the Treasury for  2001-2.  This  has
generally been attributed to a severe  lack  of  capacity,  particularly  in
terms of quantity and quality of staffing in  the  national  and  provincial
offices of the department and the Commission  on  the  Restitution  of  Land
Rights.

The laxity of the Department of Land Affairs  and  the  virtual  silence  of
senior political figures on the land question up to very  recently  suggests
that land reforms have not been a  political  priority  up  to  now.  Poorly
articulated demands among the poor and landless and limited  capacity  among
NGOs in the land sector can also be cited as  factors  contributing  to  the
lack of progress.

All  rural  areas  in  the  Republic  of  South  Africa  fall   within   the
jurisdiction of some district or  local  council  which  should  assume  the
responsibility of  establishing  cemeteries.  It  is  thus  clear  from  the
aforementioned  that  much  still  needs  to  be  done  on  the  issues   of
restitution, redistribution and tenure reform in a  way  that  will  support
reconciliation, reconstruction and development.

It is therefore  with  high  hopes  that  we  look  forward  to  seeing  the
Department of Land Affairs speed up  its  progress  on  these  issues  while
simultaneously addressing poverty in South Africa. [Applause.]

Mr G B BHENGU: Chairperson and hon  members,  we  have  met  to  discuss  an
important milestone in the history of  the  labour  tenants.  They  are  the
people who have experienced severe human abuse in all respects that one  can
contemplate. The sale of their labour has never been a premium on  the  part
of their employer, and they have had  no  choice  in  determining  how  they
should be treated or perceived.

This Bill is introducing a provision that  extends  the  definition  of  the
applicant for the acquisition of land and servitudes.  This  new  definition
will precisely remove the onus from the owner  of  the  land  to  accept  or
reject the successor to a late labour tenant, by introducing a  new  concept
of an associate, as this prerogative has been used to deny the next  of  kin
any right to application for tenancy.

The reduction of the age limit of 65 years of age to  60  years  is  another
important milestone since  people's  body  mechanisms  differ  and  more  so
because of strenuous conditions under which they  work.  Toil  and  becoming
worn out can definitely engulf  them  even  before  they  turn  60.  Working
should, of necessity, be a matter of choice rather than  an  obligation  for
occupying or being allocated land when one has  satisfied  the  requirements
of tenancy through his or her labour as calculated in the working years.

On the issue of evictions, it gives most of us due delight  that  no  person
shall remove or evict  a  labour  tenant  or  an  associate  except  on  the
authority of an order of a competent court. On this score, we  believe  that
there will be no evictions until proceedings  of  the  final  order  by  the
court have taken place. I believe that this court will, in  all  likelihood,
also consider the interests of the tenant facing an eviction.

We welcome the hedging of the advances or subsidies, which the Minister  may
determine and/or grant to the applicants who face eviction and thereby  need
alternative land.  This  means  that  applications  for  such  advances  and
subsidies will cover all applicants prior to 31  March  2001,  as  there  is
little chance that after this date there would have been grievous  evictions
necessitating such applications.

The IFP supports the Bill in its attempt to address the issue of the  burial
of labour tenants. Land, to African communities, is not only  an  abode  but
also a sacrosanct aspect of  our  religion.  Land,  family  and  burial  are
inalienable entities in the African culture. We  appreciate  the  fact  that
this Bill will really illustrate that we not only envy,  but  that  we  have
reached an era of African Renaissance.

The IFP supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Mr Chairperson, I rise to support  this  Bill.  The  Bill  gives
legal effect to the constitutional provisions of  freedom  of  religion  and
worship, and goes a long way towards redressing the imbalances which  became
more apparent and led to a  court  action,  to  which  the  Deputy  Minister
referred. In this country we will have to learn to get  away  from  an  ``us
and them'' approach and develop a ``we'' feeling. In this  context,  I  want
to appeal to farmers that farmworkers  should  be  seen  as  their  extended
family.

The departmental officials  who  implement  the  Extension  of  Security  of
Tenure Act and work  with  it  have  indicated  that  it  is  becoming  more
difficult for farmworkers to  bury  their  dead,  even  in  long-established
gravesites on farms. Many occupants on farms are forced to endure  not  only
the hardships caused by the death of a family  member,  but  the  additional
burden of being forced to find a burial site that is  far  away  from  where
they are living, and that is expensive and contrary to their  religious  and
cultural beliefs.

Some farm owners may genuinely be worried that granting permission  to  bury
on their land will give the family some longer-term right to claim the  land
in the future. However, organised agriculture has often  allayed  the  fears
of these owners, and so they permit burials on their land. Others,  who  are
familiar with the court cases which have been referred to  by  the  hon  the
Minister, see the denial of burials as an  opportunity  to  further  degrade
and humiliate farmworkers, and exert their  power  and  control  over  their
lives during difficult times.

There is a very interesting amendment that  was  brought  in  here,  to  the
effect that any person whose rights or interests have been prejudiced  by  a
contravention of one of the sections of the law  shall  have  the  right  to
institute a private prosecution on the alleged offender.  In  such  a  case,
the provisions of the Criminal Procedure  Act  of  1977  shall  apply  to  a
private  prosecution  in  terms  of  this  Act,  provided  that  the  person
prosecuting privately does so through a person entitled to  practise  as  an
advocate  or  an  attorney  in  the  Republic,  or  the  person  prosecuting
privately has given written notice to the prosecutor  who  has  jurisdiction
over the area, that he or she intends to do so. [Time expired.]

Mr Z KOTWAL: Mr Chairperson, death and burial are  part  of  the  day-to-day
existence in normal society. People make arrangements for their deaths  well
in  advance,  preparing  burial  attire,  expensive  coffins  and   caskets.
However, where is the sense in all this if one does  not  have  a  piece  of
ground to be buried in?

On the farms here in South Africa, people who had no security of tenure  are
now protected by the Extension of Security of  Tenure  Act  and  the  Labour
Tenants Act. They now have security of  tenure.  Landowners  can  no  longer
evict people at every whim and fancy. Our people have the right to  live  on
the land. But, unfortunately, at the moment they do not have  the  right  to
be buried on the land on which they were born and died. With the passing  of
the Land Affairs General Amendment Bill today our people will  now  be  able
to rest in  peace  and  buried  in  the  traditions  and  culture  of  their
forefathers.

bamapulazi babengenelwe ukwesaba bethi sizobathathela amapulazi  abo.  Abazi
ukuthi njengabalandeli bakaKhongolose thina siyayihlonipha imiThetho.

Abanikazi bamapulazi bona  abasihloniphi.  Noma  sesishonile  abasihloniphi,
kanti nemithetho futhi  abayihloniphi.  Ngisho  ngoba  ngaphambi  kokushaywa
kwalemiThetho    esengikhulume    ngayo,    imithetho    ibithule    ngodaba
lokungcwatshwa kwabantu. Kodwa abangani baka-Douglas  Gibson  bayenza  kwaba
sengathi  ithi  kufanele  basivimbe  uma  sifuna  ukungcwaba  abantu  bethu.
Yingakho sabona ukuthi kufanele kube  nomumye  umthetho  ovikela  amalungelo
okungcwaba abantu abashonele epulazini. Lawa malungelo kuthiwa  ngama-burial
rights.

Kula malanga  abantu  basemakhaya  bahlupheka  kakhulu  uma  beshonelwe.  Le
miThetho-ke izosiza. Sesizoba namalungelao okungcwaba. Nokho-ke le  miThetho
ayikaqini  kahle.  Singajabula  uma  umNyango  wezemiHlaba  ungayihlanganisa
lemiThetho:  owokuvikela  abantu  ababesebenza  epulazini  bengaholi  behola
ngokuhlala khona, bebizwa ngama-labour tenants, kanye ne-Security of  Tenure
Act ukuze kube nomthetho owodwa oqinile ovikela abantu abahlali  nabasebenzi
emapulazini. Kunzima ukuhlala endaweni yomunye umuntu. Mayibuye!

Ngaphambili  besitholela  abantu  umhlaba  bese  sibashiya  kanjalo   ukuthi
bazibonele ukuthi  benzenjani.  Lokhu  bekuyiphutha.  Manje,  njengoHulumeni
kaKhongolose  sesinohlelo  lokuthi  kwenziwa   njani   emuva   kokutholakala
komhlaba.  Lolu   hlelo   lubizwa   nge-Land   Redistribution   Agricultural
Development Programme. Kufanele isize ekutheni abantu bethu  bazithuthukise,
balime  ngezindlela  zonke  ukuze  baphile,  babe   ngabalimi   abazozimele,
ekuhambeni kwesikhathi bakhule babe ngabalimi abahwebayo.

Ngithanda ukubonga uNgqongqoshe usisi Thoko Didiza, ongekho lapha,  ngokuthi
bebambisene  noNgqongqoshe  uLekota,  bakwazile   ukuthi   bakhiphe   abantu
baseMabola  emathendeni  lapho  babelahlwe  khona.   Ngomhla   ka-9   Agasti
udadewethu uThoko wabanikeza umhlaba. Halala ngoHulumeni we-ANC, halala!

AMALUNGU: Halala! (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[When I spoke here in the Parliament of South Africa for the first  time,  I
presented my case concerning the way people live in the rural areas.

Before the 1994 elections of grandfather Nelson Mandela, rural  people  were
beaten and their livestock taken from them and they were eventually  evicted
from farms. Farm  owners  used  to  say  that  they  had  a  right  to  land
ownership. The ANC branch in Ntswephe went around collecting  grannies  from
the streets. As branches of the ANC,  we  contacted  members  of  Parliament
here in Cape Town about that problem.

The ANC produced legislation that protects our people. With regard  to  this
legislation we thought we would meet again with farm owners as we  had  been
living with them peacefully. They should not have  been  afraid  or  thought
that we would deprive them of  their  farms.  They  did  not  know  that  as
members of the ANC we respected the law.

Farm owners do not respect us. Even when we are dead, they  do  not  respect
us. They do not respect the  law  either.  Even  before  the  abovementioned
legislation was passed, it did not say anything about the burial  of  people
on farms. The friends of Mr Douglas Gibson made it look as  if  it  said  we
should be prevented from burying  our  people  on  farms.  That  is  why  we
decided to pass another a law, which protects the right to bury  people  who
died on farms. These rights are called burial rights.

These days rural people suffer a lot  when  they  lose  a  loved  one.  This
legislation is going to be helpful. We will  have  burial  rights.  However,
these laws are not so strong.  We  would  be  happy  if  the  Department  of
Agriculture and Land  Affairs  could  combine  these  laws:  This  law  will
protect farm dwellers who receive no payment and are paid by  being  allowed
to stay on farms. These people are called labour tenants.  The  Security  of
Tenure Act should be strong so that  there  will  be  one  strong  law  that
protects people who stay and work on farms. It is very difficult  to  reside
on someone else's land. Africa must come back!

In the past we used to get people land and  then  leave  them.  This  was  a
mistake. Now we as the ANC Government have a plan as to  what  needs  to  be
done after the land has been made available to  people.  This  programme  is
called  the  Land  Redistribution/Agricultural  Development  Programme.   It
should help people to improve themselves so that they can plough, using  all
the methods, and become independent farmers. As time  goes  by,  they  could
become commercial farmers.

I would like to thank hon Minister  Thoko  Didiza,  who  is  not  here,  for
removing the people of Mabola from where they  were  dumped.  She  did  this
together with Minister Lekota. On 9  August  my  sister  Thoko  Didiza  gave
these people land. To the ANC Government we say: Congratulations!

HON MEMBERS: Congratulations!]

Mnr Z KOTWAL: Grondregte was deur die eeue nog  altyd  hoogs  emosioneel  en
het dikwels tot konflik gelei. In Suid-Afrika is dit  ook  nie  anders  nie,
daarom wil ek Agri SA  bedank  vir  hulle  positiewe  benadering  en  begrip
wanneer gepoog word om die onregte  van  die  verlede  reg  te  stel.  Graag
betuig ek ook namens die ANC waardering teenoor die baie boere  wat  gesteld
is op die welsyn van hulle werkers en respek toon vir hul gebruike,  waarvan
die begrawe van hul  geliefdes  maar  een  is.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr Z KOTWAL: Throughout the ages,  land  rights  have  always  been  highly
emotional and often led to conflict. South Africa is no different,  that  is
why I want to thank Agri SA for their positive  approach  and  understanding
when there are attempts to rectify the wrongs of the past. On behalf of  the
ANC I would like to  extend  my  gratitude  to  the  many  farmers  who  are
concerned about the welfare of their workers  and  show  respect  for  their
customs, of which the burial of their loved ones is but one. [Applause.]]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairman, the ACDP will vote in favour  of  the  Land  Affairs
General Amendment Bill because it is right that people should have  security
of tenure, and it is right to protect people from being evicted. It is  also
right to ensure that pensioners are not left homeless and that  people  have
the right to bury their dead.

However, there is a cost involved in all of these things. If  this  cost  is
borne by the farmer alone, it will  ultimately  impact  negatively  on  food
prices. For this reason, there may well be room for the state to  contribute
toward the burden of the landowner, either by  direct  grant  or  reasonable
tax concession, whereby the owner can write off the direct cost  of  housing
people. This would be a positive incentive, which would lessen  the  present
likelihood of unintended  consequences  such  as  farmers  choosing  not  to
accommodate people on their farms and people approaching retirement age  not
being able to find work.

It is also true that farming is a business like every  other  business.  Why
should farmers be forced  to  provide  their  workers  with  what  no  other
business is expected to provide? When these rights are claimed,  the  burden
should be spread fairly, for example where a retiree occupies a dwelling,  a
replacement employee would need a new house. Would the Minister entertain  a
grant to the  owner  to  encourage  the  building  of  new  homes  in  these
instances?
The ACDP believes that  tax  concessions  will  be  a  correct  response  by
Government. Nevertheless, the ACDP supports the Bill.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD:  Voorsitter,  ek  wil  dadelik  begin  om  vir  die  agb
Adjunkminister te sê dat alle mense natuurlik respek het vir die  dood.  Die
dood is ook 'n hoogs emosionele saak. Ek wil vir die agb Adjunkminister  sê:
Hy kom hierso en hy sê dat hy nie eintlik die boere verstaan nie,  want  die
boere het altyd 'n goeie gesindheid gehad. Dit is reg.

Die werklikheid is die boere het bedreig begin voel  oor  sekere  wette  wat
die agb Minister se party  op  die  Wetboek  kom  plaas  het,  waardeur  hul
eiendomsreg bedreig word, deur te sê  dat  daar  sekere  aansprake  gevestig
word op grond deur voorvaders en ander vaders en verdere vaders.

Die werklikheid is dit is hierdie agb  Adjunkminister  se  medepolitici  wat
hierdie saak verpolitiseer het. Kom ek gee u 'n voorbeeld: In Noordwes  gaan
die premier, mnr Popo Molefe, nadat 'n boer wettiglik  volgens  die  hoogste
hof in die land toestemming geweier het en reg opgetree het, waar  hulle  'n
persoon gaan begrawe het in 'n padreserwe,  en hy gaan lê kranse daar en  hy
maak die boere af asof hulle 'n klomp  rassiste  is.  Daardeur,  sê  ek  nou
vandag  vir  die  agb  Adjunkminister,  bevorder  hy  rassehaat.  Dit   word
voorgehou asof die boere  onbillik  is,  onregverdig  is  en  net  eenvoudig
probeer dwars wees en teen die huidige Regering is.

As die agb Adjunkminister wil kom praat oor die  goedgesindheid  van  boere,
moet hy die korrekte feite op die tafel sit. Ek wil ook verder  sê  dat  die
VF die hoofwette wat hierby ter  sprake  is  nie  gesteun  het  nie,  vanweë
verskeie   beginsels,   en   daarom   sal   die   VF   ook    nie    hierdie
wysigingswetsontwerp steun nie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Chairperson, I want to start immediately by telling  the
hon Deputy Minister that of course every person has respect for  death.  The
issue of death is also a highly emotional matter. I want to say to  the  hon
Deputy  Minister:  He  comes  here  and  says  that  he  does  not  actually
understand the farmers, because the farmers  always  had  a  good  attitude.
That is correct.

The reality is that farmers have begun to feel threatened  by  certain  laws
which the hon Minister's party has  placed  on  the  Statute  Book,  whereby
their right of tenure is threatened,  by  saying  that  certain  claims  are
being established on land by  forefathers  and  other  fathers  and  further
fathers.

The reality is that it is this hon Deputy Minister's fellow politicians  who
are politicising this matter. Allow me to give the House an example: In  the
North West the premier, Mr Popo Molefe, went to  where  they  had  buried  a
person in a road reserve after  a  farmer  legally  refused  permission  and
acted rightfully, according to the highest court of the land,  and  he  laid
wreaths there and he made the farmers out to  be  a  bunch  of  racists.  By
doing so, I am now telling the hon Deputy Minister today,  he  is  promoting
racial  hatred.  The  farmers  are  being   presented   as   being   unfair,
unreasonable and simply trying to  be  difficult  and  against  the  present
Government.

If the hon Deputy Minister wants to come and talk about  the  good  will  of
the farmers he should place the right facts on the table.  I  also  want  to
state that the FF did not support the principal Acts at  issue  here,  as  a
result of various principles, and for that reason the FF  will  not  support
this amending Bill either.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act,  Act
3 of 1996, and the Extension of Security  of  Tenure  Act,  1997,  are  both
progressive pieces of legislation. These respective  Acts  seek  to  empower
and protect labour tenants  and  their  associates  by  conferring  on  them
rights and obligations to purchase the land which they occupy and  use  and,
above all, to protect them  from  arbitrary  evictions.  We  all  know  what
necessitated the introduction of the Land Affairs General Amendment Act.

It is common knowledge  that  despite  the  existence  of  these  two  Acts,
farmworkers  and  their  associates  continue  to  be  subjected  to   harsh
treatment  and  real  threats  of  eviction.  Had  it  not  been   for   the
intervention of civil society, organisations active in the  farming  sector,
farmworkers and their loved ones who are unable to render their services  to
their former employers would be  on  the  street  or  their  suffering  left
unattended.

There are even really sad stories of families living on farms  being  denied
an opportunity to bury their loved ones on the farm. It  is  our  view  that
this  proposed  amendment  will  restore  dignity  to  those  affected   and
strengthen  the  respective  Acts  -  giving  them  teeth  -  by  addressing
identified loopholes.

The  UCDP  supports  the  Bill  with  all  its  amendments,  and  views  its
objectives as a positive step in the right  direction  to  ensure  that  the
most productive, yet poor segment of our society, in  the  form  of  current
and former farmworkers, are indeed protected, and  that  they  experience  a
sense of security and ownership of  the  land  they  have  known  all  their
lives, not only as a place of  work,  but  as  their  home.  We,  therefore,
unconditionally support the Bill in its current form.  [Time expired.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, the PAC supports this Bill, believing that  land
belongs to all Africans, and that no African must feel like  a  stranger  in
Africa. We respect the power given  to  the  courts  to  adjudicate  on  the
eviction of people dwelling on land.  Our  one  qualification  is  that  the
problem of landlessness should not be  overlooked.  Many  indigenous  people
simply do not have land. They do not have money to buy  land  and,  even  if
they had money, most of the land has already been bought. Courts  exercising
jurisdiction on evictions should do so with compassion.

The Group Areas Act collapsed when the famous Goldstone decision  was  made.
Judge Goldstone asked a simple question: ``If this family has to  be  moved,
is there a place where they  have  to  be  moved  to?''  This  classic  case
established moral justice in interpreting legal justice. It is worth  noting
that even the apartheid policy was  very  legal,  but  it  was  not  morally
correct. Those who were oppressed defied the legality of it, and  the  whole
world came to declare apartheid  a  crime  against  humanity.  Legality  and
morality are two sides of the same coin.

That  does  not  mean  that  the  rule  of  law  is  subject  to  individual
interpretation and exploitation by opportunists. There must be the  rule  of
law, but equally there must be justice, fairness  and  moral  justification.
The rate of evictions and the hopelessness of the  conditions  of  the  poor
people calls perhaps for the declaration of a moratorium on evictions  until
the ground rules of land redistribution are revisited.

Lately many people have been refused the  right  to  bury  their  dead  with
dignity. The African world-view regards funerals as the ultimate  expression
of one's humanity, Ubuntu, and the place where  one's  final  resting  place
is, is hallowed ground. One cannot be appreciated as  a  source  of  labour,
but be rejected when  one  is  dead.  The  PAC  supports  this  Bill.  [Time
expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, the need to  alter  certain  provisions  of
the Land Reform (Labour Tenants)  Act  and  the  Extension  of  Security  of
Tenure Act is supported. These Acts perform an important role in respect  of
the existing rights of  labour  tenants  and  farm  dwellers  and  are  also
regulating the terms under which these rights may be terminated.

In viewing the amending Bill, the provisions made to alter the  Acts  appear
to be in order. It is, however, noted that the  two  Acts  which  this  Bill
amends are so similar that  the  question  as  to  why  it  was  not  rather
formulated in the Act should be posed. If one focuses  attention  on  clause
5, which provides that the Minister may extend  the  advance  and  subsidies
for the acquisition of land to labour tenants  even  after  they  have  been
legally evicted, and that he may do so  only  if  the  application  for  the
subsidy and or advance was made before 31 March 2001,  this  causes  one  to
wonder how the department intends tracing those labour tenants who had  been
evicted during the apartheid time in order  to  process  their  applications
for subsidies and advances.

However,  the  intentions  of  this  clause  are  positive  and  perhaps  an
announcement  in  the  Gazette  would  cater  for  the  tracing   of   these
farmworkers. The MF applauds the department  on  this  amending  Bill  which
certainly appears to  be  intent  on  achieving  positive  results.  The  MF
supports the Land Affairs General Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, die Adjunkminister het daarna  verwys  dat
daar geskryf staan van die graf van Josef  van  Arimathéa.  Daar  staan  ook
geskryf: ``Die voëls van die hemel het neste; die jakkalse  het  gate,  maar
die Seun van die mens het nie 'n plek waar Hy Sy hoof kan neerlê nie.''

Eers wil ek net 'n baie  belangrike  tegniese  punt  noem.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairman, the Deputy Minister referred  to  the  fact  that
mention was made of the grave of Joseph of Arimathea. It  is  also  written:
``Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of  man  has
nowhere to lay His head.''

At the outset I want to mention a very important technical point.]

The technical point is that the long title of the Bill reads as follows:


  ... to reduce the age at which a labour tenant ... may be evicted ...

The original Act states, and I quote:


  ... a labour tenant who has attained the age of 65  years  shall  not  be
  evicted ...

It should be changed to the age at which he may not be evicted. I  think  we
must ask the NCOP to look at that point.

Die eerste deel gaan oor tegniese  punte  wat  die  twee  wette  met  mekaar
versoen.  Ons  wil  noem  dat  die  AEB  ernstige  probleme  het   met   die
oorspronklike wet. Ons weet dat daar sekere regte van eienaarskap is wat  in
die gedrang kom, en daarom het ons ook probleme  hiermee.  Agri  SA  het  'n
paar probleme genoem wat nie aangespreek is nie.

Formulerings soos ``may not obstruct or interfere'' is baie  moeilik,  veral
in die lig van veiligheidsituasie. Dis baie  vaag.  Net  so  is  ``routinely
gave permission'' in die gedeelte oor  begrafnisse  net  so  moeilik  om  te
vertolk.

Wat die begrafnisse betref, toon die AEB groot begrip en respek vir die  reg
tot die onbelemmerde uitoefening van godsdienstige gebruike,  maar  kan  ons
nie altyd  hierdie  reg  absoluut  handhaaf  nie.  Verabsolutering  van  wat
subjektief as godsdienstige regte beskou word, kan inderdaad, as  die  volle
konsekwensies  daarvan  deurgetrek  word,  lei  tot  die  sanksionering  van
praktyke  soos  die  daggarook  van  Rastafariërs,  genitale  mutilasie   en
onmenslike inisiasiepraktyke.
Ek wil vir die ANC vra: Waarom is die sogenaamde  godsdienstige  regte  hier
van sulke groot belang, maar in die onderwys word die reg van  die  ouer  om
sy kind in dié leer te  laat  onderrig,  misken,  ten  gunste  van  'n  breë
algemene allemansgodsdiens? Gaan dit  werklik  hier  oor  godsdiensregte  of
gaan dit oor grondregte? Ons glo dat hier nie genoeg beskerming is  vir  die
eienaar en dat daar geen ruimte gemaak is vir kostevoorsiening nie.

Ons wil daarom sê dat ons nie hierdie wetswysiging sal kan  steun  nie,  net
soos ons ook besware gehad het teen die oorspronklike wet.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The first part deals with technical points reconciling  the  two  Acts.  We
want to mention that the  AEB  has  serious  problems  with  regard  to  the
original  Act.  We  know  that  certain  rights  of  ownership   are   being
jeopardised  and  therefore  we  also  have  problems  with  that.  Agri  SA
mentioned a few problems which were not addressed.

Phrases such as ``may not obstruct  or  interfere''  are  very  problematic,
especially in the light of the security situation. They are very  vague.  It
is equally difficult to interpret the phrase ``routinely  gave  permission''
in the definition pertaining to funerals.

As far as funerals are concerned, the AEB  has  the  greatest  understanding
and  respect  for  the  right  to   exercise   religious   customs   without
restriction,  but  we  cannot  always  exercise   this   right   absolutely.
Absolutely what we subjectively regard as religious rights  may  indeed,  if
the consequences thereof are taken to their logical conclusion, lead to  the
sanctioning of practises such as  the  smoking  of  dagga  by  Rastafarians,
genital mutilation and inhumane initiation practices.

I want to ask the ANC: Why  are  the  so-called  religious  rights  of  such
importance here, while in education the right of  the  parent  to  have  his
child taught according to this doctrine is  being  denied  in  favour  of  a
broad general religion? Is this really about  religious  rights,  or  is  it
about land rights? We believe that there is not enough protection  here  for
the owner and no provision as regards costs either.

For this reason we want to say that we will not  be  able  to  support  this
statutory amendment, for the same reasons that  we  could  not  support  the
original Act.]

Mr A J BOTHA: Mr Chairperson, it is not often that the DP  has  good  reason
to agree with the Deputy Minister for  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs.  But
today he mentioned a few things here about  which  I  must  certainly  agree
with him. In the first instance, he said that the focus  of  this  amendment
to the Act is burials, and I fully agree with him there.

I think it is necessary for us to realise that the families and  friends  of
every one of us sitting in this House here today,  will  one  day  be  faced
with the need to dispose of our mortal remains at the end of our  lives.  It
is necessary, for our peace of mind, to  be  certain  that  the  trauma  and
disruption caused by death will not be exacerbated by the additional  crisis
regarding the availability of either a burial plot or some other  acceptable
method  of  disposal.  In  an  urbanised  society  most  people   would   be
accommodated in plots specifically set  aside  by  municipalities  for  this
purpose.

In landelike gebiede en op plase is dit egter nog die algemene  gewoonte  om
mense binne bereikbare afstand van die woonplek af te begrawe. Miskien  moet
ek ter illustrasie my eie ondervinding, wat ek glo  vry  algemeen  die  norm
verteenwoordig, met agb lede deel.

Ek is 'n boer en die afstammeling van 11 geslagte boere sedert 1685. My  eie
familie, asook die familie van al die werknemers op die plaas wat die  plaas
met my deel, behou nog grootliks die gewoonte  om  mense  op  die  plaas  te
begrawe.

In die etlike dekades wat ek in beheer van ons familieplaas is, was dit  nog
nooit nodig om spesiale reëlings vir begrafnisse te tref nie.  Dit  word  as
vanselfsprekend aanvaar  en  dit  is  nou  nog  so.  Hier  stem  ek  en  die
Adjunkminister weer met mekaar saam.

Op verskeie plekke het die wetgewing, soos by ESTA, soos die  Adjunkminister
uitgewys  het,  egter  met  onbedoelde  nadraai  die   situasie   aansienlik
verander. Onsekerheid en kommer oor die gevolge  van  grafte  op  plase  het
selfs gelei tot die weiering van plaasbegrafnisse.

Die onlangse appèlhofbeslissing het bepaal dat daar nie so 'n inherente  reg
bestaan nie en daarom debatteer ons vandag dié wysiging. Al  die  partye  in
die portefeuljekomitee het ingestem tot die wysiging wat  daarna  streef  om
meer sekerheid oor gevestigde gebruike te verskaf.

Sommige van die partye wat vandag teen die  wysigingswetsontwerp  stem,  was
nooit by een van dié portefeuljevergaderings nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]  Dit  is
van die uiterste belang om daarop te let dat die  regsgeding  veroorsaak  is
deur 'n uitsonderlike ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In rural areas and on farms it is, however, still common practice  to  bury
people within accessible distance from the home. Perhaps I should  share  my
own experience, by way of illustration, with hon members,  which  I  believe
commonly represents the norm.

I am a farmer and the descendant of 11 generations of  farmers  since  1685.
My own family, as well as the family of all the employees on  the  farm  who
share the farm with me, still to a  large  extent  retain  the  practice  of
burying people on the farm.

In the many decades I have been in control of our family farm it  has  never
been necessary to make special arrangements for funerals. It is accepted  as
a matter of course and it is still like this. Here I once again  agree  with
the Deputy Minister.

At various places the legislation has, however, as at ESTA,  as  the  Deputy
Minister  pointed  out,  with  unintentional  after  effects,  changed   the
situation considerably. Uncertainty and concern about  the  consequences  of
graves on farms has even led to the refusal of farm funerals.

The recent Appeal Court  ruling  determined  that  no  such  inherent  right
exists and for that reason we are debating this  amendment  today.  All  the
parties in the portfolio committee agreed to the amendment which strives  to
provide more certainty on established practices.

Some of the parties who are voting against the amending Bill today, did  not
even attend one of the portfolio meetings. [Interjections.]  It  is  of  the
utmost importance to note that this court case was caused by an  exceptional
...]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Order!  Hon  member,  are  you
rising on a point of order?

Dr P W A MULDER: Voorsitter, is die agb lid bereid  om  'n  baie  eenvoudige
vraag te beantwoord?

Mnr A J BOTHA: Nee, ek  is  nie,  baie  dankie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)
[Dr P W A MULDER: Chairperson, is the hon member prepared to answer  a  very
simple question?

Mr A J BOTHA: No, I am not, thank you very much.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! No, he is not.

Mnr A J BOTHA: Dit is van die uiterste belang  om  daarop  te  let  dat  die
regsgeding veroorsaak is deur 'n uitsondering op die reël en  nie  die  reël
nie.

Dit is nie die boodskap wat na buite uitgedra word nie. Ek  is  bevrees  dat
die agb Kasienyane, maar veral die agb Kotwal, hulself weer  vandag  hieraan
skuldig gemaak het. Soos dikwels vantevore is die beeld  na  buite  een  van
rassistiese boere wat andere se regte misken.

Só  erg  het  dit  onlangs   op   die   SABC   gegaan   dat   Agri-SA,   die
sambreelorganisasie  van  kommersiële  boere,  'n  amptelike  klag   hieroor
ingedien het. Agb lede  moet  ter  wille  van  perspektief  daarop  let  dat
president  Mbeki  dié  organisasie  gereeld  aanprys  vir  sy  positiewe  en
ewewigtige benadering. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A J BOTHA: It is of the utmost importance to note that this  court  case
was caused by an exception to the rule and not the rule.

That is not the message being conveyed outside. I am  afraid  that  the  hon
Kasienyane, but especially the hon Kotwal, have once again  made  themselves
guilty of this today. As  has  happened,  many  times  before,    the  image
conveyed is that of racist farmers who disregard the rights of others.

It  went  so  badly  recently  on  the  SABC  that  Agri  SA,  the  umbrella
organisation of commercial  farmers,  submitted  an  official  complaint  on
this. For the sake of perspective hon members  should  note  that  President
Mbeki regularly  praises  this  organisation  for  its  positive  and  well-
balanced approach.]

Yesterday the President, in reply to a question,  appealed  for  enhancement
of common loyalty  to  South  Africa  by,  amongst  others,  respecting  the
cultures, beliefs and basic rights of others. I appeal, in like  manner,  to
all of us here today, in judging our fellow South Africans  in  the  farming
community, to do the same. The hon Kotwal  should  consider  the  effect  on
human lives of ill-considered generalisations.  Consider  the  economic  and
social impact of ill-considered generalisations is what I would like to  say
to the hon Kasienyane. When these hon members have  considered  these,  then
they  should  consider  assisting  an  already  traumatised  sector  of  our
society, rather than impeding progress with total negativity. [Applause.]

Mr M A MAPHALALA: Chairperson and hon members, we are debating today a  very
important piece of legislation that concerns the  lives  of  our  people  in
this country.  This  legislation  is  not  more  important  than  any  other
legislation, but very important. It is important in  that  we  are  debating
about a section in our society that, in the history  of  this  country,  was
neglected - this is the section of the population in our society that  lives
on the farms, on land that is owned by other people.
It pains one to sit here and listen to people who make a joke  out  of  this
issue that we are discussing today, as  if  they  are  living  on  a  planet
somewhere outside this country. We have experienced people  running  up  and
down along the road, trying to find a place where they can bury their  dead.
For the first time, today, we are debating a Bill that grants the  right  to
such people to bury their dead with dignity in a place they  would  be  able
to visit in the future.

Yesterday, before coming to this debate, there was  a  question  on  whether
this Bill would allow people to visit the graves of their relatives who  had
been buried on a certain farm. The answer is: Yes, people will  be  able  to
do so for the  first  time.  Our  Comrade  President  once  said  that  this
Government was about the people, and that it was for the  people,  and  this
demonstrates precisely that.

The hon Groenewald seems to be worried about farmers that fear that if  such
rights are granted, they will lose their property rights.  I  do  not  think
that is correct. I do not think that is true. I think his party is  probably
representing those few farmers that are arrogant and  inhumane,  those  that
treat our people as animals. [Interjections.]

There  is  an  organisation  that  represents  farmers:  Agri     SA.   This
organisation supports  this  Bill,  and  this  organisation  represents  the
majority of farmers.  That  majority  of  farmers  are  saying:  Yes,  those
workers must  be  granted  the  right.  I  do  not  know  which  farmers  he
represents then. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Secondly, Mr Groenewald does not even know on which  day  the  Committee  on
Agriculture and Land Affairs sits.

Mr P J GROENEWALD: You are quite right!

Mr M A MAPHALALA: He does not attend those meetings, so  he  does  not  even
know the Bill that we are talking about. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order!
Dr C P MULDER: Chairperson, on a point of order: This is the second  speaker
who is  misleading  Parliament  by  making  those  pronouncements.  Are  the
members not aware of the fact that the smaller opposition  parties  are  not
allowed to be members of all committees? Because  they  do  not  know  that,
they make these pronouncements  and  they  are  misleading  the  public  and
Parliament. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! It is strictly speaking  not  a
point of order, but I think it is valid nonetheless  for  small  parties  to
make their viewpoint known so that it is not miscommunicated to  the  nation
at large.

Mr M A MAPHALALA: Chairperson, if I had time I  would  have  addressed  this
issue, that  if  parties  are  not  able  to  attend,  they  must  not  make
pronouncements on issues that they are not familiar with and  that  they  do
not understand. [Applause.]

I have experience of this problem that we are discussing today, and  I  want
to thank the ANC Government that they have considered that  if  we  say  all
people must be treated equally, that is what we must do in this  Parliament.
We must really make those people who are suffering out there feel that  they
enjoy their part of this South Africa, that they enjoy these  freedoms  that
we  are  talking  about  today,  otherwise  we  cannot  talk  of   freedoms.
[Applause.]

Citizens of all countries talk about freedom when they have the  freedom  to
have a right to the piece of land they reside on. We talk  of  freedom  when
people are able to bury their dead, we talk of freedom when people  who  are
living on the land are able to farm that particular land.

This legislation, in my view, is not just a technical amendment.  It  is  an
amendment which brings about fundamental rights for our people.  Our  people
will be able to visit those lands, and will be able to live on  them.  If  a
person is evicted from the land, for the first time the court will  be  able
to order reinstatement of that person back on land if the eviction  was  not
correct.  It  is  fundamental,  is   not   just   a   technical   amendment.
[Interjections.]

Ms N M TSHEOLE: Chairperson, on a point of order: I would like to ask if  it
is parliamentary for the  hon  members  to  chew  and  eat  peanuts  in  the
Chamber? [Interjections.] I see their jaws moving up and  down  like  goats.
[Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members  you  may  bring
neither drinks nor food into the House. Proceed, hon member.

Mr M A MAPHALALA: Chairperson, unfortunately the hon  Aucamp  says  he  does
not understand why the ANC treasure  so  much  the  cultural  and  religious
rights of people to bury their dead. I do not know where he  comes  from.  I
respected him and thought that he knew the cultures  of  people.  He  should
know that we bury people according to our cultures,  and  the  ANC  respects
that. The ANC respects those rights of people to bury  their  dead  the  way
they believe in and, therefore, the ANC believes that they  have  the  right
to visit those graves and to keep them in good order.

Unfortunately my friend  Maluleke,  Ndabezitha,  I  cannot  understand  what
happened. I thought we are moving together, we attended the meetings of  the
portfolio committee and we understood. I do not know  whether  hon  Maluleke
went to the dictionary and the Internet and borrowed   words  that  he  does
not understand.

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Somebody else wrote his speech.

Mr M A MAPHALALA: Chairperson, it is one issue that gives me a problem  with
what hon Maluleke  was  saying.  The  rest  was  very  good.  He  personally
understands the plight that our people are going through. But, he is  saying
the ANC has a neoliberal programme. I do not know that if we are  saying  we
are granting our people from the farms the right to bury, to  residence  and
to visit their dead if he identifies that as neoliberal, then I do not  know
if he knows what is neoliberal.

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Somebody else wrote his speech.

Mr M A MAPHALALA: Chairperson, I do not know, because  he  knows  very  well
that this department is working on the consolidation of two Acts,  ESTA  and
the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act, to grant  permanent  rights.  We  know
that this piece of legislation is a stopgap Bill, to make  sure  that  there
are no people who are lying on the street dead, that people are buried,  and
he is saying that it is neoliberal. I do not  know  whether  he  knows  what
neoliberal is. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  let  me
just thank Mr Maphalala for his very wise address here. Indeed, it  is  only
the first five clauses of the Bill  that  are  really  technical.  Substance
lies in the rest.

What this Bill addresses is actually a coming together of a lot of  distress
factors in South African society. I  think  that  has  been  illustrated  by
members in their speeches and we thank them for it. It is on  the  balancing
line between a lot of stress points in South Africa. One can see  the  whole
of South African history in this burial problem which we have. One  can  see
it is grounded in the landlessness, as the members have exhibited,  that  is
the root of the problem of people being driven off the  land  systematically
over more than 350 years. That is at the heart of the  problem.  So,  if  we
really want to get it right we must get that  right.  That  is  why  we  are
working with legislation at the moment, but to achieve land reform, to  have
the land situation addressed, that is what in the end  we  will  be  working
on.

The second factor is that one sees people who are  socioeconomically  in  an
extremely poor position. The rural workers in South Africa are  amongst  the
poorest of this country. They are poorer and less educated than  the  people
in the traditional areas, in the old tribal areas. They are  far  less  well
off than them.

One actually sees  the  result  of  a  working  proletariat  that  has  been
systematically created over 350 years.  [Interjections.]  That  is  why  the
people have a problem with their burials. It is because they are sitting  in
a position that has  been  structurally  created.  We  are  sitting  with  a
historical and systematical result. [Interjections.]

Today we have seen the attitude, which was so tragically demonstrated by  Mr
Groenewald, of the landlord - the lord of all he  surveys.  [Interjections.]
This domination is oriented to landownership. [Interjections.] That is  what
he demonstrated and I will talk more about that. [Interjections.]

Today, we are seeing here a degrading of other religions and  cultures  that
lies at the heart of the burial problem which we have in  South  Africa.  We
have seen what I believe to be the core of the problem. People can say  what
they want, but it is the problem of nonrespect for people  of  other  races.
[Interjections.] Somehow they think their land will  be  soiled  if  someone
from another race is buried on that land.  That  is  at  the  heart  of  the
problem and I maintain it. [Interjections.] We are not talking  about  these
hon members, but we are talking about the people.

What I heard when the hon member Groenewald was talking  was  that  he  used
words I have heard before when he said:

``Hierdie mense wat hulle  vaders  en  voorvaders  en  agtervaders  wil  kom
begrawe.'' [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is dieselfde klank wat  ek  hoor  by  mense
wat sê: ``O, dis alweer die swartmense wat begrafnisse wil hou  en  uit  die
werk uit wil wegbly.'' Dit is 'n rassistiese houding daardie,  wat  uitgewis
moet word in hierdie land. Die mense wat kla  oor  wat  Popo  Molefe  gedoen
het, sal hulle napraat. Hulle is presies nou waar  hulle  was.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[``These people who want to come and bury their fathers and forefathers  and
`afterfathers'''. [Interjections.] This is the same tone I hear from  people
saying: ``Oh, it is once again the black people who want  to  have  funerals
and stay  away  from  work.''  This  is  a  racist  attitude  that  must  be
eradicated in this country.  Those  people  who  complain  about  what  Popo
Molefe has done will echo this. They are now exactly where they were.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Yes,  hon  member,  are  you
rising on a point of order?

Dr C P MULDER: Mr Chairperson, I am rising on a point of order, so that  the
Deputy Minister can get calm and collected.  The  hon  the  Deputy  Minister
clearly referred to the hon member  Mr  Groenewald  now  when  he  made  the
statement that he made and he inferred that it was racist. Now,  I  want  to
know if it is in order that the Deputy Minister implies that the  statements
that were made by the hon member are racist or  not,  and  the  implications
that he is a racist, because he denies that very strongly. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, are you  rising  on
the same point of order?

Ms N E HANGANA: Mr Chairperson, yes, I  am  rising  on  the  same  point  of
order. I do not think that the hon the Deputy Minister mentioned a  name.  I
do not think it is so. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Dr Mulder, to the  best  of
my knowledge, I think the  Deputy  Minister  has  been  talking  in  general
terms. [Interjections.] [Applause.] He has not specifically alluded  to  the
fact that what the particular member said was racist.  But  in  the  broader
context of the debate, I think, he is well within his rights to be  able  to
make critical comments in that  regard.  [Interjections.]  If  you  are  not
happy with that, then I  will  pursue  the  matter  further  and  study  the
Hansard. [Interjections.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mr Chairperson, I want to  address  you  on  your  ruling.  I
request you to have a  look  at  the  Hansard,  because,  as  far  as  I  am
concerned, the Minister referred to the hon member and said that those  were
racist points of view. I would ask you to look at the  Hansard  and  make  a
ruling at a better time. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, and I will look at that.

Die ADJUNKMINISTER: Wat my hinder en waarom  dit  sulke  skandalige  optrede
was, is dat dit kom van mense wat kulturele regte probeer dryf as die  basis
vir hul politiek. Hulle ontsê mense hul  eie  kulturele  regte  en  het  nie
waardering vir die diepte van gevoel wat  daar  rondom  begrafnisse  in  ons
kulture in Suid-Afrika bestaan nie. Ek  dink  dit  is  skandalig.  Wat  word
gedoen? Daar word staat gemaak op die formele regsposisie.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Voorsitter, ek kan my stem verhef, so die Huis kan  maar
raas. Ek wil vir die agb Adjunkminister vra of hy bereid is om 'n  vraag  te
beantwoord. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die mense raas so dat ek nie kan hoor wat  die
agb Adjunkminister sê nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The  DEPUTY  MINISTER:  What  does  concern  me,  and  why  this  was  such
scandalous behaviour, is that it comes from people  who  are  attempting  to
drive cultural rights as the basis  of  their  politics.  They  deny  people
their own cultural rights and they do not  have  any  appreciation  for  the
depth of emotions that exist in relation to burials in our culture in  South
Africa. I think this is scandalous. What is being done? People  are  relying
on the formal legal position.

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Chairperson, I can raise  my  voice,  so  the  House  can
continue making a noise. I would like to ask the  hon  the  Deputy  Minister
whether he is prepared to take a question. [Interjections.] The  people  are
making such a noise that I cannot hear what the hon the Deputy  Minister  is
saying.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER: No, I am not willing to take a question.

Van sulke mense neem ek nie vrae nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Nou word daar  staat
gemaak op die formele regsposisie waarom mense  in  die  padreserwe  begrawe
moes word. Nou is die formele regsposisie verander  vir  daardie  soort  van
mense. Ons praat nie van mense van wie ons met waardering kennis  neem  nie.
Dit is die oorgrote meerderheid van boere  in  hierdie  land,  wat  nie  die
houding het wat mnr Botha vandag hier geopenbaar het nie.

Ons het vandag absolute morele bankrotskap gesien  van  'n  party  wat  geen
steun meer het in hierdie land nie, en wat vernietig  sal  word.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I do not take questions from such people. [Interjections.] Now  people  are
relying on the formal legal position as to why  people  must  be  buried  in
road reserves. Now the formal legal position  has  been  changed  for  those
kinds of people. We are not talking about people of whom we take  note  with
appreciation. That is the overwhelming majority of farmers in  this  country
who do not have the attitude that Mr Botha demonstrated here today.

Today we saw the absolute moral bankruptcy of a party  that  no  longer  has
any support in this country, and that will be destroyed. [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a  second  time  (Freedom  Front  and  Afrikaner  Eenheidsbeweging

          VETERINARY AND PARA-VETERINARY PROFESSIONS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Chairperson,  now  you
see the animal-loving soft guy here again before you. [Interjections.]  This
very interesting Bill, I must say, unfortunately took a very  long  time  to
get here. I am sure the hon Mr Hanekom is very glad to  see  it  here  today
after a long consultative process.

This Bill makes  provision  for  the  establishment  of  the  SA  Veterinary
Council. The objectives of this council are to regulate  the  practising  of
veterinary and para-veterinary professions and to  advise  the  Minister  on
matters affecting these professions. What it does, is to propose  amendments
to the  present  constitutional  structure  of  the  veterinary  council  to
ensure, firstly, that  this  important  council  is  representative  of  the
demographics of the country.

There is  a  public  duty  on  the  Minister  to  inform  the  parliamentary
committees in writing about the  designation  or  election  of  the  members
concerned, so that the information is passed on and so that  the  committees
can exercise  their  duties  of  keeping  the  Ministry  and  the  executive
accountable.  The  veterinarians  who  now  want  to  practise  in   private
companies, as is the practice in some other professions,  will  be  provided
for in this Bill. The reason why this  relook  at  the  Act  came  about  is
because the council was no longer in conformity with present-day  provisions
and requirements.

Secondly, we had a constitutional problem in that the Act was  not  in  line
with  the  principles  of  the  new  Constitution.  A  working   group   was
established  and  a  long  process  followed.  Workshops   were   conducted,
stakeholders were consulted and written submissions were received.
As long ago as June 1995, a workshop on the  restructuring  of  the  council
was held. Concerns were raised and the restructuring of the present  council
started. It was then requested that the Act be amended. Today  we  have  the
result of that process.

In terms of the amendments made to section 6 of the present  Act,  a  person
will not qualify to be a member of this council if he  is  found  guilty  of
unprofessional, improper or disgraceful conduct - all the  usual  provisions
that we have for this type of professional council.

What is interesting is that the original Act stipulated  that  a  member  of
the council should be proficient in  both  the  former  official  languages,
that is, in both English and Afrikaans. That  is  unconstitutional.  By  the
way, I wonder how many Acts in South Africa  are  unconstitutional  on  this
ground, requiring, for some purpose, that one must  be  proficient  in  both
those official languages, meaning English and Afrikaans. We  should  have  a
general amending Bill which will amend all these Acts in one go.

The history of this provision in the  Bill  is  interesting.  The  executive
included the provision that such a person should be proficient in  at  least
two of the official languages, of which English  should  be  one.  That  was
rejected.

It is a very interesting point and  I  think  the  committee  was  right  to
reject it. The Bill cannot require such a person  to  be  proficient  in  at
least two of the official languages,  stipulating  that  English  should  be
one, because that is discrimination.

The best qualified person should be appointed as a member of  this  council.
If such a person speaks only Afrikaans and Zulu,  he  should  be  appointed,
and not because he might also speak English.  I  think  this  is  completely
correct. We should make other plans. If one member  of  the  council  speaks
Afrikaans and Zulu and  the  other  people  speak  English,  an  interpreter
should be provided. That is the only way to get  equality  of  languages  in
this country and we should stand firm on that. This matter has  now  created
a precedent which I hope is correct. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

I want to thank the committee for their excellent work  in  this  regard  as
well as in general.

The   MINISTER   OF   HOME   AFFAIRS:   Sihlalo,   uqinisile   uNgqongqoshe.
[Chairperson, the hon the Minister is right.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Thank you, Nkosi.

The amendment of section 20 deals with the qualifications for  registration.
The possibilities for registration are broadened for  specialist  veterinary
professions. The council may require the candidate to write  an  examination
on top of a degree or diploma.

The amendment to section 24 requires the registration of private  companies,
that is veterinarians who practise as private companies.

The disciplinary powers of the council  are  clearly  described.  Previously
fines for misconduct were very low. We amended the  Bill  in  terms  of  the
Adjustment  of  Fines  Act,  1991.  Henceforth  fines  will  be   determined
according to the provisions of that Act and will be adjusted automatically.

It is important to note that section 29 of the Pharmacy Act, 1974,  is  also
amended. Gaps occurred in existing legislation and  veterinarians  were  not
allowed to sell  medicine  like  doctors,  pharmacists,  dentists  or  other
practitioners. This Bill also amends the  Pharmacy  Act.  Veterinarians  can
now supply medicine to their clients. They have been  brought  to  the  same
level  as  other  medical  practitioners  and  dentists.   [Time   expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr B A RADEBE: Chairperson and hon members, once again we  meet  during  the
month of red October to advance the transformation  agenda  of  the  ANC-led
Government. All professions in this  country  were  organised  along  racial
lines and according to  apartheid  policies.  That  is  why  the  legacy  of
apartheid is still with us today.

According to the  latest  statistics,  there  are  about  2  227  veterinary
surgeons in the country and only 98 of them are of African  origin.  Out  of
this total, only 23 are in the employment of the Department  of  Agriculture
and Land Affairs, the very department which is charged with ensuring  animal
health in the country. It is the duty of the Ministry  and  the  council  to
ensure that this anomaly of apartheid is addressed. With  these  amendments,
we as the ANC believe that the council is in a better position to  transform
the  profession  by  ensuring  that  it  is  represented  according  to  the
demographics of our country. This action must  also  attain  gender  equity,
which is guaranteed by our Constitution.

The Freedom Charter made a clarion call  that  the  doors  of  learning  and
culture shall be opened to all South Africans. According to  statistics,  in
1994, 136 first-year students enrolled for veterinary  science.  The  number
steadily declined to 79 in 2001. This is  cause  for  concern.  One  of  the
objects of the council is to determine the minimum standard of  tuition  and
training required for  degrees,  diplomas  and  certificates  entitling  the
holders to be registered to  practise  the  veterinary  and  para-veterinary
professions.

The members of the council who  represent  universities  must  clearly  come
forward and explain why we have this situation. If we do not invest  in  our
youth through training and education, the future of our country  is  doomed.
Since universities  are  sites  where  professionals  are  prepared,  it  is
important that universities should provide incentives to draw students  from
previously disadvantaged communities to study veterinary science. This  must
take the form of study tours to the faculties of veterinary science and  the
provision of scholarships to students who have potential.  This  will  go  a
long way towards realising the objectives of the RDP.
The ANC made a call that we must speed up change and provide a  better  life
for all. One way of providing a better  life  for  all  is  to  give  people
freedom to practise their professions  under  conditions  of  stability  and
certainty. We appreciate that  this  amendment  recognises  the  specialised
fields within the para-veterinary profession. This will lead to an  increase
in the number of paravets in the  council  from  one  to  three.  This  will
enable them to express their opinions and lobby their needs in the  council.
This will help stem the tide of professionals leaving our country.

In this profession we must appreciate that there are lots  of  patriots.  It
is one of the  professions  where  there  is  a  smaller  number  of  people
emigrating to other countries. An  example  is  that  in  1994,  only  eight
veterinarians emigrated,  in  1996  only  four  emigrated  and  in  1998  no
veterinarians emigrated. This confirms what President  Mbeki  said  in  this
House, that as a nation, we are on course.

The way the veterinarians handled the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak was  a
shining example of a nation at work. Within a period  of  five  months,  the
disease  was  eliminated  from  the  province   of   KwaZulu-Natal,   whilst
veterinarians from different parts of the country  converged  to  fight  the
disease. The knowledge gained from this  experience  of  fighting  foot-and-
mouth disease must be shared with the people of Zimbabwe, where the  disease
has struck again. This will go a long way towards fostering  neighbourliness
in the context of the African Renaissance.

Mr G B BHENGU: Chairperson and hon members,  the  amending  Bill  before  us
today addresses a number of issues that have  affected  the  veterinary  and
para-veterinary professions.

Unfortunately, the way in which such issues have affected these  professions
happens to simultaneously affect human beings. Professions are  about  human
beings. No animal can practise a profession, and therefore it  cannot  be  a
professional.
The constitution of the  SA  Veterinary  Council  will  change  face,  since
university  representatives  will  now  be  ``from''  rather   than   ``of''
universities. These representatives will, by that  very  fact,  act  in  the
interests of the profession over and above that of a university.

We are happy that the recognition of only  two  official  languages,  namely
Afrikaans and English, has  been  done  away  with.  That  very  clause  has
alienated the majority of our  people  and  prevented  them  from  accessing
strategic positions in the job market. On the issue of  the  racial  divide,
one can also point out that all institutions offering courses in  veterinary
and para-veterinary professions will, as a result of this amendment,  be  on
a par with each other, irrespective of the majority of  students  registered
for these courses.

It gives us great pleasure to learn that a representative council  will,  in
the near future, undertake the registration of the qualified  veterinarians.
This council will set standardised examinations that will  entrench  similar
standards countrywide. We believe that the facilities  and  other  resources
will not disadvantage students from previously  disadvantaged  institutions,
because that loophole will  bring  another  institutionalisation  of  racial
discrimination.

The requirement that the Minister will  have  to  inform  the  parliamentary
committee in writing about  the  election  or  designation  of  the  council
within 30 days of election or designation renders the  constitution  of  the
council a transparent process. We hope that  the  Minister's  obligation  to
consult with the outgoing board  regarding  the  selection  panel  will  not
jeopardise, but inform the constitution process.

We are concerned about the salary structure of  the  veterinary  profession,
as  it  is  not  on  a  par  with  that  of  the  medical  profession.   The
dissimilarity  of  patients  treated  by  these   professions   should   not
necessarily be used to discriminate against dispensers of certain  services,
for example veterinary  and  para-veterinary  services.  Let  us  strive  to
enhance the dignity of these  professionals  who  render  a  very  essential
service. Veterinarians and para-veterinarians take  care  of  our  livestock
and pets as if they were looking after human beings.

One of the main factors that attract people to a  particular  profession  is
the pay structure. Why should this kind of science be looked down upon  when
it comes to financial incentives, especially when we have  an  urge  to  arm
our human resources potential with skills in  the  science,  technology  and
commercial fields? Let us correct  this  imbalance  for  the  sake  of  this
necessary profession.

The IFP supports the amending Bill.

Mnr A S VAN DER MERWE: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Adjunkminister  en  kollegas,
ek dink ek en die vorige spreker sal  'n  goeie  span  kan  vorm,  want  ons
koester dieselfde gedagtes oor hierdie professie.

Die  doel  van  die   wetsontwerp   is   om   die   samestelling   van   die
veeartsenykundige raad duidelik  uit  te  spel,  met  die  nodige  ingeboude
maatreëls om vertragings in die aanstelling van die raad in die  toekoms  te
voorkom. Dit is van die uiterste belang dat geen  vertragings  voorkom  nie,
aangesien dit die werksaamhede van  die  raad  en  die  bedryf  saboteer  en
nadelige gevolge vir die veebedryf van die land inhou.

Die vertragings in die aanstelling van die lede  van  die  raad  is  in  die
verlede  hoofsaaklik  toegeskryf  aan  die  Departement   van   Landbou   se
agterlosigheid om nie betyds en vroegtydig hulle reg om te nomineer  uit  te
oefen nie. Vertragings van hierdie aard kan ernstige gevolge  vir  ons  land
inhou, soos  byvoorbeeld  dat  veeartse  van  ander  lande  met  onvoldoende
kwalifikasies  hier  kan  praktiseer.   Hierdie   ongewenste   praktyk   kan
ongestoord  voortgaan,  tot  nadeel  van  die  land,  indien  ons  raad  nie
funksioneer nie. Hierdie veeartse mag wel deeglik  opgelei  wees,  maar  die
opleiding is dalk nie geskik vir omstandighede  in  Suid-Afrika  met  unieke
tropiese siektes nie. Daarom  moet  hierdie  veeartse  getoets  word  en  in
sekere gebiede van veeartsenykunde heropgelei  word.  Daarom  mag  daar  dus
geen vertragings met die aanstel van die raad wees nie.

Hierdie  stuk  wetgewing  is  die  resultaat  van  kompromieë   tussen   die
departement,  veeartse  en  'n  groot  verskeidenheid  tersake   instansies.
Hierdie  wetsontwerp  skryf  presies  voor  hoe  die  lys  van  persone  ...
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A S VAN DER MERWE: Mr Chairman, hon Deputy Minister  and  colleagues,  I
think the previous speaker and I would make a good  team,  because  we  have
the same ideas about this profession.

The objective of the Bill is to expound the composition  of  the  veterinary
council clearly, with the necessary built-in measures to prevent  delays  in
appointing the council in the future. It is of the  utmost  importance  that
there should be no delays, as this sabotages the activities of  the  council
and has detrimental consequences for the livestock industry.

In the past delays in appointing the members of the council  were  primarily
ascribed to the Department of Agriculture's failure to exercise their  right
to make nominations on time and timeously. Delays of this nature could  have
serious consequences for our country, for example  that  veterinarians  from
other countries who have  inadequate  qualifications  could  practise  here.
This undesirable practice could continue unchanged to the detriment  of  the
country if our council is not  functioning.  These  veterinarians  may  very
well be thoroughly trained, but the training may perhaps not be suitable  to
the conditions in South Africa, which has unique tropical diseases. That  is
why these veterinarians should be tested and retrained in certain  areas  of
veterinary science. There may therefore be no delays in the  appointment  of
the council.

This  piece  of  legislation  is  the  result  of  compromises  between  the
department,  veterinary  surgeons  and   a   large   variety   of   relevant
institutions. This Bill prescribes exactly  how  the  list  of  persons  ...
[Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members who  are  occupying
the far back benches,  you  are  carrying  on  with  your  own  parliaments.
Please, do pay attention.

Mnr A S VAN DER MERWE: Hierdie wetsontwerp skryf presies voor  hoe  die  lys
van persone wat aan die Minister voorgelê moet  word,  opgestel  moet  word.
Die portefeuljekomitee het, as gevolg van die vertraging met nominasies  vir
die raad en  dus  aanstellings  wat  daarop  moet  volg,  aangedring  op  'n
klousule wat die Minister verantwoordelik maak, sodat  die  Departement  van
Landbou tydig en skriftelik terugvoering sal gee aan die  portefeuljekomitee
oor bedankings en aanstellings binne 30 dae nadat dit gedoen is.

Die portefeuljekomitee was ook van mening dat  'n  wetsontwerp  van  redelik
eenvoudige aard soos hierdie een te lank geneem  het  om  af  te  handel  as
gevolg van  swak  kontinuïteit  en  voorleggingsessies  deur  die  staat  se
regsadviseurs. Ek versoek dat hierdie probleem in  die  toekoms  uitgeskakel
moet word.
Die komitee was ook van mening dat daar 'n groot  behoefte  bestaan  om  die
industrie te  transformeer  deur  'n  groter  verskeidenheid  mense  na  die
veeartsenykundige veld te trek. Hoewel die wetsontwerp  'n  basis  daarstel,
sal alles niks help indien die agb Minister  nie  daadwerklik  aan  'n  hele
paar knelpunte aandag skenk nie.

Die eerste  hiervan  is  finansiering.  Finansiering  van  veeartsenykundige
dienste is glad nie voldoende nie. Ek wil nie graag my betoog laat berus  op
verwyte nie. Vir 'n hele  paar  jaar  pleit  die  opposisie  vir  genoegsame
fondse vir byvoorbeeld  die  Landbounavorsingsraad.  Jaar  na  jaar  is  die
pleidooie  afgewys.  Ons  voorganger  het  met  trots  en  met  reg  na  die
transformasieproses verwys. Dit kan  nie  die  plek  inneem  van  genoegsame
fondse nie.

Nou het die Ouditeur-generaal  in  sy  ouditeursverslag  gewaarsku  dat  die
Landbounavorsingsraad se werksaamhede besig is  om  in  duie  te  stort,  as
gevolg  van  'n  gebrek  aan   fondse.   Ek   versoek   dringend   dat   die
veeartsenykundige dienste en  navorsing  asseblief  nie  as  gevolg  van  'n
gebrek aan fondse dieselfde pad as die Landbounavorsingsraad  loop  nie.  'n
Land wat sy navorsing laat agterraak, sal ook  nie  ekonomies  lewensvatbaar
kan voortbestaan nie.

Ek vra myself af hoekom 25% van veeartsposte in die land nie gevul  is  nie.
Is dit omdat salarisse nie voldoende is nie? Is  dit  omdat  poste  oopgehou
word vir transformasie? Indien ek reg is dat die  poste  oopgehou  word  vir
transformasie, moet die agb Minister haarself afvra wat die probleem is.

Ek is van mening dat nuwe opkomende veeartse die beroep sien  as  'n  beroep
wat nie die nodige status het nie.  Indien  my  aanvoeling  reg  is,  is  'n
dringende veldtog nodig om hierdie verkeerde persepsie die nek in te  slaan.
Is daar waarheid in die gerug dat daar werklose swart veeartse  is  wat  nie
aanstelling by die departement kry nie, terwyl 25% van die poste  nie  gevul
is nie?

Hierdie wetsontwerp, as basis, sal sy waarde totaal verloor indien  ons  nie
dringend aandag gee aan die volgende nie: Ons moet onthou veeartse  het  dit
vir Suid-Afrikaanse boere moontlik gemaak om  suksesvol  met  vee  in  Suid-
Afrika te kan boer. Hulle het dit moontlik gemaak dat boere die aanslae  van
veesiektes doeltreffend die hoof kan bied.

Ek boer al 35 jaar lank met melkbeeste. In die begin het  ons  nie  veeartse
gehad nie. So hier en  daar  moes  'n  mens  'n  veearts  inroep,  maar  die
tegnologie het so verander dat jy deesdae nie sonder 'n veearts jou  melkery
kan voortsit nie. Indien die Regering  daarin  kan  slaag  om  beginnerboere
suksesvol te kan vestig, sal die behoefte  aan  veeartse  geweldig  toeneem.
Hierdie mense moet met gevestigde boere meeding.  Hulle  het  dus  hulp  van
veeartse baie nodiger. Daar moet dus  nou  aanmoediging  plaasvind  om  meer
mense na die beroep van veearts te trek.

Indien  ons  ernstig  is  aangaande  nuwe  boere  in  die  bedryf  sal   ons
veeartsenykundige dienste in  die  landbou  drasties  moet  opknap.  Hierdie
dienste in die landbou het  baie  agteruitgegaan.  Laat  ons  dit  asseblief
regstel.  Landbou  in  Suid-Afrika  is  baie  dankbaar  dat  bek-en-klouseer
doeltreffend bekamp is. Dit is egter kommerwekkend dat jongmense nie  getrek
en behou word nie, en  dat  in  navorsing  en  patologiese  dienste  net  ou
gesigte gesien word.

Patoloë moet sorg dat bek-en-klouseer en ander siektes  vinnig  gediagnoseer
word. Ons moet seker maak wat die toedrag van  sake  by  ons  is.  Ons  moet
jongmense trek, maar die beeld wat die Regering skep  met  die  afskaal  van
dienste en beurse by navorsing in veeartsenykunde is dat dit  nie  belangrik
geag word nie. Indien my bekommernis gegrond is, sal  doeltreffende  dienste
vorentoe al minder word, en minder doeltreffend wees.

Die grensdraad by Messina wat ons help om bek-en-klouseer  te  beheer,  moet
herstel word.

'n AGB LID: Dit is herstel.

Mnr A S VAN DER MERWE: Dit is  nog  nie  herstel  nie,  dit  terwyl  bek-en-
klouseer-uitbrekings in Zimbabwe al langs die pad na Beitbrug loop. Kan  ons
gerus  slaap  en  toelaat   dat   ons   veeartsenykundige   dienste   verder
agteruitgaan? Dit help mos nie die wette is in plek, maar die  dienslewering
verswak algaande nie. Met  die  DA  se  besoek  aan  Onderstepoort  was  dit
verblydend om te sien dat die opleiding nog steeds van die beste is, en  dat
daar by die fakulteit nie 'n verlaging van standaarde is nie.

Ek wil die agb Minister vra om die rol uit te spel wat veeartse by mense  se
gesondheid   moet   speel,   byvoorbeeld   by   slagplase   en   hawens   en
veeartsenyinspeksies soos verpligte dip. Dit wil vir my lyk  of  daar  gekyk
moet word na die plek van para-veeartsenykundige  dienste,  wat  hulle  plek
is, en of dit nie die druk op veeartse kan verlig nie. Dit mag net  nie  die
standaard van dienste verlaag nie. Die portefeuljekomitee het  juis  hieroor
gevra vir verteenwoordiging van elk  van  hierdie  para-veeartsenyprofessies
op die raad.

Die DA sal hierdie wetgewing steun.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A S VAN DER MERWE: This Bill prescribes exactly how the list of  persons
submitted to the Minister  should  be  compiled.  The  portfolio  committee,
owing to the delay in making nominations for the council and  the  resultant
appointments, insisted on a clause rendering the  Minister  responsible,  so
that the Department of Agriculture would give timeous and  written  feedback
to the portfolio committee concerning resignations and  appointments  within
30 days of these taking place.

The portfolio committee was also of the view that a reasonably  simple  Bill
such as this one took too long to finalise because of  poor  continuity  and
submission sessions by the state's law advisers.  I  want  to  request  that
this problem should be eliminated in the future.

The committee was also of the view that there is a great need  to  transform
the industry by drawing  a  larger  variety  of  people  to  the  veterinary
profession. Although the Bill provides a basis it will come  to  nothing  if
the hon the Minister does not actively  devote  attention  to  quite  a  few
points of concern.

The first of these is funding. Funding of veterinary services is not in  the
least adequate. I would not like to base my contribution on reproaches.  For
quite a few years the opposition has been appealing for adequate  funds  for
the Agricultural Research Council, for example. Year after year the  appeals
have been declined. Our predecessor proudly and rightly  so  made  reference
to the process of transformation. This cannot take  the  place  of  adequate
funds.

Now the  Auditor-General  has  warned  in  his  auditor's  report  that  the
activities of the Agricultural Research Council are collapsing  owing  to  a
lack of funds. I urgently request  that  veterinary  services  and  research
should please not go the way of the Agricultural Research Council  owing  to
a lack of funds. A country that allows its research to lag behind  will  not
be able to continue to exist viably.

I am asking myself why 25% of  veterinary  posts  in  the  country  are  not
filled. Is it because the salaries are insufficient?  Is  it  because  posts
are being kept vacant for transformation? If I am correct in that posts  are
being kept vacant for  transformation,  the  hon  the  Minister  should  ask
herself what the problem is.

I am of the view that new emerging veterinarians see the profession  as  one
that does not have  the  necessary  status.  If  I  am  correct,  an  urgent
campaign is required to put an end to this incorrect perception.   Is  there
any truth in the rumour that there are unemployed  black  veterinarians  who
are not being appointed by the department, while 25% of the  posts  are  not
filled?

This Bill will lose its value as a basis completely if we  do  not  urgently
devote attention to the following: We must remember that veterinarians  have
made it possible  for  South  African  farmers  to  farm  successfully  with
livestock  in  South  Africa.  They  have  made  it  possible  for   farmers
effectively to overcome the onslaught of livestock diseases.

I have been farming with dairy cattle for 35 years. In the beginning we  did
not have veterinarians. Here and there one had to call  in  a  veterinarian,
but technology has changed so much that these days one cannot have  a  dairy
without a veterinarian.  If  the  Government  can  succeed  in  establishing
beginner farmers, the need for veterinarians  increase  tremendously.  These
people must compete with established farmers.  They  therefore  have  a  far
greater need for the  assistance  of  veterinarians.  There  should  now  be
encouragement to draw more people to the veterinary profession.

If we are serious about  new  farmers  in  the  industry  we  will  have  to
drastically improve veterinary services in agriculture.  These  services  in
agriculture have deteriorated  drastically.  Please  let  us  rectify  this.
Agriculture in  South  Africa  is  very  grateful  that  the  foot-and-mouth
disease has been combated effectively. It is  disconcerting,  however,  that
younger people are  not  drawn  and  retained,  and  that  in  research  and
pathology services only the old faces can be seen.

Pathologists have to ensure that foot-and-mouth disease and  other  diseases
are diagnosed quickly. We must  determine  the  state  of  affairs  in  this
regard. We must draw young people, but the  impression  the  Government,  in
scaling down services and bursaries in respect  of  research  in  veterinary
science, is creating that it is is not considered important. If my  concerns
are founded, in future effective services will become  increasingly  scarce,
and less effective.

The boundary fence at Messina, which  helps  us  to  control  foot-and-mouth
disease, must be repaired.

An HON MEMBER: It has been repaired.

Mr A S VAN DER MERWE: It has not yet been repaired,  and  that  while  there
are outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in Zimbabwe, all along the  road  to
Beit Bridge. Can we sleep peacefully and allow our  veterinary  services  to
deteriorate further? Surely it does  not  help  that  there  are  laws,  but
service delivery  is  gradually  growing  worse.  With  the  DA's  visit  to
Onderstepoort it was gratifying to see that the training  is  still  of  the
best, and there has been no lowering of standards at the faculty.
I want to ask the hon the Minister to expound the  role  that  veterinarians
have to play in the health of people, for example  at  abattoirs  and  ports
and at veterinary inspections such as compulsory dipping. It seems to me  as
if the place of para-veterinary services should be  looked  at,  what  their
place is and whether this could relieve the pressure on  veterinarians.  The
only thing is that it may not lower the standard of services.  In  fact,  in
this regard the portfolio committee asked for the representation of each  of
these para-veterinary services in the council.

The DA will support this legislation. [Applause.]]

Mnr S ABRAM: Voorsitter, dit is 'n voorreg om die agb lid Van der  Merwe  op
te  volg.  Die  agb  lid  het  hier  gepraat  uit  praktiese   ervaring   en
ondervinding. Ek wil net graag beklemtoon dat ons basiese  probleem  is  dat
baie min van ons jongmense vandag bereid is om met  oorpakke  en  veldskoene
aan te gaan werk, en om hulle hande in te steek in die agterent van 'n  perd
of 'n koei. Hulle beywer hulself liewer vir  werkgeleenthede  waar  'n  mens
met 'n das of 'n pak werk toe moet gaan. Ons sal  daadwerklike  stappe  moet
neem om die belangrikheid van veeartsenydienste by  ons  jongmense  te  laat
posvat. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr S ABRAM: Chairperson, it is a privilege to speak after  the  hon  member
Van  der  Merwe.  The  hon  member  spoke  from  practical  experience   and
knowledge. I would just like to stress that our basic problem  is  that  too
few of our youth today are prepared to  go  to  work  wearing  overalls  and
veldskoens, and to stick their hands into the rear end of a  horse  or  cow.
They rather strive for job opportunities where they go  to  work  wearing  a
tie or a suit. We will have to take decisive steps to let the importance  of
veterinary services take root with our youth.]

I want to say that, unfortunately, I am not going to speak  about  the  Bill
because whatever one wanted to say has already been  said,  as  far  as  the
Bill goes. But, the veterinary field as a whole is  an  extremely  important
one. As a country, we have identified agriculture as one  of  those  avenues
which  must  help  with  the  upliftment   of   historically   disadvantaged
individuals. It is going to be extremely important that we see  to  it  that
the sector has the necessary support services.

As far as livestock is concerned, hon members are aware that we  are  making
some headway and many countries are beginning to have some interest  in  our
export of livestock products. But the countries  that  we  are  looking  to,
particularly those  countries  that  get  the  jitters  when  there  is  the
slightest outbreak of some or other disease such as BSE or mad  cow  disease
in the United Kingdom, and the recent outbreak of Foot-and-Mouth Disease  in
Europe, will naturally demand extremely high health standards  in  order  to
import our products. That is one of the routes that we will have to  go,  to
promote the export of our products and, in that way,  to  help  historically
disadvantaged individuals and new emerging farmers on the road  to  success.
That is largely dependent on the veterinary profession.

The veterinary profession must not just be seen as a  profession  where  one
has to put one's hand into the back of a cow or a horse,  but  it  has  some
other side issues which are extremely important, such as  the  *breeding  of
better genetics, where veterinarians are involved in issues such  as  embryo
transplants and other things such as these. [Time expired.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairman, whilst the ACDP is  mindful  that  these  provisions
may well be essential at this point in our history ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Carry on, member.

Mrs C DUDLEY: ... this legislation is  discriminatory  and  as  such  should
include a sunset clause, which can be reviewed after 10 years.  Today's  so-
called ``positive discrimination'' is tomorrow's unfair labour practice.

High standards in this sector are not  only  vital  to  the  health  of  the
public, but critical to the life of the agricultural  industry,  which  must
have the confidence of consumers both locally and abroad. It  is  imperative
that new measures do not in any way lead to the deterioration  of  standards
in the profession or compromise this major industry.

Political goals to ensure constitutionality and  representivity,  etc,  must
be met, but  without  economically  damaging  the  country,  for  such  good
intentions will backfire on the very people they are meant to  empower.  The
ACDP will vote in favour of this Bill, but believes that all South  Africans
should be living under  the  same  rules,  and  calls  on  the  Minister  to
introduce  a  sunset  clause  wherever  positive  discrimination  has   been
legislated.

Mr P H K  DITSHETELO:  Chairperson,  the  UCDP  welcomes  the  proposed  and
discussed Veterinary and Para-veterinary Professions Amendment  Bill,  which
seeks to change, amongst other things, the composition of  the  council,  as
it has become apparent that the constitution no longer  performs  the  daily
requirements and that certain provisions of the Act are  not  in  line  with
principles laid down by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.

The revised model of the future constitution  of  the  council  does,  to  a
certain extent, address the key issues  that  would  make  the  new  council
nondiscriminatory, and representative and democratic in its composition,  to
be able to serve all South Africans indeed, and  recognises  the  importance
of the needs of consumers and clients from all  sectors  of  the  community.
With the amendments effected to the above critical areas of the Act, I  have
no doubt in my mind  that  the  council's  composition  will  no  longer  be
unconstitutional, as it will  be  able  to  respond  to  the  needs  of  the
country. What is left is for the Bill to be voted upon so  that  able  South
Africans can be nominated to serve on the council as a  matter  of  urgency.
The UCDP supports the Bill. [Time expired.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, the PAC supports this Bill which has  undertaken
to adjust obsolete  clauses  and  amend  the  Act  in  accordance  with  the
Constitution of our land.

Perhaps the most important consideration is concern for the citizens of  our
land who were previously disadvantaged.  Veterinary  professions  should  be
open to all. I would like to add that the current view  that  some  sections
of our population do not treat animals well stems from  inadequate  training
of members of these sections. Veterinary training  and  veterinary  services
should be encouraged among those who were previously disadvantaged.

Amendments effecting the reconstitution  of  the  South  African  Veterinary
Council are also  welcomed.  The  new  council  will  be  respectable,  have
integrity and raise standards for all. The PAC supports this Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the professions focused on in this Bill  holds
great,  importance  for  both  the  rural  and  urban   communities.   These
professions specialisation in animal care does not only maintain the  health
of pets, but also that of livestock, livestock that represents an income  to
many farmers and a source of food for nonvegetarians.

It is noted that the earlier  Bill  established  ...  [Interjections.]  Yes,
until the hon member took it away from me. It  is  noted  that  the  earlier
Bill established  a  council  to  regulate  veterinary  and  para-veterinary
professions. Certain aspects of its constitution were found not  to  conform
with the Constitution of the Republic. The amending Bill appears to  correct
that by  restructuring  the  SA  Veterinary  Council  so  as  to  bring  its
constitution in line with the Constitution of the Republic.

The MF notes the necessity of complying with the national  Constitution  and
therefore supports the amendments made. [Applause.]

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  The  hon  Miss   Rajbally
completed her speech in 60 seconds despite the interruptions by the  hon  Mr
Mike Ellis.

Mnr  C  AUCAMP:  Voorsitter,  die  AEB  steun  die  Wysigingswetsontwerp  op
Veeartseny- en Paraveeartsenykundige dienste. Dit lyk vir ons  na  'n  goeie
en gebalanseerde wetsontwerp. Die raad sal selfregulering toepas,  maar  met
die nodige insette van die staat, en daarom kan ons daarmee saamgaan.

Ek stem met die Minister saam dat dit onkonstitusioneel is  om  'n  taal  of
tale af te dwing op lede  van  die  raad,  maar  is  dit  nie  dalk  net  so
onkonstitusioneel om studente wat op Onderstepoort as veeartse opgelei  word
as't ware te forseer om in net een taal, naamlik Engels,  onderrig  te  word
nie? Ons is baie dankbaar dat studente darem wel in ander tale  die  eksamen
mag skryf.

Alle veeartse word op Onderstepoort opgelei, en die  staat  het  ook  daarby
belang. Ons kan hierdie kwessie daarom nie net aan  die  markkragte  oorlaat
met die ooreenkoms wat die Universiteit van Pretoria gehad het nie. Ons  vra
die Minister om toe te sien dat  ons  studente  ook  meer  in  lyn  met  die
Grondwet meertalig hulle onderrig kan ontvang.

Ons steun hierdie wetsontwerp, en ons glo dat dit in belang is van  'n  baie
belangrike bedryf in ons landbougemeenskap, en ook verder.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP:  Chairperson,  the  AEB  supports  the  Veterinary  and  Para-
veterinary Professions Amendment Bill. To us it seems like a good and  well-
balanced  Bill.  The  council  will  apply  self-regulation,  but  with  the
necessary inputs from the state, and that is why we are able to  agree  with
it.

I agree with the Minister that it is unconstitutional to  force  a  language
or languages on members of the council, but  is  it  not  possibly  just  as
unconstitutional to train students at  Onderstepoort  as  veterinarians  and
actually force them to be trained in only one language, namely  English?  We
are very grateful that students are at least allowed to  write  examinations
in other languages.

All veterinarians  are  trained  at  Onderstepoort  and  the  state  has  an
interest in that as well. We cannot,  therefore,  leave  this  issue  to  be
solved by the market forces  with  the  agreement  that  the  University  of
Pretoria had. We ask the Minister to see to it  that  our  students  receive
their multilinguistic tuition in line with the Constitution.

We support this Bill and believe that it  is  in  the  interest  of  a  very
important industry in our farming community and even further.]

Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Mr Chairman, the Bill under discussion in its present  form
differs substantially  from  the  original  Bill  as  tabled.  Although  the
portfolio committee under the  chairmanship  of  Nkosi  Holomisa  must  take
credit  for  the  final  product,  it  is   a   pity   that   a   relatively
straightforward  piece  of  legislation  required  so  much  panel  beating.
Although there is a reluctance to apportion blame, evading the  issue  could
send the incorrect signal.

At the  outset,  the  newly  elected  chairman  of  the  Veterinary  Council
admitted that he had not been briefed about the Bill  and  was  consequently
ill-equipped to provide  the  necessary  guidance  and  information  to  the
portfolio committee. During the subsequent meetings,  the  former  chairman,
Dr Peter Addington, did his best, but had to admit that  in  some  instances
the legislation was illogical, had not been properly  workshopped,  and  was
generally shoddy. This is not the type of legislation one would expect  from
a professional society, which surely has access to some of best legal  brain
power.

A fair amount of this criticism  must  also  be  apportioned  to  the  legal
section within the  Department  of  Agriculture.  It  would  seem  that  the
original author or authors of this piece of  legislation  vanished,  and  it
was, accordingly, passed around. This was not  the  quality  of  legislation
emanating  from  the  Department  of  Agriculture  to  which  the  portfolio
committee had become accustomed, and we trust that this will not  signify  a
possible future trend.
Although the temptation was to  request  that  the  Bill  be  withdrawn  and
rewritten, the committee applied its mind and the final  product  should  be
to the advantage of the veterinary  and  para-veterinary  professions.   All
the parties present made significant contributions, which  resulted  in  the
final product, on which there was total consensus, as we heard today.

I am not going to repeat what has already been said. We are  glad  that  the
council is now smaller. The election process has been streamlined  and  this
Bill also strengthens the portfolio committee's oversight role in  that  the
Minister must submit the names of the new council  within  a  period  of  30
days. We are also glad  that  veterinarians  who  were  qualified  in  other
countries can now be accommodated to practise in this country and  that,  if
they want to specialise, there is an examination required if  so  judged  by
the council. This Bill also seeks to amend the Pharmacy Act of 1974, as  has
been said. Many veterinarians have been contravening the law and  dispensing
and keeping medicines. This oversight has now been rectified.
This House expresses its appreciation to the veterinary profession  for  the
task  they  are  performing  in  aid  of  animal  health  in  general.  More
specifically, there are many veterinarians  and  para-veterinarians  in  our
rural areas, often  far  removed  from  the  daily  comforts  of  modern-day
living. They are indispensible in the production  and  reproduction  of  our
farm  animals  and  game.  Their  role  in  keeping  the  shelves   of   our
supermarkets full with what we eat and drink as well as our game parks  well
stocked is often not appreciated.

By paying a  special  tribute  to  them  I  do  not  want  to  minimise  the
contribution of those who are so dedicated to caring for  the  wellbeing  of
our pets, be it cats, dogs or budgies. I thank  them  very  much.  They  all
deserve to be recognised for their professionalism. The  ANC  supports  this
amending Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  Deputy  Minister,  in
calling on you I trust that you have taken note that the  hon  the  Minister
of Home Affairs has been present for the entire debate to support the Bill.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Mr  Chairperson,  I
actually wanted to mention that when I came on now. But I know the  hon  the
Minister of Home Affairs as a man  who  loves  cattle  and  I  am  going  to
mention it to the king the next time I  see  him,  that  where  it  concerns
these matters, his prime minister was present.

Mr Chairman, let me quickly say that I completely  agree  with  Dr  Schoeman
regarding the quality of this legislation. It has a very strange history  of
how it came here. Let us be thankful that we are here. But next  time  I  am
going to ask my Minister whether I cannot just personally rewrite the  Bill.
I am sure we can do a better job. But we will get it out.

Could I just thank two  persons  from  the  opposition  today  who  were  an
example of what opposition really looks like. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  members,  no  business  in
the aisles.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: I would like to thank Mr A  S  van  der  Merwe  and  Mr
Abram, who constantly  in  agriculture  debates  show  what  the  opposition
should really be like. I am going to ask for a Hansard copy of  Mr  Van  der
Merwe's speech to study it in detail, because he addressed  a  lot  of  very
important things.

Let me just say that at the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of  the
Orange Free State in Bloemfontein, there is a very beautiful building  which
I passed by for many years, on which something is written  in  Afrikaans  as
some kind of guidance for those who study agriculture. In English  it  would
read as follows:


  A nation that looks after its future looks after its agriculture.

But, it reads as follows:


  'n Volk wat vir sy toekoms sorg, sorg vir sy landbou.

I think we must think very seriously about that. If we look  at  our  future
we must care for our agriculture  and  the  veterinary  and  para-veterinary
sciences are primary in that respect.

Let me firstly  tell  Mr  Van  der  Merwe  that  I  recently  had  extensive
discussions with the faculty at Onderstepoort, and on the previous Monday  I
had an interview with the dean of the faculty on bursaries, something  which
comes a long way. We have a real problem with far too few  black  veterinary
students at Onderstepoort and the only way to get it right is  by  providing
bursaries. It is very expensive and one needs something like R30 000 a  year
to study at Onderstepoort.

Do hon members know what is happening at Onderstepoort?  The  profession  is
becoming a woman's profession. About 70% of the  students  at  Onderstepoort
are women. It is becoming a  profession  for  women.  However,  there  is  a
problem in that some very tough work has to be undertaken and,  also,  there
is dangerous work in some remote areas. We need the men there as  well.  The
problem is that we do not have black students.  Previously,  bursaries  were
provided in the provinces and  in  the  old  Bantustans,  but  that  is  not
happening at the moment. I have given strict instructions that  the  bursary
scheme  be  developed  and  that  this   transformation   takes   place   at
Onderstepoort. We must do it. [Applause.]

This whole Bill is about transformation and we are going  to  guide  it  and
see whether it is going to work in practice. We must get  representivity  in
terms of race and gender. It is  very  difficult  in  the  veterinary  field
today, because if I as veterinarian want to do an operation on  a  cow,  one
needs the same kind of skills that one would need  to  operate  on  a  human
being in a hospital. The value of  the  cow  determines  the  value  of  the
operation. That makes it difficult to  really  compensate  veterinarians  to
the full extent.

Hon members must please go and visit Onderstepoort. It is one of  the  great
assets of this country. That animal hospital in Onderstepoort  -  if  I  get
ill, I want to be treated there, rather than at any other hospital in  South
Africa. [Laughter.] It is a very beautiful place and a very good  place.  It
is an asset. We must open it to all  the  people  of  South  Africa.  It  is
beautiful. Do hon members know what the interesting thing is?  It  has  been
proven that veterinary students come from the rural areas. The city guys  do
not want to do this type of thing, except  deal  with  pets.  For  the  real
economical veterinary science, we must get the people from the  rural  areas
and we must make money available to help them study there.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, we are  now  going
to proceed to the next item on the Order Paper, and I need  to  give  you  a
brief explanation, because it is  not  ...  [Interjections.]  Yes,  you  are
absolutely right.

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                     CULTURAL LAWS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

   (Consideration of Bill, as amended by NCOP, and of Report of Portfolio
         Committee on Arts, Culture, Science and Technology thereon)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I would like to remind  members
that on Friday, 19 October, the ATCs had the  following  to  submit  to  the
House:


  The Portfolio Committee on Arts, Culture, Science and Technology,  having

  reports that it  has  not  accepted  the  amendments  of  the  Bill,  and
  therefore recommends that the House reject this amended  version  of  the
  Bill, in terms of Joint Rule 186(1)(b).

The Bill therefore stands referred to the Mediation Committee.

Order disposed of without debate.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:
National Assembly:

1.    Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development on the Judicial  Matters  Amendment  Bill  [B  43  -  2001]
     (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 18 October 2001:


     The Portfolio Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development,
     having considered the subject of the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill [B
     43 - 2001] (National Assembly - sec 75), referred to it and  classified
     by the Joint Tagging Mechanism as a section 75 Bill, reports  the  Bill
     with amendments [B 43A - 2001], and endorses the classification of  the
     Bill as a section 75 Bill.


     The Committee wishes to report as follows:


     1.     Sections 309B and 309C of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977  (Act
         No. 51 of 1977), which regulated appeals from the lower  courts  to
         the  High  Courts,  were  declared  to  be  inconsistent  with  the
         Constitution, in the case of S v Steyn (Case No.  CCT  19/00).  The
         Department  of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  prepared
         amendments to the relevant provisions  of  the  Criminal  Procedure
         Act, 1977, to bring it in  line  with  the  Constitutional  Court's
         judgment. These amendments were placed before  the  Committee  with
         the view of including them in the above Bill.


         The Committee decided, in view of the  substantial  nature  of  the
         relevant amendments, that the matter should  be  dealt  with  in  a
         separate Bill which should be introduced in Parliament as  soon  as
         possible.


     2.     Clause 6 of the Bill, which introduces a new section 63A in  the
         Criminal Procedure Act, 1977, provides for the release  of  accused
         persons or amendment of the bail conditions of accused  persons  on
         account of prison conditions. This provision aims to contribute  to
         the  reduction  in  the  number   of   unsentenced   prisoners   in
         overcrowded prisons.


         The Committee received a proposal  for  the  further  amendment  of
         Chapter 9 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977, so as to prevent  an
         accused person,  who  has  been  granted  bail,  ending  up  as  an
         awaiting-trial prisoner simply because of his or her  inability  to
         pay the amount of bail  determined  by  the  court.  This  proposal
         entails that an obligation should be placed on  presiding  officers
         to take the personal circumstances of an accused more closely  into
         account when determining the amount of bail,  and  that  bail  must
         always be fixed at an amount which the accused  person  can  afford
         to pay.


         The Committee is of the view that an amendment of this  nature  may
         assist  in  curbing  the  unnecessary  influx   of   awaiting-trial
         prisoners charged  with  lesser  crimes  into  prisons.  Since  the
         proposal was received  at  a  late  stage  during  the  Committee's
         deliberations on the above Bill,  the  Department  of  Justice  and
         Constitutional Development is requested to investigate  the  matter
         thoroughly  and  to  introduce  appropriate  amending   legislation
         during the next session of Parliament.


     Report to be considered.
