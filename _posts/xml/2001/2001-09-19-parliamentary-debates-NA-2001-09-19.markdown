                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Miss M N MAGAZI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  United States initiatives to rally the international community
           to fight against terrorism are leading to an emergence of
           coalition;


       (b)  whilst many key allies of the United States have pledged their
           support to fight terrorism, they are reluctant on the prospect
           of launching strikes against Afghanistan; and


       (c)  the Markinor survey released yesterday indicated that the South
           African population is deeply divided on launching strikes
           against Afghanistan, with 44% supporting the attack and 46%
           against the attack;


  (2) supports investigation to bring the perpetrators of this terror
       attack to book; and


  (3) restates its view that the United States must not embark on actions
       that will -


       (a)  polarise the world and threaten international peace and
           solidarity;


       (b)  kill innocent and unarmed civilians - especially women and
           children; and


       (c)  spread negative sentiments ...

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Minister of Defence has, since February, failed to answer
           specific questions relating to the arms procurement deal;


       (b)  the Minister of Finance cites exemptions of the Access to
           Information Act to avoid releasing the Roland White memoranda;
       (c)  the Minister of Public Enterprises ignores correspondence
           raising questions about parastatals' investments at Coega; and


       (d)  the Minister of Trade and Industry reveals minimal information
           on offset projects;


  (2) hopes that the Ministers are co-operating with the Joint
       Investigating Team more transparently; and


  (3) calls on these Ministers to live up to their promises made at a press
       conference at Johannesburg International Airport to act
       transparently, not in collective obfuscation.

[Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock and dismay the injury to 30 people as a result of a
       heavy storm and lightning reported at Tembisa and surrounding areas
       in Gauteng;


  (2) appeals to every citizen that, although the storms, the snows, the
       floods, etc, are all acts of God, His folk must remain vigilant and
       alert to any eventuality in our troubled times; and


  (3) expresses its sympathy to all affected people for the loss of
       property and disruption of business in the area.

Mr L M KGWELE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Israeli armed forces withdrew from the Gaza Strip in
       response to the Israeli Prime Minister's call for a ceasefire;


  (2) further notes that the Leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mr Yasser
       Arafat, gave orders to the Palestinian police not to shoot at the
       Israeli armed forces;


  (3) believes that the cessation of hostility from both sides provides an
       opportunity for the resumption of negotiations;


  (4) welcomes the truce; and


  (5) calls on the leaders and the people of Israel and Palestine to work
       towards a peaceful resolution of the Middle East crisis.

[Applause.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DA:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note with horror that a single syndicate uncovered by the
       Police in Johannesburg was able to sell 11 000 forged driving
       licences to the amount of R16,5 million;


  (2) recognises that in road safety terms, this translates into 11 000
       licences to kill more innocent South African motorists, passengers
       and pedestrians; and


  (3) urges the Minister of Transport to act decisively to stop the carnage
       on South African roads or, if he lacks the courage to do so, to
       retire gracefully rather than once again to demonstrate the ANC
       Government's impotence to deal with criminality on South Africa's
       roads.

Mrs Z A KOTA: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: The hon member moved the
motion on behalf of the DA and there is no DA in the House. There is the DP
and the New NP.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: It is not really the first time that members have
mentioned the DA, but, in fact, that is not accurate. There is no party
called the DA in this Parliament. [Interjections.]
Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) strongly condemns the apparent arson attack on the Muslim Judicial
       Council head office during the early hours of this morning;


  (2) fervently hopes that in this time of high emotional tension, all
       South Africans will demonstrate restraint and that, as a nation, we
       shall exercise tolerance, respect and understanding; and


  (3) calls on all citizens of South Africa to unite against all forms of
       terrorism and violence, and urges the law enforcers to find the
       perpetrators and bring them to book.

Mrs T P SHILUBANA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that in August 2001 the inflation rate reached its target of
       6%, ahead of the expectation of analysts;


  (2) further notes that this Government has established a regime of
       macroeconomic responsibility that has enabled the economy of this
       country to recover and has laid the foundation for economic growth;


  (3) commends the Reserve Bank and the National Treasury for reaching this
       target; and


  (4) calls on investors, both national and international, to-


       (a)  recognise that the economy of this country has never before been
           so soundly managed; and


       (b)  make productive investments that will enhance growth,
           development and employment, which will benefit not only their
           own bottom line, but also the country and the economy of our
           country.

[Applause.]
Dr P W A MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis daarvan kennis neem dat -


  (1) die Vryheidsfront gedurende die parlementÃªre reses 'n volwaardige tak
       van die party in Londen gestig het;


  (2) die VF tot hierdie stap besluit het in die lig van die groot aantal
       Afrikaanssprekendes wat hulle tans in Londen bevind;


  (3) die party van mening is dat hierdie jongmense nie in 'n politieke
       vakuum vir 'n jaar of meer gelaat kan word nie, maar dat hulle
       polities ingelig moet bly en aan hulle hoop gegee moet word om weer
       na Suid-Afrika terug te keer; en


  (4) hierdie VF-tak in Londen hom onder meer daarvoor sal beywer dat,
       anders as in die 1999-verkiesing, Suid-Afrikaanse burgers wat hulle
       om verskeie redes in die buiteland bevind, toegelaat sal word om te
       kan stem in die 2004-verkiesing.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FF:
  That the House notes that -


  (1) during the parliamentary recess the Freedom Front established a full-
       fledged branch of the party in London;


  (2) the FF decided to take this step in the light of the large number of
       Afrikaans speakers currently living in London;


  (3) the party is of the opinion that these young people cannot be left in
       a political vacuum for a year or more, but that they must remain
       politically informed and must be given hope to return to South
       Africa; and


  (4) this FF branch in London will, inter alia, strive to ensure that
       South African citizens who find themselves abroad for various reasons
       will be allowed to vote in the 2004 election, unlike the situation
       during the 1999 election.]
Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the MF:
  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the series of killings of Muslim and Indian shopkeepers in the
           Western Cape; and


       (b)  that a meeting was hosted with businesspersons of the attacked
           calibre, protection units, persons concerned and the Minister of
           Safety and Security, Steve Tshwete, last week to attend to the
           matter; and


  (2) calls on all departments and the public who are able to assist in the
       matter of these serious attacks, to do so.

Mr A M MAZIYA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that two Pagad members, Faizel Waggie and Ismail Edwards, were
           found guilty of bombing Lansdowne police station; and


       (b)  statements made by hon Patricia de Lille in this House last year
           that the Minister was making unsubstantiated allegations against
           Pagad;


  (2) believes that the conviction of the Pagad duo confirms Minister
       Tshwete's long-held view that Pagad is responsible for acts of urban
       terror in the Western Cape;


  (3) welcomes the conviction of the Pagad duo; and


  (4) calls on hon Patricia de Lille to retract the statement she made in
       the House on this matter.

[Applause.]

Mr V C GORE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  residents of Alexandra, Gauteng, near the Jukskei River are
           being evicted during the winter months from brick structures to
           a damp transit camp lacking water and proper toilet facilities
           in Diepsloot;


       (b)  family units have been split up during these moves; and


       (c)  the company appointed to carry out these moves is alleged to
           have assaulted residents and stolen their property;


  (2) expresses its concern at allegations that the Gauteng housing
       department failed to consult residents and give them proper warning
       of the move; and


  (3) calls on the province to stop these heavy-handed evictions and
       address the dedensification process in Alexandra in a humane and
       rights-based manner.
[Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with sadness and shock that seven people were killed and four
       critically wounded as a result of an attack on a minibus taxi,
       between Qumbu and Mount Frere in the Eastern Cape, on Sunday night;


  (2) expresses condolences to the families of the deceased of which six
       were returning from the national taxi conference in Durban; and


  (3) calls upon the authorities to launch a thorough investigation into
       the incident so as to bring the perpetrators to book.

Mr M M Z DYANI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the widening rift between the New NP and the DP;


       (b)  that the New NP wants the DA to fire Hennie Bester for publicly
           criticising Peter Marais and lobbying the DA leadership against
           him; and


       (c)  that the cracks within the New NP are also showing with Marais
           supporters vowing to oust Premier Gerald Morkel at the party's
           provincial congress later this month;


  (2) believes that the petty infighting within the DA does not bode well
       for delivery in the Western Cape; and


  (3) calls on the DA to shift its narrow-minded and inward focus on its
       own insecurities and divisions, to an outward plan of delivery,
       upliftment and transformation that will benefit all people, not just
       the privileged few.

[Applause.]

Mr H A SMIT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the abnormally high number of persons who are dying from
           HIV/Aids in South African prisons; and


       (b)  that, according to Judge Fagan, Inspecting Judge for
           Correctional Services, the estimate is that in 10 years' time 45
           000 prisoners will die in South African prisons annually;


  (2) agrees that prisoners who are HIV-negative also have rights and that
       their rights cannot be ignored;


  (3) believes that the Government can no longer ignore this situation; and


  (4) calls for a national summit as well as international assistance to
       find solutions to this enormous problem.

Mr J T MASEKA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with concern the suppression of a Medical Research Council
           report contradicting President Mbeki's ideas on the extent of
           HIV/Aids-related deaths; and


       (b)  that the Minister of Correctional Services recently stated that
           his department could soon be facing a flood of legal action
           against it, by prisoners being infected with the virus;
  (2) expresses its concern over the trend of the Government to suppress
       information regarded as politically ``incorrect'', which is
       dangerously reminiscent of the old regime; and


  (3) calls on the ANC Government to release this report to equip the
       leaders of this country to make proper and responsible decisions.

Prof B TUROK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Democratic Alliance councillor in Ward 64, Cape Town, set up
           a ward committee constituted by privileged interest groups; and


       (b)  this ward committee favours previously advantaged communities at
           the expense of the historically disadvantaged communities; and
  (2) calls on the Democratic Alliance not to treat the masses of our
       people with contempt, but to restructure ward committees to serve the
       interest of all our people, not a privileged few.

[Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! The time for notices of motion has expired and
we now come to motions without notice. Are there any motions without
notice? [Interjections.] In that case, that concludes the business of the
House.

The House adjourned at 17:19.
