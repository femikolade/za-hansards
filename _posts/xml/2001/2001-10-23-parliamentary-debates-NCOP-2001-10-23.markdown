                  DEBATE ON INTERGOVERNMENTAL FISCAL REVIEW

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  I  take  this
opportunity to welcome all the special  delegates  present  here  and  would
also like to welcome the hon  the  Minister  of  Education  and  the  Deputy
Minister of Finance.

Ms Q D  MAHLANGU:  Chairperson,  Minister  Asmal,  the  Deputy  Minister  of
Finance, MECs and special delegates, I rise with pride to table this  report
of the select committee and portfolio committees  of  both  Houses  to  this
august House. It is a product  of  intense  discussions  between  the  three
spheres of Government, members of Parliament  and  provincial  legislatures.
However, the participation of local  government  was  very  minimal,  and  I
think this House should take note of that.

The content of the report is contained in the  Announcements,  Tablings  and
Committee Reports of today. I would like to take this opportunity to  thank,
in particular, all the Ministers who participated in the debate, the  Deputy
Ministers who participated when Ministers were not available,  and  all  the
government officials who helped us.

I am not going to table the  entire  contents  of  the  report  because  the
report is about 31 pages long. My colleagues will  go  into  greater  detail
about the content of the report. I will only touch on issues that are cross-
sectoral and run across all government departments.

One of the  things  that  we  noted  in  the  hearings  was  that,  in  many
instances, there are competing priorities which  all  need  to  be  financed
with limited resources that we have  as  a  country.  In  dealing  with  the
issues that I am going to talk about, which my colleagues are also going  to
talk about later on, we have to take these  issues  into  account.  We  have
limited resources and, in that context, we have  to  make  sure  that  those
resources are spent wisely on the people that  need  to  benefit  and  in  a
manner that is going to advance and improve their lives for the better.

Secondly, in the discussions during the hearings, it was  quite  clear  that
there is no integration  and  co-operation  between  the  three  spheres  of
government. We would like to see it happening to a greater extent,  and  the
committees have recommended that that co-operation  and  integration  should
take place speedily, so  that  we  avoid  the  unnecessary  duplication  and
wasting of resources that we came across from time to time.

On the question of the departments  that  have  not  moved  towards  public-
private sector partnership  projects,  it  was  felt  that  they  should  be
encouraged to do so, and that they should use the examples of  the  National
Treasury as a guiding process towards  that,  because  there  is  value  for
money and efficiency that we are going to see at the  end  of  the  day.  In
addition, there is the transference  of  skills  from  the  private  to  the
public sector.

The problem  that  we  identified  at  the  beginning  of  the  year,  which
continued to come up during the process of  the  hearings,  was  that  there
should be an investigation around the legislation with regard to the  excess
bank charges beneficiaries of social security grants have to  pay,  and  the
Ministry  of  Finance  is  being  charged   with   the   responsibility   of
investigating this possibility. There are  also  a  lot  of  infrastructural
backlogs and, as I said earlier on, we  have  competing  priorities  and  in
responding to these challenges around infrastructure, we have to  make  sure
that we do not compromise some functions of Government  at  the  expense  of
others, and that some provinces are not worse off than others.

I would very much like to thank  all  the  staff  and  the  researchers  who
helped in preparing this report,  all  the  government  officials,  and  all
chairpersons of other committees in the  National  Assembly  and  the  NCOP.
[Applause.]

Mr P S SIZANI  (Eastern  Cape):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  of  Education,
Deputy Minister of Finance and hon members, education transformation in  the
provinces,  with  co-operative  governance  in  practice,  can  balance  and
accelerate  our  achievement  of  universal  access  to  quality  education,
resulting in a better human resource base in our economy and greater  equity
in our society.

The financial stabilisation  of  provinces  and  improvement  in  provincial
management results in the elimination of  fraud  and  corruption,  and  this
will augur well for better service delivery and the improvement  of  control
measures  to  enable  provinces  to  have  resources   for   infrastructural
development  to  eliminate  physical  classroom  backlogs,  and  to  acquire
learner support material and teacher upgrading through in-service  training.
We are currently engaged with partners in the improvement  of  research  and
planning to enable us to be better informed on these issues.

Many people concerned with education financing will be curious to  know  why
provinces that spend less on education seem to be obtaining better  results,
if one uses matric results as a measure. They will be shocked to note  that,
invariably,  all  such  provinces  only  subsidise  fee-paying  communities,
whereas most poor provinces fund everything since there are no sizable  fee-
paying parents to offset  any  budgetary  shortages  of  the  department  of
education.

We in the Eastern Cape do not like to be labelled a  poor  province.  It  is
not something that we have caused or wished for, but it  is  something  that
we inherited. If we have no private sector to sponsor schools, to  establish
endowment funds for educational improvement or any other benefactors, it  is
not because we wished for it, but because we inherited that situation.

I must use this platform to salute Mr K S Birch who donated  all  his  Eskom
bonds to the Eastern and  Northern  Cape  for  the  improvement  of  primary
school education in these two provinces. Thanks to him, some primary  school
children have a roof over their heads and better qualified teachers  in  the
Peddie and Port Elizabeth areas.

An HON MEMBER: Hear, hear!

Mr P S SIZANI (Eastern Cape): I take this opportunity to salute him  and  Mr
Ludidi of Mount Frere, who built a school for rural  poor  children  in  his
area. I wish them longer and healthier lives. The Eastern  Cape  needs  more
such people to come up and contribute to the cause  of  education.  In  this
way, we can meet our target of universal primary education coverage  by  the
year 2005.

The classroom-pupil ratio in  the  Eastern  Cape,  though  improving,  still
needs a faster rate of delivery to reduce overcrowding. Our school  building
programme has  been  accelerated  to  respond  to  this.  Our  partners  are
spending more time and effort to enable us  to  meet  our  targets  in  this
financial year.

We have, in collaboration with the department of roads and public  works  in
the Eastern Cape, developed a clearer strategy and implementation plans  for
building and maintenance of schools in which school governing bodies,  local
government structures and nongovernmental organisations  will  be  involved.
In this regard I would like to thank  DFID,  which  is  the  Department  for
Foreign  International  Development  in  the  UK,   which   sponsored   this
particular plan. This will allow us better scope to increase the  number  of
classrooms, which will relieve overcrowding and allow  for  the  removal  of
mud structures in our rural areas.
The report notes that only 16% of the  schools  in  the  Eastern  Cape  have
computers, as opposed to 84% of schools in Gauteng, which is better  endowed
than us. This underlies the other fact: Not only do we have poor parents  in
our province, but these schools also have no buildings, no telephone  lines,
no water and no sanitation. They even have no  fences  to  secure  them.  On
this front we are facing an uphill battle, yet we cannot throw in the  towel
since children in the Eastern Cape deserve the best too.

In this regard I have prioritised the training of school  governing  bodies,
which will intensify in the new year, so  that  they  can  take  control  of
discipline and curtail burglaries, theft and violence  in  schools.  We  are
also mobilising parents, who,  in  many  rural  areas,  are  illiterate,  to
participate in the education of their children. This will  allow  them  more
involvement  in  the  protection  of  learners   from   sexual   abuse   and
harassments. These children are facing communities and  their  own  teachers
harassing them.

Teenage pregnancies, HIV/Aids and a high dropout rate, especially among  the
girl learners,  can  be  curtailed  if  we  succeed  in  encouraging  public
representatives, including councillors, to be involved  in  programmes,  led
by school governing bodies, for moral renewal and  the  social  regeneration
of school community behavioural standards.

With this concerted effort by all stakeholders, rich provinces could  be  in
for a big  surprise  from  poor  provinces,  especially  the  Eastern  Cape,
regarding the  2001  matric  results.  [Interjections.]  I  agree  with  the
Treasury view that says infrastructure involvement, systems improvement  and
maintenance precede the hiring of teachers. It is our  intention  to  pursue
this practice without neglecting teacher development for  higher  value  for
money, and management capacity- building  for  bigger  delivery  and  better
communication with our people so that they can know  what  is  going  on  in
their government in the country. [Applause.]

Ms O H ZILLE (Western Cape): Chairperson, it is  my  pleasure  to  speak  in
this debate on the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review, which has given us  many
very useful  insights  into  a  very  valuable  document  indeed,  and  will
continue to do so.

South Africa's first democratic Government effected a decisive shift in  the
centre of gravity of the national Budget, from one weighted under  apartheid
towards defence and internal security, to a focus on the social services  of
education, health and welfare, and we warmly welcome that.

South Africa's education budget, around 7% of  gross  domestic  product,  is
high by any standards, placing us in the top 10%  of  developing  countries.
At the  same  time,  Government  achieved  greater  funding  equity  between
provinces, and we in the Western Cape welcome that as well.

In die vroeë 1990s was die Wes-Kaap die provinsie wat  by  verre  die  beste
befonds was. Daarom moes die Wes-Kaap ook gaan deur 'n baie moeilike  proses
van rasionalisering. Op 'n per-leerder-basis  was  die  Wes-Kaap  sowat  70%
beter befonds as die land in sy geheel in 1994. Die situasie het  sedertdien
drasties  verander.  Die  Wes-Kaap  moes  onder  meer  8  000  onderwysposte
verloor. Ons was so suksesvol in ons rasionalisasiepogings dat  daar  vandag
twee provinsies is, Gauteng en die Noord-Kaap, wat  beter  befonds  word  as
die Wes-Kaap, gereken  op  'n  per-leerder-basis.  Die  gemiddelde  leerder-
opvoeder verhouding in die Wes-Kaap vergelyk  tans  goed  met  die  land  se
gemiddelde.

Die  oorsig  toon  die  Wes-Kaap  het  'n  lae  persentasie  van  sy  totale
beskikbare bedrag aan onderwys bestee vergeleke met  ander  provinsies.  Die
WKOD bestee op 'n per-leerder-basis die derde meeste van al  die  provinsies
in die land. Een van die redes hiervoor is die provinsie se  relatief  beter
uitslae wat tot gevolg het dat leerders vinniger  deur  die  stelsel  vloei.
Nog  'n  bydraende  faktor  is   streng   beheer   oor   leerdergetalle   en
onderouderdomleerders. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In the early 1990s the Western Cape was by far the province that  had  been
funded the best. That is why the Western Cape  had  to  go  through  a  very
difficult process of rationalisation. In  1994  the  Western  Cape  was  70%
better funded on a per-learner basis  than  the  country  as  a  whole.  The
situation has since changed drastically. The Western Cape  had  to,  amongst
others,  lose  8  000  teaching  posts.  We  were  so  successful   in   our
rationalisation efforts that, calculated on a per-learner basis,  there  are
now two provinces, Gauteng  and  the  Northern  Province,  that  are  better
funded than the Western Cape. The average  learner-educator  ratio  compares
favourably to the rest of the country's average.

The review shows that, compared to other provinces, the Western  Cape  spent
a low percentage of its total  disposable  budget  on  education.  The  WCED
spends, on a per-learner basis the third most of all the provinces.  One  of
the reasons for this is  the  province's  relatively  better  results  which
result in learners flowing through the system quicker. Another  contributory
factor is strict control over learner totals and underage learners.]

A  fundamental  value  enshrined  in  our  Constitution   is   equality   of
opportunity. This  cannot  be  measured  only  by  the  level  of  resources
transferred to poorer provinces and schools. The review states:


  There is no necessary  correlation  between  funds  received  and  matric
  results. In fact, often provinces that direct a lower proportion of their
  budgets towards education produce better matric results.

The report continues to comment:


  Funds alone do not guarantee effective education ...

And:


  ... management of resources is a critical priority.

One of the most important lessons I have learnt  in  public  life  is  this:
Pouring money into inefficient systems does nothing to improve  performance.
It is just a waste of money. There are some  schools  in  the  Western  Cape
that would continue to produce pitiful results at every level,  even  if  we
were to quadruple their funding. This is  obviously,  therefore,  the  wrong
strategy to follow.

Research by Professor Servaas van der Berg illustrated this  principle  very
clearly. He compared the growth in matric passes of individual provinces  to
the growth in their budgets. He plotted the results on a graph.  The  result
is more or less a straight line, but the line goes in the wrong direction.

Die grafiek dui aan dat hoe meer 'n onderwysdepartment se  begroting  groei,
hoe minder leerders slaag matriek, en omgekeerd. [The graph shows  that  the
more an  education  department's  budget  grows,  the  fewer  learners  pass
matric, and vice versa.]

This cannot be taken as a rule, and I am very anxious that the brutality  of
our own rationalisation process in the Western Cape over the past few  years
may be one of the factors that leads to a decline in our matric  pass  rate.
Another factor may well be the very substantial  change  in  demography  and
the funding that is retrospective, which I do not think  covers  the  number
of learners we have by a significant margin. We welcome  every  learner  who
has a chance in this province to do well in  the  schools  that  we  try  to
manage well for that purpose.

My point is that additional funds do not necessarily  guarantee  educational
success. We have to look at outcomes  to  determine  whether  our  money  is
being well spent. One of the very few  indicators  that  we  have  of  these
outcomes currently is to see how many children  survive  until  matric,  and
another is the matric exam itself. Many pupils do not survive in the  system
until the matric exam, but nearly half of the children  who  do,  experience
these exams as a devastating brick wall.

Although we do not have a systematic picture of what our  children  are,  or
are not learning in previous grades, that is before  matric,  what  research
does exist all points in the same direction. In our poorest schools  in  the
Western Cape it would seem that there is a disaster happening  in  terms  of
performance levels in literacy and numeracy, the foundations  on  which  all
other forms of learning depend. Assessment of learning at the end  of  Grade
3 indicates that children are already a good two  years  behind  what  their
teachers and administrators expect of them.

Louise Crouch, in a very good piece of research  published  at  the  end  of
1999, calculated that it takes an average of nine learner  years  of  effort
to get to Grade 7. That is a serious indictment of  the  efficiency  of  our
system - and obviously I am not playing one province off against another;  I
take it to apply directly to myself. To determine the value we  are  getting
from the schools system, we  can  compare  the  progress  of  South  African
pupils with those of some of our neighbours.

Analysis indicates that South African schools are twice  as  inefficient  as
those of Senegal and Zambia, yet those countries  are  significantly  poorer
than we are. In terms of international comparisons we  fare  poorly  at  all
levels. South African Grade 4 learners  have  amongst  the  worst  numeracy,
literacy and life skills in Africa.

Suid-Afrika ding nie net mee met Afrika nie, maar weens  die  aard  van  die
ekonomie vandag ding ons mee met die hele wêreld. [South Africa is not  only
competing against Africa, but because of the nature of the economy today  we
compete against the whole world.]

Why have we  achieved  these  poor  learning  outcomes?  Louise  Crouch  and
Mabogoane,  two  leading  education  policy  analysts,  concluded  that  the
difference in the performance of schools is to a very large  extent  due  to
the differences in  the  quality  of  their  management.  Nick  Taylor,  the
executive director of the Joint Education Trust, believes that  the  quality
of the management of a school may account for around 50%  of  the  variation
in learning outcomes across schools.  We  will  find  schools  in  the  same
community with the  same  poverty  indices,  with  very  different  learning
outcomes. This confirms  that,  above  a  rather  low  threshold,  providing
additional resources to a school will not  necessarily  result  in  improved
learning.

If it is true that the quality of management is such a major contributor  to
efficiency,  we  can  understand  why  the  significant  redistribution   of
resources in the schooling sector and across the provinces since the  advent
of democratic  rule  in  South  Africa  has  not  necessarily  improved  the
education opportunities of all of our children.

This money was initially  absorbed  entirely  in  hiring  new  teachers  and
increasing salaries. Between 1995-96 and 1998-99  expenditure  on  personnel
increased by 35%, while nonpersonnel expenditure decreased  by  almost  12%.
If the Crouch-Mabogoane model is correct,  then  the  hiring  of  additional
teachers would not have more than a marginal positive  effect  on  learning.
The fact that the additional appointments were made at the expense of  books
would be to  the  detriment  of  learning.  Budget  spending  on  books  and
stationery showed a real decline of 14%. [Time expired.]
Mev J WITBOOI: Agb  Voorsitter,  agb  Minister  en  agb  lede,  daar  is  in
Afrikaans 'n spreuk wat lui: ``Geld wat stom is, maak reg wat krom is.''  In
die Suid-Afrikaanse onderwysstelsel is daar baie kromhede  en  in  die  vier
minute tot my beskikking, wil  ek  net  na  'n  paar  aspekte  kyk.  Dit  is
belangrik om te verwys na die toename in die  onderwysbegroting  sedert  die
1995-96 boekjaar van R32 miljard tot die huidige R56 miljard. Steeds is  dit
nie genoeg om te vergoed vir die vermindering van die koopkrag van die  rand
nie, met negatiewe gevolge in sekere sektore van ons onderwys.

Die nuwe kurrikulum is gebaseer op die  veronderstelling  dat  elke  leerder
genoegsame toegang tot hulpmiddele sal  hê.  Daar  is  nie  genoeg  geld  om
hierdie aspek van onderrig aan te spreek nie. Ons  doen  'n  beroep  op  die
Minister dat daar opnuut gekyk sal word na die beskikbaarstel  van  geld  om
die hulpmiddele wat skole, en veral ons arm skole so broodnodig het, aan  te
skaf. 'n Kind  se  grondslag  moet  reg  gelê  word.  'n  Stewige  fondament
verseker 'n blink toekoms. Waarom sal ons toelaat dat ons  onderwysbegroting
voorskoolse onderrig soveel onreg aandoen? Wanneer en hoe gaan ons  hiervoor
vergoed? Geld wat stom is, maak reg wat krom is.

Daar is 'n verbetering in ons matriekuitslae landswyd en ons hoop van  harte
dat die tendens ook hierdie  jaar  sal  voortduur.  Op  die  vakgebiede  van
wiskunde en wetenskap is daar enorme kromhede. Ek staan om te pleit dat  ons
in hierdie spesifieke vakrigtings meer geld beskikbaar sal  stel  sodat  ons
manne en vroue sal voorberei vir die mededingende wêreld daar buite.

In 1999 het  die  Minister  van  Onderwys  belowe  om  binne  vyf  jaar  die
agterstand wat daar in die veld van volwasse basiese onderrig  bestaan,  uit
te roei. Dit is nog 'n kromheid, waarvoor geld wat stom  is,  bewillig  moet
word - anders sal dit bloot 'n belofte bly.

'n Ander groot leemte in die  onderwysstelsel  is  die  gebrek  aan  kennis,
insig en  ondervinding  aan  die  kant  van  personeel  in  sekere  van  ons
provinsiale    departemente.    Dit     bring     mee     dat     belangrike
ondersteuningsmateriaal vir onderwys  nie  betyds,  indien  ooit,  by  skole
afgelewer word. Die aanstelling van geskikte  personeel  moet  saamgaan  met
doeltreffende opleidingsprogramme. Geld  moet  gebruik  word  vir  die  doel
waarvoor dit aangevra word. Daar is ook 'n Engelse  spreuk  wat  lui:  ``Put
your money, where your mouth is.'' Kom ons doen dit  nou.  Daar  is  nog  te
veel kromhede. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mrs J WITBOOI: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, in  Afrikaans
there is a saying that goes: ``Geld wat stom is,  maak  reg  wat  krom  is''
[Beauty is potent, but money is omnipotent]. In the South African  education
system there are many problem areas and in the four minutes at  my  disposal
I want to look at a few aspects. It is important to make  reference  to  the
increase in the education budget since the 1995-96 financial year, from  R32
billion to the current R56 billion. It is still not enough to  make  up  for
the reduced purchasing power of the rand, with negative results  in  certain
sectors of our education.

The new curriculum is based on the supposition that each learner would  have
adequate access to resources. There is insufficient  money  to  handle  this
aspect of education. We appeal to the Minister to take a new look at  making
money available for purchasing resources that are so desperately  needed  by
schools, especially our poor schools. A  child's  foundation  must  be  laid
correctly. A solid foundation ensures a bright future. Why should  we  allow
our education budget to do pre-school education  such  injustice?  When  and
how are we going to compensate for this? Beauty  is  potent,  but  money  is
omnipotent.

There is an improvement in our matric results countrywide and we  hope  with
all our hearts that the trend will continue this year. In  the  subjects  of
mathematics and science there are enormous problems. I am standing  here  to
appeal that we should spend more money on these specific areas of  study  so
that we would prepare men and women for the competitive world out there.

In 1999 the Minister of Education promised to eradicate the backlog  in  the
area of basic adult education within five years. This is  still  a  problem,
for which omnipotent money must be appropriated - or it would merely  remain
a promise.

Another major shortcoming in our education system is the lack of  knowledge,
insight and experience on the part of personnel in  certain  departments  in
our provinces. This causes the late or nondelivery of important  educational
support materials to schools. The appointment  of  suitable  staff  must  go
hand in hand with efficient training programmes. Money must be used for  the
purpose for which it is requested. There is  also  an  English  saying  that
goes: ``Put your money where your mouth is.'' Let us do this now. There  are
still too many problem areas. [Applause.]]

Ms J  MASHAMBA:(Northern  Province):  Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon
Deputy Minister and the House at large, it is indeed a great  honour  to  us
as the Northern Province's department of education  to  have  been  afforded
the opportunity to come and share with the House our perspectives on  a  few
issues.

Although  we  agree  that  the  1994  elections  constituted  the   decisive
qualitative break with the past, we dare not  relax  and  say  that  all  is
over. We say that the education struggle must  continue.  As  we  celebrated
that breakthrough we knew too well that although apartheid was dead  we  had
not disposed of it. In fact, in death apartheid had become more onerous  and
ubiquitous. We knew that although we had witnessed the birth  of  democracy,
we had not yet fully really achieved it. In  its  birth,  democracy  had  in
fact become more nebulous and fragile.

We come here to hold hands with  members  to  continue  with  the  education
struggle until the doors of learning and culture are  indeed  open.  We  are
not surprised that when one touches anything regarding apartheid, one  hears
people making a noise.  One  is  reminding  them  of  the  past  and  it  is
difficult. They had better toe the line, because those days are over.
We shall highlight certain commendable achievements  by  the  department  of
education in the Northern Province within the past years  and  indicate  how
we intend to carry forward the transformation of our education system.

We say that it is commendable in our view that the department has been  able
to integrate the various  racial  and  ethnic  educational  systems  into  a
single, nonracial, nonsexist and democratic  education  system  without  any
earth-shattering hiccups. This is not to say that it was all plain  sailing.
No, there has been resistance from all quarters, especially from  right-wing
communities and individuals. However, these occurrences have been  more  the
exception than the rule.

The redeployment of educators has been a hard nut to crack,  but  tremendous
progress has been made. But there is no denying that  at  the  moment  there
are many qualified educators who are  unemployed.  However,  in  most  cases
their qualifications are not relevant to either the needs of our schools  or
those of the national economy. We are, however, doing all we can to  redress
this situation.

We will soon embark on a  process  of  empowering  and  reorientating  these
teachers to  play  a  critical  positive  role  in  the  reconstruction  and
development of our country, in  line  with  the  new  national  Government's
Integrated  Rural  Development  Strategy  and  the  National  Department  of
Education  programme  to  turn  our  schools  into  centres  for   community
development. It is for this reason that we have decided to accept a  teacher
corps from Cuba, not because, as it was  rumoured,  we  intend  to  retrench
South African teachers, but because we want these Cuban teachers to help  us
produce teachers who will be relevant to the demands of our times.

We are also happy to report  that  we  have  taken  a  decision  to  provide
adequate infrastructure to our schools. We  have  first  targeted  the  most
needy, starting with  those  schools  where  we  still  have  classes  being
conducted under trees. We are doing everything in our  power  to  make  sure
that this is not just an empty promise.
We think that, together with our communities and  those  magnanimous  enough
to donate funds for this purpose, we  shall  manage  to  have  provided  the
necessary infrastructure to all the needy schools  in  the  not  so  distant
future. To improve  the  performance  of  our  schools  at  all  levels  and
particularly at matric level, we will continue to  intensify  the  programme
that we put in place last year.

I do not want to say that although we are so determined to do all  this,  we
do not have impediments on our way. Through the Minmec and  the  submissions
to our provincial treasury,  the  department  has  already  highlighted  the
financial problems facing it. If all  expenditure  items  are  to  be  fully
funded, the department will require a further R500  million.  The  breakdown
is as follows: LSM is R220 million, Abet is R50 000, the Skills Levy is  R66
million and personnel promotion posts are R156 000. In 2003-04  this  figure
will  in  all  likelihood  rise  as  a  result  of   the   Curriculum   2005
implementation. The Northern Province will need R166 million for this.
On the infrastructure issue, the department is working with Public Works  to
ensure that the full annual allocation is spent. The department's budget  is
R181 million for 2002-03, which  is  an  increase  of  50%  on  the  current
allocation. Although classrooms are the major indicators, services  such  as
water, sanitation and electricity also have huge  backlogs.  The  department
is working together with Water Affairs and foreign donors to  address  these
problems.

Once more, we all know where we come from. We all know where we are  and  we
all know where we are getting to. Nothing is  going  to  deter  us.  We  are
going to do all we can to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  our  people.
[Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, hon Minister of Education, hon Deputy Minister  of
Finance, hon MECs  from  the  provinces,  hon  special  delegates  and  dear
colleagues, equity, parity,  quality  and  all  those  positive  words  that
describe  a  just  dispensation  were  distinctly  absent   in   a   society
characterised by the imperative of apartheid - a  word  that  was  really  a
poor euphemism for racial discrimination and subjugation.

One can therefore fully comprehend the enormity of  the  task  inherited  by
the new democratic Government seven years ago, when, at long last and  after
many centuries of neglect of the greater number of its citizens, it  had  to
address the questions of access to affordable,  quality  services  for  more
and more South Africans.

When one surveys the apartheid landscape, one  sees  that  the  hallmark  of
education was the Bantu Education Act of 1953, one  of  the  most  obnoxious
pieces of legislation ever written in the statute  books  of  South  African
legislation. When it was introduced in  this  very  Parliament,  by  one  Dr
Hendrik Verwoerd, sole inspiration of the apartheid philosophy and a  failed
sculptor of human destiny, he declared in high-pitched staccato  tones  that
there was no place for the black  man  in  European  society  above  certain
forms of labour. It was this piece of legislation that set the tone for  the
denial of access to good and wholesome education for  generations  of  black
South Africans.

Ministers of education in a  democratic  state  have  the  unenviable  task,
almost insurmountable,  of  turning  education  around.  The  road  to  this
destination has  unfortunately  not  been  paved  with  gold.  The  national
Minister, who is well known for his penchant to take the bull by the  horns,
will not allow such  impediments  as  tight  resource  constraints  or  weak
management or unacceptably high numbers of poorly trained teachers  or  even
recalcitrant  councils  of  higher  education  institutions  to  impede  his
Ministry's inexorable progress towards equity, quality  and  a  skills  base
commensurate with the needs of a global economy.

A cursory reading of the  IGFR  chapter  on  education  gives  an  objective
analyst's confirmation of the view that the Education Ministry,  though  far
from singing, ``My troubles are over,'' has nevertheless  extricated  itself
from the quite untenable  situation  that  existed  during  the  last  seven
years. We applaud the Minister and will continue to do so in  his  sustained
efforts to establish greater stability in education. It would be  naive  not
to acknowledge that education is being turned around.

In his informative prelude to the IGFR on education on 12 October 2001,  the
hon the Minister was candid in admitting, like Ulysses of old,  that  though
much has been done, much abides: the challenges of poverty,  the  challenges
of the incidence  of  HIV/Aids,  the  challenges  of  bringing  bureaucratic
management to controllable levels, the training of  middle  management,  the
spending of funds  to  improve  infrastructure,  and  more  importantly,  to
ensure that maintenance of existing infrastructure is equally  critical  and
vital if new levels of stability are to be achieved.

It must, however, be admitted that, by and large, it is the provincial  MECs
who are ultimately  responsible  for  the  development  and  maintenance  of
infrastructure. Unfortunately, in my province, KZN, the constant changes  in
the appointment of the MEC for education have stalled  progress  in  meeting
the challenges of good management and delivery of services. There  seems  to
be an inordinate delay in the  appointment  of  the  superintendent-general.
One can understand the frustration of the  national  Minister  of  Education
when he correctly called for a greater will and determination  to  be  shown
by  political  superiors  in  the  different  provincial  departments.  Good
management is absolutely crucial to ensure that priorities in education  are
realised.

We all agree that no child should be learning under a tree. No child  should
be denied fresh water and electricity. No child should be deprived of  basic
learning materials. No child should go hungry  in  school.  The  failure  of
school feeding schemes, the  shortage  of  school  learning  materials,  the
selling of textbooks by every butcher, barber and baker continue to mar  the
physiognomy of our education. The MECs must  certainly  take  responsibility
for all such shortcomings and become  proactive  in  initiating  efforts  to
eradicate them.

Mr Z P TOLO (North West): Chairperson,  Deputy  Minister,  hon  Minister  of
Education, hon members, the  Department  of  education  in  the  North  West
province appreciates the work behind the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review.
The type of information and analysis provided in this piece of work is  very
instructive and indeed helpful in pointing the way forward, assisting us  in
reflecting on expenditure patterns over the past seven years or so. We  take
it as an important reflection and a mirror to assist us. We are  very  proud
that we are  currently  involved  in  one  of  the  most  important  service
delivery projects, namely the provision of education.

Though education still remains in some respects  underfunded,  the  type  of
budget allocation that we get is indeed very  helpful  in  assisting  us  to
address especially the challenges inherited from the  apartheid  government.
Education transformation is  currently  under  way,  and  I  would  like  to
mention that a lot of work is being done in  achieving  this  objective.  We
are  indeed  living  through  very  exciting  events  in  dealing  with  the
transformation of the education of our children in the country.

I would like to commend in particular the point raised in  the  report  with
regard to HIV/Aids, because if we cannot deal with  this  monster  which  is
currently creeping into our schools and our society, we will indeed have  no
one to teach and no one to be taught not long from today.  Therefore  it  is
important that resources be made available and a greater effort be  made  to
deal with this monster.

In the beginning  the  question  of  rationalisation  and  the  redeployment
processes within the Department of Education were very  important  and  very
difficult. I would like to say to the House that though we  talk  of  excess
educators we should, in fact, refer to these educators as  being  excess  to
the budget. The need for personnel is still felt in our  schools  and  needs
to be addressed.

We still need counselling officers in our schools to deal  with  the  trauma
young people experience due to various incidents that take place  on  school
premises, and we still need sports  administrators  and  educators  who  can
assist children in curriculum redress and to address  issues  such  as  arts
and culture.

The situation in farm schools needs urgent attention. Plans  are  being  put
in place. What is needed is to  direct  more  resources  to  deal  with  the
situation  in  our  farm  schools.  Farm  schools  in  South  Africa  are  a
reflection  of  where  we  come  from.  They  reflect  the  negligence  that
prevailed under the apartheid government. It is a pity that Ms Zille is  not
here, because she would have clearly understood, if she cared to  hear,  the
difficulties we experience in addressing the situation,  especially  in  our
farm schools.

Another important issue raised by the  report  is  the  decline  in  learner
enrolment. It is true that we have  experienced  a  pattern  of  decline  in
learner enrolment. We intend to take advantage of the situation  and  direct
resources properly in order to close the gap that has developed as a  result
of this.

The drop in learner enrolment will  afford  us  an  opportunity  to  address
curriculum redress within  the  school  situation.  We  will  intensify  the
reskilling of our teachers through in-service training.  We  will  be  in  a
position  to  provide  more  resources  like  learner  support  and   better
equipment  in  the  classrooms,  and  we  will  also  increase  the  average
expenditure per learner within the school system.

One of the critical challenges facing us currently is the need to  introduce
information technology. In the previous century we  talked  about  the  21st
century being the century of information technology. We therefore  say  that
this new challenge seeks to ask that whatever resources may be saved  during
implementation should be directed  towards  information  technology  in  our
schools.

In terms of creating infrastructure, which  is  much  more  needed,  we  all
agree, at all levels, that no learner should attend  school  under  a  tree.
All our learners, all our children, must be afforded better facilities  that
will enable proper learning and teaching to take place.

In the North West province we have  established  the  North  West  Education
Development Trust. Jointly with the private sector we are able  to  mobilise
resources. All these resources  are  directed  towards  creating  the  much-
needed, suitable and comfortable infrastructure for our children.

We have also gone a long  way  in  providing  laboratory  equipment.  I  can
announce here that all our schools in  the  North  West  province,  starting
with the rural schools, have been provided with laboratory  equipment.  This
is intended to improve the performance of our children in science  subjects,
which have proved to be very difficult in the past.

The transformation of education  remains  one  of  the  greatest  challenges
facing us. Those of us who  are  involved  with  this  task  at  grass-roots
level, at the level of implementation, say it is a very exciting moment.  We
are grappling with all the challenges facing us. [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy  Minister  of  Finance,
hon colleagues, hon MECs from the provinces, under the ANC Government  South
Africa has made enormous progress in turning education around.

This has proved to be an arduous  task,  as  apartheid  denied  millions  of
blacks  access  to  equal  and  quality  education.  The  transformation  of
education is about equity, quality  and  a  skills  base  adaptable  to  the
demands of the global economy. All this has to be achieved in a  context  of
weak management  experience,  tight  resource  constraints,  poorly  trained
teachers and a culture in which learning has fallen by the wayside.

Initiated in 1999,  the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  has  become  the
barometer of provincial and local governmental fiscal trends. Not only  does
it inform us on the trends in spending and revenue,  but  it  also  supports
our committee  in  its  assessment  and  debates  on  the  critical  aspects
pertaining to delivery.

The review emphasises the department's significant  consolidation  over  the
last five years, specifically transformation balanced against the  need  for
universal access, greater equity and improved quality. This is well  managed
through co-operative governance.

What is of particular significance is  that,  in  terms  of  the  historical
spending trends since the 1996-97 financial year,  when  education  spending
went up by 22% in real terms, there has been a 2,4% decline between  1997-98
and 2001. This can be ascribed to a variety of factors, for example  teacher
rationalisation, improved financial management, greater powers  being  given
to parents in the managing  of  schools  and  the  launch  of  the  Tirisano
campaign. This has resulted in a much more stable education system in  which
budgets are more balanced and sustainable.

While we continue to face serious challenges, we are beginning  to  see  the
benefits arising from our efforts to turn our education system around.  This
is  evident  in  our  spending-per-learner  average,  which   is   currently
estimated to  be  R3 658.  I  hope  Antoinette  is  listening.  The  average
spending per learner is the highest in the Northern Cape,  Gauteng  and  the
Western Cape, whereas in KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape  and  the  Northern
Province, spending is among the lowest. These  disparities  can  largely  be
attributed to the disparities in enrolment rates, the cost of  teachers  and
other priorities.

Poorer provinces are encouraged to work harder in this regard.  However,  we
would urge the department to consider these  factors  when  allocations  are
made to these provinces and find ways to bridge these gaps.

The teacher-learner ratio has declined in all provinces,  from  33,7  to  an
acceptable 32,7. Antoinette must note that. However, in some  provinces  the
classroom-pupil ratio is still significantly high due  to  excess  teachers.
For example, the  Northern  Province  has  an  oversupply  of  teachers  and
undersupply of classrooms. During the public  hearing  this  was  one  thing
that was brought up. We believe that this problem can be  addressed  through
a human resource strategy to ensure that the various  education  departments
work  together  in  a  co-ordinated  way.  Since  1996,  about  25  102  new
classrooms have been built. A  significant  increase  in  the  provision  of
telephones, sanitation, running water and electricity  can  be  reported.  I
hope our achievements are also noted.

What is of particular concern is the decline in the  physical  condition  of
our schools. For example, the amount of schools requiring  repairs  went  up
from 10 500 to 12 100 and those classified as weak from  3  000  to  7  000.
What is encouraging is that the number of schools  with  computers  went  up
from 2 241 to 6 581. As an achievement, this is enormous  progress.  I  want
to mention that those who usually say that we do  not  deliver  as  the  ANC
Government should start to learn that we are moving forward.

Crime has also caused provinces a loss of R155 million  in  the  year  2000,
with 2 540 burglaries. Five thousand assault cases were reported,  of  which
1 860 were serious crimes. We believe,  in  this  regard,  that  communities
could play a meaningful role by taking ownership of schools and that  school
governing bodies can also greatly contribute.

The matric results for  the  year  2000  were,  on  the  whole,  impressive.
However, the number of candidates not passing  mathematics  and  science  is
cause for concern. A major cause of concern is the  low  number  of  females
taking up these subjects. There is also  growing  concern  that  the  female
child learner is still experiencing discrimination, which  is  reflected  in
the levels of high school dropouts. This  problem  is  compounded  by  these
learners having to travel to school over long distances, resulting in  their
being exploited by bus and taxi  drivers.  We  therefore  propose  that  the
provincial departments take a serious look at the possibility  of  providing
safety nets for these learners.

The review admits that a great deal of improvement has been  made  in  terms
of delivery in education, which we endorse without reservation.  However,  a
number of challenges remain, for example, the shortage  of  learner  support
material, insufficient transport, inadequate ablution  facilities  at  rural
schools, a shortage of suitably qualified  teachers  in  certain  provinces,
and a lack of mathematical and scientific literacy.

What is actually of major concern is the extent to which  bureaucratic  tape
and poor financial management systems hamper  delivery  in  some  provinces.
Moreover,  the  slow  procurement  and  distribution  of   learner   support
materials and annual roll-overs in budgets leave a lot to be desired.

In  conclusion,  Antoinette,  the  success  achieved  in   stabilising   the
education system ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon member, I wish to  remind  you  that
we do not refer to  members  by  first  name  in  the  House.  It  would  be
appropriate to refer to ``the hon member'' and a surname if  necessary,  but
not the first names of members. We do not do that.

Mr D M KGWARE: Thank you, Chairperson. In conclusion, the  success  achieved
in stabilising the education  system  and  in  improving  management  should
provide accelerated enhancement in the quality of schooling. [Applause.]

Mr C N  M  PADAYACHEE  (Mpumalanga):  Chairperson,  Minister  of  Education,
Deputy Minister of Finance, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, it is  common
knowledge that the previous regime left us with an  education  system  laden
with a daunting variety of backlogs as millions of our  people  were  denied
access  to  decent  and  quality  education.  However,   the   ninety-degree
turnaround we have  managed  to  achieve  within  a  very  short  period  is
attested to by  the  expenditure  patterns  reflected  in  the  IGF  review,
including the education of many adults who were previously denied the  right
to education.

I take for granted hon members' profound knowledge of the  funding  patterns
of the provincial education department in Mpumalanga  over  the  past  three
financial years. At face value  there  is  a  discernible  increase  in  the
budget allocation, whilst in real terms this represents a decline  of  about
0,5%.

If I may refer to the period 1999-2000,  education  received  43,1%  of  the
equitable share for provincial expenditure, of  which  R14  million  was  on
conditional grants. For the financial  year  2000-01,  42,8%  was  received,
with the same amount on conditional grants. If a variety of other  important
factors such as salary adjustments, severance  packages  and  the  inflation
rate are not taken into  account  this  surely  may  be  misconstrued  as  a
substantially significant increase  of  6,6%  from  the  overall  provincial
budget allocation.

However, despite the situation, there have been notable developments,  which
have positively and qualitatively accelerated the transformation agenda  for
education provisioning. Financial management has  improved.  Greater  equity
was achieved in the deployment of educators, and personnel costs  are  being
brought  down.  For  instance,  in  1999-2000  the  total  actual  personnel
expenditure was 92%, whereas for the current financial year 98% is  budgeted
for personnel costs. We are determined to ensure  strict  adherence  to  the
national ratio of 85  to  15,  a  budgetary  guideline  recommended  by  the
Financial and Fiscal Commission. Next year's budget will see us  reduce  our
personnel costs to 87%, and the year thereafter to 85%.

As there is everywhere in the country, there are, however, serious  physical
infrastructure backlogs, which are still hampering  effective  learning  and
teaching. An amount of R107 million has been  earmarked  for  infrastructure
development for the financial year 2002-03 to bring  much-needed  relief  to
the majority of our learners. This represents  32%  more  than  the  current
financial year, and 186% more than the previous financial year.

Also, as a result of the increased learner enrolment  over  the  past  years
seen against a backdrop of serious backlogs  in  classroom  provisioning,  4
000 classrooms must urgently be provided  in  the  province.  This  was  not
catered for after 1994, and is  due  to  the  previous  system  wherein  the
majority of people were denied proper building facilities.  [Interjections.]


Obviously, this will  happen  within  integrated  development  planning,  in
conjunction with the relevant authorities, for the proper  determination  of
areas of critical need, taking into account  social  movement  patterns,  as
well as the development of new residential settlements.

The province is also looking at alternative  funding  methods  in  order  to
speed  up  the  delivery  of  classrooms  that  are  so  needed.  The   2001
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review document indicates  that  in  1996  only  49
schools indicated that they had critical  classroom  shortages,  whereas  in
2000, 59 schools indicated shortages. However, since  1997  many  classrooms
have  been  built.  For  instance,  in  the  financial  year  1998-99,   332
classrooms were built; and in 1999-2000, 420 classrooms were  built.  As  we
speak now for this year, 420 classrooms, including  toilets  and  so  forth,
are being constructed.

As we continue striving to provide  adequate  learning  facilities,  we  are
acutely conscious of the plight of the learners in farm schools.

Scholar transport is a critical and most pivotal area of need that  requires
redress. Towards meeting this basic need for these learners,  my  department
has, in terms of actual expenditure, spent R7,2 million  for  the  financial
year 2000-01 and R8,2 million  for  the  year  2001-02,  and  for  the  next
financial year R13,5 million will be  allocated  for  this  purpose.  As  an
indication of my department's commitment to deal with  this  challenge,  the
expenditure for the two latter financial years has increased by 100%.

Our budget allocation and expenditure  trends  towards  the  procurement  of
learners' support material for schools are showing a  steady  increase.  For
instance, the expenditure for 2000-01 was R60 million  for  2001-02  it  was
more than R68,5 million, and for  next  year  it  will  be  more  than  R100
million.

As I speak now, stationery for all schools in Mpumalanga  has  already  been
delivered in preparation for next year's learning. Underlying these  efforts
is my department's commitment to create  a  conducive  environment  for  the
decisive delivery of qualitative and  efficient  teaching  and  learning  to
take place.

Amongst  our  priorities,  we  will  continue  with   the   development   of
professional quality educators, ensuring the success of the active  learning
process through outcomes-based education, the creation of a vibrant  further
education and  training  system,  breaking  the  back  of  adult  and  youth
illiteracy, urgently and purposefully dealing with the  HIV/Aids  emergency,
and eliminating the backlog in infrastructure.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon Padayachee,  I  would  have  thought
that members would  applaud  you  at  the  point  where  you  announced  the
delivery of textbooks and other materials. I hope  that  it  does  not  mean
that hon members  wish  to  go  and  check  the  storerooms  of  Mpumalanga.
[Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, members of the NCOP, and members  of
the executive councils who are here, I  wish  to  begin  by  commending  the
National Treasury, through  the  Deputy  Minister,  for  the  very  valuable
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review of 2001. On 12 October I participated  in  a
very lively and useful  hearing  on  this  review  with  the  NCOP's  Select
Committee on Finance, which was ably conducted by  the  chairperson  of  the
standing committee, and it was a pleasure to meet him for  the  first  time,
and, of course, my old friend the hon Mr Kgware.

The discussions and questions  today  are  equally  useful.  Members  should
remember that this is a very interesting constitutional device that we  were
discussing. I think it is to the credit of the Treasury and  our  democratic
order. But today we are looking at the policy aspects of  expenditure.  This
attests  to  the  success  of  the  publication  in  facilitating  effective
parliamentary   oversight   on   Government's   policies,   budgeting    and
expenditure. This is quite  different  from  the  portfolio  committees  and
standing committees. Those are, rather, fairly incestuous bodies, if  I  may
say so. It is very important that  we  should  come  to  the  House  itself,
because we should not be talking about education by  just  talking  to  each
other only.

I think that the general political oversight  is  important,  so  I  welcome
this opportunity to respond to the questions posed in this  debate.  I  will
deal with the matters covered by the review. I would be very  excited  if  I
had to look at other issues, but I think that  it  is  the  review  that  is
under scrutiny.

I do this secure in the knowledge that the review  confirms  very  important
achievements of the Government in the area of education and training in  the
country since 1994. One of the extremely notable  achievements  is  that  we
can now confidently say  that  we  have  turned  a  corner  with  regard  to
provincial education expenditure trends. Problems associated with  the  very
sharp increase in provincial expenditure in 1996-97 have  been  dealt  with.
In the past, I have  mentioned  in  this  House  the  dire  effects  of  the
overexpenditure and the cutbacks that took place, in what is  known  as  the
incidental  areas  of  early  childhood  education,  specialist   education,
literacy, and Abet, and the devastating effects on those areas.

We did this through discipline, hard work, leadership and support.  In  this
regard, I want to reiterate my appreciation for the efforts  and  leadership
displayed by the provincial  education  MECs  and  the  much  condemned  and
maligned provincial MECs of finance also.

But I want to say very clearly, particularly to  the  deniers  and  critics,
that the quality of education in South Africa in the last eight  years,  for
the vast majority of our people, has improved to a considerable  extent.  As
for those who had privileged access to the former Model  C  schools,  nobody
said that the position had deteriorated. Of course, what  we  have  had  are
higher school fees, because their parents or governing  bodies  insisted  on
getting additional staff. But for the vast majority of our  people,  though,
in the rural areas and in the townships,  the  provision  of  better  school
facilities, for the first time, learning materials and computers -  we  will
come to these in a moment - especially in the primary schools  in  order  to
cater for the first postapartheid generation of kids  have  all  been  major
improvements. These had enormous effects on them. So we must  not  subscribe
to  this   propagandist   nonsense   that   everything   had   deteriorated,
particularly in education. It is just not true. It is  one  of  those  great
political lies and distortions. It does not do good to  the  health  of  the
country.

As I said during the finance committee hearing, we are now  poised  to  reap
the fruits of success in stabilising the provincial education  expenditures.
The MTEF's projection shows that we can look  forward  to  improved  budgets
for education which will allow us to address the many pressures  that  arise
directly from a constitutional mandate for education. It  will  be  a  real,
not nominal improvement in the next year and the year after that.

The key areas of education mandate such as  infrastructure  development  and
maintenance; adult basic education, training and literacy;  early  childhood
development; and the supply of textbooks and  stationery  are  some  of  the
expenditure items that must receive urgent attention. I drew  the  attention
of the MECs in yesterday's meeting of the Council  of  Education  Ministers.
We shall hold them to the promise that they will give to us in  December  as
to when the books will be delivered and when they have been ordered.  And  I
will publish their statements about the promises  that  they  will  make  in
December, because we no longer can countenance children not receiving  their
books when schools begin. I will hold all the MECs  to  the  undertaking  as
made next month when the promises are given and the money is allocated.  And
I look forward to Mpumalanga's spending of R100 million next year.
Of course, we must improve service delivery and services  to  the  poor.  We
have developed complex mechanisms and institutions to  give  effect  to  the
notion of co-operative governance as stated in the Constitution. The  system
of  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  is  predicated   on   co-operative
governance. The priority to make co-operative governance work is in  no  way
more profound than those functions of  Government  such  as  education,  but
which are based on concurrent powers.

However, the integrity of Government's function to deliver on its  education
mandate  is  seriously  undermined  on  two  grounds.  The  first   one   is
inefficiency in some of the provinces, as in  relation  to  the  quality  of
education and expenditure of money; and, secondly, in a  province  like  the
Western Cape, every effort is made to ensure  that  provincial  perspectives
on priorities override national perspectives at the  expense  of  the  poor.
Let us not have this. This case for provincial autonomy is used  largely  to
affect the poor. I would like to tell the hon  Versfeld  not  to  shake  her
head, she should listen to these facts. They are there.

Regarding the education component, nationally, 41% of  the  block  grant  of
the provincial equitable share is given to the  provinces.  I  even  made  a
mistake, by the way, in 1994 by having  a  block  grant  because,  in  fact,
there is no control over the expenditure. Let us look at the  Western  Cape.
It has only spent approximately 34,9% out of  41%  allocated  for  the  2001
budget on education. This is  a  real  scandal.  This  is  the  lowest  when
compared to all other provinces and significantly lower  than  the  national
average of 39,3 %.

The hon Zille has apologised to me. Her premier - I do not know how long  he
will remain as premier - has called her back. [Laughter.] I think this is  a
shameful thing on the part of the premier to call someone  away  -  this  is
disrespect for this House - because she has  raised  very  important  points
which I want to reply to.

I think he owes it to the honour of this House that she be here. It  is  not
her fault. It is this provincial premier who may not be there  in  the  next
few weeks. [Laughter.]  But  judging  from  the  medium-term  estimates,  it
appears the Western Cape will spend an even smaller percentage on the  MTEF.
Now, I have no doubt that these trends,  coupled  with  the  Western  Cape's
profound dislike for poverty-targeted  strategies,  represent  a  threat  of
further hardship to the poor learners and families in this province.

The press are not here. She really is the darling  of  the  press,  the  hon
Zille, in the Western Cape. Let me say quite clearly that the  statement  by
Ms Zille that additional funds do not guarantee  education  success  is  not
true. One must go  round  the  country:  additional  funds  are  needed  for
laboratories. The vast majority of our schools do not have laboratories.  If
one provides the laboratories, their science results go up.

With regard  to  the  intervention  programmes,  the  Western  Cape  is  not
notorious  for  intervention  programmes  in  science  and  mathematics.  In
Gauteng and the Northern Province last year the intervention programmes  had
remarkable effects on matric  results  and  they  were  modest,  small-scale
intervention programmes. There are no literacy  programmes  as  the  Western
Cape does not allocate money to large-scale literacy programmes.

If one goes to other provinces one sees the extraordinary flowering  of  the
genius of 30-year-olds,  40-year-olds,  particularly  women.  Suddenly  they
acquire control over the environment. It is  not  true,  by  the  way,  that
money is not followed by improvement. It is a justification for the  Western
Cape going on the least served road  of  taking  money  from  education  and
putting it into this idea of job creation.

Job creation, obviously, is the advertisements one puts into  newspapers  as
to why one is honourably remaining as mayor of  the  city  council  of  Cape
Town. [Laughter.] This is an obstruction of national policies,  really.  But
did she ration expenditure here?
Our attempts, for example, deal with the abhorrent system of  initiation  in
education institutions, though the establishment of an effective  regulatory
mechanism is being frustrated by the Western  Cape's  continual  harping  on
about wanting more and more power at the national level.

Yesterday we received the Wessels report from the  Human  Rights  Commission
about the obscenity of initiation ceremonies. All  the  MECs  said  national
Government will have to pass regulatory  mechanisms.  And  these  newspapers
that adore the Western Cape MEC should note that,  rather  than  saying  uno
voce, uno duce  -  one  voice,  one  leader  -  that  is  what  the  DP  is.
[Laughter.] One voice, one leader! [Laughter.]  And  he  says  so.  He  said
yesterday. [Applause.] This is flouting the leader Prinzip. We do  not  have
a leader Prinzip in the ANC. I am free. I am free to say what I want.

Let me therefore come to something very important. I want to be quite  clear
to the NCOP, that we must succeed in improving the quality  of  spending.  I
would like to say with great respect to the hon Mashamba that she  will  not
get R500 million, from anywhere. The Northern  Cape  is  spending  less  and
less on education compared to 1994. In fact,  over  a  10-year  period,  the
province's spending would have fallen by 8%. It is for her to fight  in  the
province  for  more  allocations,  because  if  one  drops  expenditure   on
education, effectively one is affecting the poor.  That  is  the  effect  of
that.

It is for each MEC to contest the ground.  The  best  way  of  dealing  with
poverty is by education. The best way  of  dealing  with  all  the  areas  -
health, Aids and all - is by education. We must  have  better  capacity.  We
must  have  effective  education  management  bureaucracies.  Absolutely.  I
joined the hon Sizani  in  the  pain  he  felt  in  1994  when  we  saw  the
degradation. I remember as Minister of Water Affairs and  Forestry  in  that
suddenly we realised that 16 million people did not  have  water.  We  never
knew that before then.

It is not good enough for those two hon gentlemen, who  have  now  left,  to
say, ``Tell us something new'' and that they  never  knew  this.  So  it  is
always new for them, telling them again and again the shock we felt when  we
suddenly realised not only that there were two countries  in  South  Africa,
but that it was worse than that. There was  a  country  which  had  all  the
privileges and good life, and a country that had no hope.  Our  job  in  the
ANC was to put that hope into them. We have done it,  but  it  is  not  good
enough now, I say to the hon Sizani. It is not good enough now  to  rely  on
that. We must get efficiency  here.  For  instance,  schools  in  the  rural
areas, as I found yesterday,  are  in  a  dangerous  condition  -  a  really
dangerous condition. I saw  not  only  kids  under  the  trees,  but  actual
physical danger.

Therefore, I think, MECs must give greater political  direction,  with  some
passion, actually, to ensuring  that  these  degrading  conditions  are  not
there. We must make sure that things are used  effectively  to  ensure  that
the right of all learners to effective teaching is protected.

I want to say also to the hon Witbooi -  and  I  was  very  pleased  by  her
wonderful contribution today - that my intervention last time has  had  very
good results. [Laughter.] There was  a  little  shift.  Of  course  we  must
improve the maths and science results. Let me assure her that what  we  have
done in the last two or three months - and I want to assure Mr Kgware too  -
is that we have initiated a maths and science project, which will  focus  on
100 schools in  South  Africa.  The  project  is  being  launched  in  three
provinces today by the Deputy Minister. I deputed  the  Deputy  Minister  to
run this, and he has oversight responsibility for this.

We are going to target these 100 schools, which have been  chosen  from  all
over South Africa, to ensure that these schools will  benefit  from  special
intervention  programmes.  The  60  Cuban  instructors  are  in  fact  being
interviewed next week when a large delegation from  the  provinces  goes  to
Cuba. There is enormous enthusiasm in Cuba. However,  they  must  be  people
who meet our standards of English proficiency and mathematics proficiency.

So we are doing these kinds of things, and I am grateful to the hon  Witbooi
for raising this matter, because we must all be involved in this.

This has been a more than useful exercise. Again, I say that we are  on  the
route to doing things which no other country has been able to  do.  We  take
great pride in our 100% enrolment rate of school entry. We must, of  course,
work harder to ensure that they  stay  in  school.  Secondly,  we  are  very
pleased that the technical college system, which is not referred to  in  the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review, will be totally recast.  Thirdly,  we  move
next year to the  further  education  and  general  education  and  training
certificate. This will be very important, because it will point the  way  to
our young people that there is a life beyond academic learning  by  rote  in
the matric examination. There are  other  opportunities  open  to  our  kids
there.

Most important of all, which we could not discuss here, is that there  is  a
fundamental change in the value system of education. People  forget  this  -
that the education system the minority inherited in  South  Africa  was  not
the best in the world. As I have said to hon members  before,  my  standards
do not come from apartheid, which was racist and patronising.  My  standards
are because of exile. They come from other countries  which  had  democratic
assumptions, which dealt with human rights and fundamental freedoms.

I think the merging of the different traditions of our  state  schools  will
show, especially to the private sector, that we can really  create  a  South
African education system. To do that, of course,  we  need  more  resources,
which are coming. However, most important of all, as we showed this  weekend
when we had this excellent conference on  teacher  development  and  teacher
education, the whole teaching system must be based on a new kind of  teacher
to serve the needs of a much more complex society, whose values do not  come
from Big Brother, by the way, but come from the Constitution,  whose  values
do not come from the insolence and the crudity of Big Brother, but from  the
much more fundamental values that drove us in our liberation struggle.
I hope, therefore, that our educational system  itself  will  reflect  that.
Thank you very much, Chairperson,  for  this  opportunity  to  address  you.
[Applause.]

Ms N C KONDLO (Eastern Cape): Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,  MECs  from  the
different provinces, members  of  this  House,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  the
Department  of  Social  Development,  and  the  Eastern  Cape  province   in
particular, mentioned the critical areas that need an injection in terms  of
financial resources in the committee meeting two weeks  ago.  The  areas  of
concern that we raised in  those  meetings,  we  believe,  will  assist  the
province of the Eastern Cape in particular and the  department  in  general,
in terms of delivering more effectively on its mandate.

The focus of those areas, if closely examined, is  in  fact  about  fighting
poverty and having self-reliant people. Coming closer  to  the  province  of
the Eastern Cape, the provincial priorities that  were  identified  and  the
subsequent budgeting to  that  effect,  clearly  indicate  our  focus  as  a
province  on  social  service  delivery,  that  is,  health,   welfare   and
education.

As provinces, we  carry  more  responsibilities  in  terms  of  implementing
policies, whose formulation resides nationally.  If  the  responsibility  of
implementing these policies resides at a provincial level, then in terms  of
the vertical split this should be reflected as such. But, if  one  looks  at
table 1.1 of the IGFR 2000-01, the actual vertical split for  provinces  was
58.4% during the financial year 1999-2000, and for the financial year  2000-
01, it  has  gone  down  to  56.4%,  indeed  reflecting  a  decrease,  which
contradicts the responsibilities that the provinces have  to  carry,  if  we
talk in terms of implementing policy.  If  this  vertical  fiscal  imbalance
continues it will have serious implications for the  implementation  of  our
policies, the more so when we look at the tax base of  provinces,  which  is
far more compact than that of the national Government.

Policy formulation poses financial challenges for provinces in general,  and
for social development in particular. Policies driven by  other  departments
often have a direct bearing on social development, hence the  importance  of
balanced budgeting on such crosscutting policies.  It  is  for  this  reason
that we believe, and propose, that  there  should  be  some  policy  funding
mechanism that has to be put in place to address these issues.

In our endeavour as a province, and as a department in particular,  we  once
more want to indicate our commitment, as we did in the  committee.  We  also
want to highlight some of the challenges that we raised that  we  are  faced
with, which we referred to as cost pressures for the coming financial  year.
The chairperson has spoken about all these  issues:  HIV/Aids,  panels,  the
rising child support grant, etc.

We believe that amongst other issues that should be  dealt  with,  regarding
our province in particular, are the human resource challenges  that  we  are
faced with, in terms both of recruitment and of the retention of  personnel.
As an example: as we speak today, the current ratio  of  social  workers  in
the Eastern Cape is 1:26 000 people, as opposed  to  the  expected  norm  of
1:5 000. This situation impacts negatively on the service delivery  that  is
related to social development.

Since the delinking process and  the  establishment  of  the  department  of
welfare it has been operating from  prefabs,  or  temporary  structures,  as
well as containers donated by  Transnet.  This  has  a  serious  bearing  on
access to those offices in general, because many of the people that we  deal
with are people with disabilities. This lack of infrastructure is  not  only
evident in the  welfare  department;  at  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs
offices the situation might even be worse.

For many of our communities, access remains a task  that  has  to  be  dealt
with  head-on,  both  provincially  and  nationally.   Paypoints   in   many
communities are nonexistent. Whilst we believe that the norms and  standards
will indeed address some of these problems, the question  of  budgeting  for
those nationally driven policies will definitely make a difference in  terms
of the realisation of some of these policies. Some of  the  other  problems,
or cost pressures, are as a result of the lack in  the  areas  that  I  have
touched on.

Regarding the transformation of  welfare  services,  the  80:20  average  on
expenditure which the department expects is something that  we  are  working
hard at achieving. Indeed, the average for the past  three  financial  years
has been between 93:7 and 92:8. This must be  coupled  with  the  province's
own objective factors: to name but two, the fact that the province  is  poor
and the fact that the levels of unemployment are high.

The major challenge for all of us is  an  integrated  approach  to  all  our
actions,  from  formulation  of  policy  to  budgeting,  from  budgeting  to
implementation and from implementation to monitoring. By so doing,  we  will
see the impact of our policies  in  terms  of  changing  the  lives  of  our
people. An integrated approach has three simple, but  critical,  aspects  to
it. These are things like planning together,  intra-  and  interdepartmental
communication, the interconnectivity of our IT  systems  between  government
departments and the co-ordination of our  activities.  We  believe  that  if
more effort can be put in in those areas, at all levels  of  government,  we
will definitely see the change in terms of the impact we want to  see  where
we put our money.

Lastly, regarding Chapter 5 of the IGFL report, we,  as  the  department  of
welfare in the province, want it to be noted by the National  Treasury  that
there is  some  information  that  was  not  necessarily  reflected  in  the
document itself, and for record purposes we  wish  this  information  to  be
captured so that it is available for further reading and reference.

Xa ndiza kuhlala phantsi,  ndiyafuna  kwakhona,  njengeSebe  eMpuma  Koloni,
sivumelane nayo ngokupheleleyo  ingxelo  kwisahluko  5  ngokuphathelele  ...
[Before I sit down, I want us, as a  department  in  the  Eastern  Cape,  to
agree fully with Chapter 5 of the report which is about ...]

... what is referred to as the key financial management challenges  that  we
are faced with as social development in general. But indeed  many  of  those
financial management challenges are challenges that we  are  faced  with  in
the province of the Eastern Cape. We are doing a lot of  work  in  terms  of
addressing some of those challenges. [Applause.]

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, please could I get  clarification?  I  was  under
the impression that we were going to deal  with  social  development  first.
[Interjections.] Very well.

Hon Minister, MECs, special delegates and members, it is  indeed  an  honour
and pleasure to once  more  address  hon  members  on  this  ground-breaking
occasion of the debate on Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review,  tabled  by  the
Minister of Finance two weeks ago. For the  first  time,  provinces  had  an
opportunity to engage  on  this  document  in  a  meaningful  way  that  can
contribute to the budget process.

In the hearings that preceded this debate, officials from the Treasury,  the
relevant government  departments  and  we,  as  lawmakers  at  national  and
provincial level,  interacted  on  the  priorities  that  we  have  set  for
ourselves, our spending patterns as they relate  to  these  priorities,  the
challenges that we are facing and  some  recommendations  to  address  these
challenges.

To quote the Minister of Finance when he addressed this House on a October:


  The fiscal system cuts to the heart  of  co-operative  governance,  which
  requires a  close  alignment  of  policy,  budgeting  and  planning.  Co-
  operative governance will succeed because we are able to co-ordinate  and
  reconcile the priorities of the different spheres and transfer sufficient
  resources to enable provincial and local  governments  to  provide  basic
  services.

We  also  hope  that  as  we  engage  in  discussion  this   afternoon   the
recommendations that will be put forward will be  further  interrogated  and
consulted by the executive and ourselves.

During our discussions, provinces  focused  on  their  priorities,  spending
patterns, and achievements, as well  as  challenges  facing  them.  For  the
purposes of this debate, I want to focus on some of  the  common  challenges
identified by many,  if  not  all,  provinces  that  participated  in  these
hearings.

Dealing with Chapter 5, which focuses on social development,  we  find  that
the transformation process of  the  Department  of  Social  Development  has
moved considerably since our first democratic elections in 1994. People  who
had previously been denied access to the  various  services  now  have  that
access. The shift away from  a  welfare  to  a  developmental  approach  has
brought dignity and self-pride to beneficiaries of these services.

One of the challenges identified is that of  the  child  support  grant.  We
understand the principle behind  the  introduction  of  the  grant  and  its
detail. One of its limitations is that it is  only  accessible  to  a  child
under the age of seven years. With the growing number of unemployed, single-
headed and sometimes orphaned households, this becomes  a  serious  problem.
The steady increase in the uptake since 1999, as tabulated  in  table  5  of
the IGFR, bears testimony to this. A  general  recommendation  was  made  to
increase the age limit to 18, taking into account the  needs  of  a  school-
going child such as food, clothing, school fees and other requirements,  but
we are also mindful of the fact that  this  requires  substantial  financial
resources.

I am just going  to  touch  briefly  on  other  recommendations  because  my
colleagues from the other provinces will also substantiate  this.  Regarding
the issue of orphaned children, with an increasing number of children  being
orphaned, especially by HIV and Aids, we are continually been confronted  by
child-headed households. Our social security system, at  this  moment,  does
not make provision for those households to access social security grants.

The review also addresses the increase in foster care  applications  because
of this pandemic. Provinces are concerned  that  the  increasing  number  of
orphaned  children  will  add  further  strain  of  their  already  strained
budgets. Linked to the previous challenge I have  just  highlighted  is  the
greater demand on the social security budget. Table 5.8 confirms  a  general
steady increase in social security beneficiaries. It is  an  average  of  8%
over a period of four years, to be precise.

The Minister's appointment of a committee  to  investigate  a  comprehensive
social security system is, therefore, welcomed. One  of  the  key  terms  of
reference of this committee is to explore and define options  for  extending
the  social  security  net  amid  affordability  constraints.  Amongst   the
alternatives that could be  explored,  is  the  basic  income  grant,  which
should be subjected to serious interrogation, discussion and consultation.

With regard to the distribution of lottery funds, the  Department  of  Trade
and Industry must, as a matter of urgency, consult with  the  Department  of
Social Development on  the  criteria  of  who  qualifies  for  these  funds.
Government has identified the vulnerable groupings as women,  children,  the
disabled and the elderly. Distribution of these funds  is  to  follow  these
prioritised categories.

Regarding infrastructural development, rural provinces have identified  that
social development offices and service points are not easily accessible.  To
access the services, people often  have  to  travel  long  distances,  which
places an added financial burden on beneficiaries. Furthermore, the lack  of
electricity and other basic services makes it impossible for  these  service
points to operate. The Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  also  acknowledges
the uneven spread of facilities amongst provinces.

I do not think I need to say more on the impact  of  HIV  and  Aids  on  the
spending budget for social development. It  is  acknowledged  that  HIV  and
Aids will impact dramatically on poverty and  household  vulnerability,  and
especially on the need to care for orphans who have lost their  parents  due
to Aids. This is something I have touched on earlier. Current estimates  are
that we will have over two million Aids  orphans  by  the  year  2010.  This
quantifies the magnitude of the challenge that we are facing.

In conclusion, I just want to address some  crosscutting  challenges,  which
are challenges for this department,  the  Department  of  Health  and  other
departments as well. The first challenge is  personnel  expenditure.  Tables
4.18 and 5.14 show a steady increase in personnel expenditure over the  past
three  years.  We  need  to  assess  whether  this   increased   expenditure
contributed to improved service delivery and a better quality of care.

Regarding  interdepartmental  communication,  which  I  think   is   another
crosscutting challenge, I wish to say that what is seriously  lacking  is  a
single information system of government. Each department at the  moment  has
its own information system and database,  which  is  inaccessible  to  other
departments. Because the various departments' information  systems  are  not
linked to each other, Government stands to lose millions, if  not  billions,
of rands annually, due to people fraudulently accessing  multiple  services,
and this goes unnoticed. I therefore recommend that Government  should  move
speedily towards the setting up of one information system and database.

Finally,  we  all  welcomed  this  opportunity   to   interact   with   this
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review and  found  it  very  enlightening.  In  the
course of our discussions we were clearly  able  to  identify  some  of  the
concerns and bring them to a wider forum for a more intense debate.  All  of
us found value in this process and we hope that the recommendations will  be
taken into  account  when  future  budgets  are  formulated  and  finalised.
[Applause.]

Mr C R REDCLIFFE (Western Cape): Madam Chair, I am going to deal  with  both
health and social services in this speech. Allow me to deal with the  social
services component of the debate first.

Unfortunately, the Minister of social services and  poverty  relief  in  the
Western Cape, Mr David Malatsi, is not able to be  present  here  due  to  a
long-standing official engagement out of town. On behalf of the  Minister  I
thank you for the opportunity to give the Western  Cape's  response  to  the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review Report of 2001.

The department of social services in the Western Cape  has  had  to  perform
its function despite a strong real decline  of  its  budget  over  the  past
three years. The maintenance grant was discontinued  without  a  replacement
amount added to this budget for  developmental  programmes.  The  department
used its poverty funding and the national poverty fund to  design  a  safety
net for these mothers so that they will be skilled for targeted employment.

The Western Cape has tried to reach the 80:20 principle, that is 80%  social
security and 20% welfare services, despite the decrease  in  its  budget  in
real terms. It is currently at 82%, as evidenced on page 65 of the review.

The following spending pressures in social security  could  result  in  this
objective not being achieved:  firstly,  the  rapid  take-up  of  the  child
support grant if compared to  the  original  national  target  set  for  the
purpose. The child support grants had  to  be  completed  over  a  five-year
period in line with national targets set for  the  provinces.  In  terms  of
this, the Western Cape had to reach about 76 000 children by 31  March  2002
and 90 000 children by 31 March 2003. As evidenced in table 5.9 on  page  66
of the review, in July 2001 there were already 68 837 beneficiaries.

Our current status is that we already had  90 000  children  in  payment  by
October 2001, and, based on current trends, this will  increase  to  109 000
by 31 March 2002 and 163 000 by 31  March  2003.  We  will  need  additional
funds for this purpose for the MTEF period, an amount  over  and  above  the
original amount that had to be budgeted based on national  projections:  for
2001-02; R23 million; for 2002-03, R102 million; for 2003-04, R182  million;
and for 2004-05; R229 million.

Secondly, the implementation of the disability grant  assessment  panels  in
the place of pension  for  medical  officers  will  require  an  approximate
amount of R10 million per annum. For the current financial  year  an  amount
of R4 million will be required to implement the system. The  required  funds
are as follows: for 2001-02 R4 million; for 2002-03, R10 million; for  2003-
04, R10,6 million; and for 2004-05; R11,3 million.

The third major additional and unplanned expenditure amount which will  have
a carry-through effect during the next MTEF years is  the  payment  of  back
pay as a result of the settlement  of  a  case  lodged  by  the  Black  Sash
against the Department of  Social  Development.  The  settlement  also  adds
interest on the backdated amount to be paid.

Based on preliminary information received from the national department,  the
provincial funding required to implement this  settlement  grant  will  cost
between R300 million and R400 million. Consultation must  still  take  place
with the province to determine how the costs will be spread  over  the  MTEF
period.

We concur with the sentiments in the fiscal review  report  with  regard  to
the improvement of the management structures and the financial  arrangements
in the head office of the department. This  has  been  strengthened  by  the
permanent appointment of a CFO, as illustrated on page 71 of the review.  In
the Western Cape we would like to extend this improved financial  management
to all our district offices. In order to achieve this, we would  require  an
additional allocation. A work study investigation  has  been  completed  and
recommendations made with regard to the improvement of staff  establishment,
which can only lead to improved customer services. We would like  to  embark
on a process of computerisation of our registry to deal with  the  lost-file
syndrome. The total cost of these two strategies is in  the  region  of  R20
million.

Whilst there has been a lot of improvement in  the  social  security  system
with the promulgation of the new regulations which will be  effective  on  1
December 2001, the developmental social services, with particular  reference
to children involved in sexual exploitation and children involved  with  the
law, still  remain  a  worrying  factor.  The  policy  framework,  financial
resources and personnel available are insufficient to render  a  service  to
children in line with all the international  declarations  we  have  signed.
More  social  workers  need  to  employed  by  Government  to  address   the
protection, development and survival of our children.

We further call on this House to support  our  recommendation  and  increase
the age cohorts of the child support grant from 7  to  18  years.  We  would
also recommend  that  the  foster  grants  used  for  children  infected  by
HIV/Aids be supplemented by an additional amount to  cater  for  specialised
care, nutrition and medical expenses.

The Western Cape health department  has  faced  budgetary  pressure  in  the
interests of interprovincial equity since 1995. We have  lost  9  000  staff
and closed 3 000  hospital  beds  in  this  province.  The  brunt  of  these
measures has fallen on the tertiary hospitals. The  financial  savings  have
gone unnoticed by the large salary increases over several years.  The  price
that we have had to pay has comprised quality of care, as  is  evident  from
increasing patient complaints and long waiting  times,  and  from  the  huge
distortions in the skill mix of our staff, with  a  shortage  of  nurses  of
between 1 000 and 1 500 compared to acceptable norms  and  obvious  stresses
and strains on our dedicated  staff  at  all  levels  of  our  service.  The
situation is not helped by the luring of skilled staff, especially  doctors,
nurses and pharmacists, by the private sector and developed  countries,  and
the difficulty in recruiting these categories to our services.

The province confronts an increasing burden of HIV/Aids trauma  and  chronic
diseases with an explosion of new TB cases. Patient activity trends  show  a
significant  increase  at  primary  health  care   services   and   regional
hospitals, and decreases at the tertiary hospitals.  The  senior  management
of the department has been reviewed, restructured and  strengthened  by  the
filling of additional posts. A chief financial officer was appointed  and  a
departmental accountant function strengthened. A business manager  has  been
appointed to develop plans to attract private patients to our facilities  to
establish a forum where the private  sector  can  liaise  with  the  medical
schemes in order to develop favourable  arrangements,  to  develop  improved
billing systems and to improve debt management.

We have made good progress  with  decentralised  management.  A  significant
number of  financial  personnel  and  procurement  delegations  to  regional
directors  and  hospital  managers  have  been  instituted.  The  provincial
Cabinet has supported the principle of a municipality-based district  health
system and the transfer of public health  care  services  at  35  facilities
with approximately 624  staff  to  the  unicity  as  a  first  phase.  These
services would be governed by mutually acceptable service level  agreements.


A revenue incentive  framework  has  been  created  and  the  department  is
currently allowed to retain 50% of the amount allocated  above  its  revenue
budget. This has  incentivised  our  institutional  managers,  and  we  have
reversed a trend of many years of decline in revenue from private  patients.
In 2000-01 we collected R60 million  above  our  target.  We  are  currently
negotiating with the provincial treasury the possibility of  retaining  100%
of the revenue above target.

The spiralling costs of health care in the  private  sector,  amendments  to
the Medical Schemes Act and the possible introduction  of  social  insurance
all provide an opportunity to the public  sector  to  increase  its  revenue
generation  efforts.  We  agree  that  the  department   has   significantly
downsized over the last  seven  years  and  cannot  be  expected  to  do  so
further, without seriously damaging services provided to the  population  of
the Western Cape and beyond.

The provincial health department requires an additional  R100,6  million  in
2000-03 to sustain the current health service level  in  the  province.  The
department is attempting, against great odds,  to  save  R41,03  million  in
2000-02 to partially address the above-mentioned requirement. This  presumes
no additional spending pressures will be  accommodated  during  the  2000-02
financial year and no expansion of services or filling of  additional  posts
in the 2000-2003 financial year.

The inequities in funding and access  to  tertiary  or  quaternary  services
between the provinces need to be addressed urgently. However, major cuts  in
the conditional grants in the Western Cape and Gauteng  are  being  proposed
without a national vision and a plan addressing many  questions,  including:
What tertiary and quaternary services can the country afford?  Where  should
these be provided? How do we ensure equitable access  to  them?  How  do  we
maintain economies of scale  and  technical  quality  at  these  centres  of
excellence? [Time expired.]

Mr M V NGEMA (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, I thank you for this  opportunity
to address this august House in the debate on the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal
Review. I will focus on the area of social security, which houses a  lot  of
problems for the province. We think that  we  need  to  focus  much  of  our
attention on this area. The social security programme  budget  accounts  for
about 94% in our province. This means that only 6% of  the  budget  is  left
for the other programmes,  which  include  key  programmes  such  as  social
services rendered by the department; the social assistance programme,  which
deals  with  the  funding  of  private  welfare  organisations;  and  social
development, which seeks to create self-reliance among the citizens  of  the
province.

As a province we see the value of ensuring that within the 6%  the  capacity
of our people to reduce reliance on social grants  needs  to  be  built  and
sustained. Programmes such as social development need to  be  targeted,  and
in this case the flagship  programme  in  particular  holds  much  hope  for
making the required impact on the lives of the people of poor communities.

The increase in the number of children in receipt of  child  support  grants
has been sustained throughout the expenditure year,  as  is  illustrated  by
the following figures: In April we made 264 448 payments; in May,  295  235;
and in August, 352 630. In September the figure was 386  116  and  since  13
October, we have made 390 856 payments.

While the above growth is very  encouraging,  concern  about  its  financial
implications  is  being  expressed.  The  nationally  set  target  for  this
province is to have 60 000 children in payment by March 2003. Based  on  the
trends in the growth of child support grants, this target is  likely  to  be
reached by August 2002, some six months ahead of target.

Of major concern is the  effect  that  this  sustained  growth  has  on  the
budget. It was estimated that there would be  a  shortfall  on  the  current
budget of approximately R295 million for grant  payments.  This  matter  has
now been brought to the  attention  of  both  the  provincial  and  national
treasuries.

We support the proposed review of the age limit, starting from the age of  7
to 18 years. However, we are mindful of the fact that this  will  also  have
immense financial implications.  The  department  notes  with  concern  that
poverty, mostly in the rural hinterlands, causes an alarming growth  in  the
young population as a result  of  the  available  funds  from  this  scheme.
Coupled with this is the increase of orphans, brought about by the  HIV/Aids
pandemic facing our societies.

The growth in the number of foster care  grants  paid  is  steady,  but  not
nearly as significant as the CSG. This causes concern as we know that  there
is a significant number of  children  in  alternate  care  who  should  have
access to this form of support.

One of the areas of concern, apart from the  lengthy  process  required  for
children to be placed in foster care, is the fact  that  some  commissioners
of child welfare at children's courts will not consider  kinship  placement.
The impact of this is that these children do not  even  get  to  the  social
security section to apply for the grant as the placement  is  not  confirmed
by the court.

In the absence of a court order, no grant can be paid. This is  contrary  to
the spirit of the Child Care Act of 1983. We are happy to note that this  is
being addressed in the comprehensive child care legislation currently  being
drafted.

The following figures illustrate the position regarding foster  care  grants
in the current financial year. In April this year, 8 900  grants  were  paid
out; in May, 9 112; in June, 9 285; in July, 9 521;  in  August,  9 785;  in
September, 10 485; and in  October,  10 845.  It  must  be  noted  that  the
figures mentioned reflect the number of grants, not  the  number  of  foster
children in payment. Each grant can reflect a payment  to  as  many  as  six
children.

Statistics on the number of foster children in  payment  are  not  available
from Socpen, although we have requested this. A comparative  number  can  be
given for January this year, when a total of 8 191 foster care  grants  were
paid in respect of 15 880 children.

I thank the House on behalf of the province of KwaZulu-Natal. [Applause.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Madam Chair, hon Ministers  and  hon  members  of  the  House,
thank you for the opportunity to interact in this fiscal review.

South Africa's revenue is based on a national fiscal system, with  provinces
largely dependent on transfers from the national Government. What we see  is
that national  Government's  role  is  mainly  that  of  policy-making  with
provincial and local  governments  responsible  for  the  implementation  of
major  social  services,  including  academic  and  regional  hospitals  and
primary health care, social grants and welfare services.

Since these functions have limited or no cost-recovery potential,  provinces
are largely dependent on  transfers  from  nationally  raised  revenue.  The
private and public health sectors comprise about 8% of  South  Africa's  GDP
and the public health sector more than 13% of total government expenditure.

The public  health  sector  is  of  great  importance  because  84%  of  the
population is not covered by medical aid  schemes.  The  limited  access  to
private health care is illustrated by  the  fact  that  only  10,2%  of  the
population in the Eastern Cape has medical  schemes.  This  is  the  second-
lowest figure of all the provinces.

Primary health care is  the  most  significant  component  of  the  district
hospital programme. In the Eastern Cape, with its sparsely  populated  rural
areas, we have, quite rightly, the most  clinics:  676  facilities  and  120
mobiles. The problem is that these clinics  are  understaffed  and  doctors'
availability to clinics is very low.

The following are significant  inequities  in  the  Eastern  Cape  and  need
attention: the frequent unavailability of a number of important  tests;  the
unavailability of emergency transport; the absence of basic  equipment;  the
interruption of telephone services and electricity; the absence  of  running
water at many clinics; and the occasional unavailability of some key drugs.

Although the emphasis in the  health  sector  has  shifted  towards  primary
health care, expenditure on hospitals still comprises at least 46% of  total
provincial health expenditure. In the Eastern  Cape  there  is  evidence  of
inefficiencies with low bed occupancy, stays in hospitals  that  are  longer
than desirable and inefficiencies of staff.

What needs to be addressed is the  fact  that  the  proportion  of  patients
admitted with HIV/Aids has grown substantially. This means  that  even  real
growth in health budgets will not be adequate to deal with the  increase  in
demand for services and the impact  of  the  disease  on  resources  in  the
health sector.

The social development departments in provinces are responsible  for  social
security programmes. In  the  Eastern  Cape  -  and,  I  presume,  in  other
provinces too - the social development department is always at  the  end  of
the line in the rendering of services. The inability of  other  departments,
for example Home Affairs, to deliver has an influence on  the  effectiveness
of the service. More than 216 000 children get grants in my province  and  a
lot more need grants, but access to certificates is problematic.

The Government should reconsider the age limit for  the  child  grant.  Many
older children also need  grants.  These  children  have  to  attend  school
whilst hungry.

HIV/Aids has a huge impact on social development. We cannot allow people  to
suffer because we do not plan and manage the budgets properly.

The departments of social development and health have jointly embarked  upon
the  implementation  of  home-based  care  programmes  in   their   budgets,
especially in the area of HIV/Aids. We must remember the  increasing  number
of  child-headed  households  which,  in  normal  circumstances,  could   be
excluded from accessing Government grants. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, hon members  of  the  NCOP,
ladies and gentlemen, since 1994 the Government has  prioritised  redressing
socioeconomic  inequalities  and  reducing  poverty  in  this  country.  The
trends, analysis of  service  delivery  and  concerns  raised  in  the  2001
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review reflect the continuing  priority  Government
gives to this issue.

This commitment to reducing poverty and inequality is reflected in both  the
big picture of provincial spending patterns and the  snapshots  of  spending
trends in the four key areas of social development. While  the  consolidated
provincial expenditures show increases over the past three years, there  are
still major gaps in per capita expenditure between provinces.  For  example,
Gauteng spends just more than double per poor person than the people  living
in the Northern province.

The snapshots of spending trends within social development budgets focus  on
four key areas identified by the Council of  Social  Development  Ministers,
that is the Minmec. Minmec  has  identified  four  focus  areas  for  social
development  budgets  in  the  2002-03  period.  These  focus   areas   are:
strengthening the  safety  net;  improving  service  delivery;  transforming
welfare services and responding to the impact of HIV/Aids  in  our  society.
The budgeting expenditure patterns and service delivery in these four  areas
were also extensively discussed  in  the  joint  social  development-finance
Minmec in August this year.

It is vital that the members of the NCOP debate the  trends  and  issues  in
all four of these focal areas. Although we  may  talk  of  focal  areas  and
snapshots, we are talking about real human beings and  the  work  Government
is doing to build a caring society.

The rights, aspirations, dreams  and  experiences  of  the  most  vulnerable
members of our society must be in our hearts and minds as  we  debate  these
trends and issues. I will speak to all four of these focal  areas  in  turn.
With respect to the strengthening of safety nets,  the  point  of  departure
for our discussion has to be the importance  of  social  grants  in  poverty
alleviation. Social grants are the major and often  sole  source  of  income
for many poor households in South Africa.  The  direct  transfer  of  social
grants to beneficiaries forms a significant  part  of  Government's  poverty
alleviation strategy.

Not only is the system of social grants more equitable  than  was  the  case
prior to 1994, the number of beneficiaries has increased over the  past  few
years. As of July 2001, there were nearly 4 million people  benefiting  from
social grants. This increase can be  attributed  to  the  expansion  in  the
number  of  care-givers  receiving  the  child  support  grant,  which   was
introduced in 1998.

In 1999 there were approximately 60 000 children benefiting from  the  child
support grant. There are now over 1,2 million  beneficiaries  of  the  child
support grant. This is thanks to the stellar work of MECs,  parliamentarians
and civil society organisations, especially the  NGOs  and  the  faith-based
organisations, in mobilising care-givers to access the grant.

We face a number of challenges in the area of  social  grants.  The  current
system of social grants does not reach all poor  children  and  adults.  The
child support grant does not cover children  of  school-going  age  and,  in
addition,  people  experience  problems  in  obtaining  the  required  birth
certificates and ID books.

At the other end of the scale, adults are not covered until they  reach  the
age of 60 years for women and 65 years for men. These are among  the  issues
being investigated by the Committee of Inquiry into  Social  Security  which
was  established  by  Government  last  year.  We  expect  to  receive   the
committee's report within the next two weeks.

Another challenge is to effect affordable increases in the value of  grants.
Last year the grant increases were at the level of inflation. This has  been
a positive move. We are discussing possible increases with our  counterparts
in Finance and we will be meeting again next month to consider the  options.
At the same time, we are improving access to both the disability  grant  and
the foster care grant.

The assessment procedures for disability grants have  posed  a  problem  for
people who do not have access to  district  surgeons,  especially  in  rural
areas. We have amended the Social Assistance Act regulations  to  allow  for
assessment by a  panel  for  those  who  do  not  have  access  to  district
surgeons.

There is an increased demand for the foster care grants  owing  to  extended
families and others having to take care of orphaned children  through  Aids-
related illnesses. Court procedures are lengthy  and  applicants  experience
difficulties with magistrates.

The SA Law Commission has been requested to  finalise  the  new  child  care
legislation. We have been expecting that them to report to us by the end  of
this year but, unfortunately, from our experience and more importantly  from
the report that we received from the portfolio committee,  it  seems  to  me
and it seems to the portfolio committee  that  the  Law  Commission  is  not
ready at all. It seems to us that it only woke up  to  its  duties  when  we
started talking about this issue in public.

An  increasing  number  of  households  are  experiencing  distress  through
unemployment or the loss of breadwinners. Provinces are  under  pressure  to
provide  social  relief  to  these  households  with  modest  social  relief
budgets. The need  to  improve  service  delivery  in  the  area  of  social
security has  been  highlighted  by  the  Ministerial  Committee  on  Abuse,
Neglect and Ill-Treatment  of  Older  Persons.  Services  delivered  through
contractors have, on the whole, been unsatisfactory up to today.

We have developed norms and standards for service delivery, which have  been
approved in principle by  Cabinet.  The  implementation  details  are  under
discussion, and some of the technical work such as  the  standardisation  of
processes between provinces will commence this year. We are also working  on
improving  the  conditions  at  pension   paypoints.   An   audit   of   the
infrastructure at paypoints, which will assist in planning and  rolling  out
these improvements, is close to completion.

Traditionally, capital expenditure in  the  social  development  sector  has
been limited. It will be necessary in the future to incur such  expenditure.
We anticipate and plan to share infrastructure with other departments,  such
as Home Affairs, where appropriate.

As indicated in the Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review,  financial  management
in the provinces has been  steadily  improving.  Provincial  departments  of
social development have been  given  conditional  grants  to  improve  their
financial management. This is beginning to yield positive results. Our  work
with the provinces, however, has highlighted serious  capacity  constraints.
Provinces do not have  the  requisite  number  of  officials  to  carry  out
required functions. In other words, the number of  public  servants  working
in this sector is not enough.
The third focal area in social development budgets for the year  2000-01  is
welfare services. This is an area in which the pace of transformation  needs
to be rapidly increased. On average welfare services account for 10% of  the
budget of provincial departments, with social grants accounting for 90%.

With increased pressures on the  social  grants  component  of  the  budget,
there has been limited growth in the budgets for welfare services  over  the
past few years. Because of poverty and the continued vulnerability of  older
people, women,  children  and  disabled  persons,  provinces  and  NGOs  are
experiencing an increase in demand for welfare services and  cannot  respond
effectively because of budget constraints. This is compounded  by  the  fact
that access to services in rural areas and in the poorer provinces is  very,
very limited.

In the face of this challenging reality, the Council of  Social  Development
Ministers,  Minmec,  has  agreed   upon   a   comprehensive   programme   of
transformation that includes  the  review  and  revision  of  policies,  the
assessment of the adequacy of existing  legislation,  audits  of  subsidised
organisations and  the  development  of  norms  and  standards  for  welfare
services.

A  national  task  team  on  financing  policy  consisting  of  four  social
development MECs has concluded that the financing for  developmental  social
service and welfare must be reviewed as there are indications that  it  will
not fundamentally change the 1994 status quo. Based upon a rapid  appraisal,
the MECs have concluded that the financing  policy  provides  principles  to
guide resource allocation in a developmental direction. It does not  provide
mechanisms that can translate these principles into action.

The adequacy of existing welfare legislation is also  being  examined.  Much
of the  current  legislation  was  developed  prior  to  1994  and  numerous
amendments have resulted in fragmented legislation.  We  are  also  auditing
subsidised organisations to determine  the  extent  to  which  services  are
being transformed. The audit of homes for the elderly has been  prioritised.


In addition to these, norms and standards for delivery of  welfare  services
will be  developed  along  similar  lines  to  those  developed  for  social
security. It is expected that  a  substantial  part  of  the  work  will  be
completed by the end of the financial year.

I would like to conclude  by  addressing  our  focus  area,  the  impact  of
HIV/Aids on our society. The Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  states  that
the impact of HIV is visible  and  highlights  the  impact  of  HIV/Aids  on
social security. As part of an ongoing and concerted response,  the  Council
of Social  Development  Ministers  has  focused  on  four  issues:  firstly,
options available to infected and affected people; secondly, access  to  the
foster care grant; thirdly, home and community-based care alternatives;  and
lastly, the use  of  the  poverty  relief  programme  to  support  community
initiatives.

The committee  of  inquiry  into  comprehensive  social  security  has  been
investigating and  costing  the  various  options  for  providing  effective
coverage for people infected and affected by HIV/Aids. I  have  also  spoken
about the issue of foster care grants. It is essential that  we  remove  the
insensitive obstacle to accessing the foster care grant.

An essential component of our response is a provision of  support  for  home
and  community-based  care  alternatives.  The  joint  health   and   social
development Minmec has agreed to implement a programme of support for  home-
based and  community-based  care  and  conditional  grants  have  been  made
available for this purpose.

In addition, the poverty relief fund has been used  to  support  initiatives
in  this  area  by  community-based  and  faith-based   organisations.   The
departments of health and social development,  at  national  and  provincial
levels, are working to expand this programme rapidly.

In conclusion, I would like to underscore  the  fact  that  the  Council  of
Social  Development  Ministers,  that  is,  the  Minmec,   appreciates   the
projected increases in the social development budget  in  the  MTEF  period.
But this budget still needs to take the following  into  account:  increases
above inflation; the desired extension of the child  support  grant  to  all
children  up  to  the  age  of  18;  the  provision  and  upgrading  of  the
infrastructure;  development  and  increase  of  human  resource   capacity,
specifically, in the former Bantustans and in the  provinces;  the  need  to
pay better subsidies to welfare organisations; and the need to  improve  the
provision of social relief to people in distress in general  throughout  the
country.

We remain committed to the delivery of our priorities and I  call  upon  the
hon members of the NCOP to join us in this effort. I think that  it  is  the
duty of all of us. We know very clearly that what brought the ANC  to  power
was mostly our commitment to serve the poorest of the  poor.  I  can  openly
and very clearly say that there is no government in the world,  specifically
in the developing world, which has come out  very  openly  on  the  problems
that face our people, particularly the people that voted  the  ANC  and  the
IFP into power, regarding the issue of poverty.

We are the only country in the world that comes  out  and  says  openly  and
very clearly in each and  every  forum  that  our  main  battle  is  against
poverty in South Africa, and that we will do  everything  in  our  power  to
overcome it. As such, from the NCOP we expect and demand, as the  ANC,  that
members should join the executive in  ensuring  that  the  views,  concerns,
aspirations and hopes of the poorest of the poor do get a reflection in  the
work that we do. Hon members should raise the people's point of view and  go
back to their provinces and to their people, not only  in  the  capitals  of
Bisho, Durban or Pietersburg, but also in the  far-flung  villages  in  this
country where there is no water and  electricity,  and  where  most  of  the
people have nothing to eat. And we should all know that we are  servants  of
those people, and that, as the IFP and the ANC, it is our only duty in  this
country and in this Government. [Applause.]
Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson,  hon  Minister  of  Health,  Deputy  Minister  of
Finance, MECs here and special delegates, although we have  all  noted  that
considerable strides have been made in the provision of health care  to  our
people, especially primary health care, we still need to  pay  attention  to
particular  challenges  facing  us.  I  will  go   into   these   challenges
immediately. We will follow the same procedure as in our previous debate  in
order to highlight and propose some recommendations  around  some  of  those
challenges.

Most of the provinces  have  reported  staff  shortages  in  human  resource
development  and  management.  In  many  provinces,  this  was   the   case,
especially if one looks at the doctor/nurse-patient ratio.  The  appointment
of CEOs at the hospitals who will have the  power  to  hire  staff  to  fill
vacant funded posts will go a long way to alleviate this problem.

It is noted in the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review that there has been  very
slow progress in the accessing of the R243 million  allocated  as  a  health
management grant over a period of three years  to  assist  CEOs  to  improve
hospital management. We should also invest in the  upgrading  of  skills  of
especially our nursing personnel  and  identify  areas  of  speciality,  for
example, psychiatry and other areas where there is a need.

Closely linked to the issue of human resources is service delivery  and  the
quality of care. Shortages of staff and a lack of equipment  and  medication
are often  reported  at  facilities  throughout  the  country.  This  surely
impacts on service delivery and the quality of  care  that  our  people  are
subjected to.

Regarding the inequity in health care spending, I want to  refer  colleagues
to tables 4.7 and 4.8 of the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review.  As  indicated
in table 4.7, large per capita  spending  differentials  still  remain.  Per
capita spending in Gauteng is nearly twice that of Mpumalanga and 1,6  times
that of the Northern Province. Inequities in expenditure  are  reflected  in
the  quality  of  service  delivery  at  all  levels.  Mpumalanga  has   0,9
specialists  per  100  000  of  the  population  whereas  Gauteng  has  30,9
specialists per 100 000 population. I refer hon members to table 4,8.  These
inequalities suggest large differentials in access and point  to  variations
in quality of service.

Regarding the recruitment and retention of health  care  personnel,  we  are
bombarded on a daily basis in our newspapers by reports suggesting  a  brain
drain, etc, particularly of health care personnel to the UK,  Saudi  Arabia,
Canada, etc. Noting that it is also said that our health care personnel  are
amongst the best trained worldwide, it is almost to be  expected  that  they
would be poached by other countries.

We should put our heads together, though, to strategise  on  how  to  retain
trained personnel. One  possible  way  is  to,  at  the  level  of  tertiary
institutions  through  the  curriculum,  instil  the  value  and  spirit  of
patriotism and service to the community. Another possible way is  to  relook
at the conditions of service and incentives especially for those working  in
rural areas.

With regard to the fiscal impact of HIV/Aids, we  need  to  do  an  in-depth
evaluation of the cost  of  HIV/Aids  on  our  health  budget.  Already  the
National Treasury is collaborating with the Department of Health to  develop
a more effective financing strategy for a public  health  response  to  this
epidemic.

We are looking forward to more details on this financing  strategy  and  the
mechanisms that would assist provinces  to  implement  programmes,  such  as
home-based care, mother-to-child transmission  prevention,  life-skills  and
other innovative programmes.

We need to find ways and means of addressing the financial  impact  HIV/Aids
will have on our health care facilities, the staff, the  health  budget  and
the economy of the country at large, since those dying  are  largely  within
the economically active age group of roughly 20 to 45 years of age.

With regard to hospital construction  and  rehabilitation,  the  process  of
hospital and clinic rehabilitation and reconstruction has to be speeded  up.
A constant inventory of facilities in need has to be  compiled  and  updated
on a regular basis and, of course, resources have to be  made  available  to
upgrade those facilities.

Regarding  private-public  partnerships,  private  sector  health  care   is
provided  by  individuals,  general  practitioners,   specialists,   private
clinics and hospitals. This service  is  usually  provided  to  people  with
medical aid coverage or to people who can afford such cash payments.  It  is
estimated that about 84% of the population is not covered  by  medical  aid.
The gap between private and public health care needs to be narrowed  through
a partnership  between  the  two,  through  a  basic  package  of  emergency
services that can be provided to any patient  at  any  private  institution.
This, we  believe,  will  broaden  access  to  appropriate  and  much-needed
services.

Last, but not least, on the monitoring of our achievements, to  many  of  us
this might not seem as important, but it is only through monitoring what  we
have achieved that we will come to know how far  we  still  have  to  go  in
service delivery to the poor and most vulnerable.

We need to set up a  mechanism  in  terms  of  which  we  will  monitor  and
evaluate  the  implementation  of  our  policies  and  learn  through  basic
practices from our colleagues in other provinces. We  believe  we  all  have
something to learn from each  other's  experiences  and  best  practices  to
improve the quality of life of our people. [Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, heel aan die begin  wil  ek  die  Departement  van
Finansies bedank vir  die  wyse  waarop  hulle  vanjaar  hierdie  belangrike
onderwerp aangebied het. Dit gee vir ons, as  lede  van  die  NRP,  'n  baie
beter  insig  oor  hoe  die  belastingbetaler  se  geld  in  die  provinsies
aangewend  word,  en  wat  die  standaard  van  dienslewering  is  in   elke
provinsie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, at the outset I want to thank the Department  of
Finance for the way they presented this important subject  this  year.  This
gives us, as members of the NCOP, far better insight into the way  in  which
the taxpayer's money is being  utilised  in  the  provinces,  and  what  the
standard of service delivery in every province is.]

According to the report under the heading  ``Provincial  Health  Spending'',
the total actual provincial health spending for 2000-01 was  R26,4  billion.
This reflects an increase of R2,3 billion or 10% compared  to  the  previous
year. But this was still more than R0,8  billion  or  3%  lower  than  their
adjusted budgets. Some provinces even spend less than their voted budgets.

As far as conditional grants are concerned,  according  to  the  report  the
provincial  health  sectors  received  the  largest  share,  with  transfers
totalling R6 billion in the year 2000-01. It is, however, with concern  that
one notices that during the past  two  financial  years  these  grants  were
grossly underspent. On the integrated nutrition programme alone  the  amount
underspent over the past two years was R305 million.
In spite of the fact that it is estimated, according  to  the  report,  that
approximately 40%  of  hospital  facilities  require  replacement  or  major
repair at the cost of approximately R12 billion  over  the  next  10  years,
there  was  underspending  over   the   past   three   years   on   hospital
rehabilitation grants.

The provinces, however, cannot be blamed solely for  the  underspending,  as
the nontransferral of budgeted funds is to be blamed for  this  to  a  large
extent. One can only hope that this situation will improve as the  effective
utilisation of grants should be a high priority.

The  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  produced  a  detailed  breakdown  of
exactly how and where HIV/Aids  is  affecting  provincial  governments.  The
report of the Medical Research Council's recent study is quite clear on  the
fact that HIV/Aids is already the single  biggest  killer  in  the  country.
Owing to this, according to the IFR, patients with  Aids  are  progressively
replacing or crowding out other patients. According to the hon  MEC  in  the
Free State, this is already the situation in the Free State. If  the  status
quo is maintained and all Aids patients are treated in hospitals within  the
next three years, all hospital beds will be occupied  by  HIV/Aids  patients
and there will be no place to care for patients with other ailments.

It is also quite clear from the IRF that most of the provinces  have  failed
to plan for  this  progressive  replacement  of  other  patients  in  public
hospitals. One can only hope that this report will be  a  wake-up  call  for
all the provinces to start taking specific measures to reduce the impact  of
Aids and for the Government to provide them  with  adequate  funds,  and  to
inspire the provinces to spend them. [Applause.]

Mr H T SOGONI: Chairperson, Ministers, MECs present,  hon  members,  in  the
annual reports of the departments of health 2000-01, inequality, the  impact
on  HIV/Aids  and  the  provision  of  quality  health  care  services  were
identified as challenges facing these  departments.  The  serious  task  and
commitment of this department to meet the challenges is reflected  therefore
in the rate of spending  on  social  services,  which  dominates  provincial
spending, accounting for over 80% of the total spending in the provinces.

During the session on the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review,  provincial  MECs
and chairpersons of standing committees in the provincial  departments  also
fell in line with the national department, as their priorities also  related
directly to equity, access to care, quality care  and  primary  health  care
services, HIV/Aids programmes and infrastructure  development  in  order  to
address the past imbalances.

While it is appreciated that steps  are  reported  to  have  been  taken  to
reduce overspending in the past or to  improve  the  capacity  to  spend  by
means of improvement in  budget  processes  and  proper  finance  management
systems, particular note was taken during the review process when  provinces
made proposals that could really make the difference  and  strengthen  their
strategies to improve service delivery.
The following areas of attention immediately come to  mind.  The  impact  of
HIV/Aids on our communities is quite heavy. I  fully  agree  with  the  view
that  it  is  a  major  fiscal  challenge  and  that,  as   one   provincial
representative clearly stated during the fiscal review, ``We  need  to  move
at an abnormal speed to find solutions to the  scourge.''  There  is  indeed
provision  for  HIV/Aids  programmes  in  all  the  departments  of   social
services, but the observation made  in  the  constituencies  is  that  there
should be a more visible or measurable  indication  of  integrated  and  co-
operative planning, implementation and monitoring by departments of  health,
education and social development together.

Infrastructure development and maintenance of  the  existing  ones  in  many
areas of service delivery is  extremely  necessary.  To  cite  one  example:
There is a reported case of a pregnant mother who gave birth at the back  of
a bakkie on her way to St Mary's Hospital in Ixopo, because the vehicle  got
stuck  in  the  mud  for  hours.  Ambulance  services  in  the  poor   rural
communities  are  indeed  poor  owing  to  the  condition   of   our   roads
infrastructure, which does not suit the services.

Finally, all  the  efforts  by  the  departments  to  fulfil  their  service
delivery obligations become fruitless if corruption and criminal  activities
are not eliminated in the departments. Theft of drugs  in  hospitals,  fraud
involving officers ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M M MAMASE (Eastern  Cape):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  of  Health  and
Deputy Minister of Finance, hon members of the House,  hon  MECs,  over  the
past three years the Eastern Cape department of health has  not  experienced
any real growth in budgetary terms. We have experienced a decline  in  human
resources. As a result, as we continue to rise to the challenges facing  us,
our ability to do so efficiently and effectively is hampered by the lack  of
professional staff,  more  especially  doctors,  dentists,  pharmacists  and
physiotherapists.

The two major challenges are  to  resource  the  department  of  health  and
rehabilitate the infrastructure. This will allow the  department  to  effect
its mandated position without hiccups. It is, however, important for  us  to
realise that,  having  said  that  there  is  a  decline  in  staff  in  the
department of health, we have managed to put  the  following  in  place:  We
have revised and put in place a new establishment reflecting  the  needs  of
the department. We have strengthened the management  capacity  in  the  head
office  to  meet  the  PFMA  and  human  resource  requirements.   We   have
prioritised and targeted 10 institutions  to  turn  them  around  to  effect
service delivery. We are also processing the  amalgamation  of  the  nursing
colleges not only to  reflect  the  current  training  needs,  but  also  to
incorporate the transformation of services.

The department of health has been tasked to  co-ordinate  the  social  needs
cluster in the province, with  five  prioritised  programmes,  ie  HIV/Aids,
district development, victim  empowerment,  poverty  alleviation  and  urban
renewal.  We  have  prioritised  HIV/Aids  and  TB  services  as   the   top
requirement for quality care services.

With  regard  to  current   services,   our   communities   have   benefited
tremendously from better access to essential primary health  care  services.
Most of our clinics provide nine basic services over a five-day period,  and
access to women's and children's health services is  enhanced.  Our  clinics
currently see 14 million people annually. The department has a fleet of  149
emergency vehicles and a crew of 800 men and women.

The department is finalising the provincialisation of the emergency  medical
rescue services. These services are still  provided  at  local  municipality
level. To consolidate these services in the province,  as  well  as  improve
and beef up the fleet and the training crew,  we  have  established  service
partnerships with donors, NGOs and the private sector for  the  mobilisation
of resources and by focusing  on  one  objective  -  effective  delivery  of
services to communities.

We have worked out with Cohsasa, in more than 19  hospitals,  piloted  norms
and standards in 10 district hospitals, and we have  extensively  publicised
and launched the Patients' Rights Charter in all our districts.

The following are currently our most  pressing  challenges:  Human  resource
development  remains  our  major  challenge  in  the  department.  The  most
affected areas are recruitment and retention of  staff,  especially  in  the
previously disadvantaged areas. The need to appoint personnel,  particularly
in critical posts, cannot be overemphasised. This  will  constitute  84%  of
our establishment.

With regard  to  the  equitable  delivery  of  services,  the  Eastern  Cape
province is one of the poor provinces in the country,  but  the  budget  did
not grow in real terms in the last three years to  meet  provincial  demands
for health services. There is still  intraprovincial  inequity.  The  former
Transkei and Ciskei areas  still  have  major  infrastructure  backlogs  and
hostile road terrain.

It is  critical  to  realise  that  without  a  substantial  improvement  in
addressing infrastructure backlogs, information  technology,  capital  works
and equipment, the province will always play a catch-up role. Investment  in
infrastructure will not only improve service delivery, but will also have  a
direct beneficial role in rural development.

The refurbishing of hospitals is of critical importance. For this reason  we
are  now  accelerating  the  hospital  rehabilitation   and   reconstruction
programme and the introduction of information technology, if our request  is
approved by the provincial treasury. [Applause.]

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I am delighted to participate in this debate  on
behalf of my beloved  MEC  for  health  in  the  Free  State  province,  Mrs
Mantsheng Tsopo, who would have been here but is unable to  attend.  We  are
able, as permanent delegates, to  execute  the  duties  on  behalf  of  such
people.

The past three years represent a continuous conquest of  milestones  in  the
department of health in the Free State. We have grappled with  a  number  of
challenges ranging from the  backlog  in  assistive  devices  and  emergency
services  vehicles  to  the  availability   of   medical   consumables   and
pharmaceuticals in our institutions.

In the presentation to  this  House  on  16  October  2001,  our  provincial
department focused on our priorities  and  spending  trends  over  the  past
three years. In this debate, I would like to focus on  the  challenges  that
lie ahead to  address  the  shortcomings  raised  by  the  review.  It  must
certainly be a generally known fact that these challenges are  what  we  are
grappling with as the ANC-led Government during this historical review.

One of the issues that we need to look into is  the  question  of  equity  -
providing equally. The first challenge  is  around  this  issue  of  equity.
According to the review, that was made  on  16  October  2001  in  the  Free
State, the per capita  health  expenditure  is  R792,  which  is  above  the
national average. The health component of the  provincial  budget  is  about
23%, almost the same as  the  national  average.  However,  the  Free  State
receives less than its share of the Central Hospital Conditional Grant,  and
believes that this anomaly will be corrected in the next financial year,  as
the department often accedes to our humble requests.

The inequities  between  districts  and  the  urban-rural  divide  remain  a
challenge. The development of a formula towards  an  equitable  distribution
of resources between provinces remains a priority. The formula  should  take
into consideration the demography, backlogs  and  the  disease  profiles  of
each district.

One other thorny issue is that of transfer payments  to  local  authorities.
The essential primary health care  package  shall  be  implemented  and  the
transfer to  local  government  should  be  in  terms  of  a  service  level
agreement.

It is our most firm belief that quality health  service  delivery  will  not
have been achieved if the rural poor are  still  not  reached  through  this
service. The department is thus reviewing  the  rendering  of  rural  health
services and is planning to improve access to 24-hour services,  which  will
go a long way in providing access to health services for all those  in  dire
need.

The Free State is on course with implementing the  district  health  system,
DHS. We have put the necessary and relevant governance structures  in  place
in line with the DHS.  Members  of  the  provincial  health  authority  were
appointed in terms of section 5 of the Free  State  Health  Act,  Act  8  of
1999. The first meeting of the provincial health authority, or PHA, will  be
held before the end of November 2001.  The  PHA  board  was  constituted  in
terms of section 11 of the Free State Health Act.

District  health  authorities  for  the  five  health  districts   will   be
constituted before the end of this financial year.  District  managers  have
been appointed and the districts  are  aligned  to  the  five  new  district
municipalities. Hospital boards are in place at all 31 public  hospitals  in
the Free State province, which is quite an achievement.

The challenge, therefore, remains in the effectiveness of  these  governance
structures to ensure meaningful community participation. We are  nonetheless
moving with speed in this direction.

The HIV/Aids epidemic is without doubt something that we have to  deal  with
head-on. The following co-ordinating structures  have  been  established  to
help handle the HIV/Aids epidemic in  the  Free  State  province:  the  Free
State Province Aids Council, the Interministerial Committee on HIV/Aids  and
the Interdepartmental Committee on HIV/Aids.  District  Aids  councils  will
all also be launched by the end of July 2002.

The impact of the HIV/Aids pandemic on health services is  probably  one  of
the biggest  challenges  we  are  facing.  The  department  is  implementing
comprehensive  home  and  community-based  care,  as   well   as   step-down
facilities. We are currently looking at the provincial budget  on  HIV/Aids,
which has been tabled and discussed with the provincial treasurer.

The department received an infrastructure grant of R7 million.  This  amount
is being used to address the  backlog  in  maintenance  of  our  facilities,
including the replacement of incinerators to  meet  the  legal  obligations.
The challenges of maintaining our facilities and building  new  ones  remain
the same. In total 49 projects to a  total  value  of  R61 970  million  are
being undertaken in the province. We are thankful  and  very  proud  of  the
capital stock we have, and we invite any member of this House to  visit  our
facilities to see how we can look after ourselves.

The recruitment and retention of health professionals remains  a  challenge.
We are looking forward to  the  roll-out  of  community  services  to  other
health  professionals.  There  are  16  management  posts  in   the   senior
management service, 63% of which are  already  filled  by  indigenous  black
people, 32% of them by women. However, representivity amongst  professionals
still remains a challenge.

The department is also concerned about how low revenue  collection  is  this
year. The hospitals have on average managed only 50% of the levied  revenue.
A revenue task team has been appointed  to  propose  strategies  to  improve
revenue generation.

In conclusion, I would like to thank  the  executive  council  of  the  Free
State Provincial Government for its support and understanding. I  also  want
to thank the management of the Department of  Health  for  their  dedication
and commitment. Lastly, but not least,  I  want  to  thank  all  the  health
workers in the department for unselfishly serving  the  communities  of  the
Free State.

I have no doubt that this road  we  have  travelled  was  filled  with  many
milestones. We have been able to pass several of them. Our success in  doing
so has given us more confidence to deal with the  remaining  challenges.  It
is our resolve that we will forever remain vigilant and never for  a  moment
lose sight of the dynamic nature of health service delivery.  In  this  path
we have travelled with friends and supporters, and we hope  that  they  will
always be there with us until the journey is complete.

God needs us all. Health is everybody's right. We must continue to care,  to
share and to be united. Irrespective of who one is, one is  a  special  gift
of God, God's child, and we need everyone to be very  healthy  in  order  to
make miracles happen in this country, so that God can begin  to  rule  again
in our lives and in this country. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, I did not give the speaker  even
one  extra  minute.  There  are  people  who  seem  to  be  doubting   that.
[Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF  HEALTH:  Chairperson,  Deputy  Minister  of  Finance,  MECs
present here, members of the NCOP, ladies and gentlemen,  I  would  like  to
take this opportunity to thank members of the  NCOP  for  affording  me  the
opportunity to address them.

In starting, I must congratulate the Minister of Finance and his  team  from
Treasury  on  the  hard  work  that  has  resulted  in  a  very   good   and
comprehensive document.

In the  course  of  developing  the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review,  the
Department of  Health  has  been  given  an  opportunity  to  make  comments
specifically on the chapter that deals with health. The fiscal review  comes
soon  after  the  completion  of  another  major  review  of  financing  and
expenditure trends, an exercise that has produced a set of figures  that  we
refer to in the department as the national health accounts.

The recent national accounts study covers the  three  financial  years  from
1996-97 through to 1998-99. The work has  afforded  us  the  opportunity  to
take a step back and to examine how things  have  been  progressing  in  the
department.  As  such,  it  allows  us  to  have  a  better  assessment   of
expenditure patterns.

The study has highlighted several significant improvements in health  sector
developments that are in line with the broad goals  that  we  have  set  for
ourselves. But the national health  accounts  also  highlight  a  number  of
challenges that are emerging within the  health  sector.  We  have  taken  a
decision to  institutionalise  the  process  of  compiling  national  health
accounts and health expenditure reviews in the department.

We shall sit as the health Minmec on an annual basis and review  expenditure
trends against our priorities. This practice should not  only  significantly
improve our understanding of the functioning of the health sector, but  also
lend significant support to the National Treasury in its  interpretation  of
the needs of our sector.

Let me  outline  some  important  landmarks  and  challenges  with  specific
reference to areas highlighted in the fiscal review. With regard  to  access
to care I might just say that since  1994  the  introduction  of  free  care
policies has  seen  significant  resources  being  channelled  into  primary
health care. This is reflected  in  the  fact  that  19%  of  health  sector
spending in 1998-99 was related to primary health care  as  against  11%  in
1993-94. Removing the barrier that fees pose to the poor was only the  first
step in improving access to care. A review undertaken within the  Department
of Health not so long ago showed that since  1995  more  than  five  million
people have experienced significantly  improved  access  to  primary  health
care services.

Much  of  this  effort  has  been  concentrated  on  improving   access   in
underserved   areas   and   historically   disadvantaged   areas.   However,
significant though our  efforts  have  been  and  as  the  Intergovernmental
Fiscal Review points out, this task is far from complete.  There  are  still
many challenges ahead and we are actively seeking to address them.

With regard to the distribution of resources, a significant  problem  exists
in the maldistribution of health professionals.  This  inequality  is  quite
stark when we start examining differences in the numbers and  categories  of
health professionals practising in urban and rural areas.  This  factor  has
significantly undermined  our  efforts  in  attempting  to  rapidly  improve
service delivery.

A key policy that has been introduced to address this is that  of  community
service. Initially community service applied only to  doctors,  but  it  has
now been extended to pharmacists. They are  doing  a  valuable  job  in  the
rural areas.

This  policy  seeks  to  place  newly  qualified  health  professionals   in
categories of work that are key to service delivery in areas where they  are
needed most. At the  last  health  Minmec  we  took  a  decision  to  expand
community service to other health professions, beginning  in  January  2003.
Next year we shall  be  tabling  amending  legislation  to  facilitate  this
programme.

A related phenomenon hampering transformation is that of  the  migration  of
skilled professionals. This takes the form  of  internal  migration  between
provinces and between public and  private  facilities,  and  also  migration
beyond the borders of South Africa.

This outflow of professionals from services that  desperately  require  them
is something that needs urgent attention.  It  highlights  the  need  for  a
strategy across the health sector and I would like to call upon  members  of
the NCOP  for  their  support  in  addressing  this  problem.  We  have,  as
Commonwealth health Ministers, established a task  team  that  is  going  to
investigate this problem, because most of our health professionals  tend  to
migrate to New Zealand, Australia, Canada or the United Kingdom. The UK  has
taken a position on this lately.

A third priority area is that of quality of care, especially in  the  Public
Service. We are committed to making significant improvements  in  this  area
between now and 2004. We have recently adopted  a  comprehensive  policy  on
quality of care. Many of the elements that are contained in the policy  have
begun  to  be  implemented  in  a  range  of  provinces,  but  they  require
reinforcement and constant monitoring in  order  to  ensure  that  they  are
sustained and expanded.

Fundamental to these initiatives is the Patients' Rights Charter, which  was
launched about 18 months  ago.  Another  set  of  interventions  relates  to
institutional reforms that we  have  implemented  in  conjunction  with  our
statutory bodies to promote and build professional development. We  are  now
busy refining a standard  complaints  mechanism  within  the  public  health
system and are promoting the practices of clinical audits and peer review.

On the issue of the revitalisation of hospitals, we include the  quality  of
care issues referred  to  earlier,  but  also,  in  general,  improving  and
rehabilitating the physical infrastructure and improving the management  and
organisational development components of hospitals.

Indeed, we are concentrating on health technology. I  would  invite  members
to  visit  a  number  of  hospitals  in  which  we  have  already  had  some
achievements with regard to revitalisation. Members would have watched  when
we launched the Kimberley hospital. It  looks  like  a  hotel.  We  need  to
congratulate them on that. [Applause.] One would also see the same thing  in
Witbank  and  Pietersburg,  because  a  number  of   hospitals   are   being
revitalised. I would just like to acknowledge the  assistance  that  we  are
getting from  the  Japanese,  particularly  with  regard  to  technology  in
Mpumalanga, the Northern Province and KwaZulu-Natal.

There was also reference to ambulances and emergency medical services.  Some
members have already referred to the fact that we  are  busy  upgrading  our
ambulance fleet and we have moved them away from the fire  brigade  services
to the departments. That makes it easier for us to be able to  respond  with
this very important and necessary service.

These initiatives are interdependent within  the  life  and  functioning  of
hospitals and we believe it is fruitless to address them in isolation.  They
require a single umbrella framework. Certainly the Department of Health  has
a crucial role to play, but we believe that the Treasury and the  Department
of Public Service and Administration also  have  valuable  contributions  to
make.

In the final instance, however, the hospital revitalisation  programme  must
be led by the Department of Health and positioned firmly within  our  policy
imperatives and service priorities.

I would like to address the question  of  inequities  referred  to  by  most
members. Indeed this is a problem, and there are  major  challenges  in  the
health sector which stem from the deep and persistent inequities that  exist
within the financing of health care -  inequities  between  the  public  and
private sectors and also between and within provinces in the  public  health
system.

We are currently reviewing the relationship between the public  and  private
sector, with the aim of realigning our activities to promote greater  access
and equity. Discussions on this matter  will  form  a  major  theme  at  the
forthcoming national health summit to be held in November this year.

When it comes to inequities  between  provinces  within  the  public  health
system, we are seriously  concerned  about  the  inequities  in  per  capita
expenditure across provinces. In the face of significant  growth  in  public
health spending, there has been a worrying decline in per  capita  spending,
and this disproportionately affects the poor provinces.

The system of fiscal federalism, which is a  feature  of  our  Constitution,
makes it very difficult for us in the health sector  to  address  issues  of
equity in financing of health services. Since  the  introduction  of  fiscal
federalism we have seen a reversal of  the  trend  towards  equity  that  we
initiated in the early years of  our  democracy.  This  divide  between  the
poorer and richer provinces is again growing wider and wider.

Although the National Treasury has initiated  a  process  of  reviewing  the
formula that is used to determine the horizontal  division  of  revenue,  we
need to do significantly more  work  in  order  to  achieve  equity  in  the
financing of health care.

Again, I would like to appeal to  members  of  the  NCOP  to  assist  us  in
addressing these complex issues.

Another issue that was raised is that of equity and conditional  grants.  We
have already embarked on a process of restructuring the  conditional  grants
that are allocated to fund central hospitals, other  tertiary  services  and
the training of health professionals. A review of the  funding  of  tertiary
services has been undertaken and it  highlights  substantial  inequities  in
the way we fund these services. We have proposed a  revision  to  the  grant
framework to ensure provinces are funded on a like-for-like basis.

It is completely unlike what Mr Redcliffe  said,  namely  that  we  have  no
vision. We have a vision. His MEC also attends these meetings  and  is  part
of these discussions. I do not understand how on earth  he  could  say  that
the department has no vision. We do have a vision. Unless,  of  course,  the
MEC does not report back to the province.

This is seen only as a first step towards achieving equity in the  financing
of tertiary services and we have proposed a  three-year  period  to  correct
the allocations. In addition to this, I have asked the  director-general  in
the presence of all the MECs to develop a  comprehensive  strategy  for  the
equitable funding and provision of tertiary services within 24 hours.

This is a very painful process as members  could  hear  from  Mr  Redcliffe,
claiming that we have no vision. It is painful for them.  It  is  a  painful
process and even at this early stage, there are  signs  of  reluctance  from
the better-resourced provinces. Let me  just  explain  what  they  do.  They
provide health care services  at  inappropriate  levels  of  care,  and,  of
course, that becomes very expensive. I can hear hon  members  moaning  about
long waiting periods for patients in the wards, but  let  me  say  that  the
Northern Cape, which has the least resources  as  compared  to  the  Western
Cape, has been able to reduce  waiting  periods  to  only  15  minutes.  The
premier has undertaken that it shall be done.  [Applause.]  They  have  also
reduced absenteeism. I therefore think it can be done. We  do  not  have  to
wait for resources to be sent to those provinces which  are  already  better
resourced than others.

Regarding personnel spending, I want to address the  challenge  relating  to
personnel budgets.  Spending  on  personnel  will  always  be  an  important
element in the budget of the health sector. There seems to  be  some  debate
on the extent and exact proportion of  spending  on  personnel.  If  present
trends continue unabated, it will put a squeeze  on  nonpersonnel  financing
available for the effective delivery of health services.

It is important, however, to recognise the fact that  personnel  expenditure
is projected to fall to levels of around 60%.  In  the  light  of  past  and
current trends in wage policy,  we  need  to  question  whether  this  is  a
sustainable goal.
Both service needs and budgetary constraints have focused our  attention  on
the need for a strategy to ensure that midlevel care workers begin  to  play
a significant role  in  our  planning  of  human  resources  for  hospitals,
clinics and community services.

I would like to deal with emerging and re-emerging diseases, which  are,  of
course, extremely important for us. I have listened very  carefully  to  all
the members talking about HIV/Aids. What I would  have  loved  to  hear  was
these members articulating what they themselves do  regarding  participation
in the implementation of Government's programme to ensure that we fight  the
spread of HIV/Aids. I do not think it  helps  if  all  of  us  sitting  here
together only say ``this is not done, that is not done''. I  think  we  need
to say what we ourselves are doing to  ensure  that  we  make  a  meaningful
contribution to the fight against HIV/Aids.

We have made a concrete proposal to the Treasury  for  funding  designed  to
secure an enhanced response to HIV/Aids,  sexually  transmitted  infections,
tuberculosis  and  malaria.  Hon  members  should  remember  that   we   are
signatories to the Abuja  Treaty.  Our  focus  is  much  broader  than  just
HIV/Aids. As part of the  Abuja  Treaty  we  signed  all  these  things  and
committed ourselves, as part of the continent, to doing them.

The document motivating for particular allocation was tabled  to  the  joint
health-treasury Minmec about two months  ago.  HIV/Aids  indeed  contributes
significantly to the mortality and morbidity burdens on  the  public  health
sector. This is squeezing out resources previously  used  for  other  health
interventions. We need to recognise this and act  consciously  to  alleviate
this pressure. This requirement is at the heart of the  current  discussions
between Treasury and ourselves as reflected in the fiscal review.

The area of tuberculosis is significant in its own right as  a  major  cause
of morbidity and mortality in South Africa and it is also important  because
of the complex relationship that exists between tuberculosis and HIV.

Sexually transmitted infections are a priority too.  There  is  indisputable
evidence that one of the more  effective  health  sector  responses  to  HIV
transmission  is  the   aggressive   treatment   of   sexually   transmitted
infections. However, it is important that, as we  deal  with  the  issue  of
HIV/Aids, TB and  sexually  transmitted  infections,  we  do  not  make  the
mistake of restricting the challenges of the health  sector  only  to  these
major problem areas.

It has repeatedly been shown that we have a complex burden of  disease,  and
this is not negated by the growing toll of HIV/Aids and related  infections.
Needless  to  say,  poverty  is  a  major  contributor  to  the  burden   of
communicable diseases. We are also strengthening  our  disease  surveillance
systems and our epidemic response, especially when dealing with malaria  and
cholera.

Our  success  in  dealing  with  cholera  primarily  through  public  health
interventions and  intersectoral  action  with  other  departments  who  are
responsible for water and sanitation is evidence of this fact.

Recently our efforts were recognised when South  Africa  received  an  award
from the World Health Organisation for our malaria programme, which  is  run
in collaboration with our neighbours Swaziland  and  Mozambique,  especially
through the Lebombo special development initiative.

The Minister and the Department of Health remain committed to ensuring  that
we continuously seek  initiatives  that  compliment  or  advance  Government
programmes  designed  to  eradicate  poverty.   The   department's   poverty
alleviation fund represents another opportunity to  go  beyond  our  current
rand-based approach to providing support  for  micro  financing  initiatives
targeted at the poorest of the poor. I urge Treasury to really assist us  in
this regard. I think the area of  micro  financing  initiatives  is  a  very
important one. I am convinced that we should not leave it to the  NGOs,  but
Government must also participate meaningfully in this initiative.
Sustained focus on the poorest among us  will  ensure  that  the  impact  of
HIV/Aids is reduced in our communities. This will  no  doubt  contribute  to
the improved health access of our underserviced communities.

The fiscal review's health chapter contains a number of subjective  elements
which I must address before closing. One relates to  inefficiency.  I  would
be the first to concede that there are areas of  inefficiency  in  terms  of
our spending in the public health system. However,  it  must  be  recognised
that we are constantly striving to improve efficiency and  good  stewardship
of resources.

We are making a concerted effort  to  bring  about  management  reform  with
strict adherence to the Public Finance Management Act.  This  work  includes
developing audit trails and appointing chief financial officers. Let me  say
that I think  there  was  a  slight  mistake  in  the  fiscal  review  which
indicated that we were way behind with regard to chief  financial  officers.
I think we are on track. We just need to accelerate the pace,  but  I  think
we are doing very well and I hope Treasury can  give  us  an  incentive  for
that.

We are also trying to decentralise  management  functions.  Several  control
systems have been developed to address wastage, especially in  the  area  of
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. Several provinces have  already  moved
ahead with a significant delegation of management  powers  to  institutional
level. We will promote this kind of management empowerment in the  remaining
provinces.

Management decentralisation could be  enormously  enhanced  if  the  various
treasuries could move more rapidly to allow revenue retention as is  already
happening, for example, in Gauteng and the  Northern  Cape,  where  I  think
they  have  been  allowed  100%  revenue  retention.  Better  alignment   of
activities of the public and private sectors should be a significant  factor
in boosting efficiency.

There is still a lot to  be  achieved  in  this  area.  However,  there  are
numerous examples of partnerships that are being forged,  and  we  discussed
this when we made our submission  to  the  select  committee.  Many  of  the
efficiency measures are very new initiatives and in most cases we  have  yet
to reap the fruits of our efforts.

The last area that I want to touch on is somewhat sensitive.  My  provincial
colleagues raised it during the select committee  discussions.  I  think  it
would answer some of the  questions  and  concerns  that  have  been  raised
around conditional grants and other grants that we manage.

This relates to spending on infrastructure and specifically the role of  the
Department of Public Works in this regard. We plan  to  further  engage  our
colleagues on this issue.

Another issue that needs immediate attention is the low level of  investment
on maintenance of our capital stock. I would be short-sighted to allow  this
to continue, and major effort is necessary to reverse this trend.

In conclusion, let me again acknowledge the importance of the work  done  by
the National Treasury and congratulate Minister Manuel. In spite of all  the
challenges, I am satisfied that we are discharging our duty to our  country.
In this regard I would also like  to  thank  my  colleagues,  the  MECs  for
health, for their teamwork in addressing  the  daunting  task  of  providing
quality health care for all our people. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE:  Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  begin  by
thanking all the members, the MECs present - I see that their  numbers  have
dwindled - representatives of provincial  legislatures,  representatives  of
organised local government and all the members in this House  for  the  work
that has been done over the past week and a half or so  in  embarking  on  a
comprehensive process of hearings on the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review.

The Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review  points  out  that  the  provinces  are
pivotal players in delivering social  services.  A  significant  portion  of
allocated funds for health, education and social development  flows  through
the provincial departments and they employ substantial staff contingents  to
administer these services.  The  review  provides  a  picture  not  only  of
progress, but  also  of  very  real  challenges.  Meeting  these  challenges
requires the necessary funding, yes, but more importantly,  also  forces  us
to address the very institutional and management issues at hand.

Solutions do not lie in money alone, and in this  regard  the  example  that
was given of the Northern Cape managing to reduce the  waiting  time  to  15
minutes is, I think, a case in point.  The  real  test  is  whether  we  can
mobilise and apply the resources with the  required  focus,  efficiency  and
innovation that would make every rand go further and bring out the  best  of
every staff member.

Regarding  the  specific  sectors  on  which  we  are  focusing  today,  the
Ministers have, of course, responded adequately  to  the  issues  that  have
been raised. I would just like to pick up on a few points  in  each  of  the
sectors that we have been dealing with today.

As far as  education  is  concerned,  and  given  the  legacy  of  apartheid
education, the transition in education over the past five years has  been  a
tough one. Not only has management improved and finances become more  sound,
but race, gender and geographic location  are  no  longer  determinants  for
access to decent schooling. Provinces have done well to provide access to  a
large number of learners. Although equity in  the  system  is  improving  it
still has some way to go, and key programmes aimed at improving quality  are
under way.

Secondly, following some stagnation in education expenditure since  1996-97,
partly due to the 1996 salary agreement, the  2000  Budget  marked  a  shift
towards renewed growth in provincial education spending  and  this  positive
trend has continued in 2001.

Real growth of 1,7% is projected for 2003-04. A further shift  in  resources
towards provincial government over the next few years will  add  impetus  to
this level of growth. Hon members must understand that when  one  speaks  of
real growth of 1,7% in the context of a budget which is above  R50  billion,
one is actually talking about a substantial amount of money. So we must  not
think that because the figure is 1,7%, that it is a small increase,  because
it is actually quite a substantial amount of money.

The third  point  I  would  like  to  raise  is  that  key  to  achieving  a
sustainable budget outlook has been the reduction in personnel costs in  the
field  of  education.  The  rationalisation   and   redeployment   programme
initiated by agreement with teacher unions has allowed provinces to  improve
the distribution  of  teachers  within  provinces  and  has  allowed  for  a
reduction in teacher numbers in certain provinces.

This  effort  has  improved  the  prospects  for  nonpersonnel  spending  in
education departments, with both capital and other recurrent spending,  such
as textbooks, growing strongly in real terms over the next few years.

The hon Sizani from the Eastern Cape raised the issue of the  importance  of
donor funds for the province to be able to  embark  on  programmes  such  as
school building. We do not often recognise  just  how  important  the  donor
funds that we receive are in enabling us to reach areas  where  our  budgets
are often unable to reach. I know that a few  years  ago  the  Eastern  Cape
actually did not have a capital budget for schools, and the only money  that
was available was money from various donor countries,  from  the  EU,  Japan
and so on.

I do want to record in this House that we do receive substantial amounts  of
donor funds and they  play  a  very  important  role  in  supplementing  the
budgets that provinces and departments have. What we have sought to  do  has
been to try to ensure that there  is  some  co-ordination  with  our  budget
priorities. In many cases we have managed to make those donor  funds  become
actual budget support. That is how the degree of  alignment  has  progressed
in certain areas.

If the hon member Helen Zille had been here, I would have  agreed  with  her
on a number of points she raised. She raised the point about the  efficiency
of spending. She even compared us to Senegal and Zambia. That is true.  Part
of the legacy of South Africa, in the fields of  education  and  health  for
example, is that while we spend  more  resources  than  countries  that  are
comparable to us, the outcomes thereof have  been  poorer  in  South  Africa
than in some of those countries. So, I would have agreed with  her  on  that
point, and this applies to both education and health.

But, of course, she must also admit that this is a  historical  problem.  It
is not a new problem. It is part of the legacy that we are  trying  to  deal
with. I think that these are some of  the  things  which  our  trade  unions
should also be seized with to ensure that we improve  the  effectiveness  of
the spending of the resources that go into education, including  our  school
governing bodies and other stakeholders.
The other point which I would have liked to pick up on was the  point  about
the Cuban core of teachers to help us develop our own teachers. I know  some
people sneer at the idea of getting experts from Cuba. The  point  about  it
is that best practice does not always necessarily reside or  does  not  only
reside in the traditional developed  countries.  So  we  will  go  for  best
practice where we believe that it will benefit us.

Regarding social development, the expanding role of the social grant  system
in fighting poverty cannot be doubted. Compared to most other  middle-income
countries, South Africa  has  a  large  state  welfare  system.  I  want  to
emphasise this. This is a unique programme that we  have  in  South  Africa,
especially the non-contributory old age grant. One does  not  find  this  in
many countries comparable to  us.  The  biggest  component  focuses  on  the
payment of noncontributory old  age  grants,  disability  grants  and  child
grants to poor people.

Each month close to 4 million people,  or  nearly  10%  of  our  population,
receive cash grants. Numbers are growing by more than 60 000 a month as  the
child support grant is phased in, and will reach more than  6  million  over
the  next  two  years.  Welfare  services'  funding   of   private   welfare
organisations and state-provided services for aspects such as  placement  of
orphans, institutional care, rehabilitation and counselling play  a  smaller
but critical role.

Social development expenditure continues to fluctuate around  90%  of  total
provincial expenditure, and ranges from as high  as  22,5%  in  the  Eastern
Cape to around 14% in Gauteng. The different proportions  reflect  different
demographic structures and levels of  poverty.  For  example,  KwaZulu-Natal
has a bigger proportion of older people and, as  a  result,  a  lot  of  the
budget is consumed by ensuring that one gets these grants to those people.

These are some of the demographic differences. The explanation for  this  is
that amajaha [well-built men] of my age go and  work  in  Johannesburg,  but
when they get older they come back to the province. These are  some  of  the
things that we are beginning to see in the differences in the budgets  spent
by different provinces. This is why Gauteng is spending,  for  example,  14%
on welfare payments.

On average, more than 90% of Social  Development  expenditure  goes  towards
cash grants. Some provinces, such as Gauteng and the  Western  Cape,  manage
to spend larger proportions on social welfare services.  In  spite  of  some
progress towards greater equity between provinces in levels of  expenditure,
spending per poor person between the  provinces  remains,  however,  unequal
and requires further attention.

Following  slower  spending  since  1997,  the  year  2000-01   reflects   a
turnaround with real growth returning to the aggregate welfare budget  after
two years of real decline. So, we do accept that there has  been  a  decline
in welfare budgets. This trend continues  over  the  medium-term.  Over  the
three-year period, nearly 3% real growth per year is  expected.  Again,  the
most significant growth is  generally  in  the  provinces  where  there  are
backlogs and where access needs to be facilitated, for example,  Mpumalanga,
the North West and the Northern Province.

The administrative system, payment system and paypoints in  particular  have
received substantial attention. This relates  to  unsatisfactory  conditions
at paypoints, for example, the unavailability  of  shelter  and  sanitation,
the  outsourcing  of  grant   payments   to   private   firms,   fraud   and
administrative actions in some provinces.

The  national  department  is  currently  taking  initiatives   to   support
improvement in service delivery. Chief financial officers are  in  place  at
appropriate levels in most provinces  and  requirements  for  submission  of
financial statements were generally  complied  with.  This  is  one  of  the
positive results that we are beginning to see  from  the  implementation  of
the Public Finance Management Act because now, two months after the  end  of
the financial year, most departments are  able  to  submit  their  financial
statements. Previously, it could be anything from six to  18  months  before
financial statements could be submitted. This  is  a  positive  development.
Change and the introduction of new things always create difficulties, but  I
think  that  we  must  acknowledge  those  areas  where   there   has   been
improvement. [Applause.]

The adequacy of the social safety net and the  fact  that  many  poor  South
Africans do not qualify for benefits are  currently  being  investigated  by
the committee of investigation into a comprehensive social security  system.
A variety of options are being analysed for addressing, in  a  comprehensive
way, the problems of poverty and inequality. Some  initiatives  are  already
in place to deal with the  impact  of  HIV/Aids,  such  as  the  funding  of
community- and home-based care options.

The issue that I would want to pick up in the  matters  raised  by  the  hon
members here is that of the child support grant. A  point  has  been  raised
about the fact that the child support grant only  goes  up  to  the  age  of
seven. Yes, that is true. Another point about the need for  us  to  consider
raising that age to 18 has also been raised. I think that that  was  one  of
the Minister's parting shots, if I can put it like that.

What I would just like to raise with members of this House is  that,  as  we
look at this issue of the child support grant which supports children up  to
the age of seven, we must not close our eyes to the fact  that  we  do  have
the primary school nutrition programme, and part  of  the  challenge  is  to
make sure that that primary school nutrition programme functions  much  more
effectively. We can extend its reach and ensure that we give better food  to
children at school. I just wanted to caution hon  members  that  we  do  not
only have to at the issue of extending the age, but also look at  the  other
instruments  that  we  have  in  order  to  deal  with  children   who   are
disadvantaged.

I also think that we must recognise that we are a government.  A  government
does many things. There are trade-offs. We  can  make  any  decision  around
this issue. We could decide to extend the age  to  18,  and  recognise  what
that  will  immediately  do  to  the  numbers.  The  numbers  will  increase
substantially. At the same time, the Minister  was  demanding  increases  in
the amounts as well. I think  that  part  of  what  we  need  to  do  is  to
recognise that there are trade-offs to be made, and we must  approach  these
things collectively so that the decisions that we make  are  decisions  that
will ensure that we are also able to fulfil our other responsibilities.

We must always recognise the fiscal impact  of  the  decisions  and  choices
that we make on other sectors. I have just said that  we  are  a  Government
and have many responsibilities to look after.  I  think  that  part  of  the
issue that faces us is: What is it that we are trying to do as a country  or
as Government? Surely, we are not constructing what can be called a  welfare
state. We would not like to generate a nation of people who  are  dependent.
Part of what we do in the short  to  medium  term  to  alleviate  issues  of
poverty, etc, is to do all the other things that  will  ensure  that  people
have employment opportunities and generate income for  themselves.  That  is
part of the challenge. I am saying that we must cast our eyes wide  when  we
deal with these issues and not just look at one particular  instrument  that
we have.

Another issue that I wanted to pick up - unfortunately the  hon  Kondlo  has
left - is the decline in the provincial share. [Interjections.] Who  is  the
hon member pointing at? [Interjections.] No, I am referring  to  hon  Kondlo
from the Eastern Cape. Maybe I should have said it in  isiXhosa.  The  point
is about the decline in  the  provincial  share.  It  is  only  a  temporary
phenomenon and already, over the medium term, we are beginning  to  see  the
provincial share rising over the three-year period.  I  did  want  to  point
that out.

Regarding the issue of information that was not  reflected  on  the  Eastern
Cape in the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review, we are  fairly  confident  that
the information that we have in this fiscal review is  reasonably  accurate.
The  reason  for  that  is  that  the  process  of  compiling  all  of  this
information is a collaborative process. We do not just sit in  the  Treasury
and compile these numbers. We get these  numbers  from  the  departments  at
national and provincial levels. So I think that if there is  something  that
we did not reflect it may be because that thing  was  not  supplied  to  us.
Even after drafting the document,  we  supplied  the  departments  with  the
relevant chapters so that they could comment. I think that hon members  have
heard the Minister of Health saying so.

But one of the things that  this  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  raises,
because there are areas where we have difficulties in  getting  information,
for example specific information on the  budgets  of  hospitals  and  around
some  of  the  nonfinancial  information,  is   just   the   centrality   of
information. The importance for all of us at local, provincial and  national
government  level  -  all  departments  -  is  to  collect  and  disseminate
information. This is because part  of  what  the  lack  of  availability  of
information means is that even our managers at those levels at which  we  do
not have the information do not use that information. It  is  critical  that
one of the things that we learn from this process is that  it  is  important
for  us  to  collect  information,  because  information  is  an   important
instrument, even enabling us to evaluate  our  policies  or  to  refine  our
policies, and sometimes perhaps to even change the direction and so  on.  So
I wanted to highlight those particular points as far as  social  development
is concerned.

As far as health is concerned, there is a marked  resumption  of  growth  in
health expenditure. After some stagnation  again  in  the  area  of  health,
health expenditure increased by 9,6% in 1999-2000, and 2000-01, and by  8,8%
in 2001-02.

Strong real growth in health budgets occurred  prior  to  1997-98.  But  the
impact of salary negotiations put substantial pressure on this  sector.  The
result was strong cutbacks in health personnel, constraints on  capital  and
maintenance  spending,  and  real  declines   in   spending   on   supplies,
particularly medicines. This is reflected by the expenditure data  of  1998-
99. I hope that this helps us to recognise the importance that we  must  pay
to managing our spending on personnel,  because  it  is  easy  to  spend  on
personnel. It is one of the easiest things to do. It is much easier than  it
is to spend on building a school,  clinic,  road  or  something  like  that,
because those require certain skills, more planning and  more  time.  It  is
important that we really pay attention to the issue  of  managing  personnel
spending.

Provincial health budgets are set to grow again by 1,7%  per  year  in  real
terms over the medium term. This turnaround will  be  strengthened  by  more
moderate growth in personnel expenditure  as  the  costly  wage  progression
system comes to an end.  While  the  proportion  of  provincial  expenditure
going towards health strengthened in 1999-2000,  the  share  of  the  sector
comes under pressure over the period 2003-04.

Following the comments in the hearings, I would like to  bring  to  members'
attention how the various concerns that had  been  raised  are  being  dealt
with. Firstly, there is much  co-operation  between  the  Treasury  and  the
Department of Health to ensure that health budgets  are  adequately  catered
for. This includes ensuring adequate funding for  the  primary  health  care
budgets, which can be dealt with through more  detailed  budget  information
for what are programme 2 items: district health care  in  provincial  health
budgets. Subprogrammes will provide more information,  and  strategic  plans
to be tabled with the budget  could  provide  better  district  information.
These reforms should also ensure better information on the school  nutrition
programme.

Secondly, detailed work has been undertaken with the  Department  of  Health
to support restructuring of the central hospitals grant. The aim is  a  more
equitable funding of tertiary  services  and  improved  access  to  tertiary
services.

Thirdly,  a  detailed  research  project  has   been   undertaken   on   the
distribution of tertiary services expenditure in  the  country.  This  shows
certain inconsistencies between existing grant allocations and  expenditure.
For example, the Eastern Cape  province  spends  R481  million  on  tertiary
services,  but  only  receives  R13  million.   Proposals   are   close   to
finalisation  to  integrate  the  central  hospitals  grant  fund  and   the
redistribution of specialised services grant into a  new  national  tertiary
services grant. These will be detailed  in  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement. Also, infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance  remain  high
on the agenda, and financing mechanisms will be reviewed over  the  next  12
months.

HIV/Aids is currently being confronted in the health sector, mainly  through
expenditure by provincial health departments on Aids-related  illnesses  and
opportunistic infections, and through prevention activities  funded  by  the
national Department of Health, and through the  special  allocation  for  an
integrated plan.

The special allocation flows mostly  to  provinces  as  conditional  grants.
While most of the required initiatives are in place,  there  is  a  need  to
build on this basic capacity, move beyond piloting and expand the  scale  of
programmes. Substantial work has been done to allow progress in this  regard
in the current budget process.

In spite of important gains in the health sector, equity remains a  pressing
concern. Both spending figures and other indicators of  input,  for  example
the availability of highly skilled medical  staff  that  the  chair  of  the
committee was talking  about  and  hospital  beds  by  province,  illustrate
unequal access to services and quality differentials between provinces.

The National Treasury is  interacting  with  the  Department  of  Health  to
address pressing inequities in specialist  medical  personnel,  and  further
information on this will  be  released  in  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement. It must be noted that many of the underlying problems may not  be
financial, as the distribution of doctors and specialists indicates.

Resolving  these  nonfinancial  problems,  like  attracting  and   retaining
personnel,  is  critical  to  ensuring  progress  towards   better   equity.
Substantial progress has been  made  towards  a  greater  focus  on  primary
health care. Policies introduced include, of  course,  free  primary  health
care, free services to mothers and young children, a  large  clinic-building
programme and restructuring of hospital services.

Service levels received ongoing attention as well. There  is,  for  example,
increased availability of ante-natal care, improved  turn-around  times  for
various tests and wide implementation of  the  directly  observed  treatment
system for tuberculosis. There has also been an improvement in  availability
of doctors at clinics, a marked increase in availability of  electricity  at
clinics, and some increase in availability of  condoms,  oxygen,  penicillin
and oral contraceptives. Some concerns remain, including record keeping  and
basic equipment.

I have a few final points that I would like to make. Firstly, I  would  like
to address myself to the hon Ackermann. With quite  a  loud  voice  he  said
that apartheid was being blamed for everything. What I would like to say  is
that what is most important about this Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  is
that it is about us, what we have done. It is about us  evaluating  what  we
have done since we became the new Government. [Interjections.]

And so one must never glorify apartheid or even  pretend  that  things  were
better during apartheid, because many people in this  House  will  tell  one
how different that reality was. The most important thing is that this  is  a
much more open society, a much more open and transparent Government  and  we
report about what we do; we even report about our own failures, and that  is
very important.

I think that the issue about this Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review  is  that
the overall picture that emerges from this document is one of  progress.  It
is one of progress and also of challenges. It also reflects  a  growing  and
maturing intergovernmental system as shown by more and better quality  joint
Minmecs. We have had quite a lot of joint Minmecs  in  the  course  of  this
year, with education, with health, with  social  development,  with  housing
and so on.

The quality of these joint Minmecs has improved. So I think  that  there  is
also a maturing of the  intergovernmental  system.  Part  of  what  we  must
recognise particularly as this House is that there is a series of  documents
that we now have in the course  of  the  year  at  our  disposal.  With  the
budget, we table the Estimates of national  expenditure,  which  essentially
give  us  the  policy  priorities,  the  programmes,  and  the  budgets   of
departments, and what departments plan to achieve over the medium term.

This is an important document that we must interact with. We also  have  the
Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  and   the   Medium-Term   Budget   Policy
Statement. At the  end  of  the  day,  all  of  these  documents  must  mean
something to us. They must assist us in the work that we are  doing.  It  is
important to emphasise that this Intergovernmental Fiscal Review should  not
be the end of it. It is something that, as committees,  we  should  continue
to work with in the provinces, our legislatures and  local  governments  and
so on, because it really gives us  important  non-financial  information  as
well.
To end, I really must thank all of the members and  express  the  hope  that
following this particular debate we can continue  reflecting  on  what  this
document has highlighted. The last point that I would like to make  is  that
a member here made reference to a report of the  Medical  Research  Council.
The point that I would like to make  is  that  when  one  talks  about  that
report, it is not as though Government is sitting and  doing  nothing  about
establishing the impact of HIV/Aids on our society.  In  fact,  the  Medical
Research Council was part of a wider process involving Statistics SA and  so
on.

That process is still on course and we expect its results. It  must  not  be
as though, because the Medical Research Council has decided  to  table  this
report, the Government is not doing anything to try  and  measure  what  the
impact of HIV/Aids is on our country. [Applause.]

              FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (PROTECTION OF FUNDS) BILL
                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, Deputy Minister of  Finance,  special  delegates
and colleagues, this Bill is, in essence, an  updated  streamlining  of  the
Financial Institutions (Investment of Funds) Act of 1984, which will now  be
repealed. The Financial Institutions Act is a statutory codification of  the
law of trusts as applicable to financial institutions  and  deals  with  the
fiduciary  duties  of  persons  dealing  with  funds  and   trust   property
controlled by financial institutions.

These include aspects  such  as  good  faith,  proper  care  and  diligence,
declaration of private interests and the requirement that third-party  funds
or trust property should be invested separately. In Chapter 1 of  the  Bill,
the  provisions  of  the  Financial  Institutions  Act   relating   to   the
safekeeping and administration of funds  and  trust  property  by  financial
institutions have been refined and rewritten in clearer language.

The second chapter of the Bill makes significant extensions with  regard  to
the registrar's powers against contravening parties and  provides  for  more
effective enforcement measures  and  oversight  by  the  Financial  Services
Board. In the first instance, the powers have been extended  to  enable  the
registrar to act also against parties  functioning  outside  the  regulatory
net. It will now be possible to establish a curatorship over  the  so-called
associated institutions and/or unregistered institutions.

Although the Act previously  contained  provisions  granting  the  registrar
locus standi to institute civil proceedings such as  to  interdict  a  party
from contravening the law, the Bill now makes provision for  further  powers
which, inter alia, enable the registrar to call for  specified  information,
or to require a party to appear before the  registrar  for  questioning  and
even to apply to a court for an order restraining the conduct  of  business.
The registrar is, furthermore, given the power to declare certain  practices
irregular or undesirable, and to have the names of  transgressors  published
after certain audi alteram procedures have been applied.

This ``name and shame'' possibility will serve as  an  additional  deterrent
to individuals who may contemplate improper  behaviour.  In  addition  to  a
severe penalty of 10 years which may be imposed on a transgressor,  such  an
individual may be ordered  by  the  court  to  refund  profits  made  or  to
compensate whoever suffered damage as a result of the contravention.

The Bill does not have any organisational or personnel implications for  the
state, other than to reduce the burden of the courts in  removing  the  duty
to exercise control over  curators,  neither  does  it  have  any  financial
implications for the state.

No objections were received by the Select Committee on Finance, and  it  was
passed unanimously.  The  select  committee  recommends  that  the  Bill  be
supported.

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                       ALEXKOR LIMITED AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr S L E FENYANE: Chairperson, I know it has been a hard long day.  However,
I have no choice but to go through my speech. Hon members should  bear  with
me.

We indeed live in exciting times. Success in any endeavour is  not  certain,
neither it is guaranteed. Successful concerns in the private and the  public
sector are those that are able to embrace the philosophy of  the  futurists,
when they posit cogently that:


  The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read  and
  write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn.


  Business concerns and the broader public are presently challenged, in the
  words of Prof. Nick Binedel:


    ... to identify  what  practices  and  skills  will  work  in  the  new
     environment, which is rapidly propelled hither and thither  by  furious
     technological development. They are expected to identify practices that
     do not work. Thereafter,  they  should  forthwith  abandon  those  with
     clinical precision and, in the process, learn a whole new set of skills
     that are necessary  to  survive  even  the  outbreak  of  unanticipated
     eventualities, such as the September 11 New York city catastrophe.  The
     modern world readily punishes those who  do  not  plan  and  anticipate
     probable future scenarios.

It is against the backdrop of these factors and  other  realities  that  the
Department  of  Public  Enterprises  has  introduced  the  Alexkor   Limited
Amendment Bill to Parliament. The Bill in front of us  seeks  to  amend  the
obsolete  provisions  of  the  Alexkor  Limited  Act  of  1992.  That   Bill
effectively imposed restrictions on the disposal of Alexkor shares  held  by
the state, in that it compelled the Minister to first list  Alexkor  shares,
and only then could he/she dispose of those shares. The  proposed  amendment
enables the Minister for Public Enterprises to sell the  state's  shares  in
Alexkor without having to traverse the listing route.

The  Bill  is  not  prescriptive,  but  merely  enables  the   Minister   to
restructure Alexkor within the broader  restructuring  policy  framework  of
the Government. I would also like to indicate that, at this point  in  time,
Alexkor is operating at a loss and that the Government  is  painfully  aware
that the greater Namaqualand community depends entirely on Alexkor  for  its
livelihood. Government will try everything in  its  power  to  maintain  the
economic viability of Alexkor for the benefit of the Namaqualand  community.
This will be done in partnership with the community  in  a  manner  that  is
transparent and fair. Various options will have to  be  considered,  but  it
should be stated that,  contrary  to  perceptions,  the  Government  is  not
privatising Alexkor.
It should be noted, in particular, that  this  endeavour  by  Government  to
resuscitate the economic revival and self-sufficiency of Alexkor  is  not  a
nuanced attempt to shed jobs. I would like  to  indicate,  without  implying
any subtle pun or equivocation, that the intention of the Government  is  to
save jobs and promote the economic revival of Alexkor.

The local government there has been duly consulted on  this,  and  it  fully
supports Government on this aspect. I  would  therefore  like  to  urge  the
House to support the passage of this Bill.

In the interests of saving time, seeing that members are  very  tired  right
now, I would like to move that we support this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

         The Select Committees on Finance, Public Services,  Provincial  and
         Local Government, Housing, Education  and  Social  Services  having
         considered and examined the Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review  2001,
         referred to the Select Committee on Finance, reports as follows:


         Chapter 1 Introduction


         This  intergovernmental   fiscal   review   provides   the   unique
         opportunity for the NCOP to exercise an  oversight  and  monitoring
         function over executive in Parliament. It affords  the  members  of
         parliament and civil society to  interact  with  the  issues  below
         with the view to  strengthen  the  oversight  role  of  members  of
         Parliament. It provides a platform for all  spheres  of  government
         to raise issues on the provision of basic services  and  value  for
         money and to what extent  has  it  translated  into  improving  the
         lives of the poor.  To  try  and  answer  questions  posed  by  the
         Minister of Finance raised on the 9 October and the  constitutional
         mandate of government on improving peoples lives.


         In line with the hard decisions made in 1996 through  the  adoption
         of GEAR. The following questions arise:  what  are  the  challenges
         that are confronting us as government and the nation at large.


         Competing Priorities


         There are a great  deal  of  competing  priorities  that  we  as  a
         country needs to be financed, yet we have so much. The question  is
         which ones are the most important and which ones are not.


         Chapter 2 Key issues for committee consideration


         2.1     Roads development


         Roads and transport planning remains one of the key  post-Apartheid
         challenges. The challenge relates not only to  backlogs,  but  also
         to the spatial environment and the quality of community life.
         There  has  been  a  historical  backlog  in  the  maintenance  and
         improvement  of  roads.  Road  development  is   disaggregated   as
         national, provincial or local  government  responsibility;  Current
         institutional arrangements are inadequate  to  further  develop  or
         build  new  roads   because   the   categorization   of   national,
         provincial, rural access, minor and roads further complicates  road
         upgrading, maintenance and building.


         National government will build a road in a province  but  does  not
         take responsibility  to  maintain  the  road.  On  the  other  hand
         provinces are not provided with the finances to maintain the  road.
         For example in the case of rural roads there is no ownership  as  a
         consequence  it  remains  neglected.  There   should   be   clearer
         guidelines governing  the  National,  Provincial  and  local  roads
         especially where national roads run thorough rural  towns  and  are
         not maintained by anyone.
         Trucks regularly exceed the  56  ton  allowed  by  SANDRA.  Traffic
         officers  need  to  bring  the   perpetrators   to   book   because
         overloading seriously damage the roads.


         Subsidy  on  buses,  taxis  not  subsidized  government  should  be
         looking at subsidizing transport for the poor. More money  goes  to
         busses and yet people who are being subsidized use taxis. A  review
         of the subsidies becomes necessary.


         Moreover, the Department is keen to promote the  concept  of  inter
         modular forms of transport with special emphasis on commuter  rail,
         which implies the leveling of the field between road and rail  form
         of transport. In this light, commuter rail  is  being  restructured
         and  its  recapitalisation  requirements  are  being  addressed.  A
         capital  expenditure  programme  was  initiated  to  renew   ageing
         rolling stock and enhance safety  levels.  Metrorail  coaches  have
         also been upgraded.
         2.2     Social Development


         Social Development is the one area where  government  can  directly
         attempt to  remove  or  at  least  try  to  eradicate  poverty  and
         inequality. In keeping with the restoration of equity  and  poverty
         eradication, the National Budget is primarily dedicated to  health,
         education   and   social   development.   Expenditure   on   Social
         Development was in 2000/2001 was R20.929 billion and  the  clearest
         indication that Social Development is geared towards  strengthening
         safety  nets  and  improving  the  quality  of  service   delivery.
         Presence of refugees gives rise to Xenophobia. ANC Policy  to  take
         care of  all  regardless  of  origins  especially  those  from  the
         continent who assisted ANC in exile.


         2.2.1   Response to HIV/AIDS


         Transforming our response to the  impact  of  HIV/AIDS  has  become
         fundamental when the statistics show that more people are dying  of
         AIDS than had  previously  been  the  case.  The  strength  of  the
         response will  not  only  lie  with  ensuring  that  medicines  and
         medical care is being directed to those who have  the  disease  but
         becomes more holistic.


         Caregivers are fundamental in the departments response. In  keeping
         with  African  tradition,  the  caregivers  come  from  the   local
         communities and surviving relatives who have to  give  up  jobs  to
         take  care  of  the  sick  and  dying.  The  department's  response
         combined with those  of  the  Department  of  Health  has  been  to
         develop a comprehensive Home-and Community Based Care programme.


         The Minister of Social  Development  and  most  of  the  MEC's  and
         provinces have raised concerns that the Social Security  System  is
         not tailored for HIV /AIDS pandemic and careful decisions  need  to
         be made  for  the  allocation  of  funds  need  to  slot  into  key
         programmes such as the Home and Community  based  programmes,  care
         for  AIDS  orphans,  financial  assistance  for   children   headed
         households and education  geared  towards  the  prevention  of  new
         cases of HIV positive individuals.


         The Director General of Social Development has indicated  that  the
         implementation of Home  and  Community  based  care  has  not  been
         smooth and this is an area but that the matter is receiving  urgent
         attention. But the intention from the  departments  of  Health  and
         Social Development is that this program covers both a  stipend  for
         the caregiver as well as a medical kit  and  food  parcel  for  the
         patient.


         2.2.2   Social Grants


         This section, for most of the provinces, represents  about  90%  of
         provincial budgets. Often this grant is the only source  of  income
         for many impoverished people especially those in the  remote  rural
         areas. Government has recognized this need and thus  social  grants
         forms part of governments'  poverty  relief  strategy  directed  at
         improving the lives of people.


         The system of social grants is more equitable now than before  1994
         and the number of beneficiaries have increased  dramatically  since
         then, but some inter-provincial inequities still prevail.  The  per
         capita allocation differ dramatically when one compares the  richer
         provinces like  Gauteng  and  the  Western  Cape  with  the  poorer
         provinces like Free State.


         Despite the inequities the figures show that  by  July  2001  there
         were  approximately  4  million  beneficiaries   receiving   social
         grants. The dramatic increase in this grant  is  due  primarily  to
         the  phasing  in  of  the  Child   Support   Grant.   These   grant
         applications have reached the 1 million mark.
         Most social grants have increased to the  level  of  inflation  but
         serious discussions are currently being held between the  Ministers
         of Finance and Social Development in an  attempt  to  increase  the
         designated amount.  There  is  currently  a  Committee  of  Inquiry
         investigating a comprehensive social security system  and  part  of
         their brief is to take into  account  the  age  implications.  This
         report will be due shortly.


         The introduction of Norms and Standards that  have  been  developed
         by Social Development is currently being piloted  and  will  ensure
         that grants will be administered in the  same  or  similar  way  in
         every province.


         2.2.2(a)      Child Support Grant:
         The phasing out of the Child Maintenance  Grants  have  highlighted
         some of the challenges facing social  grants  because  the  current
         CSG  system  does  not  reach  children  over  7  years  and  those
         receiving the grant complain that it  is  very  low.  A  number  of
         provinces have recommended that both the amounts for  these  grants
         be increased as well as the possibility  of  raising  the  cut  off
         age, possibly to the age of 18 years.


         Most provinces that have large  rural  components  raised  concerns
         about the tenuous relationship  between  Home  Affairs  and  Social
         Development.  Of  necessity  a  very  strong   inter   departmental
         understanding should  exist.  In  the  instance  of  Child  Support
         Grants  the  lives  of  babies  are  literally  dependent  on  both
         departments  acting  speedily  to  process  and  administer   these
         grants.


         Documents such as Birth Certificates and ID books for  parents  are
         important tools necessary for efficacy  in  the  administering  the
         CSG. Some provinces have cited delays,  few  Home  Affairs  offices
         and incompetence within the department of Home Affairs  jeopardizes
         the application process leading to,  in  the  worst-case  scenario,
         fatalities or in most instances, continued hardship for the poor.


         A concern raised by the Director General of Social Development  was
         that should all provinces overcome  the  current  inefficacies  and
         the levels of processed applications finally reach  all  the  areas
         they  ought  to,  the  department  will  have  to   reexamine   the
         allocation  for  CSG's  because  the   demand   will   exceed   the
         allocation.


         2.2.2(b)      Disability Grants:
         Some of the amendments to Social Security  Act  take  into  account
         those provinces that do not have easy access to District  Surgeons.
         What the Department seeks to provide in  the  absence  of  District
         Surgeons, are panels that would be able to  access  and  adjudicate
         those applicants who hope to qualify for  disability  grants.  This
         process was piloted in a few provinces and will be  implemented  in
         December 2001.


         2.2.2(c)      Foster Care Grants:
         There is an increasing demand for Foster Care Grant from  relatives
         and community members having to care for children  who  lost  their
         family and friends through AIDS  related  deaths.  Currently  court
         procedures are complicated and lengthy  and  applicants  experience
         difficulties with magistrates. The South African Law Commission  is
         investigating the matter and will report to the Minister of  Social
         Development. There are also ongoing discussions with  the  Minister
         of Justice to assist in alleviating the problem.


         2.3     Education


         2.3.1   Introduction


         The Review emphasizes the Department's consolidation over the  last
         five years, specifically transformation balanced against  the  need
         for universal access, greater equity  and  improved  quality.  This
         has been well managed through cooperative governance.


         What is of particular significance, is that in terms of  historical
         spending trends since the  1996/7  financial  year  when  education
         spending went up by 22% in  real  terms,  there  has  been  a  2,4%
         decline between 1997/8 and  2000/1.  This  can  be  ascribed  to  a
         variety of factors, for example teacher  rationalisation,  improved
         financial management, greater powers were given to parents  in  the
         managing of schools and the launch of the Tirisano  campaign.  This
         has resulted in a  much  more  stable  education  system  in  which
         budgets are more sustainable and balanced.


         2.3.2   Non - Financial Indicators in Education


         Non-financial indicators give the public additional information  to
         judge provincial education departments' performance.  Recent  years
         have seen an improvement in  the  data  available  on  a  range  of
         issues such as those listed below.


         2.3.2(a)      Per learner comparisons and enrolments


         As for spending per learner, the provincial  average  is  estimated
         at R 3 658. With the average learner spending in the Northern  Cape
         the highest. Gauteng and the Western Cape are amongst  the  highest
         whereas KZN, the Eastern Cape and  Northern  Province  are  amongst
         the lowest. It is therefore important that consideration  is  given
         to  these  factors  when  allocations  are  made  to   the   poorer
         provinces. Government should find ways to bridge  this  gap.  These
         disparities  can  largely  be  attributed  to  the  disparities  in
         enrolment rates, the cost  of  teachers  and  relative  priorities.
         Poorer provinces are encouraged to work harder in this  regard.  In
         general the school enrolment increased from 1994  with  a  peak  of
         12.3 million in 1997, but it is  set  to  fall  to  10  million  in
         years.


         2.3.2(b) Teachers and classrooms


         The teacher-learner ratio also declined in all provinces from  33,7
         to 32,7. However, the classroom-pupil ratio is still  significantly
         higher due to excess teachers in some provinces.  For  example  the
         Northern Province has 20% more teachers than  classrooms,  hence  a
         good pupil-ratio but classrooms are still overcrowded.


         When it comes to allocations, poor provinces are to  be  considered
         first need fluid ways to bridge these gaps.


         2.3.3   Physical infrastructure


         Since 1996  about  25  102  new  classrooms  have  been  built  and
         significant increase in the provision  of  telephones,  sanitation,
         running water and electricity can be reported.  It  is  however,  a
         decline in the physical condition of schools that is of  particular
         concern, for example schools needing repairs went up to 10  500  to
         12 100 and those classified as weak from 3000 to 7000.  The  number
         of schools with computers went from 2 241 to 6 581.  Gauteng  being
         one of the financially stronger provinces tops the list  with  only
         16% of schools with no computers as opposed  to  the  Eastern  Cape
         with 84%.


         2.3.4   Crime


         Crime has cost provinces a loss of R155 million in  the  year  2000
         with 2 540 burglaries while 5000 assault  cases  were  reported  of
         which 1860 were serious crimes. Communities should  take  ownership
         of  schools  and  school-governing  bodies   should   be   properly
         empowered to drive this initiative.


         2.3.5   Matric results


         The results for  the  year  2000  were  on  the  whole  impressive,
         however the number of candidates not passing maths and  science  is
         cause for concern. Ditto for the low  female  learners  take-up  of
         these subjects. There is growing concern that the  female  learners
         are still experiencing discrimination reporting  high  school  drop
         out rates, exchanging  sexual  favours  for  lifts  to  school  and
         accepting gifts from bus and taxi drivers.  Provincial  departments
         must look at providing safety nets for these vulnerable learners.


         2.3.6   Conclusion with regard to the education sector


         The tough consolidation period is over resulting in a  more  stable
         and a better managed education system. The budget trends  over  the
         MTEF  look  positive.   Treasury   advised   that   investment   in
         infrastructure, systems  and  maintenance  precede  the  hiring  of
         teachers.


         While the Review admits that a  great  deal  of  improvements  have
         been made in terms of delivery in education a number of  challenges
         remain i.e. shortage of learning  support  materials,  insufficient
         transport,  inadequate  classroom  ablution  facilities  at   rural
         schools,  shortage  of  suitably  qualified  teachers  in   certain
         provinces and a lack of mathematical and scientific literacy.


         The Honourable Minister  Asmal  expressed  his  concern  about  the
         extent  to  which  bureaucratic  red  tape   and   poor   financial
         management systems hampered  delivery  in  the  provinces.  He  was
         especially concerned about the slow  procurement  and  distribution
         of learning support materials. No province was singled out  but  it
         was in clear reference to those provinces that  are  annually  left
         with rollovers in their  budgets.  As  a  means  to  address  these
         weaknesses he  proposed  that  the  various  departments  introduce
         training programmes and facilities for especially  those  officials
         at middle mangagement  levels.  He  also  undertook  to  set  up  a
         scrutiny committee to deal with the general  state  of  laxness  in
         the some of the provinces.


         2.4     Housing


         2.4.1   Institutional challenges


         Housing remains one of  the  key  post  apartheid  challenges.  The
         challenge relates not only to backlogs, but  also  to  the  spatial
         environment and the quality of community life.  Alongside  national
         and  local  government,  provinces  play  a  role  particularly  in
         providing housing. Since 1994, government has contributed  to  over
         1,2 million low cost houses, providing shelter to  over  5  million
         people.  This  reduced  the  housing  backlog   significantly   and
         translates to providing shelter to an estimated one  out  of  every
         eight people. These new housing projects could be  the  conduit  to
         deracialising societies.


         The  housing  sector  faces  notable  institutional  challenges  of
         delivery  and  accountability;  these  include   the   consolidated
         municipal infrastructure programme (CCMIP) and social and  economic
         infrastructure that contribute to the  development  of  sustainable
         human settlements. Under spending over the  last  three  years  has
         improved  largely  as  a  result  of  improved  capacity   in   the
         provinces. However,  highest  under  spending  during  2000/01  was
         recorded in the Northern Province as the result of floods.


         2.4.2   The housing subsidy grants


         The 1999 October household survey shows certain patterns in  access
         to  housing,  water  and  electricity.  These  patterns   partially
         reflect the impact of housing delivery on overall quality of  life.
         The proportion of households living in  formal  dwelling  showed  a
         gradual increase from 65,8% in 1995 to 69% in 1999.  On  the  other
         hand the number of household living in informal dwelling  has  also
         increased, as the pressure for shelter is  experienced  across  all
         types of housing. The 2001 review informs  us  that  no  new  homes
         were constructed during the current financial  year  in  the  North
         West province. The MEC informed the meeting that  8379  homes  were
         built in the year under review.


         The variation in the pace of delivery is also evident of  rollovers
         in housing subsidy funds. Where provincial housing departments  had
         rollovers over 2,2 billion or 71 %  of  allocated  housing  subsidy
         funds in 1995/96, they have estimated rollovers of 590  million  of
         15% in 2000/01. It is clear from this  that  certain  obstacles  to
         sustainable delivery has been identified and  government  continues
         to explore ways to speed  up  deliver  and  to  contribute  to  the
         development of sustainable human settlement.


         Financial management in the sector has improved. Further steps  are
         being taken to improve and streamline the funding arrangements  for
         housing programmes. These include converting  the  housing  into  a
         conditional grant resulting in all  funds  received  by  provincial
         housing  departments   being   deposited   into   the   appropriate
         provincial revenue fund, improving accountability over such  funds.
         It must also comply with national norms and standards.


         2.4.3   Obstacles to delivery


         One of the most problematic obstacles to delivery is the  delay  in
         land transfer process, which is necessitated by  legal  aspects  of
         land transfer.


         The  recent  local  government  elections  had  impacted  badly  on
         delivery  of  houses  and  municipality  delays  in  approving  new
         housing programmes as a result of non-payment  of  property  rates.
         This projects a negative picture, which government  does  not  care
         about the poor.


         Secondly,  with  regard  to  programmes  approved   and   subsidies
         allocated, it  has  been  established  that  there  is  a  lack  of
         communication from the provinces to the people,  such  that  people
         are not informed of their allocations and they take  part  in  land
         invasions, whereas their houses are ready for occupation.


         Natural phenomena such as floods and tornadoes  resulted  in  under
         utilisation of conditional grants (Department  of  Housing  in  the
         Eastern Cape,  Northern  Province  and  Mpumalanga).  Although  the
         duration of natural disasters was  short,  the  periods  in  delays
         were logically beyond the incidence of the disaster itself.


         *  One of the most critical obstacles is the double  allocation  of
              houses.


         *  Lack of  co-ordination  across  the  sphere  of  government  and
              sectors.


         *  Fraud and corruption should be addressed in  the  allocation  of
              houses.


         2.5.    Health


         2.5.1   Primary health care budget:


         The Conditions in  Clinics  for  primary  health  are  not  of  the
         standards that government has expected.  The  principles  of  Batho
         Pele are not adhered to with patients  being  treated  without  the
         quality of care contained in these principles. Care must  be  taken
         to  ensure  that  patients'  rights  are  not  trampled  upon.  The
         minister of health appealed to all parties in  all  provinces  play
         the necessary oversight and monitoring  role  to  ensure  that  the
         rights and principles contained in the Patients Rights Charter  are
         protected  and  adhered  to  thereby  ensuring  that  patients  are
         treated with care.


         2.5.2   Hospital Reconstruction and Rehabilitation:


         Currently  income  generated  by  hospitals  are  not  retained  by
         hospitals but revert back to  treasury.  Maintenance  funds  should
         not be transferred to Public Works, but the department  of  Health.
         The  department  of  health  relies  almost  exclusively   on   the
         department of public works  to  maintain  health  facilities.  This
         handicaps  the  department  of  health  who  has  to  rely  on  the
         programme of public works before  necessary  upgrades  and  repairs
         can be done. Provinces have appealed that this should  be  reviewed
         and that maintenance and upgrades should be the  responsibility  of
         the department of Health and not Public Works. Some  hospitals  are
         under severe pressure because of infrastructural  problems  because
         infrastructure is not properly maintained.


         Provinces have developed  the  ability  to  spend  and  procurement
         takes six months so it is crucial that  provinces  have  medium  to
         long-term  plans  for  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation   plans.
         However all of these plans need  an  indication  from  Treasury  if
         province will be eligible for money.


         The  minister  encouraged  provinces  to   examine   private/public
         partnerships to fund priority projects.


         2.5.3   Recruitment and Retention of Skilled personnel:
         The legacy of  apartheid  still  manifests  itself  in  the  skewed
         distribution of professionals in the  country.  The  emigration  of
         young professionals is a major cause  of  concern.  They  cite  the
         increase in crime as a reason  for  leaving,  however  crime  is  a
         global phenomenon.


         The  enticement  offered  by  other  countries   is   a   universal
         experience. The quality of training in South Africa  is  very  high
         so  countries  like  England  offer  package  deals  to   potential
         emigrants in the hopes of enticing them to England.  South  African
         professionals should  follow  the  example  set  by  Cuban  doctors
         deployed to the remote rural areas of our  country  who  display  a
         sense of duty and commitment to  their  own  country  and  also  to
         ours.


         The Minister  and  some  of  the  provinces  thought  that  it  was
         important that the Minister of  health  offer  incentives  to  both
         community doctors and those who have been around  for  a  while  to
         encourage  equity  between  provinces.  Because   rural   provinces
         experience difficulties in retaining doctors both the Minister  and
         the  MEC's  appealed  to  these  people  to  develop  a  sense   of
         patriotism and consciousness so that they could give  back  to  the
         communities what they had learned.


         The spread of doctors across the  country  favour  those  provinces
         with a large urban areas leaving the rural provinces with a  skewed
         patient to  doctor  ratio.  The  rural  provinces  have  doctor  to
         patient ratios that are well below the requirements  of  the  world
         health organisation requirement for developing countries.  Need  to
         development a sense of patriotism coupled with incentives.


         2.5.4   Human Resources Development Programme:


         Leg and rank promotions  have  presented  enormous  constraints  on
         provincial budgets. Already personnel expenditure is a  very  large
         percentage of the budget. The department needs to  examine  if  the
         high cost for personnel is justified in terms of value  for  money.
         And on the flip side, are staff members encouraged to stay  because
         salaries are market related. The health sector  has  reported  that
         they experienced loss of key posts.


         The employment of Chief Finance Officers has  helped  provinces  to
         manage better fiscal discipline. Some  rural  provinces  would  not
         have been able to cope with the demands  for  doctors  had  it  not
         been for the departments policy of Community  Service  and  use  of
         foreign doctors. The minister is speaking  to  Treasury  to  retain
         incentives without perverse taxation liabilities,


         2.6.    Local Government


         2.6.1   South African local government  has  been  undergoing  some
                profound changes in the past years. Transformation at  local
                government has happened in several  ways  e.g.  financially,
                institutionally  and  developmentally.  Municipalities   are
                playing an increasingly important role in service  delivery,
                eradication of poverty and improving the social and economic
                conditions of South Africans. Many new functions  are  being
                decentralized to local government, giving  municipalities  a
                more integrated package of services and functions to manage.
                A major fiscal challenge is to support these  roles  through
                effective revenue mechanisms.


                Together with the  White  Paper  on  Local  Government,  the
                Municipal Demarcation Act, the Municipal Structures Act  and
                the Municipal Systems Bill are the  building  blocks,  which
                have created the vision and the way forward  for  the  post-
                transitional local governance.


                This system of governance is based on:


         *  Working with local citizens and communities to find  sustainable
              ways to meet their needs and improve the  qualities  of  their
              lives;


         *  Finding new ways to  accelerate  and  sustain  the  delivery  of
              services, particularly to the poor.


         The  Intergovernmental  Fiscal   Review   therefore   provides   an
         important step in looking at the effectiveness  of  and  efficiency
         of resources applied in different spheres of governance  so  as  to
         make sure that, transformation does take place. It also  highlights
         the following fiscal realities  that  need  to  be  considered  and
         addressed to secure the sustainability of transformation:


         *  Demarcation has created 284 new municipalities,  each  of  which
              now has to amalgamate staff from previous structures,  refocus
              strategic   plans   and   budgets   and    align    themselves
              organizationally to new  roles.  The  shifting  functions  and
              changes to boundaries have distinct  financial  and  personnel
              implications.


         *  In line with the  constitution,  many  national  and  provincial
              departments are considering which of their functions are  best
              performed in the local sphere. Functions under review  include
              housing delivery, primary health care and the district  health
              system, water and municipal policing. Personnel and  financial
              implications  must  be  considered  before  deciding  on  such
              decentralization.


         *   The  transfer,  movement  and  placement  of  staff  in   newly
              amalgamated  municipalities  have  added  upward  pressure  to
              equalize salary and other employer benefits. Already personnel
              costs have been the foremost cost driver for municipalities in
              recent  years.  This  affects  the  scope  to  expand  service
              delivery as budgets come under pressure.


         *  The major urban municipalities have distinct revenue  generating
              powers and are only marginally  dependant  on  transfers  from
              national   government.   Many   rural   and   smaller    urban
              municipalities however have much weaker  fiscal  capacity  and
              depend considerably on  transfers  from  national  government.
              Government's commitment to assist in  the  provision  of  free
              basic services requires implementation of focused and targeted
              fiscal and other programmes in all spheres of government. This
              does not however alleviate the  need  for  improved  financial
              management locally and  for  municipalities  to  spend  within
              their budgets and collect revenue due.


         *  Local government budget information is often  not  reliable  and
              is currently fragmented as the newly demarcated municipalities
              are amalgamating. Outdated budgeting systems and  inconsistent
              accounting or budgeting practices and systems  translate  into
              poor recording  of  data  and  inaccurate  planning  and  make
              benchmarking,  comparisons  and  tracking  of  funding   flows
              difficult.


         *  Affordability is a  major  issue  and  the  situation  has  been
              aggravated  by  ongoing  increases  in   bulk   prices   (e.g.
              electricity  and  water)  that  ultimately  are  passed   onto
              municipalities  and  their   consumers.   For   example,   the
              government has contributed to more than  1,1  million  housing
              opportunities since 1994 and provided many  social  and  basic
              services, but the beneficiaries can often not afford municipal
              service charges.


         *  The impact of HIV/AIDS is becoming more visible  and  is  likely
              to be severely impacting in the provincial and local spheres.


         *  Although budgeting on the expectation of  collecting  all  their
              revenue, many municipalities  do  not  collect  a  significant
              portion of revenue due. This results in deficits at the end of
              the financial year, undermining  the  financial  stability  of
              municipalities.


         *  Capital spending has been declining as  a  percentage  of  total
              spending. High personnel spending means less is available  for
              service delivery and capital development.


         *   Net  private  lending  to  the  municipalities   has   remained
              virtually flat for at least four years.  Investors  have  also
              had doubts about the financial viability of municipalities  in
              transition and about the legal  regime  related  to  municipal
              debt. DBSA and INCA currently dominate the market.


         *  Local government budgets often  show  clear  intent  to  address
              backlogs and poverty alleviation, but poor  spending  capacity
              often results in these intentions not being realized. This  is
              particularly   true   of   poorer   provinces    and    weaker
              municipalities.


         2.6.2   Municipal transformation challenges


         (i)     Cross border problem
         The existence of cross border municipalities is the outcome of  the
         recent demarcation process of local  government  institutions.  The
         boundaries extend to more than one province thus  causing  problems
         as to which municipality is accountable.


         (ii)    Service Delivery


         Municipalities face a range of  competing  pressures  on  resources
         available for service delivery. Reforms to municipal  planning  and
         budgeting processes are being introduced to  assist  municipalities
         to make these trade offs on the basis of  clear  policy  priorities
         and local context.


         The key trade off required is the relative importance  attached  to
         service  quality  and  equity  objectives.   On   the   one   hand,
         municipalities must maximize  resources  available  to  expand  and
         sustain  access  for  the  poor   households.   However,   non-poor
         consumers also demand improvements in the quality  of  services  to
         which  they  already  have  access.  These  consumers  provide  the
         economic base  of  a  municipality  and  thus  continue  contribute
         significantly to its revenue. Declining service quality  is  likely
         to undermine both local economic performance and payment  morality,
         thus jeopardizing the effective tax base of a municipality and  its
         ability to pursue equity objectives.


         As with other spheres of government, resources  available  to  meet
         these pressures are limited in  the  short  term.  This  highlights
         efforts to effect medium to long-term  adjustments  to  expenditure
         pressures facing municipalities.


         The importance of establishing effective local government in  rural
         areas  cannot  be  overstated.  In  these  areas,  the  absence  of
         formally  planned  settlements  means   that   revenue   generation
         potential  is  low,  institutions  weak   and   service   provision
         differently structured and priced. The local  revenue  sources  are
         limited  and  do  not   adequately   cover   basic   administrative
         requirements. During the current year,  these  municipalities  have
         also been affected by uncertainties associated with the  transition
         and funding of free basic services. This situation is under  review
         at ministerial level.


         (iii)   Expenditure Pressures


         (a)     Personnel Challenges: Municipalities employ in  total  over
              200 000 people: about 109 000 in category B municipalities and
              8 000 in district councils. Despite concerns  that  the  large
              share of personnel threaten to squeeze out  service  delivery,
              salaries continue to make up the largest  share  of  municipal
              expenditure and continue to rise faster than inflation.


         (b)     Shifts in municipal powers and functions:


              *   Powers and functions of  non-metropolitan  municipalities:
                  The shifting of powers and  functions  between  categories
                  of   non-metropolitan   municipalities,   either   through
                  demarcation or sectoral policy reforms, is  a  significant
                  challenge.


              *     Decentralization   or   devolution   of   functions   to
                  municipalities: Restructuring of service delivery is  also
                  under  consideration  in  various  sectors,  with   likely
                  implications for municipalities. Proposed  initiatives  to
                  transfer water  services,  devolve  health  functions  and
                  regionalize electricity distribution  could  fundamentally
                  alter  the  role   of   municipalities   with   associated
                  implications for staffing and expenditure needs.


         (c)     Free basic services: The challenges  of  municipal  service
              delivery  are  broader  than  the  commitment  to  free  basic
              services alone. These services are critical  inputs  to  local
              economic  activity  and  thus  national  economic  growth  and
              development.


         (d)     Allocating subsidies efficiency: The efficiency with  which
              services and subsidy resources are allocated among  households
              has  a  significant  impact  on  the  total  cost  of  service
              delivery. The  challenge  is  foremost  to  ensure  that  poor
              households are  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  free  service
              policy and associated resources.


         (e)      Bulk  Supply  Costs:  Price  increases  for  bulk  service
              purchases  by   municipalities   have   placed   pressure   on
              municipalities, as they cannot  always  pass  higher  bulk  of
              costs on to consumers  without  experiencing  a  rise  in  non
              payment levels,  political  resistance  or  lower  demand  for
              services.


         (iv)    Transitional Costs associated with amalgamation


         Transitional  costs  associated  with  amalgamation:   Amalgamating
         former  municipalities  involves  some  complex  issues,  such   as
         consolidating assets and liabilities on a single balance sheet  and
         balancing extended service provision with levying  of  taxes,  fees
         and charges across diverse communities. Vastly  increased  property
         rates  and  service  charges  could  affect  the  affordability  of
         services, particularly for poor households.


         2.6.3    Intergovernmental   Fiscal   Review   Hearing   on   Local
                 Government
         I. Key issues discussed


         (i)     Department of local Government


         The government's priority of transforming  society  was  expressed.
         The commitment to improve the lives of people was  also  reassured.
         The Deputy Minister stressed the importance of the budget  used  as
         a tool to address the legacies of  the  apartheid.  She  reaffirmed
         the importance of reforming the budget, because the  way  in  which
         the system of local government was structured in the past was  such
         that it catered for the  best  interest  of  the  minority  at  the
         expense of the majority. Thus, there was and  there  still  is  the
         need for restructuring. She highlighted some  of  the  consequences
         of the past apartheid legacy,  namely,  backlogs,  poverty  in  the
         rural areas, urbanization etc.


         The following concerns were expressed:


         *  That some of the critical pressures are on expenditure as it  is
              felt  that  it  is  spent  more  on  personnel.  The  minister
              expressed that there is a need for more  efficient,  effective
              and accountable personnel for implementation but a balance has
              to be stricken between the expenditure on  personnel  and  the
              governments commitments to  service  delivery.  Therefore,  in
              determining the budget, the two have to be weighed.


         *  The importance of investment in the rural areas.


         *  The clarification of the functions and powers  of  district  and
              local municipalities to assist planning and budgeting  and  to
              create certainty for investors.


         *  Grants need to be coordinated and better targeted.


         *  A distinct clarification of the role of Traditional leaders  and
              municipalities, as there have been reports of  overlapses  and
              clashes, which have caused problems in some of the provinces.


         *   That,  an  empirical  study  in  each  municipality  is   being
              conducted to look at their financial structure  to  assist  in
              the budget allocation. People involved  include,  Departments,
              Provinces, FFC, demarcation boards.


         *   There  are  also  certain  functions  passed  by  the  national
              governments on local governments but they are not followed  by
              finances.


         *  That, local government plays an important role in  the  delivery
              of basic  services  especially  with  regards  to  free  basic
              service. This area requires adequate financing.
         *  The most impoverished areas  at  the  moment  are  the  Northern
              Province and the Eastern Cape. The need for  sufficient  funds
              allocated in the impoverished provinces was expressed. What is
              crutial is that delivery should be able to provide services in
              an integrated setup. The measuring  inequalities  present  the
              greatest ongoing challenge.


         *  Provisions like electricity be  accompanied  with  finances  for
              infrastructure.  Not  all  areas  can   get   private   sector
              participation. A problem of loans by the Development Bank  and
              INCA to larger municipalities was expressed.


         *  That municipalities must develop  credible  IDPs  that  link  to
              their budgets and that take available resources into  account.
              IDPs should be used to determine backlogs.
         *  Cross boundary issues are becoming a problem.


         *  The  need  to  accelerate  budget  reform  was  expressed.  With
              regards to the Budget reform, no final plans have  been  made.
              Probably be done by 2002 March. Not an easy  process  as  some
              councils are still new and others new to this area.  The  fact
              that Reform takes time was expressed. They are  looking  at  a
              period between 5-10 years.


         *  The need for use of information technology  in  collecting  data
              so as to minimize the inaccurate data. The programme  that  is
              envisaged at the moment is networking forum.


         *  There was concern  expressed  with  regards  to  the  Regulation
              council. It was proposed that the Revenue Collection System be
              improved to look at monitoring people to pay services. It  was
              acknowledged that the main reason that people do not  pay  for
              services is poverty.


         *  Upgrading of services and the quality of services was  expressed
              but that also needs funding.


         *  The Department is concerned about the decrease  in  spending  on
              capital  infrastrure  in  municipalities.  This   can   affect
              delivery  of  service.  The  uniform  approach  to  budge   is
              important.


         *  With regards to equitable share, there has  been  some  increase
              but it is not enough.  Ideally  it  should  be  used  for  the
              provision of delivery of basic services. Now it  is  used  for
              personnel expenditure.


         *  Rationalization of transfers. Transfers are  being  consolidated
              to ensure that they effectively  support  a  municipal  sphere
              that serves communities best and that addresses the  needs  of
              the poor. The report shows that however,  many  transformation
              issues require very careful consideration to ensure  that  the
              new structures are fiscally sustainable.


         (ii)    Department of Water Affairs


         The Minister highlighted the  following  areas  of  provincial  and
         local government as areas in which they work:


         *  Waste management and control over water pollution;
         *  Support to irrigation farming;
         *  Conservation forestry;
         *  The Department's Working for Water Programme  is  essentially  a
           focused nature conservation programme and nature conservation is
           a concurrent function with the provinces;
         *  Water supply;
         *  Sanitation service provision.
         The following were identified as areas in which the  department  of
         Water Affairs works with Department of Local government:


         *  Providing basic funds for basic needs water schemes.
         *  Operating water sanitation schemes  where  local  government  is
           not yet willing or able to take them over.
         *  Establishing a  family  of  regional  utilities,  water  boards,
           multi jurisdictional service providers to provide services where
           local government does not want to provide the service itself.
         *  Training capacity building for local government  at  the  levels
           of councilor, official, technician and artisan.


         The following concerns were raised:


         *  That the review's focus is on  urban  municipalities  where  the
           bulk of expenditure occurs rather than on the rural and district
           system where  the  major  challenges  of  service  delivery  and
           poverty eradication are located.
         *  That revenue generation  potential  in  the  rural  areas  where
           majority of the people reside is low, institutions are weak  and
           service provision is generally both more complex and more costly
           as a result of the absence of formally planned settlements.
         *  That  the  funding  available  to  municipalities  serving  such
           communities is limited and does not adequately cover their basic
           administrative requirements. As a result  funding  intended  for
           this purpose is used for other purposes.
         *  That these municipalities have been  affected  by  uncertainties
           about the mechanisms for the allocation of the equitable share.
         *  The report  does  not  recognize  the  importance  of  directing
           resources towards building up local government as  a  sphere  of
           governance. The vertical split of nationally revenue  raised  is
           as follows: National Government (R84,3b), Provincial  Government
           (R117,4  b)  and  Local  Government  (R6,5b).  To  expect  local
           government to both become properly established and  to  function
           as the key developmental wing of government  requires  resources
           on a larger scale. The equitable share  (R3,4b),  infrastructure
           grants (R2.4b) and current transfers (R0,6b) need to be  doubled
           to address the transformation needs of local government.


         2.6.4   Cross-sectoral issues in the provinces


         Many of the  issues  that  provinces  and  local  governments  face
         transcend sectors and  departments.  This  section  of  the  report
         focuses on these more general issues.


         2.6.4.1 Integrated Development Strategy


         The crucial element of any integrated strategy is  that  while  co-
         operation is  required  within  the  social  sectors,  coordination
         amongst the different spheres of government is  equally  necessary.
         There has to be  both  vertical  (across  sectors)  and  horizontal
         (across spheres) co-ordinations simultaneously. This  is  the  most
         daunting task confronting any government in transition and no  blue
         print exists for such undertaking.


         2.6.4.2 Public-Private Partnership (PPP)


         The PPPs are dependent on at least three conditions:


         *  An operational need for private sector  skills  to  deliver  the
           service
         *  An identifiable market of private  sector  bidders  prepared  to
           compete for the project
         *  Appropriate allocation of risks


         In order for PPPs to be approved by  the  relevant  Treasury,  they
         must demonstrate:


         *  Affordability
         *  Value-for-money
         *  Transfer of appropriate  financial,  technical  and  operational
           risk to the private party


         2.6.4.3 Beneficiaries of social security grants and bank charges


         Members  of  the  Select  Committees  were  concerned   that   poor
         beneficiaries of social securities are  still  burdened  with  bank
         charges if their social grants are collected from the  conventional
         banking sector.


         2.6.4.4 Redistribution of personnel to rural areas


         For example  in  the  health  sector,  although  the  extension  of
         primary health care has made basic health care more  accessible  to
         all South Africans, significant inequity  remains.  Private  health
         care system only allows access  to  less  than  25%  of  all  South
         Africans. With less funding the public sector has  to  care  for  a
         much larger number of people than the private  sector.  The  Review
         tells us that  the  distribution  of  all  health  professionals  -
         doctors, specialist, dentists and nurses is  highly  uneven  across
         provinces and between urban and rural areas. The 2001  Review  tell
         us that just over 50  percent  of  fixed  clinics,  46  percent  of
         satellites and 69 percent of mobile clinics serve rural areas.


         2.6.4.5 Maintenance of existing infrastructure


         There can be little argument against the  maintenance  of  existing
         infrastructure. There is also a general believe that it would  make
         economically more sense to invest in the  maintenance  of  existing
         infrastructure and to  do  so  immediately  when  deterioration  is
         first detected.  A  delay  in  response  to  the  deterioration  of
         infrastructure  will  only   increase   the   economic   costs   of
         maintaining such infrastructure.


         It may also cancel out some of the benefits  government  sought  to
         give  previously  disadvantaged  communities   through   the   many
         infrastructural development initiatives it implemented in terms  of
         the RDP.  The  maintenance  of  these  infrastructural  development
         programmes is essential  if  previously  disadvantaged  communities
         are to continue benefiting from those developments.


         Recommendations


         With regard to local government, the Select  Committee  on  Finance
         argues that while the 2001 Review provides useful material on  past
         municipal budgets, the focus from next year on will  shift  to  the
         post-demarcation bodies.


         The Select Committee on Finance would recommend the  following  for
         the future issues of the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review:


         -  Future reviews should include data  for  the  newly  amalgamated
           municipalities with a greater focus on non-financial performance
           measures to help gauge efforts to address the  service  delivery
           goals.


         -  The Review should continue  to  be  developed  as  a  source  of
           information on progress with reforms, such as service  delivery,
           systems reform and redistribution in the local sphere.  As  this
           year's shows, priorities are:


         -  A national study with regard to the subsidization  of  the  poor
           over and above the concept of free basic services  for  all,  be
           undertaken within all municipalities  to  determine  the  extent
           thereof.


         -  While a significant amount  of  cost  is  funded  through  local
           taxes, a vast number of municipalities do not have adequate  tax
           bases to address these challenges. SALGA is of the view that  an
           alternate source of revenue be identified to finance the gaps in
           social and economic development.


         -  The equitable share must be  increased  to  make  provision  for
           allocation to District Municipalities.


         With regards to  the  transport  sector  the  Select  Committee  on
         Finance recommends the following:


         *  A more detailed study should be undertaken by the Department  of
           Transport to assess what is the maximum load permissible on  our
           roads. Excess roads do damage road surface and South Africa  has
           the second highest maximum loads permissible in the SADC region;


         *  The appropriate Select committee  should  assess  what  progress
           has Department of Transport made establishing new  institutional
           arrangements for roads development. The real  issue  is  whether
           our institutional arrangements are appropriate  to  ensure  that
           money budgeted for roads are actually spent!


         *  Approach the National Treasury for  a  written  comment  on  the
           slowness of cash flows during the disaster period;


         *  Attempt a follow-up  with  the  transport  department  on  their
           progress to reform the bus subsidy programmes;
         *  If other modes of transport (such  as  bicycles  and  rail)  are
           priority, then a redirection of grants  should  receive  serious
           attention;


         *  Pursue the appropriate national  departments  on  the  committee
           alternative suggestions  with  regards  to  combing  appropriate
           provincial MECs or have a dedicated road institution.


         Education recommendations:


         The bureaucratic tape and poor financial management systems  should
         be eliminated in order to  fast  track  delivery.  Procurement  and
         distribution of learning support materials should  be  prioritised.
         A means of addressing these weaknesses  is  to  introduce  training
         programmes for  especially  those  officials  at  middle-management
         level.


         Housing:


         An in principle policy decision has been taken that 0.5% -  07%  of
         the  provincial  budget  has  to  deal  with  emergencies  such  as
         disasters.


         *  All applications should be captured in a  database,  which  link
           all the provinces to avoid this double allocation.  It  is  both
           the National and Provincial government working together to solve
           such problems  as  housing  delivery  is  a  priority  for  both
           National and Provincial departments.


         *  The department has  shifted  from  its  policy  of  quantity  to
           quality as envisaged by  the  fact  that  speeding  up  delivery
           compromises the quality of houses.


         *  MEC's have to facilitate the  problems  related  to  bureaucracy
           such as delays in approving new housing programmes as  a  result
           of property rates.


         *  The Minister has also recommended  that  women  in  housing  are
           promoted and not marginalized.


         *  Due  to  the  increase  in  shelter  demand,  the  upgrading  of
           informal settlements should be prioritised so as to bring  water
           and sanitation.


         *  It has been agreed that provinces should indicate problems  they
           experience so that the Minister can be aware of them such as  in
           the case of the Minister of land affairs who is helping with the
           issue of R281 certificates to speed up the process.


         *  There should be a standard payment system in place  to  minimise
           fraud.


         *   Guidelines  with  regard  to  the  special  needs  of   certain
           categories of historically disadvantaged people  such  as  women
           and the disabled, in the  allocation  of  houses,  should  be  a
           priority.


         *   Local  government  should  comply  with  National   norms   and
           standards in housing and not raise standards which  have  caused
           the collapse of projects.


         *   Local  government  should  avoid  paying  a  lot  of  money  to
           consultants.


         *  The devolution of  responsibilities  should  be  accompanied  by
           reciprocal funding.


         With regards to the cross-sectoral issues  in  the  provinces,  the
         following have to be investigated:


         *  A discussion document on  both  vertical  (across  sectors)  and
           horizontal (across spheres) co-ordinations be produced;


         *  Investigate the progress in provinces  towards  finalisation  of
           PPPs;
         *  Appeal to provinces,  national  and  provincial  departments  to
           display better  utilisation  of  allocated  financial  resources
           instead of continuously demanding for additional assistance;


         *  Investigate the  possibility  of  instituting  legislation  with
           regard to  excess  bank  charges  for  beneficiaries  of  social
           security grants;


         *  Explore what pressure still exists to expand personnel costs;


         *  Explore whether rural health facilities are adequately  equipped
           for incoming medical personnel to carry out their functions;


         *  Pursue the feasibility of national  department  undertaking  the
           functions of child feeding scheme.


         Hospital Reconstruction and Rehabilitation:
         -  Maintenance funds should not be  transferred  to  Public  Works,
           but the department of Health.
         -   Maintenance  of  all  health   institutions   should   be   the
           responsibility of the department of Health and not Public Works.
         -  Now that provinces have  developed  the  ability  to  spend  and
           procurement takes six months, it is crucial that provinces  have
           medium to long-term plans. However all of these  plans  need  an
           indication from Treasury if province will be eligible for money.


         Recruitment and Retention of Skilled personnel:


         -  Need to develop a sense of patriotism  coupled  with  incentives
           Equity.
         -  Identify clear targets  as  in  IGFR  coupled  with  a  sensible
           increase in conditional grants.
         -  Low per capita spending should be redressed with the new  census
           figures so that provinces that have received low allocations can
           have their budgets increased based on more realistic  population
           figures.


         Local Government:


         -  The role and responsibilities of local government  needs  to  be
           clearly defined to facilitate Integrated Development Planning.


         HIV/AIDS Conditional Grant:


         -  Should be immediately implemented in all provinces.


         District Health Services and Municipal Health Services:


         -  The process of District Health Services should be accelerated.
         -   Municipal  Health  Services  should  be  defined   quickly   in
           consultation with municipalities and their related associations.


         The Select  Committee  on  Finance  together  with  other  relevant
         Select  Committees  should  undertake  a  visit  to  provinces   to
         investigate the following:


         *  Upkeep of State owned properties
         *  Conditions of classrooms
         *  Availability of water and sanitation facilities
         *  And any other matters relating to infrastructure provisions


         C) Conclusion


         We would like to thank the National Treasury on the release of  the
         third the Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  2001.  It  has  helped
         members to look at the social services sector  critically  and  has
         observed that committees need to  play  an  active  role  in  their
         oversight work over these issues. We hope that the next  IGFR  will
         be released on time so that more discussions could take  place  and
         cover other sectors like agriculture, environment and tourism etc.


         The 2001 review offers a good start, and is a  fertile  ground  for
         comprehensive  and  robust  analysis   since   this   non-financial
         approach to assessment of programme  is  in  its  infancy.  Further
         adjustments can be expected in future Reviews.


         This report will form part of the discussion documents  during  the
         MTBPS hearings due to be conducted by the budget committee.


         This was the first of its kind and there is room for improvement.


         We  would  like  to  thank   all   the   participants   for   their
         contributions in particular  the  Ministers,  MECs  and  provincial
         standing  committees.  We  thank  all  the  researchers,  committee
         section  and  government  officials  for  their  sterling  work  in
         preparing for the hearings and this report.
