                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting  of
the House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that National  Police  Commissioner,  Jackie  Selebi,  informed
       Parliament that the SA  Police  Service  needs  16  250  more  police
       officers to stabilise the crime situation in the country;


  (2) further notes that the Minister of Finance informed the Council  that
       the provinces lacked the capacity to spend their combined R10 billion
       capital budget; and


  (3) in  the  light  of  the  aforementioned  facts,  resolves  to  debate
       realigning the national Budget accordingly.

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, at the next sitting of the House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with deep concern a media report  in  the  Sunday  Times  on  4
       November 2001, stating that  teacher  deaths  due  to  HIV/Aids  have
       rocketed by more than 40% in the past year, according  to  statistics
       compiled by the largest teacher trade union in South Africa, Sadtu;
  (2) welcomes the stated intention of Mr Willie Madisha, Cosatu and  Sadtu
       president, to call upon the Government to  declare  Aids  a  national
       emergency as so many young teachers are succumbing to  the  epidemic;
       and


  (3) calls upon the  national  Minister  of  Education  to  intensify  the
       Ministry's programme to raise awareness  of  the  disease  among  the
       teaching fraternity and to create an environment where the stress  of
       secrecy around HIV can be removed and where  collegial  understanding
       and empathy prevails.

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I humbly give notice that at  the  next  sitting
of the House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes and appreciates  the  bold  step  taken  by  the  Western  Cape
       transport MEC, Piet Meyer, in distancing himself from careerists  and
       opting for a route which will bring about greater  stability  in  the
       province;
  (2) congratulates Mr Meyer on recognising that dignity is more  important
       than salary and status; and


  (3) welcomes Mr Meyer's resignation and calls on all parties to  remember
       that being constructive and refraining from pettiness  will  overcome
       the huge challenges facing this nation.

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, at the next sitting of this House I will move:


  That the Council -


  (1) calls upon the SA Police Service, the Financial Services  Board,  the
       insurance industry and the  funeral  industry  to  co-ordinate  their
       efforts to put an end to racketeering in  the  industry  and  to  act
       against grave robbers that dig up and recover coffins and resell them
       to an unsuspecting public; and


  (2) notes that malpractice surrounding the funeral  industry  is  causing
       trauma to many families and is giving the whole burial and insurance-
       related industry a bad name.

                      LEAKED MATRIC EXAMINATION PAPERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

       in some schools in Gauteng and Mpumalanga;


  (2) further notes the negative implications of this matric  exam  scandal
       for the students involved, parents and the school as a whole;

       of our education system; and


  (4) appeals to the Education department at all levels to see to  it  that
       this horrible act by people who want to enrich themselves by  selling

                    INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  I  take  this
opportunity to welcome the hon the Minister of Trade and Industry.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, colleagues  in  the  House,
this Bill makes certain relatively  limited  amendments  to  the  Industrial
Development Corporation Act. The most important of these amendments, from  a
practical point of view, is the extension of  the  mandate  of  the  IDC  to
Southern Africa and other parts of Africa.

The  Industrial  Development  Corporation   is   our   premier   development
corporation and, I think, in world terms, would hold its own with its  track
record. In the period since 1994 it has accounted for approximately  10%  of
gross fixed capital formation in the economy, and last year alone  accounted
for 5,9% of gross fixed capital formation.

The IDC has undergone a number of changes, particularly since  1995-96,  and
I believe it is an improved organisation. We  have  modernised  it  in  many
respects and we are widening its mandate to take into  account  contemporary
critical  policies  such  as  empowerment,  support  of  small  and   medium
enterprises and the support of our regional investment initiatives, such  as
SDIs and IDZs.

This Corporation, as many would  know,  is  an  old  corporation,  with  the
initial Act passed in 1940. There is clearly some  scope  for  updating  and
modernising the Act. Our intention is that as the IDC has changed, we  will,
as I have indicated in the other House, consider further amendments to  this
Act at a later stage. Currently, however, we have  limited  them  to  a  few
specific areas which we  believe  are  operationally  important  to  get  us
moving, particularly, as I mentioned earlier, the investments in Africa.

I think we should bear in mind, however,  when  considering  the  Industrial
Development Corporation, that it  is  a  development  financing  institution
that functions as a fully autonomous cost-recovery corporation.  It  is  not
an institution  that  is  subsidised  by  the  Government.  This  Government
provided the initial capitalisation many years ago. It pays a  dividend,  it
pays tax and functions as a development financing corporation. We expect  it
- and this is its mandate -  to  undertake  its  activities  in  a  correct,
prudential manner, with a clear assessment of  the  economic  and  financial
viability of projects. So we cannot expect at any time that  the  IDC  would
undertake  a  whole  range  of  different  activities.  It  is  a  full-cost
financing operation owned by the state and it has proved, I think, to  be  a
very effective instrument.

I would urge  colleagues  in  this  House  to  support  these  more  limited
amendments. They will allow  us  to  undertake  important  projects  in  our
neighbouring states, and in fact they will allow us also to  undertake  some
important projects in Africa, that are  currently  under  negotiation.  This
will, no doubt, support the New Partnership for  Africa's  Development.  The
IDC can play a very important role in that regard. [Applause.]

Mr  M  V  MOOSA:  Mr  Chairperson,  first  of  all,  I  want  to  start   by
congratulating the Minister on introducing this Bill  into  Parliament  this
year. It indicates that we are  constantly  reassessing  and  reviewing  our
state  corporations,  and  that  we  are  looking  at   where   the   market
opportunities are and what needs to  be  done  with  these  corporations  to
achieve our overall national economic strategic objectives.

I would like to just quickly state,  for  the  benefit  of  members  of  the
House, that the IDC was formed in 1940 through legislation.  It  is  an  old
organisation. One of its main objectives was to find  opportunities  in  our
market  that  were  not  exploited  and  to  exploit  those   opportunities,
strengthen and grow them in order to create jobs and so forth.

However, more recently, we found that  there  were  a  number  of  strategic
things that needed to be done. For example, our economy is opening  up  into
Africa.  Can  our  corporations  move  into  Africa   to,   firstly,   build
infrastructure,  capture  economic  opportunities  and  participate  in  the
economic development of the continent? With the amendments that  we  brought
about in this Bill, we will be able to do so.

However, there are so many other things that have been added into this  Bill
which members, particularly those from the provinces, would be very keen  to
know about. For example, the IDC is now, specifically by law,  empowered  to
promote economic empowerment of historically disadvantaged  communities.  By
law,  it  is  required  to  foster  the  development  of  small  and  medium
enterprises in our  country;  to  promote  employment  creation  activities,
particularly  in  underdeveloped  areas;  and  to  leverage  foreign  direct
investment and so forth.

So, from that point of view, this is a welcome Bill. It is  something  that,
certainly, takes us a long way towards getting the IDC to  do  the  kind  of
things that we want it to do.

I just wanted to indicate that the IDC is probably the fourth largest  state
corporation in the country at the moment. It controls  about  R17,4  billion
worth of assets, and it is the fifth largest income- generating  corporation
in the country. The IDC is earning about R630  million  per  annum  for  the
country.

Already the IDC is  involved  in  a  number  of  SADC  countries.  They  are
involved in nine different countries in the  SADC  region.  With  this  Bill
they would be able to go beyond the SADC countries,  all  the  way  up  into
Africa.  They  are  already  involved  in  aluminium,  mining,  agriculture,
manufacturing and tourism.  With this Bill, hopefully, they will be able  to
go down the line into smaller sectors in the economy  and  get  involved  in
those areas. Of course, the Bill now also empowers the IDC to move into  the
ICT sector.

Another little interesting statistic is that in the year 2000, for  example,
the IDC was responsible for creating some  17  500  jobs  in  this  country,
which is a  phenomenal  number  of  jobs  from  one  particular  company  or
organisation. Last year, 2000, some of their investment activities led to  a
R4 billion growth in exports, in our country.

However, there are a  number  of  problems  with  this  Bill  of  which  the
Minister is probably well aware. One, which he  has  already  mentioned,  is
the fact that the Bill is really outdated. We know  that  the  Ministry  has
started the process of reviewing this Bill and that  the  Minister  has  the
intention of introducing a new IDC  Bill  into  Parliament,  hopefully  next
year. As Parliament, we are saying that we will really support him on  that.
We know that we need to modernise the legislation and the IDC  in  order  to
participate at an international level. We think that this  is  long  overdue
and we would certainly be supporting him on that.

Another area of the IDC that needs  discussion  by  Parliament  and  policy-
makers is: What is the balance between pure  business  principles  that  the
IDC involves itself in on the one hand and  the  developmental  activity  it
ought to involve itself in on the other hand? Sometimes,  involving  oneself
in developmental  projects  does  not  necessarily  generate  profits.  They
generate profits in a  different  way.  They  might  generate  socioeconomic
profits which are not calculable in financial terms or  in  terms  of  money
which is rands and cents.

We need to start talking about how we see the role of the IDC as on the  one
hand operating on pure business principles  because  we  want  it  to  be  a
strong company that generates its own finance and  sustainability.  But,  on
the other hand, its primary objective was to develop certain sectors of  the
economy.

How do we engage in that balance?  That  discourse  needs  to  start  taking
place more extensively at parliamentary level and at the  level  of  policy,
just to understand where we are going. For example, does  the  IDC  have  to
hold on to some of the very large assets that it has at the moment?  It  has
huge assets such as, for example, the Sasol assets,  and  a  number  of  big
corporations and companies  where  it  has  equity  share  holdings.  Do  we
continue holding those share holdings or  do  we  sell  those  and  generate
cash, so that we can use that cash to  move  into  certain  sectors  of  the
economy where we need to spend that money in order to further stimulate  the
economy and generate growth?

Those are the kinds of debates that one would like to see starting  to  take
place more and more. We note - something which is very  encouraging  -  that
the IDC has been spending more and more money over the  past  few  years  on
black economic empowerment. In fact, between the year  1996  and  2001,  the
IDC's spending on black economic empowerment increased  by  close  to  about
30%. That is very encouraging, and we hope  that  it  continues.  Hopefully,
with this Bill, since the IDC will move into previously disadvantaged  areas
and SMMEs, it may be able to achieve that objective in a much greater way.

Finally, one just needs to say that the IDC is a fantastic resource  in  our
country, because, firstly, it has developed a  tremendous  amount  of  skill
over the years, and, secondly, it has  financial,  business  and  leveraging
resources in our country. The  provincial  economic  development  programmes
must take note of the  IDC.  I  do  not  know  how  many  of  the  provinces
represented here today who have economic  development  programmes  in  their
provinces have been speaking on a day-to-day basis with the IDC  about  what
their economic development programmes are. If they have not been  doing  it,
they must start doing so urgently.

The IDC has got skills, and it has indicated that it wants to  engage  in  a
strong relationship with provincial  economic  development  programmes.  For
example, in Gauteng we have indicated together that we  would  like  to  see
Geda - the Gauteng Economic Development Agency - starting to work much  more
closely with the IDC, even with regard to the Blue IQ, the Gautrain  project
and so forth.

There is no reason the IDC should not became a stakeholder and part of  many
of those processes. We know that they have  been  talking  to  the  IDC.  We
encourage provinces to continue doing that and we hope that  they  will,  so
that our working together with the IDC at provincial level  and  perhaps  at
local government level as well should lead to  greater  achievement  of  the
objectives of the IDC, and therefore of Government as a whole.
With those few words, I would like to say that  we  are  excited  about  the
possibilities for the IDC. We think that this is the right way to go. We  in
the ANC certainly support this Bill and call on the whole House  to  support
it. In fact, next year  we  want  to  engage  the  House  again  on  further
modernising the IDC. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  members,
just before I proceed allow me to recognise and welcome  a  delegation  from
the Republic of Kazakhstan who are in the gallery. They are members  of  the
lower house. You are welcome. [Applause.]

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, we would like to congratulate  the  Minister  on
this Bill. We really think that it is very necessary at this time  in  South
Africa.  We  need  greater  economic  growth  and  more  job  creation,  and
therefore we like this Bill very much.

The IDC is a self-financing  state-owned  development  finance  institution,
whose primary objectives are to contribute to  the  generation  of  balanced
sustainable economic growth in South Africa  and  to  further  the  economic
prosperity of all citizens.

The Industrial Development Amendment Bill seeks two  major  changes  to  the
IDC: firstly, to  extend  the  activities  of  the  corporation  beyond  the
borders of the Republic for the  benefit  of  the  Southern  African  region
specifically and the rest of Africa generally, and, secondly, to foster  the
development of small  and  medium  enterprises  and  co-operatives,  thereby
promoting   the   economic   empowerment   of   historically   disadvantaged
communities and persons.

I first want to deal with the extension of the IDC's activities  beyond  the
borders of the RSA. I am  sure  we  all  agree  that  economic  growth,  job
creation  and  economic  integration  are  of  critical  importance  to  the
Southern African  Development  Community,  or  SADC.  Because  of  the  good
international  standing  of  the  IDC,  it  will  be  possible  to   channel
international investment  to  sound  business  opportunities  in  the  whole
region.

Economic integration in the SADC region will create bigger markets and  more
jobs and enhance the economic viability  of  the  whole  region.  Many  more
natural resource endowments and competitive advantages can  be  explored  to
the benefit of the region as a whole. Furthermore, it will be  conducive  to
efficiency gains, promote the transfer  of  technology  and  skills,  assist
regional players in attaining economies of scale and,  among  other  things,
improve access to information. Regional  integration  and  development  will
also enhance the visibility of individual countries  as  potential  markets,
as suppliers of goods and services and as global investment destinations.

It appears that the IDC has already progressively expanded  its  involvement
in the SADC region as a catalyst for investment in productive  capacity.  If
the  IDC  further  uses  its  accumulated  technical   know-how   and   good
international reputation to enhance the  whole  SADC  region  with  economic
growth and development, it can only be commended on doing so.

Now I want to turn  to  small  and  medium  enterprises.  The  second  major
amendment to the Industrial Development Act endeavours to extend  the  scope
of the activities of the IDC in line with the trade  and  industrial  policy
of the  Government  to  stimulate  small  and  medium  enterprises,  thereby
promoting entrepreneurship. It is also proposed that the IDC  be  explicitly
enabled to promote the economic empowerment  of  historically  disadvantaged
communities and persons. In this regard I can quote from the Bill:


  ... to foster the development of small and  medium  enterprises  and  co-
  operatives ...

And -


  ... to promote the economic empowerment of the historically disadvantaged
  communities and persons ...

These are very sound and  necessary  objectives  for  South  Africa  at  the
moment and definitely goals that  the  IDC  should  pursue  in  the  current
economic situation in South Africa.

One factor that will definitely also play a role is whether the IDC will  be
able to develop user-friendly services that can make a really big impact  in
this new market. New entrepreneurs are  definitely  not  always  capable  of
developing extensive  business  plans  and  doing  financial  planning  that
impresses everybody. The IDC  will  therefore  have  an  extensive  task  in
assisting new entrepreneurs in this regard, and these skills will also  have
to be developed and acquired.

But we all know that South Africa needs new entrepreneurs and new small  and
medium enterprises. We also know the necessity  of  promoting  the  economic
empowerment  of  historically  disadvantaged  communities  and  persons.  We
therefore would like to wish the IDC well in their new endeavours  and  hope
that the IDC will be able to stimulate the South African economy  to  higher
growth levels and create lots of new, sustainable job opportunities.

As for the influence on Gauteng, the  IDC's  new  venture  into  stimulating
small and medium enterprises intends to allow  the  corporation  to  promote
smaller  downstream  and  subsidiary  economic  undertakings.  Benefits  for
Gauteng would include the complementarity  that  the  IDC  would  bring  for
agencies such as the Gauteng  Economic  Development  Agency,  or  Geda,  and
possible contributions to some of the major projects that are  part  of  the
strategic economic ... [Time expired.]

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chaiperson, hon  members,  Minister,  distinguished  guests,
the Industrial Development Corporation operates under an  Act  that  is,  of
course, relatively old. It was passed in 1940, when Jan Smuts was still  the
Prime Minister of South  Africa.  Certain  of  its  provisions  have  become
obsolete in our new democracy, hence the amendments which seek to  modernise
this Act.

Because it is also a wholly owned state corporation, it has a critical  role
to play in terms of commercially sustainable industrial development  to  the
benefit not only of South Africa, but also of the Southern  African  region.
In this respect, it would most certainly  augment  the  objectives  of  Map,
which,  after  broad  consultation  with  leaders  of  the  continent,   was
incorporated into the New Partnership for Africa's Development.

Furthermore, this Bill has earned the unqualified  support  and  respect  of
our alliance partner, Cosatu. I think  that  it  is  also  proper  to  quote
Cosatu's proposed amendments from its submission:


  Make employment creation an explicit objective of  IDC;  provide  support
  for  SMMEs  and  co-operatives;  make  provision  for  the  extension  of
  differential interest rates; develop a developmental focus and not only a
  narrow business  orientation;  broader  developmental  criteria  for  the
  selection of IDC investments; IDC investment projects  must  comply  with
  labour legislation.

The committee supported the Bill but proposed a  more  comprehensive  review
of industrial policy, and the IDC hearings were proposed for next year.

Please, allow me to apply my mind to provincial gains  and  implications  of
this Bill. Due to  retrenchments  that  took  place  in  the  South  African
economy, as from the 1980s, unemployed persons returned to their  places  of
origin, that is, provinces. On the other  hand,  industrial  activities  are
almost nonexistent in some provinces of the country.

The Bill extends the activities of the  IDC  in  line  with  the  trade  and
industrial policies of Government, with special emphasis  on  the  promotion
of small and medium entrepreneurial activities.  The  Government's  strategy
of encouraging  small  businesses  as  engines  for  economic  growth  will,
therefore, be enhanced by this proposed legislation.

The  amendments   support   the   economic   empowerment   of   historically
disadvantaged communities and persons. This will  be  beneficial  for  those
provinces that are economically backward. A lack of  entrepreneurial  skills
has been viewed by most researchers as one of  the  obstacles  to  unskilled
emerging entrepreneurs in the country's poorest  provinces.  Therefore,  the
support of  economic  empowerment  for  provincial  communities  would  mean
training and access to finance. This would go a long  way  towards  ensuring
economic activities  which  will  translate  into  job  creation,  with  the
ultimate result  being  the  eradication  of  deep-rooted  poverty  in  some
provinces.

According to the Human Sciences Research Council's 1999 study,  41%  of  the
South African population felt that the creation of employment should be  the
Government's top priority.  The  legislation  will  address  some  of  these
perspectives by ensuring an enabling environment  for  employment  creation.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, this morning in the  programming  committee
we had a  short  discussion  on  a  specific  word  that  was  developed  in
Parliament, namely ``covered''. I feel like saying that I am ``covered''  by
what the other members have said, but I want to elaborate a little.

The new Government really inherited a lot of  problems  in  1994,  but  they
also inherited organisations like the IDC that have a record of success  and
we must build on that.

In  artikel  1  van  dié  wetsontwerp  word   gepoog   om   die   Nywerheid-
ontwikkelingskorporasie  se  veld  van   bedrywighede   uit   te   brei   in
ooreenstemming  met  die  regering  se  handel-  en   nywerheidsbeleid   met
spesifieke   verwysing   na   die    bevordering    van    die    Nywerheid-
ontwikkelingskorporasie  se  aktiwiteit  op  die  gebied   van   klein-   en
middelgrootte ondernemings.

Dit is dié gebied waarop ek meen die agb minister ook voel ons  tot  in  dié
stadium beter moes presteer het. Dit  is  die  een  afdeling  wat  ons  land
regtig sal bemagtig en armoede uit die weg kan ruim.

Ek is baie dankbaar dat dit nou ook, by wyse van  die  wysigingswetsontwerp,
voorrang by die Nywerheid-ontwikkelingskorporasie geniet om  daaraan  aandag
te skenk. Ons hoop die projek sal spoedig momentum kry.
Die gedagte  is  om  die  NOK  uitdruklik  te  bemagtig  om  die  ekonomiese
bemagtiging van histories benadeelde gemeenskappe en  persone  te  bevorder,
entrepreneurskap  by  klein-  en  mediumondernemings  te   kweek,   in   die
werkverskaffingsbedrywighede in onderontwikkelde gebiede te belê en  om  die
skep van kennisgegronde nywerhede en nuwe  tegnologie-gegronde  ondernemings
aan te moedig.

Die Nywerheid-ontwikkelingskorporasie se  beleid  is  gegrond  op  die  vrye
mark, met ander woorde op volhoubaarheid. Omdat  dit  op  volhoubaarheid  en
nie net op die registrasie van projekte gegrond is nie, behoort  die  sukses
baie groot te wees. Voorheen was daar  ongelukkig  talle  entrepreneurs  ten
opsigte van projek-ontwikkeling, maar nie baie wat  projekte  kon  begin  en
volhou nie.

Afdeling  2  van  die  wysigingswetsontwerp   maak   voorsiening   vir   die
uitbreiding van die geografiese gebiede waar die NOK bedrywig  mag  wees  en
nywerheidsprojekte kan  befonds.  Dié  wysigingswetsontwerp,  omdat  dit  op
gesonde vryemarkbeginsels gegrond is, het dus  geen  finansiële  implikasies
vir die staat nie.

Ek hoop ek het die agb Moosa verkeerd verstaan toe  hy  verwys  het  na  die
kapitale bates van  die  Nywerheid-ontwikkelingskorporasie  wat  miskien  in
geld omgeskep moet word. Ons moet net versigtig wees dat ons  nie  die  gans
wat die goue eiers lê, se nek omdraai nie. Na my mening stel  baie  van  dié
bates die Nywerheid-ontwikkelingskorporasie juis in staat om ander mense  te
bemagtig, geld te bekom en ook sukses in die handel en nywerheid te behaal.

Die Nuwe NP steun die  wetsontwerp.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows)

[In section 1 of this Bill an  attempt  is  made  to  extend  the  field  of
activity of the Industrial Development Corporation in  accordance  with  the
Government's trade and industrial policy, with  specific  reference  to  the
promotion of the activities of the  Industrial  Development  Corporation  in
the sphere of small and medium enterprises.
I think that it is in this area that the hon the Minister  also  feels  that
we should have performed better up until now. This is the one  sector  which
will really empower our country and be able to eradicate poverty.

I am very grateful that now, by way of the amending Bill, this will  receive
priority  in   receiving   attention   from   the   Industrial   Development
Corporation. We hope that the project will gain momentum quickly.

The  idea  is  to  expressly  empower  the  IDC  to  promote  the   economic
empowerment  of  historically  disadvantaged  communities  and  persons,  to
nurture entrepreneurship in small and medium enterprises, to invest  in  the
job creation  activities  in  underdeveloped  areas  and  to  encourage  the
creation   of   knowledge-based   industries   and   new    technology-based
enterprises.

The Industrial  Development  Corporation's  policy  is  based  on  the  free
market,  in  other  words  on  sustainability.  Because  it  is   based   on
sustainability and not on the registration of projects, the  success  should
be great. Unfortunately, in the past there were numerous entrepreneurs  with
regard to project development, but not many who could initiate  and  sustain
projects.

Section 2 of the amending Bill makes provision  for  the  expansion  of  the
geographic areas in which the IDC may be  active  and  can  fund  industrial
projects.  Because  it  is  based  on  sound  free-market  principles,  this
amending Bill therefore has no financial implications for the state.

I hope I misunderstood the hon Moosa when he referred to the capital  assets
of the Industrial Development Corporation which should perhaps be  converted
into money. We must just be careful that we do  not  kill  the  goose  which
lays the golden eggs. In  my  opinion,  many  of  these  assets  enable  the
Industrial Development Corporation to empower other people, to obtain  money
and also to achieve success in trade and industry.

The New NP supports the Bill. [Applause.]]

Mr P NGCOBO (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, the provincial standing  committee
on the NCOP mandated us to  support  this  Bill  as  tabled  in  the  select
committee on economic and foreign affairs, or any other further amendments.

Given the fact that the Government  is  committed  to  stimulating  projects
that will create jobs, this Bill came at the right time, because tourism  is
one of the most important industries that is poised to create the jobs  that
we need in our country.

The question of franchising is another area that needs our attention.  These
companies always ask exorbitant amounts and one finds that the  entrepreneur
gets almost nothing because the larger chunk of  the  returns  goes  towards
the main company.

Previously disadvantaged individuals are hardly ever found  in  these  areas
because of the price  structure.  Whether  we  are  talking  about  a  motor
dealership, fast food restaurants or service stations, all of them  are  out
of reach for our people.

We are hopeful that the IDC will in future be sympathetic to our  people  if
we are to bring them into the fold.

The question of corporate governance cannot be overemphasised.  However,  we
are mindful of the fact that the  private  sector  is  always  reluctant  to
implement the first King report. The second King report is already out,  but
people are very concerned about the recommendations in this  report.  People
are saying it is onerous to the companies.

Lastly, we support this Bill because it is one of the  economic  tools  that
will be used by our  private  and  public  sector  to  do  business  in  our
Southern African region and the rest of Africa. The experience  we  have  in
South Africa can assist our brothers  in  Africa,  which  is  preferable  to
depending on European countries that come to Africa just to  maximise  their
profits without ploughing something back into the region.  Africa  needs  to
stand on its own if it is to realise the African Renaissance.

All Bills that are meant to repeal Acts that were passed before I  was  born
are always commended. This is because transformation is an ongoing  process.


Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson and Minister,  the  IDC  deservedly  has  a  good
reputation nationally and abroad. It has earned this  reputation  over  long
years. This causes it to raise funds at competitive rates. Now we allow  for
the debt  equity  ratio,  raising  it  to  100%  from  the  current  75%.  I
understand that in real terms it is currently around 40%.

In a world where focus and sticking to one's  knitting  is  the  thing,  and
where debt and risk control are paramount, particularly when  one  works  in
hostile or difficult environments, we see the IDC increasing  its  potential
risk profile by diversifying and possibly losing focus.

Not only can the debt profile rise, but the IDC has been set up to  work  in
a poor neighbourhood with all its problems. I am concerned  that  there  may
just be too many variables at once. It has a good track record and  is  good
at  bringing  big  locomotive  projects  to   fruition,   having   done   so
successfully for many years. But I feel that we should  be  careful  not  to
spread  the  IDC  too  thin,  possibly   weakening   its   creditworthiness,
increasing its risks and reducing its focus.

On the positive side, the IDC has a great role to play. I  hope  that  there
are prioritised projects in South and Southern  Africa  before  it  ventures
too far afield. It has a good, but not unlimited, capacity. We look  forward
to working with the IDC in the Western Cape.

The IDC cannot be all things to all men.  It  is  good  at  large  projects,
locomotive projects with many downstream spinoff benefits.  I  believe  that
with medium-sized businesses it might do something good  and  already  does.
But I believe that the focus for small business should be elsewhere.  It  is
certainly essential to do those things, but is this the place to do them?  I
am not sure.

The management skills for that kind of control are quite different  to  what
one requires for running huge projects. Of course  these  things  should  be
done, but is the IDC  the  vehicle?  I  know  that  the  Minister  has  good
judgment. I seldom disagree with the things that the  Minister  does.  I  am
simply  asking  the  Minister  to  consider  these  issues.  In   fact,   we
enthusiastically support the IDC, the department and the Bill.

Mr R Z NOGUMLA: Chairperson, I feel honoured to be able to  speak  today  on
this Bill. This Bill gives meaning to our vision as the ANC of  what  should
happen to the continent in the area of economic development.

We believe as the Eastern Cape that one of the critical objectives  of  this
Bill is to extend the mandate of the IDC so as to enable it  to  operate  in
the Southern African Development Community without restrictions.
At present, it has 30 projects in operation in nine SADC countries.  In  the
past, the IDC had to obtain permission from Cabinet on a case-by-case  basis
to do this. This aspect of the Bill has  received  broad  support  and  will
increase initiatives aimed at special development  and  economic  activities
amongst members of SADC.

Of particular significance is the amendment to section 3  of  the  principal
Act. This section seeks to promote and finance new sectors of  the  economy,
in  particular  the  knowledge  economy,  ancillary  and  related  areas  of
tourism,  agro-industries   and   information   technology.   Moreover,   it
endeavours to  promote  economic  empowerment  of  previously  disadvantaged
communities, and the development  of  co-operatives  and  small  and  medium
enterprises, which are crucial and central blocks of  Government's  economic
development strategy.

This is  important  because  it  provides  an  essential  means  of  poverty
alleviation. Of course, poverty will not be eradicated  only  through  small
and medium business development. To eliminate poverty, the country  needs  a
high level of growth to redistribute income, but until South Africa  arrives
at that point, small businesses provide a means for people  to  improve  the
situation of their families and communities.

Secondly, small business is one of the paths  to  black  empowerment.  Other
paths include the training of black  professionals  and  managers,  and  the
establishment of substantial black-owned companies. However, for many  black
people who were deprived of opportunities in the past, entrepreneurship  and
small business development  is  an  important  option.  Thirdly,  small  and
medium enterprises increase competition  in  the  economy.  This,  in  turn,
leads to lower prices and more competitive prices. So  they  improve  living
standards and create wealth.

Although the number of amendments to the Bill is, in fact, limited, they  do
however  address  important  aspects.  Some  of  these  aspects  are  purely
technical in nature, namely compliance with the  Public  Finance  Management
Act, for example when raising loans or borrowing money, and in the event  of
the issue of debentures. The Bill goes further to add provisions that  cater
for  the  implementation  of  procurement  and  outsourcing   policies   and
programmes that would enhance economic empowerment.

The Bill also brings the Industrial Development  Corporation  in  line  with
the sensitivities related to gender issues, with  the  substitution  of  the
single reference to gender, namely ``he''.

Overall,  the  department  accedes  that  more  changes,  other  than  those
accommodated in the scope of the amendments before us,  should  be  deferred
in  order  to  allow  for  harmonisation  of  the   Industrial   Development
Corporation and the Act.

We do, nevertheless, have positive indications from both the  Department  of
Trade and Industry and the Ministry that, given the outdated nature of  this
Act, the process is already under way. [Applause.]

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, hon Minister,  colleagues,  national  Government
has  developed  a  macroeconomic  policy  geared  towards   rebuilding   and
restructuring the economy of the country. One of  the  basic  principles  of
the policy is the linking of reconstruction and  development,  which  should
be an integrated process. This is where the public sector must play a  major
role, since it cannot  be  expected  that  the  market  would  make  such  a
structural transformation on its own.

The  principles  of  this  macroeconomic  policy  recognise   the   mutually
reinforcing nature of urban and  rural  development,  integrated  to  ensure
that the needs of all our  people  are  met  in  a  balanced  and  equitable
manner. Taking these broad guidelines into consideration, the  province  has
developed its own industrial development policy guidelines within  which  we
are operating.

These guidelines  are  the  optional  promotion  of  productive  investment,
beneficiation  and  export  trade  to  achieve  economic   growth,   through
stimulating  the  development  of  the  respective  sectors   according   to
competitive  advantages  and  long-term  sustainability;  facilitating  such
economic growth with a  view  to  stimulating  entrepreneurial  and  income-
generating opportunities and the resultant socioeconomic upliftment  of  the
people; ensuring that the benefits of  economic  growth  reach  the  broader
community; facilitating a  productive  working  relationship  among  labour,
business and Government in managing the economy; the optimal development  of
the SMME sector, with a view to the integration  of  emerging  entrepreneurs
into the mainstream economy; facilitating the optimal  transfer  of  science
and technology; the optimal development  and  promotion  of  the  province's
tourism  sector  as  a  potential  source  of  entrepreneurial  growth   and
employment opportunity;  and  ensuring  sustainable  industrial  development
through high environmental standards.

We believe that by implementing these policy guidelines we  should  be  able
to achieve the following objectives:  a  substantial  increase  in  the  net
national investment, especially in manufacturing, job creation  and  meeting
basic needs, as well as the enhancement of technological capacity to  ensure
that, as part of the restructuring of industry, South Africa  emerges  as  a
significant exporter of manufactured goods.

Industrial expansion should follow from the extension of  infrastructure  to
urban, peri-urban  and  rural  areas,  while  trade  policy  must  introduce
instruments  to  promote  the  export  of  manufactured  goods  in  general.
Industrial  policy  must  support  and  strengthen   those   internationally
competitive industries. The strategy must strengthen  and  broaden  upstream
and downstream linkages between the burgeoning mineral-based industries  and
other subsectors of industry.

All of this looks good on paper, but to  practically  implement  it  is  not
that simple. The one problem that we have in our province is the lack  of  a
medium-sized industrial base. We do  have  large  industries  which  do  not
really need financial assistance. Then we have macro  and  small  industries
which are mainly assisted by NGOs or donor funders.  The  problem,  however,
is the lack of finance for the medium-sized enterprises. We believe that  we
should target medium-sized industry for  development  and  grow  it  into  a
competitive global player.

We all know that the commercial banks in South Africa are very reluctant  to
get involved in this sector due to the so-called risk factor.  In  the  past
the IDC were also only involved in megaprojects and were not geared for  the
smaller projects. Usually these megaprojects were also not  labour-intensive
and the ratio of capital to jobs was totally skewed.

We are glad to note that the IDC  are  now  realigning  themselves  to  also
promote  the  economic  empowerment  of   the   historically   disadvantaged
communities so as to foster the development of small and medium  enterprises
and   to   promote   employment-creating    activities    particularly    in
underdeveloped  areas.  This  will   assist   in   developing   medium-sized
businesses and prepare them to be acceptable for the numerous joint  venture
proposals that we receive from foreign investors.

The other area is our linkage programme into foreign countries. A number  of
our small and medium  enterprises  are  doing  business  with  multinational
companies in neighbouring countries, for example Mozal in Mozambique. A  lot
of work in Mozal has been outsourced to either South  African  companies  or
joint ventures between Mozambican and South African companies.  One  of  the
main obstacles here has also been the lack of financing.

It therefore brings joy to see that  the  IDC  is  now  also  spreading  its
activities to the Southern African region and the rest of Africa. This  will
assist the industrial development  in  this  region  tremendously  and  will
definitely contribute to the success of the linkage  programme  between  our
neighbouring countries.

[It is a great pleasure for us to note that the IDC  is  now  spreading  its
work throughout the region of Southern Africa. That will help a  great  deal
in the industrial development of this region. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Mr J P GELDERBLOM (Western Cape): Chairperson,  the  Industrial  Development
Amendment Bill and Industrial Development Act are an important step  in  the
future economic development of the country. In essence, they pertain to  the
changing priorities regarding  the  Industrial  Development  Corporation  in
line with Government economic priorities. The main amendments relate to  the
following area: promotion of the historically disadvantaged. If  this  large
part of our community is left out in the cold  there  can  be  no  long-term
prosperity in our country.

I am convinced that there is an abundance of  untapped  entrepreneurship  in
this community. The development of  small  and  medium  enterprises  is  the
place to start growing our economy. It  is  out  of  such  enterprises  that
success stories are born. No major corporation started off  as  major.  They
all grew from humble beginnings.

To encourage the creation of  new  knowledge-based  industries,  we  in  the
Western Cape have already started this process and our White  Paper  on  the
knowledge economy has been published for comment. We hope  to  pass  a  Bill
through  the  provincial  parliament  in  the  near  future   to   implement
procurement and outsourcing policies and programmes.

It is also pleasing  that  the  amendment  calls  for  the  mandate  of  the
Industrial Development Corporation to be extended  to  the  entire  Southern
African region. We,  in  the  Western  Cape,  are  committed  to  playing  a
responsible role in the improvement of  the  lives  of  all  the  people  in
Southern Africa. We cannot sleep  peacefully  if  our  neighbours  are  left
behind in the economic development stakes. The  Western  Cape  supports  the
Industrial Development Amendment Bill and the Industrial Development Act.

Mr S L E FENYANE: Chairperson, allow me to state at  the  outset  that  this
Chamber passed the Constitutive Act of the African Union. The objectives  of
that Act were, inter alia, to achieve greater unity and  solidarity  between
African countries and the peoples of Africa,  to  accelerate  the  political
and socioeconomic integration of the continent in order that Africa be  well
positioned  to  face,  in  an  organised  way,  the  challenges   posed   by
globalisation.

In sync with the letter of the above objectives,  the  Department  of  Trade
and  Industry  has  introduced  in  Parliament  the  Industrial  Development
Amendment Bill. The objects of this Bill state without any  equivoque,  that
the amendment will extend the  activities  of  the  corporation  beyond  the
borders of South Africa for the  benefit  of  the  Southern  African  region
specifically and the rest of Africa generally.

This is a timely intervention by  the  South  African  Government  precisely
because countries bargain successfully in multilateral institutions if,  and
only if, they submit their resolutions as collectives and trade blocs.

We have spoken at length  about  the  African  Renaissance.  It  is,  in  my
opinion, about time that we begin to move away from  policy  formulation  to
practical implementation of theory. We have to make Africa,  our  continent,
attractive to us first, then we will be able to sell it to the rest  of  the
world. We must try everything in our power to socialise African  communities
to derive more value from what  they  already  own,  and  to  utilise  their
assets in a manner that is sustainable and in  a  manner  that  secures  our
survival and livelihood over time.

For far too long Africa has existed  to  help  other  countries  to  prosper
economically - at it own expense. We  should  not,  in  reference  to  other
countries, evince the spirit of the words of John Ball, ``the mad priest  of
Kent'', who wrote:


  Good people, things will never go well in England so long as goods be not
  in common, and so long as there be villains and gentlemen. By what  right
  are they whom we call lords greater folk than we? On  what  grounds  have
  they deserved it? Why do they hold us in serfage? If we all come  of  the
  same father and mother, of Adam and Eve, how can they say or  prove  that
  they are better than we, if it be not that they make us gain for them  by
  our toil what they spend in their pride? They are clothed in  velvet  and
  warm in their furs and their ermines, while we  are  covered  with  rags.
  They have wine and spices and fair bread; and we oat-cake and straw,  and
  water to drink. They have leisure and  fine  houses;  we  have  pain  and
  labour, the rain and wind in the fields. And yet it is of us and our toil
  that these men hold their state.

Africa deserves better, and the  usefulness  of  South  Africa's  aid  as  a
partner, a participant and not a pariah cannot be overemphasised. This  Bill
is an instrument for South Africa to play a pivotal  role  in  the  economic
revival of Southern  Africa  and  the  rest  of  Africa.  I  would  like  to
emphasise that what the department is proposing in this Bill is not  without
precedent. The United States of America spearheaded the formation  of  Nafta
amid fierce political opposition and resistance.  The  World  Bank,  through
its IRDP, helped resuscitate the  economies  of  Japan  and  other  European
countries after World War II. Japan itself helped in  the  resuscitation  of
the economies of the South East Asian countries. That is why today  we  have
cars in South Africa that come from South Korea.  That  is  because  of  the
help of Japan.

The European Union itself would not have been where it is today if  Germany,
Britain and France had not been prepared to sacrifice economically  for  the
benefit of other poorer member states. The challenge that is  facing  us  is
to pass this Bill forthwith, roll up our sleeves and get down to work.

We definitely cannot, as Gunter  Pauli  has  argued,  expect  the  earth  to
produce more. We need to act prudently and do  more  with  what  Africa,  in
this context, produces naturally. Then and only  then  can  others  take  us
seriously. If we do not do that, Africa will forever be known as a  sleeping
giant which has enormous potential. We do not deserve this label,  which  is
as moribund as it is necrophilic. We deserve better. The ANC  supports  this
Bill and we would like to urge others to follow suit. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, I thank the members of  the
House for their comments, and support for the amendments.

Members raised a number of issues, and I would just like to comment on  some
of them. Firstly, I would like to say a  little  bit  more  about  precisely
what the IDC does, because this  has  been  a  question  that  a  number  of
members have raised in one or other way.

I think the starting point we should  all  have  in  mind  is  that  without
Government itself having to raise taxes or borrow money,  we  have,  in  the
Industrial Development Corporation, a major  instrument  to  carry  out  and
support investments, and go into partnerships with international  investors.
This is a very crucial exercise. As I indicated in my  opening  remarks,  we
are looking at close to 10%, in any one year 6% or 7% of investment.

The IDC can only do that if it operates in an effective way. So it would  be
a pointless exercise for us as a country to place  obligations  on  the  IDC
that would make it more difficult to raise money in the  capital  market  or
would make it a partner in  which  people  did  not  have  confidence.  This
question of confidence is very well illustrated in the  Mozal  project  that
the hon Themba talked about.

We should bear in mind that no  other  international  financing  agency  was
prepared to finance a project in Mozambique  because  of  the  overall  risk
profile  of  Mozambique.  But  major  international  corporations  such   as
Mitsubishi in Japan and other European financing agencies were  prepared  to
come in if the IDC came in. Now this indicates the  confidence  that  people
have in the IDC. I think we  need  to  be  very  clear.  As  Government  our
mandate to the IDC is very clear,  that  one  must  operate  effectively  in
areas that will develop the economy.
If we want other developmental matters to be dealt with, we do  two  things.
Firstly, we have allowed the IDC to set aside certain  funds  that  it  has,
instead of paying them to us as a dividend, which it  uses  on  a  grant  or
support  basis.  So  in  certain  circumstances,  in  order  to  develop   a
particular area or project, it will have those kinds of funds.  In  addition
to those funds, it has support from the European Union for similar types  of
projects. But generally speaking, overwhelmingly the IDC  is  not  a  grant-
making body - it is an equity body or a lending institution.

The second thing that we  have  done,  which  members  may  have  picked  up
recently in the media, is to begin to encourage the IDC to work  with  other
financing agencies of the state. We have an MOU, and we  are  starting  with
the first pilot project in the Lebombo SDI. This is an MOU between the  IDC,
DBSA, Khula and the Department of Trade and Industry  in  the  form  of  the
enterprise organisation. In this way we can bring together  different  types
of financing, with each  of  these  organisations  specialising  -  the  hon
member Durr is correct - in where they are the most effective.

The IDC is a very good project-financing organisation.  It  finances  either
with equity or with loans. So by bringing them together we get the  best  of
all worlds. I think we need to bear this in mind  when  we  discuss  issues.
The other thing that I would  like  to  stress  is  that  one  of  the  most
important parts of the IDC is that it is run by  an  excellent  board  on  a
mandate from the Ministry,  and  we  do  not  interfere  in  these  specific
projects. We work on a very clear basis, and that is that if the  investment
is large, then the IDC approaches me as the  shareholding  Ministry  to  ask
what my views are on the matter.  The same applies to  the  private  sector.
Any company with a subsidiary would expect that subsidiary to  consult  them
on a major new initiative or investment. If it is  a  change  in  policy  or
they feel that it may not be in the mandate, they consult  the  shareholder.
This is important because it allows the IDC scope to have some  flexibility.
I do not give them instructions about their holdings on  shares,  unless  it
is a big change.

In response to the question the hon Moosa raised as to whether  they  should
hold their mature assets or not, we should not lock them  too  much  into  a
straitjacket. These can be very important sources of finance. They are  also
a stability in the portfolio and an income earner. We therefore do not  want
to lock them too tightly into that - that is something we leave  largely  to
the discretion of the board.

The provincial developments programmes, which a number of members,  such  as
the hon member Ngcobo, hon Themba and hon Moosa  have  mentioned,  are  very
intersting programmes that are  developing.  What  we  have  done  with  the
provincial governments is to go through each provincial plan with them,  and
we will be reporting nationally on all of  these  plans.  Hon  members  will
find that the IDC has played an active role in many of these plans,  and  we
are facilitating further action that will be taken. A week and  a  half  ago
we met with the mayors of the six metros  and  looked  at  their  plans  and
programmes, because these are very interesting and  exciting  programmes  in
which the IDC can play a role too.

Members mentioned tourism, and I think this is interesting. The IDC was  not
involved in tourism before, but we expanded its mandate, and  I  think  that
members will find in most provinces some  very  interesting  projects  which
they are involved in. There is one project, which is a series  of  projects,
which basically looks at the whole coast of South Africa  and  sees  how  we
can improve the tourist infrastructure of our  entire  coast.  What  members
will see over the next year or year and a half is a series of  announcements
of port developments, which means that the IDC will invest in new ports.

We will build small  ports  that  could  be  used  mainly  for  tourism  and
recreation, but  also  can  open  up  certain  economic  possibilities.  For
example, the project in Port St Johns would be an upgrading and  development
of the port.  There  is  a  project  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  Princeton  in  Port
Shepstone. It is also an upgrading and development of the port.

Those who know their economic history will know that both  of  those  places
had small ports and once upon a time they were trading  ports  as  well.  We
are going to open this up for recreation and trade. It is  an  exciting  set
of possibilities which shows how we can expand  the  tourism  infrastructure
just on that coastline. There are a number of other  projects  too  that  we
are working on, but I think that this is an exciting  set  of  possibilities
that we can deal with.

Let me make two quick points on the scope that the hon  member  Durr  raised
on SMMEs. It is correct. The IDC works on a mandate. It has business  units,
it cannot just go and do anything at once. So it has to find business  units
that we monitor and it reports on. He is correct  that  we  cannot  just  do
everything. It cannot be everything to everyone. That is not going to  work.
It is a focused and well-managed investment project financing bank.

We have to bear in mind that the IDC does  not  deal  with  the  very  small
enterprises. It basically deals with small  and  medium  enterprises.  Those
who are familiar with the Small  Business  Development  Act  will  know  the
different sectors will define different sizes as small or  medium,  and  the
IDC mainly focuses on what would be fairly large small companies, if  I  can
put it that way, and medium companies. It does not deal with micro  or  very
small companies. We do not want to get into that area, for the  very  reason
that we have indicated. This  is  not  the  expertise.  It  is  a  different
financing operation altogether.

The IDC finances through equity or loans for specific enterprises  where  it
can assess what is happening over time. It is not a general financier.  That
is a different operation. That is banking. The IDC is not a bank,  it  is  a
project financier. This is an important point we would like to make.

I would like to very quickly comment on the last two points.  I  am  pleased
that we have introduced co-operatives into the amendment. This is  something
that we do not utilise sufficiently in South Africa across the  wide  front.
Members will recall that in South Africa agricultural co-ops  have  existed,
but not very much else.

In the Department of Trade and Industry we do have a  project  now.  We  are
working with a number of organisations  to  see  if  we  cannot  expand  co-
operatives in various ways. Co-operatives are very  interesting.  There  can
be many different things, such as co-operatives of women in rural  areas  or
around marketing crafts. These are things that we will look at more  closely
and we have mandated the IDC to look at that.

Many of the members mentioned sectors that we  have  expanded  to.  I  think
that it is important that we have expand into franchising, IT  and  tourism.
These are critical sectors. To have  kept  the  IDC  exactly  where  it  was
before would not have been a useful exercise.

Lastly, one can see that the IDC can play  a  very  critical  role  in  some
industries. South Africa should be and is a producer of steel.  We  need  to
be competitive on this, but anybody who is watching this industry  worldwide
will know that it is a tremendously difficult time  for  the  world's  steel
industry.

We are fortunate to have the IDC, which can be a  player  in  assisting  the
restructuring. We are very pleased as Government with the recent  conclusion
of the negotiation between the IDC and Iscor, because  basically  what  that
is giving us is the  prospect  of  a  world  competitive  and  stable  steel
company in South Africa. That is an existing prospect.

As we work further the next round of discussion will be a bit wider  in  the
steel industry to rationalise some of the processes in steel so that we  can
stabilise South Africa's steel capacity and,  in  fact,  get  it  to  be  an
industry that will continue to grow. One can see that the IDC can play  many
important roles.

I would like to thank members for this amendment. I  look  forward  to  next
year's  discussions  where  we  will  go  further  on  this  very  important
institution that belongs to all South Africans. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with Section 65 of the Constitution.

                      MERCHANDISE MARKS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Mr Chairperson,  this  is  a  relatively
technical set of amendments.

As I think the Council has seen, we are continuously  refining  this  family
of  legislation  which  deals  with   intellectual   property,   trademarks,
counterfeit goods, etc. We have done that for two  basic  reasons:  firstly,
to ensure that our commercial environment  is  more  secure,  that  we  have
defined these issues very clearly, but,  secondly,  as  we  bring  ourselves
into line with the international practice, to make changes as  we  meet  our
obligations in terms of the various World Trade Organisation agreements.  We
need to make these changes.

These are relatively technical  clarifying  matters  distinguishing  between
different dimensions of this  merchandising  marks  body  of  legislation  -
between a trademark, a device, a common name, etc. These  have  to  be  more
clearly defined and I think that one sees  them  in  the  definitions  being
clarified very much more effectively.

The issue of, for example, well-known trademarks is one, we felt, we  should
clarify in the legislation. Many of the members may well remember the  well-
known public case  of  the  issue  of  McDonald's  earlier  on  in  the  new
democracy. We need to clarify these issues because  the  national  law  does
cover the concept of a well-known mark.

I would like to conclude by thanking the select committee here in  the  NCOP
because their sharp eyes and hard work picked up some amendments which  they
are proposing which, I think, are absolutely correct. I would like to  thank
them for the work done. It shows just how important hard-working  committees
are. [Applause.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Mr Chairperson, just for the sake of the House, the  issue  of
trademarks is something that,  sometimes,  sounds  like  something  for  big
business people really, but in fact more often  than  not  it  is  something
that affects small businesses in our constituencies,  small  business  which
are operating out there, small  businesses  which  are  making  T-shirts  or
caps, for example, or somebody who  is  trading  with  Nike  shoes  at  Park
station.

When one goes to Park station and  sees  somebody  selling  Nike  shoes  one
thinks that this is an original and says, ``Gosh! when I went  to  the  shop
up there, they cost R300, but this chap at Park station is selling them  for
R40''. Somebody is cheating somebody.

However, the fact of the matter is that the person who has been  cheated  is
the consumer. Because, at the end  of  the  day,  if  one  is  purchasing  a
particular product with a particular trademark on it, one wants to be  known
to be wearing this fashionable item. One buys it because of its  fashionable
quality and so forth. One goes home to wear it for one day  and  put  it  in
the washing machine. It comes  out  the  next  day  not  looking  like  Nike
anymore. It looks like ``isikorokoro'' [acrook] or something else.

The reason why a lot of this legislation is being put in place is,  firstly,
to protect consumers who  are  out  there  purchasing  and  engaged  in  the
marketplaces, particularly our small  entrepreneurs  who  are  emerging  all
over the show. The reason is to protect the consumers who are  dealing  with
entrepreneurs like that to ensure that, at least, consumers know  what  they
are buying. But the  second  thing  is  that  small  business  entrepreneurs
sometimes buy commodities from big wholesalers and  think  they  are  buying
the genuine product, because the big wholesaler is supplying  these  things,
some trademark or the other, like Nike, as I said.

They then go to Park station to sell it. Then the inspector  or  the  police
come there and say they are selling an illegal product and  they  confiscate
their goods. And when they do that, those people's entire capital  of  their
business gets taken by the police and, at the end of the  day,  they  remain
poorer than if they had not tried at all, because they  were  trying  to  do
some business. There are many operators out there who are  trading  in  this
kind of way and members will find in their constituencies  that  this  thing
is happening.

It is important for us as a country to make sure that  our  businesses  that
are operating out there, no matter how big or small they are, are  doing  so
in a way that respects  the  trademarks  and  trade  descriptions  of  other
businesses, because that is what creates a stable  trading  environment.  If
we do not do that as members of Parliament in  our  constituencies  we  will
simply create an environment in which no big company would  want  to  trade,
because they cannot be sure that when  they  trade  here  their  trademarks,
products and so forth will be respected. That is on the one hand.
On the other hand, our own businesses are trading  in  other  parts  of  the
world. They are taking commodities out to other  parts  of  the  world  that
have specific names, trade descriptions, trademarks and so forth.  We  would
expect our businesses  to  be  treated  in  the  same  way  in  those  other
countries. We would expect our commodities and our products to be  respected
in the same way so that our jobs in this part of the  world  are  protected.
In that kind of way, we need to make sure that  we  create  this  regulatory
environment in our country that says when one buys a Nike  product,  whether
one buys it from a street vendor, a big wholesaler or from Edgars, it  is  a
Nike product. If it is not a Nike product, please do not put  that  name  on
the product. Call it something else, develop another name or trademark.  Who
knows, maybe if one is a successful businessperson,  that  will  become  the
Nike of the future. That is very important about this thing.

During the process of the Bill we discovered that  there  was  a  particular
clause in the Bill that was not drafted, as the  Minister  says,  in  a  way
that was conducive for a good Bill. In fact, the clause would  have  deleted
the entire amendment of what a trade description is and we have  decided  to
raise that with the Ministry. In agreement with the state law  advisers  and
the Ministry and so forth, we took out the entire clause 2 in the Bill  that
had come through from the National Assembly.  Of  course,  that  also  meant
that the National Assembly's amendment had to be put out with the  whole  of
clause 2. We did that and, as the Minister has indicated, it was  a  process
of consulting with the department, the law advisers and  so  forth,  and  it
seems to have improved the Bill.

One final thing that is a  matter  of  concern  -  I  suppose  the  hon  the
Minister can respond to this when he replies and I think  also  generally  -
is the question of the Paris convention, according to which we  are  asking,
in terms of this Bill, for people to respect the coat of arms,  the  colours
of the flag and so forth, of various different  countries.  I  think  it  is
very important that when one puts a flag of a different country on the  back
of one's car, or even before one produces it, one must have  the  permission
of that country and so forth to do that.

But there are certain issues, for example in our restaurants.  If  one  goes
to a Portuguese restaurant, they will be flying a  Portuguese  flag  outside
or have a lot of memorabilia inside to create the ambience of  that  country
whose food they are displaying or supplying. In  the  same  way,  one  finds
many bars that do that, many places that  display  the  flags  of  different
countries to associate the product that they are supplying with the  culture
to which they subscribe which appends to that particular country's flag  and
emblem.

One finds that that  is  taking  place  throughout  the  country.  In  fact,
wherever we go, throughout the country, we do find from time to time - I  am
sure all members have seen this - the flag of some country or other in  some
place where one goes to eat, drink or even to do one's shopping.

One is a little bit concerned as to how the clause  14  amendment  would  be
implemented. Are we going to first  make  the  country  aware  of  this  new
provision which says that one may not put up the flags, memorabilia  and  so
forth of other countries without  the  necessary  authority  of  either  the
Minister or a person inside  the  country,  as  well  as  the  authority  of
somebody outside the country?

There are a number of  clauses  there,  about  four  of  five.  Clause  1(a)
relates to authorisation in writing by or on behalf of the Minister;  clause
1(b) relates to a competent authority in the Republic or in  the  convention
country; clause 1(c) relates to whether putting up a  particular  emblem  or
flag is also going to associate control and warranties. For example, if  one
is selling Portuguese food and, therefore, puts up the  Portuguese  flag  in
one's restaurant, does that mean that  one  is  getting  genuine  Portuguese
food? I think clause 1(c) would address that  kind  of  thing.  Clause  1(d)
would address abbreviations and so forth.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time has expired.
Mr M V MOOSA: In conclusion, I just want to say that we support  this  Bill.
We think that it is very important  for  our  economy,  but  some  of  these
things may need some clarification. [Applause]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, baie dankie vir  die  geleentheid.  Ek  wil
die agb Moosa bedank vir die verduideliking wat hy gegee het,  want  dit  is
belangrik dat ons duidelikheid kry oor  wat  handelsmerke  werklik  is.  Die
Nuwe NP steun die doelwit van hierdie wetsontwerp,  en  ook  die  toepassing
daarvan.

Dit is tog belangrik om uit te brei op wat die agb Moosa gesê  het,  naamlik
dat wanneer ons agterkom dat 'n produk nie die ware Jakob is  nie,  ons  nie
moet wag vir die polisie of die Regering of iemand om die  persoon  aan  die
dag te bring nie. Ons as gewone burgers het 'n  verantwoordelikheid  om  die
soort van bedrog aan die man te bring en dit  self  te  gaan  aanmeld,  want
andersins ondersteun ons dit, en dan brei ons  die  soort  van  bedrywighede
eerder uit tot nadeel van onsself en die handel in die algemeen.
Iets wat vir my ongemaklik is, en ek hoop  die  agb  Minister  kan  vir  ons
duidelikheid gee oor hoe dit anders gehanteer kan word, is dat wanneer  daar
wel groot hoeveelhede klere, skoene en dies meer gekonfiskeer word,  en  dit
in die tydvak waarin ons 'n klomp armoede  het,  dit  dan  uitgebrand  word.
Erens sê my gevoel vir my dat dit verkeerd is, in  die  lig  van  die  groot
armoede in ons land, dat klere, kos en dies meer, verbrand word.

Ek verstaan die probleme wat daarmee  gepaard  gaan.  Is  daar  geen  manier
waarop 'n mens  daarby  kan  verbykom  en  dit  sinvoller  kan  aanwend  tot
voordeel van die arm mense in ons land nie?

Die  voorgestelde  wysigings  verwys  ook  na  handelinge   wat   op   valse
handelsbeskrywings  neerkom,  en   die   onwettigverklaring   van   sodanige
aktiwiteite. Ons steun dit.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, thank you very much for  the  opportunity.
I want to thank the hon Moosa for the explanation he  gave,  because  it  is
very important that we get clarity about what trademarks  exactly  are.  The
New NP supports the aim of this Bill, and also the implementation thereof.

It is surely important to elaborate on what the hon Moosa said, namely  that
when we realise that a product is not the real McCoy we should not wait  for
the police or the Government or someone else to bring the  person  to  book.
We as ordinary citizens have a responsibility  to  eradicate  this  type  of
fraud and to report it ourselves, because if we do not then we  support  it,
and then we extend this type of activity to our own  disadvantage  and  that
of trade in general.

Something which makes me feel uneasy, and I hope that the hon  the  Minister
can give us clarity on how we can deal with this in some other way, is  that
when large quantities of clothing, shoes and so forth  are  confiscated  the
goods are burnt and this at a time when we have great poverty. Somewhere  my
feelings tell me it is is wrong that clothes, food and so  forth  are  burnt
in the light of the great poverty in our country.
I understand the problems which go with that.  Is  there  no  other  way  in
which one can get past this and apply it more meaningfully to the  advantage
of the poor people in our country?

The proposed amendments also refer to dealings which amounts to false  trade
descriptions, and the declaring of such activities as  illegal.  We  support
this. [Applause.]]

MR M J BHENGU: Chairperson, I think it is perhaps  proper  that  one  should
congratulate the chairperson of our select committee, the hon Mr  Moosa,  on
the way he actually piloted the Bill. I think  one  should  also  thank  the
Minister for the way he has explained it, together with Mr Moosa.

I think, therefore, that one has to emphasise the fact that the  control  of
trademarks in our country is very important. It  actually  makes  a  lot  of
sense that we should prohibit the unauthorised use of our national  symbols,
particularly our national flag and things like that. I  would  imagine  that
if we do not have such control measures in place, we would have a  situation
in which people would use these national symbols to such an extent that  the
essence, the dignity and sovereignty of our country would be demeaned. So  I
think one should congratulate the Minister on that.

The technical amendments were very clear and straightforward,  and  the  IFP
actually supports the Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson,  I  wish  to  very  briefly
illustrate, regarding some of the questions that have  been  raised  on  the
issue of trademarks, one other reason why it would be good for  members  and
respected leaders of the community to stress this again. If  one  takes  the
example of a small caterer, manufacturer of clothing  or  whatever,  as  one
develops the quality of one's product one tries to give it an  identity.  As
that identity comes, it has value to one because  people  learn  to  respect
and value the quality of  that  product.  That  is  the  real  origin  of  a
trademark; that is, if I develop something and its quality  is  accepted  by
the market, then I can put my mark on it.

As we develop our small and medium  businesses,  crafts  and  all  sorts  of
cultural dimensions, we should not underestimate  how  important  that  will
be. If nobody respects that, we are going to have  a  problem  because  then
there would be no incentive to improve our product and  capture  its  value.
So I think that this is a very practical issue about the development of  our
economy. As more people participate in the economy, we  need  to  understand
the value of these marks, devices, etc.

The Paris convention is an important convention because, basically, what  it
says is that if a member state confers  the  status  of  a  trademark  on  a
product, other member states  should  respect  that.  I  think  that  is  an
important thing.

With regard to flags, as the hon Moosa has indicated, it can  be  difficult.
But what one is looking for here is what  the  hon  Bhengu  said,  that  the
flags of countries should be treated with a degree of respect  and  decorum.
If one reads our flag, for instance, it tells one how to fly it,  what  goes
on top, what is at the bottom and how it should look.  That  is  really  the
purpose of trying to do it. Because of the excitement around our  own  flag,
one would recall that it was everywhere. One does not  want  to  stop  that,
but it must be treated with decorum.

This provision really depends a lot more on people complaining  rather  than
us enforcing it. I think that if we see that our flag, for example, is  used
without respect for it, it is within one's rights to complain. We will  then
act against those involved. Equally, if a tourist comes here  from  Portugal
or somewhere and sees that someone in South Africa is  treating  their  flag
with disrespect and a lack of decorum, they can complain  and  we  will  act
against that. That is more the way we should see this. It is an  attempt  to
make it possible to protect.

It is quite true that the Counterfeit Goods Act is linked  to  this  Act  in
that one can seize the products, and  all  members  made  mention  of  that.
Practicalities dictate how we should deal with these products. For  example,
many of the products seized comprise electrical equipment, shaving  products
and all those kinds of things. Thus, one  cannot  just  go  and  give  those
products to the poor.

What we are really talking about here is clothing and so  on.  However,  the
difficulty is that when one seizes these things, it might  be  all  size  11
shoes or all size 20 jackets. So it is really not so practical to give  them
to the poor as people would expect. Although seizure is  under  the  Customs
Act, for people who bring such products under the wrong duty  it  is  a  bit
easier.

What we do is that we do not allow these products to  easily  go  back  into
the market. But for recent floods and stuff like that,  we  have  authorised
that our emergency relief centres can use them. But  we  have  to  watch  it
because if one puts it back into the market it will start being traded.  So,
generally speaking, we destroy the product. We are  looking  at  a  project,
with the union movement, to break up the  clothing  and  use  it  for  other
products. But, in certain circumstances, we do use these  seized  goods  for
relief work.

I thank members for supporting this and for  the  sharp  eyes  they  had  in
checking the Act. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

                                  GAS BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Chairperson, hon members,  allow
me to introduce the South African Gas Bill which is a  regulatory  framework
for the gas industry in South Africa. Owing to the significance  of  gas  to
our people, our economy and our prosperity, I think I  should  indicate  why
such a Bill is necessary.
The Bill is a realisation of at least two components of  Government's  White
Paper on Energy Policy released during December 1998.  The  first  is  about
increasing energy security through  diversity  of  supply,  and  the  second
states that a gas regulatory authority will be established  to  implement  a
minimal regulatory regime consistent  with  the  orderly  development  of  a
competitive gas industry through granting  licences  for  the  transmission,
storage, distribution and trading of piped gas.

Over the past few years the use  of  coal  gas  has  expanded  rapidly  from
approximately 25 million gigajoules in  1994  to  approximately  40  million
gigajoules in 2000, a growth of approximately 60% in just  six  years.  This
growth is indicative of the potential for the expansion of the gas  industry
in South Africa.

Currently, the development of the gas industry in South Africa  is  expected
to be undertaken primarily in  the  private  sector.  Such  investments  are
large. For example, envisaged cross-border gas  transmission  pipelines  can
cost in the order  of  US  $500  million.  In  order  to  manage  the  risk,
investors have requested regulatory certainty from the Government.

Such  certainty  will  facilitate  investments  in  both  the  upstream  and
downstream sectors of the  gas  industry.  Not  only  will  such  regulatory
certainty ensure investments and orderly development in  South  Africa,  but
it will also lead to regional development. Internationally, natural  gas  is
recognised as the fuel of the 21st  century.  The  use  of  natural  gas  is
rapidly expanding worldwide. It has a  number  of  environmental  advantages
compared with fossil fuel, such as oil and  coal.  Not  only  does  it  burn
cleaner, producing less smoke and sulphur oxides, but it also produces  less
carbon dioxide per unit of energy, and therefore has less of  an  impact  on
global warming.

With the established the need for a gas regulatory regime, the Gas Bill  has
been subject to a comprehensive consultation process. I would like  to  walk
hon members through  the  main  aspects  of  that  consultation  process  in
chronological order.

A gas policy working group was  formed  during  May  1994,  whose  work  was
superseded by the White Paper process during  1995.  A  SADC  report  titled
``Study of the economics of natural gas  utilisation  in  Southern  Africa''
was released during June 1995. A team from the World Bank  made  two  visits
to South Africa. A senior official of the US department  of  energy  visited
South Africa on three occasions to advise on gas policy,  as  we  are  quite
aware that the US is ahead in terms of gas. Eighteen written submissions  on
gas were received for the gas component of the draft  White  Paper.  A  team
from the International Energy Agency made two visits to  South  Africa.  Two
contiguous gas workshops were held during October 1996.

During February and March 2000, the department  had  two  further  workshops
attended by about  65  representatives  of  stakeholders.  In  addition,  my
department has held a large  number  of  individual  meetings  and  briefing
sessions with stakeholders.
May I now turn to the objectives of the Bill. The gas industry  conforms  to
the criteria  of  natural  monopoly.  Under  monopoly  conditions,  players,
especially consumers, expect a certain amount of protection from abuse.

As  Government,  we  have  set  the  following   objectives:   the   orderly
development, operation and provision of gas  services,  the  key  being  the
transmission infrastructure; ensuring  the  provision  of  gas  as  soon  as
possible at the lowest possible  price;  promoting  competitive  markets  by
facilitating  gas-on-gas   competition   through   third-party   access   to
transmission  pipelines;  and  balancing   conflicting   interests   between
consumers and suppliers.

The purposes of the Gas Bill are to promote the orderly development  of  the
piped gas  industry;  to  establish  a  national  regulatory  framework;  to
establish a national gas regulator as the  custodian  and  enforcer  of  the
national  regulatory  framework;  and  to  provide  for  matters   concerned
therewith. The Gas Bill is limited to piped gas and covers  neither  gas  in
cylinders and reticulation, nor upstream gas  matters,  as  we  all  know  -
those are addressed in the Minerals and Petroleum Development Bill which  is
under consideration.

I will now address some of the features of the Bill. I mentioned earlier  on
that the Bill does not cover reticulation. In terms of section 4(b)  of  the
Constitution, gas reticulation is a local government matter  and  I  believe
hon members have an interest in that. Gas reticulation  is  not  defined  in
the Constitution. But,  in  the  Gas  Bill,  it  is  defined  by  a  general
operating pressure of less than two bar gauge. Clause 10 addresses a  number
of  important  safeguards  to  ensure  both  the  independence  of  the  gas
regulator and the fairness of its decisions.

With regard  to  regulatory  infrastructure,  the  Cabinet  has  decided  to
investigate the possibility of rationalising or  consolidating  the  various
regulators. This could be done on various levels such as shared  facilities,
a common secretariat, cross-membership  of  regulatory  boards  or  combined
regulatory boards such as an energy regulator. My  department  is  currently
investigating this matter.

Clauses 11(5) and (6) of the Bill ensure that the necessary  flexibility  is
retained to implement the decisions of Cabinet in  this  regard.  Clause  12
deals with the funds of the gas regulator. It is anticipated  that  the  gas
regulator will  have  to  be  established,  using  appropriations  from  the
National Revenue Fund, to be followed by funding from levies  imposed  under
separate legislation.

Licences will be required for the gas facilities of  transmission,  storage,
distribution, liquefaction and regasification or the conversion of  existing
infrastructure into such facilities. Separate licences will be required  for
the activities of construction, operation and trading in gas. Such  licences
are issued for a period  of  25  years  or  a  longer  period,  as  the  gas
regulator may determine.

Clause 36 makes provision for the Mozambique Gas  Project.  Investors  in  a
fledgling industry need assurance of their  investment.  Therefore,  in  the
absence of a specific piece of  legislation,  the  Ministers  of  Trade  and
Industry and of Minerals and Energy agreed  with  Sasol  on  certain  issues
pertaining to a natural gas transmission pipeline, between Temane and  Pande
gas fields in Mozambique and Gauteng in South Africa.

The basis of the agreement between the Government of the Republic  of  South
Africa and Sasol Ltd was signed during October  and  November  2000  by  the
Ministers of Trade and Industry and of Minerals and Energy and Sasol.

The definitive agreement was approved by Cabinet on Wednesday, 19  September
2001. The agreement between  the  Government  and  Sasol  is  referenced  in
clause 26 of the Gas  Bill.  The  terms  of  the  agreement  relate  to  the
conditions of licences  scheduled  to  be  issued  to  Sasol  regarding  the
following matters: exclusive rights and periods granted in  respect  of  the
transmission  and  distribution  of   gas;   third-party   access   to   the
transmission pipeline  from  Mozambique  and  to  certain  Sasol  pipelines;
prices charged by Sasol for gas; Sasol's  obligation  to  supply  customers,
distributors and reticulators  with  gas;  and  the  administration  of  the
agreement by the gas regulator.

The agreement binds the gas regulator until 10 years after natural  gas  was
first  received  from  Mozambique,  which  will  be  during  2004.   Besides
addressing the legislative requirements  for  the  development  of  the  gas
industry,  Government  has  also  entered  into  a  cross-border  gas  trade
agreement with Mozambique to facilitate the movement of natural  gas  across
the border. A similar agreement is being negotiated with Namibia.

Gas is a small but rapidly  expanding  industry  in  South  Africa  and  the
southern region. This Bill is essential legislation to promote  the  orderly
development of the piped gas industry, to establish  a  national  regulatory
framework, to establish a  national  gas  regulator  as  the  custodian  and
enforcer of the national regulatory framework and  to  provide  for  related
matters.

Allow me to introduce this Bill to the NCOP. [Applause.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, you are going to get sick and tired of  my  voice
today, as this is the third speech I have  made  in  one  afternoon.  It  is
unbelievable! I did not realise you loved me that much.

Energy is one of the most fundamental  aspects  of  human  development.  One
cannot  do  anything  without  electricity  or  some  form  of  energy.  Any
manufacturing process, anything one wants to make,  anything  one  wants  to
cook, anything one wants to eat, anything one wants to build,  whatever  one
needs to do, one needs energy.

In South Africa, one of the primary sources of energy has always been  coal.
In fact, electricity in this  country  is  generated  primarily  by  burning
coal. Some hon members, some of  the  ``magogos''  who  are  here,  the  old
ladies and gentlemen, will remember that once upon a time one  used  to  get
gas in certain areas. I know some townships and suburbs of Johannesburg  had
gas reticulating through them. Instead of using electricity, one  could  use
gas to cook and heat up the house,  and  so  forth.  For  some  reason  that
industry never took off, mostly, perhaps, because it is cheaper to  generate
energy through coal. Gas has always been more expensive.

A new era is dawning in this country. With this Bill we are looking  at  the
possibility of utilising gas as a source and form of energy in  a  very  big
way, as the hon the Deputy Minister has indicated. Many people are  speaking
of gas as the energy source for the 21st century and  there  are  very  good
reasons why they say that.

One of the most fundamental reasons is because of all  the  new  sustainable
development  and  environmental  arguments.  Next  year,  during  the  Earth
Summit, hon members will hear that one of the biggest problems with the  way
in which energy is being used  at  the  moment  is,  firstly,  that  we  are
wasting energy and that we do not use it efficiently.

Secondly, although we use energy, we destroy  everything  else  to  generate
that energy. When we generate energy out of coal, we destroy the  atmosphere
and we do a whole range of things.

Gas is one of the cleanest forms of energy, it is much  more  efficient,  is
prone to less wastage, and so forth. At the same time, it can do  a  lot  of
what some of the other energy sources can do, and more.

What is more interesting is that gas, as  part  of  the  infrastructure  and
economic development of Southern Africa, has become a  fundamental  part  of
the future of economic development in this part of the world.

Not so long ago two huge gas  fields  were  discovered  in  Mozambique,  the
Pande and the Temane gas fields.

After that a huge gas field was discovered in Namibia, called the  Kudu  gas
field. That gas field is being operated and owned by a consortium of  Shell.
More recently, a few months ago, members would have seen Tokyo  Sexwale  all
over the media. This was because a massive gas  field  was  discovered  just
off the west coast near Saldanha Bay. It is called the Ibhubesi  Gas  Field.
Apparently there is enough gas in that gas field to supply the energy  needs
for the city of Cape Town for  the  next  300  years.  But  I  do  not  know
anything about gas.

Some of these developments are becoming very exciting from the way in  which
we are going to develop the needs and  infrastructure  of  Southern  Africa.
The gas pipeline that the hon the Deputy Minister mentioned  will  be  built
by Sasol at a cost of R10 billion from the Pande and Temane fields  all  the
way down to Sasolburg. It will be used by Sasol  plants.  Sasol  plants  are
being converted over time to utilise gas. This is because up until now  they
have utilised coal. In fact, they will  be  building  new  plants  alongside
Sasol that will also utilise gas.

The Kudu and Ibhubesi gas fields are going to be building pipelines that  go
all the way down past Cape Town, all the way to Mossgas. From  Mossgas  they
will build those pipelines all the way to  the  Eastern  Cape  and  to  Port
Elizabeth. This means that from both sides of the country we will have  very
powerful energy sources in the  form  of  gas  that  will  go  to  different
industrial  parts.  This  is  a  fundamentally  significant  and   important
development.

This is important because some argue that, for  example,  the  war  that  is
taking place between the United States and Afghanistan has to  do  with  gas
that has been discovered in that  particular  region  of  the  world,  which
includes Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. There  was  a  newspaper  article  this
Sunday by a man called Pilger who said that the main reason for the  war  is
energy, oil and gas. There have been arguments about that fact that the  war
against Iraq was about oil. We know that there is terrorism  in  the  world,
and we condemn it, but we also know that countries do things  sometimes  for
economic expediency. It may very well be  that  this  journalist  who  wrote
about this may be correct. We do not know.

There are a number of things that  need  to  happen  for  gas  to  become  a
successful source of energy in this country. The one thing  is  pricing.  We
have to ensure that the industry prices  gas  in  such  a  way  that  it  is
accessible to all the people of our country. Secondly, it is vital that  the
industry ensures that the usage of gas is accessible  to  small  and  medium
enterprises and therefore the reticulation  process  of  this  gas  must  be
competitive and much wider than just the big players that  are  involved  in
the gas industry at  the  moment.  It  is  very  important  that  those  two
fundamentals are addressed.

One of the things that we were  unhappy  about  is  the  way  in  which  the
agreement had been signed with Sasol regarding  the  Mozambique  gas  field.
The prices for the gas were going to  be  determined  on  a  basket  of  six
European country prices. Now we know what the forex situation  is  like.  We
know for a fact that this agreement has been signed and there is nothing  we
can do about it. But, at the end of the day, it is going  to  mean  that  as
Sasol argues, production costs are done in dollars, but  we  know  that  the
bulk of the production costs will be in rands.  We  do  not  see  why  these
resources should be so expensive.

We have expressed our displeasure  about  this  in  the  committee,  but  we
understand that the agreement has been signed and we can  do  nothing  about
this. However, we hope that the pricing mechanisms of the  gas  fields  that
are being  developed  in  other  parts  of  the  country  are  going  to  be
competitive. We also hope that if other gas fields  are  discovered  in  the
region which will supply the area where the  Sasol  gas  fields  are  found,
they will be priced more competitively than the  gas  that  will  come  from
Temane and Pande. We  hope  that  this  competition  is  introduced  in  the
industry because this will allow gas to be consumed on a massive  scale  and
be utilised effectively.

The Bill creates a gas regulator. The gas regulator will basically  comprise
five non-full-time members who will, on an ongoing basis, look at  what  the
public interest is. Some of the powers that the gas regulator has, if I  may
just go through them  very  quickly,  are  to  ensure  that  it  issues  the
licences for the  construction,  the  conversion,  the  infrastructure,  the
distribution and the reticulation of the gas. Secondly, the  regulator  will
be making sure that sufficient information is gathered  about  the  industry
and is supplied to those who need it. It will ensure consultation  with  the
Government and will ensure the regulation of prices. Outside  the  agreement
on Pande, of course prices will have to be regulated in  a  whole  range  of
the other ways and the gas regulator will be involved in that.

We know also that the gas regulator will have powers  to  expropriate  land,
where necessary, in order to ensure  the  success  of  these  pipelines  and
infrastructure. The gas regulator will be required  to  promote  competition
in the industry. It will also have to make sure that there  is  optimal  use
of gas as a resource in this country; and there is a whole  range  of  other
powers that it has.

One of the most interesting and important powers that the gas regulator  has
is that it will act in the public  interest.  The  gas  regulator  has  been
given the power in this law to act  in  the  public  interest,  not  in  the
interests of one company,  not  in  the  interests  of  one  player  in  the
industry, but in the public interest in everything  that  it  does.  In  the
public interest could mean that the regulator has to balance  economics,  in
other words, the cost of building a pipeline and the cost  of  the  industry
itself, with the interests of consumers and with members and  me  as  people
in the public eye.

These are some of the things. I see that the  Chairperson  is  beginning  to
make flirting eyes at me, which means my time is up. [Laughter.]

I want to thank the hon the Deputy Minister and the department for their co-
operation. We want to let hon members know that Mr Crompton  never  came  to
our committee to brief us, but  was  involved  every  day  in  the  National
Assembly process. We want hon members to take  that  up  with  Mr  Crompton.
Apart from that, we were very happy with the process from the  department  -
we were happy with the engagement. We made one little amendment,  which  hon
members might have seen. It is insignificant.  It  was  really  a  technical
amendment, but it just cleans up the law a little bit. Apart  from  that,  I
call on the House to support this Bill. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  Moosa,  now  you  have  let  the
people know that I gave you an extra second. [Laughter.]

Mnr A E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Voorsitter,  die  agb  Moosa  het  nou  vir  ons  'n
breedvoerig prentjie geskilder oor die  groterwordende  gasbedryf  in  Suid-
Afrika en alles wat dit behels. Hy het nie genoeg tyd  aan  die  wetsontwerp
as sodanig bestee nie omdat u hom nie genoeg bykomende tyd gegee het nie.

Ek wil enkele punte  verder  uitlig.  Die  Gaswetsontwerp  sal  die  wetlike
raamwerk skep waarin die groeiende gasbedryf kan funksioneer. Dit  maak  ook
voorsiening vir die instel van 'n onafhanklike Gasreguleerder, soos genoem.

Ons het met enkele doelstellings begin en ek wil daarop uitbrei.  Dit  sluit
in die volhoubare, ordelike en  doeltreffende  ontwikkeling  en  bedryf  van
gasvervoer,   die   verskaffing   en   bevordering    van    bergings-    en
verspreidingsgeriewe en om belegging in die  gasbedryf  te  vergemaklik,  om
maatskappye in die gasbedryf wat deur histories  benadeelde  Suid-Afrikaners
besit en beheer word, deur middel van die toeken van lisensies  te  bevorder
ten einde hulle in staat te stel om mededingend te kan word.

Verder, om die ontwikkeling van 'n mededingende mark vir gas  en  gasdienste
te bevorder, om die handel in gas  tussen  Suid-Afrika  en  ander  lande  te
vergemaklik en om bekostigbare en veilige toegang tot gas te verseker.

Fyner  besonderhede  van  die  wetsontwerp  behels   die   skep,   funksies,
samestelling en pligte van die onafhanklike Gasreguleerder  en  daarom  gaan
ek nie daarop uitbrei nie.

Die  fondse  en  finansiële  rekords  van  die  onafhanklike  Gasreguleerder
waaroor die Ouditeur-generaal verslag sal doen en verslaglewering  deur  die
onafhanklike Gasreguleerder self, word ook duidelik omskryf.

Daar word in besonderhede ingegaan op die aktiwiteite waarvoor  'n  lisensie
benodig word, die wyse waarop aansoek vir 'n lisensie gedoen moet word,  die
voorwaardes vir die toekenning van 'n lisensie, wysigings aan  lisensies  en
redes vir die intrek van 'n lisensie.

Maar, aangesien die begroting van die Departement van  Minerale  en  Energie
nie vir die skepping en bedryf van 'n gasreguleerder voorsiening  maak  nie,
sal die departement vir 'n bykomende R2,1  miljoen  voorsiening  moet  maak.
Voorsiening sal ook gemaak moet word vir die daaropvolgende finansiële  jare
wat dit nodig gaan wees om die Gasreguleerder te bedryf. Ek  is  seker  daar
is 'n goeie verhouding met die Minister van Finansies  om  dit  wel  reg  te
kry.

'n Wye veld  van  ondernemings  en  entiteite  wat  belanghebbendes  in  die
gasbedryf  is,  en  mag  wees,  is  tydens  die  formulering   van   hierdie
wetsontwerp geraadpleeg. Daarom is ons tevrede  om  hierdie  wetsontwerp  te
steun. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, the hon  Mr  Moosa  has  just  sketched  a
detailed picture of the growing gas industry in South Africa and  everything
that it entails. He did not devote sufficient time  to  the  Bill  as  such,
because you did not afford him sufficient additional time.

I want to further highlight a few points.  The  Gas  Bill  will  create  the
legal framework within which the growing gas industry can function. It  also
provides for the establishment of an independent gas regulator, as has  been
mentioned.

We started with a few objectives and I would like to expand  on  them.  They
include the sustainable, orderly and effective development and operation  of
gas transmission, the provision and promotion of  storage  and  distribution
facilities and to facilitate investment in  the  gas  industry,  to  promote
companies in the gas industry that are owned or controlled  by  historically
disadvantaged South Africans by means of licence conditions so as to  enable
them to become competitive.

Furthermore, to promote the development of competitive markets for  gas  and
gas services, to facilitate the gas trade between  the  Republic  and  other
countries and to ensure affordable and safe access to gas.

Greater details of the Bill entail the creation, functions, composition  and
duties of the independent gas regulator, and that is why I am not  going  to
expand on it any further.

The funds and financial records of  the  independent  gas  regulator,  about
which  the  Auditor-General  is  going  to  report,  and  reporting  by  the
independent gas regulator him or herself, are also clearly defined.

There are details of the activities for which a  licence  is  required,  the
way that application should be made for a licence, the  conditions  for  the
allocation of a licence, amendments to licences and reasons for  revoking  a
licence.

But, since the budget of the Department of  Minerals  and  Energy  does  not
provide for the creation and operation of a gas  regulator,  the  department
will have to provide for an additional R2,1  million.  Provision  will  also
have to be made  for  the  subsequent  financial  years  that  it  would  be
necessary to run the gas regulator. I  am  certain  that  there  is  a  good
enough relationship with the Minister of Finance  to  succeed  in  achieving
this.

A wide field of enterprises and entities that are stakeholders  in  the  gas
industry, and could well be, was consulted during the  formulation  of  this
Bill. We are therefore satisfied to support this Bill.]

Mr J L THERON: Mr Chairperson, the  official  opposition  will  support  the
Bill. [Interjections.]

The gas industry is set to enter a period of rapid expansion  based  on  the
new natural gas fields of the West Coast  and  in  Mozambique.  For  several
decades South Africa has had a relatively small gas industry  based  on  gas
produced from coal. If one looks at the market  share  per  energy  carrier,
gas is at about 2%, oil products at 32%, coal  at  28%  and  electricity  at
22%. A further approximately 90% of electricity  is  coal  fired,  deepening
the reliance on coal in the energy equation in South Africa.

With the successful gas exploration projects in  and  around  South  Africa,
namely the Temane and Pande gas fields in Mozambique as well as  Forest  and
Kudu off our West Coast, gas has  the  potential  to  become  a  significant
player in the energy equation of South Africa. Once  these  gas  fields  are
being fully exploited, gas contribution is set to rise to 7%, the  norm  for
industrialised countries being between 15% and 20%.

As  a  result  of  the  discovery  of  economically  viable  gas  fields  in
Mozambique and off the West Coast of South Africa, it has  become  necessary
to provide a framework for  the  development  of  the  industry  which  will
facilitate  investment  in  the  industry  as  well  as  ensure  safety  and
environmental standards for the pipeline gas industry.

With regard to the objectives of  the  Bill,  the  official  opposition  ...
[Laughter.] ... also subscribes to these objectives: to promote and  develop
transmission, storage and distribution facilities and trading  services,  to
facilitate investment in the  industry  and  to  ensure  safe  transmission,
storage and distribution of gas ... [Interjections.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on  a  point  of  order:  On  the  official
speakers' list we have Mr Nelson Raju. I just want to  enquire  whether  the
official opposition kicked him  out,  and  whether  he  has  been  replaced.
[Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! He may answer  you  during  tea  time,
because the list issue is mine, not his.

Mr J L THERON: We support the objectives of the Bill.

With  regard  to  the  national  gas  regulator,  the  Bill  establishes  an
independent gas regulator, setting out the constitution,  powers,  functions
and methods of operation of the gas regulator.

One of the primary problems of the pipeline  industry  is  that  there  will
only be one transmission line from  the  Sasol  gas  fields  in  Mozambique.
Therefore, the challenge was to provide a regulatory environment that  would
ensure third-party access should other fields come  on  stream  and,  hence,
encourage competition in the industry. One of the principal objects  of  the
Bill is to encourage competition in the industry.

With  regard  to  the  gas  licences  and  registration,  all  companies  or
institutions  transmitting,  distributing  and  reticulating  gas  will   be
required to register with the regulator  and  obtain  a  licence.  The  Bill
provides for  the  methodology  for  obtaining  the  licence  and  sets  out
conditions for the granting of licences. Mechanisms for enforcement are  put
in place.

With regard to the financial implications for the state, the  Department  of
Minerals and Energy's budget does not  provide  for  the  establishment  and
running of a gas regulator. Therefore, when the Gas Act is promulgated,  the
department will require an extra R2,1 million to run the gas  regulator  per
year. This is a small investment, but this is the type  of  investment  that
we need for new  ventures  to  stimulate  our  economy  and  to  create  new
sustainable jobs.

In conclusion, natural gas will not only broaden the energy  mix  but  could
also provide a cost-efficient and environmentally friendly source of  energy
for South Africa. It is the tabling of this  Bill  that  gives  an  investor
such as Sasol the confidence to proceed with a R10  billion  investment,  an
investment which will kick-start the industry.

Finally, we believe  that  this  Bill  will  deliver  specific  benefits  to
Southern Africa, such as major investments in infrastructure,  contributions
to economic growth, new  job  opportunities,  economic  empowerment  of  the
historically disadvantaged, increased access  to  new  technologies,  skills
training, and an increased tax base. We therefore must  support  this  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chairperson, Deputy Minister and hon members, I  must  first
state that when we talk about this gas or ``tlakatse'' in  our  communities,
it somehow creates confusion because one needs rather to be talking  in  the
vernacular for people to understand  better.  Nevertheless,  there  is  very
little room to do that in technical Bills like this one.

Strong potential exists for significant growth in our  local  gas  industry.
Although there is a relatively low level of known  domestic  gas  resources,
it is probably because our gas industry  is  on  the  brink  of  significant
expansion, owing to natural gas field discoveries in  South  Africa  and  in
our neighbouring countries.

In fact, our prospects for  sustained  natural  gas  production  received  a
major boost in March 2000 with the discovery of  offshore  reserves  on  the
West Coast of  South  Africa,  with  an  estimated  recovery  reserve  of  3
trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

The recovery of these reserves of natural gas has  raised  the  prospect  of
increased domestic and foreign  investment  in  our  natural  gas  reserves.
Foreign investors include two major US-based oil  corporations,  which  have
bought  significant  shares  in  our  natural  gas   and   oil   exploration
initiatives.  These  investments  also  had  positive  spin-offs  for  black
economic participation with black empowerment groups,  such  as  Mvelaphanda
Holdings and Egoli Empowerment Holdings which have benefited from  increased
foreign investment.

The recent expansion of our natural gas industry exposes us to a  number  of
challenges. The most important of these challenges is  the  creation  of  an
adequate legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  the  industry,  which  will
prevent  the  monopoly  aspect  and  level  the  playing  fields  to  enable
participation  by  companies  in  the  gas  industry  that  are  owned   and
controlled by historically disadvantaged South Africans.

The main thrust of this Bill is  to  establish  an  appropriate  climate  to
facilitate the development of the industry. It  is,  therefore,  appropriate
that some kind of oversight mechanism  over  the  gas  regulator  should  be
contained within the Bill. I am happy to say that the Bill does indeed  seek
to do this. It sets out strict requirements for the appointment  of  members
of the gas regulator and carefully sets out the duties of such members.  The
Bill prohibits, for example, a  person  who  has  any  relationship  with  a
company engaged in  the  gas  industry  from  being  appointed  to  the  gas
regulator.

Furthermore, members of the gas regulator must  act  in  a  manner  that  is
required and expected of a person placed in a position of  trust,  and  they
must act independently  of  any  undue  influence.  They  also  must  recuse
themselves from any matter pending before the gas regulator  in  which  they
have a direct or indirect interest.

Finally, I am confident that  this  Bill  will  contribute  to  the  orderly
development  of  our  gas  industry,  and  will  ensure  that  the  industry
significantly  contributes  towards  our  national  objectives  of  economic
growth, job creation and social development.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINERALS  AND  ENERGY:  Chairperson,  the  microphone
system shows its age.

I would like to point out and assure the members of this House that  we  are
definitely going to take all the issues that they have raised on board.

In response to hon Moosa, who raised the question of pricing with regard  to
the gas industry, as members are quite aware, we see  this  as  one  of  the
major social factors to improve the lives of our people. Hence, we  want  to
make sure that it becomes competitive, but also efficient because  sometimes
competition might work negatively.  In  this  particular  instance,  we  are
going to ensure that it works to the advantage of our people. We  hope  that
the regulation, the establishment and the discovery of the gas  itself  will
broaden the market, as we all know that we come from a past  where  gas  was
never a major player in the energy sector.

One also needs to bear in mind that if we reflect back, we  had  hoped  that
when we dealt with the question of  poverty  alleviation,  one  of  the  key
areas which was going to be utilised for the benefit  of  the  poor  in  our
country was gas. But when one looks at the current situation, it  could  not
happen because of the nature of the  structure  of  gas.  It  is  also  very
expensive for our people. Hence, if that had to happen,  only  business  was
going to benefit from this. We are addressing  this  through  the  Bill  and
also in practice.

Hon Moosa raised the question of Mozambique and the Sasol agreement. We  are
aware about the concerns in terms of competition and monopoly. It is one  of
those issues which we have to deal with. I think one must  acknowledge  that
we were dealing with the question of Mozambique  and  the  Sasol  agreement,
and ourselves as Government without a regulatory  system;  hence  there  was
nothing to guide us. Maybe  that  might  have  contributed  to  the  current
problem we are facing. But we  hope  that  the  future  will  be  completely
different from what the situation is right now.

I also agree with the member that  we  hope  that  given  the  way  we  have
formulated the regulator, we will be able to act in  the  interests  of  our
people more than in the interests of big  business,  and  also  be  able  to
allow small businesses to have access to this  particular  industry  without
being squeezed.

We are quite aware of members'  concern  regarding  the  amendment.  We  are
going to take this on board. We will make sure that we address  this  matter
of section 21. We hope that this will meet members' needs  and  concerns  as
the NCOP, but also generally as legislatures. I just want to say also, as  I
talk about this, that I have noted members' concerns about Dr  Crompton.  We
will raise this with him.

The question of the concerns of members of the NCOP  needs  to  be  attended
to, but I have also indicated that there is a  portfolio  committee  sitting
tomorrow, and I have informed members of this committee from the  NCOP  that
it will be important for them to  be  part  of  that.  I  do  not  know  the
schedules of members, but it will  be  important  for  them  to  attend  the
portfolio committee briefing around the amendment, so that they are also  on
board with regard to this particular issue. I was not aware that  there  was
this kind of problem; it was just out of  an  instinctive  feeling  that  it
would be important for both Houses to come together at the committee  level.


I agree with Mr Van Niekerk regarding his  concern  about  Mr  Raju  on  the
question of an additional budget, which has some financial implications  for
our current budget. But as the hon member knows, this is one  of  the  areas
beyond our control and, unfortunately, as we all know, our  budget  operates
within a system or a framework which wants work first.

One does not come up with one's future or one's dreams. One has  to  outline
exactly on what one is going to spend the money. As we  were  going  through
the budget process, unfortunately we could not justify why  we  had  to  get
more money. But we hope we will manage to create a regulator which  will  be
effective  and  be  able  to  deliver  without  any  financial  problems  or
constraints impacting on its performance. We hope we will manage that  quite
well.

Regarding Mr Kolweni's comments, I agree with him on  the  question  of  the
language. It is one of the issues on which we might have  to  create  public
awareness amongst our people. Coming from the township as I do, I know  that
in the past when one talked about gas, one meant electricity, coming from  a
power station. Regarding these kinds of  issues  I  agree  with  Mr  Kolweni
fully.

In order for our people to be involved in our communities, we   really  have
to make an effort, and I think all of us have a responsibility in  educating
our communities in ensuring that they  understand  the  differences  between
electricity and gas, as we call it  ezilalini  [in  the  villages.  Although
they use it in the townships, they do not call it gas, but we  call  it  gas
in the villages.

It is our task to make sure that entering the gas industry  and  markets  is
successful, and that our people understand it in a much better way. We  have
to educate them so as to show them the difference, and we must  also  go  to
the extent of addressing the needs of our people, as we have indicated.  Not
only should we do that,  but  we  must  also  be  able  to  reflect  on  the
differential  cost-effectiveness  of  the  gas  industry  and  the  ultimate
objective of the Government.

I think if all members take part in this process we will be able to  educate
our people and the gas industry will be a success. I  think  our  vision  of
gas as the energy of the 21st century will be realised and become a  reality
through our involvement and our commitment to our communities.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the constitution.

                  DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITIES AND PRIVILEGES BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN  AFFAIRS:  Chairperson  ...  [Interjections.]
She is heckling, Chairperson. Protect me.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I will.

The DEPUTY MINISTER:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  with  the  birth  of  our
democracy  in  1994,  there  has  been  an  impressive   increase   in   our
international relations, both with other countries  and  with  international
multilateral institutions, including the United  Nations  and  its  numerous
specialised agencies. Today we have 110 diplomatic missions and 46  consular
offices  in  South  Africa.  In  addition,  18  offices   of   international
organisations and specialised agencies have been opened in South Africa.

With  such  an  extension  of  our  diplomatic  relations  with  states  and
organisations alike, it soon became clear  that  the  Diplomatic  Immunities
and Privileges Act of 1989 was totally inadequate and outdated.

As  members  are  well  aware,  South  Africa   also   hosts   international
conferences and meetings more frequently than  ever  before.  Several  major
conferences, including the UN's  conferences,  have  taken  place  in  South
Africa since our return to the international community in 1994.

These include Unctad, the NAM Summit, the Commonwealth heads  of  government
meeting and, more recently, the World Conference against  Racism,  and  next
year we will host the World Summit on Sustainable Development.

All of these conferences, which were  attended  by  thousands  of  delegates
from abroad,  required  conferment  of  immunities  and  privileges  on  the
participants. This is an aspect that was not provided for  in  the  existing
Act, and much to the frustration of  many  international  organisations,  we
were forced to follow time-consuming administrative processes to be able  to
confer specific immunities and  privileges  on  the  participants  of  these
meetings. In this regard, the Act was in dire need of change.

The present Act  was  also  found  to  be  noncompliant  with  many  of  our
international obligations. As is known, South Africa is a party to  the  two
Vienna  conventions  to  this  issue.  However,   the   present   Diplomatic
Immunities and Privileges Act incorporates only some of  the  provisions  of
the Vienna conventions as part of South African law.

Recently  Parliament  approved  South  Africa's  accession   to   the   1946
Convention on  the  Privileges  and  Immunities  of  the  UN  and  the  1947
Convention on Privileges and Immunities  of  the  Specialised  Agencies.  In
terms of these conventions, South Africa is party thereto and is  under  the
obligation to  take  the  necessary  steps  to  give  legal  effect  to  the
provisions thereof.

One of the major shortcomings of the present Act is the  ad  hoc  manner  in
which  the  granting  of  immunities   and   privileges   to   international
organisations and specialised agencies has been done. The  ad  hoc  approach
gives rise to a situation in which not all international  organisations  are
treated in the same manner.

The lack of uniformity in treatment makes the administration and  regulation
of international organisations and  specialised  agencies  in  South  Africa
very problematic and, therefore, urgent attention had to be given to this.

In line with all of this, it became necessary to bring the Act in line  with
South Africa's international obligations under these conventions. It  became
clear that the present Act had  to  be  repealed  and  be  replaced  by  the
proposed Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges Act of 2001.

We have done extensive research on the whole issue  of  granting  immunities
and privileges in other countries. We have  had  extensive  discussions  and
consultations with other national departments. They have all supported  this
Bill.

It is clear that we will achieve four major  objectives  through  this  Bill
which will finally place South Africa on a par  with  other  countries  that
conduct their international relations in line  with  accepted  international
rules and practices.

The  Bill  will  give  effect  to  South  Africa's  existing   international
obligations, synchronise the ad hoc practices that exist at present when  it
comes to the regularisation  of  international  organisations  and,  lastly,
lessen the time consumed in administrative processes that  currently  hamper
the effectiveness of the administration of immunities and privileges.

In conclusion, it is our  contention  that  the  Diplomatic  Immunities  and
Privileges Bill of 2001 that we  are  discussing  here  today  will  finally
place South Africa  in  line  with  international  practice  concerning  the
granting of immunities and privileges to diplomatic  and  consular  missions
and their members,  to  the  UN  and  specialised  agencies,  and  to  other
international organisations.

Through  this  Bill  South  Africa  will  also  have   complied   with   its
international obligations under the various  conventions  to  which  we  are
party and prescribed the way in which immunities and privileges  are  to  be
conferred on the various subjects of international law.

We wish to thank the NA and NCOP, as well the relevant portfolio  committees
that gave such attention to this Act and made very important  changes  which
enabled us to present a final Bill which is far better than the first  draft
that we presented. [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, if the hon Moosa agrees not to use all  his
speaking time, I am prepared  just  to  say  that  we  agree  to  the  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, I was going  to  read  the  whole  Bill  for  the
Chair. It is 65 pages long, and I hope the Chair will bear with  me.  No,  I
was not going to take long either. I think  that  the  Deputy  Minister  has
very extensively covered all the content that was required to be covered  in
respect of the speech that I had written down and prepared to read out  here
today.

However, I just need to say  a  few  things.  Firstly,  I  think  that  with
legislation like this we have clearly made a statement both  to  the  people
in  our  country  and  to  people  all  over  the  world.  When  one  passes
legislation like this, then one knows that that  has  happened,  that  South
Africa has arrived. That is really what legislation like this is all  about.


What this Bill does is that it puts in place  a  world-class  law,  I  think
probably one of the best in the world at the moment: a world-class piece  of
legislation that affords all the privileges and immunities for  any  foreign
person who comes here to be constructive and on  friendly  terms  to  enjoy.
For people who come here and commit crimes it is really tough. But  what  we
have done is put together a law here that says: Feel free  in  our  country.
Feel free to come here and participate and engage in the  processes  of  our
country and the world, because we recognise the  rights  and  immunities  of
all citizens and countries of the  world  when  they  come  and  participate
here.

It is very important that we do these kinds of things because, for  example,
the Earth Summit next year - I address this to Mr Ackermann -  is  going  to
be the largest conference ever held in history, anywhere in  the  world.  It
is going to be held in Johannesburg in September 2002.  This  conference  is
going to attract 60 000 to 70 000 delegates, journalists,  protestors,  NGOs
and all sorts of people into one province; between 60 000 and 70 000  people
over 10 days. It has never happened anywhere else in the world, and we  have
to protect those people who come to our  country  to  participate  in  these
conferences.

We have friendly organisations  such  as  the  United  Nations,  and  others
operating at all levels, whether  health,  education,  trade  or  economics.
There  is  the  World  Trade  Organisation,   and   there   are   diplomats,
ambassadors, consuls and consul-generals and so forth. We  protect  them  in
this country and we want them to know clearly that we protect them and  they
have the immunities that they deserve when they come to this country.

We also know, regarding many  of  the  countries  whose  representatives  we
protect here, that we  receive  the  same  protection  in  those  countries,
because we have diplomats in those countries. We have missions all over  the
world. We have economic and political missions in every corner of the  world
and we receive those protections and we afford them the same protections  in
this country. With those few words I want to ask the House  to  support  the
Bill.
I just want to bring one little matter to  the  attention  of  the  hon  the
Deputy Minister. [Interjections.] There is a  definition  in  this  Bill  of
``member of a family''. If he has seen  this  definition  he  will  be  very
worried, because he knows that the Indian community  is  very  big.  If  one
includes all relatives, as the  Bill  does  by  saying  that  ``  any  other
unmarried child or other family member officially recognised as a  dependent
member of the family'' may  be  given  diplomatic  immunity  here,  one  can
imagine what big families the Indians will bring here  when  they  come.  He
knows what I am talking about, when I talk about an extended family.

I was just hoping that he would take care of that particular clause and  put
some regulations in place, so that we clearly understand what we  mean  when
we refer to other members of the family, it could  be  600  people  whom  we
have to give diplomatic immunity to.  But  that  is  the  only  problem  and
concern we have with this Bill. Otherwise we think it is  a  fantastic  Bill
and we really support it and we ask the House to vote for it. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC AFFAIRS - COTONOU
                            PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, the Deputy Minister of Finance is going  to  take
my salary away if I do not act fast. This Cotonou  agreement  is  about  100
pages long. It relates to a whole range of co-operation:  economic,  social,
political and capacity-building co-operation between the European  Community
countries and the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

It is a very good agreement. One will not be able to explain it in  the  two
minutes that I have been given, so  I  simply  want  to  ask  the  House  to
endorse it. It is one  of  those  many  international  agreements  that  are
opening  up  markets  and  resources  internationally,  and  are  making  it
possible for South Africa to do the kinds of things  we  do,  to  serve  our
people, to alleviate poverty and to generate wealth  in  this  part  of  the
world. So I want  to  ask  the  House  to  support  the  Cotonou  agreement.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Report adopted in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE CENTRE BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  the  Financial
Intelligence Centre Bill is placed before this House today so  that  it  may
consider the  introduction  of  an  extensive  anti-money-laundering  regime
through our legislation. The  Financial  Intelligence  Centre  Bill  is  the
result of a thorough process of discussion, research and drafting  over  the
past four years. What we have before us, we believe, compares with the  best
and most comprehensive anti-money laundering  legislation  anywhere  in  the
world.

The Bill is the product of a comprehensive  process  involving  the  SA  Law
Commission, a task team appointed by the  Ministry  of  Finance,  all  major
stakeholders  in  South  Africa,  and  international  bodies  such  as   the
Financial Action Task Force, the Commonwealth Secretariat, the  UK  National
Criminal Intelligence Services, the US Department  of  Justice  and  the  US
Treasury,  Australia's  Financial  Intelligence  Unit  and  the   Australian
Transaction  Reports  and  Analysis  Centre.  Accordingly,  the  Bill  draws
extensively on international best  practice,  and  provides  our  Government
with the tools to play an important role in combating all manner  of  money-
laundering activities.

This Bill complements the Prevention  of  Organised  Crime  Act,  which  was
adopted by Parliament in  1998.  The  Poca,  as  we  call  it,  specifically
criminalised money laundering and required  suspicious  transactions  to  be
reported to the Commercial Crime Branch of the SAPS.
But Poca fell short in so far as it did not establish a dedicated  financial
intelligence unit to interpret those reports or to monitor  compliance  with
those reporting obligations. Nor did it  impose  the  relevant  ``know  your
client'' training and record-keeping obligations on those sectors which  are
believed to be the most susceptible to money laundering. These  deficiencies
are rectified by the Financial Intelligence Centre Bill.

As defined in the Bill, ``money laundering'' means  an  activity  which  has
the effect of converting the proceeds of unlawful  activity,  of  disguising
the nature  and  source  of  this  hot  money  and  the  ownership  thereof.
Typically, the laundering process is broken down into three  phases:  first,
placement - when the illegal or dirty money is  placed  into  the  financial
system; second, layering - when the  criminal  tries  to  obscure  the  link
between the funds and the illegal  activity  through  a  number  of  complex
transactions to obscure its true origin; and third, integration -  when  the
funds are reintegrated into the financial sector again, so that  it  appears
to be legitimate or clean money, and in so doing, it ends up as  profit  for
the criminal.

After the funds  have  been  cleaned,  the  criminal  often  moves  the  now
legitimate funds into  mainstream  economic  activities,  such  as  business
investments, real estate or luxury goods. They normally buy  very  expensive
things for cash.

However, money laundering and the legislation introduced  today  take  on  a
new meaning in the wake of the post-September 11 attacks on the US  and  the
events unfolding in the Middle East.  No  longer  can  money  laundering  be
understood only as hiding and moving the proceeds of unlawful activity  such
as drug trafficking. It must include those  funds  which  are  intended  for
terrorist activity as well.

The problem with money laundering is that it has a  corrosive  effect  on  a
country's economy, its government and  its  social  wellbeing.  It  distorts
business  decisions,  increases  the  risk  of  bank  failures  and  creates
liquidity problems in financial markets.  Due  to  the  quick  flow  of  hot
money, it takes control  of  economic  policy  away  from  government,  thus
making sound policy decisions difficult to achieve.  It  harms  a  country's
reputation, and exposes its people to crime  syndicates,  drug  trafficking,
smuggling and other criminal activity.

Due to increased activities  by  authorities  in  developed  nations,  crime
syndicates  are  shifting  their  activities  to  less  regulated   emerging
markets,  especially  those  that  are  in  the  process   of   opening   or
liberalising their own markets.

The cumulative  effect  of  laundering  activities  is  to  destabilise  the
foundations of a nation's financial system. Money laundering diminishes  the
tax revenue to the fiscus and thereby indirectly harms honest taxpayers.  It
makes government's tax collection procedures more  difficult.  The  loss  of
untaxed revenue generally means higher tax rates  for  law-abiding  citizens
and corporates than would be the case if the untaxed proceeds of crime  were
legitimate.

Therefore, with  this  Bill  we  intend  to  interrupt  the  cycle  used  by
organised criminal groups to benefit from  illegitimate  profits.  We  shall
use the Bill to maintain  the  integrity  of  the  South  African  financial
system, which we have struggled so hard to build.

The object of the Bill is to introduce  mechanisms  and  measures  aimed  at
preventing and combating money-laundering activities. It sets  up  an  anti-
money-laundering regime which  encourages  voluntary  compliance  and  self-
regulation by institutions which  otherwise  may  be  exploited  for  money-
laundering purposes. To this extent, the Bill  complements  and  works  with
the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, as I said earlier on.

The Bill  establishes  a  Financial  Intelligence  Centre,  which  will  co-
ordinate  policy  and  Government's  efforts  to  counter   money-laundering
activities. The centre will be  located  outside  the  Public  Service,  but
within  the  public  administration  in  terms  of  section   195   of   the
Constitution. It will be accountable to the hon the Minister of Finance  and
will be funded directly from the national Budget.

The centre will bring together all  financial  intelligence  data  into  one
single repository for analysis, before passing this information  on  to  the
law-enforcement agencies for  further  investigation  and  prosecution.  The
Financial  Intelligence  Centre   is   being   established   for   financial
intelligence  gathering  and  analysis.  It  will   receive   reports   from
accountable institutions. It will then process, analyse  and  interpret  the
data before passing this information on to the  law-enforcement  authorities
who, in  turn,  will  use  it  for  further  investigation,  and  ultimately
prosecution. The centre itself  will  not  be  an  investigative  body.  The
function of investigating  suspected  criminal  activity  will  remain  with
those authorities who are tasked with this function under the Constitution.

The centre  will  be  headed  by  an  appropriately  qualified  director.  A
relatively small staff complement is intended, which will be made  up  of  a
full-time  core,  with  others  drawn  by  way  of  secondment  from   other
Government departments such as the Police Service, the National  Prosecuting
Authority and the SA Revenue Service. Others will  be  recruited  for  their
specialised skills, such as their proven  ability  for  analysing  financial
data and forensic work, or for their legal and investigative skills.

The Bill also creates new legal  categories  of  accountable  and  reporting
institutions, which refer to the companies and businesses we consider to  be
most vulnerable to money-laundering activities. These  include  banks,  life
assurance companies, foreign exchange  dealers,  casinos,  and  even  estate
agents. They will be required to implement internal  administrative  systems
to ensure that they know their  customers,  report  suspicious  and  certain
cash transactions, keep records of  their  customers  and  the  transactions
that  they  were  involved  in,  appoint  compliance  officers,  and   train
employees to comply with the provisions of this Bill.

The battle against organised crime and money laundering  cannot  be  won  by
Government and public bodies alone. To be  effective,  anti-money-laundering
policy requires a partnership between Government, the  private  sector,  and
supervisory and regulatory bodies which operate  in  the  financial  sector.
This partnership is given practical  expression  in  the  Bill  through  the
establishment of a  Money-Laundering  Advisory  Council.  The  council  will
facilitate public-private co-operation and will advise  on  the  development
of appropriate anti-money-laundering policies.  Although  the  council  will
not have any executive or regulatory powers, it will be  necessary  for  the
hon the Minister to consult with the council before issuing  regulations  or
exempting  any  accountable  institutions  from  the  provisions   of   this
legislation.

Schedule 2 of the Bill provides a list of supervisory bodies, which  include
the Financial Services Board, the Reserve Bank, the Registrar of  Companies,
the Estate Agents Board, the Public  Accountants  and  Auditors  Board,  the
National  Gambling  Board,  the  Johannesburg  Stock   Exchange   Securities
Exchange, and the Law Society of South Africa. Each  supervisory  body  will
be responsible  for  supervising  compliance  by  accountable  institutions,
which fall within their jurisdiction, with  the  provisions  of  this  Bill.
They must investigate referred acts of transgression and may take  steps  to
remedy the matter. In the event of the  supervisory  body  not  taking  such
steps, the Financial Intelligence Centre can take  appropriate  measures  to
do so.

Central to the proper functioning of the Financial Intelligence Centre  will
be the information technology system that it utilises. This will enable  the
Financial  Intelligence  Centre  to   receive   reports   from   accountable
institutions and develop databases of stored information.

Over time, large volumes  of  data  will  need  to  be  sifted  through  and
analysed for names, links and networking  patterns.  This  information  will
then be fed through to the investigative agencies  for  them  to  carry  out
further work. These information  technology  systems  will  require  careful
scoping in the months ahead.

However, we will want to avoid reinventing the wheel by spending  hugely  on
development costs when proven software has already been developed  for  this
kind of work. Therefore, the National  Treasury  is  already  in  discussion
with other financial intelligence units in this regard.

The Treasury has assembled a regulations drafting team which has  the  brief
of providing the final details to this Bill. We  also  intend  drafting  the
regulations in the sequence that we expect the legislation  to  be  enacted.
Therefore,  those  regulations  dealing  with  customer  identification  and
record-keeping requirements will be prepared  first  and  then  followed  by
requirements for reporting information.

This Bill makes it possible for these regulations  to  be  implemented  only
after  consultation  with  the  centre  and  the  Money-Laundering  Advisory
Council. Therefore,  these  two  bodies  will  be  established  as  soon  as
possible. It is anticipated that the first phase  will  be  from  June  next
year, when banks will be  required  to  know  their  clients  and  to  start
reporting suspicious and unusual transactions. Full implementation  will  be
completed three years hence, once electronic transaction reporting from  all
accountable and reporting institutions has been phased in.

Chapter 5 of the Bill identifies  a  range  of  offences  and  imposes  very
onerous  penalties  in  the   event   of   transgressions   by   accountable
institutions. Thus, a person found  guilty  of  any  of  these  offences  is
liable to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 15 years  or  a  fine  not
exceeding R10 million. The Bill sends out a very clear message that  we  are
serious about implementing an anti-money-laundering regime in this country.

The  anti-money-laundering  regime   brought   about   by   this   Bill   is
substantially in compliance with the  40  recommendations  set  out  by  the
Financial Action Task Force on  Money-Laundering,  which  is  the  de  facto
international co-ordinating body  for  anti-money-laundering  practices.  In
this regard, South Africa will seek a close working  relationship  with  and
an affiliation to the task force.

The centre will also liaise  closely  and  share  information  with  the  55
counterpart financial intelligence units elsewhere in the  world.  We  shall
also seek to work closely with  and  support  countries  in  the  region  to
ensure that anti-money-laundering co-ordination in the region can be at  its
highest.

The legislation before hon members today is amongst the  most  comprehensive
anti-money-laundering  legislation  anywhere  in  the  world.  It  draws  on
international best practice and gives South Africa the means to  combat  all
manner of money-laundering activity. We are serious about identifying  those
who are involved in this activity and bringing them to book. [Applause.]

Ms  Q  D  MAHLANGU:  Chairperson,  the  Deputy  Minister  has   dealt   very
extensively with the contents of the Bill. I  am  not  going  to  waste  hon
members' time by going through those details again.
When the committee was being briefed about  the  Bill,  one  of  the  things
mentioned was a detailed implementation plan which has  been  championed  by
the National Treasury.  I  am  going  to  talk  about  those  implementation
issues. We need to move with speed to ensure that  institutional  mechanisms
for an effective anti-money-laundering regime are in place, and critical  to
these mechanisms will be co-operation between law-enforcement agencies.

The experience of the United Kingdom  and  that  of  the  United  States  of
America show that without that co-operation, co-ordination  and  sharing  of
information, the centre will become ineffective. That is very important.

For example, it took the United States of America  seven  years  to  achieve
full co-operation between its law-enforcement agencies. In  our  country  it
is vital that we ensure that these institutions  are  co-operating  and  co-
ordinating.

The supervisory  board,  as  an  accountable  institution,  must  begin  the
process  of  putting  in  place  a  compliance  mechanism,   including   the
appointment of compliance officers, and the education  of  their  employees,
recognising that these employees are at the  coalface  of  transactions  and
must  therefore  be  enabled  to  recognise  the  unusual   and   suspicious
transactions that the Deputy Minister has talked about.

Lastly, there are a few other issues that I want to  talk  about.  According
to the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement that was tabled last week by  the
Minister of Finance,  the  Financial  Intelligence  Centre  is  one  of  the
Government's priorities for the 2002 budget. Its aim is  to  assist  in  the
global efforts to combat money-laundering.

I want to commend the department and the  National  Treasury.  Even  at  the
stage of piloting the legislation through  Parliament,  the  department  has
already started the implementation plan. During the briefing  we  were  told
how this Bill is going to be implemented.

We are looking forward to the appropriation of funds to start  this  centre.
We request Treasury  to  keep  Parliament  abreast  with  the  progress  and
difficulties during the implementation process of this Bill.

May I call upon members of this august House to  support  the  Bill  without
amendments, as the select committee requested. [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I did hear ``the honourable'', but  it  was
very faint.

Opbrengs  uit  onwettige  en  misdadige  aktiwiteite  word  wêreldwyd   deur
misdaadsindikate aangewend om verdere  misdaadaktiwiteite  te  finansier  en
sodoende die bose kringloop voort te sit.

Ten einde die oorsprong van hul  geld  te  verdoesel,  maak  misdadigers  en
misdaadsindikate gebruik van 'n stelsel wat  as  geldwassery  bekend  staan.
Onwettig  verkreë  geld  word  nie  deur  die  algemeen  erkende  finansiële
instellings gekanaliseer nie, maar word op  onwettige  wyse  in  kontantvorm
omgeskep.
Suid-Afrika het nie die euwel vrygespring nie en  het  dié  wetsontwerp  nou
baie dringend nodig. Die doel  van  die  wetsontwerp  is  die  skep  van  'n
finansiële intelligensiesentrum wat daarop gerig is om  die  opbrengste  uit
onwettige en misdadige bedrywighede en  ander  agterdogwekkende  transaksies
te identifiseer en om die verdoeseling van sodanig verkreë geld deur  middel
van geldwassery te bestry.

Dit is 'n hoogs tegniese en komplekse wetsontwerp wat in die  Huis  aan  die
ander kant met behulp van  die  portefeuljekomitee  op  justisie  deurgetrap
moes word, 'n proses waartydens  'n  groot  hoeveelheid  wysigings  aan  die
oorspronklike konsep aangebring moes word.

Aangesien geldwassery internasionaal 'n hoogs gesofistikeerde bedryf  geword
het, moes ons in Suid-Afrika ook  daartoe  oorgaan  om  van  gesofistikeerde
stelsels  gebruik  te  maak.  Alleenlik  op   dié   manier   kan   plaaslike
georganiseerde misdaad se suurstof afgesluit word.

Die Finansiële Intelligensiesentrum sal onder meer verantwoordelik wees  vir
die insameling van inligting vanaf alle finansiële instellings in beide  die
openbare en die private  sektor  waar  groot  kontantbedrae  in  transaksies
gebruik word, waar elektroniese oordragte na en van  Suid-Afrika  gemaak  en
waar  agterdogwekkende  transaksies  beklink  word.  Dit  sal  kragtens  dié
wetsontwerp die plig van sodanige instellings wees om dit onverwyld aan  die
FIS te rapporteer.

Die agb Minister het verwys na die boetes van R10 miljoen en die  tronkstraf
van 15 jaar, wat net daarop dui hoe belangrik dit  is  dat  hierdie  misdade
vasgevat moet word, en dat daar ernstig daaroor  besin  is.  Die  Finansiële
Intelligensie Sentrum, FIS, word gefinansier deur die  fondse  wat  jaarliks
deur die Parlement toegewys word, deur enige verdere  toekennings  wat  deur
die Regering aan hom gemaak mag word, en deur  enige  ander  fondse  wat  hy
wettiglik mag verkry. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Proceeds of illegal and criminal activities are used throughout  the  world
by crime syndicates to finance further criminal activities and in  so  doing
perpetuate the vicious circle.

In order to cover  up  the  source  of  their  money,  criminals  and  crime
syndicates use a  system  that  is  known  as  money  laundering.  Illegally
acquired  money  is  not  channelled  through  the  generally   acknowledged
financial institutions, but is illegally changed into cash.

South Africa has not escaped this evil and this Bill is now  a  very  urgent
necessity. The objective of the Bill is to create a  Financial  Intelligence
Centre aimed at identifying the proceeds of illegal and criminal  activities
and other suspicious transactions and to combat the  covering  up  of  money
obtained by those means through laundering it.

This is a highly technical and complex Bill that had to be thrashed  out  in
the House on the other side with the assistance  of  the  justice  portfolio
committee, a process during which a large number of  amendments  had  to  be
made to the original draft.

Since  money  laundering  has  become  a   highly   sophisticated   industry
internationally,  we  in  South  Africa  also  had  to  go  over  to   using
sophisticated systems. In this way alone can the oxygen of local,  organised
crime be shut off.

The Financial Intelligence Centre  will  be  responsible,  inter  alia,  for
collecting information from all financial institutions in  both  the  public
and  the  private  sectors  where  large  amounts  of  cash  are   used   in
transactions, where electronic transfers are made to and from  South  Africa
and where suspicious transactions take place. In terms of this Bill it  will
be the duty of such institutions to report it to the FIC immediately.

The hon the Minister made reference to the  fine  of  R10  million  and  the
prison sentence of 15 years, which indicate just how important  it  is  that
these  crimes  should  be  combated,  and  that  this  was   given   serious
consideration. The Financial Intelligence Centre, FIC, is financed with  the
funds  that  are  allocated  by  Parliament  annually,  with   any   further
allocations that may be made to it by the Government,  and  with  any  other
funds that it may acquire legally.]

I take for granted that this does not include hot money at all.

Die Auditeur-generaal sal ook jaarliks oor die  FIS  se  finansiële  rekords
verslag doen. Ons is tevrede om hierdie wetsontwerp te steun. [The  Auditor-
General will also report annually on the financial records of  the  FIC.  We
are happy to support this Bill.]

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson and hon Deputy Minister, the Bill  before  us  is
complex, but we want to commend the Ministry  and  the  department  on  this
piece of legislation. The official  opposition  will  support  the  Bill  as
amended.

The Bill establishes a Financial Intelligence Centre and a  Money-Laundering
Advisory Council which will assist in  the  identification  of  proceeds  of
unlawful activities and the combating of  money-laundering  activities.  The
method  of  operation  will  be  to  work  with  accountable   institutions,
supervisory bodies and reporting institutions to report unlawful  activities
and money-laundering.

I want to turn to the objectives and functions of the  Bill.  The  principle
objective of the  centre  is  to  assist  with  the  identification  of  the
proceeds of unlawful activities  and  the  combating  of  money  laundering.
Furthermore, it is to make information collected available to  investigation
authorities to facilitate the administration and enforcement of the laws  of
the Republic and to  exchange  information  with  similar  bodies  in  other
countries on money laundering and similar offences.

To achieve these objectives, the centre must process, analyse and  interpret
information, inform, advise and co-operate with  investigation  authorities,
monitor and  give  guidance  to  accountable  institutions  and  supervisory
bodies and retain information for the period required in the Act.

It is clear from the mentioned objectives  and  functions  that  law-abiding
citizens will subscribe to and abide by these. The centre  will  thus  carry
out its main activities  by  gathering  information  from  the  private  and
public sectors and  disseminate  it  to  the  appropriate  law-  enforcement
agencies.

The staff of the centre will obviously be selected very carefully to  enable
them to meet these sets of objectives. The staff of the centre will also  be
carefully screened for security purposes  and  will  have  a  high  security
clearance. The centre and the advisory council will  be  financed  by  money
appropriated by Parliament  annually  and  by  grants  made  to  it  by  the
Government. Parliament will thus have an oversight role and see to  it  that
the money is well spent and that  taxpayers  are  getting  value  for  their
money.

On  the  money-laundering  control  measures,  the  Bill  places   a   heavy
responsibility on  the  various  accountable  institutions  such  as  banks,
foreign exchange dealers and stock  exchanges.  It  requires  them  to  know
their clients and report all suspicious and unusual transactions.  The  onus
is thus placed on the accountable institutions to  identify  suspicious  and
unusual transactions.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on a point of order: Can we  just  get  the
official opposition's name under the picture  of  the  hon  member  speaking
now. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, there was nothing  out  of
order in your speech. Those are logistics which we will deal  with  here  at
the Table. Please proceed, hon member.

Mr J L THERON: Thank you, Chairperson. I do not think  it  is  necessary  to
respond to that.

On the offences and penalties, money laundering is  a  serious  and  growing
problem internationally involving sums amounting to hundreds of millions  of
US$ each year. South Africa is  no  exception.  An  accountable  institution
which fails to identify persons, fails to  keep  records,  fails  to  report
suspicious and unusual transactions, fails to send reports, fails to  comply
with requests from  the  centre  or  misuses  information  will  face  heavy
penalties. The Bill provides for severe penalties: up to  15  years  or  R10
million, as mentioned previously, for offences committed.

Like the  taxation  legislation,  it  provides  for  abnormal  invasions  of
privacy in respect of financial dealings.

In conclusion, as the Bill is complex tens of hours were spent in the  joint
finance and justice portfolio committee  meetings  and  a  large  number  of
amendments have been made to the Bill, which was  tabled.  Nevertheless,  it
has the support of the financial services industry and  of  all  parties  in
the committee. We therefore support the Bill as amended. [Applause.]

Mr T B TAABE: Madam Chairperson, it is my pleasure  once  again  to  address
this House, the occasion being the passing  of  the  Financial  Intelligence
Centre Bill in this Chamber this afternoon. There have been references  from
certain members in this House - I  do  not  know  if  these  references  are
parliamentary - one reference being to the effect that I should be called  a
cowboy, a reference by the hon member  Raju  from  the  wounded  opposition.
[Laughter.]

On a much more serious note, I thought I needed  to  outline  what  the  key
objective of this Bill is, which objective basically is an  attempt  on  the
part of all of us to combat money-laundering activities in our economy.

I thought I was also going to take  the  opportunity  to  explain  in  quite
succinct terms what is understood by money  laundering.  But  the  task  has
been made much easier by the hon the Deputy Minister. So, I will not  really
dwell much on that, except to say that hon members should  be  accorded  the
opportunity to assist those,  like  the  hon  member  Raju,  who  might  not
necessarily understand this concept of money laundering and those  who  find
it quite technical. Money-laundering, in the most simple of layman's  terms,
in the language of the hoi poloi, refers to disguising dirty money  to  make
it appear legitimate. I am sure the hon member Raju has benefited from  this
most simple of explanations of the concept. [Laughter.]

The House probably  knows  that  money,  particularly  in  liquid  form,  is
extremely  mobile  and   convertible.   With   the   advent   of   financial
liberalisation and information technology in the age of  globalisation,  new
avenues are created for money-laundering activities in the economy. And,  as
such, criminals have taken advantage of these  new  scenarios  in  order  to
hide the origins of their illegal earnings.

The  point  has  to  be  made  that  when  an  illegal  activity   generates
substantial profit, the individual or group must find a way to  control  the
funds, without attracting attention to the underlying  activity  or  persons
involved. Perpetrators of these illegal activities  do  this  by  disguising
their sources, and then changing  their  form  or  moving  the  funds  to  a
location  where  they  do  not  attract  attention.  The  result  of   these
transactions  is  that  laundered  money  becomes   indistinguishable   from
legitimate money.

If control over access to the financial  system  is  strong,  the  financial
system will not be an attraction to the money  launderer.  Accepting  bribes
becomes  much  more  difficult   if   anti-money-laundering   measures   are
instituted. The presence of large-scale and  ubiquitous  illegal  syndicates
has a corrupting influence on governments,  especially  on  law  enforcement
and border control officers. Our experience in South Africa best attests  to
this reality. Moreover, this also gives rise  to  the  perpetual  growth  of
illegal business and reduces the potential growth of legitimate business.

This  vicious  cycle  of  growth  in   illegal   syndicates   is   therefore
perpetuated.  Although  money-laundering  is,  by  its   very   nature,   an
underground activity, rough estimates are provided to give a  sense  of  the
scale of the problem.

The  IMF,  for  example,  has  stated  that  the  aggregate  size  of  money
laundering in the world could be somewhere between 2% and 5% of the  world's
GDP. Using the 1996 statistics this would  be  between  US$590  billion  and
US$1,5 trillion. The lower figure is probably equal  to  the  economy  of  a
country as big as Spain. There is also evidence to suggest that  the  impact
of money laundering is  so  large  that  macroeconomic  policy-makers,  like
ourselves, must give it serious consideration.

The Deputy Minister made reference earlier on in  his  own  words  to  money
laundering having a corrosive effect on the economy,  and  much  detail  was
given in this regard.

As a member of this committee  on  finance,  I  am  keen  to  refer  to  the
relationship between the macroeconomy  and  money  laundering.  It  is  well
documented in terms of what economists and financial analysts have  said  in
relation to how money-laundering could distort economic data,  macroeconomic
analysis and policy-making.

The  following  are  some  potential  macroeconomic  consequences  of  money
laundering,  such  as  inexplicable  changes  in  money  demand;  additional
pressure on inflation; inexplicable changes in  asset  prices  and  interest
rates;  effects  on  savings  resulting  from  induced  changes  in   income
distribution; greater prudential  risks  to  bank  soundness;  contamination
affects   on   legal-financial   transactions;   greater    volatility    of
international capital flows; greater volatility of exchange rates  owing  to
unanticipated gross cross-border  asset  transfers;  a  rapid  reduction  in
foreign exchange reserves;  and  the  erosion  of  confidence  in  financial
markets.

The opportunity to launder money could promote private economic welfare  for
some; while monumentally undermining social welfare in any  economy.  Public
policy  considerations,  therefore,  suggest  an  antilaundering  role   for
financial  institutions  involved   in   prudential   banking   supervision,
financial statistical reporting by the business and banking  community,  and
the installation of appropriate legislation by governments.

In  this  light,  clause  2  of  the  Bill  proposes   quite   clearly   the
establishment of an institution to be known as  the  Financial  Intelligence
Centre. The details were made available in this House by previous  speakers.
The objectives, again, I  think  the  hon  the  Deputy  Minister  and  other
members have dealt with in terms of what this centre is going to be doing.

I think I must also mention that greater care should be taken  in  designing
the form of interventions that may be necessary by Government, from time  to
time,  against  money-laundering  practices   to   minimise   the   negative
consequences for macroeconomic  efficiency.  Anti-money  laundering  reforms
can be effective only when both the  international  community  and  domestic
leaders agree and support reforms. If these  reforms  are  not  implemented,
both corruption and money laundering will  continue  regardless  of  actions
directly aimed at curtailing them.
Our democratic Government has obviously  displayed  an  honest  and  visible
commitment to fighting money laundering, organised crime and  corruption.  I
think there cannot be an iota of doubt, I am sure on the part of members  of
this House, in terms of agreeing with us that ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member,  your  speaking  time  has
expired.

Mr T B  TAABE:  Chairperson,  this  legislation  demonstrates  the  tangible
commitment on the side of Government to ensuring that, indeed, we  are  able
to flush out these hyenas who are criminals, basically,  from  the  face  of
the earth in this country.

In conclusion, Madam Chair, it is ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time is up. [Laughter.]

Mr T B TAABE: It is heartening to note  that  members  in  this  House  have
actually supported the passing of this Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, let me thank  all  the  members
who have participated in the debate. Like the hon Taabe, I would  also  like
to acknowledge the fact that all the parties have supported this Bill.

I would like, perhaps, to make just one or two points. Firstly,  I  am  glad
that the hon Taabe elaborated  on  the  possible  macroeconomic  effects  of
money laundering. If one is to have  a  financial  system  which  is  highly
infiltrated by these kinds of funds, then one is likely to have some of  the
effects that the hon member has referred to. I think the whole issue  really
concerns the role of money in society, in our lives and in  everything  that
happens, whether it is trade or whatever. I think it is good  that  the  hon
member has actually highlighted the issue of the  macroeconomic  effects  of
money laundering.

The issue of protecting the integrity of our financial system is  of  utmost
importance. I must say, in this regard, that there are initiatives  that  we
are engaged in, not just in relation to money laundering  but  generally  to
try to establish in the Southern African  region  an  environment  of  sound
financial institutions and services. In this particular regard, we are  also
going to be co-operating with other countries in the  region  to  make  sure
that there is in the region this kind of environment. A lot of  things  that
we do are not as beneficial if right next door to us the  very  opposite  of
what we are doing is taking place. The  issue  is  that  we  should  take  a
regional approach so that we can ensure that we  establish  a  region  which
has certain features: no money laundering takes  place  here,  inflation  is
low, interest rates are low and financial institutions are sound. These  are
some of the things that we aspire to. There is a whole range of  initiatives
to try to ensure that we achieve those objectives.

Perhaps the final point that one needs to make is  that  the  regulation  of
financial institutions and  services,  historically,  has  tended  to  focus
either on individual participants or on institutions. But today the role  of
technology  is  such  that  there  is  much  greater  connectivity   between
services, institutions and  individuals.  So  regulation,  I  believe,  must
begin to take cognisance of the role of technology and  seek  to  understand
that role, so that our regulation can be properly tuned to  ensure  that  we
are also  able  to  use  technology  to  the  advantage  of  our  regulatory
objectives.

I think that the implementation of the Financial  Intelligence  Centre  Bill
is going to be a very interesting exercise, because it actually  brings  the
role of technology into the centre.  We  will  be  looking  forward  to  the
experience  of  putting  in  place  the  mechanisms   for   fighting   money
laundering.

There is another big project that we are going to be engaged in in the  next
year. This is the whole issue around  establishing  a  single  regulator  in
South Africa. There is a lot of fragmentation in our regulatory  environment
in South Africa. We have  made  a  policy  pronouncement  that  we  will  be
establishing a single regulator.

There are many reasons for this. One of them is  the  emergence  of  complex
organisations. For example, Old Mutual is involved  in  banking,  insurance,
asset management and all sorts of activities.

Therefore how does one regulate an entity like that, when  one's  regulatory
framework is as fragmented as ours is here in South Africa?  Those  are  the
two  big  projects  that  we  are  going  to  be  engaged   in,   that   is,
implementation of the Financial Intelligence Centre  and  the  establishment
of a single regulator. Let  me,  once  again,  thank  all  the  members  for
participating in the debate and supporting the legislation.

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                        PENSION FUNDS AMENDMENT BILL
                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, on behalf of  the  official  ruling  party  ...
[Laughter.] ... it is a pleasure for  me  to  introduce  the  Pension  Funds
Amendment Bill - B22B - 2001 - before the House, which  is  the  Bill  which
proposes to amend the Pension Funds Act of 1956.

Currently a registered pension fund may grant housing loans to its  members,
if the rules of the  funds  so  permit.  However,  the  Bill  of  the  House
proposes, among other  things,  that  in  addition  to  the  above-mentioned
scenario, the pension fund may provide a guarantee to  lending  institutions
such as banks or mutual banks which grant housing loans to  members  of  the
fund against the pledge of  the  members'  withdrawal  benefits.  This  will
allow members to enjoy favourable conditions of housing loans as  the  above
specialised institutions are usually  better  equipped  to  administer  such
loans.

Over and above that, the  Bill  will  contribute  towards  the  Government's
vision of housing for all, by extending the concept  of  home  ownership  to
include those people who previously could not  qualify  for  loans,  because
the properties for which they or their spouses obtained right of  occupation
or ownership were not under a lease agreement or registered  in  their  name
in their deeds office as required.

Also, the maximum 30-year period for  repayment  of  the  housing  loan,  as
proposed in the Bill, is subject to the condition  that  the  loan  may  not
exceed one third of the total value of the member's benefits  at  retirement
while providing for a situation of default by a member, thereby making  sure
that if retirement comes before full repayment of the loan, the member  will
not lose all his or her retirement benefits.

If one was born and raised in previously disadvantaged areas then one  would
appreciate the obstacles that people have to overcome in  their  efforts  to
try and access housing loans  from  the  established  banking  institutions,
because of their status and earning power. It is clear that the Bill,  as  a
piece of enabling legislation, will improve the situation  and  enable  more
people to access housing loans under reasonable  conditions  and  experience
the joy of becoming home owners  and,  with  that,  improved  conditions  of
living.

With these few words, I present the  amending  Bill  before  the  House  for
adoption.

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                   STOCK EXCHANGES CONTROL AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Our apologies,  members.  What  is  in
front of me is ``Mr J  L  Theron''.  Table  staff,  please  sort  this  out.
[Interjections.] Mr Raju, somebody on that side of the House says  you  have
been reinstated. [Laughter.]
Mr N M RAJU: Madam Chair, although I am a member of the official  opposition
under a powerful leader, this House will note that I do  not  intend  to  be
controversial. [Interjections.] [Laughter.] It is my pleasure  to  read  the
statement on behalf of  the  Select  Committee  on  Finance  with  the  full
concurrence of all committee members.

The Stock Exchanges Control Amendment Bill amends section 40  of  the  Stock
Exchanges Control Act of 1985. This Bill seeks to enable the stock  exchange
to  regulate  price  stabilising  mechanisms  in  its   rules   or   listing
requirements.

The proposed amendment to section 40 is of particular  interest  to  Telkom,
whose advisers have indicated to the Financial Services Board  that  at  the
time of Telkom's envisaged listing they will seek to implement some type  of
price stabilising measure in respect  of  Telkom's  shares  on  the  day  of
listing and thereafter for a limited period.
Telkom was the first major South African-owned  enterprise  to  be  selected
for a public listing. The initial public offering,  or  IPO,  was  initially
expected to be listed within the current financial year,  but  according  to
Treasury officials the IPO is now expected  to  be  listed  in  the  2002-03
fiscal year.

Price stabilisation is practised internationally in many countries, such  as
Australia, the UK and the US, and was by Old Mutual,  for  example,  at  the
time of its listing on the London Stock Exchange. The proposed amendment  of
section 40 will be  necessary  to  assist  Telkom  in  proceeding  with  its
existing plan. It is now for the House to adopt this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 17:29.
