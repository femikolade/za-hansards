                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms S K MNUMZANA: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that African leaders gather in Nigeria today for the launch  of
       the New Africa Initiative;


  (2) further notes that the launch of the New Africa  Initiative  will  be
       spearheaded by the architects of the plan, South  African  President,
       Thabo  Mbeki,  Nigeria's  Olusegun  Obasanjo,   Algeria's   Abdelaziz
       Bouteflika and Senegal's Abdoulaye Wade;


  (3) believes that the launching of the New Africa Initiative represents a
       significant milestone on the road to  the  economic  development  and
       prosperity of the  continent  and  the  realisation  of  the  African
       Renaissance;


  (4) welcomes the launch of the New Africa Initiative; and

       maintenance money and beer worth about R10 000;

       Africans in Zandspruit informal settlement in Honeydew;

       antiretroviral drugs are just as bad as the illness;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  it is accepted worldwide that antiretrovirals change the face of
           Aids from a certain  death  sentence  to  a  chronic  manageable
           disease; and


       (b)  antiretrovirals enhance the quality of life of HIV  victims  and
           can prevent mother-to-child transmission of the HI Virus; and


  (3) calls on Mr Ngonyama not to abuse the  new  international  guidelines
       for antiretroviral drugs to promote his own agenda and to defend  the
       Government's  unjustifiable  refusal  to  make  antiretroviral  drugs
       available in the public health system.

Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next

       paid back;


  (3) expresses its concern at the fact that 1 049 person days were lost in
       the September strike by State Attorneys;


  (4) calls upon the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development to
       swiftly and mercilessly eradicate corruption in  Government,  thereby
       preventing the further disruption of justice and the exploitation  of

  (5) further urges the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development
       to get his house in order to enable the Department of Justice to play
       a positive role in fighting crime.

Mr J J KGARIMETSA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with grave concern the recent decision  by  the  United  States
       government to lift the ban on the use of political assassination as a
       weapon in its war on terrorism;


  (2) notes also the alarming record of more than two hundred assassination
       attempts carried out by United States security services  against  one
       particular head of state before the imposition of the ban;


  (3) further notes the dangerous environment that could  be  generated  if
       other states followed the example of the United States; and


  (4)  therefore  calls  upon  the  government  of  the  United  States  to
       reconsider its decision and to re-impose the  ban  on  all  political
       assassinations.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with horror that while the world focuses on fighting  terrorism
       the  bigger  enemy  of  the  human  race  escalates  its   diabolical
       activities with virtually no opposition;


  (2) condemns the actions of Planned Parenthood in New York and the United
       Nations Population Fund, who are advancing their unscrupulous  agenda
       in the name of charity, taking advantage of people when they  are  at
       their most vulnerable - in the wake of  the  collapse  of  the  World
       Trade Centre, Planned Parenthood is offering free  abortions  to  New
       Yorkers, and the UN is offering free abortions to Afghan refugees;


  (3) notes that Planned Parenthood International is  the  world's  biggest
       nongovernmental abortion  provider  and  has  helped  lobby  for  the
       legalisation of abortion in South Africa;


  (4) acknowledges -


       (a)  that while the democratic world's  fight  against  terrorism  is
           understandable,  home-based  terrorists,  largely  sponsored  by
           American money, that is Planned Parenthood and the UN,  tally  a
           death toll second to none; and


       (b)  Planned Parenthood alone has killed more New Yorkers than  Osama
           bin Laden has and that these figures pale in comparison with the
           children they have murdered in Africa, Asia and  South  America;
           and


  (5) calls on South Africans and the people  of  the  world  to  recognise
       their most insidious enemy, thriving in their midst and protected  by
       their own legislation, and to  rally  to  eradicate  this  enemy  who
       murders the unborn children of the world in broad daylight  with  the
       approval and encouragement of our governments.

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -
  (1) notes the current outbreak of violence in Zandspruit  north  west  of
       Johannesburg  between  Zimbabweans  and  South  Africans,  which  was
       sparked  by  allegations  of  Zimbabweans'  involvement  in  criminal
       activities and torturing of locals;


  (2) calls on both parties  to  desist  from  further  loss  of  life  and
       spilling of blood, and to resort to an amicable resolution  of  their
       differences;


  (3) calls for these allegations to be investigated to establish the truth
       because this situation has the potential to spread  to  other  areas,
       fuelling xenophobia amongst South Africans and urban  terror  against
       innocent people; and


  (4) recognises that it does not follow that if a person has been in South
       Africa illegally for ten years that the  person  qualifies  to  be  a
       South African as is the case in Zandspruit.

Ms O R KASIENYANE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the National Female Farmer of the Year awards function was  held
           on 16 October 2001 at Kyalami in Johannesburg; and


       (b)  the National Female Farmer of the Year awards function was  held
           for the third time since the award's inception;


  (2) believes that this serves as  an  incentive  to  encourage  women  to
       participate fully in farming;


  (3) acknowledges that at present there are many obstacles to be  overcome
       if women are to participate fully as equals in agriculture;


  (4) calls on all women, particularly African women, to  get  involved  in
       farming and agriculture;


  (5) commends the Department of Agriculture for encouraging women to  play
       their rightful role in agriculture; and


  (6) congratulates the award winners and especially the overall winner, Ms
       Lumka Witbooi.

Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the increase in the number of cases of child pornography  under
       investigation;


  (2) further notes that most  Internet  child  pornography  sites  require
       credit card details before access is allowed;
  (3) welcomes the policy of at  least  one  credit  card  company  not  to
       authorise such transactions; and


  (4) calls on -


       (a)  all credit card companies to implement similar policies;


       (b)  Internet service providers to formulate a policy to identify and
           eradicate child pornography websites; and


       (c)  all South Africans to act to eradicate  child  pornography  from
           the Internet.

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with extreme delight the manner in  which  five  South  African
       beaches fared in the Blue Flag Campaign thus getting the  recognition
       of the International Blue Flag Jury for the 2001/2002 season;


  (2) congratulates the Minister of Environmental Affairs  and  Tourism  on
       this venture;


  (3) further notes that the history and profile of these  beaches,  namely
       the Lookout, Humewood, South Beach in KwaZulu-Natal, Margate Main  in
       KwaZulu-Natal and Willard Beaches, will never be the  same  again  as
       they will  be  centres  of  tourist  attraction  in  terms  of  their
       cleanliness, scenery and tranquillity; and


  (4) calls on the touring public to visit these beaches  and  to  maintain
       their profile so that they remain a  major  financial  and  spiritual
       resource to all humans.

Mr R J B MOHLALA: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -

           handed over the completed phase one of the Stanza  Bopape  Sport
           Complex on 19 October 2001 to the Stanza Bopape community; and


       (b)  the handing-over ceremony was a significant gesture of honouring
           a stalwart of the liberation struggle of  the  people  of  South
           Africa, Comrade Johannes Maisha Stanza Bopape; and


  (2) commends the City of Tshwane Metropolitan and Gauteng governments  in
       joining forces to honour this icon of resistance.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Mev die Speaker, ek gee  kennis  dat  ek  op  die  volgende
sittingsdag sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -
  (1) die ANC-regering regstreeks verantwoordelik hou  vir  Suid-Afrika  se
       slegte paaie;


  (2) daarvan kennis neem dat slegs 10% van die jaarlikse inkomste van  R26
       miljard uit padheffings en brandstofbelastings aan die instandhouding
       van paaie bestee word;


  (3) verder kennis neem dat 10% van  die  520  000  padongelukke  jaarliks
       regstreeks deur slegte paaie veroorsaak word terwyl dit  onregstreeks
       tot 'n verdere 20% van alle padongelukke bydra; en


  (4) die ANC-regering versoek om -


       (a)  sy begrotingsprioriteite opnuut te  rangskik,  meer  fondse  vir
           Suid-Afrika se vervoerstelsels te bewillig en die vermorsing van
           miljarde rand op mislukte  onderwys-  en  gesondheidstelsels  te
           staak; en


       (b)  spesiale regeringsuitgifte te oorweeg wat geoormerk sal wees  om
           die agteruitgang van Suid-Afrika se padstelsel te stop.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next

       roads;


  (2) notes that only 10% of the annual revenue of R26  billion  from  road
       and fuel levies is being spent on road maintenance;


  (3) further notes that 10% of the 520 000 road  accidents  per  year  are
       caused directly by poor road conditions, whilst these also contribute
       indirectly to a further 20% of all road accidents; and


  (4) requests the ANC Government to -


       (a)  rearrange its budgeting priorities, vote more  funds  for  South
           Africa's transport systems and halt the wastage of  billions  of
           rands on failed education and health systems; and


       (b)  consider special state expenditure that  will  be  earmarked  to
           stop the deterioration of South Africa's road network.]

racism, but also conducting themselves and our  debates  in  a  manner  that
sets a national example. I thank you for this.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:

       a nationwide networking body for pregnancy-care centres and homes for
       pregnant mothers in South Africa;


  (2) notes that their concern for people in the community, especially many
       abandoned, orphaned and HIV/Aids babies and children in need of  care
       resulted in Abba Baby Projects  being  founded  in  1999  to  provide
       babies and children with safe and loving care;


  (3) recognises the exceptional vulnerability of these babies and the fact

   CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF FACT-FINDING MISSION TO ISRAEL AND PALESTINE
                           FROM 9 TO 19 JULY 2001

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, the National Assembly,  this  House  passed  a
motion  on  28  February  this  year  resolving   to   send   a   multiparty
parliamentary delegation to Palestine and Israel. This  mission  took  place
between  9  and  19  July  2001.  The  aim  was  to   engage   with   public
representatives, NGOs and CBOs in Palestine  and  Israel,  to  gain  insight
into the issues that are central to the conflict, to observe issues  on  the
ground, to  explore  ways  in  which  the  South  African  Parliament  could
contribute towards a peaceful resolution of that conflict,  and  to  present
the report we have presented and its findings to this House.

This report reflects the views, opinions and information  that  we  received
from documents, on-site visits to  areas  of  conflict  and  discussions  at
meetings with Palestinians  and  Israeli  representatives,  NGOs,  CBOs  and
individuals. The report is written in a very simple, easy-to-read style.  It
includes a short historical background that covers the period from  the  end
of World War I to the period of July 2001. It  recognises  that  the  issues
that were identified in 1967 by  UN  Security  Council  Resolution  242  are
still the central issues of that conflict today. These were and  still  are:
Opposition to and rejection of the establishment of  Jewish  settlements  on
occupied territories, opposition to and rejection  of  Israel's  actions  to
change the status of  Jerusalem,  the  right  to  existence  within  secure,
internationally recognised boundaries of all states within the  region,  the
attainment of the legitimate  and  inalienable  rights  of  the  Palestinian
people.

The report traces the various peace initiatives that have  been  undertaken,
for example, the one in Madrid in 1991, Washington DC, which is  also  known
as Oslo 1 in 1993, Oslo 2 in 1995, the Wye River Memorandum in 1998 and  the
Sharm Al' Sheikh Memorandum that led to the partial  withdrawal  of  Israeli
troops from occupied  territories  and  the  partial  release  of  political
prisoners. The report  also  takes  a  look  at  the  22%  of  the  original
Palestine which is now occupied by Israel and has been  divided  into  areas
A, B  and  C,  very  reminiscent  of  the  Venda,  KwaNdebele  and  KaNgwane
Bantustan splinter area system.

Having stated the reasons for the first Intifada in 1987 -  Intifada  simply
refers to Soweto-type uprisings; it is a popular  uprising  of  the  people,
which is not planned, but comes about because people have grievances  -  the
report then puts the Israeli and Palestinian perspectives  and  the  reasons
for this latest Intifada and the breakdown  of  the  peace  initiatives.  We
then look at international law practices and express a view on  the  rampant
abuse of human rights. We reflect on the impact on the  economy,  women  and
children. As parliamentarians we also look at the impact  the  conflict  has
had on the Knesset and  the  PLC,  and  suggest  the  role  parliamentarians
should play to strengthen democracy in both Palestine and Israel.

We make recommendations. One of  them  is  that,  given  that  there  is  no
military solution, and that the  economies  of  Israel  and  Palestine  have
suffered, South Africa urges both  parties  to  return  to  the  negotiating
table and  to  stop  the  violence.  Furthermore,  South  Africa  urges  the
immediate implementation of  the  Mitchell  Report,  the  Egyptian-Jordanian
Proposal, and the Tenet Plan under international supervision.  These  should
supersede the proposals such as that of former President Clinton,  the  Taba
Talks and Resolution 242 as the basis for future negotiation.  South  Africa
encourages humanitarian aid by our  Government  and  our  civil  society  to
Palestine, especially to the refugee camps. We also propose that  people-to-
people contact and  dialogue  be  encouraged  through  trilateral  relations
between Palestine, Israel and South Africa.

Due to the high number of casualties that we witnessed, I would appeal  that
the South  African  Government  investigate  the  possibility  of  voluntary
service of South African medical interns in the region; that  South  Africa,
through Parliament, invest in the development of  democracy  and  democratic
processes in  Palestine  and  Israel;  that  the  Speaker  of  the  National
Assembly be encouraged to foster and develop dialogue between  the  Israeli,
Palestinian and South African parliaments;  that  the  Parliament  of  South
Africa express support for and encourage the resumption of the  peace  talks
and also encourage the Nonaligned Movement to  use  their  position  on  the
Security Council; and that we encourage African countries  as  a  collective
and as individuals to do what they can for  a  peaceful  resolution  of  the
problem of Palestine and Israel.

As we table this report, we want to thank the Jewish Board of  Deputies  for
the abundance of material they contributed to Parliament yesterday.  We  are
very clear that we have not gone out there, spent  taxpayers  money,  to  go
and write a historical masterpiece, neither did we say in any  way  that  we
were journalists  and  would  come  up  with  a  journalistic  prize-winning
article. We wrote what we wrote because of what we saw and what we heard.

The report also draws a parallel between  apartheid  South  Africa  and  the
situation that is obtaining now in Palestine. I want to assert our  position
on this, and say that as people who  have  been  oppressed,  as  people  who
believed in the freedom of the individual and of a people, there is  no  way
that South Africans, those of us who profess to understand, to love  and  to
fight for democracy, can keep quiet,  when  we  have  seen  abuse  of  human
rights, children deprived of their rights,  women  in  despair,  old  people
living under tents and having no place to stay. It would be very  wrong  and
amount to what Dambudzo Marechera refers to as ``silence perjured'',  if  we
keep quiet.

I table this report for consideration and in so doing, I wish  to  thank  Mr
Max and Ms Booyseen Magdi, Simon Cardi and Dr Leon Gabriel. [Applause.]

Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, when Parliament voted in February of  this  year,
to send a fact-finding delegation to the Middle  East  in  order  to  better
understand the escalation in  the  violence  there,  a  distinguished  fact-
finding mission was already at  work.  It  was  set  up  by  President  Bill
Clinton and Secretary-General Kofi Annan on behalf of  the  participants  at
the second Sharm Al' Sheikh Peace  Summit  held  last  October.  That  fact-
finding committee included the EU's Mr  Javier  Solana  and  Senator  George
Mitchell after whom its report is named.

The Mitchell Report is  considered  authoritative,  it  is  fair  and  even-
handed, and I intend to address the two  main  problems  it  identifies  for
this speech. They are terrorism and  settlement,  because  the  delegation's
report remains skewed towards the standard pro-Palestinian position,  citing
the usual charge sheet of infringement of  human  rights  by  Israel,  while
omitting any serious treatment of the lynchings,  suicide  bombings  and  so
forth which prompt the closures,  curfews  and  restrictions  in  the  first
place. [Interjections.] In fact, the report puts the words ``terrorism''  in
inverted commas. That is obscene and we will not lend our  name  to  such  a
thing.

The taking of innocent life is forbidden  in  all  three  of  our  Abrahamic
religions and there is no difference that I can  see  between  doing  so  in
Manhattan, a Jerusalem pizzeria or a Tel Aviv discotheque. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Or in Afghanistan.

Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, when the  delegation  had  an  audience  with  Mr
Arafat in Gaza this  July,  he  told  us  that  he  would  expect  something
concrete from us. No doubt the report is that concrete thing. But, the  rich
irony of it all is that this report now works, I think, against the  current
position of Mr Arafat following the exposure of the  true  contours  of  the
problem in the Middle East and beyond.

I think that Robert Fisk must be right when  he  says  that  for  Osama  bin
Laden, the terrorist onslaught is primarily  about  Saudi  Arabia.  For  his
chief lieutenant, Ayman al Zawahiri,  however,  speaking  first  on  the  Al
Jazeera tape, which was screened after the 11 September attack,  it  is  far
more pointedly, and I  quote  directly  the  translation  during  the  first
broadcast, about the existence of Israel, which he  called:  ``A  continuous
crime for 50 years, in whose creation and support America  is  implicated.''
Now, Ayman al Zawahiri was himself implicated in the  assassination  of  his
President Anwar Sadat for making peace between Egypt and  Israel.  For  both
of them it is also about much more, it is about the  way  the  West  brought
the Ottoman empire to a close, in the case of Bin Laden,  and  it  is  about
the end of Islamic rule in Andalusia in 1492, for  Al  Zawahiri,  on  Fisk's
analysis drawing on that of academics.

One can pick up transcripts of sermons with  the  same  theme  broadcast  on
Palestinian TV anytime on the Internet. Here is just one sample from Gaza  a
few weeks ago and I quote: ``We are not expecting a Palestinian  state  with
Jerusalem as its  capital.  We  are  heralding  an  Islamic  caliphate  with
Jerusalem as its capital.'' This report refuses to address  incitement.  One
can believe Mary Robinson, the UN Human Righs Commissioner, as  I  do,  that
Palestinian TV broadcasts incitement to kill Jews,  or  one  can  decide  to
question, as the report does, the many Israeli peace leaders  who  expressed
their shock to us at the injunction, also broadcast  on  Palestinian  media,
to throw away their toys and become suicide bombers.

It is truth time  for  Mr  Arafat,  it  is  time  to  choose  between  those
organisations and factions who are serious about settlement  and  those  who
continue to conduct  terror,  because  they  continue  to  want  to  destroy
Israel. Now that it is truth time, what the Mitchell Report said  in  April,
is that there is not a 100% effort by the Palestinians to  condemn,  prevent
and punish terrorism. I believe that Mr Arafat himself clearly sees that  it
is truth time, making it clear both verbally and  by  donating  blood,  that
his heart bled for the USA and he did the right thing.

Palestinian police reportedly now shoot live ammunition at  his  own  stone-
throwing opponents in Gaza, rendering the treatment of the Israeli  response
to the same phenomenon not academic but part of the debate which  especially
humanrights based societies,  which  Palestine  is  not,  now  all  need  to
engage. How does one effectively  engage  religious  fundamentalism  without
ruining human rights?

I am always ready to accept the judgement of Prof John Dugard,  who  chaired
a United Nations Human Rights Commission of  inquiry  a  year  ago  and  who
concluded that Israel uses excessive disproportionate force.  I  accept  his
judgement. [Interjections.] But, I wonder  if  his  commission  would  today
still rule in the same way on the question which caused it in its own  words
equivocation and doubt, before deciding against Israel. It is whether  there
is  a  noninternational  armed  conflict,  defined  in  the  Tadic  case  as
protracted armed violence between  governmental  authorities  and  organised
armed groups. Israel argues that the threshold for armed conflict  has  been
met  and  that  Palestinian  violence   is   organised   and   orchestrated.
Palestinians say that the Intifada is an uprising  of  civilians  instigated
by loosely organised elements not properly organised groups. I have to  ask,
how can they be not  properly  organised  groups  when  Islamic  Jihad  runs
schools for young suicide bombers in Gaza?

It is because this is the legal question on which the human  rights  verdict
rests that the disputed version of the origins of the  current  violence  is
so central. The first Intifada, as  we  know,  was  the  stone-throwing  and
spontaneous uprising  of  Palestinians  living  for  the  first  time  under
Israeli occupation after the Six Day War in 1967. Palestinians did not  rise
up, however, for self-determination when they  were  living  under  Egyptian
occupation in Gaza or Jordanian occupation in the West  Bank  following  the
1948 war. [Interjections.] That was a war  which  they  all  waged  together
unsuccessfully against the one-day old infant Israel.  I  asked  Palestinian
MPs in Gaza, with whom it is possible to discuss these  matters  on  a  more
rational  basis  than  with  my  colleagues,  how   they   explained   this.
[Interjections.] They said that the Arab kings had cheated them.

Now, I have no doubt that the first Intifada was a genuine assertion of  the
Palestinian self, as opposed to the Pan-Arab identity. And, I have no  doubt
that the Palestinians today feel humiliated by their  miserable  conditions,
and justifiably so. But I  do  not  doubt  that  the  conditions  today  are
shaped, at least partially, by the sniping, the  mortar  and  suicide  bombs
which now accompany the stones  and,  indeed  the  Mitchell  Report  accepts
that. [Interjections.]

The second or Al Aqsa  Intifada,  following  Mr  Sharon's  symbolic  police-
escorted visit to the Temple Mount to outflank the challenge  from  Benjamin
Netanyahu, is said to  be  spontaneous  by  all  the  Palestinians  whom  we
questioned on this matter ... [Interjections] ... despite the fact that  two
of Mr Arafat's own Ministers have said that it was planned from  the  moment
Mr Arafat  caused  negotiations  for  the  final  stages  of  the  two-state
solution to break down last July. [Interjections.]

One  of  the  many  Palestinian  intellectuals  who  gave   us   a   nuanced
interpretation of events over many small  cups  of  the  Turkish  coffee  to
which I have now become addicted, told us that``Sharon had wakened  sleeping
horses''. The question is, what sort of horses? I was struck by  an  account
in Ha'aretz, while we were there, of the very last  interview  given  before
his death in May by Faisal Husseini, late of Orient  House.  He  said  that,
like the Greeks who hid inside the wooden horse in Troy, the time  had  come
for Palestinians to emerge from the wooden horse of Oslo. The exit from  the
horse, he said, was the  Intifada,  and  its  goal  the  liberation  of  all
historical Palestine from the river to the  sea,  even  if  it  took  1  000
years.

The PLO was founded on the principle that it would never  recognise  Israel.
The Oslo Accords reversed that position and that, of  course,  is  where  Mr
Arafat's problem lies. He has always united divergent Arab  factions  around
opposition to the existential rights of the Israelis. Will he  be  the  Arab
personality who finally legitimises the Jewish state? That is the  question,
the Israelis told us.

The Oslo principles have been under halting implementation  since  1994  and
they include the creation of the Palestinian  Authority  itself,  which  has
full control of certain towns and areas, and has civil and  police  but  not
security control of others and no control of the so-called C  areas.  It  is
this negotiated  fragmentation  that  is  often  described  as  a  Bantustan
arrangement  -  it  is  a  negotiated  arrangement.  Its  success  has  been
bedevilled by, among other factors, the second main  problem  that  Mitchell
identifies and that is Israel's ongoing  settlement  activity.  It  must  be
frozen, as president after American president has told Israel, while  Israel
went on building and expanding, and as Mitchell also tells Israel.

Land lies at the heart of the matter in the Middle  East.  Nearly  20  years
after its creation, the Jewish state suddenly found itself in possession  of
the whole of the historic lands west of Jordan. Its victory in the  Six  Day
War, once again, was provoked by the Arab states  mobilising  to  sweep  the
Jewish state into the sea. [Interjections.] Why deny what  they  said?  This
time, the war swept Jordan out of the  West  Bank  and  Egypt  out  of  Gaza
instead.

In the view of the writer Thomas Friedman, Israel spent the  next  20  years
avoiding settlement and in paralysis, at least partially,  because  much  as
they hoped that the Arabs would negotiate land for peace, they fell in  love
with especially the West Bank, the real historic homeland  Jericho,  Hebron,
and the old Jerusalem. They are not the same as Tel  Aviv  and  the  coastal
plains.

The Oslo Agreement, of course, started the break-up at that heartland.  Ehud
Barak and Bill Clinton tried to bring the final status issues to closure  at
Camp David last July but failed because  Mr  Arafat  turned  down  an  offer
including more than 90% of the occupied lands.  [Interjections.]  The  risks
that Ehud Barak was prepared to take, and  the  quality  of  the  leadership
that he was prepared to exercise are now lost. [Interjections.]

Here is the question: Will Yasser Arafat rise  to  the  occasion  this  time
with the whole anti-terrorist world  ready  to  help  him  choose  sides  in
favour of the peaceful organisations? [Interjections.] Because, when all  is
said and done, the issue is still  the  recognition  of  Israel.  The  beast
slouching towards Bethlehem is causing things to fall apart on a scale  none
of us thought we would live to see and the Middle East is vulnerable  to  it
in quite a unique way. [Applause.]

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker, hon members, the representatives of the  DP,  the
New NP and the IFP who were on the delegation to Israel and  Palestine  have
all objected to the report before the House today on the basis  that  it  is
biased. We stress that it is the representatives of these parties  who  hold
this opinion because I am not convinced that  they  necessarily  convey  the
views of all or even  the  majority  of  the  members  of  certain  parties.
[Interjections.] Their parties will have to pronounce for themselves at  the
end of this debate where they stand on this matter. [Interjections.]

If by bias, these hon members mean that the report  approaches  the  Israel-
Palestine conflict from the point of view of a principled  support  for  the
national liberation of  peoples,  a  desire  to  see  a  lasting  peace  and
stability in the Middle East, and opposition to gross  violations  of  human
rights then, certainly, the report is biased towards these ideals.

Because the ANC has consistently said that the struggle of  the  Palestinian
people is a struggle for national liberation, it  is  very  similar  to  the
struggle of  the  South  African  people  for  national  liberation  against
apartheid colonialism. [Interjections.] And this lies at the  heart  of  the
conflict, not the issues that Ms Smuts has tried to place before the  House,
that is issues of incitement,  who  has  incited  so-and-so  more  than  the
other, and questions of Pan-Arab identity. Those are not  the  matters  that
lie at the heart of this conflict.

The delegation observed, and the report reflects  these  observations,  that
the Palestinian people face all-round social, economic, cultural and  racial
oppression and discrimination. From the South  African  perspective  it  is,
indeed, very difficult to avoid seeing  parallels  between  this  oppression
and the oppression of the black South Africans under apartheid.

This perspective  is  in  keeping  with  international  consensus  that  has
developed  in  international  law  and  the   decisions   of   international
multilateral organisations.  As  far  back  as  1967,  UN  Security  Council
Resolution 242 called on Israel to withdraw from  the  territories  occupied
after 1967, and called for  the  termination  of  all  claims  or  state  of
belligerency and respect  for,  and  acknowledgement  of,  the  sovereignty,
territorial integrity, political independence of every  state  in  the  area
and their right to live in peace within secure  and  recognised  boundaries,
free from threats and acts of force. [Interjections.]

In 1974, the United Nations General Assembly  resolved  to  confer  observer
status on the PLO and reaffirm the inalienable  rights  of  the  Palestinian
people to self-determination, national  independence,  sovereignty  and  the
right of refugees to return.  [Interjections.]  I  can  write,  unlike  that
member. It is not a problem at all. [Interjections.]

Now, likewise, many of the demands that have been made  regarding  adherence
to humanitarian law find their basis in international law,  the  resolutions
of international bodies and  international  governance.  The  fourth  Geneva
Convention of 1949 clearly deals with the matter of how an  occupying  force
should conduct itself in an occupied territory. It is clear from the  report
that that is not being complied with by the Israeli state.

I would just like to say, in conclusion, that the perspectives that are  put
forward in this report and its recommendations are not anti-Israel.  Neither
this report, nor the policy of the South African Government nor that of  the
ANC is anti-Israel. We recognise the right of the state of Israel to  exist,
inter alia, on the basis of the fact that we recognise the suffering of  the
Jewish people, just as we recognise the fact  that  the  Palestinian  people
are suffering.

It is on that basis that we appeal to this House to adopt this  report,  and
to adopt the very constructive recommendations that it makes,  and  we  also
direct  an  appeal  to  the  South  African  people  to  come  together  and
demonstrate solidarity with the people of Palestine, but also to  reach  out
to both the Palestinian and the Israeli people and to share the  experiences
that we have accumulated in our struggle for national liberation to  try  to
reach a lasting peace in South Africa. [Applause.]
Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, I wish to  thank  the  members  of  the
delegation,  as  well  as  the  officials,  for  an  extremely   interesting
exercise. Especially Mama wethu [our Mother], our  leader,  who  is  a  real
Mama, full of wonderful stories. We travelled like a close family  together,
and the only regret we had was that most of us, especially myself,  ate  too
much.

I wish to deal with the report, which is a good product and contains  useful
information. In my opinion, the report should  have  been  guided  by  three
main principles, namely that we  are  not  to  side  with  any  one  of  the
parties, we must urge them to stop the violence and, we must  urge  them  to
negotiate.

The report, unfortunately, tends to take sides, and we  saw  the  petticoats
showing from the previous two speakers, Ms Smuts, no  matter  how  much  she
wanted to hide it by giving the impression that she favoured  the  Israelis,
and the ANC member favouring the Palestinians. [Interjections.]

We feel that we can agree with some of  the  recommendations,  but  some  of
them we cannot accept. However, as the report is only one small  part  of  a
very massive  exercise,  disagreeing  with  some  recommendations  does  not
prevent us from agreeing with other recommendations and most other issues.

The report contains ten recommendations, and I could live  with  about  half
of them. Recommendations two to  ten  deal  with  the  introduction  of  the
international monitoring group. The Israelis reject this  proposal  and  the
Palestinians support it. Therefore, should we support that idea, we will  be
seen as taking sides. I therefore cannot support  this.  [Interjections.]  I
will never be on the side of that, hon Minister.

Recommendation three deals with the humanitarian  aid  by  South  Africa  to
Palestine only. Again, we cannot be seen to  take  sides.  However,  if  the
recommendation was  that  humanitarian  aid  was  to  be  extended  to  both
parties, we would certainly support that.

Two of the recommendations deal with assistance  in  the  peace  process  by
international bodies such as NAM, the IPU, the CPA and SADC.  Although  one,
naturally, encourages all forms of assistance, I must  point  out  that  the
Israelis all blame NAM for siding  with  the  Palestinians.  Also,  the  IPU
passed a resolution in Jakarta last year against  Israel,  and  is  seen  as
siding with the Palestinians. Therefore, these international bodies can,  no
doubt, play a very crucial part in the peace process, but then  they  should
not contaminate the process by taking sides.

The delegation spent four to five  days  each  with  the  Israelis  and  the
Palestinians. We conducted interviews with all  of  them,  Foreign  Minister
Peres, Mr Arafat and many others.  We  travelled  to  Jerusalem,  Tel  Aviv,
Hebron, Bethlehem, Ramallah and Gaza and were  inundated  with  information,
allegations and documents.

We were told that the Middle East problems were thousands of years  old  and
started in the days of Father Abraham, who had two sons, Isaac  and  Ismael,
who, I am given to understand, are the fathers of the Palestinians  and  the
Israelis. However, what confused the issue was that each  side  appeared  to
have perfect answers. When one asks the one side, they give  one  a  perfect
answer, which is refuted by  the  other  side.  Let  me  give  members  some
examples.

The Israelis say they have made a wonderful offer to  the  Palestinians,  by
returning 97% of their land to them,  but,  they  say,  this  very  generous
offer was rejected by Arafat. One then tends to agree that the  Palestinians
are wrong. They should have accepted this wonderful  offer.  One  then  asks
the Palestinians why they refused such a good offer,  and  they  immediately
explain that it was not a good offer, but a bad one. Firstly, they  say,  it
was not 97% of the land, but less. Major  roads  and  strategic  areas  were
kept out. So, that brings one back to confusion.

In Hebron, the Palestinians asked us what a few hundred Israelis were  doing
in Hebron, which is a Palestinian town. One tends to agree with  them.  Then
we asked the Israelis why they  had  a  few  hundred  people  in  Hebron,  a
Palestinian town. They said wait a bit, their King David lived and ruled  in
Hebron, and he wrote some of the Biblical psalms in Hebron. So,  what  right
do the Palestinians have to keep them away from Hebron?

Looking at the issues as both sides have told  them,  in  my  opinion  there
appears to be about six main problems. Three of them are:  independence  for
the Palestinian state, security for the Israelis, and withdrawal of  Israeli
troops from the Palestinian areas.

Israelis will agree with one that Palestine should be  independent  but,  in
return, they demand security. They say  that  once  Israel  feels  safe  and
secure, it would withdraw its troops from the Palestinian areas.  The  basic
requirement,  therefore,  appears  to  be  security.  Israel  is   extremely
concerned about security and alleges that an  average  of  13  incidents  of
violence occur per day. Until such time as the violence stops, there  cannot
be movement towards peace.

Problem number four is the return of the  Palestinian  refugees.  There  are
around four million Palestinians who have  fled  the  area  since  the  late
1940s. UN General Assembly Resolution 242 permits them to return on  certain
conditions, but some of those conditions are rejected by the  Israelis.  The
main reason seems to be that if millions of Palestinians return  to  Israel,
and there is an election, the votes of the Palestinian people  will  be  far
more than those of the Israelis, and they will lose their state.

Problem  number  five  concerns  the  Israeli  settlers   who   settled   in
Palestinian areas, especially after the Six  Day  War.  The  United  Nations
resolved, in Resolution 242,  and  in  subsequent  resolutions,  that  these
settlers should return to Israel. I gained the impression  from  talking  to
some of the settlers that they may leave Palestinian territories.  It  seems
as if this is not an insurmountable problem.

The sixth problem concerns Jerusalem and the holy places. Who is  to  occupy
what part of Jerusalem and under what conditions?  Who  is  to  control  the
holy places? Many wise men of the world have tried to find  a  solution  for
this. I am certainly at a loss to suggest any solution. [Interjections.]  Of
all the attempts in the last decade to secure peace in the Middle  East  ...
[Interjections.] I will ask women what the answer is. As the hon member  can
see, there is no answer! [Laughter.]

Of all the many attempts in the last decade to secure peace  in  the  Middle
East, the Mitchell Report and the Tenet  Proposals  published  earlier  this
year, achieved significant success,  because  they  were  accepted  by  both
sides. Mitchell and Tenet made three main  recommendations,  namely  to  end
the violence, rebuild confidence and resume negotiations.

In conclusion, the question before us today is how this Parliament could  be
of assistance in encouraging a peaceful settlement in the Middle  East,  and
the answer, in my opinion, is contained  in  the  Mitchell  Report  and  the
Tenet Proposals. Accordingly, I suggest that this  Parliament  should,  with
respect, do the following: Firstly,  encourage  both  parties  to  stop  the
violence; secondly, give them  time  to  rebuild  confidence,  and  thirdly,
encourage both parties to resume negotiations.

I wish to add a fourth rider to this. We must not take sides, because if  we
do side with one group, we alienate the  other  and  that  contaminates  the
peace process. That is exactly, with due respect, the mistake I  think  that
the ANC and the DP are making because, by siding with one  group,  they  are
alienating the other and they will contaminate the negotiation process.

Therefore,  finally,  we  recommend  that  as  both  the  Israelis  and  the
Palestinians have accepted the Mitchell Report and the Tenet Proposals,  but
are not implementing them, the appropriate thing  is  for  both  parties  to
implement those proposals. And if any of us really want to do something  for
the Middle East, there is only one thing that I suggest:  Let  us  pray  for
them. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, there is a serious debate going on  in  the
House. Would you please not have your private meetings here!

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, the fact that  the  Middle  East  conflict
needs to be resolved is an understatement. The mere fact that the attack  on
the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon took place on exactly the same  date
as the day on which Palestine was  placed  under  British  mandate  in  1917
speaks for itself.

South  Africa  and  the  South  African  Parliament  are  well-equipped   to
facilitate peace in the area and should indeed take on this  responsibility.
Israel is South Africa's biggest trading partner in  the  Middle  East,  oil
excluded.  The  governing  party   in   Parliament   has   a   long-standing
relationship with the Palestine Liberation  Organisation.  Both  conflicting
parties trust South Africa and  told  the  fact-finding  mission  that  they
wanted to learn from our experience. However, in order to retain  the  trust
of both parties, and to facilitate peace  effectively  in  the  area,  South
Africa will have  to  demonstrate  its  impartiality.  We  have,  thus  far,
dismally failed to do so.

Hon Minister Asmal's statement during a reception for President Arafat  that
South Africa cannot be neutral in order to facilitate  peace,  and  the  ANC
equating  Zionism  with  racism  on  its  website  are   cases   in   point.
Unfortunately, the report under discussion follows  the  same  trend,  which
makes it impossible for the New  NP  to  support  it.  Although  Dr  Gabriel
worked  hard  and  put  much  effort  into  it,  the  report  was   compiled
incorrectly.

One section  should  have  reflected,  objectively,  the  viewpoint  of  the
Israelis without any comment. Another  section  should  have  reflected  the
viewpoint of the Palestinians objectively,  again  without  any  comment.  A
third section should have contained the conclusions by the  mission,  whilst
the last section should have catered for the  recommendations  made  by  the
mission.

Instead of doing this, the report leans heavily in favour of  the  viewpoint
put by the Palestinians whilst the  Israeli  point  of  view  is  constantly
subjected to comment by the compilers of that report. Let me quote only  one
example, although there are many others. On page 27 of the report  it  says,
and I quote:


  The Mayor of Jerusalem indicated that public opinion  polls  consistently
  showed that Palestinian Jerusalemites preferred to be governed by  Israel
  rather than by the Palestinian National Authority.

Then follows the comment by the compilers, which  was  supposed  to  reflect
the Israeli point of view:


  In subsequent meetings with the Palestinians  this  was  reported  to  be
  disputed by people on the ground.

Israel's nonadherence to international humanitarian law and their abuses  of
human rights are overplayed, whilst those of  the  Palestinians  are  hardly
mentioned.  Initially  the  report  was  silent  on  contraventions  by  the
Palestinians of the first  protocol  of  the  4th  Geneva  Convention  which
strictly forbids any attacks on soft targets in times of  war  or  conflict.
Fortunately, the amendment put by  the  DA  to  rectify  this  omission  was
accepted by the fact-finding mission. To equate what the  report  calls  the
oppression experienced by Palestinians with apartheid is  also  invalid  and
an open attempt to isolate  Israel  internationally  because  apartheid  has
already been condemned as a crime against humanity.

The conflict in the Middle East, and Mr  Van  der  Merwe  pointed  the  same
issue out, is extremely complicated. It emanates from  religious,  political
and cultural events which took place thousands of years ago.  Therefore,  it
is impossible for a fact-finding mission which spent only  10  days  in  the
area to pass judgment. Unfortunately, this is exactly  what  the  report  is
doing - it is passing judgement.

Demonising either Israel or the Palestinians is counterproductive  and  will
not help the peace process. Parliament should instead go out of its  way  to
encourage  people-to-people  contact   and   dialogue   through   trilateral
relations between Palestine, South Africa and Israel, as recommended in  the
report. Naturally, this would not be achieved without  being  impartial.  As
stated in the report, there is  no  military  or  violent  solution  to  the
problem.

The South African Parliament must encourage both parties  -  this  has  also
been pointed out by the hon Smuts and the hon Van der Merwe -  to  implement
the Mitchell Report and the Tenet  plan  which,  inter  alia,  provide  for:
Firstly,  a  comprehensive  cease-fire;  secondly,  a  cooling-off   period,
perhaps something that  the  DA  also  needs  at  this  point  in  time  ...
[Laughter] ... thirdly, there should be a denouncement of terrorism  by  the
Palestinian National Authority;  fourthly,  pre-emptive  operations  against
terrorists by the Palestinian National Authority; fifthly, freezing  of  all
settlement  construction  by  Israel;  sixthly,  lifting  of   closures   on
Palestinian areas by Israel; and, lastly, the transfer of all  tax  revenues
owed to the Palestinian National Authority.
Implementation of the Mitchell Report and the Tenet Plan will pave  the  way
for further negotiations with a view to  implementing  UN  Security  Council
Resolution 242, with an independent Palestinian state and the right  of  the
state of Israel to exist in peace, as its core elements. There  is  no  need
to reinvent the wheel.

Negotiations could continue where the Taba Talks left  off.  Believe  it  or
not, a Taba series of principles were established for the settlement of  the
refugee problem which, till then,  seemed  to  be  insurmountable.  The  two
sides even grew closer to each other on sensitive issues such  as  security,
borders and the position of Jerusalem, which  clearly  demonstrates  that  a
permanent peace settlement is possible.

An alarming  discovery  made  by  the  fact-finding  mission  was  that  the
politicians  on  both  sides  failed  to  prepare  the  electorate  for  the
sacrifices needed for a  peaceful  settlement.  If  Mr  Arafat  should  make
concessions, he runs the risk of being replaced by a Hamas extremist. If  an
Israeli prime minister should make concessions, he also  runs  the  risk  of
either being outsted during elections like Mr Barak  or  even  assassinated,
as was the case with the late Mr Rabin.

In South Africa's case, both  constituencies  were  well  prepared  for  the
sacrifices that had to be made. Sacrifices will have  to  be  made  by  both
Israelis and Palestinians. This is one message  that  we  as  South  African
parliamentarians must convey to our counterparts in Israel and Palestine.

The leader of the fact-finding mission, the  hon  Thandi  Modise,  conducted
our deliberations on the report in a fair and just manner. She also gave  us
ample opportunity to move amendments. If more of these amendments  had  been
accepted in order to  balance  the  report,  we  could  have  supported  it.
Unfortunately, we will now have to do the opposite.

Mr E I EBRAHIM: Madam Speaker and hon members, in July  this  year,  on  the
final day of our fact-finding mission to Israel and Palestine, we came  face
to face with young children who were part of a mock election  at  a  school.
Even at that tender age, children were thrust  into  the  political  debates
and realities of war that consume their daily lives. A young girl  of  eight
years gave us a message and asked that it be relayed to  the  South  African
Parliament on our return. Some three months later, I stand here as a  humble
messenger of this young girl, who pleaded for her voice to be  heard.  Today
she has a  platform  and  I  want  hon  members  to  hear  the  message  for
themselves. All she asks for is the right to sleep, the right  to  live  and
the right to dream.

When children go to bed in Palestine they experience nightmares and wake  up
screaming as they hear the  Israeli  helicopter  gunships  and  B52  bombers
pound their towns at night. As demonstrated last week, little  children  are
easy targets for the mighty Israeli defence force. I can remember  the  days
when our own children were also asking for the right  to  dream.  They  were
making such pleas in similar circumstances. Let  members  cast  their  minds
back to those dark nights when gunfire pierced the night skies  and  women's
screams paralysed children  with  fear  in  their  beds.  Teargas  and  live
ammunition ripped through our  neighbourhoods  with  chilling  consequences.
Those  days  of  terror  are  easy  to  forget  in  times   of   peace   and
reconciliation.

It was in those dark days that we knew who our friends were.  We  relied  on
their solidarity and depended on them  to  make  our  voices  heard  on  the
international stage. It was their loyalty and active commitment that  helped
to rid this nation of the scourge of apartheid. Now  that  we  sit  here  in
this  Assembly  with  our  freedom,  our  young  democracy   and   all   the
opportunities that our African Renaissance presents, we cannot turn a  blind
eye to the immense suffering of our Palestinian friends.

No amount of documentation or testimonial  could  have  served  as  adequate
preparation for what was witnessed on this  mission.  There  are  simply  no
words to describe the suffering of entire families who  live  under  virtual
house arrest in areas of Palestinian occupied territories. By  house  arrest
I mean 24-hour curfews that last for an indeterminate  period  of  time.  We
have heard about the imposition of curfews before but, to see what it  means
to be confined to one's home for weeks  on  end,  with  no  respite  to  buy
groceries, seek medical treatment, go to school  or  earn  a  living,  is  a
shocking reality check.

Children who dare to run into the street to get fresh air and  expend  pent-
up energy risk being shot in the back without any questions  asked.  If  one
walks into a section of Hebron, and if one casts one's eyes about, one  sees
the abandoned and desolate marketplace  and  small  balconies  crowded  with
children. Outdoor games consist of flying makeshift kites made  of  shopping
bags tied to strings. The fear in the children's eyes was evidenced  by  the
trauma of a young girl, barely a few years old, who  emerged  from  a  house
out of curiosity to see what was happening whilst we were there.  On  seeing
an Israeli soldier, she ran back into her house in panic and fear.

The  use  of  excessive  force,  against  little  Palestinian  children   in
particular, must be  condemned  in  the  strongest  possible  terms.  It  is
unacceptable  that  Israeli  forces  retaliate  against  Palestinian  stone-
throwers with rubber-coated metal bullets, teargas, live  ammunition,  heavy
machinegun fire and rockets. Recent statistics have now shown  that  83%  of
injuries sustained by children are in  the  upper  half  of  the  body.  The
percentage of injuries sustained from live ammunition has  also  risen  from
20% to 82%.  Such  naked  force  cannot  be  exerted  against  any  civilian
population, least of all young children.

In a Palestinian rehabilitation centre we witnessed little  children  maimed
and brutalised, many in wheelchairs. X-rays show that they were  wounded  by
Israeli bullets that fragmented on impact, thereby  causing  maximum  damage
to  bone  and  tissue.  Various  x-rays  showed  that  even  with   external
orthopaedic fixation devices, no bone regeneration  or  formation  could  be
achieved.

The current situation in the West Bank and  Gaza  Strip  has  an  enormously
negative impact on the  Palestinian  education  system.  Schools  have  been
closed or are  unable  to  operate  due  to  Israeli-imposed  closures.  The
Israeli military has taken over schools in Hebron to use  them  as  military
posts.

As we interviewed officials and civil society representatives on both  sides
of the divide what became clear is that Israel is an apartheid state and  it
is time that, as people with a conscience,  we  begin  to  call  a  spade  a
spade. The same vestiges of our own apartheid system that we fought so  hard
to dismantle are being implemented with a vengeance in an area of the  world
that has been called the place on earth which is the shortest route  between
humans and God. Nowhere has racism reared its ugly head so viciously  and  a
system of apartheid been exercised with such precision.

The world is familiar with the tenets of  Israel's  total  strategy  against
Palestinians,  which  includes  rage  communities,  extrajudicial  killings,
torture, curfews, detention  without  trial,  passes  and  excessive  force.
These are the same tactics that were used in apartheid South Africa. If  the
Palestinian people are to realise self-determination,  as  is  supported  by
numerous UN resolutions, the issue will have to be  internationalised  as  a
human rights issue, not a Muslim-Jewish issue. Religious  leaders  we  spoke
to in Jerusalem themselves insisted that the conflict was  not  a  religious
one, but rather a struggle between Palestinians  and  Israeli's  over  land,
which has led to the gross violation of human rights.

Former Israeli Prime Minister Barak offered Palestinians the  most  generous
offer ever by an Israeli prime minister at Camp  David  in  July  2000.  The
Palestinian refusal defied logic.  Palestinians  did  not  see  the  Israeli
offer at Camp David as even a basis for negotiation.  Prime  Minister  Barak
had, in fact, offered 87%, and only under pressure  from  President  Clinton
did he adjust it to 91%, with the land swop of 1%.

The Israeli proposal was that Israel would control the borders  with  Jordan
in the east and Egypt  in  the  south,  and  control  Palestinian  airspace.
Israel would also maintain military bases  along  the  eastern  border  with
Jordan. Israel also insisted on controlling  bypass  roads  running  through
Palestine, something that would effectively divide the territory into  three
cantons. This would have failed to leave the consolidated Palestine area  as
a contiguous landmass.

Had  these  stipulations  been  accepted,  Palestine   would   hardly   have
considered itself a sovereign state according  to  international  norms  and
standards. At best, it would  have  been  viewed  as  a  protectorate  or  a
glorified Bantustan. Yasser Arafat himself stated that had he accepted  such
a deal, the negotiators would be dancing on his grave.

Israel is implementing a shrewd military strategy of destroying  Palestinian
property and establishing Jewish settlements  in  a  systematic  land  grab.
During our visit, 12 Palestinian homes in Jerusalem were  bulldozed  to  the
ground by the Israeli army, and in  Gaza  about  14  houses  were  similarly
destroyed. Palestine is littered with detroyed family homes. As one  travels
through the West Bank and sees the wide condominiums and town houses of  up-
market Jewish settlements, one can see how  these  have  spread  across  the
hilltops like a cancer.

The situation in the Palestine areas has become  increasingly  desperate  in
recent months, with the economy having been brought to a virtual  standstill
as a result of Israeli-enforced curfews, roadblocks and the  withholding  of
revenue. Israel has instituted a policy  of  internal  closure,  effectively
sealing off Palestinian population centres  and  restricting  movement  from
one locality to another. It is clear that the  Israeli  policy  of  internal
closure has devastated the Palestinian economy, and it  constitutes  a  form
of economic  warfare  in  Israel's  attempt  to  undermine  the  Palestinian
uprising.

Laws have been designed to reduce the Arab population in the Holy  City,  to
the extent that if a Palestinian man who lives in Jerusalem marries a  woman
from Ramallah, he will not be allowed to have his wife come  and  live  with
him in Jerusalem. Those who lived  under  apartheid  would  know  what  that
means. If he subsequently moves to Ramallah, he loses  the  legal  right  to
live in Jerusalem.

As part of  their  efforts  to  demoralise  the  Palestinians,  the  Israeli
government  has  engaged  in  wanton  destruction  of  olive  trees  in  the
Palestinian area, many of which were planted during Roman times hundreds  of
years ago. The Palestinians sell the  olive  oil  to  most  Arab  countries,
although in recent years Israel has  bulldozed  and  destroyed  70%  of  the
olive trees.

The method of torture used by Israelis in detention echoes  the  stories  of
those  who  walked  out  of  the  South  African  Truth  and  Reconciliation
Commission of sleep deprivation, starvation,  beatings,  being  drenched  in
hot and cold water, being tied to a chair, rape and all sorts of methods  of
torture that continue to be documented by human rights organisations.

As was the  case  in  apartheid  South  Africa,  Israel's  institutionalised
system of racism is not only destructive internally, but  also  destabilises
the entire region and poses one of the greatest threats to world  peace  and
security. Recently this threat has become  more  acute,  and  the  need  for
international action has  become  even  more  urgent,  because  of  Israel's
escalation of its unilateral war on civilians in  the  occupied  Palestinian
territories. This form of racism constitutes a crime  against  humanity  and
must be combated.

The defining difference between the ANC and the  DP-led  opposition  is  our
recognition  of  the  fundamental  right  of  people  to   resist   military
occupation of their land, and  we  make  no  apologies  for  that.  Talk  of
Israeli security is a pretext, like that of  the  old  apartheid  state,  to
commit horrendous crimes against the Palestinian people. The only threat  to
Israel security is its wanton destruction of Palestinian  property  and  its
economy, and its total onslaught to destroy the Palestinian people.

When we speak of agitation, we must note the  comment  made  by  an  Israeli
mother in the documentary Judgment Day shown last night, when  she  revealed
how six-year-old Israeli children are taught to hate Arabs because they  say
Arabs smell, and, according to them, a good Arab is  a  dead  Arab.  Israeli
children too should have the right to live  and  the  right  to  dream,  but
Ariel Sharon makes this impossible.

In the abovementioned documentary shown last night, an  Israeli  mother  who
lost a very young child in a recent suicide  bombing  was  asked  about  her
feelings, and in her reply she said she did not blame the  suicide  bombers.
I hope Ms Dene Smuts is listening to that.  [Interjections.]  She  does  not
blame the suicide  bombers,  but  she  blames  the  Israeli  government  for
creating conditions for such suicide bombers  to  exist.  What  a  different
response from a mother who lost a child than from Ms Dene Smuts!

The editorial of The Sunday Independent last week said and I quote:


  Just as Hector Petersen has come to symbolise a generation of black youth
  committed to liberation, so has Mohammed  Al-Dora,  the  twelve-year  old
  Palestinian boy shot by Israeli soldiers while  being  sheltered  by  his
  father in Gaza in September last year come to symbolise a  generation  of
  Palestinian  youth  determined  to  achieve  statehood  and  end  Israeli
  occupation of their land.

The greatest favour that the Israelis could do for humanity is for  them  to
pack their bags and leave Palestinian land altogether with  their  army  and
their settlers. It is only then that peace will reign for all the people  in
the Holy Land, and little girls will once again have the right to  live,  to
sleep, to play and to dream. [Applause.]

Mr C T FROLICK: Madam Speaker, hon members, the report  before  us  reflects
one of the most intractable and  controversial  areas  of  conflict  in  the
world today.

The UDM is firmly of the opinion that the solution to this conflict lies  in
the recognition and  acceptance,  by  both  Israel  and  Palestine,  of  the
reality and legitimacy of each other's claim to exist as a sovereign  state.
The seeds of this dispute are  strewn  along  the  troubled  course  of  the
region's history, and both groups trace their claims to the land  back  over
many centuries.

The UDM rejects the abuse of human  rights  for  any  cause,  and  therefore
believes that South Africa must make its voice heard loud and clear that  we
do not support the domination of any group by another in  the  Middle  East.
South Africa must commit itself to  a  truly  international  mediated  peace
settlement that will  guarantee  the  sovereignty,  independence  and  self-
determination of all the people in the Middle East. The  UDM  believes  that
the current forum for implementing and monitoring agreements involving  only
Palestine, Israel and the USA must be expanded.

Section 4  highlights  various  issues  of  contention  between  Israel  and
Palestine. It appears to  us  that  both  sides  claim  that  the  other  is
provoking them into taking actions relating to the other's  actions.  It  is
clear from the varying perspectives of the two sides that there  is  a  huge
disparity in their views of the  dispute.  Blame  and  retaliation  seem  to
characterise much of their relationship, which lies  at  the  heart  of  the
difficulty in finding a peacefully negotiated solution to the dispute.

However, the UDM regards matters pertaining to violations  of  international
humanitarian law, as noted in the  report,  in  a  very  serious  light.  We
unreservedly condemn the occurrence of woeful  and  extrajudicial  killings,
torture, unlawful confinement of  protected  persons,  unjustified  military
destruction of property, the use of illegal  ammunition,  excessive  use  of
military force against innocent civilians  and  collective  punishments.  As
far  as  the  report  notes,  these  transgressions  are  committed  by  one
stakeholder. The UDM is  of  the  opinion  that  no  country  or  nation  is
justified in using these means and,  in  so  doing,  committing  crimes  and
violating human rights.

In addition, the report notes that Israeli settlers and Palestinians in  the
occupied territories have committed violence against  each  other.  However,
the weight of historical evidence suggests that there exists a  relationship
of political and military inequality between  the  two  sides,  with  Israel
imposing, by military force and  brutality,  a  sociopolitical  dispensation
which is completely unacceptable to the Palestinians. The implementation  of
these abusive measures cannot be condoned. It is  reminiscent  of  political
and military tactics that were  used  in  this  country  and  that  we  have
recently bid farewell to.

As as far as section 7 of the report is concerned, regarding  women  in  the
Intifada, we support the assertion that the issue of  women's  participation
is not the question but rather an answer to the situation.  Only  the  hard-
hearted will not be able to sympathise with the  sentiments  of  mothers  on
both sides of the conflict who watch in despair as their  children  die  not
knowing that no permanent solution can be reached through violence.

It is vital that today we recognise the strong South  African  ethnic  links
to both sides in this conflict. We must not allow our ethnic  sentiments  to
cloud our objectivity in evaluating the situation  and  the  suggestions  as
encompassed in the report. A partisan approach will widen the gap.

Although this report contains certain flaws, nothing  in  life  is  perfect,
but  it  reflects  the  situation  that  is  currently  prevailing  in   the
territory. As a result, the UDM will support  the  recommendations  in  this
report. [Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, although the  ACDP  was  not  part  of  the
delegation that  went  to  Israel  and  Palestine,  it  is  clear  that  the
delegates that were there do not agree on the report.

The report seems to have some omissions and biases. One serious omission  is
that there is no mention of the historical and religious  Jewish  link  with
the land of Israel. Instead the historical overviews begin in  1922,  as  if
there was no Jewish connection  to  Israel/Palestine  prior  to  this  date.
Nowhere in the report is it stated why the  land  of  Israel  has  been  and
continues to be of such significance to Jewish people all over the world.

The history of Israel that we read about in  the  Bible  relates  to  events
that took place hundreds of  years  before  1922.  The  report  should  have
recognised that important fact. The issue  of  Jerusalem,  for  example,  is
linked in the Bible to  Israel  and  Juda.  This  fact  has  also  not  been
acknowledged. If we want  to  succeed  in  promoting  peaceful  co-existence
between Israel and Palestine, then  all  the  historical  and  archeological
facts  must  be  taken  into  consideration,   including   those   pre-1922.
[Interjections.]

Mr M T GONIWE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order:  I  would  like  to  know
whether it is parliamentary  to  quote  verbatim  from  a  document  without
acknowledging the source?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I do not think it is unparliamentary, but  it  is
the honourable thing to do, if one is quoting, to actually  acknowledge  the
source one is quoting from. [Interjections.]
Rev K R J MESHOE: We agree that there must  be  intensive  efforts  by  both
Israelis  and  Palestinians  to  exercise  measures  for  the  cessation  of
violence, provocation and incitement, and to embark  on  confidence-building
measures to lay the foundation for, and charter the road toward,  meaningful
and lasting peace.

The ACDP cannot support all  the  recommendations  in  the  report,  but  we
support the following: Firstly, that the Parliament of  South  Africa  urges
both  Israel  and  Palestine  to  stop  the  violence  and  return  to   the
negotiating table; secondly, that the Parliament of South Africa  encourages
humanitarian aid to both Palestine and Israel by our  Government  and  civil
society, particularly  in  refugee  camps;  thirdly,  that  people-to-people
contact and dialogue  should  be  encouraged  through  trilateral  relations
between Palestine, Israel and South Africa; and fourthly, due  to  the  high
number  of  medical  casualties,  that  the  Government  of   South   Africa
investigates the possibility of voluntary service of South  African  medical
interns in the region. [Applause.]
Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, when one reads the Bible, the Old  Testament
speaks of ``an eye for an eye''. ``An eye for an eye'' is  exactly  what  is
happening at the moment in the Middle East. The peace activist  from  India,
Gandhi, said:


  If you practise an eye for an eye, you end up with the whole world blind.

'n Oog vir 'n oog lei daartoe dat 'n mens eindig met die hele wêreld  blind.
Israel en Palestina is vasgevang in 'n spiraal van geweld  waaruit  nie  een
van hul leiers kan kom nie. Dit gaan geen probleem oplos soos  wat  dit  nou
gehanteer word nie.

Agb lede sal weet die VF staan op die beginsel van selfbeskikking  om  sulke
probleme op te los. Israel het in 1948 selfbeskikking gekry toe die  moderne
Israel tot stand gekom het. Een van die eerste  lande  wat  Israel  in  1948
erken het, was Suid-Afrika. Die Israeli's behoort  daarom  te  verstaan  dat
die Palestyne ook selfbeskikking en 'n eie staat behoort  te  kry.  Ek  weet
egter dit is nie so eenvoudig nie.
Suid-Afrika  is  egter  nie  sterk  genoeg  om  die   rol   te   speel   van
internasionale polisieman, soos wat ons hier probeer doen  nie.  Daarom  wil
die VF waarsku teen enige poging van die  Suid-Afrikaanse  Regering  of  die
Parlement om kant te kies in hierdie geskil. Hierdie verslag,  soos  ek  hom
gelees het, neig telkens om kant te kies teen Israel vir die Palestyne.

Die Palestyne het 'n goeie saak en baie internasionale  steun  en  druk  aan
hulle kant. Dit is nie nodig om dit só te doen nie. Die  VF  het  egter  ook
simpatie met Israel. Ek het Israel reeds twee maal besoek,  en  ek  dink  as
Israel se voortbestaan en veiligheid nie gewaarborg word nie,  sal  ons  nie
oplossings kry nie.

Ek moet ook bysê, as die Jewish Board of  Deputies  vir  my  hierdie  boekie
stuur waarin daar gesê word hoe die Jode kant gekies het  in  die  struggle,
maak ek ook beswaar daarteen. Hier is geen Percy Yutar of Tony Leon in  nie.
Ek sal ook so 'n boekie kon uitgee oor Jode se rol in die NP aan  die  ander
kant. [Gelag.] Dit sal egter ook nie help nie.
Die ANC verstaan presies wat selfbeskikking beteken  as  oor  die  Palestyne
gepraat word, maar as Afrikaners oor selfbeskikking praat, verstaan die  ANC
skielik niks nie. Moenie dat ons selfvoldaan  dink  ons  probleme  is  alles
opgelos en ons kan niks leer by hierdie konflik nie. Kom  ons  leer  daaruit
en ons sorg dat dieselfde nie in Suid-Afrika  gebeur  nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[``An eye for an eye'' causes one to end up  with  the  whole  world  blind.
Israel and Palestine are trapped in a spiral of violence from which none  of
their leaders can escape. No problem is going  to  be  solved  the  way  the
matter is currently being handled.

Hon  members  will  know  that  the  FF  supports  the  principle  of  self-
determination to solve such problems. Israel achieved self-determination  in
1948 when the modern Israel came into being.  One  of  the  first  countries
which recognised Israel in 1948  was  South  Africa.  For  this  reason  the
Israelis ought to understand that the Palestinians also should achieve self-
determination and an own state. However, I know that it is not that simple.

However,  South  Africa  is  not  strong  enough  to  play   the   role   of
international policeman, as we are trying  to  do  here.  The  FF  therefore
wants to warn against  any  attempt  by  the  South  African  Government  or
Parliament to choose sides in this dispute. This report, as I read it,  time
and  again,  tends  to  choose  sides  against  Israel  in  favour  of   the
Palestinians.

The Palestinians have a good case and a great deal of international  support
and pressure on their side. It is not  necessary  to  do  it  in  this  way.
However, the FF also sympathises with Israel. I have visited Israel  on  two
occasions, and I think that if Israel's  continued  existence  and  security
cannot be guaranteed, we will not find solutions.

I must also add, when the Jewish Board of Deputies sends me this booklet  in
which it is explained how the Jews chose  sides  in  the  struggle,  I  also
object to that. There is no Percy Yutar or Tony Leon in  it.  I  could  also
have issued such a booklet on the role of Jews in the NP on the other  side.
[Laughter.] However, that would also not help.

The ANC understands precisely what self-determination means when  one  talks
about the Palestinians, but when Afrikaners talk  about  self-determination,
the ANC suddenly understands nothing. Let  us  not  smugly  think  that  our
problems have all been solved and that we cannot learn something  from  this
conflict. Let us learn from it and let us see to  it  that  the  same  thing
does not happen in South Africa.]

``An eye for an eye'' makes the whole world blind.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, the PAC, although regretting that it  was  not
part of the delegation, nevertheless is appreciative of this report  of  the
visit. It is a fairly thorough and balanced report.

Let me try to cut through the mountain of words and arguments and make  some
comments. Firstly, there are striking parallels between  the  South  African
apartheid problem and the  Palestinian  problem,  particularly  the  useless
debate on the ownership of  the  land,  who  came  first  and  who  must  be
evicted, etc.

Secondly, the South African problem became soluble when  there  developed  a
realisation that it was clearly unwinnable by  one  group.  The  element  of
self-interest became an important factor. This was not  a  win-lose  option.
Therefore, all parties started working for a win-win  situation,  while  the
recommendations of the fact-finding mission are about  the  presence  of  an
international monitoring body in Israel. This is the only  way  forward.  My
only amendment is that such a monitoring body must be a joint  peace-keeping
body, with an international peace corps, working with  an  equal  number  of
Palestinians and Israelis,  with  an  international  command  structure  and
exposed daily to the full glare of the electronic media.

Thirdly, the Palestinian question brings back the  debate  on  co-existence.
Can the Palestinians and the Israelis co-exist in one nation and  one  land?
In the light of the  recent  Nigerian  conflict,  can  Islam  co-exist  with
Judaism or Christianity or Hinduism? If they cannot co-exist, is  there  any
future in a world that is daily becoming more pluralistic?

Fourthly, this crisis also raises the question of  the  UN.  Can  the  world
survive without the UN? What type of UN do  we  need?  Sentimental  concepts
such as the sovereignty of national  states,  and  respect  for  territorial
integrity of states, even if horrendous violations of  human  rights  occur,
belong to the past.

We need a UN that has real teeth and muscle. Nation states must  be  allowed
to enjoy sovereign status only  if  they  uphold  democratic  and  civilised
standards and if they do not themselves endanger the future of other  states
or the whole world. Terrorism of any kind is a danger to world peace.  [Time
expired.]

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Madam Speaker,  and  colleagues,
hon Dene Smuts and hon Boy Geldenhuys blame  the  victims.  Substitute  from
their  speeches  Israel  for  the  old  apartheid   government,   substitute
Palestinians for the ANC liberation movement and we get a playback of  their
support in justification of the past for racist Pretoria and  for  apartheid
South Africa. [Applause.] I challenge them, take their  speeches,  make  the
substitutions and one will hear what these hon members were saying  pre-1990
during the 70s and 80s in particular, blame the  victims.  Israel  is  being
invaded by a Palestinian state and power. That  is  exactly  what  one  will
hear.

I am going to read a statement on this conflict, which I have  written  with
an ANC member in  the  provincial  legislature,  Max  Ozinsky.  ``Successive
Israeli  governments  and  the  world  Zionist  movement  have  consistently
denounced their critics as anti-Semites and blamed the Palestinians for  the
failure to reach a  negotiated  settlement.  We  emphatically  reject  these
assertions. We do not dispute that sectors  of  the  Palestinian  population
have resorted to terror and we condemn indiscriminate killings of  civilians
from whatever quarter, as we did in  our  country  when  we  fought  against
injustice. The point  is,  this  is  not  the  root  cause  of  the  ongoing
violence. The fundamental cause of the conflict is  Israel's  occupation  of
Palestine and the suppression of the  Palestinians'  struggle  for  national
self-determination.''

If members want to listen to the voice of Israeli government, listen to  me,
I am going to quote. ``In November 2001 the  Israeli  cabinet  considered  a
document prepared by the Prime Minister's office on  alleged  transgressions
by the Palestinians. The acting Foreign Minister,  Shlomo  Ben-Ami,  opposed
the distribution of the document, on  the  grounds  that  no  one  would  be
surprised  that  a  people  under  occupation  had  failed  to  honour   its
agreements with its occupier.'' He said:


  Accusations made by a well established society, such as Israel, about how
  a people it is oppressing - the  Palestinians  -  is  breaking  rules  to
  attain its rights do not have much credence.

Accusations made by a well established society about  how  a  people  it  is
oppressing is  breaking  rules  to  attain  its  rights  do  not  have  much
credence. They do not have much  credence  with  us  in  the  ANC  but  they
certainly have with hon members on the other side of the House.

Henry Siegman, former executive director of the  American  Jewish  Congress,
no less, observed correctly that this statement of Shlomo Ben-Ami ``goes  to
the very heart of the conflict and extracts the poison buried there''.

The establishment  of  the  state  of  Israel  in  1948  inflicted  a  great
injustice on the Palestinian people, compounded by  the  subsequent  Israeli
rule of the occupied territories and denial of the legitimate claims of  the
Palestinian refugees.

A recognition of the fundamental causes of the ongoing violence does  not  -
and I say this as a South African  of  Jewish  descent  -  constitute  anti-
Semitism nor does it amount to a denial of Israel's right to exist.  Rather,
it  constitutes  an  urgent  call  on  the  Israeli  government  to  redress
injustice and satisfy legitimate claims, without which -  and  this  is  the
point - peace negotiations will fail.

All Jews live in the shadow of the Holocaust. I grew up in  the  40s  and  I
know what that meant to a young Jewish boy in Yeoville. For  some  of  them,
though, the overriding lesson is that  survival  is  the  highest  morality.
They seek to justify Israel's intransigence in peace  negotiations  and  the
application of excessive force against the Palestinians  on  those  grounds.
Other Jews - and they live in this country and they are many, they  live  in
Israel and they are considerable, and they live in  many  countries  in  the
world - believe that the Holocaust  compels  them  to  support  justice  and
freedom from persecution for all people, regardless  of  their  nationality,
ethnicity or religion. [Applause.] As a South African of Jewish descent  and
a proud member for all my adult life of the ANC and the Communist  Party,  I
stand firmly in this camp. [Applause.]

After the suffering experienced by  Jews  in  Europe  during  Nazism,  I  am
utterly appalled at the ruthless security methods employed  by  the  Israeli
government against Palestinians, much of which smacks of the way Fascism  in
Europe dealt with people that they considered to be nonpeople. And I am  not
using the icon of  the  concentration  camps  and  those  dreadful  chimneys
belching the smoke of those who went into the gas chambers. I am not  making
that comparison. One does not need to. Israel is not doing that, but  Israel
is doing plenty of other deplorable and  disgusting  things.  These  include
the deployment of bulldozers, machine guns, tanks  and  helicopter  gunships
and the use of lethal force, as a matter of policy,  even  against  civilian
youngsters  armed  with  stones  and  slings,  targeted   assassination   of
opponents - over  50  in  this  last  year  -  the  doctrine  of  collective
punishment - did we ever hear  of  that  during  the  Second  World  War?  -
against Palestinian communities - and we have heard  very  eloquently  about
that from this report and from hon member Ismail Ebrahim, my  close  brother
and comrade in arms of over 40 years, a  Jew  and  a  Moslem  and  in  South
Africa that is what our struggle brought together  ...  [Applause]  ...  the
demolition of homes and olive groves; the stringent curfews  and  roadblocks
making normal life impossible, which all amount to a ritual of  control  and
humiliation.

These  intolerable  strategies  are  coupled  with  a  growing   number   of
provocative Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Hon Dene Smuts and hon  Boy
Geldenhuys should ask themselves where  the  provocation  for  the  Intifada
comes from, where the provocation for the resistance comes  from.  And  they
will know where the provocation of Minister Tshwete  and  my  dear  comrades
came from when we first  sought  to  change  apartheid  by  peaceful  means.
[Applause.] Those provocative settlements in the  West  Bank  undermine  the
legitimacy of the Israeli government and its negotiating position  and  give
rise to intensified resistance, and as South Africans  from  the  liberation
movement we know  very  well  that  that  would  give  rise  to  intensified
resistance that will continue to grow.

I take note of this  Report  of  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  to  Israel  and
Palestine by our MPs who visited the Middle East in July 2001.  This  report
observes that:


  It becomes difficult, particularly from a South African perspective,  not
  to draw parallels with the oppression experienced by  Palestinians  under
  the hand of Israel and the oppression experienced in South  Africa  under
  apartheid rule.

We are committed to justice and freedom for pragmatic  as  well  as  ethical
reasons. Oppression always gives rise to  rebellion  and  thereby  threatens
the security of the oppressor. That is what hon Boy Geldenhuys and hon  Dene
Smuts and their parties are so worried about - the record of  the  apartheid
years. Resistance threatens the security of the  oppressor.  Repression  and
reprisals in response to rebellion provide  no  relief.  [Interjections.]  I
will take no questions.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: No questions?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Yes, hon member, no questions.

The MINISTER: Repression and  reprisals  in  response  to  rebellion  cannot
succeed. World history shows it and the struggle  of  Jews  for  an  Israeli
homeland against the British mandate showed it very well  too,  including  a
very large amount, by the way, of terror tactics by the  likes  of  Menachem
Begin and the Stern Gang. The notion that security can be  achieved  through
reliance on force is demonstrably false, as the struggle  against  apartheid
here testified.

We understand the fears of Jews in Israel and their longing for security.  I
have been writing to my nephew and his family  in  Israel,  after  they  had
seen my letters in the press, to tell them that I am  not  against  them.  I
have made it clear to them that we are worried about their security.  As  we
know in South Africa, the point is how we gave the hon members  on  my  left
their security to live in this country. [Interjections.]

The  security  of  Israelis  and  Palestinians,  however,   is   inseparably
intertwined. Neither group will be secure  for  as  long  as  the  other  is
insecure. I am talking about the interests of Muslims, Jews  and  Christians
in the Holy Land.  There  is,  consequently,  no  viable  alternative  to  a
negotiated settlement that is just, recognises both Palestine and Israel  as
fully independent sovereign states, and provides for  peaceful  co-existence
and co-operation between these states.

We want to see an independent Palestinian state successful and  flourishing.
We think  that  the  better  the  Palestinians  will  have  it,  the  better
neighbour we shall have. That is what no less a figure  than  their  foreign
minister, Shimon Peres, has  said  recently.  We  fully  agree,  but  it  is
incumbent - and this is the point because one cannot equate the victor  with
the  oppressor  -  on  Israel,  the  dominant  force  and  power  over   the
Palestinians, to demonstrate its serious intent in this respect.

What is more, if Israel is to become a  respected  society,  and  I  am  now
talking about Israel as a state within  its  borders,  it  must  grant  full
equal rights to  all  who  dwell  within  its  borders,  namely  Christians,
Muslims and nonbelievers as well as Jews, because  those  minorities  within
Israel are victims of discriminatory treatment and laws as many  a  document
will testify.

Israel carries a great responsibility to  improve  the  dangerous  state  of
affairs in the Middle East and as we now see, post 11 September, no one  can
say that those desperate and  dastardly  deeds  were  unconnected  with  the
anger and frustration over what is being denied to Palestinians. So,  Israel
carries a great responsibility for our planet by recognising the  legitimate
rights of the Palestinian people  and  creating  the  basis  for  peace  and
stability.

We fully support the joint call to the international community by  President
Bouteflika of Algeria and our own President Mbeki in October  2001,  a  week
ago, to ensure that peace is restored to the  region  through  dialogue  and
negotiations. We support their  call  for  the  withdrawal  of  the  Israeli
forces from the Palestianian territories.

We call on South Africans of Jewish descent, and Jews everywhere,  to  raise
their voices and join all governments and people in support of  justice  for
Palestine, peace and security for all in the Holy  Land.  This  is  a  vital
step towards  reducing  the  grave  threat  of  international  disorder  and
anarchy.

As an immediate step towards peace, we call  on  the  government  of  Israel
firstly, to resume and sustain negotiations with the Palestianian  Authority
in good faith; secondly, to conduct negotiations  within  the  framework  of
the relevant resolutions of the  UN  Security  Council,  Resolution  242  in
particular; thirdly, to conduct its security operations with  restraint  and
in accordance with international humanitarian law; and fourthly, to work  in
partnership with the Palestinian leadership to build a lasting peace on  the
basis of reconciliation.

I have said that I am drawing up a statement with  Comrade  Max  Ozinsky,  a
member of the Western  Cape  Legislature.  We  are  issuing  this  statement
publicly to call on all South Africans of  Jewish  descent  to  join  us  in
signing this statement.

Finally, I would like to say that  members  have  received  this  particular
booklet. It is a very fine booklet  entitled:  Looking  Back:  Jews  in  the
Struggle for Democracy and Human Rights in South Africa. It is published  by
the Isaac and Jessie Kaplan Centre for Jewish Studies and Research.  It  has
lovely photographs and a  whole  litany  of  heroes  and  heroines  in  this
country who are of Jewish descent and who  were  involved  in  the  struggle
against racism and apartheid in this country, and for democracy for us all.

The point about this particular document is that  it  provides  lessons  for
all  people,  all  Jewish  people,  and  for  those  that  are  in   Israel.
[Interjections.] Because, the point about it is that well over  95%  to  96%
or even more of the minority, a fraction of whites in this  country,  and  a
fraction of those from the community which I hail  from,  were  involved  in
the  struggle.  The  majority  of  whites  in  this  country  acquiesced  in
apartheid and grew fat on its riches.

This is the lesson: What then motivated the  Joe  Slovos  and  Ruth  Firsts,
Sonia Buntings, Raymond Suttners, Dennis Goldbergs ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, on  a  point  of  order:  In  terms  of  the
speakers' list that has been given to us, the Minister is supposed to  speak
for 12 minutes. [Interjections.] He has now spoken ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, the hon member who is at  the  podium
still has time. [Interjections.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, I would like to  hear  your  ruling,  but  I
cannot hear you because members are making a noise. Would you please  repeat
that? [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your point of order? You  are  saying  that  the
... [Interjections.] Order! Hon member, are you talking about the amount  of
time that this hon member has?

Dr P W A MULDER: Yes, Madam Speaker. In terms of  the  speakers'  list,  the
hon member is supposed to speak for 12 minutes, but he has  now  spoken  for
more than 15 minutes. I would like to know ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, this hon member  actually  has  20  minutes.
[Applause.] He still has time. Could you please take your seat, hon  member.
[Interjections.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, may I please address  you  on  your  ruling?
[Interjections.] I accept that the hon the Minister has 20 minutes. Could  I
please ask that in future the other parties  are  also  informed  about  the
changes in time? [Interjections.]

The  MINISTER:  Yes,  20  minutes.   Twintig   minute.   [Twenty   minutes.]
[Interjections.] I still have a minute to go. Let me end with  a  lesson.  I
think the lessons are very clear. Everybody here knows the lessons.  Let  us
hope that the other side, for once, will listen  with  their  ears  and  not
their mouths. [Interjections.]

This honourable group of anti-apartheid fighters, who  were  in  fact  anti-
Zionists and rejected Zionism because they believed  in  a  common  humanity
and  that  there  should  not  be  an  exclusive  state,  stood  up  against
oppression. They showed that they were not afraid  to  speak  out  in  their
communities, even though they were such a  minority  and,  for  years,  were
outcasts from their particular tribe. They stood for justice  for  all,  for
everybody, because freedom and justice are indivisible.  That  is  the  true
message of Joe Slovo, Ray Alexander, Sonia Bunting and scores and scores  of
others. Thank you. Sibonga kakhulu. [Thank you  very  much.]  Shalom,  Salem
Aleichem. [Peace be with you.] [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam  Speaker,  for  years  reports  on  the  ongoing  war
between Israel and Palestine have been the focus of newspapers,  television,
and other media. This battle has cost the lives of many and,  to  date,  has
not resulted in peace and agreement.

Children, mothers and the aged, regardless  of  their  religion,  have  lost
their lives. The loss has been suffered on  both  sides  and  each  day  the
losses increase. It has become a way of life, to battle. It  reminds  us  of
the struggle we once fought and overcame, although we still bear the  scars.
We have learned to be one people. Unity is comprised of diverse  people  who
share, accept and respect one another.

We certainly cannot watch such bloodshed and conflict as a  nation  is  torn
in two, and  the  battles  lead  to  the  destruction  of  its  people.  The
delegation sent on this mission has certainly assisted to  create  a  better
understanding of the battle that has fallen on such a pious  land.  Further,
this understanding will assist us  in  attempting  to  offer  assistance  in
drawing this bloodshed to an end, and restoring  a  nation  of  people  that
could live together, no matter the diversity, as we do.

The aim is not to take sides but rather to assist, enough being enough.  How
many more deaths do they need? How many innocent babies are to  be  murdered
and how much more would battle serve  to  destroy  people  whose  veins  are
filled with the same blood?

Whatever it takes, guns, murder and missiles, killing are  not  the  answer.
It is hoped and prayed that the land, rich in piety  to  both  faiths,  will
see an end to this destruction, and that South Africa will be able to  offer
both guidance and assistance in achieving such peace. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mev die Speaker, eers net 'n formele saak:  Ons  sal  dringend
in die Parlement moet kyk na die gebruik dat minderheidsopinies van  verslae
nie opgeteken word nie. In hierdie dokument  wat  vir  die  nageslag  bewaar
word, staan die name van die agb Boy Geldenhuys, Koos van der Merwe en  Dene
Smuts, en die ou van buite sal dink hulle ondersteun  hierdie  dokument,  en
dit terwyl dit nie die geval was nie. Ons moet  net  asseblief  weer  hierna
kyk.

Die verslag probeer so hier en daar objektief wees en  'n  balans  handhaaf,
maar die Palestynse onderrok  hang  wel  deeglik  uit.  Baie  stellinge  wat
gemaak word, word ingelei met woorde soos, ``It has  been  reported'',  ``It
is said that'', en ``unverified so and  so''.  Die  dinge  wat  deur  Israel
genoem word, word met die teendeel beskryf en die  argument  weerlê.  Israel
se optrede word telkens in die verslag beoordeel asof dit  vredestyd  is  in
Palestina, asof daar normale omstandighede is en nie 'n  noodtoestand  heers
nie.

Kyk mens na die aanbevelings, dan kon die aanbevelings van  hierdie  verslag
net sowel deur mnr Jasser  Arafat  persoonlik  onderteken  geword  het.  Die
groot aanbeveling, wat ons ook steun, is dat daar  vredesamesprekings  gehou
moet word. Solank as wat die Palestynse terroriste  aangaan  en  mnr  Arafat
nie terrorisme kan beheer nie, kan daar nie  samesprekings  oor  vrede  wees
nie. Mnr Arafat kan honderd pinte bloed skenk, maar as  die  terrorisme  nie
ophou nie, dan sal daar nie samesprekings kan wees nie. Op 11 September  het
mnr Arafat en Israel bymekaargekom. Ons het gedog daar gaan nou  vrede  kom.
Hoekom het dit weer ontplof? Dit  is  te  wyte  aan  die  terrorisme  vanuit
daardie gebied.

Ons moet weer logies hierna kyk.  As  iemand  nog  gedink  het  dat  hierdie
verslag enigsins objektief kan wees, dan het die toesprake van  mnr  Ebrahim
en Minister Kasrils nou 'n streep  daardeur  getrek.  Dit  is  vir  my  baie
duidelik dat ons nie in 'n posisie is  om  'n  oordeel  uit  te  spreek  oor
daardie lande nie. Ons eie situasie en ons eie geskiedenis is  nog  te  rou.
Hierdie dinge krap net eie  wonde  oop,  en  ons  moet  liewer  nie  probeer
skeidsregter speel in die stryd tussen ander  lande  nie.  Dit  is  nie  tot
voordeel van Suid-Afrika nie.

Die AEB  sal  nie  hierdie  verslag  kan  onderskryf  nie.  (Translaiton  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, first of all a formal matter: We in  Parliament
will have to look urgently at the custom  of  minority  opinions  not  being
noted in reports.  In  this  document,  which  will  be  conserved  for  our
descendants, one finds the names of the hon Boy  Geldenhuys,  Koos  van  der
Merwe and Dene Smuts, and the person out there might  think  they  supported
this document, and that while this is not the case. We  should  please  look
into this again.

The report makes an effort to be objective here and there and to maintain  a
balance, but the Palestinian petticoat shows clearly. Many statements  start
with words to the effect that ``it has been reported'', ``it is said  that''
and ``unverified so and so''. The things mentioned by Israel  are  described
to the contrary and the argument refuted.  Israel's  actions  are  time  and
again condemned in the report, as if there is  peace  in  Palestine,  as  if
circumstances are normal and there is not a state of emergency.

Should one look at the recommendations, then  the  recommendations  of  this
report might just as well have been signed by Mr Yasser Arafat himself.  The
major recommendation, which we also support, is that there should  be  peace
talks. As long as the Palestinian terrorists continue and Mr  Arafat  cannot
control terrorism, there cannot  be  negotiations  about  peace.  Mr  Arafat
could donate a hundred pints of blood, but if the terrorism does  not  stop,
there cannot be negotiations. On 11  September  Mr  Arafat  and  Israel  got
together. We thought that peace would ensue. Why did it once again  explode?
This is due to the terrorism in that area.

We should look at this again logically. If  anyone  had  thought  that  this
report could be in the  least  objective,  then  the  speeches  made  by  Mr
Ebrahim and Mr Kasrils have just cancelled that out. It is very clear to  me
that we are not in a  position  to  utter  judgments  in  respect  of  those
countries. Our own situation and our own history  are  still  far  too  raw.
These things are only opening up old wounds, and we should  rather  not  try
to be the referee in a struggle between other countries. It is not to  South
Africa's advantage.

The AEB will not be able to support this report.]

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, the hon Meshoe is, as usual, as shallow as  we
expect. He should thank the Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  for  having  quoted
them, because what he said came verbatim from their document.

Nobody  disputes  the  relationship  that  Israel  has  with  the  land   of
Palestine. If the hon member's Bible is correct, and if he has  read  it  as
thoroughly as I did when I was detained, then he  could  not  come  up  with
more than 70 years of occupation in the holy land, by Israel.

Now, the hon  Ebrahim  Ebrahim  stood  here  and  spoke  about  olive  trees
thousands of years  old,  which  were  uprooted.  They  were  uprooted,  not
because they were offensive or they were in a  bad  spot,  but  because  the
tenure of the people of Palestine in that land was taken away from them.

No, the ANC cannot afford to walk the tightrope which the hon Van der  Merwe
is trying to walk. He and I are too fat, in any  case,  to  balance  on  any
rope. [Laughter.] [Applause.] I think that there is only one fact  which  is
under discussion here. That fact is that Israel is illegally  occupying  the
land of Palestine. [Applause.]

If, tomorrow, Israel gets the hell out of the 22% of  land  which  they  are
illegally occupying, then we will talk about a new  Palestinian  nation,  we
will talk about children who can sleep, we will talk about children who  can
learn, we will talk about children who say that they want to dream and  they
want to develop. [Applause.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, what does the hon member say about  the
fact that young children are trained, in Palestine, to be  suicide  bombers?
We saw it on TV there. They then go and destroy places,  like  they  did  in
Tel Aviv, where they killed 22 people. Is that okay?

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, I will address that. In a  meeting  of  women,
from which the hon Koos van der Merwe ran away, he would have heard,  if  he
had attended, that we put that question directly to the women of  Palestine.
We asked them why they were allowing their children to be  suicide  bombers.
They said that, like  all  other  women  in  the  world,  they  loved  their
children. If people, the world through, cry when their pets are killed,  why
do we think that they would allow their children to become suicide bombers?

The question we are not addressing  is:  Why  do  children  take  their  own
lives? And that brings  me  back  to  the  question  of  the  right  of  the
Palestinian people to fight for their freedom, the way we did. I would  like
to tell the hon Dr Geldenhuys that I do dare  to  draw  a  parallel  between
that and apartheid. I dare and do not  have  to  justify  incitement.  I  am
saying that if one removes the cause of the conflict,  which  drives  people
to become desperate, one removes the reason for children having  nothing  to
live for and going to fight. [Applause.]

I do not justify it. [Applause.] Yes, as a teenager, I took up arms  against
them. [Interjections.] That is the same position which a  Palestinian  child
finds himself and herself in.

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, is the hon member prepared to take  a  question.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, I will do so when I finish my speech.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! She will do take a question when she is done.

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, I am saying that the child in  both  Palestine
and Israel does not know  what  it  is  to  be  a  child  and  cannot  learn
neighbourliness. Maybe one of the  reasons  that  those  members  could  not
sympathise is that, in South Africa, they themselves could not learn  to  be
neighbours with black children. [Applause.]  They  could  not  because  they
lived under the threat and the insecurity that there was  always  this  myth
about the ``swart gevaar''. In Palestine and Israel, the ``gevaar'' are  the
Arabs. [Interjections.] I do not care to respond to the hon member.  I  will
be talking on this. I am not going to be persecuted by him.

The Women's Affairs Technical Committee reported in an open  letter  to  the
Queen of Sweden saying that, and I quote:


  ... we are traumatised by the fact that we cannot protect our children at
  the time when the slaughter occurs daily.

And I am saying that, if this does  not  touch  hon  members,  maybe  it  is
because they have never been to the townships.  Maybe  it  is  because  they
were not there  in  Sharpeville,  and  Soweto,  and  because  they  were  so
protected even against the truth  that  they  still  cannot  appreciate  the
right of people to self-determination.

There are reports, and I am drawing another  parallel  to  apartheid,  about
women giving birth at check points. There were reports about young  soldiers
examining pregnant women to ascertain as to  whether  they  were  really  in
labour or not. I stand here, as one who has given birth under  the  eyes  of
young white boys who referred to me as ``die vrou wat kalf''.  Can  the  hon
members blame me when I draw the parallel? When I get a report at a  meeting
of women Palestinian prisoners being tortured, can  hon  members  understand
that I cannot help but draw the parallel to my own experience. [Applause.]

When one walks around east and west Jerusalem and one sees  the  distinction
- the provision of services in the Israeli-occupied part  of  Jerusalem  and
the nonprovision of services  in  east  Jerusalem  -  cannot  one  think  of
Sandton and Alexandra? [Applause.] When one walks in  the  streets  and  see
queues of men - young able-bodied Palestinians who are  made  to  queue  and
the body searches and the groping in the groins - do hon members think  that
we would not make that parallel to our brothers and fathers in the  60s  and
70s, running away from the police?

When we went to Rafah, we  arrived  at  a  place  which  was  once  a  proud
residential area. We met old women, who must have been  in  their  late  70s
and 80s. They were sitting on the rubble. And if one  looked  down  at  that
rubble, one could see pieces of  their  furniture  still  there.  They  were
sitting under old tents made from their old clothing. And,  of  course,  all
that the hon Dene Smuts  was  worried  about  was  her  ``wit  skoentjies''.
[Laughter.] She said: ``Dis  mos  vir  sekuriteit.''  She  had  seen  rubble
before. She did not have to be brought there. And  what  did  the  hon  Koos
say? He said: ``I have seen poverty and devastation before, so what  are  we
doing  here?''  He  was  right.  The  hon  members  have  seen  poverty  and
devastation in South West Africa,  Namibia,  Angola  and  the  townships  of
Soweto. [Interjections.]

Ms M SMUTS: [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Are you rising on a point  of  order  or  do  you
want to ask a question, hon Smuts?

Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, does the hon member wish to take  a  question?  I
rise to ... [Interjections.]

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, I do not need to  take  this  question.  There
are members who were part of that delegation and who will confirm that  what
I am saying is true.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, please take your seat.

Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, is the hon member going to take my question?

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, I will not take her question. I am  sorry  but
I will not take her question. Perhaps one should be thankful for  this  trip
because there, at Johannesburg International Airport, I think that  was  the
first time that she spoke to me since 1994. And that  says  something  about
the hon Dene Smuts because, as we left as a South African  delegation  going
to look at the problem of conflict up there, we were carrying our past  with
us! [Interjections.]
Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: What on  earth  is  the  hon
member talking about? She is not dealing  with  the  subject  on  the  Order
Paper. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, can I have some  order!  Hon  Smuts,
is your point of order what the hon member is talking about?

Ms M SMUTS: Madam  Speaker,  I  was  saying  that  the  hon  member  is  not
addressing the subject. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! The hon member  is  going  to  proceed  with  her
speech. Can you please take your seat.

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, I was saying that, as we left this country  to
go on a fact-finding mission, some of us then discovered  that  in  fact  we
were carrying our past with us, and that we had not changed and  that  there
is a myth about black-white reconciliation in this  country.  If  it  was  a
reconciliation we all believed  in,  we  would  all  have  been  honest  and
objective   about   what   was   obtaining    materially    in    Palestine.
[Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, on a point of  order:  There  is  a  subject
which is being discussed  here,  and  the  speaker  is  not  addressing  the
subject. She is talking about South Africa. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon  Gibson,  please  take  your  seat.  The  hon
member is addressing the issue of the trip to Palestine and Israel.  She  is
talking about that experience. [Interjections.] Please take  your  seat  and
let the member finish! [Applause.]

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, I am drawing this parallel  between  Palestine
and South Africa deliberately. When the people of Palestine ...

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker ...

Ms T R MODISE: You are wasting my time, Douglas.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!
Mr D H M GIBSON: The subject which is being discussed ...

Ms T R MODISE: You are wasting my time. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, may I please have some  order  so  I
can hear what the hon members are saying. [Interjections.] Yes, hon Gibson?

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, the subject which is being discussed ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Gibson, I know the  subject  which  is  being
discussed. [Interjections.]

Mr  D  H  M  GIBSON:  Madam  Speaker,  please  allow  me  to  address   you.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, hon member.

Mr D H M GIBSON: We are considering the report, Madam Speaker.
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I know that, hon member. [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: We are not considering who spoke to whom at the airport  in
Johannesburg. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Gibson, please take your seat.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, are you refusing me  the  right  to  address
you on a point of order? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am refusing you the right  to  continue  to  undermine
the Chair. That is what I am refusing you the right to do. Please take  your
seat. Take your seat, hon Gibson. Hon member, please finish your speech.

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, when the NP took over power  in  this  country
in 1948 and started relieving us as black people of  87%  of  our  land,  in
Palestine people were preparing for war. Israel took and occupied more  than
78% of the original Palestine.

The Palestinian people have the right to return  to  their  ancestral  land.
Nobody can arbitrarily decide to  take  this  right  away  from  them.  When
Jewish people state that to allow Palestinians the right to return would  be
to dilute the Jewish character of the state, we  must  then  ask  ourselves:
Where is this democracy which people profess they believe  in  and  support?
Where are these values which people say they have stood for for years?

When  the  Israeli  state   institutionalises   discrimination,   and   when
Palestinian residents of Jerusalem go out and  are  declassified  and  given
passes, or when families who are mixed, a  Palestinian  married  to  a  Jew,
find that they are declassified, where  is  democracy?  Where  is  fairness?
Where is this religion Rev Meshoe is speaking about? Clearly the  people  of
Palestine must be allowed to return.

Lastly, when  Israel  takes  hungry  Ethiopian  and  Cameroonian  youths  to
Palestine and Israel and trains them as  soldiers,  and  then  deploys  them
against Palestinians, does this not remind us of 1976? [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The Acting Chief Whip of the  Majority  Party  moved:  That  the  report  be
adopted.

                    PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION FROM KNESSET

                               (Announcement)

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I wish to announce that the  Speaker
of the National Assembly has advised the Speaker of the  Knesset  in  Israel
that we would be happy to receive a parliamentary delegation next year  from
themselves,  because  they  had  written  to  us  requesting  to  visit  our
Parliament. This, I think we need to note, is in keeping  with  one  of  the
recommendations in the report,  which  suggests  that  the  Speaker  of  the
National Assembly of our Parliament is encouraged to foster  and  develop  a
dialogue between the parliaments  of  Palestine,  Israel  and  South  Africa
through  interparliamentary  exchanges  with   Speakers   and   members   of
parliament. In keeping with that, we have agreed to  receive  a  delegation,
and the members will be informed of the details in due course.

                  PRIVATE SECURITY INDUSTRY REGULATION BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Speaker, hon  members,  when  the
Government came into power in 1994, it clearly expressed its  commitment  to
addressing  broad  issues  relating  to  transformation.  As  part  of  this
transformation  process,  there  was  a  need  to  review  legislation   ...
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister!  Hon  members,  you  are
making a noise. I do  not  know  who  told  you  that  the  House  has  been
adjourned. I see every one of  you  moving  out.  Could  you  continue,  hon
Minister.

The MINISTER: Thank you, Chair. As  part  of  this  transformation  process,
there was a need to review legislation that was passed during the  apartheid
era in order to bring  South  African  legislation  in  line  with  the  new
democratic and constitutional dispensation which we have today. One  of  the
legislative reforms was the passing of the Security Officers  Amendment  Act
of 1997, which required me as the Minister of Safety and Security to  reform
the regulatory framework. In terms of this amending Act, I was  required  to
draft a new Bill, which we have before us today.

As part of drafting the new Bill,  I  took  into  account  various  factors,
including the fact that the existing  Security  Officers  Amendment  Act  of
1997 has become outdated given the changes in the nature  of  the  industry.
The industry has changed significantly, and it is no longer confined  solely
to the guarding and protection of persons and premises. These  changes  have
resulted from the growth and proliferation of new  sectors  of  the  private
security industry such as  the  providers  of  security  equipment,  private
investigators and highly technologically  advanced  service  providers;  the
capacity of private security companies to procure arms;  and  concerns  that
the industry possibly contains some elements  that  have  the  potential  to
engage in abuse, and the implications of such abuse for the security of  the
state.

The industry has shown phenomenal growth. According to  statistics  supplied
by the Security Officers' Interim Board, there  were  in  excess  of  6  000
active private security businesses registered with the  board  by  the  year
2000. Of these 3 232  were  actively  registered  guarding  businesses,  609
actively registered cash-in-transit businesses, and 878 actively  registered
armed  response  businesses.  It  has  been   estimated   that   there   are
approximately 652 persons involved in  private  investigations  and  844  in
other categories.
During this period, there were approximately  165  300  actively  registered
security guards employed by the  industry.  This  figure  excluded  security
guards who are employed as in-house security  personnel,  and  who  are  not
currently registered as security guards. The estimate for in-house  security
personnel varied from 60 000 to  100  000.  The  Private  Security  Industry
Regulation Bill now brings in-house security providers under the  regulatory
framework.

A further consideration was that the industry was fraught with  in-fighting,
competing interests and allegations of wrongdoing. There  was  a  perception
that the inclusion of representatives of employers and  employees  from  the
private security industry in the regulatory  board  did  not  contribute  to
proper and effective regulation of the private security industry because  of
vested and competing interests.  These  had  serious  implications  for  the
credibility of the board. All these concerns needed to be addressed,  and  I
believe that the Private Security Industry Regulation Bill has been  crafted
to do exactly that.
The Bill expands on the objects  and  functions  of  the  future  regulatory
authority to enable it to regulate the industry, and to  exercise  effective
control over security service providers, both in  the  public  and  national
interest as well as in  the  interests  of  the  security  of  the  industry
itself. The future regulatory authority is  tasked  to  encourage  ownership
and  control  of  security  businesses  by  persons  who  are   historically
disadvantaged, as well as to promote their empowerment and  advancement.  In
addressing the need for proper and effective  regulation  of  the  industry,
the Government felt very strongly that those  entrusted  with  the  task  of
regulating the  industry  should  not  have  any  interest  in  the  private
security industry. The reasons for this are obvious.

Indeed, the Bill provides for such a regulatory authority,  which  will  act
through a council that is independent of the  industry.  The  Government  is
convinced  that  such  independence  will  contribute  immensely  to  better
regulation in the interests of all concerned. We would  like  to  underscore
the pertinent point that the voice of the  industry  will  not  be  ignored.
Indeed, provision to listen to the voices of the private  security  industry
through committees, which the council is empowered to appoint,  is  captured
in the Bill.

National  security  and  the  protection  of  individuals  are  the  highest
priorities of any  government.  The  Government  is  acutely  aware  of  the
sensitive nature of the private security industry, and  the  need  to  avoid
and eliminate the dangers associated with the involvement  of  irresponsible
persons in the industry. It is in this context that the  Bill  provides  for
strict entry requirements. One of the entry requirements is that any  person
who wants to be registered as a security service provider must be a  citizen
of South Africa or have permanent residence status  in  the  country.  Since
the advent of our new democratic order and  our  country's  entry  into  the
international  community  of  nations,  as  well  as  the  implications   of
globalisation, there has been a renewed interest on the part  of  foreigners
to invest in  various  business  ventures  in  the  country,  including  the
private security sector.

This interest manifested itself in the past few months  when  several  South
African businesses were purchased by foreign businesses for amounts  ranging
from approximately R400 million to R630 million, with  more  interest  shown
by other  companies.  The  decision  to  allow  foreign  investment  in  the
security sector does not in any way compromise the security of our  country,
given the fact that there are sufficient safeguards in the  Bill  itself  to
ensure that this is the case. The decision allows the  use  of  the  capital
and expertise from foreign sources to the best advantage of South Africa  as
a whole.

The advantage of such foreign  shareholding  and  investment  would  be  the
bringing in of skills,  expertise  and  technological  know-how  which  will
benefit not only  the  security  industry  but  the  broader  South  African
economy. In addition, one such obvious spin-off of the foreign  shareholding
element will be the enhancement of black economic empowerment. As  a  matter
of fact, this specific issue was widely canvassed by the department and  the
leading companies from abroad that are currently involved in the industry.

I have no doubt in my mind that this  commitment  by  these  companies  will
translate into the consolidation of the  emerging  of  black  businesses  in
this sector. Indeed, the  future  regulatory  authority  has,  as  indicated
earlier, identified  the  important  object  of  encouraging  ownership  and
control of security businesses by  historically  disadvantaged  persons  and
promoting the empowerment and advancement of such persons.  This  aspect  of
the transformation and empowerment agenda must be vigorously pursued.

As part of the protection  of  our  national  interests,  the  Bill  further
provides that any  applicant  who  is  a  former  member  of  any  military,
security, police or  intelligence  force  or  service  in  South  Africa  or
elsewhere must submit a prescribed clearance certificate  from  his  or  her
previous employer. It also clearly prohibits persons  who  are  employed  by
the South African Police Service, the South African National Defence  Force,
the Scorpions, the NIA, Sars and Correctional Services from moonlighting  as
security service providers. Moonlighting is  frowned  upon  and  will  be  a
criminal offence.

The Bill further provides for a  code  of  conduct  for  both  the  security
service providers and inspectors. The inspectors have been given  powers  to
ensure that security service providers comply with the requirements  of  the
Bill. The  private  security  industry  has  acquired  capabilities  and  is
undertaking operations  which  may  infringe  on  every  person's  right  to
privacy and, as such, infringe upon constitutional rights.  These  practices
need to be limited by regulation so as to ensure that the  rights  enshrined
in the Constitution continue to be protected.

I am confident that the Bill contains sufficient provisions to regulate  the
private security industry in the interests  of  all  stakeholders.  I  would
like to believe that the  changes  introduced  at  the  portfolio  committee
level were  intended  to  bolster  this  idea  of  regulating  the  security
industry objectively and in the interests of all concerned.

Whilst the regulatory authority  is  tasked  to  regulate  and  control  the
private  security  industry,  this  authority  itself  will  not  be   above
scrutiny. The regulatory authority will be accountable to the  Minister  and
ultimately to Parliament.

I know that the process of drafting this Bill has been a  difficult  one.  I
am grateful for the contributions from all. I want to take this  opportunity
to thank the various people who assisted during this process.  I  also  take
this opportunity  to  thank  Mr  Mluleki  George,  the  chairperson  of  the
portfolio committee, for  guiding  the  finalisation  of  the  Bill  in  the
portfolio committee, members  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Safety  and
Security, the National Secretariat for Safety and  Security  and  the  legal
division  of  the  South  African  Police  Service,  the   interdepartmental
workgroup which contributed to developing the policy from  which  this  Bill
flows, and the foreign  companies  which  have  invested  in  South  African
security companies for the responsible  and  constructive  manner  in  which
they dealt with the issue relating to  their  shareholding  and  investment.
[Applause.]

Adv P S SWART: Mr Chairperson,  the  Private  Security  Industry  Regulation
Bill before the House aims, and I quote:


  To provide for the regulation of the private security industry; for  that
  purpose to establish a regulatory authority; and to provide  for  matters
  connected therewith.

All the parties in the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Safety  and  Security  had
consensus about  the  need  for  proper  regulation  of  this  industry,  an
industry filled with problems, businesses not registering with  the  Interim
Security Industry Board, fly-by-night operators, noncompliance  with  labour
laws resulting in non-adherence to minimum wages and  many  other  problems.
As a result, there are often many  questions  asked  about  the  quality  of
service which is provided to clients.

This industry must be seen in context. The South African Police Service  has
approximately 121 000 members. The private  security  industry  has  in  the
region of 190 000  employees.  It  is  often  stated  that  there  are  more
firearms in the industry than in the South African Police Service,  which  I
believe to be the case. Thus, all parties supported the desirability of  the
Bill, as well as the broad principles stated in the policy document.

However, before I deal with the Bill itself, allow me to thank  the  members
of  the  portfolio  committee,  all  parties  included,  in  particular  the
chairperson, the hon Mluleki George, for the  productive  way  in  which  we
were able to handle this  Bill.  Although  the  ANC  often  failed  to  heed
suggestions based on the presentations during the public hearings, at  least
the opposition was never denied the opportunity to put these on  the  table.
Also allow me to thank  the  drafters  of  the  Bill  from  the  department,
assisted by the Secretariat, for the hours  and  production  they  have  put
into this Bill.

While giving thanks,  I  need  to  put  into  perspective  what  took  place
surrounding possibly the most controversial part  of  the  deliberations  on
the Bill, namely foreign  investment.  I  am  very  thankful  for  what  the
Minister said here today.

When the Bill was tabled the first time, clause 20(2)(a) stated that, and  I
quote:


  A security business may only be registered as a security service provider
  -


  (a) if all the persons  performing  executive,  controlling  or  managing
       functions ... are registered as security service providers ...

The word ``controlling'' had a direct  relevance  to  ownership  of  such  a
business and, in the case of companies, shareholding.  In  this  regard  the
word ``controlling'' must be  associated  with  foreign  shareholding  where
foreign investment is concerned.
Clause 21 indicates that each director must  register  and  clause  22(1)(a)
indicates that any natural  person  applying  for  registration  must  be  a
citizen of or have permanent resident status in South Africa.

At the time when this Bill was tabled, an international  company,  ADT,  was
in an advanced stage of acquiring a South African security  company,  Sentry
Security. The international lawyers, as  a  result  of  the  Bill  and  this
control in the Bill, put  this  deal,  involving  R650  million  in  foreign
investment, on hold. As a result of this, I facilitated a meeting  with  the
national director of Tyco, who flew to South Africa, and arranged a  meeting
with the chairperson of the committee. The matter was  discussed  at  length
and after the ANC's study group considered it, the  foreign  investors  were
assured that the portfolio committee would ensure that this Bill  would  not
prohibit foreign investment. As a result of this assurance,  the  deal  went
through.

This particular clause only came  up  late  in  September  when,  all  of  a
sudden, it was stated that the  ANC  had  changed  its  mind  and  that  all
foreign investment would be  prohibited.  On  asking  questions  about  this
change of heart,  we  were  informed  that  Cabinet  was  adamant  that  the
industry should be 100% under the control of South Africans, with an  add-on
of ``it is time that black empowerment in  the  industry  takes  place''.  A
member of the ANC informed  the  portfolio  committee  that  the  ANC  would
ensure that banks in South Africa finance  such  people  to  buy  out  these
foreign companies.

The House must note that within the last couple of years  somewhere  between
R1,5 billion and R3 billion was invested in the private  security  industry.
One can imagine the  consternation  this  caused  within  the  industry  and
abroad. I personally find it a bit strange and it left a sour  taste  in  my
mouth - I must be honest about this - that members of  Parliament  from  the
ANC within the portfolio committee were not allowed to  make  up  their  own
minds but were forced by Cabinet, apparently under the  instigation  of  the
Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Fortunately, this changed when the Minister of Safety and  Security,  either
under pressure from business or possibly from the more sensible  members  of
his  Cabinet,  the  Minister  of  Finance  or   of   Trade   and   Industry,
reconsidered. But, in this regard, I want to thank the hon the  Minister  of
Safety and Security. I trust that this will minimise the damage, as well  as
what the Minister said here today, although negative signals were  sent  out
to investors.

Now, I would like  to  talk  about  problems  that  remain  unresolved.  The
original Bill included locksmiths, polygraphers and  private  investigators,
thus including them within the ambit of regulation. The ANC  members  agreed
on the exclusion of polygraphers, but remained adamant that  locksmiths  and
private investigators be included.

Regarding private investigators, the definition was changed in  such  a  way
that the problems stated by the Banking Council  and  Telkom  regarding  in-
house investigations are no longer valid, and  we  are  thankful  for  that.
But, locksmiths remained a  problem,  and  even  after  the  definition  was
changed, it did not solve  the  problem.  During  the  public  hearings  the
Locksmith Association  indicated  that  for  a  long  time  legislation  was
pending to regulate them, a preferred option to being included in this  very
broad industry. This went unheeded by the ANC.

Although there was consensus by all parties that the  intention  is  not  to
include the person or small business who  cuts  keys  while  also  repairing
shoes, the definition does include them, where it states  that  a  locksmith
means a person who, for the  benefit  of  another  person,  engages  in  any
activity or business which is related to the opening,  closing  or  engaging
of locking mechanisms. This correlates with the addition to  the  definition
of ``security equipment'' by adding subsection (f) stating  that  ``security
equipment means, inter alia, a  specialised  device  used  to  reproduce  or
duplicate keys''. This means that those  people  who  are  cutting  keys  at
those little shops in the shopping  malls  will  now  have  to  register  as
security service providers, pay levies and be open for  inspections  on  the
whole ambit of this Bill. We cannot agree with this.

However, the biggest problem with this Bill, and I heard what  the  Minister
said, is the composition of the council which  will  govern  the  authority.
Initially the Bill made provision  for  the  chairperson,  vice-chairperson,
three additional councillors appointed by Minister as well as  the  director
of authority who, in practice, would be the CEO, to serve  on  the  council.
No provision was made for any representation by the industry itself,  be  it
employees or employers.

During the public hearings employer organisations as well as all the  unions
involved in this industry stated that representivity would be  a  necessity.
The DA never argued for a majority representation on this council. In  other
words, the independence of the  majority  would  have  been  safe.  But,  we
argued  at  least  for  councillors  representing  the  employees  and   the
employers. This proposal was rejected by the ANC by stating that section  13
makes provision for committees to be appointed. That  is  indeed  the  case,
but only that the council ``may'' appoint one or more committees.

My own proposed amendment was to  amend  section  13  to  include  that  the
council ``must'' appoint standing committees for  employees  and  employers,
those two standing committees, and make provision for their chairpersons  to
serve on the council. But, although I asked the ANC study group to  consider
if they do not want the chairpersons to be on the council, they  should,  at
least,  consider  the  obligatory  appointment   of   those   two   standing
committees. But it was without any success.

Now, it means that section 13 remains ``may'' appoint committees  and  there
is thus no insurance that the industry will be represented at any  level  or
involved in any decision-making of the council,  which  will  be  funded  by
levies paid by the people  within  the  industry,  employers  and  employees
alike. The DA find this an untenable situation. The crux  of  this  Bill  is
the regulation of the industry and the DA will fail its constituency  if  it
supports a Bill that denies any democratic involvement in the regulating  of
the industry. This denial is by itself sufficient to oppose this  Bill.  The
other problems to those  I  alluded  to,  as  well  as  the  ones  which  my
colleague will deal with, only strengthen this resolve.

Furthermore, in addition to all the powers given to the  Minister  in  terms
of the industry and its authority, section 11  empowers  the  Minister  with
specific interventions if he is not satisfied that the council maintains  an
acceptable standard and the fulfilment. These include issuing  a  directive,
which is fine, assuming responsibility for the relevant functional  duty  by
the  Minister  himself  or  dissolving  the  council.  The  DA  proposes  an
amendment to this section to allow for the dissolvement of the council  only
under specific circumstances or that that should be a last  step  after  the
issuing of directives  took  place.  Although  the  ANC  and  the  portfolio
committee indicated that they regarded this as a last step,  section  11  is
clear that it is not a last step, but rather an ``and/or'' option.  We  find
it untenable to allow the Minister to do this as  an  ``or''  option  or  to
assume responsibility. My colleague will deal with this further.

The portfolio  committee  managed  to  tone  down  some  of  the  powers  of
inspectors whilst inspecting members of  this  industry  and  various  other
draconian parts of the Bill, and for that  I  want  to  thank  the  ANC  for
showing sensible judgment. A last problem of section 25, my  colleague  from
the IFP will  deal  with,  regarding  the  suspension  of  membership  of  a
registration of a business pending the conclusion of  investigation  by  the
authority itself. My time does not allow me to do that.

To conclude, apart from the specific problems indicated by me, I am  of  the
opinion that this is a reasonable Bill and will go a long way to  regulating
the industry. If it were not for the lack of representation from within  the
industry on authority, whilst funding  it,  as  well  as  the  inclusion  of
locksmiths, the DA could very well have been in a position to  support  this
Bill. And the House will  hear  this  afternoon  that  even  the  opposition
parties supporting this Bill do so with reservations. Unfortunately, the  DP
cannot support this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr M E GEORGE: Chairperson, hon  Minister,  and  members  of  Parliament,  I
welcome  the  opportunity  to  present  this   Private   Security   Industry
Regulation  Bill  on  behalf  of  our  portfolio  committee.  The  aims  and
objectives of this Bill is to  close  loopholes  in  the  previous  Security
Officers Act, as amended, which proved to be unable to contain the  lack  of
professionalism, accountability, and trustworthiness  which  are  prevailing
in the private security industry.

The Bill provides for the proper and  strict  regulation  of  the  industry,
which is very sensitive and also necessary for the  adequate  protection  of
fundamental rights to life and protection of persons and property.  It  must
be borne in mind  that  the  responsibility  to  protect  the  citizens  and
property lies with the security forces  of  the  state,  especially  the  SA
Police Service. While appreciating the complementary  role  played  by  this
industry, I must state from the beginning that this industry thrives on  the
high levels of crime. Its growth can therefore be seen as both positive  and
negative.

This Bill creates a new supreme regulatory authority  as  a  separate  legal
persona  replacing  the  present  interim  Security  Officers  Board.   This
authority must consist of independent persons who have neither  a  financial
interest in the security industry  or  representing  neither  employees  nor
employers in this industry.  Probably  that  is  where  we  differ  with  my
colleague Paul.

It is important that the Minister must appoint people of high  integrity  to
serve in the regulatory authority. The sensitivity of this  industry  cannot
be over emphasised, and people must remember that some  of  the  people  who
formed this industry are people who resigned from the SA Defence  Force  and
the SA Police because they were  against  or  not  happy  with  the  present
dispensation, hence it has  been  associated  with  elements  of  the  third
force.

There are about 22 security associations  in  the  country,  reflecting  the
diversity and fragmentation of the industry, which would make  it  difficult
to form a representative council even if we were to compromise with the  DP,
New NP and IFP. Up to now, even today, I was  hoping  that  my  friend  Paul
will convince us as to how this representative body would  be  formed  under
these circumstances. He has failed to do that. We have  also  not  forgotten
the past. The present Security Officers Board  consists  of  representatives
from the industry and it collapsed many times because of infighting and  all
those things. So, I still want to know how on earth, even if one  wanted  to
compromise, one could have done what they wanted.

It has  been  established  that  this  industry  has  more  personpower  and
firearms than the whole SAPS put together. Besides having  more  personpower
and firearms, it  has  more  vehicles  than  the  SAPS.  For  example,  this
industry has 80 000 vehicles as opposed to the 30 000 vehicles of the  SAPS.
The infighting within the present board,  which  is  representative,  though
not the main  reason,  it  has  contributed  to  us  making  sure  that  the
authority is completely independent.

There was never a more appropriate time than now  to  make  sure  that  this
industry is properly regulated  and  properly  monitored.  Events  in  other
parts of the world have shown that this industry can  be  a  threat  to  the
security of the state if not watched closely. Periodic renewals of  licences
and highly empowered inspectors are the key to the success of this Bill.

It has been argued that  the  powers  of  these  inspectors  are  excessive,
especially by my colleague who has just spoken. That is something  which  is
far from the truth. These inspectors  will  not  be  dealing  with  ordinary
citizens or businesses that have nothing to do with the  security  industry.
Even security industries that run their businesses  in  a  professional  and
trustworthy  manner  should  not  worry  about   these   inspectors.   These
inspectors will be subjected to a code of conduct that operates  within  the
law and cannot abuse their  powers.  The  main  purpose  of  this  Bill  and
therefore the inspectors is to ensure that all  security  providers  act  in
the public and national interest in rendering security services.

This industry is notorious for not looking after its workers. That is why  I
want to take this opportunity to urge  the  Minister  and  the  Minister  of
Labour to make sure that the minimum wages envisaged in the  Bill  will  not
only be reasonable, but very good and that the inspectors  will  see  to  it
that they are adhered to. Linked to the minimum wage  is  the  proviso  that
the security service providers must be properly trained, and  clause  34  of
the Bill empowers the Minister to make regulations which will make  training
obligatory.

Guards working in the  private  security  industry  have  historically  been
badly paid and often work long hours. Working conditions within the  private
security industry are a matter of serious concern  and  the  authority  must
address these concerns. We must remember that here we  are  not  talking  of
people working in Shoprite Checkers or a bakery,  baking  bread  and  cakes,
but we are talking of trained people who sometimes carry firearms.

It is on this basis that  this  Bill  allows  the  Minister  to  make  quick
interventions in the event of  things  not  going  right.  This  Parliament,
through this Bill, must make sure that this industry does not  get  involved
in political and criminal destabilisation. The authority  will  be  able  to
collect money from  the  security  service  providers  through  the  Act  of
Parliament which will be passed  soon,  and  which  is  called  the  private
security industry levies Act.

There have been arguments that the state must pay  for  the  functioning  of
the authority especially  because  they  will  not  be  represented.  It  is
difficult to understand why the Government should pay for an industry  which
is making huge profits. There are many problems in this industry which  also
necessitate regulations, and it is in the interests  of  the  industry  that
this is done. Therefore, there is no good argument why they should  not  pay
as the administration done by the authority will be for their own good.  Any
attempt not to pay, as I have heard, will be regarded  as  illegal  and  can
lead to serious consequences, like withdrawal of the licence.

Let me end by addressing the issue of foreign involvement in  the  industry.
Foreign shareholding will be allowed, as was agreed.  What  we  envisage  is
that the foreign companies will be able to allow  black  empowerment  groups
and South Africans in general to participate in their companies.

We must also add that the issue of foreign involvement must,  from  time  to
time, be reviewed. We welcome foreign involvement, but it must  also  be  in
the interest of the  country.  The  directors  and  managers  managing  this
industry must still be South African  citizens  or  permanent  residents  of
South Africa. This is to make sure that the people  who  run  this  industry
are directly accountable to the authority or  the  Minister  of  Safety  and
Security.

Private security providers  should  have  limited  powers  and  be  strictly
regulated. They should not see themselves as providing the same  service  as
the police. Their access to firearms must be properly  monitored  to  comply
with the Firearms Control Act.

I wish to thank the legal team of the Department of Safety  and  Security  -
led by Adv Koch, and the Secretariat - led  by  Mr  Rasegatla  -  for  their
sterling work. Without their support and hard work it would have  been  very
difficult for the portfolio committee to finish the work.

Lastly, I must thank the  members  of  the  portfolio  committee  for  their
support and even in respect of those who are opposing  this  Bill,  I  still
welcome their contribution. That is why we believe in multiparty  democracy.
Even though they will be opposing the Bill their contribution  to  the  Bill
was very much appreciated. [Applause.]

Mr E T FERREIRA: Chairperson, the  IFP  acknowledges  the  urgent  need  for
legislation for the private security industry. The industry is  in  turmoil,
with fly-by-night security operators doing irreparable harm to the  name  of
the industry. Workers are often exploited in this industry,  and  are  often
not even paid the already too low minimum wages.

Many people will be shocked to know that thousands of  security  guards  and
officers in our country are paid just over R1 000 per month for working  12-
hour shifts at a time. That much stricter legislation is needed  is  not  in
dispute. As far as this Bill in front  of  us  is  concerned,  however,  the
question can, very rightly, be asked whether it is not going to create  more
problems than it will be solving.

If I can use soccer terms, there have always been red card and  yellow  card
issues in this Bill, the red card issue being  the  involvement  or  not  of
foreigners in the industry. There was a time  during  deliberations  in  the
committee that the ANC was completely adamant that  under  no  circumstances
will foreigners be allowed any involvement whatsoever in the  industry,  not
even minority shareholding.

That attitude was completely puzzling, to say the least, as  major  overseas
companies have invested between R2 and R3 billion in this industry in  South
Africa. Telling them that they must sell and go was  always  going  to  send
the worst possible signals to investors from abroad.

The theory that some rich, crazy  overseas  persons  could  come  and  build
themselves a military organisation in South Africa, under  the  pretence  of
being a security company, never held much water, as  I  am  confident  there
are enough rich and crazy people in this country who are  capable  of  doing
exactly the same and who would, maybe, like to do so.

When one looks at the companies from abroad that have invested here  in  our
security industry, and the ones that  are  interested  in  still  doing  so,
there can be no doubt whatsoever that we are dealing  here  with  bona  fide
major companies who are clearly in it purely for business reasons.

Fortunately, some people in Cabinet saved the day for  us  in  this  regard,
and the ANC study group were called to order. We believe  that  one  of  the
better finance Ministers on the planet had a major  role  in  this.  We  are
extremely thankful and relieved that sanity has finally  prevailed  in  this
matter.

Now that the red card issue has been resolved, we  can  support  this  Bill,
although we have many reservations still,  and  subsequently  voted  against
several paragraphs at the committee  level.  The  Bill  covers  too  wide  a
spectrum of people  that  will  eventually  have  to  register  as  security
providers. A locksmith and any other person who  cuts  duplicate  keys  will
have to register, so too will the person in a shop who sells one a safe  and
explains to one how to operate it.  It  is  debatable  whether  it  was  the
initial intention of this Bill to include all these kinds of people.  It  is
an open question whether the authority will ever  have  the  money  for  the
bureaucracy that this could create.

Interpreted down to the letter, one could  eventually  have  half  of  South
Africa's population having to register as security  providers,  because  the
effect of this Bill is that, say, I go on holiday for three weeks and I  get
a relative or a friend to come and look after my house for that  period,  if
that person does it for any benefit or reward, it will mean that  they  will
have to register as a security provider. I cannot believe that it  was  ever
the intention of this Bill to include all those kinds of people.

The composition of  the  council  of  the  authority  is  very  problematic.
Although it has been improved to  an  extent,  so  that  the  Minister  will
appoint  the  council  in  consultation  with  Cabinet,   the   Bill   still
specifically prohibits industry representation on the council.

We are now sitting with the situation where the  security  industry  has  to
fund  the  security  authority,  but  is  prohibited  by  law  from   having
representation  on  the  council  of  that   authority,   taxation   without
representation, in other words. We simply cannot support this.

The chairperson of the committee, the hon Mr George, suggested just  now  in
his speech that the parties opposing this  particular  issue  did  not  come
with any suggestions, and I would like to submit that  that  is  simply  not
true. The IFP specifically proposed that the five-person council  should  be
increased to  an  eight-person  council  and  that  there  should  be  three
representatives from the security industry.

We even said that it would be in order if they did not have  voting  rights,
but that at least the industry should be given some  representation  on  the
council that they are expected to fund. So, what Mr George told  us  is  not
altogether true, and I do not believe that  that  particular  suggestion  of
ours was a suggestion which could not have been taken on board.

At one stage the Bill was going to ensure the employment  of  the  staff  of
the current security authority by the new  authority.  We  are  disappointed
that this has been removed from the Bill. We  still  believe  that  the  new
authority will have to be much bigger than  the  current  one  in  order  to
fulfil its mandate. Under the circumstances, we do  not  see  a  problem  in
securing the jobs of the staff of the current authority.
The last issue that we are concerned about is that of the  powers  that  the
authority is given to withdraw the  registration  certificates  of  security
providers, effectively closing their doors. We do not have a problem with  a
security company's doors  being  closed  pending  a  criminal  investigation
where prima facie evidence is presented. We do believe,  however,  that  the
authority's power to close the  doors  of  a  security  company  on  a  mere
authority investigation is excessive and dangerous in the  extreme.  We  are
also convinced that the powers  of  the  inspectors  of  the  authority  are
rather excessive.

Having said all the above, we will give this legislation the benefit of  the
doubt and  trust  that  it  will  generally  improve  the  private  security
industry, and not cause more problems than we already have in the industry.

Ms D M MOROBI: Chairperson, in the seven years of our young  democracy,  the
Government of South Africa has shown its commitment to justice for all.  Its
commitment ensures that  all  citizens  of  South  Africa,  irrespective  of
colour and creed, are entitled to the same rights - the right to  life,  the
right freely to choose an occupation, the right not to be deprived of  their
property and the right to peace, safety and security.

This bears testimony to the consistency of the ANC's constant  reference  to
the Freedom Charter, which states that ``there  shall  be  security''.  This
Bill before us intends to achieve and maintain a trustworthy, regulated  and
legitimate private security industry, of which all South  Africans  will  be
beneficiaries.

Focusing on the private security  industry  regulatory  authority,  we  must
emphasise that the aim here is  to  address  and  explain  the  need  for  a
regulatory authority that is completely independent from  the  industry.  In
the  past,  the  Security  Officers'  Interim  Board  consisted  mainly   of
representatives from within the industry. This  raised  concerns  about  the
board's ability to act as an independent regulatory body.  It  also  created
tension within the industry, as  board  members  who  run  private  security
companies posed  serious  concerns  around  conflicts  of  interest.  It  is
absolutely clear to all of us that one cannot be a referee and a  player  at
the same time. These problems necessitated a Bill aimed at regulating  South
Africa's  private  security  industry  and  protecting   the   public   from
unscrupulous fly-by-night firms.

The protection of the public interest  and  the  private  security  industry
itself is seen as the primary reason for the independent regulation of  this
industry. Those entrusted  with  the  regulation  of  the  private  security
industry must be persons without any connection with or vested  interest  in
the private security industry.

With this Bill we have an opportunity, as representatives of our people  and
as legislators, to disallow the potential for practices such  as  corruption
and conflict of interest. It provides us with a prime chance  to  move  away
from apartheid-style management and governance, where an industry  was  left
to its own devices, and could make or break its own rules without  any  fear
or intervention from the government, without corruption in its  ranks  being
exposed, investigated and prosecuted.

In line with the ANC's tough stand against  corruption  in  the  public  and
private sectors, the Bill before us  addresses  the  progressive  notion  of
disincentives for potential corruption, and it  is  an  important  one  too,
since it stresses the implicit independence of  the  regulatory  body.  Such
disincentives will begin to deter  immoral  or  illegal  acts,  as  we  take
charge of restoring the moral fibre of our society.

The main objectives of the authority are to regulate  the  private  security
industry, and to exercise effective control over the  practice  of  security
service providers, both in the public and national  interests,  and  in  the
interests of the private security industry itself.

The industry should operate in a professional, transparent  and  accountable
manner, and  should  promote  equality  and  accessibility.  We  expect  the
industry also to uphold the principles of democracy and the rule of law,  to
adhere to the principles of transformation and to be seen to  be  acting  in
both the national and public interests.  Accountability  should  take  place
through the regulatory authority.

The industry must advance and give concrete  expression  to  the  policy  of
black economic  empowerment,  to  ensure  the  advancement  of  persons  and
companies from previously  disadvantaged  communities  and  sectors  of  the
economy. The industry should not be seen to be acting  in  a  discriminatory
manner, which contravenes the principles of the Constitution of our  country
and other legal instruments.

The requirement of the Bill is that control of the industry be exercised  on
behalf of the public, through the body of the regulatory authority, as  well
as through the organs of the state. The  Minister  of  Safety  and  Security
shall have oversight authority over the  independent  regulatory  authority,
which is required to report to the Minister.

The council of the  independent  regulatory  authority  will  consist  of  a
chairperson, a deputy chairperson and three councillors, all  of  whom  will
be appointed by the Minister of Safety and Security,  in  consultation  with
Cabinet. Each of these persons must be in a  position  to  demonstrate  that
they have no connection whatsoever with the private security industry.  They
will be subjected to full clearance by the National Intelligence Agency.

The council may appoint one or more committees, consisting of  one  or  more
councillors or one or more persons, to assist the authority in  relation  to
matters referred to it by the council, and to report on the  matter  to  the
council.  Committees  may  be  established  by  the  council  to   represent
different sectors.  A  person  may  be  designated  by  the  council  to  be
chairperson of the committee, if the committee consists  of  more  than  one
person, and the council is not legally bound to  accept  any  recommendation
made by the said  committee,  in  terms  of  clause  13  of  the  Bill.  The
accounting records and annual financial statements of the  authorities  must
be audited by persons appointed by the council and should be  registered  in
terms of the Public Accountants and Auditors' Act 80 of 1991.

In closing, I would like to thank the  Secretariat,  Mr  Rasegatla  and  his
team, and Adv Louis Koch and his team. A word of praise  also  goes  to  the
chairperson, Comrade Mluleki George, for the way in  which  he  handled  the
portfolio committee meetings. Lastly, I would like to thank  the  ANC  study
group and members of the opposition parties, with whom we  differed,  agreed
to disagree, and then reached consensus and, ultimately  reached  our  goal.
[Applause.]

Adv A H GAUM: Chairperson, it is a pity that, despite the laudable aims  and
legitimate intentions of  this  Bill,  a  faction  in  the  ANC  decided  to
surround it with so much entangling controversy by  attempting  to  ban  all
foreign investment in the  industry.  This  sent  shock  waves  through  the
security industry and the investor  community,  the  aftereffects  of  which
will still be felt for a long time to come.  It  was  an  irresponsible  and
tragically short-sighted move, greatly damaging South Africa's image.

The reasons why the ANC embarked on this ill-considered  journey  are  still
not  clear.  Originally,  the  Chairperson  of  Committees  cited  increased
security worries after the 11 September attacks. When it became  very  clear
that this excuse would not fly, by mistake another  reason  -  possibly  the
true one - was given, namely empowerment. This  wishful  thinking  was  that
foreign owners could be bought out and replaced  by  South  African  owners.
However, it soon became clear that South African banks would  probably  lack
the capacity to provide all the necessary funds  and  this  would  mean  the
collapse of an industry worth billions of rands and  the  loss  of  tens  of
thousands of related jobs.

I can well imagine that the hon George and his  fellow  crusaders  initially
thought that this financial  difficulty  could  be  sidestepped  due  to  an
expected fall in the rand value of foreign-owned companies when the  threats
of the ban on foreign shareholding became fact.  As  investors  were  forced
out, the  shares  would  be  easy  pickings.  Unfortunately  for  them,  and
fortunately for the country, this possibility faded away  when  we  reminded
them of the bilateral agreement between the Government of South  Africa  and
Britain aimed at the  promotiom  and  protection  of  investments.  If  such
investments are put at risk  by  South  Africa  or  Britain,  the  agreement
requires compensation from the guilty  country,  amounting  to  the  genuine
value of the investment expropriated immediately  before  the  expropriation
became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier.

I believe that Minister Tshwete started backing off when this agreement  was
brought to his attention by  us  and  when  it  became  clear  to  him  that
Britain, rightly, would insist that South Africa  keep  to  this  agreement,
and would not allow him to make a nonsense of South  Africa's  international
obligations. Fortunately, Minister Tshwete eventually  came  to  his  senses
and forced the hand of the bewildered ANC portfolio  committee  members  who
had fought so vehemently for the proposal.  Ironically,  it  had  originated
from Minister Tshwete and his fellow cowboy and  cowgirl  comrades  such  as
Minister Penuell Maduna  and  the  hon  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs,
Nkosazana Zuma.

At the same time that President Thabo Mbeki and Ministers Trevor Manuel  and
Alec Erwin were visiting Japan to secure increased  future  investments  and
to convince the Japanese  that  our  country  was  a  safe  destination  for
business, the cowboys were wrecking those investments that had already  been
made. One cannot help but ask oneself whether the one hand  knows  what  the
other hand is doing in this Cabinet. Do the Ministers not talk or listen  to
one another?

There are further worries about the ANC's handling of this matter. While  we
advanced sound arguments in an endeavour  to  convince  portfolio  committee
members of the right course to take and to  persuade  them  that  they  were
horribly  off-track,  we  were  accused  of  acting  in  the  interests   of
foreigners and of not having trust in South Africans. I really believe  that
we cannot tolerate a situation in this Parliament where members accuse  each
other of being unpatriotic when, by trying to protect and encourage  foreign
direct investment, they were in fact acting in the interests  of  all  South
Africans. The DA has the interests of  all  the  people  at  heart  and  not
specific or foreign interests. I detest this kind of insult and really  hope
that it will cease. [Interjections.]

Apart from helping to terminate the ludicrous plan to chase away  investors,
we have also contributed,  through  constructive  engagement,  to  improving
various other aspects of the Bill. At  our  insistence,  the  definition  of
private investigator was watered down to ensure  that  auditors,  advocates,
attorneys and forensic scientists were  not  accidentally  required  by  the
Bill to register as security service providers. We  prevented  polygraphists
from being covered by the Bill. We managed to ensure  that  the  council  of
the regulatory authority is not only accountable to the Minister,  but  also
to Parliament, by requiring the council  to  table  a  copy  of  the  annual
report in Parliament and  to  present  further  reports  as  Parliament  may
request. We agreed upon a code of conduct  for  inspectors  to  ensure  that
their important and wide-ranging powers are not open  to  abuse.  These  are
examples - and there are many others  -  where,  through  our  thorough  and
committed work, we have accomplished improved legislation.

Tog is daar veral uiteindelik drie redes waarom ons nie die wetsontwerp  kan
steun nie. Eerstens, terwyl die ANC-lede aanvanklik met ons  saamgestem  het
dat slotmakers nie binne die reikwydte van die wetsontwerp  behoort  te  val
nie, hierdie lede, soos met heelwat ander kwessies, ook  hier  bollemakiesie
geslaan het. Ons dink egter  steeds  dat  dit  belaglik  is  om  slotmakers,
``locksmiths'', as sekuriteitsdiensverskaffers te beskou en  in  die  proses
aan  die  verreikende  regulering  van  hierdie  wetsontwerp  te  onderwerp.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[There are ultimately three reasons in  particular  why  we  cannot  support
this Bill. Firstly, whilst the ANC members initially  agreed  with  us  that
locksmiths should not fall within the ambit of this Bill, these members,  as
with many other issues, are now also turning a somersault  in  this  regard.
We still, however, think that  it  is  ludicrous  to  regard  locksmiths  as
security service providers and in the  process  subject  them  to  the  far-
reaching regulation of this Bill.]

Firstly, this is nothing less than overkill and will  negatively  impact  on
the small businessman who will now be subjected  to  stringent  regulations.
Secondly, we are also flabbergasted by  the  unwillingness  of  the  ANC  to
allow representation for employees and  employers  on  the  council  of  the
security industry's regulatory authority.

Nie eens Minister Asmal sal dit doen met sy rade  nie.  [Not  even  Minister
Asmal will do that with his councils.]

We cannot see how those who provide the funds for the authority  to  operate
can  be  disallowed  representation  on  its  council.  We  take  particular
interest in the fact that unions such as Cosatu can allow  the  ANC  to  get
away with this bizarre exclusion. If I remember correctly,  the  hon  George
said something about him not wanting unions to hold the council  to  ransom.
It seems as if the ANC is learning many lessons, because this Bill also  has
the unprecedented provision that the Minister may only allow  consultants  -
I want the hon Asmal to look into this matter  -  if  absolutely  necessary.
This is an invention of the hon George which, this time, is strongly  backed
by the DA. But we do believe that the hon George went too far  by  excluding
workers from the council.

Our third objection relates to the powers of the Minister, particularly  his
draconian power to issue directives to the  council  or  the  authority  and
even to assume responsibility for functions of the council or the  authority
if a so-called acceptable standard in the fulfilment of a  function  is  not
met. These kinds of interventionist provisions have become the  rule  rather
than the exception in recent legislation. It is unacceptable to us that  the
Government uses every opportunity to enable itself to intervene in areas  of
activity where it does not rightly belong.

The DA maintains that the private security industry  needs  to  be  properly
regulated. But we also stress, and we have done so for some time  now,  that
it is the failure of the Government to ensure the  safety  and  security  of
its citizens that has resulted in those that can afford it  turning  to  the
private sector for the protection of their  families  and  possessions.  The
large majority of South Africans cannot afford  private  security,  and  the
ANC Government is failing to equip the SAPS to do the  job.  Now  that  they
haved stopped trying to  chase  away  foreign  investors,  they  must  start
catching criminals.

In die finale instansie wil ek ook baie dankie sê aan ons regsadviseurs  wat
hier agter sit, vir die groot rol wat hulle gespeel  het  en  die  hulp  wat
hulle aan ons verleen. Ek dink werklik dat ons  portefeuljekomitee  tog  wel
besonder goed saamwerk. Die ANC laat ook die opposisie toe om standpunte  te
stel en dit ten minste te oordink en dan na ons terug te kom  daaroor,  soos
duidelik geblyk  het  ten  opsigte  van  verskillende  aspekte  van  hierdie
wetsontwerp. Dit is egter nie die ervaring wat  ek  gehad  het  in  Minister
Asmal se onderwyskomitee nie. In daardie geval het  'n  mens  ongelukkig  'n
situasie van mense wat nie werklik luister na ander standpunte  nie  en  wat
uiteindelik net doen wat hulle wil. Mnr Mluleki George moet bedank word  dat
dit nie die situasie is in die Komitee oor  Veiligheid  en  Sekuriteit  nie.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In the final instance I would also like to thank  our  legal  advisers  who
are sitting at the back here for the great role which they  played  and  for
the help they provided. I really think that  our  portfolio  committee  does
indeed co-operate exceptionally well. The ANC also allows the opposition  to
offer viewpoints and then at least considers them and comes back  to  us  on
them, as was clearly seen with regard  to  the  different  aspects  of  this
Bill. This is, however, not the  experience  I  had  with  Minister  Asmal's
education committee. In that case unfortunately one has  a  situation  where
people do not really listen to  other  people's  viewpoints  and  eventually
just do what they please. Mr Mluleki George should be thanked for  the  fact
that that is not the situation in the  Committee  on  Safety  and  Security.
[Applause.]]

Mr A M MAZIYA: Chairperson, Minister Tshwete, hon  Ministers,  hon  members,
representatives of the  department,  the  Secretariat  and  members  of  the
public, according to research conducted, the  need  for  regulation  of  the
private security  industry  is  universally  accepted  by  the  majority  of
stakeholders. This is not only within the industry, but also in  the  public
sector. A regulatory authority which is independent from  persons  who  have
an interest in the industry  was  found  to  be  the  most  appropriate  and
suitable vehicle for regulation.

Before I dwell much on this topic, I want to make one thing  clear  to  both
the industry and Parliament. Our position as the ANC in relation to  foreign
participation  is  very  clear.  It  is  our  belief   that   the   security
infiltration of any country is easy when  one  has  foreigners  involved  in
security  matters.  We  therefore  suggest  that  the  position  adopted  in
allowing foreign participation should be a matter that we will  continue  to
discuss,  unless  we  have  a  way  of  dealing  with  security  checks   of
foreigners.

The  decision  to  exclude  foreigners  from  the  industry  was  a  correct
decision. We have  weighed  our  security  interests  against  the  economic
interests of the country and we are of the view we will be able  to  balance
the two. I want to inform the Minister that this position is not  influenced
by any pressures. It is because of our long history  of  reasoning  that  we
were able to arrive at this decision.

The Bill makes  provision  for  the  establishment  of  a  private  security
industry regulatory authority to replace  the  existing  Security  Officers'
Interim Board. The role of this regulatory authority is not  merely  limited
to the protection of  the  public  against  unscrupulous  operators  in  the
industry.  It  is  extended  to  the  protection  of  state  interests,  the
protection of consumers and the protection of  the  occupation  of  security
service provider. The primary objective of the authority is to  provide  for
the regulation of the security industry and to  exercise  control  over  the
occupation of security service providers in the national interest, which  is
both the public and private interests in the security  industry.  A  council
consisting of persons who are independent of the private  security  industry
will govern the regulatory authority.

There have been  some  rumblings  that  the  industry,  the  union  and  the
community are not represented. Our view as the ANC is that it  is  not  only
people who pay subscriptions who are expected to participate  and  legislate
for the country. This Government must  be  responsible  for  regulating  and
ensuring that the  laws  of  the  country  are  respected,  irrespective  of
whether people participate. We  want  to  make  it  clear  that  we  have  a
mandate. Our mandate is to ensure that we govern and do so properly.

We would want  the  community  to  come  to  Parliament  and  share  in  our
deliberations. The authority will not be able to govern this  industry.  Our
expectations are to influence the industry and have it in  our  sights,  and
be involved in the day-to-day activities  of  the  authority.  Provision  is
therefore made for the industry and other  role-players  to  participate  at
various levels. Decisions will be arrived at at these levels and it will  be
possible for them to make inputs on how they need to be regulated.  We  feel
this is fair enough and adequate.

Provision is made in the Bill to  ensure  that  the  authority  is  able  to
achieve its objectives. These provisions relate, amongst others, to  members
of staff of the authority.  The  main  pillar  in  the  staff  component  is
inspectors. They form part  of  the  law  enforcement  division  within  the
authority. The  law  enforcement  division  is  the  primary  mechanism  for
monitoring compliance with the Bill  and  the  overall  enforcement  of  it.
These inspectors are tasked with the duty to carry out  inspections  of  the
affairs of the security service providers and to ensure that the  provisions
of the Bill are complied with.

Inspectors are given powers to enter premises occupied by  security  service
providers, or another person who employs security  officers,   for  purposes
of inspection. They can also search,  and  seize  any  record,  document  or
object which can serve  as  evidence  at  proceedings  of  improper  conduct
against that security service provider.

Considering concerns which have been alluded to  by  previous  speakers,  it
cannot be denied that the industry is quite  sensitive  and  must  be  dealt
with cautiously. The capacity of private security companies to procure  arms
and the concern that the industry might possibly contain some  elements  who
have a potential to engage in abuse, and the implications of such abuse  for
the security of the public, the state and the industry  itself,  are  a  few
indicators of the sensitive nature of this industry. It  is  on  this  basis
that the inspectors are given powers  of  arrest  in  instances  where  such
arrests will serve the purposes of this Bill.
There has been a lot of argument put  forward  against  these  powers.  Some
people argue that these powers are  excessive  and  need  not  be  given  to
inspectors. We are, however of the opinion that inspectors will  be  dealing
with security service providers who are potentially dangerous due  to  their
capacity to procure arms  and  the  involvement  of  some  private  security
companies in dishonest activities. There is also  the  potential  threat  it
poses to state security and the public, and  the  size  and  scope  of  this
industry. Therefore, it is imperative that inspectors be  properly  equipped
to execute their duties effectively.

However, these powers have  not  been  given  without  any  safeguards.  The
inspectors will function under the direction of the director,  who  will  in
turn  be  acting  under  the  direction  of  the  council.  The  council  is
accountable to the Minister, who  is  in  turn  accountable  to  Parliament.
These accountability structures ensure that there are sufficient checks  and
balances to guard against the abuse of power by the inspectors.

The Bill also makes provision for the drawing up of a code  of  conduct  for
inspectors. The code of conduct will contain rules relating to  the  minimum
standards of conduct to which the inspectors will be obliged  to  adhere  in
the exercise of any of their powers conferred on them by the Bill.  It  will
also provide the penalties for contravention of the  code.  We  in  the  ANC
believe  that  there  will  be  no  obstacles   to   the   enforcement   and
implementation of this Bill. Therefore, we support the Bill. [Applause.]

Ms A VAN WYK: Chairperson, the Bill before the House aims at  regulating  an
industry with an annual turnover of more than R12 billion, employing in  the
vicinity of 182 000 private security officers.

In  an  increasingly  crime-infested  environment,  private   citizens   and
business entrust this industry with their lives and property, and  they  pay
good money to do so. It is in the  public  interest  that  Government  takes
responsibility to ensure  that  this  industry  is  properly  regulated  and
controlled. The aim of this Bill is  not  to  stifle  the  industry  but  to
ensure that the public gets the service that they have paid  for,  and  that
the industry itself is protected against bad elements  that  appear  on  the
scene from time to time.

A very important reason why the industry  needs  proper  regulation  is  the
conditions of service of the employees. There  have  simply  been  too  many
reports of employers exploiting employees in this industry. Many  of  us  in
our  constituency  work  have  to  deal  with  security  officers  who   are
disgruntled and disillusioned. Not only is  this  exploitation  unacceptable
within the framework of our Constitution, but it also impacts negatively  on
the quality of service that the public receives.

History has clearly indicated to us that we cannot  leave  the  industry  to
regulate itself. The Security Officers' Interim Board was  characterised  by
infighting and accusations of prejudice against certain  companies,  and  it
lacked accountability. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  members,  no  cross-bench
conferencing, please.

Ms A VAN WYK: In 1999 the chairperson of the Portfolio Committee  on  Safety
and Security invited the board to engage with the  committee  regarding  its
work. It was only when we started the public process on the Bill  that  they
came to the party. We need to learn from the  past.  One  of  our  strongest
criticisms still remains that  the  Bill  excludes  the  industry  from  the
council.

However, we have indicated that we  would  like  to  see  the  inclusion  of
representatives of the industry and employees on the  council,  but  without
any voting power. It is clear that the industry cannot regulate itself,  but
there is no representation at all from the industry and that is also not  an
ideal situation. We call on  the  Minister  and  the  council,  once  it  is
appointed,  to  seek  industry  involvement  and  input.  There  are  enough
mechanisms in the Bill that allow for that. They just need  to  be  actively
pursued.

A great responsibility rests with council and its staff.  It  will  have  to
ensure  that  private  security  companies  and  private  security  officers
register. It will have to ensure that the training of security  officers  is
adequate and that training institutions are legitimate. We all remember  the
exposé on a number of so-called  training  institutions  that  issued  false
training certificates. This must stop. It not  only  endangers  the  public,
but  also  the  life  of  the  person   who   bought   this   qualification.
[Interjections.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, on a point of order: That is Ms  Van  Wyk  from
the UDM, not the New NP.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon member is referring  to
the screen denoting that Ms Van Wyk  belongs  to  the  New  NP,  and  he  is
correcting that. She belongs to the UDM.

Ms A VAN WYK: It will also become clear once we say whether we  support  the
Bill or not.

The council will have to ensure that the training of  security  officers  is
adequate and that training institutions are legitimate. We all remember  the
exposé on a number of so-called  training  institutions  that  issued  false
training certificates. This must stop. It not  only  endangers  the  public,
but also the life of the person who bought this qualification. This  is  the
responsibility of the new council.

The new council will have to ensure that the public knows about the role  of
the council and the services that the council provides. They need to  ensure
that they are accessible to every citizen who is making  use  of  a  private
security service. They will be the point that the public will turn  to,  not
only when they experience problems,  but  also  before  they  enter  into  a
contract with a private security company. It will be the council  that  will
have to give the assurance to the  public  that  they  are  dealing  with  a
legitimately registered company.

It will not be good enough to say, as the previous board did, that this  can
be checked on the website when nobody  knows  about  the  existence  of  the
website. The  new  council  will  have  to  embark  on  a  public  awareness
programme   reflecting   the   current   status   of   the   industry,   the
responsibilities and the security of the council.

I would also like to call  on  the  industry  to  co-operate  with  the  new
council. They must not see this as an obstacle in their way, but  rather  as
a tool that can improve their sometimes somewhat battered image. It is  only
those who are working with their own agendas that will have reason  to  fear
the Bill. The UDM will support the Bill. [Time expired.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Chairperson, the protection of  every  person's  right  to
life and security of the person, as well as the right not to be deprived  of
property,  is  fundamental  to  the  wellbeing  and  social   and   economic
development of every person.

It is the  responsibility  of  Government  to  ensure  that  the  rights  of
citizens to life, safety and security are protected,  and  to  punish  those
that undermine and violate such rights. It  is  an  indictment  against  any
government  for  citizens  to  turn  to  private  security   companies   for
protection while they are paying  taxes  to  a  government  that  should  be
protecting them from criminals. The increase of private  security  companies
in a country means that citizens have lost their  confidence  and  faith  in
the police that should be protecting them.  The  escalating  crime  in  this
country is forcing concerned  citizens  to  spend  more  on  their  security
because the Government has  failed  them.  As  a  result,  private  security
companies are mushrooming throughout the country,  and  hence  the  need  to
regulate this industry.

The ACDP fully supports the regulation of the private security  industry  in
our country, and therefore we will  support  this  Bill,  albeit  with  some
reservations. Although I was assured in the committee that  clauses  31  and
32 will not be abused,  and  will  also  not  result  in  individuals  using
security officers being victimised by the inspectors,  I  nevertheless  want
to register my concerns about the inclusion of the words ``any other  person
who employs a security officer'' in clauses 31 and 32, since this  may  have
unintended consequences.

I believe clauses 31 and 32 are  too  broad,  open  to  abuse  and  will  be
successfully challenged in the Constitutional Court. I still  maintain  that
it is not individuals who employ personal security  officers  or  bodyguards
who should be inspected by security service providers. The aim of  the  Bill
is not to target any businessman or politician who has a personal  assistant
looking after his or her security, or any  other  individual  who  may  need
that extra protection of a bodyguard.

I believe that it would be an infringement of our  constitutional  right  to
privacy  for  any  inspector  to  enter  and  search  any  private  home  or
individual whose only crime would be to  use  the  services  of  a  personal
security officer, without prior notice, as clauses 31 and 32(a)(1)  suggest.
We nevertheless trust that with the passing of this  Bill,  the  abuses  and
exploitations that are currently experienced by security guards will  become
something of the past. We will support the Bill.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, the original title of the Bill  was  ``Security
Industry Legislation Bill''. This title was  not  appropriate.  It  was  not
clear whether this was a reference to a Government or private body. The  PAC
welcomes the title ``Private Security Industry Regulation Bill''.

The security industry is  a  sensitive  matter.  When  infiltrated,  it  can
endanger a country and the very thing that it purports to  secure.  The  PAC
is unhappy that the Bill does not  forbid  foreigners  taking  part  in  the
private security industry. The industry risks being  infiltrated  by  agents
working to undermine this country's  security.  The  PAC  considers  this  a
sensitive industry, and it should be in the hands of the  citizens  of  this
country whose patriotism  is  not  in  doubt.  It  is  also  important  that
political power is translated into  economic  power.  Political  freedom  is
void without economic power.

The security industry is the kind of industry where local investors in  this
country should play an  important  role  and  thus  speed  up  the  economic
empowerment of African people, who are being  marginalised  economically  at
an alarming rate throughout the country. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members,  I  do  not  think
that members can hear the hon member. Order, please!

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, the PAC  goes  beyond  this  security  industry
issue. The PAC would like to see African governments formulating  a  foreign
investment policy. Africa is a market which offers high profits  to  foreign
investors. Capital owners in search of high profits do not always invest  in
industrial  sectors  which  strengthen  the  economic  fabric   of   African
countries. [Time expired.]

Mme M A MOLEBATSI: Modulasetulo, Ditona tse le maloko a a tlotlegang a  Ntlo
e, mokgatlo wa ANC ka moono wa Freedom Charter wa re, ke a o nopola:


  There shall be security and comfort ...

O  ya  go  sireletsa  baagi  ka  kakaretso  tota   le   ba   makokokganetso.
(Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[Ms M A  MOLEBATSI:  Chairperson,  members  of  this  honourable  House,  in
accordance with the sentiments expressed in the  Freedom  Charter,  the  ANC
says, and I quote:


  There shall be security and comfort ...

And we will protect all citizens, including members of opposition parties.]

Why the need for a new law? There  are  many  small  fly-by-night  types  of
security companies  that  provide  a  cheap,  substandard  service,  thereby
punishing the image and reputation of  the  industry  as  a  whole.  Through
proper regulation the likelihood of misconduct by members  of  the  security
industry or members violating or threatening the public's interests will  be
lowered significantly.

With the passing of the Security Officers Amendment Act of 1997,  Parliament
expressed clearly that regulatory reform of the  private  security  industry
was necessary. There are a number of key  provisions  of  the  amending  Act
that give expression to the need for a regulatory system. It is  clear  that
the existing Act has become  outdated,  especially  as  the  nature  of  the
industry has changed. There were also concerns that  the  industry  possibly
contained some elements which had the potential to engage  in  abuse,  given
the nature of activities conducted by some members of the industry,  not  to
mention the implications of such abuse for the security of the state.

The nature of the industry has changed significantly and  it  is  no  longer
confined solely to the guarding and protection of persons and premises.  The
regulation of the private security industry  is  necessary  to  protect  the
national interest. Furthermore,  there  are  also  significant  issues  with
respect to state sovereignty.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  members,  no  standing  in
the aisles.

Ms M A MOLEBATSI: South Africa is a sovereign state  with  a  democratically
elected Government. One of the key obligations of the Government is that  of
national security. National security is  in  itself  a  key  factor  in  the
realisation of the national interest and the objectives of  the  Government.
As such the state therefore cannot afford  to  contest  issues  of  national
security with the private security industry.

The private  security  industry  can  participate  in  matters  of  national
security only at the request of the state  and  on  a  very  limited  scale.
However,  this  involvement  in  issues   of   national   security   pertain
specifically to the sphere of crime prevention. Furthermore, the  nature  of
this competition should be such that it does not contradict  or  negate  the
sovereign mandate of the Government. It should rather  be  complementary  to
the national interest and to the objectives of the Government.

It should be noted that there  is  an  inherent  contradiction  between  the
interests of the private security industry and those  of  the  state.  While
the state aims to achieve a stable  and  secure  environment  in  which  all
threats to national  security  are  either  neutralised  or  contained,  the
private security industry thrives and grows in conditions in  which  threats
proliferate and manifest themselves in diverse forms.  As  such,  levels  of
crime should remain and a general sense  of  fear  should  prevail  for  the
private security industry to grow and thrive,  and  to  realise  significant
financial returns. It is this inherent  contradiction  which  underpins  the
need for and importance of the regulation of the  industry  and,  even  more
significantly, the independent regulation of the industry.

Regulation of the private security industry  is  necessary  to  protect  the
public's interest in respect of ensuring that,  firstly,  the  providers  of
security  deliver  a  professional  service  to  their  clients,   secondly,
employees of security companies are adequately  and  appropriately  trained,
and thirdly, no  member  of  the  private  security  industry  at  any  time
presents a danger to members of the public.

Furthermore, it must be noted that South Africa is  a  constitutional  state
in which the Constitution is the highest  law  of  the  land.  There  is  an
obligation on both the Government and society at large to uphold and  defend
the Constitution. The private security industry  has  acquired  capabilities
and is undertaking operations which may infringe on every person's right  to
privacy and, as such, infringe upon their constitutional right.

Their practices must be limited by regulation  so  as  to  ensure  that  the
right enshrined in the Constitution continues to be applied  and  protected.
Security organs of the state  are  subject  to  very  strict  measures  with
regard to their conduct in respect of their core business,  more  especially
in terms of dealing with ordinary members of society.

In conclusion, the private security industry plays a role in  the  country's
economy. The industry has to create employment, thus  reducing  the  effects
that unemployment  may  have  on  society  in  general.  The  industry  also
contributes to a reduction in the levels of crime  and  towards  infusing  a
sense of security for persons and property. The interests  of  the  industry
should, therefore, be protected through proper regulation. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, the establishment of  a  security  industry
regulatory authority will offer a great service in  terms  of  ensuring  and
overseeing  the  security  industry.   It   will   certainly   assist   with
transparency, efficiency and the effective running of the sector.

The broadening of defined categories  of  the  security  industry,  and  the
strict necessity for those that fall within this ambit to be  registered  or
deemed as practising illegally will provide a system that will  be  able  to
keep ahead of all matters within the industry,  but  will  also  ensure  the
proper incorporation of agencies that are often used by villains as  a  tool
to mastermind their operations.

Noting the wisdom of instituting such a body to oversee  the  industry,  the
hope exists that competent persons will be awarded positions to  uphold  its
aims. The code of conduct presented by the Minister  would  also  appear  to
assist in the proper running of the industry. There is fear,  however,  that
although the task of the authority appears to be to  the  advantage  of  the
industry the power awarded may be too  vast.  What  provisions  will  be  in
place to avoid the extravagant use or abuse of such  power?  Who,  in  turn,
will oversee the proper running of this authority?

Furthermore, what has happened to those bodies already in  place  to  secure
the smooth running of the industry? The issues  of  funding  and  the  broad
definition of ``industry'' should be examined a bit closer,  although  there
is this wise inculcation to introduce such provisions  to  manage  the  vast
and expensive security industry  that  operates  in  both  the  private  and
public sectors. The MF supports the  Private  Security  Industry  Regulation
Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, it is with a troubled mind that  I  take  part  in
this debate today. [Interjections.] I am serious today. The AEB tries to  be
constructive and positive. Personally I was quoted somewhere in a  newspaper
urging Afrikaners to be more positive, to work together for the  benefit  of
all South Africans. But, I must state clearly today that after what we  have
experienced during the debate on the  Palestine  issue,  I  have  my  doubts
whether it is all worthwhile.

Hardly ever have I experienced such animosity, such  a  clear  message  that
whatever we do, we will be contaminated forever. We can smile and  socialise
together,  but  as  soon  as  something  controversial  is  on  the  agenda,
something is cutting through to the core of  the  different  backgrounds  we
represent in this House and country. One  gets  the  impression  that  words
such as  ``nation-building'',  ``inclusivity''  and  ``reconciliation''  are
cheap talk. Today only proved to me that we still have a very  long  way  to
go, not only through what was said, but also the venom  and  animosity  with
which it was said.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member I have  allowed  you
quite a degree of latitude, I must call you back to the  topic  that  is  in
front of us.

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, back to the Bill is the next sentence, if  members
will only listen. The need for the regulation of the  security  industry  is
universally accepted by the majority of stakeholders  not  only  within  the
industry, but also in the public sector. This is also common practice  in  a
lot of countries. It is understandable that an  industry  that  can  have  a
force 50% larger than our own Police Force cannot be  left  unattended.  The
recent events in America also provide proof of this.
Die vraag bly natuurlik staan: Waarom is hierdie industrie so groot in Suid-
Afrika? Is dit nie 'n refleksie op die wyse waarop die Regering  sy  primêre
verantwoordelikheid, naamlik die veiligheid van sy  mense,  nakom  nie?  Die
AEB is dankbaar dat die kortsigtige voorneme om  buitelandse  beleggings  in
hierdie industrie te verbied, laat vaar is. Die skade wat dit aan ons  beeld
en ons ekonomie gedoen het, sal nog 'n ruk neem om te  genees.  Dit  is  ook
ons standpunt dat dit bisar is om sleutelmakers onder hierdie bedryf  in  te
sluit. Die AEB erken die noodsaak ... (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[The question, of course, remains: Why is this  industry  so  big  in  South
Africa? Is it not a reflection  on  the  way  in  which  the  Government  is
fulfilling its primary obligation, namely the safety of its people? The  AEB
is grateful that the shortsighted intention to  ban  foreign  investment  in
this industry has been abandoned. The damage this has caused  to  our  image
and our economy will take a while to mend. It is also  our  contention  that
the  exclusion  of  key  figures  in  this  industry  is  bizarre.  The  AEB
acknowledges the need ...]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  member,  your  time  has
expired.

Mr C AUCAMP: As gevolg van die magte  van  die  Minister  sal  ons  nie  dié
wetsontwerp kan steun nie. [Because of the powers of the Minister,  we  will
not be able to support this Bill.]

Mr M S BOOI: Chairperson, hon Minister, members of the  portfolio  committee
and my hon colleagues, today we are asked to pass a  particular  Bill  which
is very crucial to the lives of South Africans. It is a Bill that  is  going
to go a very long way towards stabilising some parts of  our  society.  But,
we must say that there has been quite a number of issues  that  were  raised
by a number of members, which we have been able to debate and  took  members
through within the portfolio committee. It is important and crucial  for  me
to respond to these issues, because I have  been  quite  vocal  on  some  of
these issues.
But, we must say that right through the  portfolio  committee  process,  the
ANC always said that we needed to find a balance  between  the  security  of
the country and the investors. There is no way that one can  compromise  the
security of the country only for investors, because as we have said, and  we
will continue to say, there is quite a number of lessons to be learnt and  a
lot of fear that has been created by the situation in America.

So, it is in the interests of  the  country  that  one  always  takes  one's
security as a priority. That is  why,  whenever  foreign  participation  has
been debated, the ANC has been saying give us the balance of how  they  want
us  to   protect   South   Africans,   the   citizens   of   this   country.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Carry on, hon member.

Mr M S BOOI: Chairperson, the opposition has not been  able  to  provide  us
with a solution. We are quite aware, and we are not wavering on  this,  that
globalisation is creeping in and over every aspect of life. And  within  the
security companies the market forces are  dominant.  Ten  years  ago  market
forces were not interested in private security companies.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Mr Abram, can we have  your
attention please?

Mr M S BOOI: Chairperson, private companies were not interested in the  past
10 years, but today the private security industry  is  listed  on  the  JSE.
Now, what does that prove? It quite clearly explains to us that  the  market
forces, though they  are  interested  in  profit,  are  the  ones  that  are
beginning to govern the security industry. I know all of those who  have  an
interest in protecting those people who, as Meshoe said, feel that they  are
embattled by crime. That is not what  the  debate  is  about.  What  we  are
saying is that those that are beginning to take over  the  market,  such  as
Fidelity Guard and Chubb, are clearly interested in making money within  the
security industry.

And we are asking: Should we not protect our own people  against  this  type
of crookery that is beginning to come in because it  has  an  impact?  There
are those that had businesses before 1994. Those  small  business  companies
that surfaced then, today one cannot find them. Khulani's are  growing  more
than anything and this is what the ANC has been saying.  We  cannot  protect
our people against private companies so that they can  be  able  to  find  a
role for themselves, but we must say it has been quite problematic.

It is just that Gaum is not here, because he continues to  insist  that  hon
members have not been able to reflect on what exactly is happening.  He  has
not  been  in  any  contact  with  the  Minister.  Everyone,  including  the
chairperson of this committee, has been interacting and  trying  to  find  a
solution. We were able to provide leadership. But, because Gaum  is  looking
for tension between Cabinet and Parliament, he is always trying  to  see  to
it that we as the portfolio committee, from the side of the  ANC,  have  not
been able to listen to our Cabinet Ministers. We are quite clear about  what
we want to do. We are quite clear that we  would  want  Parliament  to  have
strength within it. We know the role of Parliament and that is where we  are
sticking our guns. But at the end of the day what we are looking for is  how
to provide leadership on very crucial issues.

Aucamp has just moved away from here. He says there is no  leadership  being
provided. And we are saying that the chairperson of our portfolio  committee
has been providing leadership on a very crucial Bill, where there  has  been
corruption and third force involvement, and even  the  Goldstone  commission
indicated that there is corruption and third force involvement.

These are experiences that have  been  happening  within  South  Africa  and
building on that particular history, it is  quite  important  that  whenever
one is interacting and trying to find solutions, one is able   to  build  by
taking one's history, bringing one's past and building a better  future  for
oneself. There is no way that the present and the past  could  be  separated
just like that.
What I am saying is that Gaum has not been  able  to  understand  that  when
leadership is provided, it is because of one particular reason  -  how  does
one find the balance between the investors and the security,  because  there
is no way that one can compromise the security of our people  for  the  sake
of investors to flow in? In the past four to  seven  years  no  majority  of
investors has been flowing in the  way  we  have  been  promised.  And  that
experience is the one that we have been relating to.

And I continue to say that we do  not  blame  anybody.  If  we  could  blame
anybody, we would have loved to blame  the  DA,  and  more  specifically,  I
would have loved to blame the New NP, because they  have  already  spent  R1
million more to be able to kick out Marais. We  continue  asking  ourselves:
How much more do they want to spend to kick out Van  Schalkwyk,  because  he
is struggling to come to Parliament today? He is not  sitting  here,  he  is
not finding a job for himself, now they want to do that again.

I am just saying Gaum should be very careful of how he continues  to  relate
to these matters, because they are of interest  to  us  and  are  about  our
security. So, saying that we have not been listening to  the  Ministers,  it
is not like that; we will continue relating  positively  to  our  Ministers.
There is nothing wrong with that; it is within the law.

But, what we are saying is that Tony Leon has shown disrespect  to  his  own
party and people. They have gone down even to local  government  where  they
are meddling in the affairs of local government. They have messed  up.  When
we voted ...

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, on a point of order: When I  delivered  my  speech
you stopped me and said I should get back to the Bill. Can we ask  the  same
from this speaker?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Yes,  hon  member,  confine
yourself to the topic.

Mr M S BOOI: Chairperson, I am going back to my topic. It  is  just  that  I
know Aucamp is regretting today and he is not having a good day. But, it  is
not my duty to make his day.

However, what we are saying is that, with the involvement of  the  employers
and employees and Gaum in his desperation looking for members and trying  to
create a division within Cosatu and the ANC - that is not what this case  is
all about. We are saying  that  this  industry,  in  the  way  it  is  being
formulated, would always go and look for the best South  Africans  who  have
skills to be able to rise and run the industry properly.

There is no way that one could continue to say that  because  that  one  has
been appointed by the Minister, there must be somebody within  the  industry
who is going to come with his  constituency  and  hold  the  chairperson  to
ransom. We do not agree with  that.  We  are  saying  that  the  chairperson
should be allowed the authority to be able to run the  industry.  Allow  the
chairperson the authority to make decisions on how the industry  has  to  be
run.

There  is  no  way  that  we  could  allow  private  companies  to  continue
determining regulations and to  continue  saying  that  they  will  withdraw
their money if ever they do not get what they want.  This  is  what  we  are
trying to be against and this is why we are saying that we  have  done  this
presentation and have been able to  influence  the  situation.  So,  we  are
saying, let the authority be constituted by  credible  South  Africans  from
all walks of life, be they judges, politicians, or whoever is interested  in
running the industry. But the point is that they must not be held to  ransom
by certain private companies or unions, because unions are fragmented.

It is not only Cosatu that we should be talking about. There are  a  lot  of
unions that are involved in the industry. It is in  our  interests  that  we
should be able to protect the chairperson who will be having the  authority,
in whatever they might begin to do, so that one does not allow a person  who
has been appointed by the Minister to be told  by  somebody  else  that,  if
ever the chairperson does not do this and that, that person  will  call  his
union to come and  organise  a  strike  because  the  chairperson  does  not
register a particular company.

We are fully aware  and  informed,  as  we  are  standing  here,  about  the
involvement of different unions in the business sector. We are  saying  that
we should not create an authority that will continue to be held  to  ransom.
That is why we have been able to stick to our guns and say that we  are  not
going to allow that authority to be controlled by these types of people.  We
cannot open that loophole.

We are fairly aware that the business community they are talking about  says
we must be able to find ways of regulating them, because it is not only  one
businessperson that we  are  regulating.  We  are  regulating  a  number  of
businesspeople who have different interests. One needs to  provide  us  with
evidence to prove that these businesspeople are  homogeneous  and  that,  in
their homogeneity, they will be unanimous in whatever they will be  voicing.
We are saying that they should be careful, it  has  never  happened  in  any
society. It will not happen - unless they have scientific proof of  whatever
they want to bring to the table.

So, these are the bases on which the  ANC  has  been  saying  that  we  will
continue rejecting what they have been trying to insinuate, namely  that  we
are able to the reject unions and the involvement  of  other  people.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Mr Chairperson, hon members, the  first
point that I would like to make in my response to what has been said by  hon
members is to thank those members who have made very  constructive  comments
about what this Bill contains. I would particularly like to commend the  hon
Van Wyk and the hon Adv  Swart  for  their  constructive  approach  to  this
difficult problem of placing on the table a Bill like the one  in  front  of
us here, for the first time ever in the history of this country.

We anticipated, even as we were formulating the policy  document,  that  the
road we would be following was going to be one full of potholes, steeps  and
descents, and that it was never going to be a straight  one  altogether.  It
is in that spirit that I accept the criticisms that have been  made  by  the
people that I have mentioned.

I am deliberately not including in that category people like  Gaum  who  are
totally lost to the cause of good sense in this House.

An HON MEMBER: He is the hon Gaum!

The MINISTER: The hon Gaum is totally lost to the cause  of  good  sense  in
this House. He has made  a  number  of  wild  statements  and  talked  about
irrelevant things. He is still trapped in the oxwagon era of  cowboys.  That
is the favourite pet word on his lips time and time again.  [Interjections.]
There has been an indication, as has been said several  times,  that  he  is
not going to be talking of cowboys in the absence of crooks.  In  the  first
instance, that crook is himself. [Interjections.] He  has  shown  that  very
well. He has spent a lot of time talking about  how  the  ANC  component  in
that portfolio committee threatened foreign investments. That  is  an  issue
which has long since been resolved. Today, he is making it  the  centrepiece
of his address precisely because he has no sense of responsibility  at  all,
and there are no indications right now that he is going  to  grow  after  so
many years in this Parliament. [Interjections.]

The British High Commissioner handled this matter far  better  than  he  has
tried to handle it. The members of the private companies  from  abroad  with
whom we have had a series of discussions, together  with  other  members  of
the Cabinet, like the Minister of Defence and the Minister  of  Justice  and
Constitutional  Development,  have  handled  this  matter  in  a  far   more
responsible  and  patriotic  South  African   way   than   these   infantile
aberrations that we have been listening to today from the  hon  André  Gaum.
[Laughter.]

They understood this matter in a very  responsible  way  and  that  we  were
dealing with a very sensitive industry. They themselves made the point  that
the Government's concerns about how to  regulate  this  industry  were  well
understood by them. The issue of foreign investment  being  jeopardised  was
never at the top in their discussions.

They discussed the issue with us and  said  that  they  were  interested  in
involvement  in  the  security  industry  for  a  number  of  reasons.  They
explained the issues just like the High Commissioner was  explaining.  There
was never any issue of a binational commission being brought to the fore  or
the issue of the Minister of Finance or the Minister of Trade  and  Industry
being involved in those discussions.

The hon member is spinning all those things in his little  mind  because  he
is influenced by the situation in his own party, and  he  is  extending  the
political problem that they are having right now to other  areas.  There  is
nothing of that kind.  I  have  actually  commended  publicly,  in  a  press
conference, the way those British companies handled this matter.

I also want to commend the  hon  Adv  Swart  for  a  typical  South  African
response to the situation. He went on his own, like he was saying  here,  to
discuss the issues with the relevant people. He never  sought  the  kind  of
bankrupt publicity that that member wanted to boast of here today about  the
existence of the security industry. Thanks to Rev Meshoe for supporting  us.
[Interjections.] [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Alliance dissenting and Afrikaner Eenheidsbeweging abstaining).

                  DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITIES AND PRIVILEGES BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Chairperson, since the  promulgation
of the Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges  Act  in  1989,  South  Africa's
international relations - that is, diplomatic and consular relations -  grew
extensively, not only between states, but also with the United Nations,  its
numerous specialised agencies and other international organisations.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  members  who  are  leaving
the Chamber, would you please do so quietly and unobtrusively!

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER:  Since  1989,  when  the  Act  was  promulgated,  110
diplomatic missions and 46 consular offices had been  established  in  South
Africa, and  18  offices  of  international  organisations  and  specialised
agencies have also  been  opened.  With  the  extension  of  our  diplomatic
relations with states and organisations, it became clear that the  1989  Act
was totally inadequate and outdated.

Since  1994,  South  Africa  has  also  hosted  several  major   conferences
including the United Nations conferences. All of these conferences  required
the conferment of immunities and privileges to the participants. This is  an
aspect that was not provided for in the existing Act, and we were forced  to
follow  time-consuming   administrative   processes   to   confer   specific
immunities and privileges to the participants. In this regard, the  Act  was
in dire need of attention.

The  present  Act  was  also  found  to  be  in  non-compliance   with   our
international obligations. South Africa is a party to the Vienna  Convention
on Diplomatic Relations and to the Vienna Convention on Consular  Relations.
However, the present  Diplomatic  Immunities  and  Privileges  Act  of  1989
incorporates only some of the provisions of the Vienna conventions.

Recently,  Parliament  approved  South  Africa's  accession  to   the   1946
Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United  Nations  and  the
1947  Convention  on  the  Privileges  and  Immunities  of  the  Specialised
Agencies. In terms of these conventions, South Africa, as a  party  thereto,
is under an obligation to give legal effect to the provisions thereof.

Another major shortcoming of the present Act is the ad hoc manner  in  which
the granting of immunities and  privileges  to  international  organisations
and specialised agencies is done. This gives rise to a situation  where  not
all international organisations are treated in the same  manner.  This  lack
of uniformity in treatment makes the administration and  regulation  of  the
international organisations and specialised agencies in  South  Africa  very
problematic. Therefore, it is necessary to bring the Act in line with  South
Africa's  international  obligations  under  these  conventions.  It  became
abundantly clear that the present Act had to be  repealed  and  replaced  by
the proposed Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges Bill of 2001.

Extensive research into the position regarding the  granting  of  immunities
and privileges in other countries had been undertaken before  the  Bill  was
drafted. The proposed Bill  was  also  submitted  for  consultation  to  the
relevant national departments. These departments  all  indicated  that  they
had no objection to the Bill.

We will achieve four objectives through this Bill which will  enable  us  to
conduct our international relations in line with the accepted  international
rules and practices. These objectives  are:  firstly,  the  Bill  must  give
effect to South Africa's existing international obligations;  secondly,  the
Bill must synchronise the ad hoc practices that exist  at  present  when  it
comes to the regularisation of  international  organisations;  thirdly,  the
Bill must lessen the time-consuming administrative processes that  currently
hamper  the  effectiveness  of  the   administration   of   immunities   and
privileges; and fourthly,  the  Bill  must  deal  with  the  outdated  South
African legislation.

It is our contention that the proposed Diplomatic Immunities and  Privileges
Bill of 2001 that we are discussing here  today  will  finally  place  South
Africa in line  with  international  practice  concerning  the  granting  of
immunities  and  privileges  to  diplomatic  and  consular  missions,  their
members, to the United Nations and its specialised agencies,  and  to  other
international organisations.
Through  this  Bill,  South  Africa  will  also  have  complied   with   its
international obligations under the various conventions to  which  it  is  a
party and which prescribe the way in which immunities and privileges are  to
be conferred to the various subjects  of  international  law.  I  hope  that
there will be no objections to this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr C W EGLIN: Chairperson, the Bill was originally  introduced  by  the  hon
Minister as an amending Bill.  It  amended  the  Diplomatic  Immunities  and
Privileges Act  of  1989,  and  the  Diplomatic  Immunities  and  Privileges
Amendment Act of 1992, and added to them various  international  conventions
to which are referred. The original form has been introduced ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members,  I  do  not  think
that you are giving the speaker an opportunity to  be  heard.  And  I  think
that it is imperative that we should have a degree of order  in  the  House.
It is pointless my having to repeat time and again  that  the  House  should
come to order, and that you continue blatantly to ignore the request of  the
Chair. Even now, as the Chair is talking to you, you are continuing to  have
your own conversations.

Mr C W EGLIN: Chairperson, the original text, in the form  of  a  series  of
amendments, was difficult to  follow  and,  to  an  extent,  confusing.  The
portfolio committee sent the Bill back  for  redrafting  and  the  redrafted
Bill that is now before the House is a great  improvement.  We  now  have  a
straightforward 17-clause  new  Bill,  plus  four  schedules,  incorporating
international conventions that have already  been  ratified  by  Parliament,
and they are the Vienna Convention of 1961, 1963, and the Convention of  the
United Nations of 1946 and the Conventions on the Privileges and  Immunities
of the Specialised Agencies of 1947.

In addition to these conventions, there  is  clause  4,  which  enables  the
Government to enter into agreements and confer immunities and privileges  on
heads of state, special envoys and certain representatives of  other  states
and organisations. In addition, clause 7(2) enables the Minister  to  confer
immunities and privileges on persons and organisations  where  this,  and  I
quote: ``... is in the interest of the Republic''.

As a consequence of South Africa's decades of isolation from the  mainstream
of international organisations and their  activities,  conventions  relating
to the United Nations and to its specialised agencies  were  never  ratified
by the old Parliament and South African law was never  adjusted  to  reflect
them.

The  Bill  before  us,  with  its  annexed  conventions,  makes  fascinating
reading. It takes one to the other world  of  international  diplomacy  with
its do's and do nots, its privileges  and  responsibilities,  its  old-world
courtesies,  and  its  subtle  yet  firm  rules  for  managing   inter-state
diplomacy.

Let me just reflect on or two of these  clauses.  The  conventions  and  the
Bill together provide for the procedures for the establishing  of  embassies
and consulates, for  the  appointment  of  diplomatic  representatives,  for
regulating  their  staff,  for  determining  precedence  and  protocol.  The
privileges and immunities included are extensive. For instance,  the  Vienna
Convention makes the premises of a mission inviolable. Nobody from the  home
state can enter diplomatic or consulate premises without the  permission  of
the other country. It makes the archives of  the  documents  inviolable.  It
makes the  persons  inviolable.  No  diplomat  or  consul  official  may  be
arrested or detained.

What is more, the Vienna Convention says that the premises of a mission  are
exempted of all national,  regional,  municipal  dues  and  taxes.  What  is
interesting is that the loss  to  the  municipality  is  made  good  by  the
revenue for Parliament. Very few people are aware of this.

The Vienna Convention further says that a diplomatic agent  is  immune  from
criminal jurisdiction. He or she may not be arrested or detained. He or  she
is not obliged to give evidence as a witness.  He  or  she  is  immune  from
civil  and  administrative  jurisdiction,  except  in  respect  of   private
property, professional or personal activity.  However,  the  sending  state,
the state to which the diplomat belongs, may waive the immunity  in  respect
of that person. There are occasions where this has happened.

Secondly, our own Minister may withdraw  immunities  if  the  immunities  of
persons in South Africa are less  than  the  immunities  accorded  to  South
Africans who are representatives abroad. In order to protect  South  African
citizens who are precluded from instituting civil  proceedings  for  damages
against diplomatic agents, clause 13 states that  the  Minister  of  Foreign
Affairs must prescribe by regulation liability insurance requirements  which
have to be met by the persons. So, in fact, South African citizens at  least
have a claim on the insurance liability, even if they have no claim  against
that person.

We believe that this Bill is  necessary  in  order  to  cast  in  law  South
Africa's obligations in terms of the relevant covenants that Parliament  has
already ratified. The DP therefore supports the Bill.
Ms F HAJAIG: Chairperson, Deputy Minister and colleagues, I rise to  support
the Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges Bill. The democratisation of  South
Africa has created a historic opportunity  for  South  Africa  to  play  its
rightful role on the world stage for the first time in the  history  of  our
country. Indeed, what we have achieved is recognised  by  the  international
community as a model which serves as an example, not only  in  troubled  and
repressive parts of the world, but also in the havens of democracy.

We participate as equal partners in various multilateral forums such as  the
UN, the Nonaligned Movement, the  African  Union  and  so  forth.  Currently
South  Africa  has  diplomatic  relations  with  139  countries,   and   196
diplomatic and consulate missions  are  established  in  South  Africa.  Our
obligations  to  the   international   community   have   indeed   increased
significantly since 1994, and thus we need to have the tools to  ensure  the
safety, dignity and integrity of foreign nationals who  are  representatives
of their various governments when they are in our country.
This Bill  makes  provision  regarding  the  immunities  and  privileges  of
diplomatic missions and consular  posts  and  their  members,  of  heads  of
states, special envoys and certain representatives  of  the  United  Nations
and its specialised agencies, and other international organisations, and  of
certain other persons.

It also makes provision regarding immunities and  privileges  pertaining  to
international conferences and meetings. The previous  Diplomatic  Privileges
Acts  of  1989  and  1992  are  now  repealed  to  make  way  for  the  full
incorporation  of  the  Vienna  conventions  on  diplomatic   and   consular
relations, and further to incorporate  the  conventions  on  privileges  and
immunities of the United Nations and its specialised agencies.

South Africa regularly hosts international meetings and  conferences.  Where
the United Nations and its specialised agencies are involved, they  normally
require  that  specific  immunities  and  privileges,  as  set  out  in  the
conventions, are applied during such meetings to the participants.
With the passing of this Bill  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  will  be
authorised to confer such immunities and  privileges  to  foreign  nationals
and functional immunities to South Africans who are  employed  as  officials
of the United Nations and its specialised agencies.

All conferments must be published by notice in  the  Gazette.  The  Minister
must keep a register in which there must be  registered  the  names  of  all
persons who enjoy a) immunity from the civil and  criminal  jurisdiction  of
the courts of the Republic and b) immunities and  privileges  in  accordance
with the conventions. This register must be published once  a  year  in  the
Gazette. Reciprocal obligations must exist between the parties which  confer
and accept the privileges and immunities, that is, the extending  state  and
the accepting state.

What was the purpose of the Vienna  conventions  which  will  now  have  the
force of law in  our  country?  The  1961  convention's  preamble  says  the
following, and I quote:


  Recalling that peoples of all nations from ancient times have  recognised
  the status of diplomatic agents,


  Having in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of  the  United
  Nations concerning the sovereign equality of states, the  maintenance  of
  international peace and security, and the promotion of friendly relations
  among nations,


  Believing that an international  convention  on  diplomatic  intercourse,
  privileges and immunities would contribute to the development of friendly
  relations among nations, irrespective of their  differing  constitutional
  and social systems,


  Realising that the purpose of such privileges and immunities  is  not  to
  benefit individuals but  to  ensure  the  efficient  performance  of  the
  functions of diplomatic missions as representing states ...

The Vienna Convention has 52 articles  that  govern  the  behaviour  of  the
extending and receiving states in such a way  that  the  interests  of  both
states are  protected  and  people  can  work  creatively  without  fear  of
persecution or imprisonment. In all these conventions there  is  an  article
which spells out what  should  be  done  if  there  has  been  an  abuse  of
privilege.

Lastly, I would like to enumerate the various UN specialised agencies  which
are  governed  fully  or  in  part  by  the  UN   Convention,   namely   the
International Labour Organisation, the Food  and  Agriculture  Organisation,
the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organisation,   the   UN   Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation, the International Monetary  Fund,  the
International Bank for Reconstruction  and  Development,  the  World  Health
Organisation,   the    Universal    Postal    Union,    the    International
Telecommunications  Union,  the  International  Refugees  Organisation,  the
World   Meteorological   Organisation,   the   Intergovernmental    Maritime
Consultative  Organisation,  the  International  Finance  Corporation,   the
International  Development  Association,  the  Governing  Council   of   the
International Fund for Agricultural  Development  and,  lastly,  the  United
Industrial Development Organisation.

With the passing of this Bill South Africa will be in line with the rest  of
the world, providing  adequate  protection  for  the  diplomatic  community.
[Applause.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson ...

An HON MEMBER: Koos, jy moet mooi praat. [Koos, you must speak well.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Ek sal baie mooi praat,  hoor.  [I  shall  speak  very
well.]

An HON MEMBER: Dankie, Kosie. [Thank you, Kosie.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, the IFP  supports  the  Bill  before  the
House, and as we have heard the hon the Minister and two other  speakers  so
far eloquently explaining the background and objectives of the  Bill,  I  do
not aim to repeat their contributions.
Rather, I want to focus briefly on the outstanding work of the  UN  and  its
specialised agencies. The UN and  its  agencies,  such  as  the  World  Food
Programme, the UN  Development  Programme  and  the  High  Commissioner  for
Refugees, play a  vital  role  in  addressing  some  of  the  most  pressing
political, economic and social problems facing the world community.  Poverty
relief, relief from hunger, medicine, providing humanitarian  assistance  to
displaced peoples and putting an end to conflict are only some of the  areas
on which the UN is focusing.

Much of the UN's efforts are directed  towards  Africa,  a  continent  where
poverty, conflict and disease are rife. There are many historical  and  even
current reasons for the situation, but I  do  not  want  to  dwell  on  them
today. Rather, I want to argue that  our  African  reality  requires  us  to
recognise, now more than ever, that the continued  efforts  of  the  UN  are
vital to the long-term  improvement  of  the  quality  of  life  of  African
people.

We should therefore do everything in our power to make  it  easier  for  the
United Nations and its  specialised  agencies  to  operate  to  its  maximum
potential in Africa, particularly in South and Southern Africa.

It is therefore our wish that the Bill before us today will achieve  exactly
this, by streamlining administrative arrangements between South  Africa  and
the United Nations and its personnel and by removing bureaucratic  obstacles
that may frustrate the good work of the United Nations.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, because I still want to  go  and  watch  The
Magnificent Seven on television, which starts  at  seven,  I  will  be  very
brief. [Laughter.]

In terms of the Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges  Bill,  the  immunities
and privileges reserved for diplomatic personnel will  now  be  extended  to
certain representatives of the United Nations and its special agencies.  The
New NP supports the Bill because it relieves the department of  an  enormous
administrative burden in terms  of  procedures  to  be  followed  to  confer
immunities  and  privileges  on  participants  in  conferences  hosted,  for
example, by the UN. I think the recent conference on racism  is  a  case  in
point.

The Bill, inter alia, also enacts into law certain conventions such  as  the
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961. Now my question to the  hon
the Deputy Minister is: What other conventions have thus  far  been  enacted
into law,  more  specifically,  as  the  Fourth  Geneva  Convention  on  the
protection of civilian persons in times of war, and specifically Protocol  1
to this convention, which strictly forbids any attacks on  soft  targets  in
times of conflict, been enacted into law in South Africa?

Ek verstaan nie klousule 12 nie en ek hoop  die  Minister  sal  dit  aan  my
verduidelik. Dié klousule bepaal dat buitelandse  missies  wat  veranderings
aan  die  gebou  wil  aanbring  waarin  hulle  gehuisves  word,  skriftelike
toestemming van die direkteur-generaal moet kry. Ek  verstaan  dit  nie.  In
baie gevalle  koop  buitelandse  missies  eiendom  in  Suid-Afrika  vir  die
huisvesting van ambassades of  konsulate.  As  hulle  veranderings  aan  dié
geboue wil aanbring wat hul eiendom is, waarom moet  hulle  toestemming  van
die  Direkteur-generaal  van  die  Departement  van  Buitelandse  Sake  kry?
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I do not understand clause 12 and I hope that the Minister will explain  it
to me.  This  clause  provides  that  foreign  missions  wanting  to  effect
alterations to the building  in  which  they  are  accommodated  should  get
written permission from the Director-General. I do not understand  this.  In
many cases  foreign  missions  buy  property  in  South  Africa  to  provide
accommodation for embassies or consulates. If they want to make  alterations
to these buildings, which belong to them, why  should  they  get  permission
from the Director-General of the Department of Foreign Affairs?]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you,  hon  member!  I  hope  you
enjoy The Magnificent Seven. [Laughter.]
Mr M E MABETA: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister and members  of  Parliament,
this Bill amends the old Act as it relates  to  special  unit  agencies  and
other  organisations  operating   in   South   Africa.   It   includes   all
international protocols and thus aligns us with  all  the  conventions  that
were ratified.

Our Constitution requires us to enact these  conventions  into  law  because
they are applicable and therefore we, the UDM, fully supports  the  Bill  as
necessary.  The  proposed  Act  that  will  govern  diplomatic  offices  and
international conferences.  The  new  regulations  include  a  comprehensive
insurance which all  diplomatic  offices  must  take.  Further,  it  extends
liabilities to include enough insurance requirements to deal with  accidents
and criminal activities.

As our country embraces the challenges emanating from its pioneering  vision
and mission with regard to the African Renaissance  and  African  diplomatic
initiatives it is bound to enter  into  various  international  partnerships
and  agreements  with  other  states  and   nonstate   actors.   Inevitably,
representatives of these bodies will locate in South Africa,  and  therefore
this Bill makes the privileges and immunities they are entitled to  operable
in terms of our laws. This Bill  provides  an  operable  framework  for  the
protection of people engaged in partnerships  and  relationships  who  enter
into guarantees of  noninterference,  which  are  very  important  for  both
sides.

In conclusion, I would like to say thanks to those  who  struggled  for  our
status  in  the  international  community  of  free  people,  and   to   the
international community for the much-needed support  so  that  South  Africa
can view old Acts as inadequate and outdated. This  gives  credence  to  the
confidence that many South Africans have that we are  destined  to  play  an
important role  in  the  international  community.  And,  our  role  on  the
continent and in the world at large is bound to reflect  that  our  struggle
and the efforts of many who helped us through the United  Nations  were  not
pointless.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the MF acknowledges the  pressure  endured  by
and imposed upon South African diplomats around the  globe.  They  serve  to
represent and put forth our country  in  many  aspects  and  relations,  and
especially make their mark as global marketers in the scenes of  investment,
marketing and trade.

Noting the pressure  that  accompany  these  tasks,  it  would  be  wise  to
inculcate certain international diplomatic  protocols  into  our  system  of
law, as this Bill sets out to do. The clause clearly  expands  in  order  to
make available provisions for the  many  circumstances  that  our  diplomats
might  find  themselves  in,  and  in  turn  institute  a   more   compliant
relationship between South Africa and  the  globe  in  terms  of  diplomatic
norms and procedures.

The  adoption  of  certain  provisions  from  the  Vienna   Convention   and
Convention of the United Nations would be the way  to  achieve  this,  since
these host global influences.

The MF supports this Bill. [Applause.]
The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Chairperson and hon members, I  must
thank you for your unanimous support for this Bill. My only fear is that  it
might reflect that there are many potential ambassadors in  our  ranks  and,
therefore, everybody supported this Bill. I hope that that is not  true.  We
will answer some of the questions at a later stage. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

         INTERIM RATIONALISATION OF JURISDICTION OF HIGH COURTS BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The  DEPUTY   MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson, in terms of item 16 of Schedule 6 to  the  Constitution,  every
court existing when the Constitution took effect continues to  function  and
exercise jurisdiction in terms of the legislation applicable to it,  subject
to any amendment or repeal  of  that  legislation.  A  provincial  or  local
division of the Supreme Court of South  Africa  or  a  Supreme  Court  of  a
homeland becomes a  High  Court  without  any  alteration  to  its  area  of
jurisdiction, subject to any rationalisation.

All courts must be rationalised with  a  view  to  establishing  a  judicial
system that is suitable to the requirements of  the  Constitution,  and  the
Minister  responsible  for  the  administration  of  justice,  acting  after
consultation with the Judicial Services Commission,  must  manage  the  said
rationalisation. The principal object  of  the  Interim  Rationalisation  of
Jurisdiction of High Courts Bill is, therefore, to confer  on  the  Minister
the power to alter the area of jurisdiction of any High Court where this  is
necessary, after consultation with the Judicial Services Commission.

Before I conclude, I would like briefly to refer to the  comments  submitted
on the Bill by the hon Judge President Pickard of the Bisho High Court,  who
said the following:


  I regard the amendment as absolutely essential and something that  should
  be promoted in great haste in order to put an end to  numerous  wellknown
  problems and anomalies in the High Courts. I specifically wish to commend
  the approach that rationalisation of the High Courts is  a  comprehensive
  process which will require a considerable period of time to bring to  its
  conclusion and that the first steps in this regard cannot be  left  until
  all issues have been resolved.

Finally, I would like to thank the committee and the departmental  officials
for facilitating the passage of this Bill. I would now like to  propose  the
Bill to the House.

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

The House adjourned at 18:52.
