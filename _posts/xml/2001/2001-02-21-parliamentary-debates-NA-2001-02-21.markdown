                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF  FINANCE:  Madam  Speaker,  President  Thabo  Mbeki,  Deputy
President Jacob Zuma, Cabinet colleagues, hon members,  hon  MECs,  Governor
and Deputy Governors of the Reserve  Bank,  Your  Excellencies,  ambassadors
and high commissioners, distinguished guests, fellow South Africans, one  of
Africa's great poets, David Diop, writes:


  Africa tell me Africa
  Is this you this back that is bent
  This back that breaks under the weight of humiliation
  This back trembling with red scars
  And saying yes to the whip under the midday sun
  But a grave voice answers me
  Impetuous son, that tree young and strong
  That tree there
  In splendid loneliness amidst white faded flowers
  That is Africa your Africa
  That grows again patiently and obstinately
  And its fruits gradually acquire
  The bitter taste of liberty.

[Applause.] The bitter taste of liberty? Does the lemon always ripen  before
the sweet plum? Or do we have it in our power  to  determine  for  ourselves
the quality of the liberty we earn from struggle?

The Budget we table before this House today is the story of  an  irrevocable
and powerful transformation. It is the story of a nation  which  has  worked
without rest to build a new history for  its  children.  Like  Diop's  young
tree at the edge of the ancestral savannah, ours is a story of patience  and
obstinacy, of determination and hope, of activism, not atavistic  tolerance,
of choice, not fate. We have sought to remove  the  thorns  of  neglect  and
inhumanity, to restore pride and dignity, to lift  the  crushing  weight  of
poverty and disempowerment. We have sought to heal  the  scars  and  nurture
the tree. We have sought to show our children that  we  have  the  power  to
enjoy the sweet fruit of liberty. The Budget we table today is testimony  to
the success of our transformation policies.

These processes of transformation are not complete -  the  redress  of  past
impoverishment and injustice will take time. But they are firmly  rooted  in
our  society  and  economy.  We  can  now  embrace  a  more  confident   and
expansionary vision.  This  Budget  tells  the  story  of  the  choices  and
decisions we have made and which have advanced  the  transformation  of  our
country and its economy to the point where we can now  begin  to  enjoy  the
fruit. It tells the story of a young and proud democracy  hard  at  work  to
improve the lives of all its people.

The 2001 Budget  brings  to  this  House  the  fruit  of  the  macroeconomic
transition we have undergone. Our 1996  strategy  was  designed  to  achieve
stability, fiscal reprioritisation and consolidation  to  create  the  basis
for sustainable growth and development. It focused on reversing  the  growth
of debt, unsustainable deficits and the rising burden of interest  payments,
which threatened our young democracy. It  was  designed  to  ensure  that  a
greater share of resources went to key priority  areas  such  as  education,
health and social welfare targeted at the poor. It aimed to put the  economy
on a sound footing, improve competitiveness and strengthen access to  global
markets.  Today  we  can  say  that  macroeconomic  stability   and   fiscal
consolidation have been achieved and we  can  move  to  the  next  phase  of
economic reforms.
It is instructive to reflect on how different things might have  been.  Debt
service costs rose during the 1990s from 15% to over 20% of  the  Budget  in
1998-99, steadily eroding  the  resources  available  for  the  delivery  of
services. If the trend had continued the headlines for today's Budget  might
well have been: ``Interest on debt now R10 billion  more  than  spending  on
education and rising.'' But we reversed that trend. In  the  Budget  we  put
before this House we will spend R10 billion more on education than on  debt.
[Applause.] And by the third year of the Medium-Term Expenditure  Framework,
that figure will be R15 billion. Interest on debt in three years' time  will
have decreased to but 16,4% of consolidated spending.

 In order to reverse the rising debt  trend,  we  have  been  prudent  about
overall spending,  putting  the  emphasis  firmly  on  reprioritisation  and
better quality of expenditure. Now we can reinforce Public Service  delivery
without  threatening   fiscal   sustainability,   and   our   children   and
grandchildren can look forward to a future unencumbered by debt.

Eli  lixesha  lokuba  sonke  sixhamle   ubumnandi   beziqhamo   zenkululeko.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] [Now is the time for us to enjoy the sweet fruit of  liberty.
[Applause.]] We are saying that the tree bears not the bitter but the  sweet
fruit of liberty.

The Budget here today heralds the beginning of a new cycle. It  is  not  the
abandonment of anything. We have built a foundation, and the most menial  of
builders in the community will tell you that you cannot build  a  foundation
in one place and a house in another place. You build on the foundation  that
you have laid. [Applause.]

What this Budget does is to set out a  growth-oriented  agenda  of  improved
spending, significant increases in infrastructure  allocations  and  ongoing
tax reform within the sound framework of fiscal management established  over
the past five years. It signals a shift from macroeconomic stabilisation  to
microeconomic reform. And in the new format of  the  Estimates  of  National
Expenditure we are tabling  here  today,  we  signal  not  just  substantial
increases in spending allocations, but a new approach to accountability  and
management of the resources that this  House  will  appropriate  for  public
purposes.

International developments

Our economic prospects  are  inextricably  linked  to  developments  in  the
global economy. Global economic growth peaked in  the  first  half  of  last
year. There is now considerable uncertainty about  the  likely  severity  of
the slowdown in world growth and how long it will last. This will depend  in
part on the reaction of the economy of the United States of America  to  the
interest rate cuts effected earlier this year and monetary  developments  in
Europe and Japan. At this stage it is expected  that  growth  in  the  major
industrialised economies will be in  the  region  of  2,8%  for  this  year,
rising marginally to 3% next year.

The large current account imbalances in the US and  the  prospect  of  lower
growth in Europe mean that continued euro and US dollar  volatility  remains
a risk for the global economy.  Implications  for  South  Africa  and  other
small emerging economies are hard to assess.

Ours is more than just a cursory interest in the growth  statistics  of  the
global economy for this year. There are broader goals  we  share  with  many
other nations: to ensure that developing countries share  equitably  in  the
benefits of globalisation, to adopt  more  effective  collective  strategies
for  overcoming  the  scourge  of  poverty,  and  to  place   these   issues
prominently on the agenda of the multilateral  financial  institutions,  the
World Trade Organisation and  the  consultative  international  groups  with
which we engage.

At the annual meetings of the International  Monetary  Fund  and  the  World
Bank held in Prague in September last year we drew attention to  the  rising
threat that growing inequality poses for the  long-term  prosperity  of  the
global economy. We raised the importance of ensuring  that  the  commitments
made by the G7 nations to highly indebted poor countries should  be  met  in
full, and that more effective and secure aid flows need  to  accompany  debt
reduction.

Fair trade and access to markets are fundamental to sustainable  growth  and
development. It is shameful indeed that so many of the wealthiest  countries
in the world persist  with  barriers  to  trade  and  protective  subsidies,
effectively excluding millions of  producers  in  poor  countries  from  the
benefits of global trade. It is estimated that the  value  of  their  tariff
protection is something like US$1 billion a day now, which  is  larger  than
the combined GNP of all of the African continent. This  cannot  be  correct!
The  common  agricultural  policy  of  the  European   Union   and   similar
protectionist measures are exceedingly damaging  for  developing  countries.
It is now critical that the next multilateral trade round should  get  under
way, and should address these injustices decisively.

 As we have a  shared  interest  in  international  stability  and  economic
progress, we have to attend  to  the  governance  structures  through  which
international  reforms  are  pursued.  The   developing   countries,   which
constitute both clients of and shareholders in  the  International  Monetary
Fund and the World Bank, should have a greater voice in these  institutions.
We  will  continue  to  seek  a  common  ground  with   other   nations   in
democratising the institutions on  which  responsibility  for  international
collaboration rests.

On  our  own  continent,  President  Mbeki  and  Presidents   Obasanjo   and
Bouteflika  are  spearheading  a  partnership  which  will   bring   African
governments, the private sector and civil society together in new  ways,  as
we face our challenges honestly and seek to mobilise our own resources  more
effectively. The Millennium Africa Plan signals our  commitment  to  seeking
solutions that will stand the test of time, a way  forward  that  recognises
the inextricable links between democracy, resolving  conflict  and  building
the economy.

The President has just returned from Bamako in Mali this  morning  where  he
attended until late last night a meeting with other heads of state and  with
Mr James  Wolfensohn,  president  of  the  World  Bank,  and  Horst  Köhler,
managing director of the IMF, to discuss precisely  these  issues.  This  is
not a World Bank and IMF initiative, but an African  initiative  spearheaded
by three presidents involving the rest of  the  continent,  determining  the
pace and ensuring that we can lock in all of ourselves as  Africans  into  a
different set  of  outcomes.  [Applause.]  This  initiative  contributes  to
building a future of which our children can be proud.

We are saying: Re batla gore peo ya  kgololosego  e  re  beele  maungo  a  a
botshe [We want the seed of freedom to bear us sweet  fruit],  meaning  that
we want our children to  taste  not  the  bitter  but  the  sweet  fruit  of
liberty.

Macroeconomic performance

The economy grew by 3,0% last year. This was  the  fastest  rate  of  growth
since 1996. It was buoyed by a  strong  recovery  in  household  consumption
spending and an increase in exports of over 7% in real terms. Strong  growth
occurred  in  agriculture   and   in   several   specialised   manufacturing
industries, financial services and telecommunications. Over the  next  three
years, we expect growth to average 3,5% a  year,  underpinned  by  a  steady
recovery in  gross  fixed  capital  formation  and  continued  robust  trade
performance.

In the path we have followed  since  tabling  a  macroeconomic  strategy  in
1996, our focus has been firmly on building the foundations for  sustainable
long-term growth. Taking account of the global environment, economic  growth
is expected to continue strengthening across most sectors next year.

For improved long-term growth, we need to foster higher  levels  of  savings
and investment. Over the past year, the level of household  debt  has  eased
and Government  dissaving  has  been  reduced.  These  are  both  favourable
developments  in  turning  around  our  disappointing  saving   performance.
Several measures in this Budget, together with the  favourable  outlook  for
interest rates, will contribute to strengthening investment over  the  years
to come. Within the wider public sector, our restructuring  efforts  in  the
communications,  transport  and  energy  sectors  include  substantial   new
modernisation and capacity-building investments.

Inflation and exchange rate trends

Price stability is an important part of the  economic  landscape.  Inflation
erodes the purchasing power of  the  poorest  and  most  vulnerable  in  our
society. It introduces uncertainty into decision-making  and  colludes  with
debt to entrench poverty. It was for this reason that we decided  last  year
to set the SA Reserve Bank an inflation target of 3%  to  6%  for  the  year
2002.

Despite the sharp rise in  international  oil  prices  last  year,  consumer
price inflation in South Africa remained moderate. The rise  in  oil  prices
and the prices of imported goods led to an increase in  the  CPIX  inflation
measure, that is, consumer prices excluding mortgage interest, to  8,2%  for
the year to October last year. By December CPIX had fallen to  7,6%  and  we
expect a steady decline during the course of 2001.

These developments provide a strong indication of a structural reduction  in
the country's inflation pattern and the long-term downward inflation  trend.
Lower inflation expectations in turn have  contributed  to  the  decline  in
capital market  interest  rates.  Yields  on  medium-term  government  bonds
reached a seven-year low of  11,2%  just  a  few  days  ago.  Interest  rate
reductions in the United States and in Europe are also contributing  to  the
prospects for further easing of interest rates.

However, the rand came under considerable pressure last  year,  depreciating
by about 9,5% in real terms during the year. International  uncertainty  has
contributed to capital outflows  and  currency  weakness  in  many  emerging
markets in recent years. South Africa has actually adjusted  well  to  these
pressures, partly  because  we  have  deep  and  well-functioning  financial
markets. Over the year ahead the exchange value of the rand is  expected  to
stabilise.
International economic relations

Our economic restructuring has been particularly dramatic in our  engagement
with the international economy. Nongold merchandise exports rose from  11,5%
of GDP in 1990 to nearly 19% last year, testimony  to  the  success  of  our
trade policies  in  stimulating  exports  in  a  wide  range  of  industries
traditionally dominated by developed countries.  A  rising  contribution  is
also being made to our  export  earnings  by  tourism  and  related  service
sectors.

Despite the strong recovery of growth last year, the deficit on the  current
account of the balance of payments remained low - less than 0,5% of GDP.  In
the current international environment, where  financial  flows  to  emerging
markets remain both subdued and unstable, this  clearly  is  a  considerable
strength. South Africa experienced large swings  on  the  financial  account
last year: a deficit of nearly R6 billion in the first  half  of  the  year,
followed by a surplus of R10 billion between  July  and  December.  In  this
context the improvement in reserves recorded by the  Reserve  Bank  and,  in
particular, the  continued  reduction  in  the  uncovered  foreign  exchange
forward position of the bank  are  significant  achievements.  Against  this
background we are able to take several further steps towards the removal  of
controls on foreign exchange transactions.

The restructuring of our financial relations with the rest of the  world  in
recent years has been rapid. Both the bond and equities  markets  have  seen
substantial flows of  investment  from  abroad.  At  the  same  time,  South
African firms and individuals have diversified  their  investments,  raising
the level of foreign assets held from about 15% of GDP to  over  40%  today.
This  diversification  attracts  the  headlines  when  it   involves   major
corporate mergers or acquisitions, but it also contributes to  reducing  the
risks ordinary people face in  their  pension  funds  or  life  savings  and
broadening the markets within which our  industries  do  business.  Exchange
control liberalisation has played a role in promoting this diversification.

We have now reached a point where the foreign asset holdings  of  the  major
financial  institutions  are  reaching  levels  in  line  with   appropriate
prudential limits. With this in mind, the  current  limits  on  the  foreign
asset holdings of institutional investors are to be retained as  part  of  a
broader shift to prudential  regulation.  These  limits  are  15%  of  total
assets for long-term insurers, pension funds and fund managers, and  20%  of
total assets for unit trusts.

The institutional asset-swap mechanism has served a useful  purpose  in  the
past in facilitating a fairly rapid portfolio rebalancing after  many  years
of exclusion from foreign investment. However, it suffers  from  a  lack  of
transparency and is no longer  appropriate  in  the  context  of  normalised
diversification levels. The asset-swap mechanism pertaining to  institutions
is therefore to be terminated. However, institutions  will  continue  to  be
able to invest in foreign portfolio assets, up to the defined foreign  asset
limits, through cash transfers based  on  a  prescribed  percentage  of  the
previous year's net inflow of funds. Details will  be  provided  by  the  SA
Reserve Bank in a statement issued today.

The global expansion of South African firms holds significant  benefits  for
the  economy:  expanded  market  access,  increased  exports  and   improved
competitiveness. In order to support this expansion  from  a  South  African
base, the limit on the use of South African funds for new  approved  foreign
direct investment is increased from R50 million to R500 million. As part  of
Government's commitment to African economic recovery,  South  African  firms
will be permitted to utilise up to R750 million of local cash  holdings  for
new approved foreign direct investments in Africa. [Applause.] In  addition,
firms will continue to be able to use local cash holdings to finance  up  to
10% of the remaining investment outlay.

Shift from macroeconomic stabilisation to microeconomic reform

Ten einde ekonomiese groei te versnel sal ons verder moet gaan as die makro-
ekonomiese stabiliteit wat ons reeds bereik  het.  Hierdie  Begroting  bevat
dan ook 'n aantal fiskale beleidsmaatreëls ter  ondersteuning  van  sodanige
breë ekonomiese hervorming wat ons wil bereik - maatreëls wat die aantal  en
gehalte   van   beleggings   sal   laat   toeneem,   wat   werkskepping   en
vaardigheidsontwikkeling   sal   aanmoedig   asook   maatreëls    wat    die
doeltreffendheid  van  bate-aanwending   sal   verbeter.   (Translation   of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In order to accelerate economic growth, we will have  to  move  beyond  the
macroeconomic stability that we have  already  achieved.  This  Budget  also
contains a number  of  fiscal  policy  measures  in  support  of  the  broad
economic reforms which we seek - measures that will improve the  number  and
quality of investments,  encourage  job  creation  and  the  development  of
skills, as well as improve the effectiveness of asset utilisation.]

In support of investments we are proposing:


  -   A new tax incentive is proposed for companies embarking  on  approved
     strategic industrial projects.


  -   The tax depreciation rules applicable  to  small  businesses  in  the
     manufacturing sector will be favourably amended.


  -   Substantially increased allocations for capital spending by  national
     and provincial departments are proposed.

Our investment in people remains the cornerstone  of  our  long-term  growth
strategy.  Education,  health  and  welfare  services  remain  the   largest
functions in the consolidated budgets of national Government and  provinces.
The skills levy goes up from 0,5%  to  1%  of  payroll.  Already  27  sector
education and training authorities have been established and  we  expect  to
see a range of new learnership programmes get under way this year.  In  this
Budget a new wage incentive is  proposed  to  be  administered  through  the
income tax system.

In promoting more effective use of assets, several wide-ranging  initiatives
are in progress.


  -    The  restructuring  of  public  enterprises  will  reach  a  notable
     milestone this year with the initial public offer of shares in Telkom.


  -   The Treasury's Public-Private Partnership Unit now has 38 projects of
     both national and provincial departments under review, from  ecotourism
     parks and toll roads to hospital equipment and prison management.


  -   Perhaps most important of all, we have taken the first steps today in
     the Estimates of National Expenditure - it is a large document of about
     750 pages - to give effect to the requirement  of  the  Public  Finance
     Management  Act  that  by  the  2004  Budget,  the  main  divisions  of
     expenditure  appropriated  by  this  House  should  be  accompanied  by
     ``measurable  objectives'',  so  that  departments  are  properly  held
     accountable and their service delivery performance is  open  to  public
     scrutiny. [Applause.]

Improved economic performance is, of course, the outcome of a wider  set  of
public policies than those represented in  the  annual  Budget  papers.  The
initiatives of Cabinet colleagues in many diverse areas are as important:


  -   Promoting competition and appropriate regulatory oversight of  public
     utilities.


  -   Restructuring municipal governance so that household services can  be
     effectively managed and financed.


  -   Ensuring an appropriate balance between the rights of  employees  and
     market adaptability in the labour environment.


  -   Encouraging the research and technology advances that will  keep  our
     industries competitive.


  -   Extending land ownership and  agricultural  market  access  to  those
     historically denied these opportunities.

We do these things to ensure, as we say: Eli lixesha lokuba  sonke  sixhamle
ubumnandi beziqhamo zenkululeko. [Kwaqhwatywa.] [This is  the  time  for  us
all to enjoy  the  sweet  fruit  of  liberty.  [Applause.]]  For  those  not
familiar with Xhosa, we say that we do all these things so that we  may  all
taste the sweet fruit of liberty.

In these, amongst many other aspects of public policy, it is frequently  the
details of legislation, procedures, regulations  or  market  structure  that
are decisive if long-term growth and  competitiveness  are  to  be  assured.
Public-private partnerships can contribute significantly  to  the  extension
and quality of services,  for  example,  while  transferring  a  substantial
portion of project life risk to the private sector. However, these  benefits
are not automatic. They have to be earned by tough  performance  agreements,
appropriate pricing  rules  and  accounting  standards,  competitive  tender
processes, strong management of contracts, and an appropriate assignment  of
risk and rewards. In other words, we are saying you  cannot  just  outsource
and walk away from it. There are a lot of tough negotiations to ensure  that
the downside risks are shared by the private sector and that we can in  fact
ensure a better quality of service rendered at the best possible price.

Outcome of the 2000-01 Budget

Before outlining proposals for next year, a few remarks on  the  outcome  of
the 2000-01 Budget are in order. Revenue exceeded the main  Budget  estimate
by R7,7 billion in the budget year that ended  on  31  March  2000,  and  is
expected  to  outperform  the  Budget  this  year  by  about   R3   billion.
[Applause.] It seems as if hon members  here  are  not  too  happy  when  we
collect more taxes than we have planned! [Laughter.] Both  company  tax  and
secondary tax on companies are expected to exceed projections, as are value-
added tax and customs revenue. The revised revenue estimate for the  present
fiscal year is 7,5% more than last year's receipts.
Expenditure  in  1999-2000  was  R830  million  above  the  original  Budget
estimate - less than 0,5% - bringing the deficit down to R16,2  billion,  or
2,0% of GDP. This year, after taking account of appropriations  approved  in
the Adjustments Budget, expenditure is projected to be  R1,6  billion  above
the Main Estimate, bringing the budget deficit to R21,7  billion,  which  is
2,4% of GDP. We should  bear  in  mind  that  the  bulk  of  the  additional
expenditure this year has been  committed  to  flood-ravaged  infrastructure
resulting from the floods in the early part of last year.

The revised estimates indicate a saving of R304 million on state debt  costs
this  year.  At  this  stage,  departmental  savings  of  R1,7  billion  are
anticipated and disbursements of skills levy receipts  will  be  about  R430
million  less  than  budgeted.  These  funds  remain  earmarked  for  skills
development and will flow once sectoral and other programmes are in place.

Nationally and in the  provinces,  the  outcomes  for  the  past  two  years
indicate more careful budgeting and improved  spending  discipline,  to  the
credit of both Ministers and MECs and their accounting officers.

2001 Budget framework

We turn now to the framework and proposals for the 2001 Budget.  The  Budget
is always about finding a balance between several broad objectives:


  -   Providing  for  social  and  developmental  expenditure  to  overcome
     poverty and provide safety and security.


  -    Enhancing  investment  in  infrastructure  and  the  maintenance  of
     Government's capital stock.


  -   Reducing the overall burden of tax, so  as  to  lower  the  costs  of
     investment and job creation, and release household spending power.


  -   Stabilising the level of debt and  reducing  the  budget  deficit  to
     contribute to lower interest rates and fiscal sustainability.
I could have used the phrases ``on  the  one  hand,''  and  ``on  the  other
hand,'' but there are four issue we have had to measure up, so I should  say
``on the one hand and the other hand,'' and ``on the one leg and  the  other
leg,'' but those are the four issues we have considered.

This year,  the  balance  shifts  decidedly  towards  promoting  growth  and
strengthening investment.  The  Main  Budget  provides  for  expenditure  of
R258,3 billion in 2001/02, increasing to R297,5 billion in 2003/04.  Revenue
increases from R233,4 billion to R273,1 billion  over  the  same  period.  A
deficit of 2,5% of GDP  is  anticipated  on  the  Main  Budget  in  2001-02,
falling to 2,1% of GDP in the third  year  of  the  Medium-Term  Expenditure
Framework.

Including  social  security  funds  and  foreign   technical   co-operation,
consolidated national expenditure of R267,1 billion is projected  for  2001-
02, or 27,1% of GDP and 9,6% more than the  revised  estimate  for  2000-01.
The  revised  economic  outlook  allows  Government  to  increase  allocated
spending on public services by R10,2 billion in the  new  fiscal  year,  and
R16,0 billion in the year thereafter, above the  levels  that  we  projected
when  we  stood  here  last  year  to  table  the  Medium-Term   Expenditure
Framework.

These adjustments compensate for somewhat higher anticipated  inflation  and
raise real noninterest expenditure growth to  3,8%  a  year  over  the  next
three years. Provinces receive 56% of the  available  additional  resources,
national departments 38% and the local sphere 6%. Provision for  state  debt
commitments amounts to R48,1 billion in the first  year.  Interest  on  debt
was 5,5% of GDP in the year 1999-2000, and will fall to 4,4% of GDP  in  the
fiscal year ending on 31 March 2004. As in the past,  the  budget  framework
for the next three years includes a contingency reserve to allow for  future
uncertainty and unforeseeable spending commitments. An amount of R2  billion
is set aside in the first year, rising to R8 billion in 2003-04.

(Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Madam Speaker, Mr President and hon members, this Budget accommodates  four
very important proposals.

In the last four years we have managed to reduce the  state  debt.  Interest
on state debt has been reduced. Today we can see  that  indeed  perseverance
prevails. [Applause.]

Now,  we  have  funds  that  allow  for  more  schools  to  be  built,  road
construction and maintenance, more health care centres,  courts  and  police
stations and increased pension grants. [Applause.]

We also have some favourable income tax proposals. Personal income  tax  has
been reduced significantly for workers earning  low  wages  ...  [Applause.]
Paraffin will be reduced, diesel will be  reduced  ...  [Applause]  ...  and
companies will be encouraged to provide new job opportunities. [Applause.]

From this year new municipalities will have their  allocation  increased  so
as to allow them to provide certain free basic services. [Applause.]

All this contributes towards ensuring a better life for all  the  people  of
the country.]

Expenditure proposals

The revised budget framework allows for substantial  additions  to  baseline
projections for the next three years:


  -   Additional allocations of R16 billion are proposed for  provinces  to
     strengthen social service delivery and other priority needs.


  -   More than R4 billion is allocated to the criminal justice sector  for
     increased  personnel,  additional  vehicles  and  an  improved   salary
     dispensation for police. [Applause.] Is that all right?


  -    A  R7,8  billion   supplementary   infrastructure   investment   and
     maintenance programme is proposed, part of  which  will  go  to  repair
     flood damage in poor areas.


  -   More  than  R2  billion  will  go  to  key  administrative  services,
     including the SA Revenue Service, for improved tax  administration  and
     the Department of Home  Affairs  ...  [Interjections]  ...  sorry,  the
     Department of Foreign Affairs  ...  [Laughter]  ...  for  its  extended
     diplomatic responsibilities. Just checking, Shenge! [Laughter.]


  -   An additional R2,6 billion is proposed in support of local government
     restructuring and the delivery of basic services. [Applause.]

Details of the Main Budget spending proposals are  set  out  in  this  heavy
tome called the Estimates of National Expenditure, which  includes  relevant
policy developments and proposed outputs  and  service  delivery  indicators
for the programmes or main divisions of each Vote. Parliament is invited  to
agree to these proposals, as set out in the 2001 Appropriation Bill.

Supplementary allocations

The budget framework also accommodates several spending  proposals  not  yet
allocated to departmental Votes:


  -   A further R85 million  in  2001-02  and  R100  million  in  the  year
     thereafter for repairs  to  flood-damaged  infrastructure  of  national
     departments.


  -    R1,2  billion  for  rehabilitation   of   flood-damaged   provincial
     infrastructure, of which R600 million is expected to be  spent  in  the
     new fiscal year.


  -   R120 million in  2001-02  for  short-term  poverty  relief  measures,
     including interventions in response to cholera outbreaks.


  -   Amounts of R300 million in 2002-03 and R313,5  million  in  the  year
     thereafter for targeted HIV/Aids interventions.


  -   An amount of R3,75 billion  for  provincial  infrastructure  spending
     over the next three years - road construction and  maintenance,  school
     building, hospitals and clinics and rural development. [Applause.]


  -   R2,5 billion for infrastructure projects of national departments over
     the next three years.

Spending in 2001-02 from these supplementary allocations will be brought  to
the Assembly in the Adjustments Estimate, once likely project  disbursements
have been finalised.

Of the supplementary amounts available  to  national  departments  over  the
next three years for infrastructure:


  -   R863 million is set aside for police stations,  courts  and  prisons.
     Clearly, I am trying to get on the  right  side  of  Minister  Tshwete!
     [Laughter.]


  -   R580 million  will  go  to  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects,
     particularly in areas affected by cholera. [Applause.]


  -   R390 million  is  for  key  infrastructure  projects  in  support  of
     industrial development.


  -   R100 million is for the refurbishment of SA Rail Commuter Corporation
     rolling stock.


  -   R50 million will go to complete the new Lubombo road linking northern
     Kwazulu-Natal, Swaziland and Mozambique. [Applause.]


  -   R80 million is  allocated  for  the  development  of  emergency  call
     centres by the Department of Communications.

Spending policy objectives

In  formulating  spending  plans  for  the  2001   Medium-Term   Expenditure
Framework, Government has  sought  to  balance  a  number  of  broad  policy
objectives:


  -   Economic growth


  -   Job creation


  -   Equity and social development


  -   Strengthening the safety and justice sector

Promoting growth and employment

By setting aside  substantial  supplementary  resources  for  infrastructure
investment and maintenance, we seek  to  broaden  access  to  opportunities,
lower the costs of transport and communications, and  improve  standards  of
living in poor  communities.  In  implementing  this  investment  programme,
Government will also  contribute  directly  to  the  creation  of  jobs.  In
addition, R1,5 billion a year is being allocated  to  a  range  of  targeted
poverty relief programmes,  many  of  which  contribute  to  employment  and
construction in support of local economic development.

Government's rural development, land reform and  agricultural  policies  are
also designed  to  reduce  rural  poverty  by  supporting  access  to  land,
investing in rural infrastructure and broadening access to markets.  Poverty
reduction priorities are evident in the provision of resources to  subsidise
basic services. Funds for  low-cost  housing  and  subsidisation  of  public
transport reduce the costs of  these  household  requirements.  Government's
approach to  financing  local  government  and  pricing  of  basic  services
recognises  that  some  municipal  services  should  be  available  to  poor
households free of charge.

Social development

The social services - education, health and welfare - take up about  58%  of
the consolidated national and provincial noninterest allocations,  and  will
grow steadily over  the  MTEF  period.  The  largest  single  redistributive
programme of  Government  is  the  system  of  social  grants  delivered  by
provincial welfare departments. These include the old  age,  disability  and
child support grants and provide  support  to  more  than  3  million  South
Africans every month.

Kulo nyaka izimpesheni zabadala nezabakhubazekile  zikhushuliwe  kusuka  ku-
R540 ngenyanga kuya ku-R570 kusukela mhla  ka-1  Julayi.  [Ihlombe.]  Nemali
yokondla izingane ikhuphukile  ukusuka  kwi-R100  kuya  kwi-R110  ngenyanga.
[Ihlombe.]

Eminyakeni emithathu ezayo lezi zimali zizokhuphuka  ngokuhambisana  nezinga
lokwehla kwamandla emali. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[On 1 July 2001 old age pensions  will  be  increased  from  R540  to  R570.
[Applause.] Even the child support grant will  be  increased  from  R100  to
R110 a month. [Applause.] Over three years these moneys  will  be  increased
in proportion to the inflation rate at the time.]

Wat ons sê, is dat die maksimum toelae vir  bejaarde  en  gestremde  persone
met ingang van 1 Julie vanaf R540 na R570 per maand  verhoog  word,  en  die
kinderonderhoudstoelae sal van R100 na R110 per maand verhoog word.  Hierdie
toelaes sal oor die volgende drie jaar  met  ten  minste  die  inflasiekoers
aangepas word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[What we are saying is that with effect from 1 July the  maximum  grant  for
elderly and disabled people will be increased from R540 to R570  per  month,
and that the child support grant will be increased from  R100  to  R110  per
month. Over the next three years these grants will be adjusted by  at  least
the inflation rate.]

The maximum old age and disability grants will increase from R540 to R570  a
month in July this year, and the child  support  grant  will  increase  from
R100 to R110 a month. The MTEF allows for inflation-related  adjustments  to
social grants in subsequent years.

Justice and protection services

This Budget recognises that the services of the  integrated  justice  sector
are critical to the quality of life of  all  our  people.  Raising  spending
capacity  and  improving  its  quality  in  the  justice  system  are  clear
priorities of Government.  Additional  allocations  go  to  the  Safety  and
Security Vote in support of the restructuring of its  specialist  units  and
the strengthening of operational activities at  police  stations  throughout
the country. The more streamlined  operation  of  the  Legal  Aid  Board  is
recognised in its increased funding level  and  additional  allocations  are
made for the prosecution service and special investigations.

Members of this  House  will  know  that  we  have  unfinished  business  in
relation  to  the  recommendations  on  reparations   of   the   Truth   and
Reconciliation Commission.  Allocations  to  the  President's  Fund  on  the
Justice and  Constitutional  Development  Vote  for  2001-02  and  the  year
thereafter will bring the amount available for final  reparations  to  about
R800 million. These will be paid in  once-off  settlements  and  the  Budget
allows the programme to be concluded over the next two years.

Measuring improved service delivery

Once-off allocations are also being  made  on  the  Statistics  SA  Vote  to
provide for the 2001 census, and I would  like  to  take  this  opportunity,
echoing the President's words of last week, to ask  all  South  Africans  to
participate voluntarily in Census 2001 to be conducted in  October  of  this
year to ensure that we can more accurately know the profile of South  Africa
and its people and be able to target resources in that  direction.  This  in
itself is an important step in developing our capacity to  measure  progress
in the social and economic challenges this Budget seeks to address.

Changing the way in which Government operates is a key element  of  improved
service delivery and better value for money in the  purchase  of  goods  and
services  outlined  in  the  Budget.  Improving   service   delivery   means
confronting poor management:


  -    Getting  teachers  to  teach  with  enthusiasm   is   partly   about
     strengthening discipline  in  the  classroom,  but  it  is  also  about
     diligence in the school district office.


  -   Reinforcing the ethic of care  and  compassion  in  our  clinics  and
     hospital wards is also about combating theft of medicines and  imposing
     a cost-effective laundry or building maintenance regime. [Applause.]


  -   Respect for the rights of both the victims and the accused means that
     court backlogs must  be  shortened  and  the  criminal  justice  system
     modernised.

The 2001 Budget substantially increases the resources available  for  Public
Service delivery over the next three years. It does so without fear  of  the
crushing burden of debt. And, in doing so, it challenges us  to  focus  more
keenly on ensuring that the funds we appropriate impact on  the  quality  of
people's lives: that more infants live past their first birthday, that  more
children pass successfully through our schools, that our roads become  safer
and that every family should have access to clean water. [Applause.]

The form and content of the new Estimates  of  National  Expenditure  invite
all of us in this House and all South Africans to be  vigilant  in  ensuring
that we meet the goals we set ourselves.

And we do so to ensure that the tree bears not  the  bitter  but  the  sweet
fruit of liberty, or as we say: Gore peo ya kgololosego e re beele  maung  a
a botshe. [So that the seed of freedom bears us sweet fruit.]

Provincial and local government finance

Improved provincial finances

Turning to  provincial  and  local  government  finances,  our  Constitution
provides for three spheres of government. For the tree to  grow  strong  all
three branches have to be healthy.

The equitable share to provinces rises by 7,7% a year  for  the  next  three
years, providing for significant real growth in critical spending.  This  is
supplemented by a variety of grants, bringing the total provincial share  of
noninterest allocations on the national Budget to 56,4% in the new year.

Provincial governments have made striking progress  in  improving  financial
management. It is easy to forget now that in  1997  a  number  of  provinces
faced serious financial difficulties. The overdraft problems in the  Eastern
Cape and KwaZulu-Natal have been dealt with,  and  the  need  to  set  aside
funds to deal with  the  debt  overhang  is  no  longer  holding  provincial
spending plans back. [Applause.] In Gauteng alone, over R1 billion has  been
reserved for major capital projects, and in all  provinces  the  next  three
years will see  growth  in  both  the  main  social  services  and  targeted
investments in social and economic infrastructure.
The sound state of provincial finances is testimony  to  the  commitment  of
the Budget Council to working together as a team. With patience and  clarity
of vision, much can be achieved, even over a three-year  time  horizon.  The
nine MECs of finance will sit next to one  another,  and,  again,  we  would
like to commend them for that sterling effort. [Applause.]

Local government challenges

For local government, the challenges of transformation  largely  lie  ahead.
We have to merge different local authorities with diverse  needs,  financial
systems and  procedures,  and  we  must  build  a  new  ethos  of  financial
responsibility.  As  Team  Finance,  we  stand  ready  to  work  with  local
government to manage this complex and challenging transition. The aim is  to
nurture this branch, so that the whole tree can bear sweeter fruit.

Local government is responsible for providing many basic  services  such  as
water,  electricity,  sanitation,  refuse  collection  and  basic  household
infrastructure, all of which impact directly on the  lives  of  people.  The
local government elections in December last year marked  the  completion  of
the process of rationalising the number of municipalities from 843  to  284,
laying the foundations for the emergence  of  better-managed  and  delivery-
focused organisations. The process of merging municipalities will take  time
to complete. The financial viability of some municipalities  is  not  secure
at this stage, and the pressing need to provide universal  access  to  basic
municipal services remains.

However, our metropolitan and bigger cities have considerable  capacity  and
have already taken significant  steps  on  the  road  to  stabilising  their
finances. This can be seen in the transformation of Johannesburg,  which  is
moving away from crisis management and beginning to find the  resources  for
capital  spending  once  again.  It  can  be  seen  in  Durban,   which   is
demonstrating how to provide free basic services like water to the poor.

To support municipalities in addressing  the  challenge  of  providing  free
basic services, the national Government is increasing  the  equitable  share
to  local  government  significantly.  The  allocation  now  rises  to  R2,6
billion, and is projected to increase to R3,6 billion  over  the  period  to
2004. This represents an average annual increase of  11%  over  the  period.
The  equitable  share  formula  favours  poor  municipalities  with  limited
revenue-raising capacity.

But that is only part of the story. Total revenues to local government  rise
from R6,5 billion in  2001-02  to  R7,8  billion  in  2003-04.  These  funds
include R2,2 billion in allocations specifically for the extension of  basic
municipal infrastructure to poor households.

The primary source of financing for local  government  remains  local  taxes
and other  revenues  levied  and  collected  by  municipalities  themselves,
including property taxes, levies and user charges. The equitable  share  and
other transfers that go to local government supplement  these  revenues  and
are targeted at the poorest municipalities whose local tax base is limited.

The  additional   allocations   to   municipalities   and   the   provincial
infrastructure grants underpin Government's commitment to urban renewal  and
integrated rural development. Municipalities in the nodal points  identified
by the President in his state of the nation  address  will,  for  the  first
time, be able to budget for the full extent of resources at their  disposal,
and provide national and provincial departments with a focal point  for  the
co-ordination of development  projects.  Moreover,  the  improved  reporting
systems proposed in the Division of Revenue Bill that we are  tabling  today
will enable all spheres of  government  regularly  to  monitor  progress  in
these nodal points.

It is important, however, not to think  of  the  challenges  ahead  only  in
fiscal or  monetary  terms.  There  is  a  larger  challenge  of  developing
capacity and governance systems, for which I am sure  Minister  Mufamadi  is
gearing up more strongly. Improving the credibility  of  municipal  budgets,
adapting strategies to  meet  local  needs  and  enhancing  the  quality  of
service delivery within affordable bounds are immense projects.

We must think of innovative ways of  strengthening  the  capacity  of  local
government and tap into experiences elsewhere in the world.  An  example  of
this is a project that the World Bank is running with about  150  mayors  of
cities and towns in Latin America who meet in Internet  conversations  every
Saturday morning to deal with a whole series of  issues  relating  to  local
government - from how to collect taxes, how to  provide  refuse  collection,
how to ensure that they spend on infrastructure, to running  efficient  fire
brigades. All of these kinds of experiences are shared - not inputed by  the
World Bank - but shared among these  mayors  who  meet  in  this  way  every
Saturday morning, sitting in their respective offices  in  their  respective
cities. It is this kind of experience that we need to draw on to  build  the
capacity that will make a difference, because local government  touches  our
people in a very direct way.
Revenue issues and tax proposals

Over  the  past  five  years,  considerable  attention  has  been  given  to
improving the structure of the South African tax system and  the  system  of
revenue administration,  which  are  critical  to  Government's  fiscal  and
macroeconomic policy initiatives. The income tax changes introduced  in  the
Budget last year were the cornerstone of a general tax reform  process  that
enhances the equity, efficiency and  international  competitiveness  of  the
South African tax system. These are important building blocks  on  the  path
to sustainable  economic  development  and  a  better  life  for  all  South
Africans.

Since  1995,  personal  and  corporate  income  taxes  have   been   reduced
significantly. Before this year's tax proposals,  we  had  put  R25  billion
back into the pockets of South Africans. Today, we are giving more  back.  A
further R8,3 billion in personal income  tax  relief  is  being  devoted  to
ensuring  that  all  South  Africans  share  in  the  successes  of   fiscal
discipline we have achieved. [Applause.] But, perhaps more  importantly,  we
are making good on the  pledge  we  have  made  here  before,  a  pledge  to
taxpayers: ``Pay  your  taxes  now,  and  everyone  will  pay  less  in  the
future.'' [Applause.]

The package of tax reforms announced here complements other economic  reform
initiatives  by  releasing  fiscal  resources   for   investment,   economic
development and job creation.

(Translation of Setswana paragraphs follows.)

[Income tax for workers earning below R80 000  a  year  will  be  decreased.
Workers who earn below R23 000  a  year  will  no  longer  pay  income  tax.
[Applause.] A worker who earns R70 000 a year will receive a return of  R140
a month. [Applause.]

Additional tax on paraffin will be decreased by 40c a litre.  This  decrease
will help the poorest of the poor. [Applause.]

A tax decrease will be effected for independent small businesses, so  as  to
lighten the production costs of their  particular  products.  A  low  income
increase will be effected as of 1 October 2001, to help job creation.

The price of diesel, which is used by farmers, will be decreased  by  42c  a
litre as from 4 July 2001. [Applause.]]

Regarding the income tax proposals, personal income  tax  reductions  accrue
mainly to workers earning below R80 000 a year and  improve  the  equity  of
the overall tax system. This  has  been  achieved  by  raising  the  primary
rebate by 8,9% and changing the tax  brackets,  ensuring  sizeable  benefits
for lower and middle-income taxpayers. Workers earning less than R23  000  a
year will now pay no personal income tax ... [Applause]  ...  and  a  worker
earning R70 000 will pay about 12% less tax, increasing  her  take-home  pay
by about R140 a month. [Applause.]

In his address at the opening of Parliament, the  President  indicated  that
Government would explore the feasibility of ``reducing the  cost  of  labour
without reducing workers' wages''. In the 2001 Budget, R600 million  is  set
aside for a wage incentive to encourage job creation by  reducing  the  cost
of hiring new workers and offering learnerships. Over  the  next  couple  of
months, Sars and the national Treasury will develop a tax  measure  that  is
both economically efficient and simple in administration and compliance.  It
is envisaged that this will be introduced from 1 October this year.

The tax exemption on interest and dividend income is raised by R1 000 to  R4
000 for people under 65 and R5 000 for taxpayers  aged  65  and  over.  This
provides further tax relief to those living  on  modest  fixed-interest  and
dividend incomes.

Investment in strategic industrial projects that promise significant  direct
and indirect benefits to the South African economy are critical  to  placing
South Africa on a higher sustainable growth path.  I  have  agreed  with  my
colleague, the Minister of Trade and Industry - under duress,  Alec  -  that
R3 billion be set aside over the next four years for incentives targeted  at
strategic industrial projects which meet agreed criteria, and one  of  which
is, of course, very importantly, job creation.

An allowance of either 50%  or  100%  of  an  approved  investment  will  be
granted to companies undertaking strategic projects. The allowance  will  be
calculated with reference to the cost  of  the  investment  undertaken.  The
national Treasury, Sars and  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  will
finalise the details of these incentives before the end of March,  including
the stringent criteria against which projects must be assessed.

Government continues to support small businesses, which are key  engines  of
job creation. In the Budget we tabled here last year, a reduced tax rate  of
15% of the first R100 000 of  taxable  income  was  introduced  for  certain
small businesses. The tax privileges for small businesses  are  extended  in
this Budget to allow for the immediate deduction of  investment  expenditure
in manufacturing assets in the year in which the investment  is  made.  This
will cost R40 million.
So the fruits are truly much sweeter. I think by this time  everybody  knows
what they have got the apples for. These  are  very  sweet  apples  -  sweet
fruits - that we have earned from the tough decisions we have taken  in  the
past.

Structural reforms to the tax system

In the 2000  Budget  several  proposals  were  introduced  with  prospective
effect, including residence-based income  taxation  and  the  capital  gains
tax. The residence-based income tax came into operation on  1  January  this
year. This structural change to the income tax is necessary to  ensure  that
the  South  African  tax  system  keeps  pace  with  globalisation  and  the
integration of South Africa with the world economy.

Capital gains tax, estate duty and donations tax

Capital gains tax was to be introduced with effect from 1 April  this  year.
Government has listened carefully to the proceedings of  Parliament's  Joint
Committee  on  Finance,  which  has  held  public  hearings  on  the   draft
legislation. While it is imperative that this fundamental  change  be  made,
it is proposed that the implementation be deferred to 1 October  2001.  This
will give the private sector - the financial services sector  in  particular
-  ample  time  to  amend  its  management  information  systems  to  ensure
effective implementation.

I would like to stress to the President that the  commitment  we  made  here
that Sars would be ready by 1 April has been kept. So we are ready to  roll.
But it is important that we allow the financial services sector time to  get
their systems in order so that the tax works effectively.

A key strength of the proposed capital gains tax is that it is  levied  when
the owner of an  asset  dies  or  the  asset  is  donated.  To  counter  any
perceived double taxation of these assets, it  is  proposed  to  reduce  the
estate duty and donations tax rates to 20%.

Closing tax loopholes

Our ongoing tax  reform  programme  aims  to  widen  tax  bases  and  reduce
statutory rates. As in the past, this will include identifying  and  closing
potential loopholes in the company income  tax.  Items  to  be  investigated
include:


  -   Section 24C of the Income Tax Act, which  allows  for  the  immediate
     deduction of future expenditure.


  -   Provisions allowing deductions for contingency reserves of short-term
     insurers.


  -   The taxation of intangibles.


  -   The possibility of bringing all company directors into the pay-as-you-
     earn (PAYE) income tax system.

Unbundling transactions

Unbundling provisions were  introduced  to  facilitate  the  dismantling  of
South African corporate structures. The internationalisation  of  the  South
African economy means that non-South African residents are  benefiting  from
these provisions. Sars and the national Treasury will therefore  review  the
unbundling provisions to ensure they are still appropriate  in  the  current
business environment.

Review of tax on banks

Government is concerned about the low effective tax  rate  on  banks.  Banks
are able to defer and avoid tax by using derivative financial  products  and
structured, asset-based finance techniques, amongst other devices.  In  2001
Government will engage with the industry to address this. The initial  focus
will be on increased  audit  and  possible  legislative  changes,  including
clarifying the distinction between capital and ordinary income for the  sale
of financial  instruments,  reviewing  the  tax  rules  regarding  financial
leases and ensuring the immediate accrual of certain  income  receipts  that
are postponed through artificial contingencies.

A number of countries have limited the scope  for  banks  to  avoid  tax  by
introducing  alternative  minimum  taxes  or  presumptive  taxes  on  easily
identifiable and audited tax bases, for example on  gross  assets.  We  will
engage with the banks on the  appropriateness  of  this  measure  for  South
Africa.

Indirect tax proposals

Vat zero-rate on illuminating paraffin

Illuminating  paraffin  is  an  important  energy  source   for   low-income
households in this country, especially in rural areas. As with other  fuels,
the price of illuminating paraffin has increased dramatically over the  past
year or two. To alleviate the plight of these  poor  households,  Government
is zero-rating paraffin for VAT purposes  from  1  April  2001.  [Applause.]
This will reduce the price by about 40 cents a  litre.  We  trust  that  the
R400 million we are giving up  will  be  passed  on  to  consumers,  thereby
providing tax relief to the intended beneficiaries. Let me appeal to all  of
us to be vigilant about ensuring that the benefits accrue to the  very  poor
who use paraffin in their everyday lives. [Applause.]

Specific excise duties

Revenues from specific excise duties have been a buoyant source of  revenue.
Changes to specific excises, informed by revenue and health  considerations,
include:


  -   Beer and cider taxes are raised by 6% or 2,3 cents  a  can,  in  line
     with inflation. [Applause.]


  -   I know I am going to get into trouble  for  this:  Sorghum  beer  and
     sorghum flour duties are raised by 5%,  which  is  below  the  rate  of
     inflation. [Interjections.] [Laughter.] Duties on these products have -
     under protest from the Minister of Home Affairs - not been  raised  for
     two years now.


  -    Duties  on  all  other  alcoholic  beverages  are  raised  by   10%.
     [Applause.]
  -   Taxes on tobacco products are raised by between 11,8%  and  20,2%  to
     maintain the 50% tax incidence. This increases the price of a packet of
     20 cigarettes by 33,8 cents. [Applause.]


  -   Duties on soft drinks and mineral water are  reduced  by  25%,  or  2
     cents a litre.

These measures will raise estimated revenue by R779 million. This is not  so
sweet!

In terms of section 58 of the Customs and Excise Act of 1964, I lay  on  the
Table for consideration by the House the proposals  in  respect  of  customs
and excise duties.

Fuel levy

Fuel prices have increased considerably over the past two years.  Government
is aware of the pressure  this  has  placed  on  the  disposable  income  of
household and business budgets.

Fuel taxes serve a variety  of  purposes.  First,  they  are  a  significant
source of general Government revenue. Second, they play  an  important  role
in limiting the demand for fuel products, which has important  environmental
and balance of payments benefits.

Given that the fuel levy is a specific excise tax, it is imperative for  the
sake of consistent tax policy that it be reviewed in the annual  Budget,  in
line with macroeconomic projections of the inflation rate. In  this  context
and recognising the impact of rising fuel prices  on  the  economy,  we  are
proposing to raise the fuel levy  by  less  than  inflation.  The  following
increases in the general fuel levy are proposed:


  -   2,4 cents a litre on leaded and unleaded petrol; and


  -   1,9 cents a litre on diesel.

These represent increases of only 2,5% on the tax rate, which is well  below
the anticipated inflation rate. These increases  will  be  implemented  with
the normal price adjustments on 4 April 2001 and will  raise  an  additional
R363 million.

Since the octane levels of leaded and unleaded petrol were equalised,  there
has been an equalisation levy of 3 cents a litre on unleaded petrol.  It  is
proposed that from 4 April 2001 this be included in the general  fuel  levy.
Thus, the general levy on unleaded petrol  is  raised  by  an  additional  3
cents a litre and the equalisation levy is reduced by 3 cents a litre,  with
no net impact on the overall levies and, hence, the pump price.

Road Accident Fund

To meet the ongoing liabilities of the  Road  Accident  Fund,  the  levy  on
petrol will be increased by 2 cents a litre from  4  April  2001.  When  the
diesel concessions which  I  referred  to  earlier  and  will  elaborate  on
shortly are introduced on 4 July  2001,  the  Road  Accident  Fund  levy  on
diesel will be brought in line with that on petrol at 16,5  cents  a  litre.
These measures will increase revenue to  the  Road  Accident  Fund  by  R437
million.

Diesel fuel concession for primary production

In the Budget last year, a  diesel  fuel  concession  was  reintroduced  for
fishing and coastal shipping. Government committed itself to  exploring  the
possibility of extending this to  other  primary  producers,  contingent  on
developing an administrative regime  to  minimise  the  risk  of  fraud  and
ensuring that  the  concession  is  affordable  within  the  broader  fiscal
framework.

The bulk of diesel fuel used in farming, forestry and  mining  is  used  off
road. Given this, and to  encourage  the  international  competitiveness  of
especially our farmers, foresters and  miners,  the  following  diesel  fuel
concessions are proposed:


  -    25,6  cents  a  litre  of  the  general  fuel  levy  on   qualifying
     consumption; and


  -   the full 16,5 cents a litre Road Accident  Fund  levy  on  qualifying
     consumption - that is 42 cents a litre.

Qualifying consumption will be 80% of total consumption. Diesel  concessions
will be implemented on 4 July 2001 and will cost us R417 million a year.

Furthermore, the following additional concessions are proposed:


  -   Offshore mining and the National Sea Rescue Institute will receive  a
     100% concession of the general fuel levy and  the  Road  Accident  Fund
     Levy.


  -   Spoornet will receive a 100% concession of  the  Road  Accident  Fund
     levy.

Ad valorem excises

The national Treasury and Sars have reviewed the administrative  system  for
ad valorem customs and  excise  duties.  It  is  evident  that  considerable
savings will result from reforming this system. From 1 July  this  year  the
value-determination  formula  for  domestically  produced  goods   will   be
eliminated and duties will be  levied  on  the  invoice  price  of  dutiable
items. In addition, the maximum statutory rate will be  decreased  from  10%
to 7% and the duty rate on cosmetics will be reduced from 10%  to  5%.  This
will result in a revenue loss of R210 million.

Tax administration

It is also important to deal with  issues  of  tax  administration.  The  SA
Revenue Service is committed to improving tax administration  and  nurturing
a climate of voluntary compliance with the objective of broadening  the  tax
base so as to reduce the tax  burden  on  all  our  citizens.  As  citizens,
meeting our tax obligations and acting within the letter and spirit  of  the
law are not optional. They are part of understanding that, in  a  democracy,
rights and obligations are two sides of the same coin. [Applause.]
Corporate and private citizens who evade the law are committing a crime  and
depriving the Government of the resources needed to address  poverty,  fight
crime and achieve other social  and  economic  objectives.  [Applause.]  Tax
evasion also undermines investor confidence  and  increases  the  burden  of
ordinary taxpaying citizens. I want to commend the actions taken by Sars  to
curb tax evasion and fraud in the past year, including efforts to  root  out
corruption within the organisation itself. We must signal that we  will  not
tolerate this type of criminal activity anywhere. [Applause.]

Sars is also committed to making it easier for our people to meet their  tax
obligations, by providing  a  better  service.  The  groundwork  for  a  new
taxpayer  charter  has  been  laid,  giving  us  important  feedback   about
taxpayers' needs and concerns. The survey  results  have  informed  a  major
restructuring project, which  has  now  entered  its  implementation  phase.
KwaZulu-Natal taxpayers will benefit first from  Sars's  new  way  of  doing
business with the opening in October this year of  a  processing  centre  to
improve turnaround times. This centre will  be  supported  by  a  compliance
centre and service centres.

Other initiatives include electronic  submission  of  certain  tax  returns,
such as provisional tax and pay-as-you-earn, and a call  centre  focused  on
recovering outstanding debts. More than 17 000 taxpayers were  contacted  in
the call centre's first week of operation and more than a million  taxpayers
can expect a call from us this year.  Sars's  budget  will  be  supplemented
over the next three years  to  enable  us  to  provide  better  services  to
taxpayers and to reduce tax evasion and avoidance. Also, in the  context  of
the reorganisation of Sars, we will be  concentrating  on  better  port  and
border post administration to ensure that illegal goods  do  not  enter  our
country, that back-door routes are shut down, and that jobs in South  Africa
are protected from the illegal activities of smugglers. [Applause.]

Financing proposals

After taking account of our spending proposals and revenue estimates,  there
is a budget deficit of R24,9 billion to finance next year, or 2,5%  of  GDP.
We expect to finance the deficit largely through restructuring proceeds.

To date, total investment  of  R19  billion  has  been  raised  through  the
restructuring of state assets, mainly from  international  equity  partners,
of which R12,4 billion has been used to reduce debt. Given  the  accelerated
pace of implementation, some R18 billion from the  restructuring  of  public
enterprises is expected in the new fiscal year -  is  that  right,  Minister
Radebe? - decreasing the net borrowing requirement to R7,5 billion.

We  propose  to  raise  R3,5  billion  in  short-term   loans   next   year,
contributing further to the liquidity of this market. Net foreign  borrowing
to the value of R11,3 billion is proposed. This will  allow  domestic  long-
term debt to be reduced by about R7,4 billion.  In  effect,  we  propose  to
repay about R7,5 billion in long-term rand-denominated debt next year.
At the end of 2000-01, total net loan debt will amount  to  R397,5  billion,
or 44,3% of GDP, down from over 48%  four  years  ago.  Debt  will  steadily
decline as a share of GDP to a projected 39,1% by the  end  of  2003-04.  We
say  again:  Eli  lixesha  lokuba   sonke   sixhamle   ubumnandi   beziqhamo
zenkululeko. [Kwaqhwatywa.] [This is the time for  us  to  enjoy  the  sweet
fruit of liberty. [Applause.]] It is clear that the fruits of our  decisions
gradually acquire the sweet taste of liberty.

Conclusion

Before concluding I have two tasks to perform.  The  first  is  to  lay  the
following documents on the Table:

(1)   Budget Speech - 21 February 2001 [RP 28-2001].

(2)   Estimate of National Revenue 2001 [RP 34-2001].

(3)   Taxation proposals: Income Tax.

(4)   Taxation proposals in respect of specific excise duties  (customs  and
     excise) [tabled at 15:12].

(5)   Division of Revenue Bill    [B 11-2001].

(6)   Budget Review 2001, including ``Annexure E: Explanatory Memorandum  on
     the Division of Revenue Bill'' tabled in terms of section 10(5) of  the
     Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Act, 1997 (Act No 97 of 1997) [RP 27-
     2001].

(7)   Estimates of National Expenditure, 2001 [RP 30-2001].

(8)   Appropriation Bill     [B10-2001].

I would also like to take a  moment  to  pay  tribute  to  about  500  South
Africans who probably are not in this House today, people  who  participated
in a wide programme called ``Tips  for  Trevor''  through  the  departmental
website, radio stations, newspapers, and who offered their bits  of  advice.
South Africans from the widest possible cross section -  from  somebody  who
describes himself as a humble traffic officer,  to  people  who  have  jobs,
such as radio station talk show hosts; from individuals  who  are  employees
somewhere and stole a moment of Internet time to  communicate  with  us,  to
people  who  are  pensioners  and  borrowed  e-mail  facilities  from  their
children; from tax professors and workers - spoke  to  us  about  what  they
wanted. Many of them spoke about tax proposals.

I am sure that they  will  find  that  their  views  are  expressed  in  the
decisions that we are placing before this  House  today.  Others  will  find
that we are in disagreement with the fundamentals of what they proposed.  On
the expenditure side, many would be happy with the kinds of  decisions  that
we are placing before this House today. Yet others raised matters  that  are
outside of the Budget but important for us to  be  alive  to,  such  as  the
amount that South Africans spend on gambling in casinos,  on  Lotto  and  so
on, asking that we examine and re-examine these kinds of  issues  to  ensure
that we all have a better quality of life. To all of those  South  Africans,
too many to name, I want  to  say  thank  you.  I  want  to  give  them  the
assurance that I have personally read every message they have  sent  to  me,
and I am very grateful for the time and effort that they took to talk to  us
in this way. [Applause.]

Madam Speaker, allow me to express my profound appreciation to:


  -   President Mbeki for his leadership and the challenges he puts  before
     us - he does not let us get off easy - and for the challenges he placed
     before all of us in this House in his opening  of  Parliament  address,
     and for the work he is doing on the continent that continues to draw us
     into a continually expanding view of what our responsibilities  are  as
     Africans involved in Government. [Applause.]


  -   Deputy President Zuma and my  Cabinet  colleagues,  particularly  the
     members of the Ministers' Committee on the Budget - however  much  some
     of them whinge, Essop [Laughter.] - for their  initiative  in  bringing
     forward budget suggestions and their good humour when these  could  not
     be accommodated.


  -   Of course, to Deputy Minister Mandisi ``Sipho'' Mpahlwa  for  sharing
     the duties we carry and for friendship.


  -   My Team Finance - the MECs for finance - who have  led  with  courage
     and professionalism, and, I think, the fruits of their efforts will  be
     very sweet in the provinces as well.

Our task has been greatly facilitated by several others:


  -   Governor Tito Mboweni and his team at the SA Reserve Bank;


  -   Murphy Morobe and members of the Financial and Fiscal Commission;


  -   Philip Dexter and Nedlac;


  -   Prof Michael Katz and the tax commission;
  -   Ms  Barbara  Hogan  and  Ms  Qedani  Mahlangu,  chairpersons  of  the
     Portfolio and Select Committee on Finance in Parliament,  respectively.
     [Applause.]

This Budget is largely the fruit of the efforts  of  the  national  Treasury
and the SA Revenue Service. [Laughter.] Special  thanks  are  due  to  Maria
Ramos and Pravin Gordhan for the leadership they have given. [Applause.]

I would also like to thank my family for their support, the  Mpahlwa  family
for continuing to keep Sipho in good  spirits,  and  perhaps  last  but  not
least, the staff of the Ministry who  tolerate  us  with  such  good  cheer.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order, hon members.  The  Appropriation  Bill  and  the  papers
tabled ...

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, I am the only one who  did  not
get an apple. I did not get an apple. [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Minister, I will intercede on your behalf.

The Appropriation Bill and  the  papers  tabled  will  be  referred  to  the
Portfolio Committee on Finance for consideration  and  report  in  terms  of
Rule 291.

Hon members,  the  Minister  has  been  very  generous,  but  obviously  not
generous enough with his gifts today. As hon members are all aware, we  have
a code of conduct. Now I am investigating whether I can make  a  declaration
on Parliament's behalf for the apples, or whether you each have  to  declare
your apple. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The House adjourned at 15:28.

National Assembly:

1.    The Speaker:


     The President of the Republic submitted the following letter, dated  19
     February 2001, to the Speaker informing Parliament of the employment of
     the South African National Defence Force:




     EMPLOYMENT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL DEFENCE  FORCE  IN  COMPLIANCE
     WITH THE INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF  THE  REPUBLIC  OF  SOUTH  AFRICA
     TOWARDS THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE  FOR  HUMANITARIAN
     ASSISTANCE DURING WIDESPREAD FLOODING


     This  serves  to  inform  the  National  Assembly  that  the  President
     authorised the employment  of  South  African  National  Defence  Force
     (SANDF) personnel  to  fulfil  the  international  obligations  of  the
     Republic of South Africa towards the  Government  of  the  Republic  of
     Mozambique for humanitarian assistance during  widespread  flooding  in
     the Zambezia Province.


     This employment was authorised in accordance  with  the  provisions  of
     Section 82(4)(b)(ii) read with Section 227(1)(d) of the Constitution of
     the Republic of South  Africa,  1993  (Act  No  200  of  1993),  [which
     Sections continue to be in force in terms of Item 24(1) of  Schedule  6
     to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act  No  108
     of 1996)], read further with Section 3(2)(a)(iv) of  the  Defence  Act,
     1957 (Act No 44 of 1957).


     (a)    Personnel. A  total  of  13  personnel  have  been  deployed  to
         Mozambique: 3 x pilots, 2 x navigators, 2 x flight engineers,  3  x
         air loadmasters, 1 x interpreter and 2 x medical personnel.


     (b)    Aircraft. 1 x C-130 cargo aircraft and  2  x  medical  personnel
         aircraft.


     The SANDF members were deployed for a total  of  three  days  over  the
     period 10 February 2001 to 12 February 2001.
