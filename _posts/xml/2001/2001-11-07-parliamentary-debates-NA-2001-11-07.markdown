  REPORT BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ON WORLD CONFERENCE AGAINST RACISM

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker and hon members, we  wish  to
take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks to  all  South  Africans
who  made  the  World  Conference  against  Racism,  Racial  Discrimination,
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance the success that it truly was;  from  the
ordinary South Africans to parliamentarians, academics,  artists,  sportsmen
and   sportswomen,   youth   and,   especially,   to   the   South   African
nongovernmental organisations for steering  the  NGO  forum  the  successful
outcome.

My deep appreciation and gratitude go  to  my  colleagues,  who  spent  long
hours hammering consensus in the different committees and  of,  course,  all
the staff from Foreign Affairs and  the  different  departments  who  worked
very hard behind the scenes to produce a successful conference.  We  met  in
Durban to  discuss  what  we  would  collectively  do  to  change  the  life
conditions of those who  are  affected  by  racism,  racial  discrimination,
xenophobia and  related  intolerance.  It  was  a  fitting  tribute  to  the
sacrifice of  millions  inside  and  outside  the  country  that  the  World
Conference against Racism was held in South Africa. It was correct that  the
conference was held in our country, which had witnessed the  most  repugnant
form of institutionalised racism.
South Africa, which was not so long ago the fountain  head  of  racism,  was
the right venue to demonstrate to the world that  the  demon  and  ghost  of
racism can be exorcised. To  us  as  South  Africans  the  hosting  of  this
conference presented the opportunity to express our  deeply  felt  gratitude
to the international community for waging together with us,  the  relentless
struggle against apartheid  and  racism,  for  the  international  community
could not have been indifferent to the suffering of fellow human  beings  in
South Africa. They could see that as long as  the  apartheid  crime  against
humanity was allowed to exist as a  result  of  their  inactivity,  so  long
would their own humanity be denied and their dignity violated.

The peoples of the world entertained the  hope  that  out  of  the  terrible
human disaster that apartheid was, would be born a democratic South  Africa,
anchored in nonracialism, with equality of all national  groups  guaranteed,
and a South Africa that respects human rights, at peace with the  world  and
working tirelessly for the upliftment of all its human beings and  citizens.
To the international community, there could be no better  venue  than  South
Africa which occupied a pre-eminent place in the latter  half  of  the  20th
century.

To the indigenous people who are daily subjected to humiliation through  the
staggering arrogance of those who have deigned themselves  their  superiors,
the Conference against Racism offered hope that their lot would  change  for
the better. To the Romas,  the  Gypsies,  the  Travellers,  the  Sinti,  the
indigenous  people  whose  very  life  is  characterised  by  conditions  of
wretchedness,  degrading  hunger  and  denigrating  racism,  the  conference
renewed their confidence in themselves and their dignity, and accorded  them
the necessary respect. We had the opportunity to listen  to  the  indigenous
people tell their stories of how in their everyday life they are treated  as
subhumans. We knew then that the conference was a success.

To the immigrants,  to  women  and  children  who  are  trafficked  as  mere
chattels, the conference stood before  the  cruel  and  shameful  life  they
endure and emphasized the enjoyment of  human  rights  that  is  inherently,
inalienably and rightfully theirs too. It could  be  that  many  across  our
common universe expected us - with good  reason,  because  of  our  specific
history - to have the possibility and responsibility to  make  an  important
contribution to the universal struggle to defeat the scourge of racism.

It cannot be gainsaid that racism,  racial  discrimination,  xenophobia  and
related intolerance is on the rise,  especially  in  the  countries  of  the
developed north. No country is immune from racism.  The  scourge  of  racism
afflicts us all, in one way or another. The barbaric acts  of  terrorism  in
the United States have shown that the conference is even more important  now
than it was before 11 September.  Equally  appalling,  there  has  been  the
tendency in some developing countries - and even here in South Africa  -  to
vent out anger at a particular group of people because of their religion.

The last few weeks have witnessed hitherto, the  rise  of  Islamophobia  and
anti-Arab feelings and related intolerance in the developed world.  This  in
itself is the work of specialists on the Middle East and on Islam. The  view
expressed by those pseudo-specialists reinforces  the  stereotyping  of  the
people of Middle Eastern origin as inherently violent. This we must  reject,
just as the Durban conference instructed us to do.

For this and many other reasons it was  timely  that  the  World  Conference
against Racism was held and set out an agenda to roll back the frontiers  of
racism. Those of us who stayed because we  cared  deeply  about  the  social
ills that afflict human beings all over the world, also  stayed  because  we
understood the urgency of launching a global  movement  against  racism  and
against those disempowered and  socially  excluded,  which  has  become  the
daily companion of the majority of the peoples of the world.

Despite the absence of others, the World Conference against Racism  met  and
successfully concluded its work. The conference spoke eloquently of the  New
World Order, which is people-centred. This new order will work hard to  deal
comprehensively with poverty eradication and further harness the process  of
globalisation to address the growing  gap  of  wealth  between  and  amongst
countries. Necessarily, this would entail the formation  of  a  mass  global
movement against racism and xenophobia to take this  struggle  forward.  The
conference continued and succeeded in spite and despite attempts  of  others
to embark on misguided actions, if only to inflict maximum embarrassment  on
us before the world delegates.

The defeat of apartheid and the peaceful transfer of power  from  the  white
racist minority government to the majority, predominantly black,  government
offered hope to many millions around the world that, at last,  a  real  base
to launch a global offensive against racism was  secured.  The  despised  of
the world acknowledged with admiration that,  for  the  first  time  in  the
history of the world, the victims of the worst form of racism were in  power
and that these victims of racism, having  understood  the  humiliation  they
had suffered, have taken the position that they will  not  visit  racism  on
the minority. They have taken a decision  that  they  will  restore  dignity
both to the indigenous majority and to the white minority  in  our  country.
This epoch-making victory gave renewed hope to  millions  around  the  world
who are despised  because  of  their  colour,  culture  and  traditions,  to
millions who face the degrading and denigrating conditions  of  poverty  and
millions who die of curable diseases.

South Africa is home to the former oppressor and the oppressed  equally.  We
are the embodiment, in a way, of the United Nations, a country endowed  with
a different tapestry of cultures  and  a  mosaic  of  religions.  We  are  a
country that is varied in many respects, like the colours  of  the  rainbow.
We are the microcosm of the world. Some people refer  to  us  as  a  miracle
precisely because  we  demonstrated  that  no  matter  how  intractable  our
situation at times had seemed to be, we had the  ability  and  ingenuity  to
reach  a  compromise.  What  had  been  expected  to  be   an   unimaginable
conflagration made way for co-operation among various groups.  It  seems  to
us that we must have said  to  ourselves  that  the  oppression  of  one  by
another diminishes the victim and the perpetrator as well. As  it  was  once
said by a religious writer, and I quote:


  Consider the flowers of a garden, it will be said that  though  differing
  in kind, colour, form and shape, yet in as much as they are refreshed  by
  waters of one spring, revived by the breath of one wind,  invigorated  by
  the rays of one sun, this diversity increaseth  their  charm  and  addeth
  onto their beauty. How unpleasing to the eye if all flowers  and  plants,
  the leaves and blossoms and the fruit and branches of the  trees  of  the
  garden were all the same shape and colour. Diversity of  hues,  form  and
  shape enricheth  and  adorneth  the  garden  and  heightenth  the  effect
  thereof.

This could not be a  more  correct  reflection  of  our  situation  and  the
situation of the world. What was said in this House last week, and I  quote:
`` ... unfinished business between the  Afrikaner  and  the  blacks  ...  ''
beautifully captures our commitment to work together for  the  good  of  our
people. Our armed forces who are doing sterling work inside and outside  the
country, black and white,  amply  demonstrate  the  spirit  of  togetherness
which we speak of. What was not so long  ago  an  army  of  destruction  and
mayhem, has become an army of healing and peacekeeping. This is  what  makes
South Africa unique and this is what we can share with the  world.  This  is
what we shared with the world during the World Conference against Racism.

The World Conference against Racism  was  a  landmark,  an  historic  United
Nations conference arranged in close co-operation with  the  Office  of  the
High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva. The process had been  a  truly
inclusive and broadly consultative one.  Many  member  states  attended  and
with serious commitment ensured the successful outcome thereof.

Despite the contentious issue before  it,  the  conference  dug  deep  in  a
supreme effort to make it a success in order to lay a  firm  foundation  for
the  future  of  tolerance  and  harmonious  coexistence.  Those  who  cared
sincerely about the critically important matters of  human  rights  for  all
and human dignity for all stayed and  grappled  with  sensitive  issues  and
responded creatively to all the challenges posed as a result.

The conference, inter alia, agreed that the process should  be  directed  at
the most pressing  challenge  of  our  time.  Through  the  Declaration  and
Programme of Action, it was agreed to launch the global army against  racism
in all countries in  order  to  uproot  the  scourge  of  racism.  From  the
intergovernmental to nongovernmental and civil society, everybody agreed  in
various  forums  to  work  jointly  in  partnership  to   take   the   world
conference's work forward.

In South Africa, various government departments  and  national  institutions
will now take the process  forward  in  an  action-oriented,  but  well  co-
ordinated way. It should be important for us  as  parliamentarians  also  to
chart our own  programme,  co-ordinated  with  the  rest  of  the  country's
programme for taking the results of this conference forward.

Maybe I should just touch on what became the four  contentious  issues  that
the conference grappled with: Past  injustices,  Palestine  and  the  Middle
Eastern  grounds  for  discrimination  and  the  list   of   victims   which
continuously bogged the process down.

With respect to slavery, it has always been the contention of  South  Africa
that unless and until the question of slavery is dealt with adequately,  the
centuries-old problem of racism could never  be  addressed.  Slavery,  which
has seen African men, women and children shipped across the oceans  in  dark
and pungent dungeons, has given  rise  to  the  centuries-old  racism  which
describes us as anything but human.

There was never any doubt in my mind that  those  who  visited  this  untold
harm and humiliation on Africans would not accept responsibility  for  their
actions. What was even more important was an attempt to reduce this pain  to
which the Africans were subjected into a money game.  This  was  founded  on
the erroneous thinking that Africans wanted an apology in order  to  open  a
legal way for compensation and for making money.

To us  as  Africans  our  dignity  has  always  been  and  will  forever  be
priceless. No amount of money could bring back our dignity. All  we  wanted,
and I am happy to tell the House that we did receive at  the  end,  was  for
those who committed an affront to  our  dignity  to  squarely  look  at  the
damage they caused and own up to it. We wanted  the  perpetrators  of  these
crimes of slavery, colonialism and racism to sit together with  the  victims
of these antihuman and antisocial ideologies  and  apologise  for  them  and
their consequences.

After protracted deliberations, all the stakeholders in  this  issue  agreed
on common positions by consensus.  The  final  outcome  addresses  the  main
issue of concern for Africa and  the  African  people  in  the  diaspora  in
particular,  including  the  developing  world  in  general.  Apartheid  and
genocide, in the context of the conference,  were  declared  crimes  against
humanity and colonialism was seen for what it was, nothing  but  unspeakable
and rabid racism.

The apology for  these  inhuman  acts  was  made,  albeit  with  some  legal
caveats. For the first time in  the  history  of  the  world,  these  crimes
against humanity were publicly acknowledged and  it  was  agreed  that  they
accounted  for  Africa's  underdevelopment  and  reinforced  racism  against
Africans.

The  broader  remedial  measures,  which  are  encapsulated   in   the   New
Partnership  for  African  Development,  were  agreed  upon.  These  include
socioeconomic and developmental initiatives and other  innovative  ideas  to
ensure that  the  affected  countries  and  their  citizens  should  benefit
therefrom in as  broad  a  sense  as  possible.  Such  initiatives,  finally
adopted by the World Conference against Racism, are comprehensive,  holistic
and sustainable and will benefit more victims.

The World Conference  against  Racism  also  reaffirmed  the  right  of  the
Palestinian people to self-determination  and  the  establishment  of  their
independent state, and  the  right  of  Israel  to  live  in  conditions  of
security.  The  return  of  the  refugees  was  also  acknowledged  in   the
international document. The conference also recalled the ghastly  holocaust.
Additionally,  it  recognised  the  need  to   counter   anti-Semitism   and
Islamophobia worldwide. We also agreed on the grounds of discrimination  and
the listing of victims.

All member states of the  UN  are  now  expected  to  translate  the  Durban
Declaration into action. In this respect,  governments,  civil  society  and
also business sectors would have specific roles in realising the  objectives
of the conference.

Consequently, the Department of Foreign  Affairs  will  be  making  specific
recommendations to Cabinet in  the  near  future  to  ensure  effective  and
appropriate action at  the  national  level.  The  proposals  will  seek  to
involve all key players of South Africa's society. Additionally, the  Durban
document also  recommends  further  action  at  regional  and  international
levels.
Finally, the World Conference against Racism succeeded  because  all  of  us
made a superhuman effort. There were times when the  conference  hovered  on
the brink of collapse. But, it must have occurred to all  participants  that
the conference had to succeed for the sake of posterity. We all had  to  dig
deep in ourselves to reach the acceptable outcomes that we achieved.

At the end of this conference, we could all agree that what we had  set  out
to do has been done. While we agree that there  is  still  a  long  road  to
travel, we have begun. The movement  I  represent,  the  ANC,  had  for  the
entirety of its existence sought  to  give  succour  to  the  despised,  the
wretched of the earth. In  continuing  this  rich  tradition,  through  this
conference, we hope we have made a contribution  to  fight  till  racism  is
eliminated.

Amidst all the rough-and-tumble of the conference,  we  were  emboldened  by
the beautiful words of Antjie Krog  in  her  book  entitled  Country  of  My
Skull, where she says:


  because of you
  this country no longer lies
  between us, but within
  it breathes becalmed
  after being wounded
  in its wondrous throat
  in the cradle of my skull
  it sings, it ignites
  my tongue, my inner ear, the cavity of heart
  shudders towards the outline ...
  of my soul, the retina learns to expand
  daily because by a thousand stories
  I was scorched
  A new skin
  I am changed forever, I want to say:
  forgive me
  forgive me
  Forgive me
  You whom I have wronged, please
  take me
  with you.

This genuine expression of atonement, appealed to us to work even harder  to
share with the world the gift of South Africa's uniqueness. [Applause.]

Dr Z P JORDAN: Madam  Speaker,  colleagues,  the  World  Conference  against
Racism was not about retribution, nor was  it  an  attempt  to  put  certain
governments and countries in the dock. It was a conference that  represented
a genuine attempt by the international community to tackle one of  the  most
degrading and demeaning practices from our collective past with  a  view  to
its eradication. It was about restoring  the  humanity  of  the  victims  of
racism, racial discrimination and related forms of intolerance. It was  also
about rescuing the humanity of those who  were  its  perpetrators.  All  the
participants in that conference agreed that it should  begin  a  process  of
healing,  but  that  that  healing  process   itself   required   that   the
perpetrators and the victims act together to repair the damage done  to  the
human family.

The unequal relationship  between  the  Europeans  and  the  rest  that  had
evolved after the European Rennaissance was captured by  the  poet  laureate
of British imperialism, Rudyard  Kipling,  who  contemptuously  referred  to
those whom the European powers had conquered and colonised as  ``half  devil
and half child''. This assumption  of  European  racial  superiority  was  a
function of the slave trade, of colonial conquest and  imperialism,  and  it
was  an  assumption  that  had  had  and  would  have  the  most  pernicious
consequences. In the British colony of Virginia, anticipating  the  ruthless
policies of genocide pursued by successive governments of the United  States
well into the 19th century,  smallpox-infested  blankets  were  deliberately
sold to a native American nation in the full knowledge that this would  mean
their decimation.

In the foreign concessions that the British, French, Americans  and  Germans
carved out in the port cities of China, signs  reading  ``Dogs  and  Chinese
not allowed'' were placed at the park entrances. Indeed,  here  in  our  own
country a separate lift for ``goods and natives''  was  a  feature  of  many
buildings in the central business district of  Johannesburg  well  into  the
1970s.
It is an unfortunate fact  that,  except  for  the  most  enlightened,  most
whites thought these demeaning exclusions  unexceptional.  Such  undisguided
in-your-face racism was not merely a case of human  beings  behaving  badly,
but was also expressive of a power relationship in  which  the  whites  were
dominant. In every  colonial  society,  and  especially  in  pre-1994  South
Africa, race was  an  index  of  power  and  access  to  power.  It  defined
advantage and disadvantage.

But, in the last instance, systems of racism invariably fall back  on  brute
force to compel the targeted group to  submit  to  its  subordinate  status.
Such force may be wielded by the state, as in many colonial  situations  and
under  apartheid.  But  even  state  violence  is  sometimes  buttressed  by
informal force, as is the case of the racist  nightriders  of  the  Ku  Klux
Klan and the storm troopers of Hitler's Brown Shirts. It sometimes comes  in
the  shape  of  mobs,  as  happened  recently  in   Ulster   when   Catholic
schoolchildren had to run the gauntlet of an intimidating mob  of  screaming
loyalists to reach their school. This is possible because racism sets  up  a
moral universe from which  certain  human  beings  are  excluded.  Those  so
excluded can then legitimately be denied even the most elementary rights.

They can be treated as something equivalent to livestock that can be  bought
and sold. In the worst cases, they can be murdered en masse, as it  happened
with the Jews of Europe under the Nazi regime. But,  for  those  within  the
moral universe erected by racism, immense rewards can accrue. These are  not
rewards derived from merit. They are unearned and accrued to the members  of
the privileged group purely by virtue of their  membership  of  that  group.
The opponents of affirmative action,  who  like  to  dismiss  it  as  racial
quotas, seek to deny precisely this.

Merit, it must be understood, never was nor  is  a  criterion  in  a  racist
system. The rewards accruing to those who receive them have  nothing  to  do
with capacity or performance. Every strand of liberation politics  in  South
Africa long ago accepted that the white community had become  a  naturalised
component of this country over three centuries of residence. Recognition  of
that imposed certain policy imperatives, which is why  the  Freedom  Charter
unequivocally states that ``South Africa belongs to all those  who  live  in
it'', because it was anticipating a permanent white presence as one  of  the
elements of a diverse postapartheid South Africa.

Nonracism, as one of the defining  principles  of  the  ANC,  expresses  our
commitment to act together with other South Africans to create a society  in
which we acknowledge and affirm the diversity of our people as something  of
value and something enriching. It is a vision in diametrical  opposition  to
the pervasive racism and brutalisation which was characteristic of  colonial
domination and apartheid.  But,  it  is  still  an  unrealised  vision.  Its
realisation requires of us all a commitment  to  employ  the  power  of  the
state, public institutions and civil society to put an end  to  the  use  of
race as a determinant of access to power, status and wealth.

Racial oppression found expression in a number of palpable  forms.  We  know
from  the  reports  of  the  South  African  Statistical  Service  what  its
consequences have  been.  Uprooting  those  consequences  requires,  amongst
other things, precisely the correction of those  conditions.  In  our  view,
the content of freedom and  democracy  requires  radical  transformation  of
South Africa so as to create an  expanding  floor  of  economic  and  social
rights for the majority.

During the apartheid days, every bigot, racist and fascist in every part  of
the world saw apartheid South Africa as a vindication  of  their  mad  hopes
and misanthropic dreams. We must now turn democratic  South  Africa  into  a
beacon of hope for a nonracial world. [Applause.]

Mr E K MOORCROFT: Madam Speaker, the Minister of Foreign Affairs  has  given
a glowing account of the success of the United Nations'  conference  against
racism and I appreciate that the desire to be gracious hosts or  to  justify
the R100 million  price  tag  on  the  conference  probably  motivates  this
assessment. But, if we want more than what  one  journalist  called  ``pious
cant'' to come out of this conference, then we  need  to  take  a  hard  and
realistic look at what it did or did not achieve.

The media reports were damning. Time Magazine wrote, and I quote:


  The conference was a disgrace. The only good thing that might conceivably
  come out of the conference is a  determination  that  something  so  ill-
  advised, so poorly prepared, so intellectually  bankrupt  and  so  easily
  hijacked by special pleading must never be allowed to happen again.

The Economist said:


  The farce in Durban has done no one any good.

The New York Times wrote:


  While many presidents and foreign Ministers delivered  eloquent  speeches
  condemning racism and intolerance, few were willing to  publicly  address
  discrimination within their own borders.

This was the fatal flaw of the conference. It exposed the  weakness  of  the
United Nations as a mechanism to tackle issues affecting people  as  opposed
to states. A prime example is how the Indian government managed to keep  the
untouchables off the agenda. It was as if  a  silent  pact  existed  between
governments that they would rather not speak about real  racism  perpetrated
against real people all over the world today.

Governments preferred to play the blame, shame and  claim  game.  The  rules
are simple. Some states are victims and others are  guilty  and  should  pay
up. These claims are logged safely in the distant past, for example  demands
for reparations against slavery set up certain African countries  as  global
victims entitled  to  redress  from  the  United  States  and  Europe.  Only
President Wade of Senegal had the honesty to admit that his  ancestors  sold
their own people into slavery and  that  demanding  government-to-government
reparation for slavery is absurd.
When I visited Gorée Island in Senegal some years ago, the  curator  of  the
infamous slave lodge on the island  from  which  the  bulk  of  slaves  were
exported from  Africa  into  slavery,  declared  that  what  he  found  most
difficult to accept in the whole sordid history of slavery was the part  his
own people had played in the capture and trafficking of slaves.

What about the Arab states? Let us not forget that Arab slave  traders  were
an integral and  indispensable  part  of  the  slave  trade  and  that  Arab
involvement in slavery continued longer  and  equalled,  if  not  surpassed,
Western involvement. But of this there was not a word at the conference.

Then too, the conference chose to overlook  the  current  scourge  of  child
slavery in Africa. Child slaves, surely the most vulnerable of victims,  are
being trafficked to this day from one African state  to  another.  And  yet,
public officials and even  Unicef  workers  in  these  countries  refuse  to
acknowledge this practice as slavery.

Africa suffers from some of  the  world's  worst  problems  of  racism.  The
continent is riven by desperate conflicts  which  have  cost  the  lives  of
millions. Consider the racial divide  which  is  devastating  the  whole  of
central Africa, the conflict between the Hutus and the  Tutsis.  In  Burundi
and Rwanda the Tutsis are a minority of about 14%, yet have ruled  over  the
Hutu majority in undemocratic governments.

This despotic arrangement, and the fierce mutual loathing between them,  led
to the genocide on 100 000 Hutus in Burundi in 1972 and  800 000  Tutsis  in
Rwanda in 1994. The conflict has impacted on  the  war  now  raging  in  the
Democratic Republic  of  the  Congo.  Why  then  was  the  Palestine-Israeli
conflict afforded more attention at the world conference? The  issue  should
never have been allowed to hijack the agenda  in  the  way  it  did.  Racism
should not be used as a stick with which  to  beat  some  nations,  but  not
others.

Coming closer to home, an opinion poll released recently confirmed the  DA's
own research that unemployment and crime are the most  pressing  issues  for
South Africans. Racism takes  a  lowly  ninth  place  in  their  ranking  of
problems. Amongst black South Africans,  49%  believe  that  race  relations
have actually improved in recent years. This shows how out of touch the  ANC
are with the reality of ordinary people.

The ANC's submission to the conference argues that ``racism is as  acute  as
ever''. If the truth be told, what South Africans need are  not  talk  shops
on racism, but workshops on jobs, housing, health care, Aids  education  and
crime prevention. [Applause.]  If  we  are  serious  about  building  racial
tolerance in South Africa, we should start in Parliament.

Less than a month ago, during question time, Parliament reached a  new  low.
Black and coloured members of the DA came under  disgraceful  racial  attack
from the ANC. An ANC Minister called one of our coloured members a  coconut,
which is a pejorative term for  someone  who  is  supposedly  brown  on  the
outside, but white on the inside.  Yet  another  ANC  Minister  referred  to
members of the opposition who, in his view, were, ``a bit brown and try  too
hard to be white''.

But racial jibes feed  into  a  deeper  discourse  which  runs  through  ANC
propaganda, that the ANC is the  only  legitimate  representative  of  black
interests.  The  corollary  is  that  any  black  person  who  supports  the
opposition is a race traitor. The ugly truth of the matter is that  the  ANC
needs racism and race consciousness to keep its increasingly  disparate  and
dissatisfied constituency  together.  It  seeks  to  herd  all  black  South
Africans into a race-based majority and fence them off from the  opposition.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr O BALOYI: Madam Speaker and  hon  members,  the  holding  of  the  United
Nations World Conference  against  Racism,  Discrimination,  Xenophobia  and
Related Intolerance presented an  opportunity  to  reflect  on  race-related
issues both for South Africa and the entire world.

For the first time in the  history  of  mankind,  an  opportunity  was  made
available  to  postulate  and  review  the  principles  that  underpin   new
international  relations,  which  are  more  inspired   by   principles   of
substantive justice and international  economic  equalities  among  peoples,
nations and countries. The resultant effect would be to build a  better  and
more just world, free of intolerable levels  of  social  injustice,  poverty
and human  rights  abuses.  At  this  conference,  mankind  was  offered  an
opportunity to grow into its  new  stage  of  moral  awareness  and  finally
reject and condemn its  past  history,  turning  over  a  new  leaf  in  its
tormented journey  from  war  towards  peace,  from  poverty  and  injustice
towards prosperity and justice, and from oppression towards freedom.

Allow me to give context to the  freedom  I  am  talking  about.  I  am  not
talking  about  a  situation  where  we  paint  ourselves  into  boxes  that
determine what we will allow ourselves to do based on our race, gender,  age
and the external expectations that we believe those boxes impart. I  am  not
talking about a situation where we allow labels and expectations to keep  us
in boxes and then cry out for freedom. The entire purpose of life  on  earth
is for us  to  be  free.  We  should  exercise  free  will  and  choose  the
parameters of our freedom. What we do, instead, is  to  spend  most  of  our
lives doing and acquiring things that in  many  cases  keep  us  in  mental,
physical and emotional bondage. Freedom is  a  state  of  mind.  It  is  the
outgrowth of our willingness to make conscious choices of our own free  will
and to live through the consequences of our choices without blame, shame  or
guilt.

Sitting at the seemingly repetitive negotiations in the drafting  committees
and working groups of the UN World Conference against Racism,  one  gathered
an image of Western and African countries talking past one another. The  two
main aspects of  such  misunderstandings  were  the  issues  of  reparation,
including the  controversy  about  apologies  and  race.  African  countries
sought to affirm an unprecedented principle which  to  European  negotiators
seemed subversive of international law.

Past  slavery  and  colonialism  were  manifestations  of  racism  and   its
consequences still carry on to the present in  terms  of  existing  economic
inequalities between developed and developing countries. Hence, the  present
world order is regarded as  a  product  of  racism  and  is  itself  racist,
therefore the fight against racism demands redressing such inequalities.

On the other hand the  Western  countries  and  the  UN  establishment  have
different departure points  on  the  issue  of  discrimination.  Before  the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international  law  concerned  itself
only with relations amongst states  and  the  rights  and  wrongs  occurring
therein.

After such a declaration, an unprecedented breakthrough took place  in  that
it became the concern of all states how each state deals with  its  subjects
and respects their fundamental human rights. Human  rights  violations  came
to be regarded as  a  threat  to  world  security  and  peace.  Since  then,
international law on any  aspect  of  discrimination  concerns  itself  with
whether,  in  dealing  with  their  subjects,  states  practice   or   allow
discrimination of the various types identified.

Following this conference and the direction that events  in  the  conference
took, we need to consider whether a new beginning  of  looking  towards  the
future and not the past ever materialised from the  Durban  conference;  and
whether the conference offered the opportunity of postulating and  embracing
universal principles of international co-operation, mutual assistance and  a
collegial promotion of social justice, which are  the  right  principles  to
which humanity must aspire, and which are certainly  not  based  largely  on
the grounds of past grievances.

Subsequent to this conference in Durban, therefore, there  are  expectations
that a new world order must emerge.  Therefore,  it  is  important  that  we
should ask ourselves: What did the conference do  for  us?  Obviously,  time
will tell. The conference highlighted  the  need  for  building  bridges  to
create a better mutual understanding among all  nations  of  the  world.  We
trust that the fruits of such a world  conference  against  racism  will  be
realised by all nations that attended the conference. [Applause.]

Mr W G MAKANDA: Madam Speaker, Deputy  President,  hon  members,  the  South
African Government  hosted  the  United  Nations  World  Conference  against
Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and  Related  Intolerance.  During
the run-up to the conference, it  became  apparent  that  there  was  a  big
divide between the definitions of racism and the identities  of  states  and
people thought to be guilty of racism.

These fundamental differences threatened the outcome of the conference  even
before it began, because the  United  States,  in  solidarity  with  Israel,
threatened to  join  the  latter  and  withdraw  its  participation  in  the
conference if Israel was accused of racism  in  its  ongoing  conflict  with
Palestine.

The European Union countries shared these reservations about the  accusation
of Israel of racism, and this  contributed  to  the  emergence  of  a  major
global divide that was to  impact  seriously  on  the  achievements  of  the
conference. Not surprisingly, the differences in what was to be included  in
the conference agenda and  in  the  substantive  issues  in  the  conference
itself reflect the chasm that  separates  the  developed  North,  which  has
traditionally been associated with worse forms of racism, on the  one  hand,
and the underdeveloped South, which has largely been the victim  of  racism,
xenophobia and intolerance, on the other.

The big divide between the developed and the  developing  nations  expressed
itself at the UN world  conference  in  their  divergent  understanding  and
interpretations  of  the  Palestinian-Israeli  conflict.  The  majority   of
nonaligned countries believe that racism characterises the  conflict,  which
is reminiscent of apartheid's racist and Balkanisationist  policies  of  the
past, in the context of aggressive Israeli militarism.

The European and American power bloc, while occasionally chastising  Israeli
excesses is, on the whole, protective towards Israel and does  not  perceive
the latter's aggression with the same poignancy.

In this era of a new democratic and nonracist South Africa, it is taken  for
granted that racism is an aberration of a  bygone  age.  References  to  the
socioeco-political  origins  of  these  tendencies  in  modern  society  are
readily dismissed by some political pundits as ``tired left-wing  cliches''.
The  reality  belies  this  illusion.  Racism,  racial  discrimination   and
xenophobia remain firmly rooted in modern societies, because there has  been
no radical transformation of the economic and social power relations in  the
national and global spheres, which have been the domain of this scourge.

This state of affairs is a consequence  of  the  continued  manipulation  of
racial, cultural and religious differences for the  exclusive  advantage  of
certain groups. The global economic disparities that define the  North-South
relationship are derived from an era that believed in  the  myth  of  racial
superiority   of   European   colonisers,   which   evolved   out   of   the
commercialisation of labour and exploitation of  natural  resources  in  the
colonies.

Oliver C Cox put it this way in his Caste, Class and Race:


  The   socioeconomic   matrix   of   racial   antagonism   involved    the
  commercialisation of human labour in the West Indies, the East Indies and
  in America,  the  intense  competition  among  businessmen  of  different
  Western European cities for the capitalist exploitation of the  resources
  of this area, the development of nationalism  and  the  consolidation  of
  European nations, and the decline of the influence of the Roman  Catholic
  Church with its mystical inhibitions to the free exploitation of economic
  resources.

Thus, racial antagonism reached full maturity during the latter half of  the
19th century.

The foundations of the structural relationship that came to link  the  North
American and European nation-states  with  their  postcolonial  counterparts
have  not  been  dislodged  by  the  transfer  of  political  power  to  the
indigenous peoples. The exercise of that  power  by  the  newly  independent
indigenous  governments  has  been  constrained  by  the  lack  of  economic
sovereignty  and  has  resulted  in  their  manipulation  by  the   powerful
economies of the North, in their own interests.

Xenophobia  is  very  much  the  consequence  of  competition   for   scarce
resources. It is imperative  that  the  United  Nations  Conference  against
Racism should focus on promoting accelerated development of the Third  World
economies  to  facilitate  wealth  creation   as   a   reinsurance   against
xenophobia.

The new partnership for Africa's development should strive to dismantle  the
power relations, and build a  continental  capacity  to  contribute  to  the
development of a viable  and  mutually  beneficial  economic  order  of  the
world. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I wish to  acknowledge  and  recognise  the
presence in our midst of the representatives from the Majlis  of  Kazakhstan
who are visiting our Parliament. You are welcome, hon  members.  [Applause.]
Thank you for visiting us. 

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, hon Ministers and members, in a historic  sense
hosting the conference in  South  Africa  provided  a  symbolic  gesture  of
directing a process from apartheid to reconciliation and  racial  tolerance.
It was proper for the Conference against Racism to be held in South  Africa,
because of our recent  history  and,  moreover,  because  of  our  country's
successful peaceful political transition.

Two areas of contention that emanated from the conference indicate how  long
the road is that still needs to be travelled before the  world  is  able  to
live together in a diverse universe. The  one  issue  was  the  Middle  East
conflict, and the other equally contentious issue was the  call  by  African
states for apology and possible reparation for the  issue  of  slavery.  The
question we have to ask is whether we managed to  bridge  these  divides  at
this conference. Unfortunately, we have to admit that  the  world  is  still
poorer in its capacity to deal effectively with these issues.

In an ironic way it took the 11 September attack on  America  to  witness  a
fresh approach to the Israel-Palestinian issue. This means  that  Israel  is
now being asked to reconsider its  occupation  of  Palestine.  In  the  same
context, we have also come to witness  the  fight  against  terrorism  on  a
global scale.

The agenda for world political action still  remains  illusive  for  gaining
equitable solutions as the divide between the  powerful  and  less  powerful
nations  still  bring  about  problems  in  understanding  globally   shared
interests. Africa with its dire need for  reparation  and  development  will
have to look to itself for recovering from racism and economic  deprivation.
We believe in the principle of restorative justice, and if  applied  in  the
area of racism, it could bring about a new constructive  way  of  addressing
racism, not only in Africa, but throughout the world. [Applause.]

Dr J BENJAMIN: Madam Speaker, hon members, Deputy President, first  of  all,
I want to thank Parliament for giving me the opportunity to  participate  in
the World Conference against Racism, Xenophobia and Related Intolerances.

Before the conference, I was concerned that these conferences happen in  our
country  and,  as  parliamentarians,  we  are  not  afforded  a  chance   to
participate. It was a very educational and enriching experience  for  me  to
participate in that conference.

What I saw when I got to the World Conference was that  the  masses  of  the
world were streaming into South  Africa  to  pay  tribute  to  what  we  had
achieved in this country - the way in which we had proceeded  peacefully  in
our transition to democracy. The people who came  there  were  from  diverse
backgrounds. They were mostly people who  identified  with  the  victims  of
racism all over the world. There were people from India -  the  Dalits  from
India - and other people from Tibet. There were people  who  were  emotional
about their causes, and this conference afforded  them  the  opportunity  to
express themselves, even if in their own countries they were at war.

We must give South Africa and the World  Conference  against  Racism  credit
that  these  opportunities  were  afforded  to  people  who,  in  their  own
contexts, could not in fact express themselves peacefully.  I  therefore  do
not see it as a problem that there were  people  from  Palestine  expressing
themselves, people from Israel expressing themselves, and people from  Tibet
and various other countries expressing themselves  in  the  true  spirit  of
democracy within that conference.

Most of the people who came there were also the people who  participated  in
the world struggle against racism. They participated in the  first  and  the
second United Nations' Conference against Racism, and  they  had  encouraged
their governments to get involved and take a  stand  against  apartheid  and
racism in this  country.  They  had  eventually  managed  to  get  sanctions
against the apartheid regime and helped us obtain our freedom.
Therefore, I cannot understand when the members of the  opposition  such  as
the hon Dene Smuts say on a number of occasions that hosting the  conference
in South Africa was a waste of time and money. On the contrary,  the  masses
of the world came to South Africa to pay tribute to us for the way in  which
we resolved our conflicts in this country, and also to acknowledge, as  much
as the opposition does not want to acknowledge it, the  role  that  we  have
played and continue to play in the world in  the  struggle  against  racism,
and the dehumanising effects of racism.

Slavery, colonialism and apartheid were systems  which  caused  millions  of
people  to  become  dehumanised.  Even  today,  all  over  the  world,   but
particularly today in  our  country,  we  still  see  the  effects  of  this
dehumanising experience.

At the NGO conference, the ANC had a series of  workshops  which  were  very
well  attended  by  democrats  from  all  over   the   world,   particularly
intellectuals from Africa. At this conference, our Deputy Speaker  presented
a paper on the evolution of the gender experience with regard to racism -  I
cannot remember the title right now.

The  point  that  I  want  to  emphasise  here,  because  it  is  not  often
acknowledged, is the experience of the Cape Peninsula in  terms  of  the  15
000 slave women who were imported to the Western Cape. Those women were  the
foremothers of the people of the Western Cape.  Those  women  were  sexually
exploited and subjected to hard labour. When  slavery  was  abolished,  they
were used to breed slaves. Last year at  the  national  conference,  a  Prof
Williams from the United States referred  to  the  third  President  of  the
United States, Thomas Jefferson, who was recently found or  proved  to  have
fathered one of his slave children, but it is thought that he  fathered  all
six; and he also wrote a book on how to breed better stock in your slaves.

Those women did not have a way to resist, except for individual slave  women
who fought endless court battles in order to obtain  freedom.  It  was  only
later, with industrialisation,  when  men  went  to  the  mines  that  women
started to become organised. Later, when women went into the labour  market,
there were many women who through the trade  unions  became  organised  into
politics. Some of those women found their way  into  this  Parliament,  such
as, for example, Ms Liz Abrahams and Ray Alexander.

These were the women  who  got  involved  in  organised  politics.  The  ANC
Women's League also got involved  in  organising  people  to  fight  against
racism in the national struggle for liberation. As women got involved,  they
also fought against sexism in this country. Therefore the conference  looked
at the way in which racism and sexism are  inter-linked.  So  through  those
struggles so much was done in the interest of advancing gender equality,  so
much so that today we lead the world in terms of  the  number  of  women  we
have in Parliament and how far  we  have  gone  in  achieving  equality  for
women.

A number of members of the opposition  who  have  spoken  here  today  still
cannot see what good hosting this conference has done for  South  Africa.  I
can only go back to what the President said about the two  nations  in  this
country, that is those who bear the brunt of racism, and those who fight  in
order to maintain the privileges of the white minority  in  this  country  -
and that is the only way I can describe people  who  cannot  understand  how
this country was chosen, and that it was not a waste of  time  or  money  to
host the conference in this country.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mevrou die Speaker, daar kan tereg  gevra  word  of  dit
werklik 'n mors van geld was of nie. Dit gaan nie noodwendig daaroor of  dit
'n mors van geld was of nie, maar oor die  finansiële  prioriteite  van  die
Regering in Suid-Afrika.

Met verwysing na die rassekonferensie kan daar met reg  gevra  word  of  die
geld nie anders aangewend kon word vir 'n beter  lewe  vir  almal  in  Suid-
Afrika nie. Moderne menseregte ná 1945  het  met  die  klem  op  individuele
regte begin. Vandag het die klem na groeps- en minderheidsregte verskuif.

Die VF het die rassekonferensie in Durban bygewoon, om die  waarheid  te  sê
was hy die enigste opposisieparty wat  daar  was.  Dit  is  jammer  dat  die
Israel-Palestinasaak die konferensie so oorheers  het.  As  dié  saak  egter
buite rekening  gelaat  word,  het  die  konferensie  eintlik  gehandel  oor
minderhede. Dit  is  minderhede  wat  in  die  wêreld  onderdruk  word.  Die
uitstallings by die konferensie het dit veel duideliker gestel.

Die Tamil van Sri Lanka wat selfbeskikking wil  hê  en  wat  tans  onderdruk
word, was daar. Die mense van Tibet wat selfbeskikking wil hê  en  wat  deur
China onderdruk word, was daar. Die Indiane van  Kanada  wat  selfbeskikking
wil hê, was daar. As Suid-Afrika een les uit die konferensie  kan  leer,  is
dit dat 'n ware en moderne demokrasie nie  net  oor  meerderhede  gaan  nie,
maar juis minderhede in ag neem.

'n Demokrasie wat nie minderhede in ag neem en minderheidsregte  erken  nie,
kan vandag nie as 'n moderne demokrasie beskou word nie. Daarop  sê  die  VF
selfbeskikking  en  minderheidsregte,  ook  vir  Afrikaners,  het  niks  met
rassisme te doen nie, maar erken net die kulturele  en  etniese  werklikhede
van Suid-Afrika en die wêreld op  'n  realistiese  manier.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, one could rightly ask whether or  not  it
was, in fact, a waste of money. It is not necessarily about whether  or  not
it was a waste of money, but rather about the financial  priorities  of  the
Government in South Africa.

With reference to the racism conference one could rightly  ask  whether  the
money could not have been applied differently for a better life for  all  in
South Africa. Modern human rights after 1945  began  with  the  emphasis  on
individual rights. Today the emphasis has  shifted  to  group  and  minority
rights.

The FF attended the racism conference in Durban, in fact, it  was  the  only
opposition party present. It is  a  pity  that  the  Israel-Palestine  issue
dominated the conference to such an extent. If this issue  is  left  out  of
the equation, however, the conference actually dealt with minorities.  These
are minorities that are oppressed in  the  world.  The  exhibitions  at  the
conference stated this much more clearly.

The Tamils of Sri Lanka who want self-determination and  who  are  currently
oppressed were present. The people of Tibet who want self-determination  and
who are being oppressed by China were there. The Indians of Canada who  want
self-determination were there. If South Africa can  learn  one  lesson  from
this conference, it is that a true and modern democracy is  not  only  about
majorities, but that it in fact takes minorities into consideration.

A democracy that does not take minorities into consideration  and  recognise
minority rights, cannot be regarded as a  modern  democracy  today.  The  FF
therefore contends that self-determination and  minority  rights,  also  for
Afrikaners, have nothing  to  do  with  racism,  but  merely  recognise  the
cultural and ethnic realities of South Africa and the world in  a  realistic
manner.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI:  Madam  Speaker  and  hon  members,  the  World  Conference
against Racism identified slavery and colonialism as sources of racism.

It is common knowledge that slave masters never  had  slaves  of  their  own
kind  and  race.  This  is  a  manifestation  of  racial  discrimination.  A
challenge remains for some of our people - some of them in this House -  who
turned their black employees into slaves in this modern day. The poor  wages
they pay these people, the inhumane treatment they  are  subjected  to,  and
the deplorable conditions that they work under and live  in  do  not  behave
people with human rights.  Such  treatment  is  meted  out  to  them  simply
because of their race.

It was at the same conference that women from  Africa  held  a  meeting  and
observed  that  colonialism  was  a  fundamental  cause  of  racism.  It  is
unacceptable that in this modern day slavery of African women  continues  in
the form of trafficking women and young girls to Europe and the Middle  East
where they  are  used  as  sex  and  work  slaves  in  the  most  deplorable
conditions without payment.
Therefore, it is incumbent upon political parties  to  desist  from  playing
the race card or showing intolerance  to  any  perceived  dissent  by  other
parties. This Parliament has, in an effort to level the playing field,  gone
to great lengths to put in place pieces of  legislation  that  seek  to  put
paid  to  racial  discrimination,  racism,  xenophobia  and  other   related
intolerances.

South Africans of all hues and backgrounds should  live  side  by  side  and
show the world that we have realised Martin  Luther  King  Jr's  dream.  Our
children  play  side  by  side  as  young  South  Africans.  With  the  same
legislative instruments and others on hand, there is no need  for  one  race
group to look down upon others. All people have a place under the  sun.  Let
us hope that the lessons learnt from the  World  Conference  against  Racism
will take root in our society.

While we decry the conduct of the US delegation in the run-up to and at  the
conference, we should bear in mind that human beings  are  not  like  rivers
which flow in  the  same  direction  depending  on  the  topography  of  the
country. Human beings differ and hold different opinions which  have  to  be
tolerated. May we rise to the clarion call of the World  Conference  against
Racism and eradicate racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia  and  related
intolerance.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, the World Conference against Racism  did  not
achieve what was expected of a conference of this  international  magnitude.
The nation did not speak with one voice, nor did the continent of Africa.

Important issues which affect Africa, such as  reparations  for  the  trans-
Atlantic slave trade, colonialism  and  the  foreign  debt  were  sidelined.
Landlessness of indigenous people and their colonial dispossession  -  which
is genocide and has resulted in  the  disappearance  and  reduction  of  the
populations of the indigenous people in  many  parts  of  the  world  -  was
totally ignored even when some delegates spoke of the  landlessness  of  the
indigenous populations as a form of racism.

Racism is a global power system. It  was  the  renowned  European  historian
Basil Davidson who wrote that the racism which we know  today  was  born  in
Europe and the United States of America, from the cultural need  to  justify
doing to black people, especially  Africans,  what  could  not  morally  and
legally be done to European people.

Cecil Rhodes, that arch agent of British imperialism, said:


  I contend that we are the first race in the world, that the more world we
  inhabit, the better it is for the human race. I contend that  every  acre
  of our territory provides for the birth of the English race  and  greater
  portion of the world under our rule.

Yet, many originators of racism in the world  boycotted  the  conference  or
demanded conditions which  ignored  racism.  Those  who  turned  up  at  the
conference hijacked the conference.  Critical  issues  affecting  those  who
have been victims of racism were put  aside.  Poverty  and  underdevelopment
were merely paid lip service. We were told to  forget  about  the  past  and
concentrate on today's situation. Yet, to  this  day  the  Nazis  are  still
hunted by the Jews and punished for their crimes.

The PAC holds that racism will not be eliminated in heterogeneous  societies
for as long as the extreme wealth sit  side-by-side  with  extreme  poverty,
and the world is divided between the haves and the have-nots.

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker,  I  listened  carefully  to  what  the  ANC
speakers and the Minister have said in trying to explain to us what a  great
success the conference was. One does not have to explain  man's  ability  to
fly. One experiences and sees it nowadays. Boeing shows it to us. Why do  we
constantly  have  to  come  and  tell  people  that  it  was  such  a  great
conference? Why do we not experience it in South Africa? [Interjections.]

Wanneer  die  ANC  en  sy  mederegeerders  nie  hulle  parlementêre  program
behoorlik kan uitvoer nie, dan  kom  hulle  met  namaalse  besprekings  soos
hierdie van vanmiddag, om in te vul in dit  wat  hulle  nie  wil  doen  nie.
Watter sin maak dit om drie maande ná so 'n konferensie hier  te  kom  staan
en vir ons te wil vertel hoe wonderlik dit was? Dit  nadat  ons  gesien  het
wat in Washington en in  New  York  gebeur.  Dit  nadat  ons  sien  wat  nou
wêreldwyd met antraks gebeur. Dit wanneer ons sien hoe die  vrou  sukkel  om
te lewe in Afghanistan en die onderdrukking waardeur sy gaan,  dan  is  daar
mos nie sukses om van  te  praat  nie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  So  erg  het  die
Durbankonferensie die denke van sommige van ons  mense  besoedel  dat  hulle
teruggekom  het  en  Mev  Helen  Suzman  se  volgelinge  as  rassiste  begin
bestempel het.

In die twee minute wat die ANC my toelaat om 'n toespraak te  maak,  wil  ek
die konferensie as volg opsom: Die  ANC  wou  hul  alliansievennote  tevrede
stel, deurdat Cosatu en die SAKP,  wat  sedert  1994  aansien  verloor  het,
geleentheid gegee is om gesien en gehoor te  word  by  hierdie  konferensie.
Rassistiese groeperings van die wêreld het die konferensie misbruik vir  eie
gewin en die Suid-Afrikaanse belastingbetaler moes  vir  die  Durbanvakansie
betaal. Parlementêre werksaamhede  is  tydens  die  konferensie  ontwrig  en
vandag  word  ons  produktiwiteit  weer  op   dieselfde   manier   belemmer.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[When the ANC  and  its  co-rulers  cannot  carry  out  their  parliamentary
programme properly, then they come with belated discussions, like  this  one
this afternoon, to fill in for what they do not want to do. What sense  does
it make, three months after such a conference, to come and  stand  here  and
tell us how wonderful it was? This after  we  have  seen  what  happened  in
Washington and in New York. This after having seen  what  is  happening  now
globally  with  anthrax.  When  we  see  how  women  struggle  to  live   in
Afghanistan and the repression they have  to  suffer,  surely  there  is  no
success to speak of. [Interjections.] So severely did the Durban  conference
pollute the minds of some of our people that they  came  back  and  regarded
Mrs Helen Suzman's followers as racists.

In the two minutes that the ANC allows me to deliver a  speech,  I  want  to
sum up the conference as follows: The ANC wanted to  please  their  alliance
partners, to give an opportunity to Cosatu and the SACP, who have lost  face
since 1994, to be seen and to be heard at this conference. Racist  groupings
of the world exploited the conference for  their  own  gain  and  the  South
African  taxpayer  had  to  pay  for  the  Durban   holiday.   Parliamentary
activities were disrupted and today our productivity is  being  hampered  in
the same way.]

The ANC claims that it is ready to govern. Can  they  claim  that  they  are
ready to govern when they cannot lead us away from racism  and  intolerance?
What are they going to tell their neighbour, Mr Mugabe? Have they taken  him
out of this racist mode  of  governance?  It  is  obvious  that  the  Durban
conference was a failure. [Interjections.] [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, may  I  start  with  a  quotation  from  the
Minister's report:


  South Africa, not so long ago, was a fountain of racism and the venue was
  well-chosen for the racism conference.

How right she is. [Applause.] Many nations made  their  presence  known  and
chose to embark on efforts to mend the past injustices and  put  an  end  to
the injustices of the present  and  reach  consensus  so  as  to  avoid  the
repetition of these horrors. Having concluded the conference  a  while  back
now, views have been focused  on  the  outcomes  and  suggestions  regarding
which the MF has made its support known.

It is now time to put  our  mechanics  to  work,  be  it  an  effort  for  a
domestic, national, international or global cleanup. We have  to  voice  our
support and then, too, only not voice our support but also substantiate  the
support with action.

Our Constitution has led us on this path since 1996,  and  our  achievements
have been many. As part of all humanity, is it not our duty then  to  ensure
that the protection we are given by  our  Constitution  and  especially  the
Bill of Rights should be observed and adopted globally, not in  policies  in
respect of many diversities, but rather in terms of the respect  and  honour
accorded to an individual as a human being who is naturally entitled  to  it
from birth.

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, world events were dominated in  such  a  way  by
the events of 11 September that the UN Conference  against  Racism  held  in
Durban in August is nearly forgotten. Expectations were high. Today,  a  few
months and R90 million of taxpayers' money later, it is appropriate to do  a
postmortem.

We  must  remember  that  it  was  a  UN  Conference  and  not  one  of  the
Government's  conferences.  Three  positive  aspects  should,  however,   be
mentioned regarding South Africa's performance. We need to congratulate  our
security   industry.   Despite   protests   and   some   aggressive   public
participation, only one serious  event  of  a  rather  personal  nature  was
recorded.

We give recognition for the conciliatory role the South  African  delegation
played in trying to be part of the solution and  not  the  problem.  It  was
quite a surprise to me  that  perhaps  the  most  undiplomatic  Minister  in
Parliament turned out to be a formidable diplomat in her role  as  president
of the conference. There is an Afrikaans saying applicable to  our  Minister
of Foreign Affairs: ``Op straat is jy 'n engel, juis, maar wees dit tog  ook
tuis.''[On the street you are an angel, indeed, but please be like  that  at
home as well.]

President Mbeki's approach  of  ``trade  rather  than  aid''  must  also  be
supported. Instead of a one-sided call for reparation, the call  for  active
participation  in  the  Millennium   African   Recovery   Plan   should   be
appreciated.

Wat die res van die konferensie betref, was die ondertoon gans te  negatief,
eensydig, polariserend. So lank as wat sekere  lande  simplisties  dink  die
res van die wêreld is vir hul probleme  verantwoordelik,  gaan  hulle  nooit
uit die blokke kom nie.
So lank as wat konferensies soos hierdie ontaard in  'n  vertoon  van  ``the
good, the bad and the ugly'', van die ``cowboys'' en die ``crooks'', met  'n
selektiewe  klagstaat  van  die  Derde  Wêreld  teen  die  Eerste,  sal  dit
teenproduktief  bly  en   eerder   die   klowe   vergroot.   'n   Misplaaste
skuldsindroom maak meesal  van  'n  individu  'n  onproduktiewe  mislukking.
Dieselfde geld vir 'n land.

In hierdie opsig was die konferensie  'n  mislukte,  polariserende  oefening
wat so in die verlede vasgehaak het dat  weinig  positief  vir  die  toekoms
bewerkstellig is. Dit is nie net 11 September  wat  hierdie  konferensie  'n
vergete deel van die geskiedenis gemaak het nie. (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[As regards the rest of the conference, its  undertone  was  altogether  too
negative,  one-sided,  polarising.  As  long   as   some   countries   think
simplistically that the rest of the world is to blame for  their  woes  they
will never get out of the starting blocks.

As long as conferences such as this one degenerate into a display  of  ``the
good, the bad and the  ugly'',  of  the  cowboys  and  the  crooks,  with  a
selective charge sheet of the Third World  against  the  First  World,  they
will remain counterproductive and instead widen the gaps. A misplaced  guilt
syndrome usually turns an individual into an unproductive failure. The  same
applies to a country.

In this regard the conference was a failed, polarising  exercise  which  got
so  bogged  down  in  the  past  that  very  little  that  is  positive  was
accomplished for the future. It was not only 11 September that  turned  this
conference into a forgotten part of history.]

The MINISTER FOR THE  PUBLIC  SERVICE  AND  ADMINISTRATION:  Madam  Speaker,
members of this House, our President, in his opening address  at  the  World
Conference against Racism, stated:


  We are meeting here because we have said to ourselves that since  poverty
  is not an act of nature, but the product of human society,  we  must,  as
  this  human  society,   fight   together   and   vanquish   poverty   and
  underdevelopment.

Indeed, as South Africans,  we  know  well  how  human  action  could  cause
unbearable suffering and long-lasting legacies of inequality, the  waves  of
which we are still riding today. I think today is an opportunity -  and  the
racism conference once again offered us an opportunity - to reflect  on  how
we have dealt with  the  erosive  effects  of  racial  policy  and  societal
discrimination.

There are moments, however, when we pause and ask: Is our  country  or  some
forces in our country really ready to confront and uproot racism? And as  we
listened to some individuals today, regrettably we have  to  say  that  some
individuals have not been able to either ride that wave or go that route.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs just stated earlier today  in  this  debate,
and I quote:


  There was never any doubt in my mind that those who visited  this  untold
  harm and humiliation on Africans  would  not  accept  responsibility  for
  their actions. What was even more important was an attempt to reduce this
  pain to which the Africans were subjected into a money game.

Regrettably, in this House today, we see it once again, and I  think  it  is
shameful. I would like to go further and state that we have also  seen  once
again today that issues pertaining to race which in  the  past  have  always
constituted the organising principle of the  South  African  landscape  also
veers to the fore in  instances  in  the  presentation  by  members  of  the
opposition, and the sad thing is they do not even see it. The hon  Moorcroft
was one of those examples.

It came in the guise of parties advocating the exclusion of the majority  of
people from the political dispensation or  offering  parallel  institutional
arrangements, as in the past, with the NP or the liberals  and  now  pseudo-
liberals, as it was with the PFP, DP and more  recently  DA,  who  will  not
necessarily  use  outright  racist  language,  but  who  are  resisting  the
fundamental transformation of the effects of perpetual racist behaviour.

This  includes  the  extremely  large  gap,  in   terms   of   socioeconomic
conditions, experienced  on  a  daily  basis  and  particularly  the  racial
patterns that these assume in our society. They even refuse to  discuss  the
issue of race and are bold in that, as we heard through  the  hon  Moorcroft
today. And, as we recently observed in ANC Today, and I quote:


  Current racial ideology in South Africa includes ideas and practices that
  endorse the notion that racial discrimination  and  prejudice  no  longer
  pose a significant social problem. Some argue that since  the  attainment
  of formal equality, the main racial problem in society is that blacks are
  becoming too demanding  and  that  their  demands  unfairly  disadvantage
  whites. Such arguments overlook or seek to deny the  continuing  patterns
  of racial inequality in our country and the world. And  at  the  apex  of
  such views is the idea that even to discuss the  question  of  racism  is
  itself an act of racism.

Then, of course, we have parties who make no bones about the fact that  they
represent the very particular  interests  of  specific  ethnic  groups.  The
challenge, of course, for these groupings  is  to  assert  the  interest  of
their narrow constituencies, without assuming blatant racist  positions  and
becoming obstacles to the larger transformation agenda of this country.

However, throughout the better part of the past 90 years, there is  and  has
been only one political voice, and  that  is  the  ANC,  which  unwaveringly
advocated the position for nonracialism. [Applause.]  The  approach  of  the
ANC-led liberation movement was one that clearly  reflected  our  commitment
that South Africa belongs to everyone, black and  white.  This  has  been  a
fundamental  principle  underpinning  this  democracy  of  nonracialism  and
nonsexism.

Ours has never been the  revengeful  response  that  Shylock,  the  Jew,  in
Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, cautioned about when he said:


  ``... if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like  you  in  the
  rest, we will resemble you in that ... The villainy you teach me, I  will
  execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction''.

In the course of our colonial and apartheid  history,  our  people  resisted
assaults on their dignity, but they never surrendered to the  temptation  of
advocating black racial domination. Instead, they showed that they were  not
like Shylock from The Merchant of Venice. I  think  many  should  listen  to
that. In responding to a system that sought to  deny  the  humanity  of  our
people, the ANC has drawn consistently and unwaveringly  on  the  principles
of nonracism, nonsexism, and the transition to democracy was  a  product  of
the struggles of our people.

I want to tell the hon  member  that  the  defining  feature  of  the  ANC's
approach to nonracialism was not clumsy. It was  based  on  our  efforts  to
build a future in the present through  united  action.  This  is  what  will
guide us through the choice of forming any  co-operative  arrangements  with
any other party in this  House.  The  action  that  we  seek  is  not  empty
rhetoric on issues of racism and nonracialism. The action that  we  seek  is
that which is directed at waging war against poverty in this country.

The day that we are no longer able to distinguish between two nations  which
show the common fault lines along racial and economic  dimensions,  the  day
that the humanity of all our people  is  restored,  not  withstanding  race,
gender, religion, class etc, that is the  day  we  will  have  achieved  our
objectives. As our President previously stated:


  All our parties, and all of us as members of Parliament, shall be  judged
  by the people as having been good or bad or of no  meaning,  not  by  our
  eloquency in this Chamber, not by our agility  in  parliamentary  debate,
  nor yet by the  skill  with  which  we  outsmart  our  real  or  imagined
  opponents. We shall be found to have been good or bad or of no meaning by
  the extent to which we  use  the  positions  of  power  which  we  occupy
  actually to improve the quality of life of our people.

Over the past three weeks, South Africans have been exposed  to  the  crisis
in the DA. We are dealing with  tricky  national  issues,  induced  identity
dynamics but to mention a few. The current crisis in the DA, while this  may
be precipitated by the actions of the leader of the DA, should not  be  seen
in a social vacuum. The crisis is essentially a  reflection  of  changes  in
the sociopolitical environment, and I believe it was inevitable.

It is the mentality of coloniser and the imperialist that is imbued  in  the
organisational culture of the DP that  lies  at  the  heart  of  DA  breakup
[Applause.] It lies in the inability of people who belong to that  party  to
buy into the shared vision and shared values  base  that  many  of  us  have
developed in this House, that we find the root of the demise of the DA,  and
that will make them increasingly  irrelevant.  Their  inability  to  seek  a
dispensation that will benefit the majority of people in  our  society,  and
their inability to break the mind-set of white superiority within their  own
organisation and structures, make such  people  a  nuisance  factor,  as  we
strive to achieve the ideals that this  country  has  opted  to  pursue,  as
captured in our Constitution.

Chief Albert Luthuli captured the white superiority  complex  well  in  1961
when he stated:


  Few white people escape corruption, and many of their children  learn  to
  believe that white men are unquestionably  superior,  efficient,  clever,
  industrious and  capable,  that  black  men  are  equally  unquestionably
  inferior, slothful, stupid, evil and clumsy.

That is the mentality that still continues. That is the uneasiness and deep-
seated cultural tension that is prevalent and has never been fully  resolved
within the DA and its formations. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Wanneer ons die geskiedenis van die Afrikaners  in  hierdie  land  versigtig
ontleed, dan moet ons die afgelope paar weke  se  verwikkelinge  nie  as  'n
verrassing   beskou   nie.   Die   Afrikaners    bring    met    hulle    'n
pioniersgeskiedenis  waar  die  onbekende  en  die  moeilike   nie   as   'n
afskrikmiddel dien om vooruitgang te maak nie. Dink maar net aan  die  berge
in die Boland: Watter motivering moes dit nie  geneem  het  om  dit  oor  te
steek  nie?  Die  spreekwoorde  in  die   Afrikaanse   taal   vang   hierdie
lewensbenaderinge vas: ``'n boer maak 'n plan'',  ``voeg  die  daad  by  die
woord'' en ``die hand aan die ploeg slaan''.

Regdeur die geskiedenis waar die Afrikaners  aan  'n  saak  geglo  het,  het
hulle alles ingesit om dit te laat gebeur. Ons moet nie uit die oog  verloor
dat die Afrikaners ook 'n geneigdheid het om te twis en  baklei  nie.  Hulle
aanvaar moeilik 'n ander se leierskap  en  hulle  politieke  geskiedenis  is
deursprek met splintering, skeiding en duplisering.  Nieteenstaande  hierdie
negatiewe eienskap is ons daarvan oortuig dat die  Afrikaners  'n  geweldige
rol in die toekoms van hierdie land kan speel.

Dit sal net gebeur sodra hulle by die punt uitkom waar hulle nie  langer  na
hulle eie belange omsien nie, maar waar hulle hulself as integraal  gekoppel
sien aan die lot van hierdie land en al sy mense. Die punt waar empatie  wat
hulle vir hul eie armes gehad het, ook die empatie word van  die  armes  wat
hulle beleid van diskriminasie en apartheid agtergelaat het, die  punt  waar
hulle die visie van wat ons vir hierdie land het, gaan  glo  en  nie  langer
gevangenes gaan wees van vrese en drogbeelde wat hulle koester oor  die  ANC
nie, of waar hulle hul toekoms gaan soek in die uithoeke van die  Noord-Kaap
of in die arms van liberale magte wat hulle  eie  eksklusiwiteit  nog  altyd
met geld verseker het nie. Dit gaan die  oomblik  wees  wat  as  katalisator
gaan dien vir die  groot  en  positiewe  verandering.  Dit  gaan  wees  soos
wanneer een van daardie sleutelstukke in die legkaart  uiteindelik  sy  plek
kry. Ewe skielik is daar  ook  sommer  tientalle  ander  stukke  wat  sommer
vanself hul plek sal vind. [Applous.] (Translation of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[When we carefully analyse the history of the Afrikaners in this country  we
should not regard the developments of the past few weeks as a surprise.  The
Afrikaners bring with them a pioneering history where the  unknown  and  the
difficult do not serve as a deterrent to make progress. Just  think  of  the
mountains in the Boland: What motivation it must have taken to  cross  those
mountains. The proverbs in the Afrikaans language capture  these  approaches
to life: ``'n boer maak 'n plan'' [farmers  are  enterprising],  ``voeg  die
daad by die woord'' [to put the action to the word] and ``die hand  aan  die
ploeg slaan'' [to put one's hand to the plough].

Right through history where the Afrikaners believed  in  a  cause  they  put
everything into it to make it happen. Let us not  lose  sight  of  the  fact
that the Afrikaners also have a tendency of feud  and  fight.  They  do  not
accept  another's  leadership  easily  and  their   political   history   is
interspersed with splintering, separation and  duplication.  Notwithstanding
this negative quality we are convinced  that  the  Afrikaners  can  play  an
immense role in the future of this country.

This will only happen when they reach the point where they  no  longer  only
look after their own interests, but where they see themselves as  integrally
connected to the destiny of this country  and  all  its  people.  The  point
where the empathy which they had for their own poor people also becomes  the
empathy for  the  poor  people  that  their  policy  of  discrimination  and
apartheid left behind, the point where they believe in the  vision  we  have
for this country and no longer remain prisoners of fears and phantoms  which
they harbour about the ANC, or where they seek their future  in  the  remote
areas of the Northern Cape or in the arms of liberal powers who have  always
ensured their exclusivity with money. That will be  the  moment  which  will
serve as a catalyst for the big and positive change. It will  be  like  when
one of those key pieces in the puzzle eventually slot into  place.  Suddenly
many more pieces will also slot into places. [Applause.]]
The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  Madam  Speaker,  Deputy  President,
hon members, today's debate, which is on a very important issue, once  again
highlights what we have been experiencing for some time -  the  intellectual
capacity on the  part  of  the  majority  party  and  some  members  of  the
opposition to tackle issues of profound importance to us in a  very  serious
way.

On the other hand, the DP once again exposes its intellectual bankruptcy  in
its attempt to try to deal with very burning issues  in  a  very  simplistic
and wrong way. I want to believe that 31 August to 8 September will go  down
in  history  as  a  moment  when   thousands   of   delegates   representing
governments, NGO's, and supporters  of  various  causes  gathered  in  South
Africa, which was a previous fountainhead of the worst forms of racism,  and
now a model and a beacon of hope for many.

They gathered in South Africa to acknowledge that the dangerous  spectre  of
racialism, xenophobia and other forms of  related  intolerance  is  haunting
humanity. While some of the ostriches on my  left  try  rigorously  to  deny
this, the delegates who gathered in Durban openly, sometimes  heatedly,  but
constructively, tackled the burning issues confronting us  and  resolved  to
unite as an international army against racism.

What is ironic is that those who come  from  peoples  who  have  experienced
racism  and  other  forms  of  discrimination   are   not   only   able   to
intellectually describe our experiences, but are  also  constructively  able
to put forward programmes of action to genuinely  achieve  nonracism,  while
those who pretend to be antiracists, but, who in fact, from  what  they  say
and do, reflect a very strong racist tendency, fail to acknowledge that  the
evils of racism, xenophobia and other related forms of intolerance exist.

By a strange twist of logic, Mr Moorcroft tries to  turn  the  victims  into
perpetrators of slavery and racism. He, indeed ... [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Did you listen to what he said?

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Yes, I was listening, and unfortunately  it  has  given
me a headache. [Interjections.]  Instead  of  studying  the  documents  that
emerged from the conference, the  hon  member  began  selectively  to  quote
certain magazines whose articles were written  even  before  the  government
conference  opened.   This   indicates   the   hon   member's   intellectual
ruthlessness and bankruptcy. Indeed, neither the hon member nor any  of  his
party's members even bothered to attend the  conference.  He  did  not  even
bother to study the final documents, because the  programme  of  action  and
the joint communiqué is an excellent document that leads us to unite in  the
fight against racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance.

The hon member and his party, the DP - I am glad at  last  the  New  NP  has
seen some sense and is walking away from them - refuse  to  acknowledge  the
internationally accepted view that  despite  this  being  one  of  the  most
difficult conferences ever held, it was a watershed experience in the  fight
against racism. [Interjections.] In fact, the conference  managed  to  break
the barrier of silence on many issues confronting minority  groups,  migrant
workers and other people suffering racism  and  xenophobic  actions  in  the
world.

Nobody can say that the conference did not succeed, because it is  generally
acknowledged that it did succeed. I do not know how the  hon  Moorcroft  can
stand here in all seriousness and criticise the debating  of  the  issue  of
reparations and compensation for slavery  and  colonialism.  It  had  to  be
debated, because our continent, on which millions of people were  sacrificed
on the altar of slavery and colonialism, has been suffering from the  effect
of this phenomenon. [Interjections.] Despite what the  hon  members  on  the
left are saying, the vast majority in the world  acknowledges  that  slavery
and  the  slave  trade,  including  the  transatlantic  slave  trade,   were
appalling tragedies in the history of humankind.

The vast majority of humanity has acknowledged that slavery  and  the  slave
trade are crimes against humanity and that they have  always  been  so,  and
are among the sources  of  racism,  racial  discrimination,  xenophobia  and
related intolerance. I  am  happy  that  the  conference  acknowledged  that
apartheid and genocide constitute crimes against humanity  in  international
law, and I hope that one day those who purport to be antiracist would  begin
to understand what the world had declared in Durban.

  The  conference  recognised  that   these   historical   injustices   have
contributed  to  poverty,  underdevelopment,  marginalisation   and   social
exclusion, not only in the  African  continent,  but  also  internationally.
Indeed, I want to say that under the South African chairpersonship  we  were
able to ensure that the reparations and compensation debate was  not  geared
to  trying  to  compensate  either  individuals  or  countries,  but  to  be
committed to supporting new partnerships for African development.

Again, I do not understand why the members on  my  left  can  say  that  the
Middle East issue dominated the conference and that that was wrong. How  can
we deny that the situation developing in the Middle East, in which  hundreds
of people are  dying  on  a  continuous  basis,  is  becoming  a  threat  to
international peace and security? How could we  expect  this  not  to  be  a
heated and very strong discussion in the conference?

I think that it is up to us to accept and acknowledge that despite the  fact
that the United States and the  Israeli  delegation  left  even  before  the
conference really got under way the conference emerged with a programme  and
a decision on the issue of the Middle East which  nobody  can  challenge.  I
would like to tell these imbeciles  on  my  left  that  the  conference  ...
[Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, on point of order: Even the hon  the  Deputy
Minister cannot believe that it is parliamentary to describe his  colleagues
who are sitting here on his left as imbeciles. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Madam Speaker, I withdraw and I will look for a  better
word  in  the  Oxford  Dictionary  and  it  will  mean   the   same   thing.
[Interjections.]
Let me tell my colleagues on the left that  the  conference's  programme  of
action reiterated that the Holocaust must never be  forgotten.  It  resolved
that all disputes in the Middle  East  should  be  solved  through  peaceful
means and political dialogue.  It  recognised  the  need  to  counter  anti-
Semitism  and  Islamaphobia  worldwide.  It  recognised  the  right  of  the
Palestinian people to their own state and at the same  time  recognised  the
right of Israel to exist within secure borders.

But, who in his normal intelligent mind can say that the conference  emerged
with positions that were absolutely  one-sided?  This  is  what  worries  me
about the level of intellectual bankruptcy that the colleagues  on  my  left
tend to display all the time. If they did not understand the  importance  of
that conference, I hope that 11 September  was  a  wake-up  call  for  these
ostriches who refuse to see what we  are  facing.  [Interjections.]  The  11
September event was a clear warning to anybody who  had  any  common  sense,
eyes and ears to  understand,  that  if  we  do  not  deal  with  conflicts,
especially  in  the  Middle  East,  we  will  not   deal   with   terrorism.
[Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I believe that  it  has
been previously ruled that it is unparliamentary to refer to hon members  in
terms of animals  and  other  allusions.  [Interjections.]  The  hon  Deputy
Minister is now referring to people as ostriches.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: As what?

Mr D H  M  GIBSON:  Things  like  ostriches,  baboons  and  so  on  are  all
unparliamentary. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER: No, man. I said ostriches keep their heads in the  sand
and  do  not  see  what  is  happening  above  ground.  Maybe  I   was   ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Gibson, on this one I will have  to  look  at
the Hansard.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Madam Speaker, let  me  repeat:  Ostriches  keep  their
heads  in  the  sand  and  refuse  to   acknowledge   reality.   [Laughter.]
[Interjections.] Well, if the hon member thinks that he is an ostrich,  then
let it be so. [Laughter.]

What happened on 11 September showed that if we do not deal with the  issues
raised in Durban, we will, indeed, have a world of terrorism  and  conflict.
Indeed, Durban's conference showed that the root  causes  of  terrorism  are
poverty, deprivation,  underdevelopment  and  conflict,  especially  in  the
Middle East. Therefore, these are not irrelevant issues, but issues that  we
want to confront if we want a New World Order in the  interests  of  all  of
us. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                         UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL

                  (Decision of Question on Second Reading)

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I would like  to  remind  hon  members  that  the
debate on this particular Bill has already taken place in this House.

Question put: That the Bill be read a second time.

Division demanded.

                       SHOWING OF CHARTS IN THE HOUSE
                                  (Ruling)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Before I move to notices of motion,  I
just want to make a ruling on a point of order which was raised when  I  was
presiding some time last week. During the notices of motion on  25  October,
the hon Mr Goniwe raised a point of order on whether it was  acceptable  for
the hon Rev Meshoe to show charts on the subject on which he  was  giving  a
notice of motion. Although  it  is  not  common  practice,  members  do,  on
occasion, bring objects into the House  to  make  a  particular  point  with
reference to their speech. I would discourage this approach as a  debate  is
all about a verbal exchange of views. Therefore, while I  cannot  rule  what
was done as out of  order,  I  would  appeal  to  all  members,  as  far  as
possible, to refrain from this practice.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms N V CINDI: Chairperson I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that President Thabo Mbeki embarked on a three-day state  visit
       to Mali;


  (2) further notes that Mali and South Africa  reached  an  agreement  for
       economic, social and cultural co-operation;


  (3) believes that this agreement reflects the commitment of  the  ANC-led
       Government to join  hands  with  other  African  countries  to  fight
       poverty and to work for economic prosperity and social development on
       the continent; and


  (4) welcomes the decision for co-operation between the two countries.

Adv P S SWART: Chairperson I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the continuing decline in the moral fabric of society resulting
       in an escalation in the incidents of child rape and child abuse;


  (2) expresses its horror at and condemnation of such acts, in  particular
       the recent rapes of babies as young as nine and fourteen months;


  (3) agrees that there can be no  mitigating  circumstances  preventing  a
       convicted rapist from facing the prescribed life sentence for  raping
       a child younger than 16 years;


  (4) calls on the Minister of Safety and Security to empower properly  the
       Child Protection Units with the necessary manpower and  resources  to
       protect effectively the rights of South Africa's children; and

       deeds by keeping silent when they occur within the family context.

day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1)  acknowledges  that  the  motor  vehicle  finance  scheme  has   been
       reinstated for all regional magistrates with effect from 1 July 2001;


  (2) realises that this move will boost  the  morale  among  the  regional
       magistrates and thus assist in reducing the backlog of cases; and


  (3) thanks all concerned persons, including the Minister for Justice  and
       Constitutional Development, who contributed to the resolution of this
       matter.

Mr A M MAZIYA: Chairperson I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the SA Police Service  arrested  40  persons  believed  to
       belong to a platinum-theft syndicate on Tuesday;


  (2) further notes that nine million rands' worth of this  precious  metal
       was recovered by the police;


  (3) commends the SAPS for this breakthrough; and


  (4) expresses the hope that this arrest will lead to  conviction  of  all
       involved in this criminal action.

[Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the South African rand  failed  to  benefit  from  the  US
       dollar's weakness during the past week and became a  victim  of  euro
       and sterling strength; and


  (2) calls upon the Government to retain fiscal discipline,  to  speed  up
       the process of privatisation and  to  address  the  grave  danger  of
       HIV/Aids seen within the  context  of  an  expected  global  economic
       slowdown.

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that  the  Eastern  Cape  Standing  Committee  on  Welfare  has
       received evidence that the names of at least 120 civil  servants  who
       are currently employed and receiving salaries have been found on  the
       list of people classified as ``disabled social grant beneficiaries'';


  (2) further notes that these civil servants are currently  engaged  in  a
       class action against the department for not having been paid  between
       1996 and 2000;


  (3) expresses its disgust and states that even though they were not  paid
       it does not absolve them from their corrupt behaviour;


  (4) acknowledges that this clearly indicates incompetence and  corruption
       in the Eastern Cape Social Development Department and makes a mockery
       of the two costly registration processes in the province; and


  (5) calls on the Eastern Cape Social Development Department  to  urgently
       settle this costly case and eradicate corruption at all levels.

Mr G B MAGWANISHE: Chairperson, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the ANC Youth League will host the 58th  Congress  of  the
       International Union of Socialist Youth, IUSY,  in  Johannesburg  over
       the weekend, and that the IUSY Africa Committee  meeting  will  start
       today in Johannesburg;


  (2) further notes that delegates from all progressive youth organisations
       throughout the world will discuss issues confronting young people  in
       this new global order; and


  (3) welcomes delegates to this conference and wishes them  good  luck  in
       their deliberations.
[Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the Government's intentions to transform the public  sector  to
       ensure  that  the  previously  disadvantaged  gain  equal  access  to
       empowerment opportunities;


  (2) also notes, however, that -


       (a)  there is public outcry directed particularly at  the  Department
           of  Foreign  Affairs  that  it  is  involved  in  discriminatory
           employment practices; and


       (b)  the complains revolve around allegations that a  certain  ethnic
           group is given first preference as opposed to  other  groupings;
           and


  (3)  urges  the  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  to  investigate  these
       allegations and  also  provide  a  breakdown  of  its  staff  profile
       according to the demographics of our society.

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the realignment of the political landscape can be a  normal  and
           positive development in the South African situation; and


       (b)  a simple confrontational style of opposition in  line  with  the
           Westminster system can be counterproductive, with a negative and
           polarising effect on society in  a  multicultural  country  like
           South Africa; and


  (2) further notes that the AEB -


       (a)  is in favour of a system of consociational democracy,  according
           to which the interests of all communities are represented in all
           spheres of government;


       (b)   is  of  the  opinion  that  this   representation   should   be
           constitutionally entrenched, and not be executed by way  of  co-
           option where the co-opted has to behave himself  sweetly  before
           the majority on which he always stays dependent; and


       (c)  believes that development in this direction should not happen by
           way of opportunistically pressing the panic button, but that  it
           should develop in an evolutionary, orderly manner and  with  the
           full mandate of the relevant constituency.

Chief M NONKONYANA: Chairperson, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the  Governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank,  Mr  Tito  Mboweni,
       received an award for maintaining stable macroeconomic  policies  and
       keeping low levels of inflation;
  (2) believes that this award serves as recognition  of  the  Government's
       economic policies which encourage growth and investment; and


  (3) congratulates the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Tito  Mboweni,  on
       receiving this award.

[Applause.]

Ms J A SEMPLE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the 7th World Wilderness Conference has been held in  Port
       Elizabeth this week;


  (2) congratulates the organisers on  obtaining  internationally  renowned
       speakers and overseas delegates at a time when  international  travel
       is severely curtailed;


  (3) acknowledges  the  showcasing  of  the  Eastern  Cape  as  a  tourist
       destination; and


  (4) urges the Government to act in proclaiming  the  Baviaanskloof  as  a
       proclaimed wilderness area as soon as possible.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House, in view of the desire to  promote  ubuntu  to  strengthen
  different cultures and respect for one another in our country -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the tendency for matric farewells to become costly affairs  with
           expensive cars taking matriculants to posh venues; and


       (b)  the extent to which the matric dance dress competition sponsored
           by the Sunday Times  fuels  this  trend  to  keep  up  with  the
           Joneses; and


  (2) calls on large  publishing  houses  to  introduce  competitions  that
       reward matriculants, as individuals or groups, who do most to promote
       mutual tolerance and the spirit of ubuntu.

Mrs N D MBOMBO: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a child rapist was sentenced for life in Pretoria;


       (b)  a 17-year-old teenager was arrested for raping a  three-year-old
           child in Umtata; and
       (c)  the ANC Women's  League  organised  a  nationwide  mass  protest
           against child abuse over the weekend;


  (2) further notes that the Human Rights Commission intends to  release  a
       report on child abuse;


  (3) believes that child abuse practices are evil  and  must  be  uprooted
       from our society;


  (4) further notes that communities need to co-operate with the police  in
       fighting this evil crime; and


  (5) welcomes the sentence imposed by the Pretoria court.

[Applause.]
Mr A BLAAS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting  day
of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the plight of disabled workers in the light of the following:


       (a)  disabled workers, amongst them qualified artisans,  employed  by
           the service products factories, within the Sheltered  Employment
           Scheme, struggle to survive due to wages paid in the  region  of
           R1 400 a month;


       (b)  these workers receive no medical aid or pension benefits; and


       (c)  after numerous requests  and  years  of  negotiations  with  the
           Government no positive action has been taken in this regard; and


  (2) calls on the Government to address the plight of disabled workers  as
       a matter of urgency.

Mr D G MKONO: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:
  That the House -


  (1) expresses its disgust at the alarming rate of  baby  and  child  rape
       cases during the past two weeks;


  (2) expresses its shock at the fact that five more cases  of  child  rape
       have been reported in the Eastern Cape, North West and Mpumalanga;


  (3) notes that many of these rapes are committed by  criminals  known  to
       the family, and takes cognisance of the effect of  HIV/Aids  in  rape
       cases;


  (4) calls on the Government to urgently implement a national co-ordinated
       strategy to deal with the  uniqueness  of  crimes  committed  against
       children, in order to  protect  our  future  generations  from  hurt,
       trauma and life-long scares; and


  (5)  further  calls  on   the   Government   to   implement   legislation
       criminalising the intentional spreading of HIV/Aids.

Mrs D G NHLENGETHWA: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the statement of the Minister of Public Works, the  hon  Stella
       Sigcau, during here imbizo visit in Mpumalanga  that  the  Government
       will ensure that rural development will be addressed  by  the  public
       sector in partnership with the private sector;


  (2) further notes that in her statement the Minister mentioned that seven
       projects with a collective budget of  over  R5,1  million  have  been
       implemented in Daggakraal, and that these include the construction of
       market stalls, a vegetable garden, a community hall, a taxi rank, two
       schools and a trading centre; and


  (3) therefore commends the Minister and the Government for  working  hard
       to improve the lives of all our people.
  [Applause.]

                     REVENUE LAWS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, this is the third tax  Bill  that  has
been put before this House this year  and  a  further  illustration  of  the
massive tax reforms that we have embarked  upon.  The  Revenue  Laws  Second
Amendment Bill includes  changes  to  some  190  clauses.  Because  all  hon
members here are so fresh  and  interested  in  tax  matters,  I  shall  now
proceed to read the changes to each of the  190  clauses.  Alternatively,  I
shall say: I move. That is what I opt to do. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Bill referred for  consideration  and  report  to  the  Joint  Committee  on
Revenue Laws Second Amendment Bill, 2001, established by resolution  of  the
House on 11 October 2001.

The House adjourned at 18:09.
