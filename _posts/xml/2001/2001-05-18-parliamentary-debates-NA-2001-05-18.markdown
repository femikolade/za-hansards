                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr J H NASH: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  candlelighting ceremonies will take place in South Africa and
           abroad in sympathy with people living with HIV/Aids, as well as
           those that have died as a result of this pandemic; and


       (b)  the vigil will raise awareness and mobilise communities in the
           fight against Aids;


  (2) believes that the fight against HIV/Aids is a challenge facing all
       South Africans and should not be politicised; and


  (3) calls on people to support and attend all events planned and to join
       the partnership in the fight against Aids.

[Applause.]

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Mr Chair, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with shock and disgust allegations that a child sex syndicate
           which involves 15 policemen and detectives has been uncovered in
           Johannesburg; and


       (b)  that the youngest child involved is 14 years old; and


  (2) calls on the Minister of Safety and Security as well as the Minister
       of Social Development to co-ordinate an investigation and to
       encourage victims to come forward so that the perpetrators can be
       exposed, arrested, tried and, if found guilty, punished for their
       offences.

Mr J H SLABBERT: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) appreciates the move by the Airports Company of South Africa (ACSA),
       in collaboration with the national Department of Agriculture's
       veterinary services, to halt the spread of foot-and-mouth disease by
       introducing foot baths at Johannesburg International Airport and the
       possibility of another such service at Cape Town International
       Airport;


  (2) believes that the move will secure the health of animals and people
       since possible carriers of such a disease will be disinfected on
       entry into or exit from the country by this facility; and


  (3) appeals to the public in general and passengers in particular to lend
       their co-operation to this noble cause.

  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the World Boxing Union champion, Cassius Baloyi, was shot in the
           thigh in a hijacking incident in which one motorist died; and


       (b)  his car was hijacked in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, in the same
           incident;


  (2) condemns this cowardly and criminal conduct; and


  (3) congratulates the police on the quick arrest of suspects in this
       case.

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -

       (a)  South Africa has the highest rate of child abuse in the world;
           and


       (b)  one in every three girls and one in every five boys in South
           Africa are abused;
  (2) further notes that these shocking statistics were pointed out by Mr
       Alwyn Nel, SA Post Office Philatelic Services senior manager, at the
       launch of a stamp highlighting the plight of children;


  (3) believes that it is tragic that so many children in South Africa are
       suffering; and


  (4) urges the Government -


       (a)  to impose the most severe punishment on anyone found guilty of
           committing a crime against a child; and


       (b)  to ensure that South Africa's children are brought up in a safe
           environment and that we provide them with the future they are
           entitled to.

Even if that member says it is nonsense, that is what the man said and it
is not nonsense. [Interjections.]

day of the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:

       of 80% for the past 15 years;

       who have built up this school on their own;

       area is below 20%; and


  (4) calls on the Northern Province government to give this school, and
       others under its jurisdiction, the necessary support and assistance
       in order for them to excel.

VhaVenda vha hashu! [Our Venda people!]
Prof S S RIPINGA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -

       (a)  South Africa is committed to the sociopolitical economic
           recovery of the African continent;


       (b)  democracy is an important component to articulate people's
           aspirations for the continent; and


       (c)  the practice of democracy not only excites thoughts and options,
           but also lends itself to and facilitates the intellectual growth
           and development of any society;


  (2) welcomes President Joseph Kabila's lifting of the four-year ban on
       free political activity; and


  (3) salutes all African leaders engaged in such efforts to restore the

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem daarvan dat die Minister van Onderwys, prof Kader Asmal,
       dit oorweeg om die magte van beheerliggame by skole verder in te perk
       deur -


       (a)  beheerliggame te dwing om personeel aan te stel wat demografies
           meer verteenwoordigend is;


       (b)  die besluit oor taalbeleid by skole nie meer aan beheerliggame
           oor te laat nie; en


       (c)  skole te verbied om skoolgelde in trustfondse in te betaal; en


  (2) 'n beroep doen op die Minister om nie die reeds beperkte magte wat
       deur die Suid-Afrikaanse Skolewet aan beheerliggame gegee word nog
       verder in te kort nie, maar dat hy eerder sal toesien dat
       beheerliggame voldoende magte kry om sodoende skole na behore te
       bestuur.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister of Education, Prof Kader Asmal, is
       contemplating further restricting the powers of controlling bodies at
       schools by -


       (a)  forcing controlling bodies to appoint more demographically
           representative staff;


       (b)  no longer entrusting the decision on language policy at schools
           to controlling bodies; and


       (c)  prohibiting schools from depositing school funds into trust
           accounts; and


  (2) appeals to the Minister not to curtail any further the already
       reduced powers granted to controlling bodies by the South African
       Schools Act, but rather to see to it that controlling bodies receive
       sufficient powers to be able to manage schools properly.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die AEB sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) met afkeur kennis neem van die barbaarse metodes wat by 'n sogenaamde
       Christelike sorgsentrum vir dwelm- en drankverslaafdes in Noupoort
       gebruik word om pasiënte te dissiplineer;


  (2) met skok kennis neem van die dood van die 16-jarige Logan Klingenberg
       van Pretoria, wat in die detensieselle van die inrigting dood
       aangetref is nadat hy met 'n ketting om sy nek aan tralies vasgemaak
       is op so 'n wyse dat hy nie kon sit of lê nie;


  (3) versoek dat 'n kommissie van ondersoek aangestel word om die situasie
       in die sentrum te ondersoek en dienooreenkomstig aanbevelings te
       maak;


  (4) sy vertroue uitspreek dat die persone verantwoordelik vir Logan se
       dood strafregtelik vervolg sal word;


  (5) dit ernstig betreur dat, terwyl die sentrum die naam ``Christelik''
       dra, dit van metodes gebruik maak wat indruis teen alles wat Christus
       gedoen en geleer het; en


  (6) sy meegevoel uitspreek teenoor die familie van Logan.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the AEB:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with disapproval the barbaric methods used to discipline
       patients at a so-called Christian care centre at Noupoort for persons
       addicted to drugs and alcohol;


  (2) notes with shock the death of 16-year-old Logan Klingenberg of
       Pretoria, who was found dead in the detention cells of the
       institution after he had been chained to the railings by his neck in
       such a manner that he could not sit or lie down;


  (3) requests that a commission of inquiry be appointed to investigate the
       situation at the centre and to make recommendations accordingly;


  (4) expresses its confidence that the persons responsible for Logan's
       death will face criminal prosecution;


  (5) seriously deplores the fact that, although the centre bears the name
       ``Christian'', it uses methods which are contrary to everything
       Christ did and taught; and


  (6) expresses its condolences to Logan's family.]

Mr R D PIETERSE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the statement by the Minister for the Public Service and
       Administration that the Government paid consultants a total of R1,6
       billion;


  (2) believes that this honest admission reflects the commitment of the
       ANC-led Government to transparency;


  (3) welcomes this acknowledgement; and


  (4) supports the commitment by the Government to address this problem.

[Applause.]

Mr N J CLELLAND: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with dissatisfaction that the ANC Government is spending almost
           R600 million on a luxury jet for the President at a time when
           the same Government is doing little to uplift the poor; and


       (b)  that the purchase price of the President's new luxury jet is R45
           million more than another luxury jet in the same class and will
           cost the taxpayer over R2 million more per year to run than the
           less expensive luxury jet; and


  (2) calls on the President to think first of the people he is elected to
       serve and ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has
expired. The rest of the motion will be printed in the Order Paper.

Mr K M ANDREW: Mr Chair, on a point of order, Sir: There is no way that
that was one minute. No way whatsoever.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, I go by the timepiece
that is in front of me. [Interjections.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Mr Chairman, there is something dreadfully wrong with the
clock that has been set ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, there is no need
to get excited. I will just take some advice as to the working of the
mechanism. The Chair can only go by the timepiece that is here.

It is agreed that there was a problem, and I think if it was brought to my
attention in a civil manner we would have dealt with it in a civil manner.
[Interjections.] There was no need to get excited. I simply go by what is
here.

Hon member, you will be allowed to proceed.

Mr K M ANDREW: Chairperson, on a point of order: Are you suggesting that
what I said was not said in a civil manner?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, you could have risen on a
point of order. You could have addressed me rather than showing annoyance
at the fact that I was merely doing what the timepiece required ...

Mr K M ANDREW: Mr Chairman, with due respect, Sir, I am doing my job as a
Whip, and I think I did it in a way that got the result we wanted. I do not
understand why you are angry about the way I did it.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Because, hon member, you would have
got the same result had you approached the Chair and indicated that there
was something wrong. [Interjections.] Hon member, you may proceed.

Mr N J CLELLAND:


       (b)  that the purchase price of the President's jet is R45 million
           more than another luxury jet in the same class, and will cost
           the taxpayer about R2 million more per year to run than the less
           expensive jet; and


  (2) calls on the President to think first of the people he is elected to
       serve and -


       (a)  spend less time overseas;


       (b)  make use of SA Airways for his travel needs; and


       (c)  reconsider this outrageously expensive luxury.

[Interjections.]

Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the ANC-led Government has taken steps to improve the
       security of judges and police officers involved in investigating and
       presiding in urban terror cases in the Western Cape;


  (2) acknowledges that this demonstrates the preparedness of the ANC
       Government to defend our democracy and our Constitution; and


  (3) welcomes the decision to improve security for judges and police
       officers investigating urban terror cases.

[Applause.]

Mnr F BEUKMAN: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) met ernstige kommer kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die migrasiekontrolestelsel wat in 1989 in werking gestel is,
           totaal verouderd en ontoereikend is;


       (b)  die stelsel, wat 'n werkleeftyd van slegs vyf jaar gehad het,
           reeds 12 jaar in werking is;


       (c)  die stelsel totaal ontoereikend is vir die regulering en
           monitering van migrasie en nie die volume data kan hanteer nie;
           en


       (d)  Suid-Afrika se integriteit van sy grensbeheerstelsel hierdeur
           gekompromiteer en onderhewig aan ernstige wanpraktyke kan wees;


  (2) sy ernstige skok uitspreek dat die R20 miljoen wat benodig word om
       die stelsel op te gradeer nie deur die Departement van Finansies aan
       Binnelandse Sake beskikbaar gestel is nie; en


    3) 'n beroep op Minister Trevor Manuel doen om dringend toe te sien dat
       die nodige stappe gedoen word om Suid-Afrikaanse migrasiebeheer
       voldoende te befonds ten einde dit effektief en werkbaar te maak.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr F BEUKMAN: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with serious concern that -


       (a)  the migration control system that was introduced in 1989 is
           totally outdated and inadequate;
       (b)  the system, which had a working life of only five years, has
           already been in operation for 12 years;


       (c)  the system is totally inadequate for the regulation and
           monitoring of migration and cannot handle the volume of data;
           and


       (d)  the integrity of South Africa's border control system can be
           compromised and subject to serious malpractices as a result of
           this;


  (2) expresses its great shock that the R20 million needed to upgrade the
       system has not been made available to the Department of Home Affairs
       by the Department of Finance; and


  (3) appeals to Minister Trevor Manuel urgently to see to it that the
       necessary steps are taken for the adequate funding of South Africa's
       migration control in order to make it effective and viable.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the criticism levelled at governments around the world by
           doctors at the World Congress of Family Doctors held in South
           Africa, when this congress lashed out at governments for their
           spendthrift nature with regard to the purchasing of arms and
           ammunition instead of providing health care; and


       (b)  the wide consensus present at the congress that the HIV/Aids
           epidemic is the most devastating epidemic in human history, yet
           governments are not doing enough;


  (2) expresses its concern with regard to a statement by Dr Wendy Orr, who
       stated that little has changed in the quality of health care in South
       African prisons since the days of the old South Africa;
  (3) supports Dr Orr's call on her colleagues to speak out when they see
       abuses of human rights or inequities in the allocation of health care
       ...

[Time expired.]

Dr A S NKOMO: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  on Wednesday, 16 May 2001, an Aids Candle was lit in Parliament
           as a symbol of continued concern for those living with HIV/Aids;
           and


       (b)  on Sunday, 20 May 2001, under the slogan ``One Voice, Many
           Faces, United for Life'', mass rallies have been organised by
           the Government alongside the whole world, under the banner of
           the International Day of Prayer, to highlight the plight of
           those infected with and affected by HIV/Aids and to remember
           those who have succumbed in this epidemic;


  (2) congratulates the Department of Health on its caring and sensitive
       attitude to those who have been affected by this dreadful epidemic;
       and


  (3) condemns the DP for their cruel and cynical motion on this subject on
       17 May 2001.

[Applause.]

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 27 - Labour:

The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Chairperson, here is a man called Douglas Gibson
displaying his ignorance. He does not know that this is the uniform that we
put on when we inspect all workplaces in this country, including his.
[Applause.]

Today the people of our country, black and white, young and old, can say
without equivocation and with great confidence that as a country and as a
nation, we are on course. While the positive signs we see in the tapestry
of our socioeconomic landscape do not suggest that we have already reached
our desired destination, only those who fail to see reality for what it is
would refuse to admit that we are, indeed, on course. Each step we have
taken in developing and implementing progressive policies, as we have done,
has brought us closer and closer to our destination.

We are on course in steering this country away from the rout of an economy
which was mismanaged and destined to collapse. We are on course in creating
an environment conducive to job creation. We are on course in promoting
high levels of productivity through skills development. We are on course in
combating unfair discrimination in the workplace. We are on course in
breaking the back of adversarial labour relations and in ensuring that
employers do not exploit vulnerable workers with impunity. We are on course
in taking decisive steps to tackle problems we face in the occupational
health and safety environment, for we we are determined to ensure that no
employer places profit ahead of human life.

We are on course. The path we have chosen is not paved with the glitter of
gold. But even as we feel our way through thorn-bearing bushes, climb sky-
scrapping hills and navigate crocodile-infested waters, we remain undaunted
by the complexity of our assignment and the length of the journey ahead,
because we know that we are on course. Since 1994 we have marched proudly
and tirelessly on this challenging path as we began to recraft policies and
legislation with a determination to deepen our democracy, grow our economy,
promote our international competitiveness, create employment opportunities,
promote skills development, equity, social justice, and eradicate poverty.

While acknowledging the impossibility of reversing within seven years the
intractable and stupendous mess the apartheid regime of the NP created over
several generations, we do, nevertheless, derive satisfaction from the fact
that the measures we have introduced in the labour market enable us to echo
the President's words during the state of the nation address when he said,
and I quote: ``Gradually, step by step, our country is moving away from its
painful past.'' In that regard hon members will no doubt agree that we are
on course.

We are on course in reducing adversarial labour relations and promoting
workplace peace and stability. Our own figures, as well as independently
collected statistics, tell us that the number of person days lost due to
strikes is gradually declining. In fact, last year, the number of person
days lost was at an all-time low. In addition, the vast majority of strikes
are procedural and there is very little violence associated with them.

There are a number of reasons for these exciting figures. One of them
relates to the fact that the changes which the 1995 Labour Relations Act
introduced, are beginning to bear fruit. Employers and employees have
become familiar with the new procedures and are using them more and more to
strengthen and consolidate collective bargaining. Strong, mature collective
bargaining means that disputes such as those relating to wages are more
likely to be settled through negotiations than having to resort to strike
action. The significance of this phenomenon is that it heralds a
dispensation in which the labour market has become more stable and less
unpredictable. This is an undeniable and resounding affirmation of our
approach to labour market policy.

The labour policy review process we undertook last year also confirms, in
no uncertain terms, that our policies are sound and in line with our vision
to maintain an elusive balance between labour market efficiency and decent
labour standards. Therefore the proposed amendments to the Labour Relations
Act and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act that I announced last year
are not aimed at overhauling labour market policies, but at improving the
application of the law and increasing sensitivity of our laws towards the
imperatives of job creation and, in the words of the President, `` ... to
address unintended consequences''.

As hon members may know, social partners are engaged in debating the draft
Bills at Nedlac and through other bilateral processes. The vitriolic
cacophony sparked by some of the controversial changes I proposed has now
evaporated without trace as social partners engage with each other and
begin to understand what the Government sought to achieve through these
amendments.

I have given sufficient time and space to social partners to debate the
proposals and, based on the feedback I have received, it looks as if this
country will, indeed, be graced by an unprecedented miracle. Whether one
believes it or not, it is coming. It is indeed unprecedented in this
country for organised business and labour to rise above their respective
immediate interests, as they have now demonstrated, to promote the
interests of the broader citizenry. I therefore would like to congratulate
organised business and labour for the broad agreement that these
constituencies are crafting. [Applause.] I can assure them that the
Government will take the proposed deal very seriously in finalising the
proposed Bills before they are tabled in Parliament.

But it is equally important for me to register my growing impatience and
concern at the slow pace that this process has assumed. While I understand
that quality time is necessary for quality deals, we cannot allow captains
of industry and workers' representatives to talk forever. We need to bring
finality and closure to this matter, and in this regard I expect a report
from Nedlac not later than June this year.

We are also on course in implementing skills development legislation passed
by this honourable House. In order to address the skills deficit which
continues to restrain the rate at which our economy grows, my department
has launched a national skills development strategy, whose objectives are:
the development of a culture of high quality, lifelong learning; fostering
skills development in the formal economy for productivity and employment
growth; stimulating and supporting skills development in small businesses;
promoting skills development for employability and sustainable livelihood
through social development initiatives; and assisting new entrants in
employment.

Each objective is linked to a set of measurable targets. The targets
include, for example, ensuring that 75% of large firms are claiming grants
and enjoying measurable benefits; and that 80 000 young people are in
learnerships by March 2005, and ensuring that at least 50% of those that
have completed learnerships are in some kind of employment or in further
study thereafter. Similar targets have been agreed to for each objective.

This strategy advances key aspects of the human resource development
spearheaded by my department and the Department of Education, and announced
by the President in this year's state of the nation address. I am confident
that with the energy of my team in the department, matched by the energy
and commitment of employers who are hungry for skilled staff and workers
who are hungry to learn, we will meet these targets. This is one of the key
interventions which will ensure that gradually, step by step, our country
moves away from its painful past.

I remain deeply saddened and devastated by the incident that occurred in a
Lenasia factory last year, where 11 workers died following the outbreak of
a fire. As hon members know, the owner of the factory and his manager are
facing serious criminal charges. Certain officials of the Department of
Labour, suspected of having acted with indiscretion and ineptitude, have
been suspended and charged. I trust that the outcome of these processes
will send a clear signal that the state will not tolerate conduct which
shows contempt for the lives of others.

Following the Lenasia incident, inspectors of my department flooded
industrial parks throughout the country to assess the extent of
noncompliance with workplace safety standards. Within a three-week period,
more than 500 factories were visited. We were horrified by the extent of
noncompliance in most small factories. In some instances, employers and
workers alike were ignorant of the safety regulations. In other instances,
it was found that employers knowingly and dismissively disregarded safety
regulations, taking advantage of the relative vulnerability of workers.

Our revised enforcement strategy is now informed by these findings which we
cannot afford to ignore. To this end, we have launched an awareness
campaign in collaboration with the three main labour federations, supported
by Business South Africa. This campaign has resulted in the establishment
of safety and health committees in order to monitor compliance in the
various workplaces. We have intensified blitz inspections to improve
visibility of labour inspectors in factories. We have also decided to be
more targeted and to focus on areas identified as hot spots. All these
strategies are aimed at ensuring that we provide the highest possible
standards of protection for workers.

I would like to pause for a moment and pay well-deserved tribute to
inspectors of my department for their commitment and dedicated service
under very difficult and trying circumstances. Some of them from the
Western Cape are up in the gallery today. [Applause.] That is why I am
wearing this hat and this jacket today.
Ek is nou 'n inspekteur. [Tussenwerpsels.] Daardie lid moet oppas, want ek
is nou 'n inspekteur. [Gelag.] [I am now an inspector. [Interjections.]
That member should watch out, because I am now an inspector. Laughter.]]

Sometimes these inspectors have had dogs set on them by bellicose farmers,
and some have suffered verbal and physical abuse at the hands of
belligerent employers.

Ek wil graag aan my toegewyde inspekteurs sê dat hulle nie moed moet opgee,
wanneer hulle as gevolg van hul deeglike werk beledig of vervolg word nie.
[I would like to say to my dedicated inspectors that they should not get
discouraged when they, because of their sterling work, are insulted or
persecuted.]

Kumlisela namaqobokazana, angamajoni angamadindala nabalindi beli Sebe
leZabasebenzi, afunzwa ngezinja, atyatyekwa ngezithuko, atyityinjiselwa
iminwe, axhatshazwayo, atshicelwayo ngenxa yokuba esenza umsebenzi wawo
ngondiliseko nangomonde, ndifuna ukuthi kuwo: Makaqine esazi nje ukuba
umsebenzi wawo  awulambathi eNkosini. Ndifuna ukuthi lo uphetheyo
uRhulumente ungecala lawo. Uzimisele ukujongana neemfuno zawo ukuwenza lula
umsebenzi wawo omkhulu kangaka. Makayazi into yokuba sinqumla intlango
enookrebe, enezandawana namaxhwili. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph
follows.)

[To the young men and women, who are soldiers who serve as the guards and
warders of the Department of Labour, on whom dogs are set, at whom insults
are levelled and fingers are pointed, who are abused and spat on, because
they do their job diligently and in a dignified manner, I would also like
to say: They should be strong for their labour is not in vain in the eyes
of the Lord. I would like to tell them that this Government is on their
side. It is committed to catering for their needs so as to ease their
enormous task. They should know that we are crossing a desert that is
filled with daunting challenges.]

When it comes to the issue of the safety of workers, a zero tolerance
approach can be expected from my department. The problem of racism and
sexism in our country did not evaporate with the adoption of what is
deservedly referred to as one of the most progressive constitutions in the
modern world. Black people, women and people with disabilities continue to
suffer the indignity of being marginalised and being discriminated against
in the workplace. It is not by an accident of history that the majority of
unemployed people are black. This is as a result of many years of social
engineering by the NP racist regime. It has left us with a legacy we cannot
think away or sweep under the carpet. This cannot be removed within seven
years.

A number of interventions are required for us to move this country away
from its painful past. It was in recognition of this accomplishment that
this honourable House passed the Employment Equity Act, which my department
administers. Empowered by this Act, my department has rolled out a number
of initiatives aimed at ensuring that those who hail from designated groups
are given the chance and the opportunity they rightfully deserve.

In October last year we released the first employment equity report based
on reports from companies who employ over 150 employees. We plan to
release, within a couple of months, a more comprehensive report on all
employers who have reported. Despite what our detractors have said about
our not having capacity, we were able to receive, capture and analyse all
the reports sent in. The problems seemed much greater from the employers'
side. Despite the 18-month breathing period from the time the law was
passed until the date when reports were due, about one third of companies
still wanted extensions.

The results released so far speak volumes. Black people only make up 27% of
senior managers, including legislators. This means that employers continue
to discriminate against professionals from the designated groups. This is
unacceptable in a country that suffers from an acute skills deficiency.
However, there are some companies which have made significant headway and
are beginning to reap the benefits of doing so. The challenge in the next
period for the department is to provide more support for employers and
workers who are trying to achieve this goal, and to take action against
those who show no will to comply.

One area of support that we are working on is the development of a number
of guidelines and codes of good practice to ensure the proper
implementation of the Employment Equity Act. On 1 December last year, I
promulgated a code of good practice on key aspects of HIV/Aids and
employment. This code covers a range of topical and important issues,
including HIV testing, confidentiality, disclosure, discrimination,
counselling and support, ensuring a safe working environment and workplace
programmes. So brilliant and comprehensive is our code that even the
International Labour Organisation has decided to use it as the basis for
developing a code that will enjoy international status.

On 20 April I released, for public comment, a draft code of practice on key
aspects of disability in the workplace. This code is intended to be a guide
on how to employ, retrain and value people with disabilities in a working
environment. So, while admitting that we are not yet there, we can
nevertheless confirm that we are on course.

The department remains committed to the protection of vulnerable workers
through the implementation of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act. To
this end, we published last year a sectoral determination for security
workers. The process of finalising a follow-up sectoral determination is at
an advanced stage. I am encouraged by the way that employers and employees
are co-operating in resolving this matter.

As required by law, I will wait for the Employment Conditions Commission to
submit its report and recommendations on this matter before I promulgate a
sectoral determination. In the meantime, the parties are bound by what I
determined last year. Given that the security industry employs workers who
are amongst the most exploited in South Africa, we have also set up for the
first time, in terms of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, a security
workers provident fund in order to improve their conditions and benefits
structure. These measures will constitute a giant milestone in moving
workers in the security industry step by step away from their painful past.

High on our agenda this year is the setting of minimum wages and conditions
of work for farm and domestic workers. During the next few weeks I will be
releasing for public comment two detailed reports on the conditions of work
of farm and domestic workers and on our proposals in respect of wages and
conditions of work. We have already had public hearings throughout the
country and have asked the public for comments, but, in order to ensure
that all views are heard and all concerns are taken into account, we are
giving employers and workers a further opportunity to express their views
and influence the outcome. The Employment Conditions Commission will
consider all these views and advise me so that these determinations may be
finalised.

The promulgation of a sectoral determination and a code of good practice
for workers on job creation schemes can also be expected shortly. The
sectoral determination has already been finalised and I am awaiting
feedback from Nedlac in respect of the code of good practice. This
initiative will undoubtedly create an environment for more jobs to be
created. When more jobs are created, more people will be able to put food
on the table, more parents will be able to send their children to school,
and the vicious cycle of poverty, ignorance and disease will be broken as
this country accelerates its pace further and further away from its painful
past.

I recently tabled in this Parliament the new Unemployment Insurance Bill.
When this Bill is passed as law and implemented, it will be implemented
with a new information technology system which my department has developed
in anticipation of these legislative changes. This system records each and
every employer that contributes to the fund, allows for electronic
payments, establishes the eligibility of a claim electronically and enables
clients to receive their benefits electronically.

When the proposed Bill is passed into law by this House, it is expected
that it will reduce incidents of noncompliance by employers, reduce the
vulnerability of the fund from being defrauded, bring to an end the
structural deficit of the fund and stop the arbitrary and unfair denial of
unemployment insurance benefits to domestic workers, thus contributing to
the creation of an effective social security system. These are the types of
initiatives that make us say unashamedly that, indeed, we are on course in
steering this country away from its painful past.

The year 2001 also marks a significant strategic shift for the Department
of Labour, a shift away from policy formulation to a focus on
implementation of legislation. It was in contemplation of this shift that
the department was restructured into business units charged with delivery
of services at provincial offices and labour centres. The structure of our
budget reflects this shift. In order to effectively pursue this new
direction, we have created a new programme called Service Delivery. The
Minister of Finance will be delighted to know that we are not asking for
more money to implement this programme. Instead we will decentralise
resources from head office to labour centres where officials of the
department will interface directly with our clients.

The integrated inspection and enforcement task team has now developed a
comprehensive enforcement strategy to be rolled out this year. While the
strategy seeks to promote voluntary compliance, it also takes a hard-line
approach towards habitual noncompliance. Informed by this strategy,
inspectors have begun inundating workplaces and demanding compliance with
labour legislation.

Nothing vindicates our integrated approach to inspection better than the
workplace accident statistics. Since the implementation of the integrated
inspection system there has been a 17,3% decrease in workplace accidents.
The capacity of the department to provide proactive inspection and to
speedily investigate accidents has been tremendously enhanced.

Despite this phenomenal decrease in the number of accidents, I remain
concerned that there are people who will still go to work to die. As far as
I am concerned, a single death is one death too many. That is why the
integrated inspection and enforcement strategy focuses on prevention and
seeks to promote collaboration with workers and employers, without which
our efforts aimed at preventing workplace accidents and deaths are sure to
fail.

In line with Government's zero tolerance of corruption, my department
during this financial year has dismissed all officials found guilty of
fraud and corruption. As many of the members may know and may have heard
from the news this morning, a swift and decisive move by my department has
resulted in the arrest of two senior officials of the Forestry Sectoral
Education and Training Authority by the Scorpions. Assets allegedly
obtained from stolen money were impounded by the Asset Forfeiture Unit.
This is the kind of intervention corrupt officials can expect from my
department. I congratulate the Scorpions on their timely action and trust
that the law will take its course. [Applause.]

In line with Batho Pele, my department recently adopted a service charter
that commits officials of the department to a high standard of service
delivery, characterised by courtesy towards clients, efficiency and
professionalism in service delivery. It is by these standards that we must
be judged, not because we lay any claims to infallibility or perfection. We
have adopted this charter with all the humility that we can muster, simply
because we are committed to serving those who face the trap of being
injured or killed at work.

We have adopted this charter so that it can guide us as we seek to serve
those whose dignity and self-esteem have been eroded by the pain of
joblessness; those whose potential to ascend the corporate ladder has been
constrained and frustrated by lack of skills; those who have been prevented
from pursuing careers of choice because of colour, gender or physical
disability; and those who are systematically denied decent labour
standards. Those are the people for whom we exist. Those are the people we
dare not fail. While we have not yet reached our destination, we can see
with a clear eye that we are getting closer and closer, and that is why we
can say, with an honest voice, that we are on course.

Allow me to conclude by thanking persons and institutions that have
contributed to our successes during the previous financial year. First of
all I would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to my learned Director-
General, Adv Rams Ramashia, for his unqualified support, outstanding
performance and unparalleled commitment to the vision of the Department of
Labour. [Applause.] I would also like to thank my overworked team of senior
managers, many of whom are present in the public gallery today. I would
also like to thank the foot soldiers of the department in provincial
offices and labour centres for their commitment and hard work, as well as
social partners for their much-needed support and all statutory
institutions that complement the work of the department.

I would be failing in my duty if I did not acknowledge the stunning work
done by the Portfolio Committee on Labour in effectively carrying out their
oversight role under the leadership of Comrade Salie Manie. Their
contribution in this regard has also helped in ensuring that we remain on
course. [Applause.]

Ms E THABETHE: Chairperson, there has not been a coup. The chairperson fell
ill on Tuesday and he is off sick.

The DEPUTY CHAIPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, the speaker is
soft-spoken, and if you are also going to be speaking at the same time, no
one will be able to hear her. [Interjections.] Order! Yes, I understand,
but it is important that the hon member is heard. Proceed, hon member.

Ms E THABETHE: Chaiperson, the theme ``a nation at work'', one of the prime
objectives ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I have allowed
you to carry on with your conversations in an undertone, but when the Chair
appeals to you to be silent in order that the business of the House can
flow, please take heed. When it is possible, the Chair does allow you a lot
of latitude. So when I am calling on you to be silent, please co-operate
with me.

Ms E THABETHE: Chairperson, it is no surprise; they are always like this.
[Interjections.] This is one of the prime objectives of the ANC Government
... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I want the
business of this House to proceed, and I do not want us to be sidetracked
by other issues. Please, now, if you could allow the debate to proceed.
[Interjections.] Order! I am not going to tolerate this from both sides! I
want the hon member to be able to make a contribution. If she cannot be
heard, it would be quite pointless. So, hon member, you may proceed. I
request hon members please to co-operate for the duration of the hon
member's speech. [Interjection.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, on a point of order: Are you ruling that this
hon member is entitled to be listened to in absolute silence and that
nobody may say anything during her speech? Is that what you are ruling? If
that is the case, could I perhaps just get clarity and establish why she is
accorded this particular consideration when other people are not listened
to at all and get shouted down? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, this is a point
of order, and the hon Gibson is perfectly entitled to rise on a point of
order and I would like to hear him. Proceed, hon member.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Perhaps the Chairperson would like to answer my question?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, I will. Hon members, the Chair
exercises its discretion. And so long as it was possible for a member to be
heard, the Chair has permitted, since this morning, quite a number of
members to undertake their discussions in undertones. But if members take
the podium and do not have the voice to be able to be heard, I think the
Chair is entitled to ask hon members to co-operate.

The Chair is not saying that this member is the only one who will be so
privileged. If another member who comes from another side were also to have
the same impediment, the Chair would attempt to protect that member. I
think that the House will accord the Chair the right to attempt to
influence the way in which the debate is going, moment by moment. Right
now, if the speaker at the podium can speak and raise her voice, well, I
think we will be in a position to allow hon members to continue with their
conversations in undertones, but if not, please let us allow business to
proceed.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, arising from your ruling, may I request you
to consider two things: firstly, to do something about the sound system so
that the person can be heard, after all that is what the sound system is
for and, secondly, to please rule that the person who is speaking may not
attempt to engage the opposition or anybody else and that the ruling which
you have given about our sitting in absolute silence will be cancelled if
she tries to engage the opposition. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I think it is
fair that if someone needs consideration, they also need to play by the
same rules, so I would like to allow that to happen. As far as the sound
system is concerned, I do know that the matter is under review.

Mr N J GOGOTYA: Chairperson, on a point of order: I think it is unfortunate
for the hon member to imply that the Chair has given a ruling that says
that there must be absolute silence. The Chairperson used the term
``undertones'', and there is quiet a grammatical difference between the
two, and I think the hon member ... [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, basically I am asking the hon
members please to try and co-operate with the Chair, and let us not put too
fine a point on that. The hon member may proceed.

Ms E THABETHE: Chairperson, I repeat, the theme ``a nation at work'' is one
of the prime objectives of the ANC Government. The budget before us today
furthers this objective. Six years ago we inherited a world of work based
on economic deprivation, adversarial labour relations and blatant denial of
worker rights; run on a cheap and migrant labour system, massive income and
wealth disparities, systematic exploitation and discrimination against poor
people, women, youth, people with disabilities and other groups, and high
unemployment levels.

This terrible and unacceptable inhumane legacy did not vanish into thin air
when the ANC took over the reins of Government. Hon Tony Leon will always
remind the members of the past. [Interjections.] We are not going to be
lectured by the DP as to what happened. I expect a leader of the opposition
to behave like one, not like a youth league member. [Interjections.]

Even today this legacy continues to weigh heavily on the working lives of
our people and on the business environment. Despite the distorted labour
market framework that we inherited, the ANC-led Government has been
successful in delivering on our promise of a new labour dispensation that
entrenches not only the rights denied for so many decades, but also lays
the foundation for sustainable and sound economic growth.

This approach to labour market policy has been informed by the overall
programme of the first democratic Government and the recommendations of the
comprehensive labour market commission appointed by the President in 1999.
This has provided the basis for legislation such as passed by Parliament
between 1994 and 1999, legislation such the Basic Conditions of Employment
Act, the Labour Relations Act, the Skills Development Act and so on, which
today provide the foundation of our labour policy.

Indeed, when the ANC preaches a better life for all, it also includes
better working conditions for workers of this country and job creation
measures for the unemployed masses, which this budget seeks to implement.
Indeed, industrial relations have never been so good. We have seen the
publication of certificates of accreditation for 21 bargaining councils. We
have seen nearly 17 000 disputes referred to bargaining councils. The
department has monitored collective bargaining trends and overseen the CCMA
as a supporting implementation institution.

The launch of a code of good practice on key aspects of disability in the
workplace is a significant step in promoting the rights of the most
marginalised of our community. I know that the opposition will never ever
be grateful or humbly acknowledge this progressive budget, even if it is to
the advantage of the people they claim to represent, claims they made so
loudly when they campaign for elections, but which they forget when it
comes to supporting the progressive laws that we pass in this House.
[Interjections.]

Sesotho paragraphs follows.)

[Comrades, do not listen to these people who do not know where they are
going. We, the ANC, know very well where we are coming from and where we
are going to. They should not confuse you because you will then follow
them, even though they do not know where they are going.

They have been defeated, throughout the years, by the task of rectifying
matters for the workers of this country. They are still unable to do so,
even today. However, the ANC knows very well what the complaints of the
workers are, and it attends to them freely, because there are no longer any
abused workers, like they used to practise abuse when they were in power.
They do not want the truth. That is why, even today, we hear about the bad
things that happened at Seta, and the Department of Labour decided to tell
the police that there are some bad things that are happening. I wonder what
they would have done, if they were in that position.]

I repeat, relations have never been as good as they are under the ANC-led
Government. [Interjections.] The Minister has pointed out how the changes
introduced by the Labour Relations Act of 1995 are beginning to bear fruit.
The Department of Labour's approach to labour market policy entails the
following good points: regulation of the labour market in order to resolve
inherited rigidities and inflexibility; promotion of labour market and
overall economic efficiency; employment creation; promotion of worker
security and safety through the maintenance of socially acceptable and
mandated minimum conditions and standards of employment, which are in line
with the constitutional requirements; promotion of participatory co-
operative labour market relations in the context of an institutionalised
and regulated framework; and promotion of equity and skills development in
the labour market.

Surely, we are fully behind Comrade Minister and his department in their
efforts to further realise those aspects that are not easily tackled. On
the other hand, the advocates of deregulation and labour market flexibility
understate the inherited rigidities and inequalities that are built into
the market. They are not sensitive to the poor conditions of work of many
sectors in which disadvantaged employees work, farm work security and
domestic work being an example. They underestimate the social and private
costs of a highly deregulated workforce in specific circumstances in South
Africa.

The Minister has said that the proposed amendments to the Labour Relations
Act and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act are not aimed at overhauling
labour market policies, as many members of the opposition parties seem to
think seeing how vocal they are about the legislation, as if they are the
champions of the working class, whereas they failed dismally during their
time. The opposition should not think that they can foster tensions within
the ANC-led alliance. Who are they, anyway, to start doing that? Their
``deurmekaar'' [mixed-up] alliance is falling apart now. They should be
ashamed of that because from the outset it was not formed on clear
principles and policies. It was just a ``deurmekaar'' alliance, hence it is
falling apart. [Interjections.]

That business and labour are now working together to reach agreement on the
proposed changes is the hallmark of our democracy, an example that our
official opposition would do well to follow. [Interjections.] The
opposition will never ever be able to change the position of the ANC, even
if they would like to, because they do not have the power and the energy.

Job creation is at the forefront for every one of us who is committed to
improving the lives of our people. We are confident because the department
has launched the national skills development strategy. The ANC knows that
too many of our people are hungry. We need not lecture on that. We also
know that building our economy is a task for all sectors, and that we
cannot simply rely on the department, or even Government as a whole, to
create jobs alone. This department has a major role to play, and the skills
development strategy, with its measurable targets, is a significant step
towards building a skilled, competitive and profitable workplace.

Our country faces many challenges. As we complete one step we are faced
with another challenge. HIV/Aids is a critical challenge. The department
has grasped this challenge with the promulgation of the code of good
practice. [Interjections.] As parliamentarians we have a role to play in
ensuring that message is taken from this Parliament into our communities,
into the workplace and into our constituencies.

We do not need to be lectured by the hon Leon on what HIV/Aids is and what
is causing it now. He is not really keen to listen to other people's views,
so he must just shut up. [Interjections.] Taking note of the hon Ruth
Bhengu's appeal for us all to engage in tackling this task, it is
gratifying that the most disempowered of our farm and domestic workers will
be receiving the attention of the Department of Labour.

Last year saw the ANC Government launch the Millennium Labour Council. We
hope that the culture of social and meaningful dialogue will be
strengthened, based on a strong foundation, and will reach the experience
of Nedlac. Business and labour leaders identified two critical matters
facing the country, when agreeing to set up the Millennium Labour Council,
namely unemployment, job losses and lack of job creation, which constitute
a deepening crisis requiring urgent attention. Current levels of poverty
and inequality are unacceptable and require new initiatives, to promote
improved quality of life and decent work for all.

In his opening address at the launch of the Council, the hon President
quoted Franklin Roosevelt, who said in 1937:


  I see a great nation, upon a great continent, blessed with a great wealth
  of natural resources. Its people are at peace among themselves; they are
  making their country a good neighbour among the nations. I see a United
  States which can demonstrate that, under democratic methods of
  government, national wealth can be translated into a spreading volume of
  human comforts, hitherto unknown, and the lowest standard of living can
  be raised far above the level of mere subsistence ...


  But here is the challenge to our democracy: In this nation, I see tens of
  millions - a substantial part of its whole population - who at this very
  moment are denied the greater part of ... the necessities of life. I see
  millions of families trying to live on incomes so meagre that the pall of
  family disaster hangs over them day by day. I see millions whose daily
  lives in city and on farm continue under conditions labelled indecent by
  so-called polite society half a century ago. I see millions denied
  education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the
  lot of their children. I see millions lacking the means to buy the
  products of farm and factory and by their poverty denying work and
  productiveness to many other millions. I see one third of a nation ill-
  housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.


  It is not in despair that I paint you that picture. I paint it for you in
  hope - because the nation, seeing and understanding the injustice in it,
  proposes to paint it out. We are determined to make every American
  citizen the subject of his country's interest and concern; and we will
  never regard any faithful law-abiding group within our borders as
  superfluous. The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the
  abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for
  those who have too little.

Let us pay heed to these words. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, before I call you
... Order! Hon Mr Gibson, I would like to invite you, either now or at any
suitable juncture when I am again in the Chair, to address the question of
private conversations. This is because I think we need to have an
understanding on the side of the presiding officers as to the level of
private conversations that may be permissible. You will recall that the
speaker, on the occasion of closing Parliament just before the recess
appealed to the House in this matter. I think you would be assisting the
House and the presiding officers if, when you are ready, you would take the
opportunity to address the issue. Thank you.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Mr Chairperson, I thank you very much for the invitation.
Obviously, I have not had an opportunity to consider the matter carefully.
However, I think that it is entirely appropriate for the Chair to intervene
when there is so much noise in the House that the person speaking cannot be
heard. Perhaps that is what the Chair attempted to do. With regard to the
person who has just addressed the House, her voice strengthened remarkably
after that, and I was tempted to stand up and suggest that you reverse your
ruling because she was more than capable of being heard by all of us above
the hubbub. [Interjections.]

But, on a more serious note, I think, with great respect, that the Chair
should avoid interfering unnecessarily which, in fact, creates more
disturbance than the members do. [Interjections.] I do not say that as a
reflection on the Chair at all. I think Parliament is not a place where we
sit dead quiet. And sometimes the quality of the speaker determines whether
persons sitting here want to listen or not. They must be able to engage the
ear of the House. But it is appropriate that if people are being shouted
down they should be protected, and I would go along with that.

The next speaker who is coming to the podium has a very quiet little voice
as well. So and I am hoping that you will give him similar protection.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON COMMITTEES: Order! Yes, the Chair has to be totally
impartial. The Chair, as you are aware, is the creature of this House and
whatever the Chair does is by leave of this House.

What I would like to suggest is that perhaps these matters need to be taken
up at the Rules Committee in order that there is greater clarity. And I do
take the point that the Chair also is not above being corrected, and the
Chair would appreciate healthy criticism in order that we can get the
correct balance.

Mr N J CLELLAND: Mr Chairperson, Mr Mdladlana has been in labour for 34
months, but he still has not delivered. [Interjections.]

Many people seem to believe that governments create jobs and that the
Minister should create jobs. This is not true. Frankly, governments cannot
and should not try to create jobs. So why then has the hon the Minister
failed? Let us be perfectly clear about this. The Ministry of Labour has
not created the environment that encourages the maximum possible
investment, entrepreneurship and job creation. Indeed, it would be safe to
assume that Government in general, and the Department of Labour in
particular, are closing down businesses, throttling the economy, deterring
investment and throwing thousands of people onto the scrapheap of
unemployment.

Let us examine why. It is an indisputable fact that unless we are able to
achieve 5% to 6% growth per year sustained over a long period, we are not
going to be able to reduce the backlog of unemployment and poverty in South
Africa. But in his Budget Speech earlier this year, Minister Manuel
announced, and I quote:


  Over the next three years, we expect growth to average 3,5% a year ...

The implications of this are disastrous, and the reasons are self-evident.
[Interjections.]

One of the most important impediments to growth, and therefore job
creation, is the current low investor confidence levels which, generally
speaking, are not due to dissatisfaction with South Africa's macroeconomic
position, but other social and political areas in which the Government can
play a role. These are areas like taxation, the quality of infrastructure,
crime and the inflexible labour regime. [Interjections.]

Investors, local and foreign, do not feel secure enough to make long-term
investments in South Africa. It is a fact. What if they invest heavily in
new machines, and further changes to the labour regime make it too
expensive to employ operators to run them? It is an indisputable fact that
the new labour laws have radically changed companies' cost structures,
resulting in even more scrapped capital. Business managers are not sure
that the country provides the best place in which to commit their capital
and themselves over the long term.

The American Chambers of Commerce in South Africa reported that foreign
investors regarded South Africa's labour legislation as entrenching an
inefficient labour force, resulting in high costs. The US Cotton Board
cites low productivity and union enforced wage rates as limiting South
Africa's ability to benefit from the USA Africa Growth and Opportunity
Act's apparel preferences. Cape Town's BMD Textiles says that onerous
labour laws are to blame for their massive retrenchments. South Africa's
largest blanket manufacturer, Waverley Blankets, have relocated to Botswana
due to high labour costs. Incidentally, in Botswana incentives include the
repayment of roughly 80% of labour costs for the first three years.

Tiger Wheels is the fifth biggest aluminium wheel manufacturer in the
world. They make wheels here, in Germany and in Poland. But in Poland,
where the wage rate is about the same as in South Africa, the average
employee is far better educated. In Poland, one third of employees' wages
are performance related. In Poland, Tiger Wheels is profitable. In South
Africa, their home base, they are running at a loss.

All levels of workers at Tiger Wheels SA, from top management all the way
down, except at the union level, said they were prepared to forego any
increase, because of the economic situation. The union, of course, went on
strike, and the arbitrator ruled that they were entitled to a wage
increase, because the rest of the industry was getting a wage increase.
Where does the Minister think Tiger Wheels will make their next investment?

Example after example, time after time, shows the nagging concern of every
South African investor and businessperson. Our inflexible labour market
increases costs, and increases hassles. It is a massive disadvantage by
international developing economy standards. Business needs the Government
to provide a stable environment. Business is looking to the hon the
Minister to provide a stable environment. What has the Minister delivered?
A set of insubstantial labour reforms that will keep South Africa at the
back of the global race for economic opportunities. [Interjections.]

The iron law of employment is this: The harder it is to fire a worker, the
less likely it is he will be hired; the more job protection there is, the
fewer jobs there are. Millions of our people are jobless and hungry and are
willing to work for low wages, and with little security, in order to put
food on their families' plates. But the labour laws will not allow them to
do so. We have many potential small businesspeople who would like to start
small companies, but they cannot afford the money and the high wages, and
the time and endless bureaucracy of our new labour laws.

Businesspeople need to spend their time and their hours in a factory making
goods, not sitting in a labour court listening to endless legal arguments.
Small businesspeople have neither the will nor the resources to fill in all
the forms required, let alone do all the exhaustive personnel searches and
extensive in-house training required by a zealous affirmative action
programme. [Interjections.] In a letter to the Business Day, ``Fed-up
Employer Lonehill'' has the following to say:


  My husband and I started our business 10 years ago and today employ about
  80 people. We were full of enthusiasm and employed only unemployed people
  where possible, training them on the job. Sure, they may have started on
  a low salary, but if they were hard-working and willing, they were soon
  rewarded; if not, they were out.


  Today I hate coming to work. All we want to do is sell our business and
  start something that does not require labour. We fall under a bargaining
  council, so wages, increases, hours, etc, are dictated to us and non-
  negotiable.


  I spend much time on disciplinary action paperwork and stressing to
  managers that paperwork must be done. As I am not an HR person, we had to
  join a labour group whom we pay to chair our disciplinary hearings and
  help us implement and stay within the new legislation.


  Staff, generally, are aware of their rights ... and are convinced that
  they can no longer be fired. Were it not so difficult to get rid of
  staff, we would certainly employ more. Instead, we view employment of
  staff as an evil to be avoided at all costs ...

The Minister should make it easier for an entrepreneur to start his or her
own business and employ others. One avenue would be permitting customised
contracts, negotiated in the presence of an official of the Department of
Labour, which would waive the onerous requirements of existing labour
legislation such as the Labour Relations Act. This would encourage
employment and provide an income for someone who would otherwise be out of
a job.

When a potential employee and a potential employer are willing to sign a
voluntary contract of employment between themselves, it is immoral for a
third party, such as the Government, which is supported by the trade union
aristocracy, to stop them from doing so. But this is exactly what the
labour laws do. [Interjections.]

In the successful modern economies such as Japan and the USA, there are a
multitude of small businesses, sometimes little more than a family working
in a garage supplying small industries. There is huge scope for this here
in South Africa. An entrepreneur with half a dozen workers can easily set
up a little factory, and they can be successful, as long as they work
effectively and on time.

It is in small enterprises like these that our best hopes for making our
economy grow and providing jobs lie. [Interjections.] But the little
businessman cannot run with shackles around his feet, and at the moment the
labour laws are shackling him. The economy must be free from unnecessary
regulations. Entrepreneurs and businesswomen and businessmen must be given
room to get on with the job of creating wealth and employment, and
expanding the tax base.

The hon Minister of Labour should take heed of these ominous trends and the
effects they are having on the everyday lives of our people. He should show
the political courage and will to deliver an environment that will provide
jobs for our people. [Applause.]

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Chairperson and colleagues, we in the IFP are very
conscious of the challenges facing the Department of Labour. Hence we
agreed with the director-general of this department when he said in his
yearly report that the department had committed mistakes. We all make
mistakes.

The department made mistakes during the year as it undertook innovations
aimed at ensuring that we deliver our services in the best way and at the
least cost possible. Challenges facing the department and the Ministry of
Labour are enormous. All of them are topical considering that they are
challenges of restructuring, downsizing, rationalisation and service
delivery. The aim of the department, that of playing a significant role in
reducing unemployment and alleviating poverty, makes these challenges even
bigger if it has to satisfy the labour movement. Joblessness will always be
with us if these challenges are not dealt with decisively.

The department will find a further dilemma in calming the agitated
workforce and delivering on its expected role of defending the cause of
Government and the workers' rights and benefits. The visionary outlook that
led to the contemplated future forums aimed at engaging the employers and
workers to secure the future of their industry is a step in the right
direction. The visionary attempts to mitigate the impact of retrenchments,
where that is inevitable, enjoy the IFP's full support.

In the same breath, we would like to see restructuring for the sake of our
economic future. We have the workers as our constituency across political
parties. Their interests are our interests. Their future is our future as
well. Such interests, however, will be meaningless if the safety and
occupational health of workers are not compatible with what we as public
representatives do to safeguard them. I am referring here to the issue of
injuries and death in the workplace.

We commend the Ministry for having increased the budget allocation in the
medium term, from R79,6 million to R104,3 million to strengthen the
workplace inspection campaign. I am glad that inspectors are here, as we
have been told, and I hope that they will do their job.

Workers have been injured and killed while on duty. This trend should and
could never be tolerated in a democratic country. The department should
vigorously push forward with the inspection campaign and demand an
acknowledgement from employers that investing in human resources through
proper training and promotion is the main key to productivity. Employers
must be made aware that workers are not just objects for getting returns on
their investment at all costs, but that their health and safety are just as
important as getting returns on them.

We welcome the enhancing of the administration and the placing of
occupational safety and health in the workplace and in the mining industry
under one Ministry of Labour rather than a fragmented approach which puts
this function under different departments, as used to be the case. In this
regard, injuries and death on duty will be compensated promptly and
expeditiously. The outsourcing of specialised investigations or inspections
will eliminate bias and improper evaluation of problems.

I want to say to the Minister that we are also concerned about the issue of
the skills shortage in this country. We therefore welcome the introduction
of the skills levy on employers in order to ensure the availability of
skills in the workplace. In that regard, we would like to see proper
inspections and closer monitoring of whether employers are actually
developing the skills of their employees.

Skills courses should be qualitative rather than quantitative so as to
ensure that the skilled workforce does not diminish but grows. Qualitative
training courses would ensure that the skilled workforce does not diminish
but grows. Such training would assure workers, even in the face of
inevitable retrenchments, that they can engage in self-employment
activities after retrenchment.

In the long term, this will lead to the decline in the recruitment of an
external workforce. That, of course, will depend on the prompt execution of
the guidelines that the Department of Labour has set itself vis-à-vis the
skills development programme. We would further like to see closer
collaboration between the Departments of Education, of Arts, Culture,
Science and Technology and of Labour.

Also, hand in hand with economic wellbeing comes industrial peace in this
country. Businesspeople have to accept the fact that trade unions are here
to stay. It is therefore imperative that good labour relations are
developed and the principle of tripartism is upheld at all times.
Government, business and trade unions have an equal share in the economy.
It would be a grave mistake to try and dissipate the power of established
trade unions in the country in one way or another.

The creation of political stability and economic stability should
strengthen one another. Only then will our people, especially workers,
actually see upward social mobility at the workplace, which will in turn
enhance the quality of life and revive the economy in our country. Only
then will previously disadvantaged people begin to enjoy the prize of our
new democracy, for which they have waited and fought for the best part of
their lives.

We believe, also, that the vigour shown by the department and the Ministry
will bear the fruits that will benefit the country in general, and workers
in particular. With these words, the IFP supports the Vote.

Sithi: Phambili nomzabalazo wabasebenzi! Phambili! [We say: Forward with
the workers' struggle! Forward!]

Hon MEMBERS: Phambili! [Ihlombe.] [Forward! [Applause.]]

Mr R M MOROPA: Chairperson, I just want to start off by saying to the
Minister that we should not listen to what the hon Clelland said, because
it is not going to help this department at all. Instead, what he said was a
demonstration of a lack of understanding by him and his party of what
confronts the Department of Labour in terms of what was inherited by this
democratic Government. [Interjections.] We congratulate the Minister and
his department on having achieved what they have planned to achieve in the
previous financial year.

Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to highlight a few achievements of the Department of Labour.
Recently, the Department of Labour has shown its capability, and has
achieved the following: Some information labour centres were established at
workplaces, statistics and provincial unit structures, training programmes
which were established in terms of information and seminars, empowerment,
analysis and dissemination of information, such as the annual Unemployment
Insurance Beneficiaries report also accessed information in regard to the
information which was gathered from workplaces throughout the country.

In the past years there have been some intensive programmes, the sole aim
of which was to research the policy of the Department of Labour. All this
was possible because of the efforts and leadership qualities of the
Minister of Labour as well as the ANC.]
The library services that were introduced within these programmes, with up
to date and relevant material on labour- related issues, were made
available to ensure that the daily needs of the various stakeholders within
the labour market are being met. We want to urge the public to utilise
these services that are being provided by the ANC-led Government - I think
that is what we promised in our election manifesto.

Critical to this programme was the issue of information regarding the
impact of HIV/Aids on the labour market. Consequent to that, the Minister
immediately released a statement stipulating a code of good practice in May
2000. In this statement the Minister said, and I quote:


  The Department of Labour has recognised that the HIV/Aids epidemic is one
  of the most serious public health problems facing our country. Not only
  is it an epidemic which threatens the lives of individual workers and
  employers, but it also poses a significant threat to each and every
  workplace, and the effective functioning of the labour market and the
  national economy as a whole.

Because of the impact that HIV/Aids has on the workplace, such as
absenteeism, increased accidents, loss of skills and labour, increased
labour costs and a decrease in employee morale, it was quite clear that the
companies which this party represents, were going to start victimising
people that are HIV-positive. I think the code of good practice was aimed
at ensuring that those people are protected. It stated that there will be
no discrimination on the basis of HIV status and no protesting by
employers, unless there is an authorisation from the Labour Court. I think
that makes it clear that this Government is not going to tolerate any form
of discrimination against people who are HIV-positive. I think we need to
encourage people to come out in the open and give them a guarantee that
they will not be rejected or victimised.

South Africa's labour market continues to reflect divergent trends with
continual weaknesses in the formal sector, contrasting with employment and
income growth in the informal sector. This is a direct response to a
decline in the apartheid-era restrictions, and informal economic activity.
Flexible short-term contract labour has increased, and incomes in this
sector have grown more rapidly than in the formal sector. The services
provided by the labour market policy programme should follow such
employment trends and develop policy initiatives on how the services that
were meant, by and large, for the formal sector are being redirected into
informal and vibrant economic activity.

In this regard, I want to request the Minister and his department to
investigate the continuing restructuring in the formal sector, which, I
believe, has negative consequences for Government's comprehensive response
to the HIV/Aids scourge. This is because some workers who are part of
restructuring or who are passed on to independent contractors, had been
receiving a particular support service from their principal employer and
this service immediately got discontinued. The point here is that the
outsourcing process, although it has positives and negatives, is being
abused by some big companies that discontinue the services that they used
to provide when they outsource and contract out some of their operations.

The formal sector is currently providing skills development, health
services, welfare and social security. Is the informal sector capable of
delivering such services? The answer is quite clearly no. The labour market
policy programme constitutes a measure towards achieving a balance between
security and flexibility, and contributes to the growth of the economy and
job creation on a sustainable basis. Outsourcing work to independent
contractors by the formal business sector, under the guise of international
competitiveness, is already contributing to the high rate of unemployment,
widespread poverty among low-wage earners and extreme levels of inequality.

As an approach to labour market policy that responds to the needs of the
most vulnerable, the department must investigate, as it has been mentioned
that there is a planned joint operation with the Department of Water
Affairs and Forestry to ensure that the forestry industry complies with
labour laws. We want to applaud the Minister for that initiative.

The department will realise, as a result of the fragmented nature of the
labour market and the multiple problems associated with it, that further
damage cannot be afforded. The forestry industry is currently a culprit in
this regard. We want to urge the Minister to move swiftly in investigating
the outcomes of the outsourcing exercises in this industry, because the
conditions of the employees are becoming less favourable than they were
when they were still in the employ of the principal employer.

To reverse the failures of the apartheid labour market we require an
integrated and coherent socioeconomic strategy, such as that advanced by
the Reconstruction and Development Programme. The rapid growth of
subcontracting labour brokers and independent contractors is beginning to
expose the fact that labour regulations may be too flexible and that there
is a need for more enforcement. The result of outsourcing is the
recomposition of the workforce into insecure, casual and temporary workers
with little access to benefits, unions or effective minimum standards. Such
a situation requires the urgent attention of the provincial service
delivery system.

In conclusion, I would like to remind the private sector that gender
inequality in their managerial and professional strata remains a hindrance
to the transformation and democratisation of our labour market. We wish the
department success in implementing the 15-point programme of action and
call on all South Africans to join the President in his call for ``unity in
action for change''. The ANC fully supports the Vote. [Applause.]

Mr A BLAAS: Chairperson, we clearly noticed the uniform of the hon the
Minister, and when he indicated to us that he was an inspector, I was
afraid that he would start singing Leon Schuster's song, whose lyrics go
something like this: ``I am an inspector, and I have a badge.''
[Interjections.]

There are a few things that I picked up from the hon the Minister's speech
that I would like to address. Firstly, there it is the issue of the
Unemployment Insurance Fund. The UIF has built up an unrecoverable debt,
and it is technically insolvent - that is a known fact. Indications are
that at the end of March 2001, the UIF owed the Department of Labour an
amount of R244,6 million. The only available money to cover this debt is an
amount of R7 million provided for in the budget of the Department. There is
no chance that the UIF will be able to repay the department. Therefore, how
is the Minister going to recover these funds?

Arising out of the problems with the UIF, the Minister tabled the new
Unemployment Insurance Bill, of which the main reforms proposed seek to
address some shortcomings in the current legislation. The thrust of the
Bill is to make the fund financially viable. What is of concern is that no
reliable actuarial calculations normally required in setting up insurance
funds exist to support the reform measures intended to make the fund
viable. Even the department is in doubt.

In the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, it is stated that after 2002 the
state will not be called upon to contribute to or even guarantee the fund.
On the other hand, provision is made in the budget under medium-term
expenditure for the transfer of R7 million to the fund until 2004. If the
Department of Labour doubts the success of their own proposed legislation,
it would be difficult for us to support the Bill. The financial viability
of the new fund must be based on sound actuarial calculations. With
negative growth in jobs and job opportunities, even more challenges will be
faced by the fund.

Talking about unemployment, I would like to pick up on a few other things.
The need for growth has already been stated. To achieve this, we need a
common goal to which all South Africans can aspire. It must form the basis
on which Government, business, organised labour and civil society can
justly conduct actions and make decisions.

We as South Africans must make the commitment to the initiatives set up to
position this country as the only emerging market for both domestic and
international investors. This is the vision of the hon the President. To be
able to achieve this, many actions must be taken, some in the labour
environment, which can be listed as follows: We must stop the brain drain;
we need increased labour-market flexibility; transformation must be done
incrementally, in step with the constraints of our society; we should not
try to fix everything that is wrong in South Africa all at once; the skills
development programmes must be needs-driven and fast-tracked and job
retention should be enhanced.

Die vraag is hoe presteer ons in antwoord op sommige van dié behoeftes. Die
eerste vraag handel oor die program van vaardigheidsontwikkeling wat
behoeftegedrewe moet wees. Ons weet die departement doen baie ten opsigte
van dié programme. Daar is wette op die Wetboek, daar is toegewysde geld,
soveel as R400 miljoen wat beskikbaar sal kom vir dié doel, daar is
verskeie strukture beskikbaar en daar is reeds baie navorsing en beplanning
gedoen.

Die departement se talle suksesse blyk uit die jaarverslag. Wat ons egter
in die verslag wil sien, is in watter mate die programme aan die behoeftes
van die mark voldoen en watter gekwantifiseerde waarde die Regering daaruit
kry. Die afleiding wat uit die verslag gemaak word, is dat daar 'n lomp
burokrasie geskep is en ons weet nie presies wat die kwantifiseerbare
resultate is waarna dié burokrasie moet streef nie. Ons wil graag sien wat
die land se behoefte in spesifieke vaardighede en sektore is om dié
groeikoers te steun.

Verder wil ons ook weet watter sukses opleiding behaal het, aangepas vir 'n
groeikoers oor die medium termyn en in watter mate aan hierdie behoeftes
voldoen is. Daar kan ook nie uit die verslag afgelei word watter waarde die
heffingbetalers toegeval het of wat die impak op produktiwiteit was nie.

Die agb Minister het aangedui dat 15% van die mense wat opgelei is wel in
die arbeidsmark teruggeplaas is. Die Minister het melding gemaak van die
beoogde wysigings aan die arbeidswet. Een van die vereistes wat ons stel,
is dat die arbeidsmark aanpasbaar moet wees en dat wette nie rigied moet
wees nie.

Die Minister het gesê die wetgewing moet nou afgehandel word en ons kan nie
met hom verskil nie. Die proses sloer te lank en die tyd vir dié wetgewing
is reeds verstreke. Ek sou graag by die Minister wou hoor wat sy beoogde
sperdatums vir die afhandeling van die werk is. Dit moet ongetwyfeld
spoedig wees, maar ek wil graag weet wanneer hy beoog om die wysigings op
die wette finaal op die Wetboek te hê.

'n Ander aspek waaraan ons aandag moet skenk, is dat die departement
sensitief moet wees vir die impak wat regulasies en burokratiese
voorskrifte op die kostestruktuur van klein- en mediumondernemings het.
Daar bestaan talle voorbeelde hiervan. Dit lei daartoe dat ondernemings nie
op hul opbrengs kan oorleef nie. In sulke gevalle is dit beter om die
ondernemings te sluit en die geld te belê. Dit het 'n negatiewe invloed op
werkgeleenthede en, soos ons weet, lê ons ekonomiese groei en werkskepping
in die klein- en mediumgrootte ondernemings.
Ons het ook inligting oor die kernprestasies van die Direktoraat:
Arbeidsverhoudinge in die jaarverslag gemis. Die agb Minister het wel gesê
daar was 'n afname in stakings en ook 'n afname in die verlies aan werk-ure
as gevolg van stakings. Wat ons egter ook in die verslag wou lees, is
hoeveel van dié stakings regstreeks aan arbeid gekoppel kan word, hoeveel
betrekking op dispute in die werkplek het en hoeveel stakings hoegenaamd
niks met die werkomgewing te doen het nie. Stakings het 'n negatiewe
uitwerking op ons ekonomie en kan moontlik as ekonomiese sabotasie
gedefinieer word. Stakings het ook 'n invloed op die regte van die gewone
onskuldige landsburgers wat in dié sektor sake doen.

Ek wil ook aandag skenk aan menslike hulpbronne en die behoud daarvan. [Tyd
verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The question is how we are doing in response to some of these
requirements. The first question deals with the skills development
programme that should be needs-driven. We know that the department is doing
a great deal in respect of these programmes. There are Acts on the Statute
Book, money - as much as R400 million - has been allocated that is going to
be made available for this purpose, there are various structures available
and a great deal of research and planning has already taken place.

The department's many successes are apparent from the annual report.
However, what we would like to see in the annual report is to what extent
the programmes comply with the requirements of the market and what
quantified value the Government will gain from them. The deduction that can
be made from the report is that a clumsy bureaucracy has been created and
that we do not know exactly what the quantified results are that this
bureaucracy should strive to achieve. We would like to see what the
requirements of the country are in respect of specific skills and sectors
to support this growth rate.

Furthermore we would also like to know what success training has had,
adjusted to a growth rate over the medium term, and to what extent these
requirements were met. Nor can one deduce from the report what value
accrued to the payers of the levy or what the impact on productivity was.

The hon the Minister indicated that 15% of the people who had been trained
were in fact placed back in the labour market. The Minister made mention of
the envisaged amendments to labour legislation. One of our requirements is
that the labour market should be adaptable and that laws should not be
rigid.

The Minister said the legislation should now be completed and we cannot
disagree with him. The process has already been dragging on for too long
and the time for this legislation has already expired. I would like to hear
from the Minister what his envisaged cut-off dates are for the completion
of the work. It must undoubtedly be soon, but I would like to know when he
envisages finally having the laws on the Statute Book.

Another aspect to which we must give attention is that the department must
be sensitive to the impact that regulations and bureaucratic prescriptions
have on the cost structure of small and medium enterprises. There are many
examples of this. This is the cause of enterprises being unable to survive
on their turnover. In such cases it is better to close down the enterprises
and invest the money. This has a negative effect on job opportunities and,
as we know, our economic growth and job creation depend on the small and
medium enterprises.
We also missed information on the key achievements of the Directorate:
Labour Relations in the annual report. The hon the Minister in fact said
that there was a decline in strikes and also a reduction in the loss of
working hours owing to strikes. What we would also have liked to read in
the report, however, is how many of these strikes could be linked directly
to labour, how many involved disputes in the workplace and how many strikes
had absolutely nothing to do with the working environment. Strikes have a
negative impact on our economy and could possibly be defined as economic
sabotage. Strikes also have an effect on the rights of the ordinary
innocent citizens of the country that do business in this sector.

I would also like to give attention to human resources and their retention.

[Ms T E ḼISHIVHA: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, under the
leadership of President Thabo Mbeki, what we are discussing today is not
something new. It is well known that our people did not know what the
proper channels were to follow in their work places. The same applies to
farm workers and domestic workers.

That is why President Thabo Mbeki, in his state of the nation address,
indicated that employers must participate in the education of their
employees, irrespective of where the person works. All public servants must
also be trained in order to improve their education while working.

All these wonders were made possible by the ANC-led Government. The
Department of Labour came up with a plan in which it requested
businesspeople to participate in this education. Our people used to suffer
because they worked without proper skills and knowledge. They used to get
hurt while working in stony areas without protective clothing. That is why
it is vital that people should have knowledge and skills regarding the work
that they perform.

The previous apartheid government failed to do all these things. This Act
was passed in 1981, but developed nothing. When the democratic Government
led by President Thabo Mbeki came into power, it had a vision. We are aware
that the ANC-led Government is the people's Government. That is why we say,
a better life for all!

The South African Qualifications Authority Act of 1995, the Skills
Development Act of 1998 and the Skills Development Levies Act of 1999 were
passed.]

These three Acts highlight the promotion of development and the insuring of
quality in education and training.

[In 1999, the LMSDP was started. Its findings were extremely important.
Some of its important functions were already visible by 2000, when we had
27 Setas. Provincial plans were also developed.

They drew up the plans which will be used in the next five years.
Provincial training forums were started. To show that the ANC-led
Government and the Department of Labour are working, as far as skills and
training are concerned, today they managed to arrest two people who were
involved in corruption. These people took the money which was earmarked for
training people and used it to entertain their friends, their relatives and
themselves.

If we look at the years 2000-02, Parliament put aside R100 million to help
train the unemployed. Fifty teachers trained 572 people at 54 training
centres. People learned various things. Our people were not aware that when
they have problems they can go for counselling. The Department of Labour
has made it possible for there to be places where they can go for
counselling when they have lost their jobs.

Twenty-four training centres were established. Ten plans for provincial
training were also accepted. All this was made possible by working
together, because if we are not supportive, it will be time-consuming and,
thus, difficult. Let us agree that it was not the ANC alone which
campaigned during the elections, but all organisations promised the people
that they would do a variety of things for them. When it comes to delivery,
they expect the ANC to do it alone. Opposition parties do not want to
support the ANC in bringing services to the people.

That is why the ANC is not afraid to go to the people today. When people
are trained, leaders must also be trained. Last year, a total of 350 staff
members, together with Indlela, were trained. If we look at Indlela, its
aim is to increase the equipment and to visit different training centres,
so that those who are still using old training methods, can improve on
them.

Different methods were used while they where trying to bring knowledge and
training. For example, if we can look at Mpumalanga, they now have such a
place with the assistance of the Netherlands. If we support the Government
in its endeavour to help the people, it will be easy for us because we now
have 2 000 people who are participating in training and skills seminars. Up
to now 1 400 have shown up.

What must we do to encourage these things? We must encourage, support,
develop, and investigate in order to increase the number of scientists and
their assistance. The Government wants to see employers encouraging and
participating in the education of their employees by improving their
knowledge with regard to their development of the community.

Young entrepreneurs should improve their knowledge. In February last year,
the South African Revenue Service found that some employers were, at least,
registered in accordance with the Skills Development Levies Act. We found
out that since July last year skills development levies have been taken to
the department on a monthly basis. We must not forget that all these things
were made possible by the ANC Government, led by President Thabo Mbeki.

Currently, 60% of companies are now registered, and 40% are still being
investigated.]

The skills levy revenue is collected between April and August. The Skills
Development Act will ensure that companies train their employees. Companies
will soon feel the effects of having trained and stimulated their staff. If
companies invest in their staff by giving them the correct and applicable
training, the returns gained can be astronomical.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon member. Hon Hangana?

Ms N E HANGANA: Chairperson, we are trying to follow the hon member's
speech, but I think that the area that needs to be improved is the
translation. The translation is very bad.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon Hangana. I notice that the
translation is very poor in this regard. I think the table will assist me
in doing something. [Interjections.]

Hon Lishivha, you still had about two minutes left to speak when you were
disturbed. Oh, you are finished. Okay. Then your speaking time has expired.
[Applause.]
Mr M N RAMODIKE: Chairperson, the aim and key objective of the Department
of Labour is to play a significant role in the reduction of unemployment
...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, you are making a noise.
Can you please lower your voices?

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Mr Chairperson, the aim and key objective of the
Department of Labour is to play a significant role in the reduction of
unemployment, poverty and inequality, in conjunction with other role-
players in the workplace. The Department's total expenditure outcome for
the financial years 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 for the realisation of
skills development and job creation and as central tenets of Government's
socioeconomic strategy, amounts to R669 645 million, including the adjusted
appropriation for 2001.

Ka lebaka leo, UDM e tla thekga polelo ya gago, Mohlomphegi Tona, polelo ya
maikemišetšo a go hlola dibaka tša mešomo. [Therefore, the UDM would like
to support the Minister's initiatives in respect of job creation.]

The UDM wants to know, however, from the hon the Minister how many job
opportunities his department has, in conjunction with all other Government
departments, created over these past years?

The department's 15 point programme of action for 1999 up to 2004,
identifies job creation as the biggest challenge facing the Government. The
Department of Labour co-ordinates Government's role in the follow-up to the
Jobs Summit. The Jobs Summit reached an agreement on a social plan launched
by the hon the Minister during July 1999, which encompasses phases of
intervention, namely avoiding job losses through, inter alia, future forums
between workers and employers about the future of their industry and to
identify threats to jobs timeously.

The UDM wants to know from the hon the Minister how many jobs were saved in
both the private and the public sectors during the 1999-2000 financial year
through the Jobs Summit social plan agreement. What were the achievements
of the provincial offices of the department which were approached for
services in mitigating the impact of retrenchments on workers. How many of
these provincial offices took steps to regenerate local economies where
retrenched workers reside?

The labour movement continues to criticise Government on the privatisation
of public enterprises, which is said to be a direct cause of job losses.
The UDM requests the department to provide statistical information on jobs
lost as a result of privatisation of public enterprises in order to have a
clear picture of the concerns of the labour movement. In terms of policy
development, Cabinet recently approved the creation of a single statute in
respect of occupational health and safety and for compensation
competencies, in order to integrate the fragmented functions and
responsibilities which are presently entrusted to the Departments of
Health, of Labour and of Minerals and Energy.

It is irreconcilable to note that the Departments of Health and of Minerals
and Energy continue to provide for the promotion of safety and health in
terms of the 2001 estimates of national expenditure. In spite of this
Cabinet decision, it is alarming to note that medical expenses of
Government officials paid by the compensation fund increased from R7 931
million to R16 467 million, and account for average programme growth of
7,8% a year over the seven-year period, as indicated in the item
Expenditure.

I agree with the Minister that legislation aimed at strengthening the
administration of the fund, minimisation of fraud and implementing an
effective credit agreement should be put in place as a matter of urgency.
In view of the proposed Unemployment Insurance Fund, the UDM proposes that
domestic and seasonal workers should be included in the Act.

Ke rata go thekga kgopolo le kgopelo ya Mohlomphegi Morena Blade Nzimande

[I would like to support the idea and the appeal by the hon Mr Blade
Nzimande of the SACP that the Government should pass the legislation to
strengthen corporations and the National Bank, so that workers could
benefit. I also agree with him that the Development Bank, the Land Bank,
the Khula Post Bank and the IDT, should open these doors for their
workers.]

Employer organisations, the labour movement and civil society noted with
keen interest a survey which was conducted by Statistics SA in co-operation
with the International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour, which
is part of the International Labour Organisation. The involvement of the
Department in the establishment of provincial structures of child labour
intersectoral groups was well received. The biggest problem, however, is
that the practice of child labour continues unabated, especially on the
farms. The UDM proposes that trade unions, employer associations and civil
society organisations should all be involved in the elimination of child
labour, in conjunction with the department's child labour monitoring
intersectoral groups.

[Hon Minister, attention could be given to the practice of transporting
workers in the back of vehicles like trucks and tractors. It is saddening
to realise that during the rainy season or in windy conditions, farmworkers
are being transported in such vehicles as if they are animals or soldiers.
I would like to thank the Minister. The nation is eagerly awaiting jobs
from him and the Minister of Public Works. They are asking for jobs.]

Mong M J G MZONDEKI: Modulasetulo, ke motlotlo ho nka karolo kganng yena ya
tsatsi lena. Ke kena kganng yena ke nahana hore le nna ke tla ba le seabo.
Puo ya ka tsatsing lena e tla ikamahanya le tshireletseho ya basebetsi
dibakeng tsa mesebetsi, e leng le leng la mananeo a Lefapha la tsa
Mesebetsi. (Translation of Sesotho paragraph follows.)

[Mr M J G MZONDEKI: Chairperson, I am proud to take part in today's debate.
I am entering this debate, thinking that I will also make a contribution.
My input today will be based on the safety of workers in the workplace,
which is one of the programmes of the Department of Labour.]

I want to join this debate remembering the many casualties of unsafe
working conditions inside and outside of work. I want to remember the
casualties of the Lenasia incident, the recent incident at Beatrix mine and
many others that people are aware of. Many people have lost their lives in
about 600 workplace fatalities in the past five years. Many were left
incapacitated with no alternative occupations, either surviving on state
grants or some small pension for those who were lucky enough to be
registered and covered for injuries on duty.

Even though some of the victims could still make a contribution and earn an
income, the lack of commitment by employers to rehabilitate and retrain
such employees for re-entry into the labour market, has made it difficult.
I am happy that the hon the Minister has recently launched a draft code of
good practice on key aspects of disability in the workplace.

I want to caution that this code must, however, not be used to relax our
efforts to promote healthy and safe workplaces. It must serve to prevent
unfair discrimination against those who are injured through or in
unavoidable circumstances. The impact of unsafe and unhealthy working
conditions on production is enormous. An estimated figure of R17 billion in
1996 alone was spent as a result of occupational accidents, and that was
about 3,5% of GDP.

As the hon the Minister mentioned, the countrywide inspection blitz
undertaken recently revealed that noncompliance is a major contributor to
accidents. Employers either do not know their obligations, or they ignore
them and prioritise profits at the expense of the workers' lives. Workers
also seem to be ignorant of their right to a safe and healthy working
environment.

The primary function of occupational health and safety is to promote the
health and safety of people in the workplace. The department is thus
committed to improving inspections and investigations at workplaces. It is
committed to a restructured inspectorate service. An integrated
inspectorate and enforcement service is in place.

The new model replaces the old one, in which the department had three
inspection services, each specialising in either labour ralations or
occupational health and safety, and compliance with unemployment services.
The new integrated model multiskills inspectors and ensures that there is a
one-stop service. This is in compliance with the ANC's commitment to bring
services closer to the people. According to the Department of Labour's
annual report of 2000, the implementation of this model is yielding good
results. For the year 2000, 10 060 inspections were conducted, as against a
target of 6 408, and we are on course.

We do understand, however, that there will be problems during this process,
as is always the case with transformation. There will be those who want to
convince us that this model is not working, simply because they are
comfortable to be specialists and idle when there is no other work for
their area of specialisation. There will be those who just do not believe
in change, especially if it benefits the majority of the people who have
been suffering. But that is what the ANC is committed to - a change for a
better life for all.

There are still challenges facing us in this area. One of them is the
poaching of inspectors. The low remuneration of staff by the Department of
Labour makes it difficult to attract and retain skilled staff. The
Department of Labour operated at an inspector vacancy rate of 47% in the
year 2000. But I am still happy about the good job that has been done by
the inspectors. It is unfortunate that I cannot see them. I am told that
they are up there in the gallery.

The other challenge is that occupational health and safety has no
jurisdiction in other areas of employment, such as on mines, line ships,
fishing boats and within the general public affected through work-related
activities. These areas fall within other inspectorates. The department
has, however, initiated co-operative governance in this regard. A forum has
been established in which the Department of Labour and the Department of
Minerals and Energy meet regularly. Meetings are also held with other
departments, such as the Departments of Health and of Environmental
Affairs. The purpose of this initiative is to try and harmonise legislation
in this regard, as well as to minimise duplication of services where
possible. We believe, as the ANC, that this will go a long way towards
addressing the question of health and safety.

The health and safety issue is not the sole responsibility of the
Government. There will never be enough inspectors to ensure that there are
no accidents caused by negligence and noncompliance. In his speech at the
launch of the occupational heath and safety awareness campaign in March
2001, the hon the Minister had this to say, and I quote:


  Today we witness the first steps being taken towards the development of a
  common vision amongst the three critical social partners in the
  occupational health and safety arena - a common vision which I am
  optimistic will, in the not too distant future, see labour, business and
  Government declare, on a public platform, a collective commitment to
  ensure that occupational health and safety in the workplace receives the
  priority it deserves.

Ke rata ho phephetsa basebetsi, ka ho re ba etse ka matla hore Dikomiti tsa

(Translation of Sesotho paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to encourage workers, to ensure that they have safety
committees in workplaces. They should strengthen those committees and their
representatives by taking part in the committees' programmes relating to
safety at work, and clarifying the right of workers to safe workplaces.

If safety conditions are not up to standard, then their lives are also not
what they should be, because the economy is also affected and employers are
then forced to close down places of work. An example of this is the closure
of the Beatrix mine.

Reports show that 2,4% of accidents are caused by ill health.]

We need to ensure that this figure does not escalate. Therefore it is
important that the three critical role-players, namely labour, business and
Government, must declare war on unsafe and hazardous working conditions.
I appeal to all the public representatives in this House to commit
themselves and join the three stakeholders in ensuring that our programmes
include monitoring health and safety issues wherever we are. Too many
people have died and too many have been left incapacitated.

The ANC supports this Vote. [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Mr Chairman, please excuse my voice. Having heard the
grandiloquent twaddle by my ex-teacher, the Minister, I am persuaded still
to challenge him on the issue of unemployment. I would like to acknowledge
that he has done a lot to ameliorate the adversarial relationships that
have existed in the labour market. However, the Minister stated that he has
shifted from policy-making to policy implementation. I would suggest that
he shift back to policy-making on the following issue: the Ministry has to
answer the recurrent question of what it can do within its power to
encourage economic growth and job creation.

The issue of the degree of unemployment can no longer be determined through
disputed statistics. It is a matter easily determinable, because by simply
walking out of the parliamentary precinct one would see many unemployed
people in the street. So, as long as unemployment is rampant, this
challenge remains with the Ministry.

The President gave a hint of the probable direction the Ministry and the
entire executive should take when he mentioned the fact that he would like
to attract more investment by reducing the cost of labour, without
compromising safety and minimum living conditions. I have yet to see what
the economic cluster has planned, or the strategy it intends to implement,
to execute the directive that the President stated here before us. So my
view is that, as long as unemployment persists, the Ministry has not
discharged one of its major functions. Nonetheless, having said so, I
support the Vote.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, die sprekerslys wat ek in besit
het, lui anders.

Die agb Minister van Arbeid sê: ``We are on course. The amendments are
coming'', maar ek wil vir die agb lede sê die agb Minister het verlede jaar
in Augustus by Beeld Forum gepraat en tóé reeds gesê die einde van die jaar
2000 was die spertyd vir amendemente en wysigings aan die arbeidswette. Nou
wil ek vir hierdie agb Minister die volgende sê: (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairman, the speakers' list I have reads
differently.

The hon the Minister of Labour says: ``We are on course. The amendments are
coming'', but I want to say to hon members that the hon the Minister spoke
at Beeld Forum in August last year, and said at that stage already that the
end of the year 2000 was the cut-off date for amendments and changes to the
labour legislation. Now I want to say the following to this hon Minister:]

He is on course; the amendments are coming. However, last year they were
coming, but Christmas came. I want to say to the hon the Minister that
Christmas is also coming this year.

Die agb Minister verwys na die ``racism of the past'', maar ek wil vir hom
sê die wet oor gelyke indiensneming, die sogenaamde ``affirmative action'',
diskrimineer veral teen jong, blanke mense. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die jongmense
was nie deel van apartheid nie. Die blankes wat huidig universiteite
bywoon, en wat binnekort die arbeidsmark betree, was nie deel van apartheid
nie. Sommige van hulle het nog nie eens gestem nie.

Indien die agb Minister die natuurlike proses ooreenkomstig meriete sou
gevolg het, sal dit beteken dat die ekonomiese groeikoers in Suid-Afrika
ongeveer 9% sou moes wees om sy doelwit van 'n 80% swart werksmag te
bereik. Dit is egter op die oomblik tussen 2% en 3%. Die agb Minister sê
slegs 7% van die bestuurskader bestaan uit swartmense.

Kom ons gaan dan na die grondvlak van die werkers toe. Kom ons vat die myne
in Suid-Afrika. Wat is die samestelling in die laer echelons van die
werkersklas? Daar kom blankes nie ter sprake nie, maar dan gee die Regering
en die agb Minister nie om of daar diskriminasie is teen ons jong blanke
mense nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The hon the Minister refers to the racism of the past, but I want to say
to him that the Act on employment equity, the so-called ``affirmative
action'', discriminates in particular against young white people.
[Interjections.] The young people were not part of apartheid. The whites
who are at present at universities and who will shortly be entering the
labour market were not part of apartheid. Some of them have not even voted
yet.

If the hon the Minister had followed the natural process according to merit
it would mean that the economic growth rate in South Africa would have had
to be approximately 9% to reach his target of a 80% black labour force.
However, at the moment it is between 2% and 3%. The hon the Minister says
only 7% of the management cadre consists of blacks.

Let us go to the workers at grass-roots level. Let us look at the mines in
South Africa. What is the composition in the lower echelons of the working
class? Here whites do not come into the picture, but, then again, the
Government and the hon the Minister do not care if there is discrimination
against our young white people.]

The hon Minister refers to the racism of the past, but he and his
colleagues in the ANC Government are busy with the racism of the future.

'n AGB LID: Ag, twak!

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Dit is die waarheid, en ek weet die waarheid maak
gewoonlik seer.

Maar ek moet darem vir die agb Minister sê dat hy so bietjie 'n verandering
ondergaan het in terme van arbeidswetgewing. Die agb Minister dra daardie
blou hoed nie omdat hy kwansuis wil sê hy is 'n inspekteur nie, hy kan nie
op straat verskyn nie, want hy is bang hulle slaan hom oor die kop. Dit is
hoekom hy 'n veiligheidshoed moet dra.

Die agb Minister bring veranderings aan, maar al kom hy met veranderings,
die sakeondernemings is besig om toe te maak. Kelvinator in Alberton is
gelikwideer. Ongeveer 1 200 werkgeleenthede is daarmee heen. Waverley
Blankets in Oos-London in die provinsie waar hulle sê 80% van die mense ly
aan hongersnood, het verlede jaar in November sy fabrieke begin toemaak en
hy gaan na Botswana toe. Dit is ongeveer 1 000 werkgeleenthede wat daarmee
heen is.

Hierso in Kaapstad verklaar die media die personeelbesnoeiings by BMD
Textiles as volg: ``Labour laws blamed for rag trade job cuts''.

Die agb Minister moet begin beweeg. Hy moet doen wat hy sê. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[An HON MEMBER: Oh, nonsense!

Mr P J GROENEWALD: It is the truth, and I know that the truth usually
hurts.

But I do want to tell the hon the Minister that he has changed a little in
respect of labour legislation. The hon the Minister is not wearing that
blue hat because he is suggesting that he is an inspector, he cannot appear
in public, because he is afraid they will hit him over the head. That is
why he has to wear a safety helmet.

The hon the Minister is effecting changes, but even if he comes up with
changes, businesses are closing down. Kelvinator in Alberton has been
liquidated. Approximately 1 200 job opportunities have been lost. Waverley
Blankets in East London, in the province in which they say 80% of the
people are starving, started closing its factories in November last year
and is moving to Botswana. That is approximately 1 000 job opportunities
that have been lost.

Here in Cape Town the media has explained the retrenchment of staff at BMD
Textiles as follows: ``Labour laws blamed for rag trade job cuts''.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chair, it is rather surprising that we had quite a few

The MF compliments the Department of Labour on its significant role in
reducing unemployment, poverty and inequality through policies and
programmes developed in consultation with the relevant role-players.

Ngithi kuNgqongqoshe: Sawubona. Ngiyasithanda leso sigqoko sakhe, sihle.
[To the hon Minister I say: ``Hello. I like your hat, it is beautiful.]

It is remarkable to take note of the eight key programmes aimed at skills
development and job creation, namely administration, occupational health
and safety for workers, social insurance, employment and skills development
services, labour relations, labour policy, service delivery and auxiliary
and associated services.

The South African labour force is presently under tremendous stress with
the impact of the HIV/Aids pandemic on the labour force, resulting in
increased medical expenses and an increased mortality rate. This, in turn,
also strongly impacts on the economy with additional costs incurred by
companies with the recruitment and training of new staff.

The MF recommends that all employees familiarise themselves with the
Employment Equity Act and the Labour Relations Act, so as not to fall
victim to exploitation and unfair labour practices. It is also recommended
that all employees request a contract of employment from the beginning of
the working relationship. This contract, which is an agreement between
employer and employee, clearly stipulates the employee's period of
employment and the benefits, and protects both employer and employee from
possible problems that may be encountered in the future.

The divergent labour market trends in South Africa have a negative impact
on the formal sector, and contrast sharply with unemployment and
incomparable growth in the informal sector. The MF is of the opinion that
there is a need for continuous restructuring in the formal sector so as to
increase the employment rate.

The MF recognises the Government's initiative in its contribution to skills
development, with the establishment of the 25 sector education and training
authorities, including several learnership programmes. The MF finds it
disheartening that the slow-down in economic activity has resulted in
slower real wage growth. However, it is pleasing to note that moderate
formal sector earnings have been matched by better income distributions.
[Interjections.]

The MF is satisfied that the global expansion of South African firms holds
significant benefits for the economy and that the Government remains
committed to a gradual approach to exchange control liberalisation.
However, the South African labour market needs to be on the alert for
potential risks to the forecasts, which include a hard landing in the US
economy, renewed cut-backs in oil production and a decline in business
confidence. On the other hand, key positive factors to look forward to are
lower crude oil prices and lower inflation. The MF supports Vote No 27:
Labour.

Ms H F MALEBANA: Modulasetulo, gammogo le maloko a Palamente ao a

Chairperson, hon members, I would like to say this to the Minister ...]

... indeed we are on course. Voters in their masses gave the ANC an open,
clear and direct mandate. They said they had suffered enough. The South
African masses are dying of hunger and poverty, and are tired of a lack of
improvement in their lives.

In the 1999 election manifesto the ANC committed itself to speeding up
delivery and advancing worker rights through the consolidation of
legislation in order to protect workers and ensure effective implementation
by focusing on the improvement of the quality of service delivery and
efficiency in the use of public resources in all areas of Government. This
will be realised because the Department of Labour channelled the bulk of
its budget to a new programme called service delivery for obvious reasons
of implementation of laws and ensuring effective and efficient client-
oriented service delivery. The Department of Labour has embarked on a
programme to create an environment conducive to job creation, which aims to
enforce the various labour laws and provide a one-stop service through the
establishment of business units in the provincial offices of the department
in order to foster service delivery.

Labour senthase mo diprofenseng di ile tša hlongwa go kgonthišiša gore

(Translation of Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[The labour centres in the provinces were established to ensure that people
got appropriate services. The Department of Labour has succeeded in
delivering appropriate services, so that workers can access services which
are offered by these labour centres in the provinces.
This will help to ensure that information and other services are accessed
by the majority of people in the provinces, so that their communities and
workers with various problems can access appropriate information and
services.

Legislation passed by the Parliament will also have to be interpreted, so
that the communities can access appropriate assistance from these centres.
Those who are injured while at work will also be assisted in filling in
forms that will be processed by the department, so that they can be
assisted as a matter of urgency. In order to ensure that everyone is bound
by the laws of this country - workers, employers and the unemployed - there
is a unit of inspectors to ensure that no one is breaking the law and
jeopardising the safety of workers.

As the ANC Government, we are saying that we are tired of accidents that
injure the workers who are the breadwinners of their communities.]

On 28 June 1999 the Minister announced, in this House, the 15 point
programme of action for 1999-2004 which flowed from the presidential Jobs
Summit. The social plan seeks to put in place three sets of measures, and
these are, firstly, to prevent retrenchments from taking place; secondly,
that where retrenchments are unavoidable, they should be managed humanely;
and thirdly, that where retrenchments have taken place, measures should be
put in place to assist the affected invididuals and communities to find
alternative forms of employment or sustainable livelihoods.

I would like to say to the hon the Minister that capacity-building at
provincial level is a necessity. In his state of the nation address, the
hon President, Thabo Mbeki, stressed the need for human resource
development. The committee undertook provincial visits to acquaint itself
with the frustrations and achievements experienced by workers as regards
service delivery.

paragraphs follows.)

[Though problems vary, according to information laws and objectives and
services, a committee found that there was a need for resources to help
employees in the Department of Public Works, together with those seeking
services. There is a need for proper training so that service seekers and
employees would be able to provide the services and co-operation to avoid a
delay that will consume much for those not working. Understanding the
policies is also necessary to have better procedures for necessary matters.

Employees are saying they are sick and tired of corruption and bribery,
which causes the nation to lose confidence in the Government's objective of
appropriately providing important services.

The biggest task for the CCMA is to mediate in cases where there are
misunderstandings between employees and employers. If the CCMA's commission
fails to reach an agreement and understanding to resolve the dispute, the
complainant is issued with a certificate declaring that the dispute has not
been resolved and allowing the complainant to go for arbitration or take
the matter to the Labour Court.]

The main objective of the CCMA is to avoid, at all costs, labour disputes
between employers and employees.

(Translation of Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[Since the establishment of the CCMA, there has been a remarkable decrease
in the number of cases involving misunderstandings between employers and
employees. It also made it possible to assist and allow employees to return
to their jobs.

In Sepedi we say: A person endeavouring to achieve that which is for the
best, is the one who gets support. It is useless for Parliament to pass
laws, if those laws will not be of any use to the nation in speeding up the
improvement of people's lives.]

The RDP document states that the objective of human resource development is
to address capabilities, abilities, knowledge and the know-how to meet the
people's ever-growing needs for goods and services, in order to improve
their standard of living and quality of life.

paragraph follows.)

[It is important for all workers in the Department of Labour, from those at
the head office down to those in the provincial and local offices, to be
given proper training that will give them more knowledge, skills and
creativity. There should be programmes and publications to give them an
awareness of the community. The committee was made aware of this, when
visiting different provinces to check on their working conditions. That is
how the Department of Labour enforced the provision of jobs - it delegated
this to the provinces to create jobs immediately.]

The department has done so much, in so little time in terms of service
delivery, despite the distorted, misleading labour market framework that we
inherited. It has succeeded in delivery on the promise of a new labour
dispensation that helps to entrench the rights of ordinary people and lays
the foundation for sustainable economic growth.

with the help of the public as a whole. We are endeavouring to achieve
change through good service. The ANC says this budget should be accepted.
[Applause.]]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, I would like to advise the hon Minister to put on
his crash helmet before I start my speech. [Laughter.]
Ek wil in hierdie arbeidsdebat vandag op een aspek fokus, naamlik dit wat
by ons mense al bekend geword het as onregstellende aksie. U moet my vandag
verskoon as ek in rasseterme praat. Ek wil nie, maar die arbeidswette dwing
my daartoe. Dit is die Wet op Gelyke Indiensneming wat rasseklassifikasie
voortsit en waarvolgens werkers ingedeel word in terme van wit en swart en
dan teen eersgenoemde diskrimineer. Ondernemings met minder as 50 werkers
word van hierdie wet vrygestel. Gaan die wet op gelykheid op hulle
losgelaat word? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In this labour debate today I want to focus on one aspect, namely what has
become known among our people as ``onregstellende aksie'' [non-affirmative
action]. You must forgive me today if I speak in racial terms. I do not
want to, but the labour laws force me to do so. It is the Employment Equity
Act which proceeds with race classification and according to which workers
are divided in terms of white and black and the former are then
discriminated against. Enterprises with fewer than 50 workers are exempt
from this Act. Is the Act dealing with equality going to be unleashed upon
them?]

The hon President stated in his state of the nation address in February
2000 that our labour laws have unforeseen consequences and should be
addressed. Up to now nothing substantial has been addressed. Let me spell
out one of these unforeseen consequences.

Hierdie wet stel as einddoel dat die bevolkingssamestelling in die werkplek
weerspieël moet word. Dit klink mooi edel, maar in eenvoudige somme beteken
dit dat 'n miljoen wittes uit die werkplek verwyder moet word. Uit 24% wit
werkers, sowat 12% van die bevolking, moet een in die slag bly; te meer
omdat nie-werkbare sosialistiese wetgewing, misdaad en openbare flaters van
die regering, ekonomiese groei inhibeer en sorg dat die koek nie groter
word nie, maar eerder kleiner opgesny word.

Maatskappye moet nou regstellende planne opstel, om by hierdie teikens uit
te kom. Ondernemings kan nie net deur natuurlike personeelomset hierdie
teikens bereik nie en wend hulle tot onkonvensionele metodes. Die gevolg is
vervreemding en frustrasie. Een tipiese voorbeeld is Eskom. Hier maak ek
met dank gebruik van gegewens verskaf deur mnr Dirk Hermann van MBI
Solidariteit. Eskom het meer as R800 miljoen bestee om van witmense ontslae
te raak. Uit dokumente blyk dit dat 'n verdere R182 miljoen daarvoor op pad
is. Hierdie bedrag verteenwoordig 3000 blankes in die middel- en
bestuurslynposte. Dit het miljoene rande gekos om hulle op te lei, miljoene
om van hulle ontslae te raak en miljoene om ander weer in hulle plek aan te
stel.

Ons bekommernis is dat ondernemings regstellende aksie sien as niks anders
as rassetransformasie nie. Dit is nie gelykheid, maar nuwe ongelykhede.
Daarom wil ek vra dat daar indringend na die volgende gekyk word: Daar moet
'n definitiewe eindpunt aan regstellende aksie gekoppel word, naamlik 'n
sogenaamde ``sunset clause''. Jongmense wat vir die eerste keer die
arbeidsmark betree, moet hiervan vrygestel word. Indien regstellende aksie
op bestuursvlakke toegepas word, moet dit ook op die onderste vlakke
toegepas word, waar blankes onderverteenwoordig is.
Alternatiewe moet geskep word vir mense wat benadeel word deur middel van
opleiding, ontwikkeling of alternatiewe projekte. 'n Spesiale kode moet
opgestel word om nuwe rassisme te keer. Die regering moet streng optree
indien ondernemings nuwe vorme van rassediskriminasie skep. 'n Wetwysiging
is nodig om te verseker dat Suid-Afrikaners nie benadeel word ten gunste
van buitelanders in die regstellende aksieproses nie. Hier dink ek veral
aan Kubane. Werkgewers moet in hul verslae aan die Departement van Arbeid
aandui watter maatreels in plek gestel gaan word, om te verhoed dat nuwe
diskriminasie benadeling skep. Doen ons dit nie, gaan blankes verder
vervreem raak. Rassespanning in die werkplek gaan verhoog, 'n nuwe
geskoolde werkloosheidspoel gaan ontstaan en die emigrasiestroom gaan
eenvoudig toeneem.

Ek wil die ANC-regering vandag goeie raad gee: doen net drie dinge - bekamp
misdaad en veral plaasmoorde, staak die verdringing van ons taal en maak 'n
einde aan regstellende aksie. Die ANC sal verbaas wees oor hoeveel
positiewe energie onder my mense geskep gaan word. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is
goeie raad. Of die Regering dit gaan aanvaar, is sy saak. [Tussenwerpsels.]

'n AGB LID: Wie is jou mense?

Mnr C AUCAMP: As agb lede nou nog nie weet nie ... [Gelag.] (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This Act has as its object that the population composition should be
reflected in the workplace. This sounds very noble, but in simple
arithmetic it means that one million whites must be removed from the
workplace. Out of 24% white workers, approximately 12% of the population,
one must be removed; more so because unworkable socialistic legislation,
crime and public blunders on the part of the Government are inhibiting
economic growth and ensuring that the cake is not getting bigger, but is
being cut into smaller pieces instead.

Companies now have to draft affirmative plans, in order to reach these
targets. Enterprises cannot simply reach these targets by way of natural
staff turnover and are resorting to unconventional methods. The result is
alienation and frustration. A typical example of this is Eskom. Here I am
gratefully making use of figures provided by Mr Dirk Hermann from MBI
Solidarity. Eskom spent more than R800 million to get rid of white people.
It is apparent from documentation that a further R182 million for this
purpose is on its way. This amount represents 3 000 whites in middle and
management posts. It cost millions of rand to train them, millions to get
rid of them and millions to appoint others in their place.

Our concern is that enterprises view affirmative action as nothing more
than racial transformation. It is not equality, but new inequality. I
therefore want to ask that the following be looked at urgently: a definite
end point must be linked to affirmative action, namely a so-called sunset
clause. Young people entering the labour market for the first time must be
exempt from this. If affirmative action is to be implemented at management
level, it must also be implemented at the lowest levels where whites are
underrepresented.

Alternatives must be created for people who are negatively affected by way
of training, development or alternative projects. A special code must be
drafted to prevent new racism. The Government must act strongly if
enterprises create new forms of racial discrimination. A statutory
amendment is necessary to ensure that South Africans are not disadvantaged
in favour of foreigners in the affirmative action process. In this regard I
am thinking about Cubans in particular. Employers must indicate in their
reports to the Department of Labour what measures are going to be put in
place to prevent disadvantages being created by new discrimination. If we
do not do this, whites are going to become further alienated. Racial
tension in the workplace will increase, a new skilled pool of unemployed
people is going to arise and the stream of emigrants is simply going to
increase.

Today I want to give the ANC Government good advice: do just three things -
combat crime and farm murders in particular, stop the suppression of our
language and put an end to affirmative action. The ANC will be amazed at
how much positive energy will be created among my people. [Interjections.]
This is good advice. Whether the Government is going to take it, is their
business. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Who are your people?

Mr C AUCAMP: If hon members still do not know ... [Laughter.]]

Mr S PILLAY: Chairperson, the unemployment rate in South Africa is often a
matter of diverse opinion. Reports and research put the unemployment
percentage at anything between 33% and 62%. Whatever the percentage is, it
is far too high.

Some of the consequences of unemployment include the breakdown of family
life and values; an inability to pay rent, electricity and other basic
services; an extremely high rate of school dropouts, even at primary school
levels; and increased and uncontrollable levels of crime, frustration,
anger and feelings of hopelessness.

I shall mention two other factors, and focus on some social and political
causes of unemployment in South Africa, namely a lack of finance, coupled
with a burdensome process of registering a company or closed corporation,
and a lack of business management training or access thereto.

President Robert Mugabe and his campaign of terror caused thousands of
Zimbabweans to flee Zimbabwe and enter South Africa, joining the ranks of
the unemployed. Over 1,1 million people have fled Zimbabwe, entering
Botswana, South Africa and other countries. A recent survey in which I was
involved, that covered Joubert Park, Hillbrow, Bellevue, Berea and
Rosettenville, showed that of the 44 blocks of flats surveyed, 50%, that is
22 of the blocks of flats, were fully occupied by unemployed Zimbabweans
that have fled from Robert Mugabe's campaign of terror. The flats
accommodated 33 912 people. In a three-bedroomed flat there were 12 people,
that is four people per room, living under the most appalling conditions.
[Interjections.] If everything were in order, why would people choose to
live under such terrible conditions? Sources within the Zimbabwean
community indicate that there are more than 500 000 Zimbabwean nationals
living in South Africa at present.

All of the respondents interviewed indicated that they had no visible means
of support, were unemployed in Zimbabwe and looking for employment in South
Africa, had fled from Robert Mugabe's campaign of terror, and that they had
entered South Africa illegally or as visitors and had been in South Africa
for more than two years. [Interjections.] These people are unemployed and
while they seek employment, they have to obtain accommodation, eat, travel,
communicate and receive medical treatment. As they have no visible means of
support, the question arises as to how and where they manage to obtain the
means to live.

We have a strange and unacceptable situation to manage. The Zimbabweans,
like others that enter the country illegally, do so at the borders where
they are not controlled. The Minister of Safety and Security referred a
question in that regard to the Minister of Defence. The Minister of
Defence, in turn, referred the matter to the Minister of Home Affairs.
Someone has to tell this House what arrangements the Minister of Foreign
Affairs has made with Robert Mugabe that prevent her from reacting strongly
to the social invasion of South Africa by Robert Mugabe. [Interjections.]

Robert Mugabe has blamed everyone except God for the devastation that has
been wreaked on that country. It is only a matter of time before he
includes the Almighty as a murderousÿ ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order, Mr Pillay. Mr Goniwe?

Mr M T GONIWE: Chairperson, I want to know whether the member is reading
the correct speech? [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, continue, but keep to the
debate.

Mr S PILLAY: It is only a matter of time before he includes the Almighty as
a murderous, colonial criminal.
However, the flood of people that enter South Africa point to one man and
his violent economic practices. These practices have resulted in the
displacement and death of thousands of innocent citizens. Someone in
Zimbabwe is responsible for the reign of terror, starvation, crime and
unemployment that is causing such a huge exodus of people from their homes
in the land of their birth and their entering South Africa, hence
exacerbating the level of unemployment. [Interjections.] I submit ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order, Mr Pillay. There is another
point of order.

Ms N E HANGANA: Chairperson, on a point of order: This is just for the
information of the member. We do have a Minister of Foreign Affairs in this
House.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, just stick to the Vote on
Labour. Continue with your speech. [Laughter.]

Mr S PILLAY: Chairperson, I submit that the culprit in this case is Robert
Mugabe. [Interjections.] The question remains unanswered as to which
Minister is responsible for guarding our borders and ensuring that those
who should be allowed to enter the country do so unhindered, and those who
are not supposed to enter and remain here are apprehended if they attempt
to do so. Whatever the reasons that the Ministers are unable to answer the
questions or take the necessary action, this indicates that they are inept
or deliberately causing confusion to increase unemployment, as hundreds of
people are entering the country illegally on a daily basis.

We cannot expect the hon the Minister to provide us with accurate
information as to how many people in South Africa are unemployed, as no one
in Government is able to tell us how many illegal immigrants are in the
country because they have fraudulently obtained South African identity
documents. The SA Broadcasting Corporation employed such people. In that
context, I am not surprised. I submit that the hon Minister's colleagues
are rendering him unable to do his work.

Robert Mugabe has ANC written all over him. [Interjections.] He is the ANC
that does not stand for African National Congress. He, together with the
ruling party here, gives a new meaning to ANC, and that is ``Another
National Calamity''.

Mr M T GONIWE: Chairperson, on a point of order: I appeal that this member
be ruled out of order. He is wasting the House's time ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I cannot rule the speech of the
member out of order, but I am advising hon members to stick to the Vote
being discussed today. Continue, Mr Pillay, and stick to the Vote being
discussed today.

Mr S PILLAY: Chairperson, what I am saying here is that the violence and
economic practices of Robert Mugabe are causing more unemployment in this
country, and that is in line with the Vote. [Interjections.] The Minister
of Safety ...

Mr M RAMGOBIN: Chairperson, on a point of order: Can the speaker tell us
whether the DP has a labour desk?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I do not know whether the member
would like to take a question. Do you want to take a question, hon Pillay?
[Interjections.] He does not want to take a question. Continue with your
speech, hon member.

Mr S PILLAY: Chairperson, there are over 500 000 unemployed Zimbabweans in
this country, and they are adding to the problem of unemployment that we
are confronted with. [Interjections.] That is actually at the heart of the
matter here. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr S A MSHUDULU: Mhlalingaphambili, kuyacaca ukuba ngumbutho we-ANC kuphela
ozaziyo iimfuno zabasebenzi. [Chairperson, it is clear that it is only the
ANC that knows the needs of the workers.]

I hope that the hon President will share with us in this debate even in his
absence. Hon Minister of Labour, hon members of this House, distinguished
guests, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to participate in this budget debate
today on behalf of the ANC with regard to the policy framework put in place
by the ANC-led Government to transform our labour market and how it is
progressing towards addressing past imbalances. I further wish to outline
what institutional changes were put in place to allow a smooth
implementation of these policies and to transform our labour market and our
industrial and economic environment so that we find a place in the global
world.

We need a strategy that will allow us to achieve this objective. Before I
unpack what strategy has been put in place to address the imbalances of the
past, let me give this House the background to the country's past
distortions in the labour market in IsiXhosa, so that even workers out
there who cannot understand English can hear me.

Mawethu, nani zinkosi zam, kubalulekile ukuba siqale ngokuchaza ukuba
sivela phi na singabasebenzi, ukuze sazi ukuba simi phi okanye siya phi na.

Kwithuba langaphambili likarhulumente we-NP, abasebenzi, ngakumbi abamnyama
ngebala, babengaphethwanga ngambeko. Kubasebenzi ababhinqileyo
nabakhubazekileyo kwakunzima ukuqeshwa, yeka kona ukuphathwa gadalala
emisebenzini xa bathe abavuma ukwenza ezinye izinto ukuze bamkeleke.

Kwabo basebenzi babekhe basebenza emigodini okanye kumaziko-mveliso,
sokhumbula okokuba ngalaa mhla wokuqala bathabatha ijoyini okanye belindele
ukuqeshwa kwakufuneka ukuba baqale bakhulule babe ze ukulungiselela ukuba
ugqirha abaxilonge okanye abajonge ukuba bacoceke kangakanani na. Lo gqirha
wayengayikhathalelanga into yokuba babelingana ngeminyaka kusini na. Xa
ebonana nalowo uqeshwayo bekufanele aphendule nemibuzo enganxulumananga
naloo msebenzi awufunayo. Umzekelo, kwakubuzwa ukuba wawukhe waqeqeshelwa
ubujoni na okanye uyasazi na isiBhulu.

Zizo zonke ezi zinto ndithetha ngazo Mhlalingaphambili, ezazibangela ukuba
abantu abamnyama abafuna umsebenzi bangaqeshwa, kulungiselelwa abebala.
Ngenxa yale ngxaki, Mhlalingaphambili, ndiyathemba ukuba uza kuvumelana nam
xa ndisithi abanye abakhanyayo ngebala kuthi bagqibela sele beziguqulele
esilungwini iifani zabo.

Olo calu-calulo lwalunzima nangaphakathi kwiindawo zokusebenza ngoba
nangani wawungesiso isidenge wawunokugugela engqeshweni ungumenzi weti,
ungenakho ukunyuselwa ukuze wenze omnye umsebenzi owandisa ulwazi lwakho
khon' ukuze wamkele imali eyoneleyo. Abasebenzi ababhinqileyo
kwakungafanelekanga ukuba bamkele imali elinganayo neyamadoda noxa
besebenza ngokufanayo.

Yiyo yonke le nkohlakalo engqeshweni nasekuhlaleni enyanzele ukuba bonke
abasebenzi bavotele i-ANC eyayikhokelwa nguMongameli uThambo nguTat'
uMandela, ngoku, nguMongameli Mbeki, ngenxa yokuba yiyo yodwa eyayinakho
ukubakhupha ebukhobokeni.

Ngoko ke uthi umbuzo: Kungokuba i-ANC iphethe ntoni na esandleni?
Kwasekuqaleni, ngo-1912, i-ANC yayineembono zokulwa ingcinezelo,
ubukhoboka, indlala nazo zonke izinto ezazisenziwa ngurhulumente we-NP,
ngakumbi kwiimeko apho yayisehlisa isidima sabantu abamnyama. Eminye
imizekelo kukwanda kwabantu abangasebenziyo, nenani eliphezulu labasebenzi
abangasetyenziswa ngendlela efanelekileyo.

Ukwanda kwendlala kubangelwa kukubhatalwa kwabantu abamnyama imivuzo
engaphantsi kwaleyo yabamhlophe kodwa besebenza imisebenzi efanayo okanye
elinganayo ngokubaluleka, ukungalingani ngokwempatho kwiindawo
zokusebenzela, ukuyisebenzisela uqeqesho lwabamhlophe bodwa imali yengeniso
ebisetyenzelwe ngabo bonke abasebenzi, ukungahlonitshwa, ngabaqeshi,
kwemithetho ekhusela bonke abasebenzi nokungakhuselwa kwabo basebenzi
abangakwaziyo ukuzithethelela. Ndithetha ngabasebenzi basezifama,
abasemakhitshini nabakwiindawo ezincinci zokusebenzela. (Translation of
Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Hon people, it is important that we begin by explaining where we come from
as workers, so that we can know where we stand at the moment and where we
are going.

During the period of the government of the NP, workers, particularly the
black workers, were not treated with respect. It was difficult for women
and the disabled to get employment. They were faced with intimidation at
places of employment if they did not agree to engage in some activities,
which would guarantee their acceptance.

We should remember that on the first day of employment or whilst awaiting
acceptance, the people who used to work in the mines or factories had to
remove all their clothes and be naked so that a doctor could examine them
or check their hygienic condition. This particular doctor did not care
whether these people were of the same age or not. When he was being
examined, the one who was to be employed had to answer questions that were
not even relevant to the type of job that he was going to be doing. For
instance, he would be asked whether he had ever trained to be a soldier or
whether he knew how to speak Afrikaans.

These are all the things that prohibited black people from being employed,
as jobs were reserved for ``Coloured'' people, Chairperson. Because of this
problem, Chairperson, I hope that you will agree with me when I say that
some of us who happened to have a fair colouring or lighter skin ended up
changing our surnames to be like those of white people.

This kind of discrimination was even strongly felt when one was already
employed, because even though one was not stupid, one could reach
retirement age without ever having been promoted to a position or kind of
job that would develop one so that one could earn enough; if one was making
tea, one would remain a tea-maker. It was considered inappropriate for
women to earn the same salary as men, even though they were doing the same
kind of job.

It was this cruelty in places of employment that caused workers to vote for
the ANC that was led by the late President Tambo, hon Mr Mandela, and now,
President Mbeki. It was because it was the only party that could save them
from slavery.

The question then arises: What can the ANC offer? Since its establishment
in 1912, the ANC had a vision to fight oppression, slavery, starvation and
all the other bad things that the former NP government did, particularly in
situations where it degraded black people. Other examples are the rise in
unemployment and the rise in the number of workers that are in jobs that
are not suitable for them.

The rise in poverty levels is a direct result of inadequate payments made
to black workers that is actually less than that of their white
counterparts while doing the same kind of jobs; inequality in places of
employment; the training of white people with money that all the workers
worked to generate; disrespect of the laws protecting all workers by
employers and the lack of protection for workers that are not able to speak
for themselves. I am talking about farm workers, domestic workers and
workers in emerging businesses.]

Chairperson, it is against this background that the policies of the ANC-led
Government had to be tailored so as to address these frustrations and
imbalances of the past. It was for this reason that sections 2, 9 and 23 of
our Constitution and the whole Bill of Rights were included in order to
bring about legislative reforms.

These sections of our Constitution have given birth to the Labour Relations
Act, more especially, Chapter VII, ie the Code of Good Practice regarding
dismissals, the Employment Equity Act, the Skills Development Act and the
Basic Conditions of Employment Act. The desire to entrench democracy
through institutional reform has also led to the establishment of the CCMA,
Nedlac and the Commission for Employment Equity.

The Constitution and the Public Finance Management Act require of the
Department of Labour, in this instance, that it reflects on the outcomes-
based programme to see how this financial year's and future allocations, in
the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, are going to be spent. All these
progressive policies are put in place for the sake of accountability,
because the ANC is on course, as the President said.

This is value for money, and beneficiaries who are taxpayers need to know
what the Government they have voted into power spends money on and how it
addresses their needs. To this end, let me first take this House through
the employment equity programme. With regard to the implementation of the
Employment Equity Act, the pragmatic ANC-led Government first had to adopt
a phased-in approach so as to take everyone on board. The Department of
Labour had first to establish a directorate of employment equity to
administer this legislation aimed at eliminating unfair discrimination in
employment and ensuring successful implementation of the Employment Equity
Act, to redress the effects of discrimination in the workplace.
Furthermore, the department established the Commission for Employment
Equity whose duty it is to give advice to the Minister on policy matters,
including the issuing of codes of good practice. It further identifies
areas of research.

In the past financial year the department has complied with the
requirements of section 41 of the Employment Equity Act through the
establishment of an employment registry called the public registry, which
was gazetted on 2 October. It has succeeded in registering 3 083 employer
organisations, which is 60% of the total employers. But by December the
number had gone up to 4 152, which is 89% of employers who complied with
the Act. All these figures, as well as these achievements, happened because
of the role that was played by Nedlac, a forum in which all parties
participated and made contributions, although some claim not to have played
a role.

Kubalulekile ke ukuba abasebenzi phaya ngaphandle bazi ukuba eyona ndlela
yokwenza amazwi ukuba abo avakale, kukugqithisela izimvo zabo kwi-Nedlac,
ukwenzela ukuba kuthi xa imithetho ifikelela apha ePalamente babe nabo sele
belenzile igalelo.

I-ANC iyalwamkela olu hlahlo lwabiwo-mali kuba intetho yoMphathiswa
iyicacisile into yokuba i-ANC isemgaqeweni, yaye akukho ndlela yokuba
ingaxokisa ilizwe. (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[It is important for the workers to know that in order for their voices to
be heard, they should forward their views to Nedlac, so that when Bills are
tabled in Parliament, their views would be included in them.

The ANC welcomes this budget because the Minister's speech showed clearly
that the ANC is on the right track and that there is no way that it can
mislead the country.]

UMPHATHISWA WEZABASEBENZI: Mhlalingaphambili, okokuqala mandibulele onke
amalungu athe athabatha inxaxheba kule ngxoxo-mpikiswano.

Okwesibini mandiwabulele amalungu ngokusebenzisa iilwimi zawo zeenkobe.
Ngokwenza njalo amalungu adala amathuba emisebenzi. Ukudala nokuvula
amathuba emisebenzi asikokucikoza kuphela, kufuneka senze. Siyakuthi senze
ngokuthi sisebenzise iilwimi zethu xa sithetha, ukwenzela ukuba abaa bantu
batolikayo bafumane ukutya nabo. Baya kutya ke ngokuthi sizisebenzise
iilwimi zethu. Xa ke amalungu ezoyika yaye ezonyanya iilwimi zawo, abantu
nabo baza kungakufumani ukutya.

Ndiyabulela kakhulu kumalungu athe asixhasa. Bakhona ke noko ekufuneka
ndikhe ndithi nje gqwathu gqwathu kubo, ndibathi mpaka mpaka ke noko,
ndingabashiyi beseloluya hlobo bebeze belulo apha eqongeni. [Kwahlekwa.]

Ndiyabulela kakhulu kuMnu Middleton ngokusixhasa kwakhe nangokuwuqonda
kwakhe umsebenzi esiwuphetheyo noxanduva esijongene nalo sileli Sebe.
Ndibamba ngazibini kwindod'enkulu. Bendiyazi kakade into yokuba iza
kusixhasa yona.

Ndifuna ukusebenzisa ifani le yakhe imnandi, ithetha ngokubhlasa, ndikhe
ndimbhlase kwezinye iindawo. [Kwahlekwa.] Siyavumelana naye uMnu Blaas
ukuba ngokwenene kwi-UIF le ikhona ingxaki. Kodwa into uMnu Blaas
ayilibalayo malunga ne-UIF yeyokuba, nanjengomntu owakhe wakulo eli Sebe,
ukuba iinkcukacha zam zezichanekileyo, kukuba umele ukuba agxeke umthetho
wakhe we-NP ka-1966 we-UIF.
Unyaka ka-1966 ngulowo kwabhubha ngawo umhlekazi uVelevutha phaya kulaa
Ndlu ikweliya cala. Ngunyaka omdala kakhulu ke lowo, u-1966. Ngulo nyaka
ndafika ngawo apha eKapa ke mna, u-1966.

Makayazi into yokuba into ebangela ukuba size nomthetho omtsha kukufuna
ukususa onke amanyundululu, intshela namanyala abo beyi -NP. Ezinye ke
iingxaki esinazo kwi-UIF zibangelwe nguye nabantu awayesebenza nabo apha.
Naye uyayibona iminyaka le yakhe ukuba iyangqina ukuba ngokwenene wayekho
ngelaa xesha kwakusenziwa eli nyundululu.] Silungisa loo nto ke, mhlekazi.
Zizinto, ezi, ezenziwa ngabo. Basishiya nale meko. Simele ke ngoko ukuba
sibe nezinto esizenzayo.

UMnu Ramodike ndiyambulela kakhulu. Kambe ke imibuzo ayibuzayo, ebhekisele
ikakhulu kwezobugcisa, ndingavuya ukuba unokuyizisa njengemibuzo ukwenzela
ukuba sikwazi ukuyiphendula. [Oo`how many' aba ababubazayo apha, Senzela
ukuba nyhani sibaphendule, kuba ndiyaqonda ukuba kuza kunyanzeleka
simphendule.] Imibuzo yakhe inondileko kakhulu. (Translation of Xhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Chairperson, firstly, I would like to thank all
the hon members that participated in this debate.

Secondly, I would like to thank the hon members for using their first
languages. By doing so they create job opportunities. Creating and opening
up job opportunities is not only about talking about them, but it is about
actions. That we will accomplish by speaking our first languages, so that
the interpreters can also earn a living. They will be able to feed
themselves when we use our languages. When hon members are afraid to use
their languages and despise them, people will not be able to earn a living.

I am very grateful to the hon members who supported us. However, I feel I
should throw some pebbles of truth between the eyes of some members, lest
they remain what they were before they came to the podium. [Laughter.]

I am very grateful to Mr Middleton for supporting us and for his
understanding of the work that we are handling and the responsibility we
have as this department. I am really grateful to the old man. I knew that
he would definitely support us.
However, I would like to use his nice sounding surname that seems to be
about blasting, and blast him a little. [Laughter.] We agree with Mr Blaas
that really there is a problem with the UIF. However, what Mr Blaas forgets
about the UIF, is that as a person who once was in this department, if the
information I have is accurate, he is supposed to criticise the UIF law of
1966 that was passed by the NP.

The year 1966 is the year in which Dr Verwoerd died in the House on the
other side. It is a long time ago. The same year, 1966, is the year in
which I came to Cape Town for the first time.

He should know that the reason we introduced a new law is that we wanted to
erase all the bad and immoral things that they did as the NP. Some of the
problems we are experiencing with the UIF were caused by him and the people
he worked with here. He himself can actually see by his age that he was
there when these vices were committed. We are correcting exactly that now,
Sir. These are things that were committed by them. They left us in this bad
situation. We are, therefore, obliged to do something about it.

I would like to thank Mr Ramodike very much. His questions, though, are
more directed to technology and I would be glad if he could present them as
written questions so that we can be in a position to answer them. We are
going to have to answer the questions he is posing regarding statistical
figures. His questions are very valuable.]

In his opinion article on Wednesday in the Cape Times, the leader of the
DA, the hon Tony Leon, said that unemployment was very high and that the
major reason for this was the labour laws introduced by the ANC.
[Interjections.] While no one can deny the fact that our country has a high
unemployment rate, it is spurious to attribute this to laws passed since
1994. [Interjections.] The truth of the matter is that the high
unemployment rate is a direct legacy of the apartheid-style economy which
had inherent rigidities and inefficiencies. [Interjections.]

The mess created by hon Leon's political alliance partner, the NP, began
showing cracks in the 1980s when the spate of job losses continued
unabated. What we see today is the aggregation of many decades of ill-
conceived, poorly conceptualised and ill-fated policies of apartheid that
cannot be blamed on the ANC. Hon Leon continues to say, in the said
article:


  Our highly protective and intrusive labour laws are pushing the cost of
  labour to unacceptable levels, frightening employers from taking on
  labour, discouraging new businesses from starting up and deterring
  investment.

This statement only serves to confirm what many of us can no longer afford
to ignore, namely that he lives in a world of his own - ilizwe leempundulu
[a world of fantasy]. In that fictitious world facts and reality are
substituted for figments of the imagination. An institution no less
honourable and independent than the Reserve Bank proves the hon Leon's
assertion to be far from the truth. On page 15 of the Reserve Bank's
Monetary Policy Review of March 2001, the following is stated, and I
quote.:


  Annual growth in labour productivity in the nonagricultural sectors
  increased from 2,6% in the first quarter of 1999 to 6,3% in the second
  quarter of 2000. Given the fairly moderate increases in nominal
  remuneration per worker in this period, this improvement in labour
  productivity resulted in the inflationary pressures associated with unit
  labour costs falling sharply. As a result, pressures on inflation,
  emanating from the labour market, have been subdued.

In the light of the Reserve Bank dictum, and other related overwhelming and
cogent evidence that dispel the hon Leon's ill-conceived accusations, one
wonders what Mr Leon's hidden agenda is. [Interjections.] One wonders why
Mr Leon is so determined to mislead the South African public on this
matter. [Interjections.] I call on Mr Leon to stop insulting the
intelligence of the South African public by making spurious, reckless
allegations in the hope of scoring cheap political points.

Ndifuna ukuvala ngoMnu Groenewald noMnu Aucamp. Asijiki nokuba sekumnyama
entla. Siya phambili.

Bendimele ukuba ndiqale phaya kuPillay. Makhe ndiqale ngaye. [Kwahlekwa.]
Mna ndicinga ukuba sikhona isigulo anaso uMnu Pillay [Kwahlekwa.]
Sisinyhola sesiqihela, sesihiba, sesi-aha-aha esingafuni kulandelwa.
[Kwahlekwa.]

KuMnu Groenewald nakuMnu Aucamp ndithi: Asijiki nokuba sekumnyama entla.
Siya phambili. Bayakhala abo basivotelayo siyiNkongolo. Bathi lusengamandla
ucalu-calulo apho basebenza khona. Lo Mthetho ungoLingano eNgqeshweni
sisixhobo nesikhali sokulwa ucalu-calulo eliyinxalenye yalo ilungu
elihloniphekileyo. Ilungu lityebe liteketeke nje kukunyiba amanqatha olwaa
calu-calulo lwalukho ngaphambili. [Uwele-wele.]

Iintetho zikaMnu Groenewald zinokudala unxunguphalo nempixano. Abo
basivotelayo banomsindo. Sibabambile siyiNkongolo. Ilungu eli
liyabaxhokonxa. Liza kudliwa bubugqwangu ke, kuba likhala lingekabethwa.
Asikabethi mntu thina, kodwa sele ekhala. Kanti ke sithi abantu abanesikofu
nabakhuthuke intamo yidyokhwe yengcinezelo. [Uwele-wele.]

Bazivele abantu bakowethu ukuba sisekude engqinibeni. Sinqumla entlango,
ookrebe abafana noGroenewald bayasing'ong'ozela, bayasixhokonxa. Mna ke
icebiso lam lithi: Mabangaqhwanyazi. Mabeme bathi ngxi. Mabaqinise
iziquluba, baqule baligangathe. Eli dabi lokulwa ingcinezelo ngumlo omkhulu
oza kubangela ukuba kutak' iintlantsi negazi ukuba bathe baqhwanyaza.

Masilonyanye ucalu-calulo. Masitshice sithi: Phantsi ngocalucalulo!

AMALUNGU AHLONIPHEKILEYO: Phantsi! [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[Finally, I would like to address the hon Mr Groenewald and the hon Mr
Aucamp. For us, there is no turning back, no matter what lies ahead. We are
going forward.

I should have addressed the hon Mr Pillay first. Let me start with him.
[Laughter.] I think that the hon Mr Pillay suffers from a certain illness.
He displays signs of being a simple-minded person who should not be paid
attention to by anyone. [Laughter.]

To Mr Groenewald and Mr Aucamp I say: For us, there is no turning back, no
matter what lies ahead. We are going forward. Those that voted for us, as
the ANC, are complaining. They say that discrimination is still very rife
in their places of employment. The Employment Equity Act is a weapon for
fighting discrimination and the hon member was part of the process that
passed it. The hon member is so fat from the proceeds of apartheid that
existed before. [Interjections.]

Mr Groenewald's speeches can cause despondency and strife. Those that voted
for us are angry. We are trying to calm them as the ANC. The hon member now
is provoking them. He brings the hornet's nest close to his ear, but he
screams before he is stung. He will get what he is asking for. He has not
been stung yet, but already he is screaming. We are the ones who endured
pain, who were bartered and who bear the scars of suffering under the yoke
of oppression. [Interjections.]

Our people can tell for themselves that we are still far from achieving our
goals. We are crossing a desert; on the way there are wolves like Mr
Groenewald who are baying for our blood; they are provoking us. My advice
is: They should not blink. They should stand still. They should stand firm
and be well prepared. This battle against oppression is a serious one and
it is going to cause sparks to fly and blood to flow, if they blink.

Let us despise discrimination. As a sign of our aversion to it, let us spit
on it and say: Down with discrimination!

HON MEMBERS: Down! [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 12:03.
