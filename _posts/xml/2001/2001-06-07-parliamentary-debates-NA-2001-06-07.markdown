lokuhlala kwale Ndlu ngizophakamisa egameni likaKhongolose:


  Ukuthi le Ndlu -

       ngokuthi ihloniphe ngeziqu omunye wabaholi abangasekho;

[Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu notice of motion follows.)

[Miss M N BUTHELEZI: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the University of Zululand on breaking the record in
       South Africa by honouring one of the late leaders;


  (2) congratulates inkosi Albert Luthuli, who was the president of the ANC
       and the first person in Africa to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, and
       who will be receiving an honorary doctorate on Saturday, 9 June 2001,
       in the Durban City Hall; and


  (3) challenges other tertiary institutions to follow in these footsteps
       in bringing back the ubuntu, stability and humility of Africa.

[Applause.]]

Mr E K MOORCROFT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House, mindful of the importance of the Earth Summit to be
  held in Johannesburg in 2002 -


  (1) recognises that the eyes of the world will be focused on South Africa
       at this time;


  (2) notes with alarm persistent media reports that the available funding
       for this massive operation currently falls far short of what is
       required to make the summit a success, viz that of an estimated R400
       million which will be needed, only some R100 million has been
       committed to date; and
  (3) therefore urges the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism to
       dispel these rumours and to take all necessary steps to ensure that
       the Earth Summit is a success and brings credit to South Africa.

Prince N E ZULU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Almighty has allowed his nature to play to the benefit
       of His people in that the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board has witnessed
       another annual sardine migration from the mouth of the Umtamvuna
       River and over a stretch of land to Port Edward;


  (2) appreciates the fact that the said Sharks Board is alerting the
       public about the sardine run so that even the needy can feed their
       families in this season; and


  (3) calls upon all and sundry to safeguard nature for sustainable
       development so that such a marine heritage does not deplete.

Mr R J B MOHLALA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Public Protector, Mr Selby Baqwa, has asked Parliament
       for protection against improper and unwarranted attacks made against
       him and his office by Members of Parliament, particularly those from
       the PAC;


  (2) further notes that the Office of the Public Protector is a
       constitutional structure that reports to Parliament and that
       unwarranted attacks by MPs constitute a breach of parliamentary
       Rules;


  (3) believes that these attacks are not only aimed at undermining the
       credibility of these section 9 structures, but are also a deliberate
       and wilful assault on our democracy; and


  (4) therefore urges the Public Protector to consider making a formal
       complaint to Parliament so that appropriate action can be taken
       against MPs responsible for this irresponsible behaviour.

[Applause.]

Dr S J GOUS: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis kennis neem dat -


  (1) die uitwerking van MIV/Vigs op die Departement van Onderwys reeds
       teen 2006 rampspoedige gevolge kan hê vir beide leerlinge en
       onderwysers;


  (2) volgens verslae die getal leerlinge per onderwyser van 34 tot 50 kan
       vermeerder in die jaar 2006 en 'n geraamde 300 000 leerlinge binne
       die volgende 10 jaar weens MIV/Vigs kan sterf;


  (3) die DA steeds glo dat voldoende onderrig oor MIV/Vigs die beste
       manier is om die Vigs pandemie aan te pak en verder kennis neem dat
       die Wes-Kaapse onderwysdepartement die voortou geneem het om
       programme in skole te implementeer wat leerlinge en onderwysers inlig
       oor die MIV/Vigs pandemie; en


  (4) die verantwoordelikheid by die Departement van Onderwys lê om dié
       kritieke uitdagings aan te pak en seker te maak dat onderwys nie deur
       MIV/Vigs lamgelê word nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the new NP:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) the impact of HIV/Aids on the Department of Education could by 2006
       already have disastrous consequences for both pupils and teachers;


  (2) according to reports the number of pupils per teacher could increase
       from 34 to 50 by the year 2006 and within the next 10 years an
       estimated 300 000 pupils could die from HIV/Aids;


  (3) the DA still believes that sufficient education about HIV/Aids is the
       best way to tackle this pandemic and further notes that the Western
       Cape's education department has taken the lead in implementing
       programmes at schools which inform pupils and teachers about the
       HIV/Aids pandemic; and


  (4) the Department of Education has the responsibility to address these
       critical challenges and ensure that education is not paralysed by
       HIV/Aids.]

Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its concern at the threat posed by HIV/Aids to education
       and the predicted increase by 2006 to 50 pupils per teacher;


  (2) acknowledges that other HIV/Aids-related factors are illness and
       death, an increase in orphans and a lack of hope, thereby
       perpetuating dropout rates;


  (3) notes that poverty, psychological and psychiatric trauma as well as
       treatment costs exacerbate this gloomy forecast; and


  (4) calls on the Minister of Education to urgently put contingency plans
       into action to adequately deal with this threat that has both social
       and economic implications.

Mr M M MASALA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister of Safety and Security, Steve Tshwete, and
       the Minister of Defence, Mosiuoa Lekota, visited Manenberg yesterday;


  (2) further notes that the Ministers announced plans to tackle the
       problem of gangsterism in Manenberg, Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha;


  (3) believes that the elaborate plans announced by the Ministers reflect
       a commitment by the ANC Government to provide safety and security to
       all communities; and
  (4) welcomes these plans and calls on communities to work with the police
       to bring criminals to book.

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that the Department of Justice yesterday opened six new high
           courts and judges chambers at the Cape High Court to provide
           urgently required facilities; and


       (b)  that this new Civil Annex will hear civil matters and, in so
           doing, will free the main court for criminal hearings; and


  (2) trusts that the Civil Annex will not only serve to clear the backlog
       of both civil and criminal matters, but will also provide a more
       conducive working environment for hard-pressed Cape High Court
       judges.

[Applause.]

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the FA:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses concern at the rioting by residents of Ikhutseng in the
       Northern Cape over the lack of service delivery by the ANC local and
       provincial governments;


  (2) notes that the community's concerns include a lack of doctors and
       sanitation facilities, poor road infrastructure and problems at
       schools; and


  (3) calls on the premier of the Northern Cape and the mayor of the
       Diamantveld Rural Council to address the concerns of their voters and
       to take steps to restore peace in this area.

Ms C M P RAMOTSAMAI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in
           Zimbabwe, Mr Morgan Tsvangirai, publicly endorsed President
           Thabo Mbeki's handling of the Zimbabwean crisis; and


       (b)  he has characterised the bilaterals between the ANC and the MDC
           as positive;


  (2) believes that the recent public statement by the leader of the MDC in
       Zimbabwe confirmed our long-held view that constructive engagement
       with the government of Zimbabwe is the correct strategic approach to
       prevent catastrophe;


  (3) welcomes the statement by Mr Morgan Tsvangirai; and


  (4) calls on the DA to desist from unfounded and misdirected criticism of
       the Government's approach to the situation in Zimbabwe.

[Applause.]
Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that the crime rate in Cape Town's CBD has dropped by 46% since
           the implementation of the City Improvement District; and


       (b)  that the Unicity is currently training more than 500 community
           police officers, and is planning to spend R8 million on
           expanding the city's closed circuit television camera system;


  (2) therefore congratulates the DA-run city of Cape Town on this
       initiative and encourages the city in its plans to expand the CID
       concept to other areas of Cape Town; and


  (3) calls on the ANC to follow the example of the DA in Cape Town to make
       life safer for all the people of South Africa.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, may I just appeal that we be given
an opportunity to hear the Notices of Motion without too much comment and
noise. [Applause.]

Prof L B G NDABANDABA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) applauds the Pretoria Technikon Council for taking a bold step by
       appointing its first black Vice Chancellor, Prof Langalibalele
       Ngcobo;


  (2) notes that his appointment, confirmed by the Technikon Council last
       week, is a matter of great pride to all of us; and


  (3) congratulates the Technikon Council for the realisation of the
       transformation process, which it has embarked upon.

[Applause.]
Mrs T J TSHIVHASE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that DA MPs decided to visit disgraced former Welfare Minister
       Abe Williams in prison;


  (2) further notes that the DA have loudly, harshly and repeatedly
       attacked the ANC for visiting freedom fighter Allan Boesak in prison;


  (3) believes that this is further evidence of the selective morality of
       the DA and its commitment to stoop to whatever level to demonise the
       ANC; and


  (4) calls on the DA to reconsider its policy of loud, empty shouting
       about everything the ANC does, instead of debating issues on their
       merit.

[Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that as an aftermath of the Tony Yengeni 4x4 fiasco, Daimler
       Chrysler has decided to repossess 19 of the 32 Mercedes Benz motor
       vehicles made available to VIPs, including those with ANC
       connections;


  (2) agrees with Lulama Chakela, Daimler Chrysler's spokesperson, that
       their involvement in the arms deal and the entire issue of cars for
       VIPs has caused irreparable harm to Daimler Chrysler's good name and
       reputation; and


  (3) once again calls on all Members of Parliament to declare all assets
       accruing from the arms deal or otherwise, because it also affects the
       name and reputation of all Members of Parliament.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr M E MABETA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:
  That the House -


  (1) expresses its disgust at the escalating theft of funds meant for
       child maintenance grants at magistrates' courts countrywide, and
       welcomes the conviction of two maintenance officers;


  (2) expresses its concern, however, about the light sentences handed
       down, in the light of the widespread poverty and emotional trauma
       that children endure;


  (3) notes that this theft deprives many children of their sole source of
       support, which is their constitutionally protected right; and


  (4) calls on the Minister of Social Development and the Minister for
       Justice and Constitutional Development to urgently attend to this
       horrific situation, which is causing many South African children to
       suffer unnecessarily on a daily basis.

Mr L M KGWELE: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die ANC sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat 'n vergadering, bygewoon deur ANC-lede van hierdie
       Huis, verteenwoordigers van die Boerevereniging, die Adjunkminister
       vir Landbou en Grondsake en die LUR vir Veiligheid in die Noordwes,
       op Vrydag, 1 Junie in Brits gehou is;


  (2) verder kennis neem dat die vergadering 'n reuse sukses was en 'n
       positiewe grondslag gelê het vir konstruktiewe toekomstige
       betrokkenheid ten opsigte van die uitdagings wat die boeregemeenskap
       in die gesig staar;


  (3) boere in die Brits-gemeenskap gelukwens met hulle verbintenis tot
       samewerking met die Regering, plaaslike regering en openbare
       verteenwoordigers om oplossings vir hul probleme te vind;


  (4) die afbrekende kritiek van sekere elemente ten opsigte van die
       opbouende dinge wat bereik is en hul verdraaiing veroordeel; en


  (5) 'n beroep op boere en plaaswerkers doen om die transformasieproses
       van die landbou te ondersteun en om voort te bou op wat reeds bereik
       is, soos voorgestel en uiteengesit deur die Minister van Arbeid, die
       Landbou-unie en die georganiseerde Plaaswerkersunie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mnr L M KGWELE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next

       representatives of the Farmers' Association, the Deputy Minister for
       Agriculture and Land Affairs and the MEC for Safety in the North
       West, took place on Friday, 1 June in Brits;


  (2) further notes that the meeting was a great success and laid a
       positive foundation for constructive future involvement with regard
       to the challenges facing the farming community;

       achieved, as proposed and explained by the Minister of Labour, the
       Agricultural Union and the organised Farmworkers' Union.]

                          MURDERS IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the recent murder of five people in Chatsworth, KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) expresses shock and concern at these murders; and


  (3) extends its condolences to the family of the five murdered victims.

Agreed to.

               SUPPORT FOR AND APPRECIATION OF ROLE OF SPEAKER

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move the draft
resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper as follows:


  That the House -


  (1) noting -


       (a)  a letter widely circulated outside this House and authored by B
           H Holomisa, MP, on behalf of and in his capacity as leader of
           the United Democratic Movement;


       (b)  the unsubstantiated allegations contained in the letter and the
           media, concerning the conduct of the Speaker;


       (c)  that this is the first ever Parliament in a democratic
           dispensation and the first ever South African Speaker
           functioning in a democratic and multiparty representative House,
           guided by an internationally admired and challenging
           constitutional framework;


       (d)  that, as we are a new democratic order, it can be expected that
           our new democratic institution will be faced with new and
           complex procedural and constitutional issues; and


       (e)  that it is internationally regarded as good practice and
           convention that in the event of a member wishing to criticise a
           Presiding Officer, this should be done through a substantive
           motion tabled in the House and not through an attack on the
           Presiding Officer outside the House; and


  (2) believing that the Speaker -


       (a)  by virtue of the office she occupies, must play a guiding role
           in the development of Parliament and the formulation of
           appropriate procedures and rules; and


       (b)  has exercised her role in a manner consistent with the
           strengthening of Parliament and all representatives within it,


     expresses its support for and appreciation of, the role played by the
     Speaker in protecting and promoting the interests of Parliament and in
     ensuring the participation of all parties represented in Parliament.

Dr Z P JORDAN: Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the motion in
the Chief Whip's name. The issue confronting us today, hon members,
requires that we be very sober-minded and level-headed. If today's debate
were to degenerate into an exchange of invective between the governing
party and the opposition, that would be a great disservice to our country
and to our young democracy.

Speaking in a television debate during the late 1960s, the British
philosopher Bertrand Russell drew a distinction between an open mind and an
empty mind. To elucidate what he meant, Russell employed the analogy of a
juror. No one, he said, suggests that jurors should not hold opinions about
crime. No one suggests that jurors should hold no views about the nature of
the crime. Nor has there been any suggestion that jurors should be unable
to distinguish between serious and trivial offences. We do, however, expect
jurors, whatever opinions they hold, to try each case they hear with an
open mind. That is, we expect them to judge matters after they have heard
all sides of the story and we expect them to make up their minds on the
basis of the facts.

It is a crucial distinction that should be borne in mind in the course of
today's debate. A great deal has been made in our media about a charge to
the effect that Madam Speaker and the other presiding officers are
partisan. I want to submit that not a single member of this House can claim
to be nonpartisan. In fact, given the manner in which our election system
is structured, it would be impossible for a nonpartisan person to win a
seat in this House.

We are all here on the strength of party affiliation. Madam Speaker, the
Deputy Speaker and all the chairpersons and deputy chairpersons who preside
over us at our sittings are members of political parties. In other words,
they are all partisan. However, there is a crucial distinction between
partisanship and partiality, a distinction akin to the distinction Russell
drew about the juror. We accept that our Presiding Officers are partisan.
What we expect of them, however, is impartiality. Like the juror who holds
opinions about crime, we expect them to judge matters on the basis of the
facts before them and not to be swayed by extraneous considerations such as
their party affiliations.

The matter at hand requires us to be level-headed precisely because there
is a tendency on the part of many to conflate partiality and partisanship.
We need to be level-headed as well because the issue we are dealing with is
not solely the person of Madam Speaker, the hon Dr Frene Ginwala. What is
at issue today is the Office of the Speaker. Let us remember, hon members,
that the Office of the Speaker personifies this Parliament. The very title
Speaker embodies that relationship. The Speaker is accorded that title
because the holder of that Office speaks on behalf of Parliament. An attack
on the Speaker is therefore an attack on Parliament as an institution.
[Applause.]

I was consequently quite dismayed at the ill-considered manner in which a
number of members of the Opposition had chosen to toss their hats into the
ring and voice unsubstantiated charges contained in an open letter authored
by the hon Bantu Holomisa, the leader of the UDM. One would have expected
that considerations such as the dignity of this august Assembly would have
persuaded them to proceed with far greater circumspection and caution,
bearing in mind the serious damage careless talk can inflict on this
institution.

One would also urge our media to weigh a little bit more carefully what
they print and say about the Office of the Speaker. No one, and I repeat no
one, least of all I, wishes to curtail the freedom of expression. But, any
undermining of Parliament, which is after all one of the key institutions
of our democracy, cannot be in the public interest. Amazingly, it is the
South African media who have been the worst offenders in confusing
partisanship and partiality. Let me add that quoting practices of
Westminster is of no assistance to us here. What they do in Westminster is
the exception and not the rule.

In every democratic parliament I have looked at, other than that of Zambia,
the Speaker and other presiding officers are members of political parties.
What is more, they remain active in their respective parties while in
office. What every democratic legislature requires of its presiding
officers is not an empty mind, but an open mind. Democratic parliaments
require that the Speaker be impartial, and not nonpartisan. Well, in the
United Kingdom, for reasons rooted in that country's history, they took it
further. But when one looks at other democracies - and I will confine my
remarks here only to Commonwealth countries, but there are others one can
quote - there are a plethora of practices.

During a Conference of Commonwealth Speakers and Presiding Officers in
1996, for example, Mr Alexis Galanos, Speaker of the Cypriot parliament,
informed his audience that he was also the vice-president of his party and
that his predecessor had been the president of the Socialist Party of
Cyprus even while he held the office of Speaker. Another participant in
that meeting, Senator Michael Beahan, president of the Australian Senate,
informed the conference of how active he was within his party, and that
Australians found that unexceptional. Mr Stephen Martin, Speaker of the
Australian House of Representatives, proudly proclaimed at that conference
that not only did he participate in his party's caucus, he has also
responded to queries about such activities by saying that he was elected by
a constituency within Australian society, and he was going to represent
them to the best of his ability but he hoped that did not impair his
capacity to be impartial when presiding over sittings of the House.

There are yet other instances among Commonwealth parliaments where the
Speaker, as a member of a political party, actually votes with his or her
party when a division is called. There are yet others where the Speaker
exercises a casting vote in the instance of a tie. The honourable Betty
Boothroyd, then Speaker at Westminister, revealed that she had occasion to
use her casting vote when there was a tie in the House of Commons. So,
those who are so eager that we emulate the UK example would do well to
contemplate that.

Impartiality does not imply that the Speaker should play a passive role. A
Speaker is expected to be active. A Speaker is expected to interpret the
Constitution. A Speaker is expected to exercise her discretion. A Speaker
is expected to make judgment calls. Those judgment calls might be good, bad
or indifferent. But no one can fault a Speaker for exercising that
discretion. It was in the exercise of that discretion that Madam Speaker
referred the Auditor-General's report to the Public Accounts Committee of
this Parliament. It was Madam Speaker who directed Scopa to examine that
report. But it was equally her duty to offer guidance to the committee and
its chairperson regarding the limits of its powers.

In demanding that the Speaker be impartial, we do not require her to be a
neuter, what Bertrand Russell would have called an empty mind. Of course,
that means there will be occasions when the opinions expressed and actions
taken by the Speaker might invite the displeasure of hon members. There
have been a number of occasions when this side of the House has been
angered by the Speaker's actions. And I am certain there have been other
occasions when she has displeased the opposition benches as well. But,
perhaps that is itself a measure of our Speaker's impartiality. I defy any
member of this House to cite an instance of partiality on the part of Madam
Speaker. I defy any member of this House to cite a single instance of
dereliction of duty.

Because parliaments set such great store by the dignity of the Office of
the Speaker, it is customary that hon members do not publicly criticise or
dissent from the decisions of the Speaker. Should a member or a group of
members feel aggrieved, they are usually required to express their
criticism by way of a substantive motion. Perhaps this Parliament should
require members of this Chamber to act in a like manner. In New Zealand,
for example, even the suggestion that the Speaker has been partial is
considered a breach of parliamentary privilege, and an MP who did that
would be subjected to disciplinary action. Media organisations that glibly
echoed such sentiments would be charged with contempt of parliament.

Hon members, what is at stake in today's debate is not merely the integrity
and dignity of one person. I consider the unsubstantiated, reckless
accusations made against our Speaker as an attack on the dignity and the
integrity of this Parliament. And I am certain that after listening to the
debate, hon members will agree that it is not Dr Ginwala, but the hon Bantu
Holomisa and the party he leads who deserve to be in the dock. But I trust
that the leader of the UDM will have the moral courage, after he has heard
the views expressed in today's debate, to retract his unfounded allegations
and apologise to Madam Speaker and to the House. [Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, it is not a pleasure to participate in this
debate. I regard it as a sad day for Parliament.

The Democratic Alliance believes that the Speaker has mishandled the
allegations by Gen Holomisa. Made outside of Parliament, they should have
stayed outside. We understand that she is contemplating legal action
against him. The mistake was importing the affair and turning it into a
parliamentary crisis. Sometimes it is wiser not to act too precipitately.
If the Speaker had sought advice before she acted, we would certainly have
suggested a different approach.

Be that as it may, the crisis surrounding the Speakership is a fact. The
Speaker herself stated that no self-respecting parliament could tolerate a
Speaker who abused her powers in the way alleged. She said that she did not
want a motion of confidence. She did not need an ANC majority. She
preferred an all-party committee to investigate the allegations and make a
finding. It is clear that the ANC decided to demonstrate to the Speaker
that she does not have an independent power base in Parliament or among the
minorities. They want to show her that she is beholden to the ANC. These
are the tactics of the hon Tony Yengeni, who himself is in contempt of a
parliamentary committee.

A motion of confidence is an entirely inappropriate way of dealing with
this crisis. The tyranny of the majority does not turn vice into virtue.
Should we do away with murder trials and have the citizens voting to decide
the guilt of the murderer? None of the allegations will be substantiated.
None of them will be refuted. This debate leads merely to a stating of
positions without any enquiry, without a meeting of minds and without any
solutions. The outcome will be an enforcement of the will of the majority.
How are people in South Africa going to decide whether the Speaker did or
did not exceed her authority? How can they decide whether she abused her
power? How can they decide whether she deserves criticism? And that is the
problem which this debate fails to resolve.

Speaker Ginwala has made a great contribution to the establishment of
democratic parliamentary traditions in our country. Precedents and
decisions which she has made will live on long after she has left. No one
can take that away from her. She has created a democratic tradition of
being prepared to listen to the voice of minority parties and insisting
that all minority parties have the right to be heard. I want to say that
this is no mean achievement. But it does not mean that the Speaker is above
criticism.

I regret to state that there have been a number of occasions, and many more
recently, when the duality of roles of the Speaker has led to very
unfortunate consequences. It is a fact that she is one of the 10 most
important and senior people in the ANC. When there has been a clash between
her role as a politician and her role as a Speaker, Frene Ginwala the
politician has sometimes won.

This has led to some shocking incidents which have weakened Parliament
instead of strengthening it. One example is the Patricia de Lille case. Mrs
De Lille accused some members of being spies. She properly withdrew her
remarks, but the Speaker allowed what amounted to a kangaroo court to
convict Mrs De Lille and impose an unconstitutional sentence. It did not
need a constitutional lawyer to work out that the sentence was wrong and
unjust. But the Speaker pursued the matter through the Cape High Court and
the Appeal Court, knowing full well that the Powers and Privileges of
Parliament Act was flawed and unenforceable.

Despite the elapse of years, that Act has still not been amended. The
Speaker has indicated that she would like something to happen. She kept on
pointing fingers at Whips and party leaders and said we must take the
initiative. With due respect, it cannot be up to other people to take an
initiative which properly belongs to the Speaker. She has dragged her feet,
and the result is that one can take no action, almost, against a
recalcitrant member of Parliament.
What about the Maduna affair? It ended up bringing Parliament into
disrepute, and Madam Speaker did nothing to prevent that. The ANC and
Minister Maduna got away with something which should not have been
permitted. It was not in the ANC's political interests for any action to be
taken and the Speaker allowed that.

Then, what about the arms deal saga? This has not been a credit to
Parliament or to the ANC. There is a suspicion right around the country
that it has been poorly and ineptly handled by the executive - and
controversially by the Speaker - and the reason is that substantial
donations were made to the ANC election fund by many of those who have
benefited from the arms deal. [Interjections.]

Government, throughout, has been disappointing and suspicious in the
extreme. The Speaker's forays and her fights with the Chairperson of Scopa
have blemished her reputation and image. At the very least, her good
judgment has been called into question and she has, on some occasions,
seemed to bend over backwards to assist the executive instead of calling
the executive to account.

What about the Yengeni affair? It created a bad impression throughout South
Africa. As he drives around in his 4x4 he must reflect whether he has
damaged or strengthened Parliament. [Interjections.] In this, he was aided
and abetted by the ANC majority, and the Speaker allowed it to happen
before her very eyes.

A long and distinguished Speakership has been marred, but much of the
damage could be repaired if we ignore the motion which the hon Dr Jordan
moved on behalf of the Chief Whip, and accept an amendment which I hereby
move. The main part of it reads as follows:


  That the House, noting that -


  (1) serious allegations have been made against the Speaker which must be
       substantiated or refuted;


  (2) the Speaker herself is on record as saying that she favoured an all-
       party committee without an ANC majority; and


  (3) the outcome of a debate on a confidence motion would be determined by
       the ANC, irrespective of the arguments and allegations advanced by
       the other parties, and would weaken Parliament and the Office of the
       Speaker instead of strengthening them,


  therefore resolves to appoint an all-party committee to investigate the
  allegations and the appropriateness of the existing relationship between
  the Speaker, the majority party and the executive, this committee to
  report thereon to the House on or before 29 June 2001.

[Interjections.] I told the Speaker some weeks ago that my party cares
about Parliament and the Office of the Speaker, and it cares about
parliamentary democracy. I have a particular regard and respect for the
Speaker herself, and we regard it as vital that the office which she holds
should emerge strengthened and not weakened.

I want to make an appeal to the ANC, today, and I want to ask them to think
again and do the sensible and honourable thing. They should accede to the
Speaker's own request and let us determine whether the allegations are
substantiated or refuted. They should help us to strengthen Parliament
which is not the plaything of the people who sit here.

This is the people's Parliament. If we weaken and destroy it, we destroy
something that many who sit here and many outside sweated and sacrificed to
establish. [Interjections.] One can be dismissive and one can be derisive
about it. But, the people expect us not to play partisan games here. What I
want to see and what my side of the House wants to see is the strengthening
of the people's Parliament in the interests of all in South Africa.
[Interjections.]

I want to ask whether the ANC is big enough to lay aside its own political
considerations and its political interests, for once, and put those of the
people of South Africa first. [Applause.]

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker, during his input, Mr Gibson accused the Chief
Whip of the Majority Party of being in contempt of Parliament.
[Interjections.] I ask for your ruling. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Gibson, if you said that the hon member was
in contempt of Parliament, then that is unparliamentary.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I said that he was in contempt of a
parliamentary committee. [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, that is unparliamentary.
[Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, we will still have that debate. I withdraw
the statement. [Interjections.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, we, in the IFP, have looked at the
facts surrounding the controversy under discussion, and also the legal
position. We have come to a certain conclusion which we believe is the
right one.

However, before dealing with our conclusion, I wish to state that the IFP
regrets the fact that Parliament has today, inter alia, to debate the
actions of Madam Speaker. We would rather have preferred that this cup be
removed form us. We believe that the matter is fundamental to our democracy
and although it was originally an institutional issue, it has now,
unfortunately, been turned into a political matter.

We have, for the past seven years, enjoyed a good relationship with the hon
Dr Frene Ginwala, both in her personal capacity and as the incumbent of the
Office of Speaker. Therefore, the matter, to us, is not a personal one.

What is of much concern to us is that this debate may further damage the
dignity of the institution of Parliament and the Office of Speaker. We must
be careful not to fall into the trap of trying to score party-political
points at the expense of the Office of Speaker and the institution of
Parliament.

When the first ominous signs of trouble around the so-called arms scandal
appeared, the IFP made its position clear, and it is still its position
today, namely, that we will not become part of a cover-up and a witch-hunt.
We are interested in the truth.
The IFP had a look at the facts surrounding the issues in the controversy.
We also studied the legal position. The main actors in the controversy are
the chairperson of a parliamentary portfolio committee, the leader of the
UDM and the Speaker. We do not propose to comment on the Holomisa issue.
Our looking at what we perceive as the facts shows that Madam Speaker
became involved in the functional affairs of a parliamentary portfolio
committee by, inter alia, calling in the chairperson, and questioning him
about the committee's functional work.

Because of the Speaker's involvement in the functional work of the
committee the chairperson accused her, not only of several factual
inaccuracies but also of what he called:
  Madam Speaker taking the lead in unjustifiably challenging the
  committee's work, imposing her will in ways which have weakened the
  committee in its arms deal related work, and Madam Speaker's actions
  leading to very damaging conflict within the committee.

It is clear that the chairperson of that committee sees Madam Speaker's
involvement as interference which hampered the oversight function and
accountability of his committee. The IFP does not differ from the stand by
the chairperson. This appears to be the origin of the controversy. This
lies at the root of the controversy and not the Holomisa or the Tony Leon
interventions.

Furthermore, the controversy is clouded because the involvement of Madam
Speaker happened at a time when the Government was under heavy fire because
of the arms scandal, and when the said portfolio committee was conducting
serious investigations into the arms scandal.

Regarding the legal position, what can the Speaker do and what can she not
do? What are the role and powers of the Speaker? Therefore, was Madam
Speaker entitled to become involved in the functional affairs of the said
portfolio committee, as she did?
We have looked at the Constitution, the Acts of Parliament, the Rules of
Parliament and the common law of Parliament, which is the established
parliamentary customs and usages as expressed in what I call conventions
and precedents. We have to bear in mind that what may today appear as an
innocent act or step may tomorrow become a parliamentary precedent if not
challenged. This is one reason why we looked seriously at the present
controversy, careful to avoid bad precedents which may, one day, become
binding on all of us.

In some other parliaments speakers are expected to be politically passive.
They do not participate in the political activities of their own party.
They socialise with all parties and build a position of trust with all
parties. Our Speaker and some Speakers of our provincial legislatures are
political activists. They participate in the activities of their political
parties and are holding office as Speaker.

There is of course nothing in the law that prohibits that. We heard Dr
Jordan and also Mr Gibson referring to this position and we are of the
opinion that Parliament should take a careful look at this situation and
try to arrive at a position which is typically South African and which will
clear the Office of Speaker of uncertainty in this respect. Therefore, we
propose the establishment of a committee to look into these and similar
matters so as to remove doubt about the powers and privileges of the
Speaker.

In examining the legal position we also looked at the decision of the
Supreme Court of Appeal in 1998 in the matter of Gauteng Legislature vs
Killian and others. The judgment by our highest court dealt with the powers
and privileges of the Speaker and held that the Speaker had wide-ranging
powers. The judge of appeal referred with approval to the position of the
Speaker in the House of Commons as follows:


  The duties of the Speaker of the House of Commons are as various as they
  are important, and the Speaker is the interpreter and custodian of the
  rights and privileges of the members of the House.

With reference to impartiality the judge said:


  The Speaker is required by the duties of his office to exercise and to
  display the impartiality of a judge.

Something like Caesar's wife, I may add.

Madam Speaker, after we have considered the facts in the controversy and
the legal position, the IFP takes the following position: The motion is not
relevant to the principles at hand, namely how the Speaker should exercise
her powers, nor does it have anything to do with the real issues of the
controversy as, for instance, set out in the letters of Dr Gavin Woods, MP.

Therefore, we have come to the conclusion that although the scope of the
Speaker is wide, Madam Speaker has, in fact, exceeded the limits of her
powers in the Scopa case. We believe she does not have the powers to become
involved, as she did, in the functional affairs of the committee and we
urge her to refrain from doing so.

For all these reasons we in the IFP have resolved not to participate in the
voting and we will accordingly abstain.

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Madam Speaker, the Office of Speaker is a high-risk
job. In the UK nine Speakers of Parliament died violent deaths by way of
execution or murder. The consolation is that today they have a strong
democracy.

Why has the ANC proposed this motion? In doing so the ANC runs the risk of
achieving the opposite of what they intended. Instead of protecting the
independence of the Speaker they are undermining the independence by
proposing a motion of support on behalf of the majority party only. The
effect is to bring the Speaker into the political arena, which should never
have happened.

If anyone here felt that the Speaker should resign or be replaced that
person or party should have brought a motion of no confidence. Nobody in
the opposition did so and for the ANC to bring a motion of support is
unheard of and unnecessary.

Some of the actions of the Speaker do not allow the DA to support the
motion of full confidence in her at this stage. It was wrong for the ANC to
approach the issue of the Speaker in this way. We do not want the Speaker
to resign but we believe she must rectify her actions so that her even-
handedness, her objectivity and neutrality are above all suspicion. The
issue is one that should have been resolved by way of wisdom and consensus,
not by way of a divisive majority vote.

The DA wishes to say that it does indeed appreciate the role played by Dr
Ginwala since 1994. We believe her to be a woman of great character, with
much courage and a lot of wisdom. But even the wisest head can only wear so
many hats. Filling the role of both Speaker and party politician is not
what this Parliament needs. Serving, for instance, on the ANC's National
Working Committee creates an untenable situation for any Speaker.

The DA believes that this debate should not be about the character or the
person of Dr Ginwala, but rather about the role of the Speaker, separated
from the personality of the incumbent in our democracy. Stripped of all the
side issues, the real issue before this House today is actually the kind of
Parliament we want to have in our country, unlike some ANC members who have
by their party-political actions caused the current discussion about the
Speaker to develop into a crisis.

We believe that this debate should have taken place but not under the guise
of a political motion of confidence. It is a healthy and appropriate debate
to be having as a further step in deepening and maturing our democratic
institutions. We must establish a convention in our country about the kind
of Speaker that we want.

Broadly speaking, there are two models: There is the American model with a
highly politicised activist speaker, where the speaker is almost always
controversial and where the speaker is in charge of driving his or her
party's political programme in the House of Representatives. In the British
model the Speaker acts as the apolitical voice of parliament. The moment a
Speaker is elected as Speaker in terms of that model that person withdraws
from all party-political activity. Such a Speaker no longer attends party
caucuses, does not participate in political issues and strives at all times
to perform his or her duties with the utmost impartiality.

Traditionally, the Speaker was never opposed in a parliamentary election
from the side of the opposition because the opposition understood that it
had a duty to protect the impartiality of the Speaker as well. Although in
name the Speaker was a member of parliament, in reality there was a very
disciplined withdrawal from anything that could be interpreted as party
political. The Speaker should be the representatives' representative,
acting to protect and acknowledge every member equally, from the President
to the low member of Parliament from the smallest opposition party.

In 1992 a Labour Party MP was elected Speaker after the British general
election was won by the Conservative Party. She was proposed by a
Conservative Party member of parliament and against four strong
Conservative Party candidates. This is how nonpartisan the Speaker should
be. Simply put, we do not want a Newt Gingrich. We need a Betty Boothroyd.

Our present Speaker played a vital role in establishing parliamentary
democracy. We believe that she must play an equally important role in
establishing the model of the kind of Speaker we want by way of convention
and therefore consensus between all the interests in the House. To empower
this impartial stance the DA believes that the role of the Speaker should
be defined as strictly apolitical, withdrawing from all party activities
upon assumption of that office.

In this way our South Africa Speaker should embody the philosophy expressed
in Speaker Lentor's celebrated reply to the demand of King Charles I for
the arrest of five members of parliament on charges of treason when they
dared to speak out against the King's authority. He said:


  May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to
  speak in this Place, but as the House is pleased to direct me whose
  servant I am here.

We believe that the Speaker is central in changing the tone of the debate
in this Parliament. The simple question to ask is: Do we want a Parliament
that is ridiculed by the people for being petty and irrelevant, or do we
want a Parliament which is celebrated and supported for placing the lives
of the people first?

Te veel kere die afgelope jaar of twee het die debat in hierdie Parlement
niemand, geen party of geen individu, tot eer gestrek nie. Die rondgooi van
beledigings en dreigemente, die bal van vuiste, kleinlike en onwaardige
optrede, het ons Parlement al merkbare skade aangedoen. Die beste waarborg
vir 'n waardige parlement wat gekenmerk word deur sinvolle debat is 'n
Speaker met 'n sterk sin vir regverdigheid wat die vermoë het om deur sy of
haar optrede 'n atmosfeer van waardigheid in hierdie Huis te skep wat
kenmerkend moet wees van 'n raadsaal waar die nasie se belangrikste sake
bespreek word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Too many times during the past year or two the debates in this Parliament
were not to the credit of anyone, any party or individual. The levelling of
insults and threats, clenching of fists, petty and undignified behaviour,
have caused our Parliament substantial harm. The best guarantee for a
dignified Parliament characterised by meaningful debate is a Speaker with a
strong sense of fairness who has the ability to create, through his or her
conduct, an atmosphere of dignity in this House which should be
characteristic of a Chamber in which the most important issues concerning a
nation are discussed.]

By formalising the role and responsibility of the Speaker as an apolitical
one, we would send a loud and clear message to the people of our country
that the interests of democracy are valued more by their Parliament than
the narrow interests of party-political struggles.

The DA will not support this motion. Although we have no wish to propose a
motion of no confidence in the Speaker, we cannot support a motion of full
confidence for two reasons. Firstly, the conduct of Madam Speaker in the
Scopa investigation into the arms deal has left much to be desired, and has
raised legitimate questions about her balancing of party loyalty with
parliamentary responsibilities. With us it created the impression that her
conduct in this regard was part of the suspected wide cover-up regarding
the arms deal.

Secondly, in too many instances the Speaker is seen not to defend the
interests of Parliament against the interests of the executive. She too
easily abandons the protection of the rights of members of Parliament vis-à-
vis members of the executive, or overly protects members of the executive
in this House. The Speaker's responsibility is to defend the rights of
Parliament, not the members of her own party in Cabinet.

In conclusion, the motion by the ANC is a huge disservice to the idea of an
impartial Speaker. I can think of nothing else that would have polarised
and politicised the Office of the Speaker more. To resolve the outstanding
questions, we believe a multiparty committee is the way forward. We believe
wisdom and common loyalty to Parliament as an institution representing the
interests of the people was and remains the way forward.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

Ms F I CHOHAN-KOTA: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I thought I heard
the hon Douglas Gibson saying something when he was making his speech, and
it has since been confirmed that he, in fact, did say this, that when the
hon Speaker took her case to court, she did so knowing that it had no legal
basis and that she would lose it.

I want to suggest that this implies that the Speaker acted in bad faith
when she spent public money and that this, in fact, infers extreme mala
fide in her person. I want to suggest that this is actually
unparliamentary. [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, I will have to look at that to see
the context in which those remarks were made, in order to assess the
conclusion that you are making. So I would rather not take that issue as a
point of order on which to make a ruling at the present moment.

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, the comparison that the hon MP Pallo Jordan
is drawing is, in fact, motivating, acknowledging and also justifying why
the hon Speaker acted in a partial manner. If the object of this debate is
to establish the confidence of the House in the Speaker, I submit, with
humility, that it is misguided. The UDM has not as yet questioned the hon
Speaker's integrity to preside in the House. What we are seeking is
clarification on all the matters raised in the letter in question. We are
therefore not in a position to vote on this motion as it stands.

However, we submit that Madam Speaker has always articulated a vision of a
people-centred Parliament with doors open to the real world beyond. But she
is human. By making the legitimate choice that she did, that is to remain
an active member of the ANC and its internal structures, such as the
national working committee, she created the conditions in which one day the
moment would arrive when she would have to withstand intense political
pressure from within her own party to exercise judgment in a way that would
serve its short-term interests. We believe that that day came shortly
before the end of last year, and we believe, moreover, that at that point
the Speaker made a misjudgment.

As subsequent disputes and legal opinions have shown, there are a number of
reasonable interpretations of the 14th report of Scopa, specifically in
relation to what it intended by way of the composition and remit of the
joint investigation into the arms procurement package. Hence, it was
unreasonable of the Speaker to have offered only one interpretation on 27
December last year an interpretation that was expedient and useful to the
executive. As a result, the Heath unit was subsequently excluded from the
investigation by the Government against the wishes of this House.

The executive took upon itself the responsibility to appoint the three
agencies to carry out the investigation, without even a clear brief and
terms of reference, in disregard of the parliamentary process that had
preceded their decision, thereby casting a shadow over the important
principle of separation of powers of the executive from those of the
legislature. In this sense, Madam Speaker put the executive's needs ahead
of those of her own Parliament.

We trust that reports and rumours that Madam Speaker subsequently
compounded this error of judgment by attending meetings of the ANC study
group on Scopa to advise on a joint strategic approach are unfounded. If
she had done so, we believe, she would have overstepped the line between
reasonable party activity as a Speaker, and unreasonable party activity,
given the delicate nature of the matter with which Scopa was engaged and
the importance of the arms procurement investigation to the nation as a
whole. Either way, vital constitutional issues have been thrown out. They
must be addressed now or they will continue to haunt us in the future.

For Parliament to operate as an institution of independent accountability
over the executive requires that members of the ruling party exercise
oversight over colleagues of their own caucus, especially those comrades
who always shout ``Viva!'' on Saturday and on Monday change and receive
motorcars from companies. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Madam Speaker, I
rise in support of the motion before us today. I would like to remind many
that approximately 46 years ago, our people gathered at the Congress of the
People in Kliptown and pledged amongst other things, and I quote:


  We, the people of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world
  to know:


  ... that our people have been robbed of their birthright to land, liberty
  and peace by a form of government founded on injustice and inequality;
  ...


  And we pledge ourselves to strive together, sparing neither strength nor
  courage, until the democratic changes here set out have been won.


  The people shall govern!


  Every man and woman shall have the right to vote for and to stand as a
  candidate for all bodies which make laws; ...

I thought this excerpt was appropriate to serve as a reminder that the
majority of members in this House are elected representatives, committed to
the Freedom Charter and the constitutional democracy.
The Speaker, when elected as Speaker to this democratic institution for the
first time in 1994, captured the spirit of the Congress of the People in
her acceptance speech, when she reflected on the importance of Parliament
as a central institution in constitutional democracy. For her, like many
others in this House, this came with a lifetime of political struggle and
activism.

She stated the following, and I quote:


  ... the character of this Assembly must become the voice of the people of
  South Africa, articulated through their elected representatives.


  This House is both the fulfilment and the repository of the values and
  principles that, at great cost, have driven changes through which our
  country and its people are passing.


  All eyes will be on this Parliament as it meets to address the needs and
  expectations of all South Africans. May our proceedings here, whatever
  our political differences, be marked by a spirit of mutual respect for
  one another and for the institution of a constitutional democracy.

As we gather here in this august House today, we are deeply conscious that
we have elected members in this House who appear to reflect a lack of
commitment to this democracy and this institution, through allegations and
irresponsible actions. They appear not to be concerned about the interests
of this institution nor of Parliament and, above all, not about our
Constitution.

We see this through interpretations that were made earlier by the hon
Douglas, not to mention this open letter that was put out by the hon
Holomisa. Allow me to refer, in some detail, to some of the constitutional
dimensions of the debate that we are engaged in today.

The liberal media, the intellectual community and opposition parties that
assume the liberal mentality, are describing this debate as being about
``the separation of powers'' in a democracy. The usage is in line with the
constitutional preamble that determines that there shall be a separation of
powers between the legislature, executive and judiciary, with the
appropriate checks and balances to ensure accountability, responsiveness
and openness.

Let me venture to explain the separation of powers principle, being a
member of the executive, which consciously operates within this framework.
The liberals in our midst persist in interpreting the separation of powers
as an absolute divide. In the process, they ignore judgment on this matter,
as was already handed down in 1996 by the Constitutional Court when it
concluded:


  No constitutional scheme can reflect a complete separation of powers. The
  scheme is always one of partial separation.

Here the Constitutional Court quoted an American case in which a court
concluded that areas are partly interlacing, not wholly disjointed. I will
come back to this very important judgment. Now, maybe seeing things in the
absolute is the luxury of those who continue to be on the side as
spectators and never actually have to enter the fray of reality and have to
cope with the tensions and trade-offs that real life and decision-making
entail.

The Speaker and Government do not have that luxury. We do have to make
decisions and make decisions fast, but always trying to strive through to
the bigger aim and direction, in our instance, that of achieving and
strengthening democracy, with the aim of eradicating the injustices of the
apartheid past.

The second general observation, centres on the trend systematically to
undermine or attempt to undermine institutions and offices that underpin
our democracy, to show dispersion at the slightest provocation and to try
to create the impression that our constitutional democracy is under threat.
This is very irresponsible politicking and it will not succeed.

To attempt to force constitutional crisis where it does not exist, is
tantamount to treasonous behaviour and, in today's global context, such
attempts may have effects on our economy. So, let us be careful that we are
not operating in a fishbowl, because many of us operate in that fishbowl
and assume it is a large ocean, never mind the global validity.

The institutions of our democracy are still being developed. They have all
the potential, the pent-up energy and the desire to grow and flourish, and
we must and will nurture, protect and defend their growth. When we engage
with matters of our Constitution, it requires much more than a tentative
touch in our endeavours to clarify some of the areas that have been left
vague in the wording or situations that have not necessarily been foreseen
in the drafting.

However, the process of thrashing out the nitty-gritty requires a higher
level of responsibility from all of us in this House. The issue is not
whether either the ANC or the opposition and the minority parties carry the
responsibility. It is a matter of how we, collectively, as the
representatives of our people, discharge our responsibility as leaders and
show decorum and restraint where this is required.

Now, coming to the relationship between the executive and Parliament,
because we have had quantification on this matter, brief as it may have
been, there is no single manner in which different countries have been
organising the relationship between the legislature and the executive.
Although the broad pattern of instituting some separation is apparent in
all democracies, the degree thereof differs.

Unfortunately, given the overpowering influence, even in the fishbowl, in
instances of material in international languages which we can generally
access, that is English and a smattering of Dutch, we tend to think that
the models adopted by Britain, the USA and the Netherlands are the only
constitutional models that we can considerably draw from. Yes, it is true
that in these countries members of the executive do not have a shared claim
to being members of the legislature. They either resign from those
positions or they have never belonged to the legislature in the first
place. However, for example in the German system, this is not the case.
Dual roads of belonging to the executive and the legislature are common,
and it is equally feasible to draw from such examples.

Now, the paranoia with complete separation comes when we attempt to see our
constitutional democratic system as made up of separate parts, instead of
seeing the very dynamic relationships between the parts, looking beyond the
structures and concentrating on the various checks and balances. Again, as
the Constitutional Court said in 1996, when it certified the Constitution:


  The separation-of-powers doctrine is not fixed or is not a fixed or rigid
  constitutional doctrine. It is given expression in many different forms
  and made subject to checks and balances of many kinds. It can thus not be
  said that a failure to separate completely the functionaries of the
  executive and the legislature is destructive of the doctrine.


  Indeed, the overlap provides a singularly important check and balance of
  the exercise of executive power. It makes the executive more directly
  answerable to the elected legislature. Cabinet members are compelled to
  provide Parliament with full and regular reports concerning matters under
  their control and, finally, the legislature has the power to remove the
  President, and indirectly the Cabinet.

When we drafted the South African Constitution, we consciously opted for a
model that would take cognisance of our historical circumstances. We opted
for a system that would allow the executive actively to lead, yet keep them
answerable and accountable. We designed the legislative process in which
the executive provides the impetus for new policy and legislation, but
through deliberative process in Parliament, and particularly in the
committee system, the legislature shapes and moulds the contents thereof.
In the end, it is only the legislature that can pass legislation and
formally adopt policy. Obviously, the legislature can also initiate its own
legislation separately from the executive and this constitutional right
remains.

However, nowhere does the Constitution, which is supreme in this country,
dare I remind the House, allow the legislature to give instructions to the
executive through any other avenue than passing an Act. In all other
circumstances, they recommend. The executive still has the choice and the
responsibility, after having weighed up all the information at its disposal
and having taken into consideration a broad range of dynamics to make the
decisions. Any attempt to have it differently is unconstitutional and the
Speaker, justifiably and rightfully so, rules on such matters accordingly.
This is exactly how the parliamentary law adviser had advised the Speaker
on these matters. I will quote to the House from his advice to remind those
who tend to forget easily:


  The application of section 55, which gives Parliament certain oversight
  functions over the executive, is that Parliament calling the executive to
  account does not entail giving instructions to the executive. Parliament
  can make recommendations to the executive and it is then for the
  executive to decide how to react to that. If Parliament wants to give
  instructions to the executive, their only route is through legislation.

This is how it happened in the case of putting together the investigative
team that is to be involved in the arms deal enquiry. The Speaker acted in
line with the Rules of this Parliament, with the Constitution that she
helped to craft, in line with the advice she was given in terms of the
relationship between Parliament and the executive. The hon Jordan spoke to
this at length but those who have their written speeches and cannot depart
from that, could not relate to what he had raised. [Applause.]

Any Speaker worth his or her salt would have made exactly the same ruling.
Even Idasa, in its review on democracy and the arms deal, states:


  As the Speaker rightly pointed out on 27 December, for Parliament to
  instruct the executive, to grant the SIU a proclamation, this would be of
  a dubious legal and constitutional validity.

To complain of a Speaker paying attention to the fine points of legality,
such as member Holomisa is doing, or being unnecessarily legalistic as the
hon Gibson suggests, where the law is quite clear, is opportunistic to say
the least. Most probably, if I could venture, it is because Gen Holomisa
ruled through military force in the short time of his leadership in his
bantustan, that he can so easily disregard parliamentary convention and
legality. Let us give him the benefit of the doubt. [Applause.]
Let me pay some specific attention to the oversight role of the
legislature. The parliamentary system we have put in place provides for an
abundance of mechanisms to fulfil this role and strengthen it. The
committee system, where a commensurate parliamentary portfolio committee
accompanies every Cabinet portfolio, is a very powerful mechanism. In
addition, the question-and-answer sessions in Parliament have been reformed
to allow more access for smaller parties, who cannot spread themselves
adequately across the various portfolio committees to exercise some
democratic oversight. The Constitution also provides for another category
of checks and balances, these being the Chapter 9 institutions. In
addition, we have created a variety of executive agencies.

I would like to go on to the relationship between the Speaker and
Parliament. The independence of the Speaker - Comrade Jordan has gone into
that in detail - from political party affiliations and activities seems to
preoccupy the thoughts of many. Similar to the points I have made, in terms
of the executive-legislature relationship, there is not a single model in
terms of the situation of the Speaker, although our liberal colleagues, who
only immerse themselves in old, colonial, Anglophone systems would wish us
to believe differently.

Journalists such as Barry Streek, with overwhelming enthusiasm, quote the
British example, where the Speaker resigns from his or her party on
election and, on completion of their term in the Chair, is elevated to the
House of Lords. He relies on a statement of two quite questionable
authorities to give credence to his suggestion that if we do not follow
suit, the system that this House has opted for is of lesser quality and
will automatically give rise to problems.

Who are these authorities? They are an expatriate South African who is a
member of the British parliament and none other than Louis le Grange, the
former Minister of Police, whom many of us would rather like to forget than
to be reminded of as a role model. These are the kind of people that are
being referred to in the examples. The correct question to ask in terms of
the Speaker-Parliament relationship is not whether or not the incumbent
belongs to any party represented in the House, but rather whether the
execution of duties of the Speaker or Chairperson has been done
appropriately. Let us remember that it is not the Speaker who is on trial
here today.

Let us ensure that if there is anyone who wishes to cast aspersions on the
Speaker in terms of the manner in which she has carried out her
responsibility as Speaker, and if they want to use or abuse their rights as
members of Parliament to do so, it should be done in terms of the entire
spectrum of the Speaker's decisions and actions. We cannot be allowed to be
drawn in as silent participants in a process shaped by the flawed
interpretation of a specific incident by the leader of a small party. In
the history of this Parliament such behaviour will be interpreted as the
tacit condoning of a hatchet job by a man with an overinflated opinion of
himself and his role in history. [Applause.]

Let me conclude by saying that in terms of the lifetime of achievement that
Madam Speaker has had, she has been recognised in international forums the
likes of Holomisa, Leon and Gibson have only heard about. She is currently
the co-chairperson of the Global Coalition ... [Time expired.][Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, we in the ACDP want to endorse the fact
that the hon Speaker has played a very important role in protecting the
interests of Parliament and ensuring the participation of all parties
represented in Parliament. The fact that we disagree with the way she
handled issues such as the arms procurement report in this House, does not
detract from the fact that she has been a good Speaker. She has set a good
precedent that continues to guide other Presiding Officers when they are in
the Chair.

We believe that a call by the ANC for a vote of confidence or no confidence
in the Speaker is not appropriate or relevant at this stage. It would be
unfair for any party to obliterate with one stroke the good work that the
incumbent has done during the past seven years because of one or two
mistakes.

While we understand the concerns expressed by the hon Mr Holomisa
concerning the arms deal, we believe they should have been raised in the
correct parliamentary forum. We believe that he should have directly
confronted the Speaker if he did not want to raise his concerns in the
House. What the ACDP would like to see is an all-party committee without an
ANC majority, as was suggested by the hon Speaker herself, to investigate
the allegations made by the hon Bantu Holomisa against the Speaker. The
allegations must either be substantiated or refuted. We believe that this
can only be done in such a committee and not in the House this afternoon.

Lastly, we propose that the hon Mr Holomisa should withdraw his remarks and
that the Speaker should accept mediation and arbitration instead of
fighting this matter in court. The ACDP will abstain from voting on the
motion before the House but will instead support the amended motion.

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, today's debate is not about the hon Speaker
or the Office of the Speaker. This debate is about the ANC. The ANC as a
liberation movement finds it almost impossible to act in the way that is
expected of a political party in a multiparty democracy every time it comes
under attack.

This motion today is merely being used as a smokescreen. It is therefore
not strange that today the ANC has decided to use its three best spin
doctors, woordkunstenaars, namely the hon Dr Jordan, the hon Minister
Moleketi and the number one spin doctor, the hon Jeremy Cronin.
[Interjections.]

As hulle drie nie hierdie saak vir die ANC se gewone lede kan regpraat en
verduidelik nie, sal niemand, maar niemand, dit kan doen nie! [If the three
of them cannot justify and explain this case to the ordinary members of the
ANC, nobody, but nobody will be able to!]

Section 55 of the Constitution deals with accountability and the oversight
functions of Parliament. Rule 206 of the Rules of the National Assembly is
quite wide. Section 92(2) of the Constitution deals with the accountability
of the executive.

Gister het Christie van der Westhuizen van Beeld in 'n baie goeie artikel
in Beeld Forum die volgende geskryf:


  Woods vestig ook die aandag op Ginwala se vreemde beperkende versoek om
  'n regsmening, naamlik of Skoor se verslag die spesifieke insluiting van
  die Heath-eenheid gevra het. Die ooglopende antwoord is nee, maar daar is
  'n ander regsmening gegrond op die korrekte vraag, naamlik: het Skoor
  bedoel dat al vier die gespesifiseerde agentskappe, waarvan die Heath-
  eenheid een was, moes deel wees en ingesluit word, en die antwoord daarop
  natuurlik is ja.


  Die bostaande bewys dat die Speaker vroeg al instrumenteel was in die
  uitsluiting van die Heath-eenheid en die beperking van Skoor se rol. Die
  vraag is eenvoudig dit: in opdrag van wie is dit gedoen?

Dit is die vraag. Vandag word die konsepbesluit gebruik om te maak asof dit
oor die Speaker gaan. Dit gaan nie oor die Speaker nie, dit gaan oor die
ANC. Die VF kan nie vandag die konsepbesluit voor die Huis steun nie. Dit
het met die Speaker niks uit te waai nie, dit gaan oor die beskerming van
die ANC. Ons sal stem vir die amendement. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Yesterday Christie van der Westhuizen of Beeld wrote the following in a
very good article in Beeld Forum:

That is the question. Today the motion is being used to make it seem as if
it is about the Speaker. It is not about the Speaker, it is about the ANC.
The FF cannot support the motion of the House today. It has nothing to do
with the Speaker, it is about protecting the ANC. We will vote for the
amendment. [Interjections.]]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that the motion
introduced by the ANC to express its vote of confidence in Madam Speaker,
Dr Frene Ginwala, is indicative of a crisis faced by Parliament today. The
motion is a reaction to serious allegations brought against her by the
leader of the UDM, the hon Gen Bantu Holomisa. These allegations are
serious and warrant an investigation, as they focus on her role in the
ongoing arms procurement investigation and as a leader of the legislature.

She is supposed to be impartial when dealing with matters that affect the
relationship between the legislature and the executive. If there are any
traces of truth in these allegations, the Speaker will be destroying the
same democracy she fought for by eroding the powers of Parliament as an
independent institution capable of making the executive account for its
decisions and actions.

The UCDP calls for the establishment of a multiparty subcommittee to
investigate and test the allegations raised by the UDM. The ANC motion to
support the Speaker is not going to serve any useful purpose but will allow
them to exercise their electoral strength. The crux of the matter is for
the Speaker's name to be cleared of any wrongdoing by this multiparty
committee. The UCDP does not necessarily agree with the UDM that she should
be dismissed as a punitive measure against her. She has made our
legislature one of the best managed in the world and her record speaks
volumes. We have no reason to doubt her integrity and leadership skills, as
she is a capable person.

With these remarks, the UCDP will have difficulty in supporting the motion
and therefore we will go for an amendment to the motion.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, the PAC does not support what is clearly a
motion of confidence in the Speaker because the very notion of a motion of
confidence implies doubt about the confidence this House has in the hon
Speaker. In our view, we find it improper for the House to sit in judgment
over the Presiding Officer of the House. We would prefer that a committee
should be established to investigate all allegations and complaints against
the hon Speaker. To do so does not imply that the hon Speaker is guilty.
The truth of the matter is that our hon Speaker has been outstanding in
many respects but, like the rest of us, she is not infallible.

We need a mechanism for hearing legitimate complaints against the hon
Speaker. The complaints that the hon Speaker has interfered with Scopa's
work need careful investigation, not by Parliament in its sometimes
inquisitorial and even charged debates. This House, with respect, is ill-
suited to hear sensitive issues. It is equally improper to demand of people
raising problems or criticisms to apologise before their complaints are
investigated. The PAC respects Parliament, and the Constitution and will
never participate in any actions that will undermine Parliament. No one is
above Parliament including the hon Speaker. We are all subject to the
Constitution.

The extent to which the ANC will go to divert the attention of the nation
away from the real issue of investigating the arms deal, is limitless. We
appeal to the ANC for the sake of transparency and accountability to allow
for the establishment of a fully representative committee to investigate
these complaints and to report to Parliament as soon as possible.

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, the role of Speaker of Parliament is
important and facilitates, to a large extent, the success of the
interaction between Government and Parliament and between political
parties. This is more so in our newfound democracy where the Speaker has to
guide the proceedings and functions of Parliament through the rough and
tumble of party politics. A great responsibility therefore rests upon the
hon Speaker and this is no easy task. Uneasy is the head that wears the
crown. The hon Speaker has excelled herself up until now.

The respect paid to the hon Speaker is determined by the just and impartial
way and the direction she points the mace of her authority when
intervention is required. Yet, the wound a biased reprimand or intervention
may inflict also leaves a scar and generates criticism. No parliament can
function without rules or agreed upon conventions. They are necessary and
should be honoured. To fall back on a rigid implementation of the rules to
enable the majority to decide a dispute between the Speaker and political
parties will not answer the question of the abuse of the Office of the
Speaker. The answer will rather be found in the attitude and the
application of the Speaker's authority during the Speaker's term of office.

Let the political parties present in Parliament create a new convention and
thrash out the problems, and suggest a solution to the Speaker. This is the
option that the amendment gives and which we will support. If criticism
does arise, such as is the case now, let the impartiality of the decisions
of the past be the final judge, and not the support of the dominant
majority in this Chamber, from which source the Speaker was appointed.

After all is said and done, it is clear in my mind that the position and
future of a relevant and respected Speaker rests in their own hands, and it
will be determined by her own biased decisions from the Chair, and not by a
vote of confidence of the majority party in Parliament. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, Speaker Ginwala, the MF supports Speaker
Ginwala all the way. [Applause.] She is a remarkable woman who has to her
credit outstanding achievements in politics, and she has taken Parliament
to new heights during her service for the past seven years. [Applause.]
Speaker Ginwala is an intelligent, respectable and dedicated woman who has
represented our country both nationally and internationally on many
occasions. A person of her calibre should not go unnoticed, let alone be
slandered.

Even the French Prime Minister, Mr Lionel Jospin, in his address to
Parliament last week, praised Speaker Ginwala for her efficiency in the
post that she holds. It is unfair and unjust to blame the Speaker for
issues surrounding the arms procurement deal, as she has not only acted
lawfully, but was also protecting the interests of Parliament by ensuring
that all parties have an equal chance to be represented.

The MF recommends that a proper investigation into the conduct of the
Speaker be carried out, and thereafter parties should come to an agreement
on the resolution of this matter before any further defamatory remarks are
made. The MF stands by the Speaker and believes that she is innocent of any
allegations against her. The MF is confident that Speaker Ginwala is still
the most responsible and efficient person to hold the said position in
Parliament, and that she should be given a chance to carry out her duties
without any further interference by the media and party members.

The MF supports the motion. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, the hon Frene Ginwala was elected Speaker of
this Parliament unanimously. Surely, this was a vote of confidence in her.
In the debate on the Vote of Parliament last year, no single member of this
House opposed that Vote. Clearly, this should be regarded as a motion of
confidence in the Speaker, who is the de facto Minister of Parliament.
Personally, I have great respect for Speaker Ginwala, respect for the
dignified way she performs her duty outside this House, and while she is
presiding. If I were confronted with the conclusion of the ANC's motion as
it stands bold on the circulated Order Paper, I would support it without
hesitation and with a clear conscience. But this motion stands in a
particular context, a context involving a specific complicated series of
events.

Some two weeks ago the Speaker arranged a meeting with the Whips or leaders
of all parties. In my case, it did not make a difference! She consulted us
on the way forward regarding these allegations. The honest advice of all
parties was that a committee of Parliament should investigate the whole
matter, not as a witch-hunt, but to reach a satisfactory solution. The
Speaker herself did not want any procedure through which her integrity
should be decided upon by a mere ANC majority, as will happen today.

As Speaker, the hon Ginwala is the Speaker of Parliament as a whole, and
not of the ANC alone. The ANC caucus shockingly decided otherwise. I am
asked here today to give my vote on a matter involving two persons - the
hon Ginwala and the hon Holomisa - after only reading a few documents. That
is impossible, and it would be immoral. As much as I would normally like to
follow my heart and support a vote of confidence in the Speaker, this has
been made impossible by the majority party's unilateral majority bulldozing
of a matter which concerns everyone in this House. I was deprived of the
opportunity to get the information. I am not prepared to be a judge if I am
deprived of the facts.

The AEB, therefore, has no choice but to support the amendment, and should
the amendment be defeated, I have no choice but to abstain on the original
motion.

Mr J P CRONIN: Madam Speaker, the hon Gibson said something with which I
profoundly agree. For once he said that the people expect us not to play
with Parliament. I think that is exactly the message that we as the ANC
want to send to the people today, that we will not allow Parliament, its
institutions and its Speaker to be played with.

But in fact this debate is not really about the Speaker, nor has it been
precipitated by the actions of the Speaker. This debate is part of a wider
commotion going on on the opposition benches in pursuit of sound bites
around the arms deal. Notwithstanding the fact that Parliament, including
them, approved the Defence Review, notwithstanding the fact that this
Parliament has recently recommended, and seen implemented, a comprehensive
investigation into the arms procurement process - which we welcome since it
is important that that should happen - as an investigation that is going on
right now as we speak, notwithstanding all of this, some opposition parties
are tripping over themselves in pursuit of headlines, sound bites and TV
cameras. In this scramble for attention, anything and everything is grist
to the mill.

Recently, the Public Protector was slandered, on the flimsiest of rumours,
and not just by publications like Noseweek, whose principal informant
appears to be a discredited scoundrel, Bheki Jacobs, but even by some MPs
sitting in this House who are prepared to go outside and amplify and
broadcast this kind of slander. We have a strange situation here in South
Africa. The Public Protector had to come to Parliament to request
Parliament to protect him from the slander of MPs. And the Speaker had to
tell the Public Protector, who reports to us after all, all of us from
different parties, that we cannot deal with those MPs because they made the
remarks outside of Parliament.

In other Houses one hears MPs challenging each other, saying: ``I dare you
to say outside of Parliament what you have said here.'' Here we have to beg
some opposition MPs to come and say in Parliament what they dare to say
outside in public. This is not democracy. This is anarchy. And now the
Speaker, the spokesperson of our Parliament, has also been caught up in
this nest-fouling frenzy. Because that is what it is - undermining the
dignity of this House itself.

As many speakers, specifically the ANC speakers, have said before me, when
it comes to the role of Speakers around the world, there is a broad
spectrum of international examples. We have heard the Westminster example
being cited time and again. Hon Van Schalkwyk also mentioned this. In
actual fact, the Westminster system is the exception rather than the rule.
There is no reason why we should necessarily follow it, but it is the
exception. In the Westminster system, as the hon Van Schalkwyk says, the
Speaker resigns from her or his political party, and never again returns to
active party politics. The retired Speaker, even after retiring, is given a
peerage and sits, not on one or the other side of the House of Lords, but
on the cross-benches, to mark the fact that they remain in permanent
neutrality. The Speaker, apparently - I do not know if this is true in the
UK parliament - does not even eat with MPs. [Laughter.]

This assumption of neutrality in the British system is the exception,
certainly in the Commonwealth with the possible exception of Zambia. It is
also very, very rare in the rest of the world. It has evolved out of a
feudal era parliamentary system, when the House was made up of aristocrats
and large landowners, and when there were no political parties. It is also
connected to the fact that in the UK parliament is sovereign. We are not
dealing with a constitutional democracy such as we have here. The Speaker
is then the personification of parliament vis-à-vis the executive. It is a
role more akin perhaps to a Constitutional Court judge in our democratic
system.

In the majority of other systems, the Speaker is much more typically part
and parcel of the rough and tumble of multiparty democracy. One will find
this in the United States and Australia, and - this is the hypocrisy of
what we heard today - one will find this operating in the Western Cape
legislature. [Applause.] Has Mr Doman, the Speaker in the Western Cape
legislature, resigned from his party? Has he resigned? Of course he has
not. The same could be said of the IFP Speaker in KwaZulu-Natal. One cannot
have it both ways! But this is an important point.

I think that we want our Speakers to be part and parcel of the rough and
tumble of the political system. We are living in a constitutional
democracy, we are not in a Westminster-style democracy. We want Speakers to
act impartially when they are chairing the proceedings of the House and
when they are conveying resolutions of this House to the executive and so
on. We expect them to act meticulously and impartially. But, we do not
expect them to be politically neutered, as the hon Pallo Jordan said.

However, one cannot have it both ways. If they are that kind of robust
Speakers, then - and this is the flipside - the Speaker must expect to be
challenged more frequently in the proper ways and through the correct
channels. Indeed, let us take the Australian example. Since the 1940s,
there have been more than a dozen cases in which there have been motions of
no confidence in the Speaker. In some cases, the Speaker survived narrowly
by three or four votes. However, regarding the hon Gibson, I would like to
tell him that there was no national crisis and no meltdown, nor were there
any allegations of a majority tyranny when a Speaker survived a motion of
no confidence as a result of the vote from his or her party.

Regarding the hon ``the sober'' Holomisa, I would like to say that even in
Australia, MPs' criticisms of the Speaker have to be by way of a
substantive motion in the House. There is no question of wild allegations
or some quasi-investigative committee of inquiry. [Interjections.] The
contradiction of this proposal, which comes from Mr Gibson's actual
alternative motion, is that a decision of a committee has to come to this
House, in any case. One cannot avoid a debate, here, in the House.
[Interjections.]

The hon member referred to allegations that need to be referred to a
committee but there are no substantive allegations before this House.
Nothing has been formulated in any kind of substantive motion. It is a
complete contradiction. [Interjections.] What that hon member wants to do
is to be able to slander and badmouth the Speaker outside, to the media,
but he does not want to come to this House by way of a substantive motion
so that we can really judge the matter effectively.

Let us now forget about international examples and turn to ourselves. On 18
January, the Chief Whip of the opposition, the hon Douglas Gibson, issued a
press statement - not through some motion in the House or through some kind
of substantive process but through a journalistic process. Of course, in
his statement, there were rhetorical flourishes, curtsies and bouquets.
``We care about parliamentary democracy'', the hon Gibson assured us. ``The
Speaker'', he told us and, he has again told us, ``has contributed
enormously to establishing the style and character of our democratic
Parliament.''

So much for the flourishes. But, at the heart of that press statement from
Mr Gibson was a very serious allegation. He said: ``The Speaker has let
Parliament down. Her unnecessary legalistic approach has contradicted the
view of Parliament. Her role is to represent Parliament to the executive.
If she has contradicted the views of Parliament, that is a very, very
serious breach of exactly what she has to do.''

As we all know, the principal point of contention in this is the Speaker's
understanding of Scopa's Fourteenth Report. The Speaker has quite correctly
stated that the Scopa report, which was adopted by us here in this House,
did not recommend to the executive that the Heath Special Investigating
Unit should be included in any eventual investigation of the arms package.
[Interjections.]

Being a perfectly intelligent person, the Speaker was able to read the
report that we voted on and made her own independent judgment. However,
just to be certain, she sought out the advice of the chief Parliamentary
Law Adviser, Adv A M Meyer. Advocate Meyer is not a member of the ANC's
National Working Committee. He is not a member of the ANC's National
Executive Committee, nor is he a member of the ANC's parliamentary caucus.
The following is what the Parliamentary Law Adviser had to say and I quote:


  The only reference to the Heath Unit in the Report is to the effect that
  the Unit and certain other investigative bodies should be invited to an
  exploratory meeting convened by the Committee so that the best
  combination of skills, legal mandates and resources can be found for such
  an investigation.


  The report envisages that a chosen investigating body will undertake the
  investigation, but there is no indication that that body should
  necessarily be the Unit or include the Unit.

Advocate Meyer goes on:


  Therefore, in our opinion, the Report does not amount to a recommendation
  to the Executive to refer the matter in question to the Unit for
  investigation.

Those are not the words of the ANC's National Working Committee but the
words of the chief Parliamentary Law Adviser.

In representing Parliament, the Speaker has to be meticulous, particularly
on contentious issues like these. It is not her job to put a report onto an
analyst's couch and then sit and listen to the words and produce some kind
of deep unconscious meaning from those words that are not apparent to the
rest of us. She has to say precisely what it is that the report says -
nothing else and nothing less. It is not the function of the Speaker to act
like a psychoanalyst. But, of course, when she is meticulous and the result
does not suit Mr Gibson, then he is quick to label her as ``unnecessarily
legalistic''.

The opposition must not blame the Speaker. She did not write the report.
She did not vote on the report, but we did. If members believe that the
actual intention of the report was to ensure that the Heath Unit should be
appointed, then they should blame themselves for not making that crystal
clear in the drafting. I am not sure what the problem is, but I think that
maybe there is a competency and skills problem over there, and they have
difficulty in translating their intentions into words. [Interjections.]
[Applause.] Maybe, we should add in our motion the suggestion that more
resources should be made available to the opposition members over there in
order to help them to draft more clearly. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Eleven days after Mr Gibson's press statement, on 29 January, the Speaker
made herself available to Scopa. She patiently reiterated her views on
Scopa and the arms procurement investigations. She has been absolutely
meticulous and consistent in those views. If Mr Gibson's attack on the
Speaker - a public attack and not the one that has been brought here - was
an attempt to enhance, as he said, ``the workings of our democratic
Parliament'', then the meeting on the 29th, just 11 days after his press
statement, was surely an ideal opportunity - a parliamentary, not
journalistic opportunity - to engage the Speaker with the concerns that Mr
Gibson had trumpeted in his public statement.

I have here, in my hand, the transcript of that meeting. I have read
through it very carefully - once, twice and several times. I was
particularly interested to see what it is that the members of Mr Douglas
Gibson's alliance, the DP and the New NP, had to say to the Speaker. Were
they going to back Mr Gibson up? Honestly, forcefully, robustly but,
perhaps, politely, in countering the Speaker, were they going to say, and
agree with Mr Gibson, that she had let Parliament down and contradicted the
views of Parliament, and that she had been unnecessarily legalistic? Of
course, they did not. One can read the report six times again and one will
still not find them saying that. They knew as we know that Mr Gibson was
grandstanding at the time. [Interjections.] He was not serious. He was not
contributing seriously to the development of democracy in this Parliament.
[Interjections.]

At the end of the interaction with the Speaker, the chairperson, Dr Woods,
said: ``Thank you Madam Speaker. Thank you for your time. Thank you for
taking the initiative to come and speak to us. I think that there has been
a lot of food for thought produced here.'' That was not a chairperson who
was conveying a sense of outrage that the Speaker had contradicted his
committee and let down his committee or Parliament. [Interjections.] If
anything, Dr Woods was anxious in concluding the interaction with the
Speaker to dispel the notion that it was Scopa, and not the Speaker, that
might have done something wrong. He said: ``I think the committee comes
away from this feeling that there is not much that we have done wrong and
that is inconsistent with regulation.'' So, I am not sure whether Dr Woods
was implying that there was a little bit that they might have done wrong
but not very much. [Laughter.] [Applause.] I do not want to speculate on
what he intended.
Dr Woods went on to say: ``I think, we, the committee are left with a
couple of issues of interpretation and accountability issues. I know that
we will handle that positively and all learn from the eventual debates and
outcome of that.'' I would like to assure members that there is no question
here whatsoever of Scopa or any minority view within Scopa that boldly and
honestly argued that it was the Speaker who had acted irregularly. That, of
course, is where this aspect of the whole matter should have ended. But, of
course it did not. In early May, the Scopa Chairperson - who had thanked
the Speaker so profusely at the end of that meeting, here in Parliament,
for explaining matters to the committee - the very same Dr Woods was then
running to the news agency, Sapa, and accusing the Speaker of sidelining
and interfering with Scopa.

Let us just deal briefly with the allegation as the hon Fraser-Moleketi has
already done. Regarding this allegation of interfering with Scopa, it is
the job of the Speaker to ensure that the committees and this House
function effectively and to guide the work of these committees. Scopa - and
this is what she was concerned about - had the impression or seemed to give
the impression that it was going to be able to direct the investigation
through bodies that are not accountable to this Parliament.
What was even more alarming to the Speaker was that there was some
suggestion that Scopa or the chairperson of Scopa wanted to employ a
foreign forensic auditor to investigate our national arms procurement
process. She suggested that this was right out of order. I think that was
not interference but the appropriate guidance given by a Speaker to a
committee that seemed to have lost its way.

However, the beauty contest that is going on for the opposition benches
was, of course, never going to be complete without the entry of one other
contestant into the fray. On 14 May, nearly four months after Mr Gibson's
press statement, Gen Holomisa the Sober took up the hon Gibson's assault
upon the impartiality of the Speaker and therefore upon the legitimacy of
our democratic Parliament.

The hon Gibson learned his politics on the colonial benches of the white
minority Parliament, which is why he has such a fear of majority tyranny.
[Interjections.] He knows how to wrap up his barbs in Westminster finery.
But Gen Holomisa's formative political experience was, of course, a little
bit different. There was nothing subtle about the former bantustan coup
leader's rambling seven-page letter to the Speaker. It is full of the buzz
and excitement of someone who thinks that he might just have seized a radio
station and is about to take the airstrip. [Interjections.] It is a frontal
assault. It is wild. It is full of allegations, unsubstantiated rumours and
complete irrelevancies. He has gone to have a drink, I am sure.

The letter - here it is - is formally addressed to the Speaker. But it is
copied to its real and intended audiences - firstly, the media, secondly,
the diplomatic corps, and thirdly, all UDM structures. And this forward
addressee is particularly significant. The hon Holomisa is in trouble with
the UDM. His own party members are unhappy with his erratic leadership. He
has distinguished himself in the recent past with other wild allegations
about our involvement in the DRC and so forth. The UDM is visibly a party
falling apart, and the general has to do something to rally his remaining
loyal troops. Otherwise he might find himself the victim of a coup.
[Interjections.]

I do not want to go into the details of Gen Holomisa's open letter as if
there were some legal case to be answered in these wild allegations here.
In so far as there is any legal case that arises from this letter it might
be the one that the general himself will have to answer for in a court of
law. Nonetheless, what, generally, does the general have to say? He says
that the Speaker has been sidelining and stalling Scopa's role in regard to
the arms procurement process. But who referred the Auditor-General's
report, which had been requested by the Defence Minister in the first
place, to Scopa? It was the Speaker. It was the Speaker who sought to
protect Scopa in a letter to the parliamentary Leader of Government
Business and the Deputy President, and it is the Speaker who has
consistently offered extra resources to Scopa for the arms procurement
follow-up.

The hon General the Sober further alleges that the Speaker has connived
with the executive to reject the Scopa report. The executive has not
rejected the Scopa report and has no power to do so. The Scopa report,
which we passed here in this House, is a recommendation from Parliament.
They cannot reject it. The executive has not rejected it and indeed has
implemented the multipronged investigation into the arms procurement that
Scopa, and we here in the House, recommended.

The hon Holomisa wants the executive to delay the investigation whilst
Scopa draws up the terms of reference for such an investigation. Who is
delaying the investigations? One begins to wonder. But while Parliament
might recommend terms of reference for an investigation, we cannot instruct
or subcontract the executive or parts of it. So we cannot set the terms of
reference for an investigation. We might recommend certain terms.

Once again the members of the opposition want it both ways. In the name of
the separation of powers they are quick to squeal and claim that some
executive member is interfering in their work, but then they want to act as
if every committee in Parliament were a branch of the executive. They
cannot have it both ways. [Interjections.]

The hon general also accuses the Speaker of an abrupt and undemocratic
termination - I am coming to the hon Gibson now ... [Interjections] ... of
the debate on Tony Yengeni. In his letter, or rather press statement, the
general also accuses the Speaker of the abrupt and undemocratic termination
of the debate of the Tony Yengeni affair. Yet, he says, the next day the
Speaker allowed him to defend himself.

Now I can only assume that the general is referring to the proceedings of
the House on 27 March, when the hon Gibson stood up to give notice of a
motion on behalf of the DP calling on Tony Yengeni to make a simple
statement. He was then stopped by the Speaker. The Speaker said:


  I have already received a letter from you, hon Gibson, to refer this
  matter to the ethics committee, which I have done, and I am a bit
  concerned now that we are going to get things muddled up.

Mr Gibson said:


  Madam Speaker, naturally, I abide by your ruling.

[Interjections.] But then he requested the Speaker whether she would allow
him to read the last three lines of the motion notwithstanding. And showing
a lot more lenience that most of us get from the Speaker, she allowed him
to complete his motion. What the hon Gibson called for was for Mr Yengeni
to make a simple statement disclosing the details surrounding the
acquisition of his motor vehicle. [Interjections.]

The next day, as the hon Holomisa is complaining, he was allowed to make a
statement. Whether the statement satisfied him or not is a different
matter. But they cannot have it both ways. They cannot call upon the
Speaker to allow the hon Yengeni to make a statement and then complain when
she does allow him to do that. [Interjections.]

At the multiparty Whips meeting to discuss the Holomisa letter it was clear
by all accounts that the majority of opposition Whips, including the hon
Gibson, were disinclined to go charging off on an adventure with the
general. However, a few days later that changed when Tony Leon then also
plunged into the matter. Why did he do this? He did it because there is a
great nervousness, particularly on the opposition benches. They are all
watching each other and they are terrified that one or the other will steal
a march. [Interjections.]

It is plain to everyone that with all of its limited resources the PAC, or
rather the hon De Lille on her own, has out-manoeuvred the lot of them.
Single-handedly she has led the charge against the arms procurement
package. I do not say that she has talked sense. She has not. I do not say
that she has a good case. She does not. But there she is week after week on
the front pages, the darling of the liberal press, and the key spokesperson
opposing the arms deal.

How this has left the hon Tony Leon behind. How it has put his nose out of
joint. How can a party with three MPs, if one can count the other two ...
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
Amendment put.

Division demanded.

Mr M T GONIWE: Madam Speaker, just before we start the division, I want to
raise this point of order: We are debating in this House this afternoon a
matter that has been put on the agenda by Gen Holomisa. [Interjections.] He
is not here in the House. According to our information he is in the bar.
[Laughter.] We want to ask you to send some officers ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, that is not a point of order. The
hon member is wherever he is. That is a matter for his caucus to deal with.

Mr M T GONIWE: Madam Speaker, we shall vote with the red button on this.
[Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, may I have your attention? Now that
we have completed this debate, I wish to request hon members to respect
what we have done here today. I think we have indeed taken a step forward
in building our democracy and the institutions of that democracy.

We might want to pursue the debate on the Office of the Speaker, and that
is something that we still need to attend to. I just wish to emphasise,
though, that we need, as hon members, to respect the kinds of issues that
we raised here today as we proceed. Clearly, we learn as we go along. I am
saying this in order to emphasise the need for us to realise that it is
also about the respectability of this House and this Parliament.
[Applause.]

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 23 - Safety and Security, and Vote No 21 -Independent
Complaints Directorate:
The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Speaker and hon members, the
cutting edge of the Government's overall strategy to bring down the levels
of crime in our country is the SA Police Service. It is a new service,
exploring new policing policies in a new constitutional democracy that is
in the throes of transition, change and transformation.

Besides its being a new service, the environment itself in which it moves
and has its being is new. Because it is new and because it is operating in
a relatively strange terrain, it is not impossible that, at times, it fails
to rise to our ideal expectations. In fact, the service readily concedes
that it is on a learning curve.

However, determination, courage and the utter commitment to give the
criminal no quarter, is what nobody in their right mind can say those men
and women in blue lack. The criminal thugs in this country know this, and
their friends in the region, on the continent and, indeed, elsewhere in the
world, know this as well. That is precisely why they have taken the
decision to target the police for elimination.

It is my intention to dedicate this Vote to the everlasting memory of those
police officers who have sacrificed their own dear lives out of a desire to
create and sustain an environment of safety and security for all our
people. As I do so, I would also like to acknowledge the plight that has
become the lot of the families of the fallen, and to say to them, once
again, we share their grief.

At the same time, I would like to make the pertinent point that, stringent
as our laws are in connection with this type of offence and determined as
we as a department are to ensure that members operate in a relatively safe
environment, the final arbiter is our own ordinary people themselves. The
murderers and the corrupters of the police do not live on the moon. They
are individuals with names, homes and families within our communities. They
carry out the murder of police officers, sometimes in full view of members
of the public, and take cover within our communities themselves.

What is required of all of us in this House, and the rest of civil society
out there, is extensive mobilisational work amongst the ordinary people for
the exposure of police murderers. That work would of course have to
underpin the point that police officers are the physical embodiment of the
Constitution and statutes of our country, and that those who murder them
are thugs bent on subverting that Constitution and our laws.

Indeed, part of the speech will be spent in pursuit of this ideal, the
consolidation of that grand partnership between the Government and the
people against crime. This mass mobilisation campaign has already started
in Gauteng, with the emphasis being on the reduction of demand for stolen
property. It will be rolled out to other provinces in the course of the
year.

We shall pursue this campaign even more rigorously as we confront head-on
the endemic problem of gangsterism on the Cape Flats. We have deployed
hundreds of police and army officers for some time now. We have arrested
many of the gang leaders and their followers, but the problem still remains
with us.

In the meantime, gangsters are dispensing a great deal of favours to some
members of the communities. They are terrorising and, in some instances,
ingratiating themselves with well-known and respected civil and religious
personalities. Only yesterday afternoon the Minister of Defence and I were
told, right there in the community hall at Manenberg, by some members of
that community, that some of them are actually in collusion with the
murderous gangs, for the express purpose of making a living and getting
their children to school.

Whilst it is true that these areas remain economically depressed, we had
never expected that in a community that is terrorised daily by armed
bandits, people would actually rise and attempt to justify, publicly, why
some of them are working hand in glove with their very tormentors. What is
encouraging, however, is the fact that the vast majority of our people in
the affected areas refuse to surrender to the terror of the gangsters. They
have organised themselves into neighbourhood watches and other anti-crime
and anti-gang structures, to assist our drive to normalise life in our
townships.

This budget must support these noble efforts. At the same time, all three
tiers of government must fast-track their programmes to address and redress
the economic depression in these creations of the apartheid state. For our
part, as a department, we have no alternative but to intervene decisively
in all these areas of rampant criminality and gang violence, using every
piece of legislation in place to turn the tables against armed banditry and
thuggery in Manenberg and elsewhere on the Cape Flats.

I would like to invite the MEC and the City Council of Cape Town to sit
down with me, to make sure that we all contribute to a solution to the
problems of gangsterism in Manenberg and elsewhere. I will talk more about
this later. I concede readily that this is going to be a tough struggle,
given the long history of gangsterism in these areas. However, we must, all
of us, party politics aside, brace ourselves for this kind of struggle.

It might well be the case that what we are contemplating in this regard
will adversely affect the lives of decent law-abiding citizens in these
areas, but we have no choice in the circumstances, and all we can plead for
is co-operation and understanding from our people. Obviously, the methods
we have been using have not yielded the desired results.

Masixoze omnye umphini, ntozakuthi. [Let us devise other means, hon
members.]

I have stated before that firearms control is a prerequisite for a safer
society and our efforts in this regard prove that we are serious and
committed to ridding this country of the scourge of illegal firearms. The
President signed the Firearms Control Act on 10 April 2001 and regulations
in support thereof are currently being drafted. Various projects are also
being undertaken to facilitate the implementation of the Act, because as
the House knows, this was the major concern of members of this House. These
steps include: The recruitment and training of personnel and the purchase
of equipment; the revamping of the Central Firearms Register, which
includes the import/export element; the auditing of all firearms in the
possession of state departments and institutions; the destruction of all
redundant firearms in SAPS custody; and the implementation of improved
control measures at ports of entry.

An additional amount of R217 million has been allocated for the
implementation of this Act. The amount has been spread over a period of
three financial years in order to establish efficient capacity at various
levels within the SA Police Service. An amount of R57 million was allocated
for the previous financial year and R82 million for this financial year. I
will in the immediate future announce the first ``gun-free zones'' in terms
of this new Act. Areas plagued by violence involving the use of firearms
will receive priority attention in this regard. That includes the Cape
Flats.

The mobility of members is an essential and critical element in our drive
to improve service delivery. Our budget has taken that into consideration,
as we have allocated R410 million for the upgrading and modernisation of
our vehicle fleet. Out of this amount we should be able to buy
approximately 6 200 new vehicles. The distribution will be such that the
vehicle shortage in the priority areas is substantially reduced. I am
convinced that the distribution of these new vehicles over and above the
500 others that accrued from the closure of specialised units will greatly
enhance the operational capacity at police stations throughout the country.

An amount of R155 million has also been included for the erection and
purchase of police facilities. This reflects an increase of R51 million.
Complete new structures which comprise mainly police stations amount to 88
facilities, whilst additions to existing facilities amount to 320. Of the
total of 408 facilities, 224 are already being built. The significant
number of facilities to be established will benefit the working environment
of police officials and, most of all, will promote access by the public to
policing and service delivery.

The SAPS is reorganising its structures to ensure a multidisciplinary
approach to organised crime through the closure of specialised units and
the creation of organised crime units. So far, 203 specialised units have
been closed. Nine new organised crime units and 15 new units dealing with
serious and violent crimes, spread over all provinces, have been created.
Posts have been advertised for ten legal officials who will be placed at
the organised crime units to support investigating officers in ensuring
that cases are ready for court.

A total of 300 organised crime task teams will be set up by 30 June 2001 to
further strengthen our capacity to deal with identified organised crime
threats. These task teams are being set up in accordance with the organised
crime threat analysis and will focus on identified syndicates. These units
will go a long way in strengthening Operation Crackdown, which is also
being reinforced by other developments which I will describe.

An additional 50 fully-equipped crime prevention units will be established
at identified priority stations during this year. The stations where these
units are to be established have already been identified and investigations
are currently under way to determine the resource needs. These units will
be in place by the end of September 2001 and will significantly enhance the
visibility of the SA Police Service.

A new curriculum and training programme has, for the first time in the
history of the SA Police Service, been developed for crime prevention. This
programme is currently being piloted and all members involved in crime
prevention will receive the new training, with the initial focus on the
members of the 50 new crime prevention units.

A national rapid deployment stability force will be established by 31
October 2001 for deployment in all provinces. This force will be deployed
in support of local police in flashpoint areas in instances where normal
policing is not appropriate to deal with incidents of major public
disorder, serious and violent crimes and disaster management. Such
deployment will be maintained until the situation has been stabilised. The
Rapid Deployment Stability Force will be supported by the SANDF and 43 SAPS
intervention units which will operate at area level and will serve all
police areas in the country.

Air-supported reaction units are being established in Gauteng and this
capacity will be extended to the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and the
Eastern Cape by October 2001. These units will act as quick response units
to incidents of serious and violent crime, such as bank robberies, vehicle
hijackings and farm attacks. Air support will also be used for aerial
surveillance purposes.

Satellite tracking systems will be installed in all SAPS aircraft to
enhance our capacity to deal effectively with the theft and hijackings of
vehicles. The extension of this capacity is currently under investigation.
Two additional helicopters have been purchased at a cost of R25 million to
strengthen our air support capacity. An order has also been placed for two
further helicopters. Delivery is expected at the end of October this year.

A new policy on the recruitment and use of reservists has been developed
and is currently being refined. It is envisaged that it will be implemented
by July 2001. The recruitment of additional reservists in accordance with
the newly designed policy will commence immediately after approval of the
policy. A target of 30 000 reservists has been set. These reservists will
be employed, amongst other things, to strengthen crime prevention units,
implement sector policing and extend sector policing in terms of rural
safety.

The SA Police Service has not only been active in the operational field but
has also played a part in the development of an international legal
framework to combat organised and other forms of crime. The key to the
successful combating of transnational organised crime is international co-
operation.
South Africa was one of the signatories to the UN Convention on
Transnational Organised Crime, as well as the two additional protocols on
trafficking in persons and the trafficking of migrants, signed during
December 2000 in Palermo in Italy. The convention creates a complete new
framework for international co-operation to combat transnational organised
crime in all its forms through police and law enforcement co-operation.

Recognising the undisputed link between illicit firearms and crime, and the
role of illicit firearms in hampering the safety and security of
communities, the SA Police Service actively participated in the drafting of
the SADC Declaration on Firearms. This declaration lays the foundation for
co-operation in the Southern African region to combat the scourge of small
arms and light weapons. It provides, amongst other things, for the
harmonisation of legislation pertaining to firearms in the region, and for
the conclusion by August 2001 by SADC heads of state of the SADC Protocol
on Firearms, which will operationalise the SADC Declaration on Firearms
which was signed by all the heads of state of SADC on 9 May 2001. The SA
Police Service is also actively participating in the drafting and
negotiation of the SADC Protocol on Firearms, Ammunition and Related
Materials.

The SA Police Service actively participated in the negotiations on the UN
Protocol Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms,
their Parts and Components, supplementing the UN Convention against
Transnational Organised Crime.

This protocol was finalised during February 2001, and will be submitted to
the General Assembly of the United Nations for approval.

Various organisational priorities were also implemented during the year to
support operations. I wish to refer to some of the developments in this
regard. In the field of technology there are two developments in the
Criminal Record Centre which will make a substantial contribution to more
effective crime combating. They are the implementation of the Automated
Fingerprint Identification System, and the electro-magnetic process for the
retrieving of filed-out firearm numbers.

It has been recognised for a number of years that the development which
would have the most significant impact on the criminal justice system as a
whole was the procurement of an automated fingerprint identification
system, also referred to as the AFIS system. Such a system increases the
accurate search capacity of fingerprints tremendously, and reduces the time
to do searches and supply criminal records and identities to the courts and
investigators. This will help to reduce the number of awaiting-trial
prisoners.

The Criminal Record Centre is on schedule with the implementation of this
system. The national AFIS office will be operational on 24 January 2002 and
35 decentralised local Criminal Record Centres will be operational on 24
July next year. When the AFIS system is operational, information on
fingerprint matches will be available in less than 48 hours.

In view of the Government's initiatives on firearms, the Criminal Record
Centre has also embarked on a research project and subsequently implemented
a new process of retrieving filed-out numbers from stolen firearms and
firearms used to commit crimes. The implementation of the electro-magnetic
process to retrieve filed-out numbers from firearms has already produced
remarkable results. In the financial year 2000-2001 a total of 8009
firearms were analysed and approximately 60% of the filed-out numbers were
retrieved. This is a significant improvement when compared to previous
years, when a positive rate of only 28% was achieved.

The Forensic Science Laboratory is at present setting up a DNA criminal
intelligence database with the support of the European Union. The
requirements for the first phase of the database have been defined and 48
new members appointed for this purpose have undergone training. [Time

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Chairperson, when the hon Mr Tshwete was appointed
Minister of Safety and Security, we supported many of the objectives that
he outlined. We lauded him for his tough talk and his repeated warnings to
criminals. When he took office, there were high hopes that his no-nonsense
approach would breath life into the Government's losing war on crime. There
was almost as much goodwill and support for the new hon Minister from the
opposition as there was from the side of the ANC. High expectations were
created. Performance was promised and it was expected.

But the first warning signs went off on 13 January 2000, when the hon the
Minister chose to call on the police to use all methods, constitutional and
otherwise, in fighting crime. The endorsement of unconstitutional methods,
but even more, his call for the police to use these methods made many
people stop in their tracks and re-evaluate the hon the Minister's
approach. As a matter of fact, the rumblings about that controversial
statement were reported in newspapers to have come from the hon the
Minister's own colleagues in Cabinet, who apparently had warned about the
damage caused by that kind of statement. Newspapers mentioned hon Ministers
Manuel, Erwin and Asmal as having taken issue with the importance of
constitutional conduct by the police.

After that first warning sign, many others followed in quick succession. In
February 2000, hon Ministers Tshwete and Maduna said, during an American
CBS television broadcast, commenting on South African rape statistics, and
I quote:


  We have been standing here for 26 seconds and nobody has been raped.

It is hard to believe that any Minister with any understanding of our crime
situation and rape figures in this country, more than 140 rapes per day on
average, can even consider making such a statement. That was an insult to
rape victims.

In April 2000, he said that aliens were involved in most crimes. Of course
there are foreigners involved in crime, as there are South Africans
involved in crime. But to stereotype all foreigners, many of whom create
jobs in this country, and contribute to a stable society, is extremely
irresponsible. In May 2000 a report by the Institute of Security Studies
concluded that, notwithstanding all the tough talk, more violent crimes per
person took place for the first five months of 2000 than at any time since
1994. So much for the tough talk.

In July 2000, a blanket of silence was placed on crime statistics by way of
a moratorium. We were assured by the hon the Minister of the absolute
necessity of the moratorium because of the supposed inaccuracy of
statistical reporting. The recent lifting of the moratorium proved that
there was no reason for the initial moratorium. It wasted everybody's time
and nothing has changed.

In August 2000, the hon the Minister made a blanket accusation that white
women were using National Women's Day for shopping and relaxation. This
implied that white women were somehow less patriotic than other women.

In September 2000, during the height of the urban terror campaign in Cape
Town, the hon the Minister cast suspicions on the Muslim community as a
whole in reacting to the planting of bombs. In February this year, he
launched a vicious attack on the South African Portuguese community, making
sweeping generalisations about Portuguese South Africans. Also in February,
at a ceremony in the Eastern Cape, the hon the Minister announced, and I
quote:


  There are many criminals amongst us and most of them are women.

The hon the Minister later unconvincingly tried to deny that he ever said
this. Is this the conduct our people deserve and expect from a Minister? In
April of this year, we had the Mbeki plot debacle, which I will come back
to. Is this the conduct our people deserve and expect from a Minister?

Over the past two weeks, the hon the Minister has repeatedly been forced to
withdraw unparliamentary remarks, insults and gestures in a display of
parliamentary conduct which can only be described as disgraceful,
especially from a senior member of this Parliament and Cabinet. Is this the
conduct our people deserve and expect from a Minister?

When a minister has performed well or made progress, we believe that credit
must be given. There are Ministers in this Cabinet who command respect
across party-political lines, such as hon Ministers Lekota, Didiza, Manuel
and others. Even those of us who are in opposition would like to support a
person, regardless of party affiliation, if that person acts in South
Africa's interests.

But where Ministers have been negligent or ineffective, we believe in
holding them accountable, and all of us here should do so. This hon
Minister has become a national embarrassment and a liability to both this
nation and to his Government. He is not fit to serve as a member of
Cabinet, especially not as Minister of Safety and Security.

A Minister of Safety and security is somebody who should be trusted with
the immense power at his or her disposal. The people out there should know
that this is a person who will use that power wisely and with discretion,
not in a gung-ho fashion. Our police deserve better.

The hon the Minister's own Cabinet colleagues know of the damage control
that they sometimes have to do after some of his actions and statements.
Just ask hon Minister Manuel, who was in Washington at the time of the so-
called plot announcement.

But let us return to what I think was the most disastrous, but also the
most ominous incident during this Minister's reign, and that is the so-
called Mbeki plot. On 11 November 2000, we discussed in this House, during
a debate on the Scorpions, the danger of unregulated police power. During
that debate I said the following:


  The question is not if Mr Mbeki or Mr Tshwete or Mr Maduna have
  intentions at present to abuse the situation. We presently have no reason
  to question their motives. The question is: Do we want to create a
  situation where future political leaders, even if it is two or five or
  ten years from now, may succumb to the temptation to abuse their power?
  Some people in the present Government may say, ``trust us''.

I then referred to the United States, and how in their democracy the FBI
was abused to investigate opposition as well as government members during
the J Edgar Hoover saga. It took us a mere six months to see the same
happening here.

ANC members may shout, and they may try to rally around Mr Tshwete - there
are fewer of them every day - but deep down the responsible ANC members
know that the so-called plot was an abuse of power that should never have
happened. We also know that if this pattern continues, it will become a
huge weapon of intimidation, where members of the governing party are the
most vulnerable - just ask Mr Ramaphosa, Mr Sexwale and Mr Phosa.

Our impression was - and we have received no information to change our
impressions - that allegations against those three gentlemen were a clumsy
attempt by the Minister and some other senior ANC leaders to cause
political damage to those three potential contenders for leadership
positions within the ANC. Our impression still is that the excuse that it
was rumours about the President's involvement in Chris Hani's murder is a
very unconvincing smokescreen. The Minister's contemptuous attitude towards
the portfolio committee and Parliament only reinforced our impressions and
suspicions, and did not alleviate them in any way.

To prove the point: During question time last week, the President admitted
that up to then, the police had not approached him to make any statement on
the issue. If that was the reason for the investigation, how is it possible
that no statement has been taken from the central figure in the
allegations? It does not make sense, and it reinforces the impression that
when the first plot allegation backfired, a second fig leaf was
manufactured.

Let me quote from a news report of 1998:


  Last month, General Meiring told Mr Mandela about an alleged plot by
  senior military officers and ANC officials to overthrow the Government.
  His report was based on information by a single individual. Mr Mandela
  was furious that General Meiring used his access to him to bypass the
  Defence Minister Joe Modise. He also was angry that General Meiring
  presented him with untested and unverified information. South African
  President Nelson Mandela has accepted the resignation of the country's
  National Defence Force Chief.

I suggest that that is what the hon the Minister should also have done. In
this event, Minister Tshwete has proved that he does not have the good
judgment to be trusted with power in a key Government position. He showed
all the characteristics of someone who would sacrifice democratic
principles and good government for internal party-political power
struggles.

In conclusion, in his question time two weeks ago, Minister Tshwete
mentioned John Vorster. This is ironic since it is this hon Minister who
has taken on the worst elements of John Vorster in the new South Africa. We
urge the President, the ANC and its leadership to rid the Cabinet of hon
Minister Steve Tshwete for the sake of the credibility of this Government.
The Minister is an embarrassing failure. For the sake of the country, he
must go - and go now. [Applause.]

Mr M E GEORGE: Comrade Chairperson, Minister Tshwete, hon members, I will
be lying if I say that I am disappointed with the last speaker. He is so
predictable that he did exactly what I expected of him. He never talked
about crime, which is the biggest challenge facing this country. All he did
was to misuse this podium to list a catalogue of criminal acts against the
Minister of Safety and Security. He was so happy, and he got so carried
away, that he even forgot that this country faces a big challenge, that is,
to fight crime and to make sure that the citizens of this country are
protected.

He made no contribution regarding how we can fight crime in this country -
typical of the Democratic Alliance. All they are good at is to behave as if
they were foreigners. They have no contribution to make in building
democracy in this country. So, I am appealing to Mr Van Schalkwyk - I know
he is very young and new in politics - to develop to a level where he will
be able to debate with us in this august House. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: He is useless!
Mr M E GEORGE: I stand here to add my voice in support of this budget. The
ANC supports this budget because it believes that it is reasonably adequate
for the SAPS to carry out its tasks of preventing crime and dealing
vigorously with crime in our country. I use the term ``reasonably
adequate'' because there is no such thing as enough money, especially for
developing countries such as South Africa. What then becomes very important
for the police management is to prioritise those areas which are strategic
and critical in fighting crime. This means, like we said to them in the
portfolio committee, that their budget must be informed by the policing
priorities of the department. It means we must be linked to moneys spent
and priorities.

It is for this reason that the top management of the SAPS have, during the
first three months of 2000, gone through an extensive process of strategic
planning during which the priorities of the SAPS were reviewed in terms of
Government policy, the National Intelligence estimates and crime
information, and crime pattern analysis. This was an important step in the
right direction. The National Commissioner should keep it up!

The levels of violent crime and violence against women and children are
completely unacceptable. It is a pity that again Mr Van Schalkwyk did not
even bother to talk about those problems. He was more concerned about
attacking the Minister, trying to prescribe to the ANC who should be the
Minister, and who should not. Some crimes, as I will indicate below, might
be stabilising or on the decrease but they remain at unacceptable levels.

For the success of the SA Police Service, we need the involvement of all
people in this Chamber and all departments, especially Justice, Social
Development, Health, Home Affairs, Correctional Services and the SA
National Defence Force. The approach of the National Commissioner to
dealing with organised crime must be supported and applauded by everybody.
The National Commissioner is right when he says that people who are
involved in drugs will not go to a garage to buy a car to carry drugs; they
steal them or take them by force in hijackings. They do not go to firearms
dealers to buy firearms, they use illegal firearms, and so forth.

Doing away with some specialised units makes a lot of sense and leads to
our limited resources being used to the maximum. Specialised units to deal
with family violence, child protection and sexual abuse have been
strengthened to enhance the SA Police Service's capacity to deal with
crimes against women and children, as one of the speakers will show. They
have not been dissolved or done away with, as our detractors would like
people to believe.

Before I deal with farm murders, police murders and corruption within the
Police Service, I want to urge the National Commissioner and his management
to adhere to the priorities that they listed in their budget briefing to
the portfolio committee because they make a lot of good sense and, if they
did what they said they were going to do, it will be good for the country.

It is very painful and unfortunate that some opposition parties would stoop
to the level of using attacks on farms and smallholdings and the murder of
farmers to score cheap political points. I say it is painful because
farmers are an important component of our society and country, not only
because they are human beings but because they play a major role in
economic development. [Interjections.]

That is why the Government and particularly the President take the issue of
rural safety very seriously. A presidential working committee on
agriculture, which meets on a quarterly basis, was established under the
guidance of the President. This working committee deals with agricultural
issues in general, but also focuses on security issues.
Compared to 1999 incidents of attacks on farms and smallholdings stabilised
during 2000, with an insignificantly small increase which is still
unacceptable. Almost all provinces were affected, with the exception of the
Nothern Province, the Free State and the Northern Cape. The number of
murders committed during farm attacks decreased slightly in KwaZulu-Natal,
the Northern Cape and the Free State. In all, the Government is doing
everything to stop these cowardly acts of violence against farmers, and the
rural safety plan is being implemented.

The number of police killed in South Africa, clearly shows that there is
lack of respect for the police by the community. Again, this is something
that we must all fight against. A larger number, which is 64%, of police
are murdered off duty, though a significant number of about 35,5% are
killed while carrying out arrests. Some are killed due to negligence, like
not wearing bulletproof vests or not concealing their firearms in social
gatherings. That still does not justify any citizen of this country killing
police officers.

I wish to make a call to the media, that killing of police officers must be
made headlines in all South African newspapers. All our media formations
should make the killing of police officers a very big issue because it is a
serious offence.
Abantu bakowethu bamele ukuba basebenzisane namapolisa ukulwa obu bugebenga
nobu bundlobongela. Amaxesha amaninzi amapolisa abulawelwa imipu yawo
zizigebenga ezifuna ukwenza intlondi. Sicela abantu ababone abenza lo
mkhuba mbi, baxelele amapolisa akufuphi ngoba ezi zigebenga zizimela apha
kwezi ndawo sihlala kuzo. NoMkomishinala weLizwe ndiyamcela, umntakwethu,
ukuba azame noko ukuba ezi zinxibo zawo zikhusela imizimba kwiimbumbulu,
zibe ngathi ziyaphucuka. Amapolisa esidibene nawo athi noko izinxibo zeziya
zakudala, zenza ke ngoku azinxibeki. Kwakufuneka ke umntakwethu azame into
yokokuba zibe kumgangatho ongcono. Noko olu lwabiwo-mali ngathi alulubanga
kakhulu.

Oomantyi neejaji kufuneka noko xa umntu ethe wafunyanwa enetyala lokubulala
ipolisa, akahlale entolongweni ade afele apho. Nawo ke amapolisa, kuza
kufuneka into yokokuba asincedise kule ndawo, asebenzisane nabantu
ukwenzela into yokuba sikwazi ukuwakhusela. Ubuqhophololo ke,
ukunganyaniseki nokungawukhathaleli umsebenzi wawo yenye yezinto ezixhomisa
amehlo apha kumapolisa. (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Our people should work together with the police to fight crime. In most
instances, police get killed by criminals who want to take their firearms
and use them in criminal activities. We ask that people who witness these
criminal acts, should report them to the nearest police station. I would
also like to plead with my brother, the National Police Commissioner, to
get new bulletproof vests that are of a better standard. Police we have
met, complain that the ones that they use now are old and are not easy and
comfortable to wear. I think that the budget is not that bad and should
allow for that.

Magistrates and judges should sentence a person who has been found guilty
of killing a police official to life imprisonment. The police should co-
operate with the people so that we can protect them too. Fraud and
misconduct are some of the things that should be taken care of, as they are
rife among the police.]

Some police are involved in all sorts of corrupt practices, like fraud,
theft, sexual harassment, abuse of state assets, power and authority. I
congratulate the Minister on the new vehicles that are going to be bought,
and I hope that those vehicles are not going to be seen parked in front of
shebeens or some police official's house. [Interjections.]

Of course, we must accept that the SAPS Strategic Plan for 2000-2003
prioritises corruption or more broadly put the issues of integrity, as a
factor central to undermining the standard of policing service which is
delivered by the SAPS to the people of this country. This must be applauded
and commended, but time is of the essence.

The fact that corruption within the SAPS has been prioritised within the
SAPS Strategic Plan 2000-2003, and that the SAPS has developed a corruption
strategy, emphasises the department's commitment to eradicating corruption
within its ranks. So, the National Commissioner should keep it up. I must
emphasise, before I pass on from this point, that it is not all the police
officers in the SAPS that are corrupt. In actual fact, many police officers
are not corrupt, but those few police that are corrupt damage the image of
the SAPS.

For the police to be effective in their fight against crime they must be
transformed more quickly. It is important that police stations in black
areas are as equipped as those in white areas. We have been saying this for
the past seven years, though I must say that there have been some
improvements, but the changes are taking place at a snail's pace.

Racism is still rampant in the Police Service, especially in the Western
Cape, where Popcru even complained to the portfolio committee. The
provincial commissioner of the Western Cape was given an opportunity to
respond. Up to now, he has not come back to us.

The ANC-led Government is committed to clean service, because it realises
that a police service riddled with corruption and racism will not be as
effective as it should be. Various structures, such as the secretariat, the
ICD, and the anticorruption unit are working hard to achieve these
objectives. I am getting worried, because I would have liked to talk about
the secretariat and say to the Minister that that structure is very much
needed by the police too, for transformation. But something must be done to
make sure that it does what it was meant for.

I also wish to appeal to the Minister to see to it that the ICD is provided
with enough resources to carry out its functions. I know that the Minister
likes them, but I am asking him to do something to make sure that they get
more money to perform their functions.

As I have said, the secretariat, which has recently been reinforced with
new appointments, must realise that they have a constitutional
responsibility. They must strengthen the hand of the Minister and play a
vigorous role in the transformation of the service.

With unity in action against crime, crime can be defeated. I appeal to the
DA and its friends that we should all close ranks, as South Africans, to
fight crime. This is in line with the call made by the President in his
state of the nation address - a call for unity in action. Let us all join
hands and forget about what Mr Van Schalkwyk said. It is his nature to say
such things, but let us all unite and fight crime. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I am sure you will be
aware that it is unparliamentary, for all of you, to read newspapers openly
in this House. Please, do not read newspapers here. You have reading rooms
and you can go there. As I am sitting here, I can see all of you reading
newspapers. [Interjections.] Hon P Smith, please close that newspaper.

Mr V B NDLOVU: Sihlalo, neNdlu ehloniphekile, mhlonishwa uNgqongqoshe
[Madam Speaker, honourable House, hon Minister] there are critical issues
that the department should look at and work around in order to eliminate
some perceptions that are there. When the SAPS cannot work around the clock
to eliminate the drug lords, here in the Western Cape, people will really
be suspicious about their involvement.

If the police are involved in car hijackings and bank robberies, people
will not trust them. A case in point is the SBV case in Durban. When the
police are not helping the business community to apprehend the criminals
who terrorise innocent people in KwaNongoma, Hluhluwe, Ulundi, Qunu, Mt
Frere and Mt Ayliff, people will not trust them. When members of the VIP
Protection Unit are involved in car robberies and top officials in Durban
are suspended and fired because of their involvement in these robberies,
people will always have questions about the police.

If the police are not helping the victims, including abused women and
children, and are even involved in chasing the victims away when they come
to open cases at the police station, and even rape them at the police
station where they are supposed to protect them, the Domestic Violence Act
will always be seen not to be effective.

Against this background the IFP observed the following: As long as the
police are killed because their dogs are making a noise, racism will be
with us. Whenever police are killed when apprehending criminals and the
justice system is seen to be lenient to criminals, the image of the police
will diminish. Whenever there are trustworthy police members who find
themselves grouped together with corrupt ones they will not be different.
This is not fair to the police; it dampens their spirit. To kill a police
member should be seen as tampering with or attacking the Constitution of
the country itself. I am referring to those police members who are innocent
and who are killed on duty.

The work of the police is to protect the citizens of this country without
fail. If the police are failing to protect the citizens of this country the
state has to find the reason for such behaviour and accordingly deal with
those reasons as a matter of urgency.

The department should make sure that promotions occur within the
department, and racial discrimination should be targeted whenever it
affects police promotion. The department should always offer psychological
assistance to members of the police and make it statutory in order to
eliminate job-related stress, as police have to contend with cases ranging
from domestic violence to murder, robbery, heists, etc. The department
should do away with the suspension of members for more than one year
because that is a waste of money and human resources. This defeats the very
purpose of combating crime.

While the state is looking for ways to redress the problem in order to
assist the police in arresting the criminals and diligently executing their
duty, we, the law-abiding citizens of this country, should help the police
in their investigations. Let us report what we know about crimes. Let us
tell the police who did what, where, when and why. Let us stop buying
stolen goods from criminals. Let us isolate the criminals from innocent
people and let us identify them once and for all.

The Department of Safety and Security should make itself available to all
municipalities that want to establish local police, including district
council policing, in conjunction with provinces by way of offering support
and technical assistance when needed. The establishment of local police at
municipality and district levels is a major step in order to fight crime.
Those are the police members who will relieve the national police in the
investigation of petty crime, to allow them to concentrate on syndicates
and commercial crimes.

When the IFP proposed the amendment of the South African Constitution to
devolve the powers of the police to the provinces we were thinking along
these lines, so as to make sure that the local police do function properly.
We as a party knew that we could not expect SAPS members to arrest those
who smoke in public.

In the department's future budget there should be an item for municipality
and district police. The department must take strong action against police
officials that are found to be involved in crime. The Department of Justice
must make sure that members of the community who are involved in killing
police officials are not handled with kid gloves.

The IFP welcomes the little increment that is afforded to the police. We
hope this will encourage them to work hard to fight criminals. The IFP
welcomes the National Commissioner's point of view that members of the
police must not take democracy too far, as well as his acceleration of
transformation within the service.

Transformation should be carried out at station level, so that qualified
members will be able to occupy the relevant positions at station level. The
IFP does not support tokenism in all spheres of government. We want to see
a true reflection of population demographics in all spheres of government.
The National Commissioner must strongly advise his colleagues against
taking the station vehicles home, because this impoverishes the station and
officers manning the station at a particular time. Some means must be
initiated to discourage this behaviour. The vehicles are there to service
the public.

The relationship between the Scorpions and the SAPS members is being looked
at at committee level. The members will not sit back when they know that
their competition is not healthy. The behaviour of some members of the
Scorpions towards the police is noted with concern. The perception and
image that exist of these two components of the police are known to us. The
quicker we solve this problem the better it will be for us all.

The IFP is concerned at seeing well-trained members manning the gates. We
want to see well-trained police taking up their posts in the police and
being removed from the gates, and the gates being guarded by people who are
specifically trained to do so. The IFP would like to see the public
servants who work under the police being under the Police Act instead of
having two or three separate rules applied in one station.

The National Commissioner should start negotiations on this matter. The IFP
is appealing for all public servants employed within the service to fall
under the Police Act. The co-ordination should start from the employment
agreement up, to the benefit of the members themselves.

The training of SAPS members has to be improved to incorporate knowledge of
the Constitution, especially the Bill of Rights. As the police are the
mirror of the country, they should be equipped to know the social politics
of the country without being partisan when implementing it. The Department
of Safety and Security must empower the police, especially because the
National Commissioner is a civilian.

We welcome the fact that the Safety and Security budget of 2001-02 has
increased by R1,4 billion. This demonstrates the Government's commitment to
fighting crime. The fact that crime prevention received the biggest slice
of the increase, almost R700 million, is encouraging and it shows that the
Government has realised that prevention is better than cure. It is true
that crime prevention has a fundamental role to play as the knock-on
effects on the entire justice system are well known. The burden of this
system would undoubtedly be lessened if more crime was prevented rather
than just reacted to.

It is also encouraging to see that spending on the detective service and
crime intelligence will be increased by R420 million. It has been alleged
that South African detectives are not as well trained as those of other
countries. Hopefully, the R52 million allocated to the detective academy
will address this perception strongly. The IFP will support this budget.

We have to look carefully at what the ICD mandate is all about and we have
to make sure that the ICD sticks to its mandate, and also make sure that
its mandate is working. The important thing is that the ICD works under
undesirable pressure and a limited budget and resources. The backlog of
cases that are supposed to be investigated are piling up. The workload of
each investigator will always give stress to the individual people
involved. The number of cases referred back to the police for further
investigation when initially these cases are reported to the ICD removes
the capacity of the ICD to be independent.

The nonco-operativeness of the Department of Public Works in respect of the
ICD compounds the problem that the ICD faces as an organ of state. The
nonavailability of offices is problematic. We need to do something to make
sure that we facilitate assistance in this regard. The IFP would therefore
like to propose that the Ministry must give enough funding to this section
of its department.

The ICD therefore must make sure that it works independently without
referring cases to the police, because those cases are referred to the ICD
from the police themselves. [Time expired.]

Miss J E SOSIBO: Mr Chairperson ...

Mr D M BAKKER: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: I think we all regard
this debate as being tremendously important in the light of the crime
situation in our country. But we note that there is one out of almost 30
Cabinet members in Parliament, and the worse part is that there is not even
a quorum in this Chamber for this debate to take place. I think that is
shocking.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That is not a point of order any way.
We note your statement, but that is not a point of order.

Mr D M BAKKER: Mr Chairperson, in terms of the Rules I am raising a point
of order that the members in this House do not constitute a quorum. The
Rules are very specific in that regard.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Okay!

Miss J E SOSIBO: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members of
Parliament, the ANC welcomes and appreciates the increased budget for
Safety and Security for the year 2001-02.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Mr Chairperson, I am so sorry. If a point of order is
being taken about a quorum, proceedings cannot just carry on as though the
point of order has not been taken.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I have already ordered the Table to
count and report to me. I will come back to that.

Miss J E SOSIBO: Chairperson, the fact that Safety and Security has set
down crime priorities in terms of their strategic focus, namely, organised
crime, serious and violent crimes, crimes against women and children, and
improving service delivery, is applauded.

Sihlalo, thina bakaKhongolose siyawubona umsebenzi owenziwe nguMnyango
wokuPhepha nokuVikela ekulweni nobugebengu kanye nodlame. Lokhu asikufundi
emaphepheni. Asifundi ngazo lezi zinto, futhi asizizwa ngalabo abazenza
ongoti kwezokuphepha nokuvikela.
Thina njengamalungu ePhalamende aseKomidini yezokuPhepha nokuVikela,
umsebenzi wethu ngukuqinisekisa ukuthi umsebenzi wokulwa nobugebengu
nodlame uyenziwa. Sisebenzela futhi ukuthi siqiniseke ukuthi
izinsizakusebenza zokwenza lo msebenzi zikhona, ziyatholakala
zisetshenziswe njengoba kulindelekile. Yingakho nje sithi umsebenzi
kaNgqongqoshe noMnyango wakhe siyawubona futhi uyancomeka.

Ngithanda ukusebenzisa leli thuba ukubonga uNgqongqoshe, uMphathi
wamaPhoyisa uKhomishana uJackie Selebe, ngokukhuphula umholo wamaphoyisa
kulo nyaka. Isinqumo sokwenyusa umholo emaphoyiseni sifike ngesikhathi
esifaneleyo lapho amaphoyisa ehlaselwa futhi ebulawa yizigebengu, ngoba
ezixakile emsebenzini wazo. Sinethemba ukuthi le miholo izofaka umdlandla
emaphoyiseni ukuze kuliwe nobugebengu.

Okubalulekile kithi ngukuthi amaphoyisa elekelelwe ngumphakathi ekulweni
nezigebengu. Kubalulekile kakhulu ukulekekelelwa kwamaphoyisa ngumphakathi
ngohlelo lwe-community policing ukuze kunciphe izinga lobugebengu, kwehle
nodlame.

Sikuthokozele kakhulu ukukhishwa kwezibalo zobugebengu ukuze umphakathi
kanye nathi siqonde ukuthi ubugebengu buyehla noma buyenyuka na. Ukukhishwa
kwalezi zibalo ngaphambili bekungezuveza lesi sithombe esinaso manje, ngoba
bezingashayi emhlolweni. Bezenyelisa ngisho namaphoyisa emizameni yawo
engaka emsebenzini wawo. Bezenza kube sengathi awenzi lutho. Sibonile-ke
ukuthi cha nokho luyehla udlame nobugebengu.

Impi yokulwa nodlame nobugebengu yinto ephambili kakhulu kuHulumeni wethu.
Yingakho nje sithi kusekuningi okufanele sikwenze. Nakuba izibalo mayelana
nobugebengu ezikhishiwe kabusha nje zikhomba ukuthi udlame luyehla,
sekukhona ezinye izinhlobo zobugebengu ezisephezulu ngokwamanani. Lapha
singabala ukuphangwa kwezimoto, kwamabhange, kwabantu nezimoto ezithwala
imali kanye nokubulawa kwabalimi. Lolu khondolo lukhombisa ukuthi lolu
hlobo lobugebengu luphethwe ngongqondongqondo bezigebengu abacupha yonke
imigoga abangabambeka ngayo.

Siphakamisa-ke kuNgqongqoshe ukuthi amaphoyisa anikwe izinto zokusebenza
eziphilayo futhi ezanele. Siyethemba ukuthi isabelomali salo Mnyango
sonyaka ka-2001-2002 sizosiza uNgqongqoshe noKhomishana wamaPhoyisa kanye
namaphoyisa jikelele ekunqandeni udlame ezindaweni oludlange kuzo. Lapho
ngifisa ukubala izindawo ezinjengePitoli, iGoli kanye ne-Cape Flats lapho
udlame lwemigulukudu luthathe imiphefumulo yabantu abangenacala
nabangahlangene nempi yale migulukudu. Ukunqotshwa kodlame e-Cape Flats
kufanele kube ngomunye wemigomo ephambili kulo Mnyango kulo nyaka.
Ukunqotshwa kwale migulukudu ekulesi sifunda kumele kuhambisane nohlelo
lokulwa nokuhwebelana ngezidakamizwa ezingekho emthethweni.

KuMhlonishwa uNgqongqoshe kanye noKhomishana mangisho ukuthi iKapa ikakhulu
e-Sea Point, seliphenduke isidleke semigulukudu ehweba ngezidakamizwa
nalaba abadayisa imizimba kanye nabafanyana abasetshenziswa ukuthengisa
izidakamizwa ngoba bengasebenzi.

Ingosi yamaphoyisa ikhombisa ukuthi sibhekene nebhomu elingaqhuma noma
nini. Maduze nje i-Sea Point izoba nezinkinga ezifana nezase-Hillbrow.
(Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Madam Speaker, we in the ANC appreciate the work that has been done by the
Department of Safety and Security in combating crime and violence. We do
not hear about this from newspapers. We do not learn about these things and
we do not hear from those who call themselves experts in safety and
security.

Our task as members of Parliament in the Portfolio Committee on Safety and
Security is to ensure that the work of fighting crime and violence is done.
We are working to ensure that equipment to do the work is available and is
used as expected. That is why we appreciate the work that has been done by
the Minister and his department.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister and
Commissioner Jackie Selebi for increasing the salaries of the police this
year. This decision came at an appropriate time, when police are attacked
and killed by criminals because they are focusing on the work they are
doing. We hope that these salary increases will motivate the police in
their fight against crime.

What is important to us is that the community, in combating crime, should
assist the police. It is important that the police are assisted by the
community through the community-policing programme so as to reduce crime
and violence.

We are glad about the release of crime statistics so that the community and
we will know whether crime is decreasing or increasing. If these statistics
were released earlier on, they would not have given the picture that we
have now, because they were incorrect. They demotivated even the Police in
their great endeavours. They sketched the picture that the Police were not
doing their job. We have seen that in fact crime and violence are
decreasing.

The fight against crime and violence is an important thing to our
Government. That is why we say there is still a lot to be done. Although
the latest statistics show that violence is decreasing, other types of
crime are high in number. Here we can mention car hijacking, bank robbery,
robbing of people and cars that transport money and the killing of farmers.
This shows that highly intelligent criminals, who avoid all the routes
through which they could be trapped, plan these crimes.

We would like to suggest to the Minister that police should be given
adequate and appropriate equipment. We hope that the budget of this
department for 2001-2002 will help the Minister, the Commissioner and the
police force in general to fight violence in places where it is prevailing.
Here I want to mention places like Pretoria, Johannesburg and the Cape
Flats, where gangsterism has taken the lives of innocent people. Putting a
stop to violence on the Cape flats should be one of the primary policies of
our Government this year. Defeating these gangsters in this province should
go hand in hand with the plan to fight drug trafficking and trading in
other illegal substances.
I would like to say to the Minister and the Commissioner that Cape Town,
especially the Sea Point area, has become a place of gangsters who trade in
drugs. It is also a place of sex workers and boys who are used to sell
drugs because they are unemployed.

The police unit shows that we are facing a bomb that can explode at any
time. Very soon the Sea Point area is going to have problems similar to
those of Hillbrow.]

We need to act now if we want to stop the time bomb that is expected to
explode in this area where international drug lords have taken over.

Ngingakahlali phansi, ngithanda ukugcizelela ukubaluleka kokuthi sonke
sisebenzisane noMnyango wezokuPhepha nokuVikela ekulweni nobugebengu
nodlame. Ngifisa nokugcizelela ukuthi imisebenzi yakhe uNgqongqoshe
noMnyango wakhe siyayibona nakuba kukhona abanye abangathandi ukuyibona.
Thina njengoKhongolose sizimisele ukuthi sisebenzisane namaphoyisa,
siwasize ekulweni nodlame nobugebengu. Ngokunjalo, sinxusa umphakathi wonke
ukuthi kubanjiswane, udlame nobugebengu akuyona into yomuntu oyedwa
angakwazi ukuyinqanda eyedwa, kepha ngokubambisana sonke singakwazi
ukukunqanda. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)
[Before I sit down I would like to emphasise that we should all work
together with the Ministry of Safety and Security in fighting crime and
violence. I would like to emphasise also that we really appreciate the work
of the Minister and his department, although there are those who do not
want to appreciate it. We, as the ANC, are prepared to work with the police
and to help them fight crime and violence. Likewise, we ask the community
to join us. Fighting crime and violence is not something that can be done
by one person, but together we can.]

The unacceptably high level of serious and violent crime in the country is
a matter of great concern to all of us. That is why we will support him all
the way, because we know better what the needs of our people are. We do not
need any DA so-called political and crime analysts to tell us whether crime
is increasing or decreasing. We are in Government, we have access to
information and not the opposition. We will triumph in the victory against
crime.

Sizonqoba! Ngiyabonga. [We will win! Thank you.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Adv Bakker and hon Gibson, the
counting has been completed, and we do have a quorum.
Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, it is a great relief.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you.

Adv A H GAUM: Chairperson, the DA is not negative about South Africa. We
are positive that our future can be a prosperous and a peaceful one - this
is our vision and our goal. But we also realise that our peaceloving people
are under serious and constant attack. We enter this debate today against a
backdrop of the latest crime statistics that have finally been released.
For 18 months South Africans have been victims of Minister Tshwete's
information blackout which did not allow them to know where the crime
hotspots were. The moratorium has made people feel less safe rather than
more safe. And the latest statistics have given them little hope that the
battle is being won.

Today South Africans know that they are more likely than before to become a
victim of robbery, assault and housebreaking. They know that South Africa
is more violent than ever before. They, too, share our gratitude that for
now some other crime trends have stabilised, but they take little comfort
from the fact that this only means that they are just as bad off as before.
They want to know from the Minister what happened to his promise of
ruthless action against criminals. What happened to his warning to
criminals that their time was up.

Hulle wil weet wat geword het van sy belofte gedurende verlede jaar se
debat dat hy misdadigers sal ``gas gee''. [They want to know what happened
to his promise in last year's debate that he would give criminals blazes.]

The people of South Africa are tired of living in the crime capital of the
world. They are tired of being prisoners in their homes, while criminals
have the freedom to do as they please. People are tired of hollow promises
and they demand delivery. Perhaps the Minister has erred. Perhaps the
Minister realises that there is a dedicated shift in the public mood from
despair to anger, which threatens to explode if his Government does not get
crime under control. Perhaps the Minister realises that South Africans
appear to be more willing to take the law into their own hands. Does the
Minister realise that it is the state's responsibility to safeguard the
community and that he must take the blame for failing in his duty?

An HSRC survey found that 40% of South Africans believe that the Government
has no degree of control over the crime situation in our country. The loss
of confidence in the state's ability to guarantee people's safety is a
serious threat to our democratic order. The public wants to know from the
hon Minister why the police are unable to do the work they have been set to
do. They want to know why there is still such a shocking shortage of police
officers, vehicles and other resources at our police stations.

The DA's audit of police stations has revealed that we have a crippled
police service. At Mmabatho police station, there are three more detectives
this year than there were last year, but the average caseload per detective
has increased from around 30 cases to almost 70 cases. Much like the budget
increase of 8,9% makes no provision for inflation, the improvements that
are taking place do not take account of the fact that levels of crime are
also increasing.

In view of the fact that the Commissioner of Police refused to unveil
numbers of police shortages last week, we challenge the Minister to
acknowledge the severe shortages at police stations and to acknowledge the
glaring deficiencies in this budget.

The dismal situation we have is, in a nutshell the following: The
Government disregarded the staff complement of the 10 police forces of the
former TBVC states, or homelands, when tabling its first budget for the
consolidated SA Police Service. They then calculated that we needed 160 000
police officers, but reduced this number, without any explanation, to 127
000.

Today we have only 122 000 police officers. This budget only provides for a
personnel increase of 1 000 members during the coming financial year. This
will mean that the Western Cape, for instance, will be entitled to 111 of
these new posts, while it loses 500 members every year. [Interjections.]

Given these personnel shortages, it is not surprising that crime has spun
out of control. We need a dramatic increase in the recruitment of new
members, an increase that this budget will clearly not provide. We also
need the equipment and resources required for this vital service. Unless
this is provided, the people can only conclude that this Government is not
really serious about crime.

The DA has identified shortages at police stations, but these are shortages
that the Minister is well aware of. Even the Minister's own figures,
contained in an answer to one of my recent questions, portray a sad, but
widespread, story. At virtually all metropolitan police stations in this
country, there are shortages of police vehicles. The Chatsworth station in
Durban has a shortage of 27 vehicles. In Johannesburg, the Booysens station
has a shortage of 60 vehicles and Johannesburg Central has a staggering
shortage of 119 vehicles. Pretoria Central has a shortage of 75 vehicles.
In Vulindlela in East London, the lowest kilometre reading is 160 000 km,
while it is 182 000 km at Radio Control in Port Elizabeth. At CR Swart
Square, there is a vehicle with 790 000 km on the clock.

How can we expect from our police officers to effectively fight crime under
these conditions? No wonder that more than 4 000 police officers left the
service last year. How can we tolerate the fact that almost 7 000 members
are illiterate and that very little is being done to remedy this?
[Interjections.]

How can we expect detectives to solve crime when many of them receive only
a crash course in investigative skills? None of the detectives at the
kwaMashu or Orlando police station have trained at the detective academy.
How can we expect them to investigate and solve crimes when the average
caseload per detective is 120 dockets at kwaMashu. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members must please
contain their excitement. Please proceed, hon member.

Adv A H GAUM: At Alexandra police station there are 15 000 cases
outstanding.

At virtually all police stations one visits, members of the SAPS will tell
one that if this Government would only give them the staff support and the
tools they need, they would be able to do the job. This is a plea from the
police, but today it is the demand from the public. This is a demand that
clearly does not get the attention it deserves in this budget.

The only people in this country who would welcome this budget, are the
criminals themselves. Unlike President Mbeki's ``quiet diplomacy''
approach, the Minister prefers talking tough. However, the effects of both
are the same. Criminals carry on as they please. Such an inadequate budget
fails those victims quoted in the Minister's statistics, it fails their
families and communities and it fails the country.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, are you rising on
a point of order?

Mr M E GEORGE: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it parliamentary to
call members of Parliament criminals? [Interjections.] The hon member said
that people who welcome this budget are criminals, and we have said that we
welcome this budget. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member at the podium,
would you please clarify what you said. Can you just refer to that part? We
will give you the time. Just look at that part quickly.

Adv A H GAUM: What I said is that the only people in this country who would
welcome this budget are the criminals themselves, because it is an
inadequate budget. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I think that that is perfectly
in order, you can carry on, hon member.

Adv A H GAUM: Thank you. I would like to tell the hon Minister that these
are people like former commissioner George Fivaz and Advocate George Bizos.

Dit is mense soos Jannie en Annelise Visser van die plaas Luiperdskloof
naby Ceres, wat vanoggend begrawe is. Het dit nie tyd geword dat die
barbare wat weerlose mense op plase vermoor straf kry wat by hierdie dade
pas nie? [Tussenwerpsels.]

'n ANC parlementslid het verlede Sondag die swaarste straf vir die Ceres-
booswigte bepleit. Gaan sy partygenote hom nou kruisig of dink hulle dalk
ook dit het tyd geword om ons af te vra of ons huidige strawwe werklik by
die wreedste vorms van misdaad pas. Voel die meerderheid lede in dié Huis
werklik dat die doodstraf uit die bose is wanneer 'n boer of plaaswerker
weerloos en afgesonder wreedaardig vermoor word? [Tussenwerpsels.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs folows.)

[These are people like Jannie and Annelise Visser of the farm Luiperdskloof
near Ceres, who were buried this morning. Is it not time that the savages
who murder defenceless people on farms receive a punishment appropriate to
these crimes? [Interjections.]

Last Sunday an ANC member of Parliament pleaded for the most severe
punishment for the villains from Ceres. Are his fellow party members now
going to crucify him or do they also think it is about time for us to ask
whether current forms of punishment really befit the most brutal types of
crime? Do the majority of members in this House really believe that the
death penalty is out of the question when a defenceless and isolated farmer
or farm labourer is brutally murdered? [Interjections.]]

But, instead of empowering the police to fight crime and catch criminals,
we have a Minister who shoots his mouth off at every opportunity. When he
is not targeting the Portuguese community or women, he is implicating three
of our most distinguished businessmen as plotting to overthrow President
Mbeki. When straightforward questions pertaining to this plot are put to
him, the Minister brushes them aside and resorts to insulting those asking
questions and calls them cowards, spies and liars.

Mr T R MOFOKENG: Chairperson, on a point of order: I may not have got it
clear but I understood the speaker to say that all those who accepted this
budget were criminals. [Interjections.] He did repeat that. What I am
saying is that we, as the ANC, have adopted and accepted it. So, was he
referring to us?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, you are making the
same point that the hon George made. I think that I indicated that, having
asked the member at the podium to explain what he had said when he had
referred to that, it was perfectly within the bounds of parliamentary
practice. Unless there is some additional or different point on that, I
think that I have cleared it already.

Adv A H GAUM: Chairperson, I would like to ask the hon Minister if he
realises that he is becoming an embarrassment to Parliament, the police and
his own party, or is he too hard-headed to understand this?
[Interjections.] Does he really think that South Africans are so stupid as
to believe that he has won a debate when they see him waving his fists in
Parliament and shouting at our benches without answering simple questions,
simple questions that even a child would understand, such as, whether case
dockets like this one have been opened against ... [Interjections.]

Prof B TUROK: Chairperson, on a point of order: It seems to me that the
speaker is way beyond the bounds of what is allowed for the dignity of
Parliament and the Minister. [Interjections.] I ask you, Chairperson, to
make a ruling that the manner of speaking of this hon member goes beyond
what the Rules allow in terms of the dignity of this House.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, there are two
issues here.

The first one is that when it comes to the Votes, the widest degree of
latitude is allowed in covering the topic. Therefore, it is a parliamentary
tradition and it is a convention that one allows the widest degree of
latitude. That, I think, we will allow. That is the first part.

Concerning the second part, I think hon members will recall yesterday that
the Deputy Speaker made a point in which she said that she did not want
this as a point of order on which a ruling would be given, but encouraged
members to moderate their use of language in order that, through moderate
use of language, hon members were in a position to advance their arguments
and have them received properly on the other side.

All I can do is to repeat the wisdom that was expressed yesterday by the
Deputy Speaker in that it is really a matter of judgment of the person at
the podium, and it is not something, really, that the Chair can make a
ruling on. That is how I would like to guide this matter. [Interjections.]
Now I will take, if hon members will allow me now ... Is there a second
point of order, hon member?

Prof B TUROK: Chairperson, it was in that spirit that I raised the point of
order. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. [Interjections.] Yes, hon
member?
Adv A H GAUM: Chairperson, the Minister failed to answer ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order, Adv Gaum!
[Interjections.] Yes, hon member? [Interjections.] I cannot hear you.

Mr D M BAKKER: Chairperson, I wanted to address you on the same point of
order. I think you gave an excellent ruling, except to say that nothing
that we say on this side of the House can ever be as offensive as what some
of the Cabinet Ministers say during Question Time. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, that is not a point of
order and it is straying from the point. I think we have a perfect
understanding, and maybe if we go along with that understanding ...
[Interjections.] Yes, hon Deputy Minister Matthews?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairman, if there were going
to be personal attacks on the Minister, he should have been given notice
that this was going to be done. He should have known that he was going to
be subjected to personal attacks. [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Let us also accept here that
what the Deputy Minister says has validity to the extent that where you -
an hon member - wish to attack another hon member, you generally give that
hon member notice. It is a courtesy that that member be in the House at the
time when the criticism is being made. Now, the fact that in a debate such
as this one, which is the debate on a Minister's Vote, the Minister is in
the House and that notice can be dispensed with. Also, I think we must bear
in mind that the Minister will have the right to reply at the end of the
debate, at which point he will be able to answer some of these criticisms,
robust as they may be. So, that being the situation, I would now like the
hon member to continue with his speech.

Adv A H GAUM: Chairperson, the Minister still failed to answer what charges
appear in this dedicated space on the front cover of dockets, if dockets
exist. Who laid these charges and what statements, aside from that of James
Nkambule, appear on the inside of these documents? [Interjections.] The
police assure me that they will never start an investigation without a
charge and without opening a docket. [Interjections.]

It is ludicrous for the Minister to suggest that this information is
confidential, because he was willing to make the incredible revelation that
a charge of murder was being investigated against the President. The fact
is that with every single appearance in this House, he is becoming more
unfit to be the Minister of Safety and Security. [Interjections.] When he
is not appearing, he is conniving to undermine Parliament's oversight role
by withdrawing from a debate on the plot and by keeping Commissioner Jackie
Selebi from appearing before the Portfolio Committee on Safety and Security
to answer questions relating to the plot. [Interjections.]

We have also been told that in about November last year. SABC TV
interviewed both the Minister and Mr Nkambule regarding the alleged plot,
but these interviews were never broadcast. If it is indeed the case that he
was interviewed, the people would like to know from him whether the
President and the Commissioner of Police knew about these interviews. Also,
by whom and, more importantly, for what reason a decision was made not to
broadcast them? The people are tired of cowards, lies and Nkambule's spy
stories. They want answers. [Interjections.]

Moreover, they want to know whether this budget is going to be used to
fight crime or to sort out ANC cadres. The people have the right to know
whether the Minister is conducting a bona fide police investigation or, as
they widely suspect, whether the Minister is abusing and misusing his
position and the taxpayer's money.

A Minister of Safety and Security should not be policing the internal party
squabbles within the ANC; he should not be waving his fist at members of
Parliament. He should use the fist of the state against the murderers,
rapists and thieves that are bringing this country to its knees.
[Interjections.]

As this Minister is clearly unable to open his eyes to the bloody nightmare
of crime, shattering our dream of a free and prosperous South Africa, and
doing the job he is supposed to do, he should be fired. That is what Mr
Ramaphosa would have done if he was president. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr R P ZONDO: Chairperson, after having listened to allegations by hon
members of the DA about certain incidents, I am tempted to amend my speech
a little bit to accommodate an incident which I think hon Marthinus van
Schalkwyk and hon André Gaum omitted as part of their record list, and that
is the collapse of the statue of a former apartheid prime minister on 31
May.

It leaves me cold, completely cold, just like the speeches they make. This
reminds me of the words of Jimmy Kruger. Hon members will understand why.
Jimmy Kruger must have jumped in his grave as a result of the impact of the
collapse. Do hon members know why it collapsed? That is anathema. Some of
the hon members in this House are the unavoidable consequence and they are
going to get it.

Le batla serulumula ka mo morago. [Lesego.] [They need sustained pressure.
[Laughter.]]

On the other hand, people such as P W Botha, Tony de Klerk, that hon member
and Marthinus van Schalkwyk must have had a fright because of that
incident. Even today one can still see their green faces and read the
trauma on their faces. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, did you say Tony
de Klerk?

Mr R P ZONDO: No, I said Tony Leon.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: All right. I thought you said Tony de
Klerk. [Interjections.] [Laughter.]

Mr R P ZONDO: Be cool, be cool, be cool. [Interjections.] [Laughter.]
I would not be surprised if the DA made unfounded allegations about the
collapse, alleging that Minister Steve Tshwete went and stood in front of
it and ordered it to fall, saying: ``You go down, you go down.'' This will
not surprise our side. Maybe the hon members are still working on that
allegation. Although the collapse was due to structural failure, the DA
cannot come to terms with that fact. Instead they want an investigation to
be carried out. Sorry, DA, that was a structural fault.

follows.)

[We in the ANC are used to the utterances of hon members of the DA. We
accept them in the knowledge that they are made by delirious people. What
we do know, however, is that the pace of improving and bringing justice and
peace to all our people in South Africa as well as of the renewal of
Africa, as proposed by our head of state, the hon Mr Thabo Mbeki, is on
course. Their utterances remind us of what was said by ...]

... one of the senior members of the DA, who is a candidate for Minister of
Safety and Security, wishfully thinking of Tony Leon's cabinet. During the
preparation of the Firearms Control Bill he said in the portfolio committee
meeting: ``Whatever amendment the ANC could make, the DA shall never vote
for this Bill.'' The question followed: ``Why?'' The response was:
``Because the DA represents apartheid.'' That is how I understand the
``Deurmekaar'' Alliance. [Interjections.]

Die Deurmekaar Alliansie. [The confused alliance.]

On 12 October 2000 the DA voted against this Bill in this House, and this
statement was made by the hon Boy Geldenhuys, who has been replaced by the
hon Gaum, a political toddler who is learning fast about the strategies and
tactics of ``fight back'', as a representative of the aggrieved
constituency. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Hon member, are you
rising on a point of order?

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, on a point of order: The hon speaker is
deliberately misleading the House.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, you know that that
is not a point of order. [Interjections.] Order! Order! Hon members, if you
are aggrieved by what is being said, the remedy you have is that when you,
or a member of your party, comes to the podium, you can correct the matter.
[Interjections.] But it is not for the Chair ... [Interjections.] The Chair
has to preserve an impartial position - as we heard during the debate
earlier today.

There is no ruling that I can give on that. So, therefore, if you are
aggrieved by that, when your turn comes at the podium, then you can return
the compliment. [Interjections.]

Hon Geldenhuys, would you please come to the microphone again?
[Interjections.] It is unparliamentary to say that anyone is
``misleading'', when he is not deliberately misleading. In respect of that
point that you raised, I would ask you to withdraw, please.
[Interjections.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Mr Chairman, I am not going to withdraw that statement,
because he is misleading the House.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, please remain at
the microphone. Let me take a little moment to explain to you againÿ.ÿ.ÿ.
[Interjections.] Order! No member of this House may say that any other hon
member is deliberately misleading the House. The consequences of that make
it impossible to have a Parliament as we understand it, and being an hon
member of this House, it is in your interests, as much as in the interests
of Parliament as a whole, that we keep the integrity of the House intact.
Therefore, I appeal again to you as a member of long standing, to recognise
that, and to support the Chair in withdrawing.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, what other remedy do I then have?
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, as I indicated,
the remedy that you have is that you can approach the Speaker or the
Presiding Officer to make a statement at some point. You could participate
in the debate, or when your turn comes and you are at the podium, you can
do that.

Hon members here have requested the right to hold a robust debate. I think
in the spirit of that it would be fair that we allow the robust debate
without charging the House, or individuals, at the base level that they are
deliberately misleading the House.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, I will withdraw ... [Interjections.] ...
but I will make use of your first option, and I will approach the Speaker
for an opportunity to make a statement. [Interjections.] However, I
withdraw it.

Mr R P ZONDO: Motlatsamodulasetulo, e re ke se tsentshe gagolo serumula se.
[Chairperson, let me pressurise them even further.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, I am sorry, there
is another member who is rising on a point of order.

Mr M RAMGOBIN: Mr Chairperson, I would like to have your ruling on this.
When a member of this Parliament defies an instruction from the Chair, I
believe, in terms of the parliamentary Rules, that member should be ordered
out of the House, and not be subjected to a lecture from the Chair in the
form of an appeal. I think the integrity of all other members present in
this House is compromised. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, there are remedies
that are available to the Chair. But the Chair also has to exercise a
certain amount of discretion. In a debate such as this, where the emotions
are running fairly high, it is in order for the Chair to guide and to
direct. May I direct the attention of the hon members, this afternoon, to a
resolution or a motion that was before the House. One of the points that
was made was that the presiding officers would have to guide and to direct
and that, therefore, before one reaches for punitive measures, the
presiding officer should be allowed to use his or her discretion. I would
like to suggest that we leave it at that, and the presiding officer would
be the judge when a more serious approach should be used.

Mna R P ZONDO: Ka lebaka la gore ke bona gore serumula se se ba swere, se a
ba šoma, le gona ga ba kgone go se swarelela, ke tla tsena mo tabeng. Ba
tla no e nyanya e kitima. (Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[Mr R P ZONDO: Since I realise that the pressure I have exerted is working
on them, I will now focus on the subject under discussion. Ways and means
will have to be devised to ensure that success is achieved.]

Ek moet net 'n perd ry sonder saal, Salie! [Gelag.] Ja. [I must simply ride
a horse without a saddle, Salie! [Laughter.] Yes.]

The President, in his state of the nation address in February this year,
once again stated that safety and security of all citizens is a fundamental
right, and that the Government will continue to pay the necessary attention
to this issue of crime.

Crime results in deprivation of rights and dignity of citizens. It poses a
threat to loving people of our country, strikes fear into the hearts of
South Africans from all walks of life and prevents them from taking their
rightful place in the development and growth of our country.

For this reason, the Government regards the prevention of crime as a
national priority. Cabinet initiated the National Crime Prevention Strategy
in March 1995. In particular, the NCPS is based on the development of wider
responsibility for crime prevention and a shift in emphasis from reactive
crime control, which deploys most resources towards responding after crime
has already been committed, towards proactive crime control.

My understanding of this strategy is to focus on those stations and areas
where most of the crimes are being committed to empower the police stations
in those areas, and to focus resources where they are really needed. At the
same time, infrastructure is necessary at the station level to ensure that
crime intelligence is fed from the grassroots level into the information
system of the SA Police Services. We know that technology comes at a price,
but holds tremendous benefits in terms of increased productivity and
effectiveness.

Ke a tseba gore ditiragalo le maitapišo a go swana le a a š etše a direga.
[I know that events and efforts like these are now taking place.]

In terms of training, much has been done regarding an establishment of
crime intelligence officers at the station level. The challenge that we are
faced with as Government is to take hands with our sons and daughters in
the police services to fight this monster of crime, to ensure safe
communities where one can move around without fear of rape, hijacking,
house-breaking and so on. This can be achieved by actively participating in
community police forums, as well as programmes such as rural safety plans
and supporting reservists.

Ka boikokobetšo, ke dira kgopelo go batho gore ba tlogele go thekga
mekgatlo e tletšego boganka le lesenyo go swana le Mapogo a Mathamaga le
kangaroo courts. Yoo a šikinyegago yena o a kwa gore ke bolela ka eng, ka
gore o kgona go tloga Randfontein a kitimela Mamelodi go nyenefatša ka
maikemišetšo a go uša setšhaba seo. Ke selo sa kgale seo, ebile e fetile. O
a tseba. (Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[My humble appeal to the public out there is that people should refrain
from supporting vigilante groups such as Mapogo Mathamaga and kangaroo
courts that are involved in terror tactics, violence and destruction.
Anyone who is aware of these groups will know what I am talking about,
because he or she can move from Randfontein to Mamelodi with the intention
of bringing those communities down. He knows full well that it is an old
thing and has passed with time.]

We should stick to and follow the guidelines of the National Crime
Prevention Strategy.

In conclusion, the ANC is encouraged by other role-players that are
involved in specific projects, plans or initiatives impacting on crime
within the geographical spread of various provinces, in particular
metropolitan and rural projects. Role-players such as Business against
Crime focus on projects related to the improvement of the criminal justice
system, service delivery, improvement in the SA Police Service and ICD.
Banking councils are involved in projects related to violent crimes against
the banking industry, including cash-in-transit robberies, robberies and
thefts at ATMs, white-collar crimes and so on.

My area of concern is co-ordination, which needs to be strengthened to
avoid duplication of resources. The ANC supports the SAPS budget.
[Applause.]

Ms A VAN WYK: Chairperson, the past year saw the focus in safety and
security shifting towards a moratorium on crime statistics as imposed. We
welcome the lifting of the moratorium and express the hope that South
Africa will never again have to experience a blackout of information by a
Government which is supposed to be transparent. It is reminiscent of the
apartheid era's state of emergency and control of the media. It does not
become a democratic Government.

An essential statistic that still remains is the question of what the ideal
staff component of the SAPS should be. This needs to be answered
unequivocally and then everything possible should be done to achieve that
figure. It is estimated that crime costs R30 billion per year. This is
money that we do not have in the light of other glaring priorities.

Last year during the budget debate, the UDM asked for a differentiation
between the salaries of SAPS members and those of the rest of the Public
Service in what we believed was a long and hard battle with the national
Treasury. The Minister of Safety and Security did succeed in achieving
that. We congratulate him on this.

What remains to be implemented is a new promotional scheme for members of
the SAPS. Human resources management should be able to devise and implement
a career development scheme that would allow members of the SAPS to be
promoted without their hitting a ceiling and then their crime combating
knowledge being lost to the private industry.

This budget reflects substantial increases where it matters the most. It
will never be enough and there will always be arguments for more. We
believe that it is a fair and just budget in a country with pressing
priorities. It should impact positively on crime-fighting and crime-
prevention programmes.

This budget requires from the men and women in blue, whether at command
level or station level or in visible policing, commitment, will and
responsibility. It requires the commitment to make do with the resources at
their disposal, the will to make the difference, and the responsibility to
return the trust and investment placed in them, so that where new vehicles
are provided to stations, these are used to fight crime and not to drive
home or do private business with. It demands of station commanders and
their staff to be proud, to want to succeed, and to demonstrate that
through making a difference through the actual affect of their work on
crime prevention. There is a thin blue line between anarchy and us. We are
proud of the men and women in blue and support them.

The UDM calls for an assessment tool that can measure the effect that the
increase in the three major programmes on actual policing have on the
policeable crimes. The UDM believes that such a measuring tool will enable
the police management to determine the shortcomings within the human
resources structures of the SAPS.

An alarming factor for the UDM is the interface between the Department of
Safety and Security and the Department of Home Affairs. Following reports
from both the Minister of Home Affairs and the DG that systems of the
department will collapse this financial year, the UDM is concerned about
the effects of this on the department, and whether this budget makes
provision for such an event.

The movement control system is used by the SAPS in controlling wanted
criminals and ensuring that they do not cross our borders, and this comes
to mind. Failure of this system will negatively influence our international
agreements and co-operation with Interpol. The firearms legislation also
requires close co-operation between the Department of Home Affairs and the
SAPS. It is not clear from this budget that funds are available for
emergency measures that might be necessary to implement.

I would also like to concentrate on the issue of policing priorities, and,
more specifically, that of gangsterism, and we welcome the announcement
made by the Minister this afternoon. This phenomenon is affecting a
significant sector of our society. It occurs where dysfunctional families
exist, where there is a high school dropout level, where unemployment,
especially amongst the youth, is high, and where there is easy access to
alcohol and drugs. It is evident that in the absence of a clear identity
and functional communities, gangs become the primary means of building
identity and creating a sense of belonging.

It is obvious from the activities that gangs involve themselves in that
their criminal activities are policeable activities. These include mugging,
housebreaking, robbery, murder, assault, rape and dealing in drugs.

To deal with gangs effectively, a multidisciplinary approach is needed. In
gang-infested areas, the focus should be on poverty alleviation, job
creation for the youth and recreational activities geared towards the
improvement of communal living.

Currently, the police are only able to deal with the issue reactively,
after the members of a gang have committed a crime. To deal with the issue
proactively, a range of other stakeholders need to be brought on board.

These, first and foremost, include the community and community leaders
where the gangs house themselves. Local government, the Departments of
Social Development, Public Works, Education, Health and Sport and
Recreation are but a few that should be drawn into the process.

In the Western Cape, it was reported that more than 130 people died since 3
January 2001 in gang-related incidents. In 1998, only 50 people reportedly
died in gang-related violence throughout the country. In the first five
months of this year, this figure has doubled in the Western Cape alone. If
we consider this figure in terms of the size of the communities where
incidents occur, then the seriousness of this matter is amplified even
further.

It is estimated that between 80 000 and 100 000 people in the Western Cape
belong to gangs, and that 70% of all crimes committed in the Western Cape
is gang-related. Juveniles between the ages of 11 and 15 are increasingly
committing gang-related crimes and are used as assassins against rival
gangs, because they will be treated as juvenile offenders.

Successes in dealing with urban terror should be acknowledged and, by the
look of it, the problem in the Western Cape has been brought under control.
However, this is in the cases of high-profile city attacks. In answer to a
question put to the Minister, the following information was revealed
regarding the number of acts of urban terror and bombings that took place
since 1998 up to the date of the moratorium.

In 1998, there were 154 attacks, 73 injuries, 49 deaths, 21 arrests, five
convictions and only four sentences handed down. In 1999, there were 58
attacks, 127 injuries, 20 deaths, 29 arrests, four convictions and three
sentences handed down. We are aware of approximately eight of these
attacks. These would include the Planet Hollywood bomb, St Elmo's, Cape
Town International Airport and a few others. The rest we do not know of.

These urban terrors in Cape Town city centre, Newlands, Sea Point and Camps
Bay might have been brought under control, but the continuous attacks in
other areas of Cape Town are spiralling out of control. A sector of our
society is under siege and the majority of the attacks not reported are
taking place in Grassy Park, Athlone, Mitchells Plain, Salt River and
Manenberg.

If we support the principle of not having second-class citizens in South
Africa, then we need to receive an answer to why these communities are not
enjoying or receiving the same attention as those in the more affluent
areas of Cape Town.

We will support the budget. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Mr Chairperson and hon members,
I am bewildered by the fact that the Minister did not complete his speech,
and I was informed that there was a limit of 20 minutes, or something like
that, for the delivery of speeches on the budget. This is quite
unfortunate, in my view. I do not know when this rule was introduced, but I
do say that it does rob the House of important information, even if the
Minister may subsequently complete his speech when he replies.

I must say that I am getting concerned about the level and quality of our
debates in this House. It is quite a worry, because as the level drops, we
become incoherent and it becomes difficult for anyone to follow the
arguments.

I want to quote the great economist Lord Keynes, who said: ``Wanton
incoherent assertion has been the privilege of the harlot throughout the
ages.'' However, I really feel that especially personal references and
attacks are detracting from our democracy.

I recall that during the fight against apartheid our leaders never made
personal attacks against those who were in power at the time. [Applause.] I
simply do not recall, over a period of 50 years, attacks on Dr Malan, Dr
Verwoerd, Mr Vorster or Mr Strijdom.

I do not recall that there were attempts at personal denigration of those
leaders. I just do not recall it. Despite the fact that we may have
criticised, very viciously, their actions and policies, I do not recall us
descending to the level of personal denigration of leaders such as we have
seen, for example, in relation to even such an important person as the
President of the country.

I am wondering why this is the case. Then of course, one recalls that we
were subjected to a lot of attacks, and over a period of - let us take the
period of the oldest political organisation - 90 years. There was a
consistent policy of attacks of an unfortunate nature which, fortunately,
we did not imitate. We thought we should not do that, and we never did.

Therefore, I want to say that in the House as well, we should endeavour to
present our arguments - I thought the previous debate was fairly well-
argued, the debate on the Speaker, but what has been happening now in the
Safety and Security Vote, I think is very unfortunate.

Of course, people always forget that when one gets rid of one person, one
can get someone who is worse. [Laughter.] I was in Singapore when the news
of the overthrow of Mr Milton Obote was reported, during the Commonwealth
conference, in 1971. Hon members should see where I have been travelling.
When that announcement was made, there was a lot of celebration among the
people sitting in front of me, the Prime Minister of Great Britain and his
delegation, and, of course, we got Idi Amin, [Laughter.] The massacres
occurred thereafter, and so it did not benefit anybody to gloat at the fall
of Obote.

I believe, quite sincerely, that if one looks at the issue of crime as
such, this Minister is doing very well [Applause.] Of course, there are
lots of things that one can complain about, but then one must look at the
substance of the issue: the issue of crime, the morale of the police and so
on. I believe that he has made a great deal of progress and it will be a
pity if what I call the ``encrustations'' of the thief diverted us from the
merits of the Minister in organising the fight against crime.

People think, and I have heard it said, that the criminals would rejoice
the day they hear that Tshwete is no longer Minister of Safety and
Security. All over the shebeens they will drink champagne. When we look at
the fact that we have accommodation for 99 000 prisoners in our country and
we have 170 000 prisoners behind bars right now, can we still say that
nothing is happening?

Where are all those people who weekly robbed banks? Where are all the
people who have been terrorising everybody, especially in the townships?
Operation Crackdown has dealt a blow to many of those and they have left
those areas. It is true they are now operating elsewhere. They are looking
for soft targets in the farming areas and with burglaries. They have run
away from the big, glamorous cash heists which everybody used to talk
about. They were being killed left and right when they attempted those
robberies against the financial institutions.

I do not think that the situation is one in which we should only see the
negatives, though the negatives are bad enough. Of course, one can find
plenty to say about crime in our country, because the situation is bad
enough. I only worry that if we had not dealt with it in a particular way,
it would have been worse.

I have been following the general elections in Britain and one of the
biggest issues was crime. This may come as a surprise to some that there is
a crime wave there, especially in the metropolitan area in London. They
were supposed to have Scotland Yard and the best police in the world. There
we are. Those who have been talking tough and saying the British government
or the Labour Party is soft on crime, will see what the results are at the
end, starting from ten o'clock tonight, to see whether the people believed
what they said. It will be interesting to see what the British people think
about the concentrated attacks on the government and its handling of the
crime issue.

Of course, we had a similar experience, despite my warnings during the last
election that nobody could benefit from the crime issue in this country.
What happened was that the Government party increased its majority.
[Applause.] The lesson of that is really that it is an issue involving
everybody, including former commissioners of police. They are not exempted
from being victims of crime. We are all equal now and therefore we need an
equal effort from everybody to try to fight this evil. I hope that the
Minister will be able to complete his speech, because it contains some
important features. I ask the House to support the Vote.

Ms M M SOTYU: Chairperson, members of Parliament, members of the SAPS ...

... Mhlalingaphambili, andisokuze ndime apha ke mna ndixelele uMphathiswa
woKhuselo noKhuseleko into yokuba kufuneka umsebenzi wakhe awenze njani na.
Ndiza kuma apha ndize kuthetha ngolwaphulo-mthetho olongamele uMzantsi
Afrika. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[... Chairperson, I will not stand here and tell the Minister of Safety and
Security how he should do his work. I will stand up here and talk about
crime that has engulfed South Africa.]

Violence against women and children is a gross violation of human rights.
The ANC welcomes the increased budget for members of Parliament - in fact
for SAPS members - for 2001-02. [Laughter.]

Ndiyingxamele makhosikazi, niyayibona na loo nto? Ndilambile. [I am in
hurry, fellow South African women; can you see that? I am hungry for it.]

The ANC-led Government has committed itself to the eradication of any form
of violence against women and children. The numbers of incidents of
domestic violence in which women, children and the elderly are victims
appear to be continually on the increase in South Africa. This kind of
crime is listed as one of the policing priorities of the SAPS.

The department has initiated an expensive police training programme to
facilitate the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act which came into
effect in December 1999. The Act also requires police to offer a service to
victims of domestic violence, including protection and transport to places
of safety.

The ANC-led Government would like to see rural police stations transformed
into people-service institutions. Victims of domestic violence are not yet
served in the way that we expected. We want to see the conditions of our
police stations in rural areas improved to cater for victims of domestic
violence and battered women.

Siyabulela kuMphathiswa ngenkqubela-phambili kwezinye zezitishi zamapolisa.
Kaloku, ngaye lo chatha simphiweyo apha kweli Sebe loKhuselo noKhuseleko
sithanda ukubona iimeko zezitishi zasemaphandleni ziphuculwa ukuze zibe
kumgangatho oncumisayo, kwandiswe neenqwelo zamapolisa ukuncedisana
nokuthuthwa kwamaxhoba esiya kwiindawo zokhuseleko. (Translation of Xhosa
paragraph follows.)
[We would like to thank the Minister for the progress we see at some police
stations. We in the Department of Safety and Security would like to see
conditions of police stations in our rural areas developed, and the number
of vehicles increased so as to cope with the numbers of victims that would
need to be taken to places of safety.]

Crime knows no colour. In order for us to eliminate this sickness, we need
to unite in action against this crime.

Siyazibona iinzame ezenziwa liSebe lakhe zokufikelela nakwezona ndawo
zazilityelwe mandulo phaya. Ndiza kuzama ukukhankanya ezinye zezitishi
esakhe safika kuzo ezifana neziya zaphaya eFree State, eBotshabelo,
eKagisanong naseBatho.

Siyavuma ukuba uyazama kodwa, ngathi ubucothara uMhlekazi. Masibhinqeleni
phezulu ukwenzela ukuba amarhamncwa la angayi kugaya iivoti kuthi phaya
ezantsi kubahlali. Kaloku le nkqubela-phambili siyenzayo abayiboni,
bayibona ngeliso elineenyembezi. (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[We can see his department's efforts, trying to reach out to those places
that were forgotten in the past. I will mention a few like those in the
Free State, Botshabelo, Kagisanong and Batho.

We do acknowledge these efforts but the process seems slow. Let us pull our
socks up and try to expedite the process so that the enemies would not get
a chance to campaign. People at grass-roots level complain that they cannot
clearly see the development we bring about, because by the time it takes
place they have lost faith in us.]

Police need to be trained to deal with this kind of crime in order to
ensure that they are able to make informed decisions that best protect
victims of abuse.

Furthermore, the department's intersectoral approach adopted to combat
crime against women and children foresees the implementation of crisis and
trauma centres and awareness programmes, and the strengthening of units to
deal with family violence, childcare and sexual abuse.

We welcome the special programmes which are already in place for the
training of female members to deal with domestic violence for example, the
one in Thohoyandou in the Northern Province.

Mhlalingaphambili, ndithanda ukukhe ndigxininise komnye umkhwa okhoyo,
wokuthi xa siwusebenzisa uMthetho wobuNdlobongela baseKhaya siwusebenzise
ngendlela engeyiyo. Umthetho omalunga nobundlobongela basekhaya awuthi
makukhuselwe kuphela amalungelo abafazi nabantwana. Kuthiwa amalungelo
omntu wonke kufuneka ekhuselwe ngulo mthetho, namalungelo abantu
abangootata kuba ... (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, I would like to speak about the habit of applying the Act
about domestic violence in the wrong circumstances. The Act does not say
that only women's and children's rights should be protected. It says that
everybody's rights should be protected, men's included ...]

... we do get abusive women among ourselves ...

... kuba sithanda ukuthi xa siwutolika lo mthetho wobundlobongela basekhaya
siwutolike bugwenxa. [... we have a habit of interpreting this Act
wrongly.]

The Bill of Rights contained in Chapter 2 of the Constitution of South
Africa of 1996 entrenches the right of every person to equality, freedom
and security.

Masiyeke ukusebenzisa abantwana bethu njengoonozakuzaku bokuhambisa
iziyobisi. Abazali mabayeke ukurhweba ngabantwana, ngakumbi abantwana
abangamantombazana. Umzali akubona umntwana oyintombazana efika endlwini
ephethe imali, makambuze ukuba uyithabatha phi na le mali, angasuki nje
azithulele. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Let us stop using our children in our drug-selling activities. Parents
must stop trading with their daughters. When parents see that their
daughters come home with lots of money, they should ask them about it, and
not just keep quiet.]

Members of the SAPS are faced with an extremely difficult task in that they
are exposed to a high incidence of these kinds of crime. These include rape
and sexual harassment. Fathers rape their wives and children and it is also
reported that in some schools teachers rape learners. This promotes a high
level of HIV and Aids infections. Special efforts are needed to ensure
improved collaboration between all role-players involved in combating
domestic violence.

Let us commend the police for their effort in fighting this evil monster
under difficult circumstances. The Family and Child Protection Unit
confiscated and seized a huge amount of child pornography. A number of
cases have led to 61 life sentences between 1999 and 2000.

It is widely welcomed that the SAPS has put in place a new domestic
violence coding system that will for the first time provide accurate
statistics on recorded cases. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Chairperson, on Wednesday 22 May 1996, the National Crime
Prevention Strategy document was launched by the then Deputy President and
now our President, Mr Thabo Mbeki. The interdepartmental strategy team that
compiled that document highlighted what they called the roots of the
current crime situation. The first root that they identified was the
breaking down of the family and traditional communities.

The budget before us today does not address this root of our current crime
situation. There are currently some police officers who are being
investigated for crimes they have committed, including raping young girls.
There are also women who have laid charges against the police for raping
them in police stations when they go there for help. If women and young
girls cannot turn to the police for help when they are molested and abused,
where must they turn?
It seems crimes committed by some members of the police are becoming more
serious in nature. A very strong message must be sent out that corruption
and all forms of criminal activity will not be tolerated, especially in the
department that is responsible for maintaining law and order in the
country.

The hon the Minister must ensure that the public do not lose their
confidence in the police because of their carelessness and irresponsible
actions. Members of the community are always asked to come forward, report
crime and work with the police. This will not be possible without our
communities trusting the police.

The police must be seen to be working for the community and not against the
community. That is why the ACDP appeals to the hon the Minister to ensure
that all members of the SA Police Services clean up their act and start
serving their communities with diligence, discipline and empathy.

The second root of the current crime situation identified in the NCPS
document is what they call insufficient and ill-equipped police personnel.
The recruitment of more police only will not solve our crime problem in
this country. What is the use of having more police who are afraid of
criminals who seem to be better armed than they are? We used to have many
satellite police stations in our townships to make them more accessible to
members of the public. Many of these satellite stations, such as those on
the East Rand, have been shut down because we were told that it was
dangerous for police officers to remain there. They were being attacked by
criminals.

I want to suggest that the killing of police officers should not only be
highlighted by the news media, as was suggested by the hon Mluleki George,
but it must be a very serious criminal offence punishable by death. If
police personnel are withdrawn from so-called dangerous areas, then who
will protect the innocent law-abiding citizens? It is in fact despicable
that our police, who are supposed to protect people against crime, are the
ones committing the crimes or withdrawing their presence from known
dangerous areas.

Will the hon the Minister please tell us if there are plans to open new
satellite police stations, especially in areas like the Cape Flats where
gangsterism is disrupting normal schooling and causing innocent people to
live in fear? Gangsterism must be obliterated. The law to make membership
of a gang illegal is long overdue. I will welcome the Minister's indication
that such a law is going to be passed, because the suffering caused by
gangsterism, especially in this province, is too much.

What the ACDP has been calling for is not only better paid and better
qualified police personnel, but a tougher stance against criminals. For as
long as criminals do not fear punishment, Government will not win its fight
against crime. Criminals must fear the arm of the law. They must be taught
that crime does not pay.

In conclusion, we applaud all efforts used to rid our Police Service of
fraudulent and criminal cops. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon members, in that area
there and around here, you are conversing so loudly that I can hear your
conversation over here. May I please appeal to you to lower your voices in
order that the person at the podium may be heard.

Mr G P MNGOMEZULU: Chairperson, allow me to share with this august House a
poem entitled ``Another Woman'' by Carol Geneya Kaplan:


  Today another woman died and not on a foreign field ...
  She died without CNN covering her war. She died without talk of
  intelligent bombs and strategic targets. The target was simply her face,
  her back and her pregnant belly. The target was this life that had been
  loved and not loved ... A life like yours or mine that had stumbled up
  from a beginning and had learned to walk and had learned to read, and had
  learned to sing. Another woman died today, not far from where you live;
  Just there, next door where the tall light falls across the pavement.
  Just there, a few steps away where you've often heard shouting, Another
  woman died today ...


  And someone has confused his rage with this woman's only life.

What this poem illustrates to us is that domestic violence involves a
batterer and a victim. It further indicates that domestic violence is
aggression with the purpose of controlling, intimidating and subjugating
one's partner. It shows that domestic violence, wherever it is practised,
is done with the intention to establish and maintain power and control over
one's spouse.

Arguments, anger, conflicts and misunderstandings have featured in all
relationships at one time or another, but they do not automatically suggest
that the relationship is an abusive one. A relationship only becomes
abusive when the behaviour assumes a violent form. For instance, drugs and
alcohol can aggravate violent behaviour, but is in no way the cause of
domestic violence. This is because many violent men, and some women, abuse
their partners and children regardless of whether they are intoxicated or
not.

Femicide, which is murder specifically targeted at women, is in the main
carried out by men. There is also what we call intimate femicide, in which
one finds that a man who has killed or murdered his partner will also kill
his children and/or members of his partner's family and even the man
suspected of having an affair with his partner.

As the ANC Government, we have gone a long way in addressing this
unacceptable behaviour by most men and women in our society. As a signatory
to the UN Convention on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which
states, inter alia, that all signatories to this convention should provide
effective legal measures to protect women against violence, our Government
implemented the following. Firstly, we launched the National Action Plan
for the Protection of Human Rights in 1998; secondly, we passed the
Domestic Violence Act; and thirdly, we also passed the Maintenance Act and
the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act. All these Acts are beginning to
make a significant impact on our communities.

We want to call upon all hon members, our fathers, brothers, uncles and
grandfathers to take a strong stance in exposing those men who are abusing
their families and condemning them in the strongest possible terms. We also
wish to appeal to Government to include gender violence prevention
programmes in our school curriculum.

Lastly, let me also take this opportunity to express our gratitude to our
police officers, who are often the first point of contact with women who
are being abused, for the sterling work that they are doing. To them we are
saying, keep it up, and we are there to assist them through our community
police forums. [Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, die agb Minister kom vanmiddag sê,
onder meer, dat daar strenger beheer van onwettige wapens moet plaasvind.
Die VF stem saam met die agb Minister dat daar strenger beheer oor
onwettige wapens moet wees. Maar die VF vra ook aan die agb Minister: Is
daar beheer oor vuurwapens in die SAPD?
As ons gaan kyk, dan sien ons dat daar in 1999, 1 427 vuurwapens verlore
geraak het of gesteel is in die departement. Verlede jaar is 1 697
vuurwapens verlore of gesteel. Dit is 270 meer vuurwapens as die vorige
jaar, 1999. Ek wil vir die agb Minister sê, dit is 1 697 onwettige
vuurwapens wat nou in omloop is, want hulle het verlore geraak of is
gesteel. Die agb Minister en die departement moet die voorbeeld stel, want
dit is 'n bedrag van R3,9 miljoen ten koste van die belastingbetaler.

'n Ander aspek waaroor ek wil praat, is onregmatige arrestasies. Meer en
meer moet 'n mens in die media lees van lede van die publiek wat onregmatig
gearresteer word. Onlangs moes 'n mens lees dat selfs 'n swanger vrou
gearresteer is omdat sy kwansuis nie haar verkeersboete betaal het nie - en
dit terwyl sy wel die boete betaal het en selfs 'n kwitansie aan die lede
van die polisie getoon het. Die polisielede het hulle eenvoudig net nie
daaraan gesteur nie. Hulle het haar geïntimideer en so getraumatiseer dat
sy 'n dreigende miskraam het. Dit is die gevolg van 'n onregmatige
arrestasie.

'n Mens moet gereeld lees van blanke boere wat op vals klagtes op Vrydae
gearresteer word en die naweek in die polisieselle moet deurbring. Gereeld
moet 'n mens lees van polisiebeamptes wat gemagtig is om borg vir hierdie
lede te gee, maar net eenvoudig weier, sodat die landdros Maandag moet vra
hoekom die betrokke polisie-offisier wat daar was, nie borg gegee het nie.
Daar kan met reg gevra word: is die SAPD daar om die lede van die publiek
te beskerm of om hulle te intimideer? Hierdie onregmatige arrestasies word
weerspieël as gekyk word na die toename in regskostes van die departement.
In 1999 was die regskoste, wat siviele eise insluit, R27,8 miljoen. Verlede
jaar, in 2000, het die regskoste tot R53,8 miljoen gestyg, 'n toename van
R26 miljoen, wat siviele eise insluit.

Die ergste is die groot aantal onregmatige inhegtenisnemings deur talle
lede van die polisie. Die publiek tree tereg na vore en vra vrae. Om 'n
swanger vrou in hegtenis te neem vir 'n sogenaamde verkeersboete word twee
tot drie voertuie met vier tot vyf lede van die polisie gebruik. By ander
geleenthede, in die geval van 'n navraag en wanneer die polisie gevra word
om uit te kom, sê hulle eenvoudig daar is nie genoeg mannekrag en voertuie
beskikbaar nie.

Die vraag is: Watter voorbeeld stel die agb Minister van Veiligheid en
Sekuriteit? As Minister is hy die hoogste gesag wat die belastingbetaler se
geld verteenwoordig. Dié agb Minister reageer op ongetoetste getuienis. Hy
beskuldig lede van die publiek in die openbaar asof hulle deel van 'n
komplot is. As dié agb Minister in die Parlement aangespreek word, word
daar vir die opposisie gesê hulle moet nie persoonlik raak nie, want dit
pas nie by politici nie.

As die agb Minister egter persoonlik raak en persoonlike aanvalle doen op
lede van die publiek, maak dit nie saak nie. 'n Bewys daarvan is dat die
agb President die Minister gerepudieer het. Hy het vir hom gesê dat hy nie
die name van lede van die publiek moes genoem het nie.

Die agb Minister stel 'n swak voorbeeld vir die departement deur stellings
te maak op ongetoetse getuienis én daarop te reageer. Dit is daarom geen
wonder daar is soveel onregmatige inhegtenisnemings nie. Die VF sê daarom
die agb Minister behoort die eerbare weg te volg en te bedank. (Translation
of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairman, the hon the Minister said here this
afternoon, inter alia, that there should be stricter control of illegal
firearms. The FF agrees with the hon the Minister that there should be
stricter control of illegal firearms. But the FF also wants to ask the hon
the Minister: Is there control over firearms in the SAPS?

When we look at this, we see that in 1999, 1 427 firearms were lost or
stolen in the department. Last year 1 697 firearms were lost or stolen.
This is 270 more firearms than the previous year, 1999. I want to tell the
hon the Minister that that makes it 1 697 illegal firearms that are now in
circulation because they were lost or stolen. The hon the Minister and the
department should set an example, because this represents an amount of R3,9
million at the expense of the taxpayer.

Another aspect that I want to talk about is unlawful arrests. One reads
more and more in the media about members of the public who are arrested
unlawfully. Recently one even read that a pregnant woman was arrested
because she had ostensibly failed to pay a traffic fine - and that while
she had paid the fine and even showed the members of the police a receipt
to that effect. The members of the police simply ignored it. They
intimidated her and traumatised her to such a degree that she almost
suffered a miscarriage. This is the result of an unlawful arrest.

One reads regularly about white farmers who are arrested on false charges
on a Friday and then have to spend the weekend in jail. One reads regularly
about police officers who are authorised to grant these members of the
public bail, but simply refuse to do so, so that the magistrate has to ask
on Monday why the relevant police officer had not granted bail. One may
quite rightly ask: Is the SAPS there to protect members of the public or to
intimidate them?

These unlawful arrests are reflected in the increase in the legal costs of
the department. In 1999 the legal costs, which includes civil claims,
amounted to R27,8 million. Last year, in 2000, the legal costs increased to
R53,8 million, an increase of R26 million, which includes civil claims.

The worst is the large number of unlawful arrests by many members of the
police. The public, justifiably, is stepping forward and asking questions.
To arrest a pregnant woman for a so-called traffic fine, two to three
vehicles, with four to five members of the police, are used. On other
occasions, in the case of an enquiry, when the police are asked to come
out, they simply say that insufficient manpower and vehicles are available.

The question is: What example does the hon the Minister of Safety and
Security set? As Minister he is the highest authority representing the
taxpayer's money. This hon Minister reacts to unproven evidence. He accuses
members of the public in public, of being part of a conspiracy. When this
hon Minister is reprimanded in Parliament the opposition is told not to
become personal, because it is not appropriate for politicians to do so.

When the hon the Minister becomes personal, however, and makes personal
attacks on members of the public, it does not matter. Proof of this is that
the hon President repudiated the Minister. He told him that he should not
have mentioned the names of members of the public.

The hon the Minister is setting a poor example to the department when he
makes statements on the basis of unproven evidence and reacts to it. It is
therefore no wonder that there are so many unlawful arrests. That is why
the FF says that the hon the Minister should take the honourable course of
action and resign.]

(Translation of Setswana paragraphs follows.)

[Mr Q J KGAUWE: Chairperson, it is so sad when white people are arrested,
and released over weekends without going to court. When this happens to
black people nothing is said about it. It is really surprising that we
always have to protect white people only. I do not know when we will
liberate our country from such things.

In the past, only black people were arrested. Now that black people can
arrest whites, they have the right to appeal.]

Resources will be made available to the police because of their ability to
execute their work properly. During a budget presentation to the committee,
their union representatives were quite happy about the improvement of their
salaries. A total of 78% of their budget is spent on personnel.

It is regrettable that, for the past six years, the SAPS had no
transformation policy. The report of the Auditor-General can confirm that.
Now there seems to be some movement. It was agreed that all functionally
trained policemen should be redeployed, for administrative reasons, to
perform police duties.

A total of 28 148 functional members are awaiting redeployment. The
department intends to do it in phases of 5 000 per annum over a period of
five years. Admittedly, this process is very slow. At head office more than
1 000 staff members were not replaced.

Near Potchefstroom a white farmer obtained a court order to evict his black
tenants. This falls under the provincial head office of Commissioner
Lesetja Beetha. Police rushed to evict the tenants from the farm and left
them at the roadside. Another court interdict against the eviction was
sought and obtained, instructing the farmer to allow the tenants safe
return to their original place of residence. The police refused to
implement the High Court order and the evicted families reside alongside
the road to this day.

In Klerksdorp the station commissioner is an Indian African. It has taken
almost two years to get a replacement. All other units are still being run
by white persons. Sometimes it is difficult for them to adapt to
transformation, including the crime intelligence and gathering unit.
The department has embarked on a process of teaching police officers how to
drive. This exercise is funded by the department and members are encouraged
to undergo such training. In the end we will be able to do away with the
notion that there are no bakkies, or transport, to attend to a crime scene.

With regard to illiteracy within the SAPS, it is regretful, but the
situation is being addressed. When one echoes promotion and transformation,
somebody will respond by saying: yes, but your members are not educated.
This is an obstacle. All those members who are disadvantaged were all
recruited by the DA and apartheid regime. They were misused before, and
some were forced to commit atrocities. The beneficiaries were the white
men, the DP and the New NP.

The ANC Government has assured and embraced them with full confidence, and
has taken them on board. We will enable them to succeed, because they are
our brothers and sisters and we value their contributions.

Concerning the farm killings, that is highly regrettable, and we will
condemn every killing. We must investigate and establish the motive behind
these killings, so that we can be at peace with our neighbours. Then we
will be able to ask whether what was said was the truth. We must create a
conducive climate between a farm owner and the farmworkers.

Innocent people are being killed with unlicensed firearms. The ANC
Government has transformed that firearm unit. We are able to report that 10
000 firearms were registered in the names of deceased persons. Further
investigations revealed that 44 000 firearms were still in the hands of
aged people, and that 24 000 owners were deceased. Different departments
are unable to account for 68 000 firearms. This is a great stride forward
that one can be proud of and one can expect more miracles.

With regard to the culture of the human rights, it is clear that it has to
be entrenched into mind-sets. So, 19 000 police officers were trained in
human rights practices. We appreciate the exercise embarked upon by our
members. This will enable them to be reckoned with through the good
practice which will enable them to perform along a well dignified career
path. We would also be able to hold them accountable. [Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, we welcome the lifting of the ban on the
release of crime statistics by the Minister of Safety and Security.
However, the reasons as to why the moratorium on the release of crime
statistics was imposed by the Government in the first place remain unclear
and highly political.

What is certain is that the decision that inspired the ban was purely
political, as opposed to for scientific reasons, as advanced by the
Minister that the crime statistics gathered before 1994 was not reliable.
The reality is that the whole exercise was aimed at appeasing those who are
affected by crime, by creating the impression and perception that crime is
under control.

Circumstances surrounding the alleged plot on the life of the President and
the manner that it was publicly handled, clearly show that it was a well-
planned strategy to potential contenders to the throne of the ANC. What is
of major concern to us is the fact that different state security agencies
were mobilised to investigate the alleged plot.

We hope that the Minister of Safety and Security, as a leader in these
investigations, will soon make his formal findings public and justify the
use of the taxpayer's money by demonstrating beyond reasonable doubt that
his investigations had nothing to do with internal party squabbles.

When the Independent Complaints Directorate was initiated it was with a
clear mandate: to investigate any form of complaints lodged against the
members of SAPS by members of the public, especially the abuse of state
powers in relation to their work.

With the dawn of democracy the role of the SA Police Service had to change,
and indeed the method of policing also had to change. The police force had
to operate within the parameters of the Constitution. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, please lower your
voices, especially in that area there. [Interjections.] It is drifting
through right to here. [Interjections.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairman, the PAC wishes to express appreciation to the
SAPS for the hard work they are doing to combat crime under difficult
conditions. The PAC is satisfied that the budget allocated to the Ministry
of Safety and Security, if properly managed, could go a long way towards
bringing the scourge of crime in our country under control. The unbanning
of long-suppressed reports on crime statistics, called a moratorium, showed
that this Government has failed to deal with the cancer of crime.
Crime ranges from murder to rape, motor vehicle hijacking, killing of
farmers or police, or farmworkers ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Mr Smit, you are loud
enough for me to hear you. Please lower your voice.

Dr S E M PHEKO: I do not think that crime in South Africa can be compared
with recent racial riots in Britain. I think we will be making a big
mistake if we are going to compare crime in this country with that in
countries like Britain. We have to be realistic. [Interjections.]

More drastic steps must be taken against crime. Crime impedes the economy
of our country. It contributes to poverty and scares off foreign investors.
Even ambassadors in our country worry about their security and that of
their families and property. This tarnishes the image of this country
internationally. The country needs a well-trained, professional police
force, well-screened, to prevent undesirable criminal elements becoming
members of this important institution.

Police stations must be well-equipped, with working telephones and enough
police vehicles. The conditions of service for the police must be
attractive and their salaries improved more than those of members of
Parliament. There are police stations where police cannot even get police
uniforms. A demoralised police service will never bring crime under
control.

The PAC has pointed out several times that crime is a dangerous snake. It
does not need kisses, it needs hard kicks. [Laughter.] There must also be a
national campaign to teach communities that they have a role to play in the
eradication of crime in the country. They should expose criminals and not
welcome them as heroes. Crime in this country seems to be a chronic
disease, and seems beyond police capability.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Your time has expired. Hon
members, also of the New NP, lower your voices, please.

Mr M S BOOI: Chairperson, Minister and members of Parliament, I am
definitely sure you are wondering why Van Schalkwyk is not in the House at
this moment.

An HON MEMBER: Hon Van Schalkwyk.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, hon Van Schalkwyk.
Mr M S BOOI: Chairperson, all right hon Van Schalkwyk. The problem is that
he definitely knows that he has not said much. He does not understand what
he has spoken about. His role, at this particular moment, continues to
diminish, because his party has problems, and he himself, as a member,
also. We have known him as a Sayco, or SA Youth Congress, member. He has
never been able to play a significant role amongst young people. He is
supposed to be leading, and he has not been able to.

That is why, rather than dealing with the issues pertaining to crime, he
changes the debate about matters relating to the police to one about the
Minister. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Why do you not deal with those issues?

Mr M S BOOI: I am getting to that issue. I am definitely getting to it.
[Interjections.] The issue that makes them panic and makes them continue
losing direction is that when we, as the ANC, said that they should govern
in the Western Cape, we were very clear as to why we said that. We said to
them that they should attend to the affairs relating to the unicity. They
gave Mr Peter Marais the powers. The ANC knew what it was doing.

Today Mr Hennie Bester cannot solve the problem of gangsterism. He is stuck
with that problem. He knows that it is his problem. They definitely know
that they are stuck with that problem in this particular province. They
know that they cannot solve it. The ANC has been very clear on its policy
arrangements. The ANC says they should involve the communities where they
are. The problem that they have is that they do not even involve the
community of Mitchells Plain. They do not know what they are doing.

Mr Hennie Bester plays to the TV more than doing the work he is supposed to
be doing. Mr Peter Marais does not know what he is doing. He went to
Khayelitsha to open a pool. The people there did not even know who he was,
and asked who he was. The ANC councillors had to begin to take up the issue
to help Mr Peter Marais in that particular situation. I am consistently
saying that the DA knows that it is confronted with the situation that in
2004 they themselves will have to admit that they cannot govern in this
particular province.

They have failed the people of the province. They have made promises before
they came to power, ie they continuously said that they were going to beat
the gangsters. Sixteen-year-old kids and four-year-old kids are dying. What
is Hennie Bester doing? People are being attacked on the freeway. What is
Hennie Bester doing? He is doing nothing. They are making a noise. That is
why they are sitting with this problem.

Their own Leader of the Opposition comes here to make a noise about the
Minister. I am looking at his performance in the province. He is not
performing. That is the problem they are sitting with here.

Tony Leon goes to Britain because he cannot get the publicity he is looking
for. He goes about ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! It is ``the hon Tony Leon''.

Mr M S BOOI: Oh, I see. Hon Tony Leon, I even forget him. The point I am
making is that his performance has been very bad. He goes to Britain and he
realises that our performance in this country is better. He cannot even say
anything about crime. He says that he accepts the leadership of President
Mbeki and he has been able to see that Mr Mbeki is performing very well,
things that he cannot even say in this House. So what I am saying is that
there is a problem within the DP.

The hon Gaum comes here and makes a noise. I sit with him in a debate. I
challenge him to explain himself when he says the Minister is involved in a
plot. He sits there and reads the Sunday Times the whole day. The media
left and when it had left he started complaining. He comes here and makes a
noise in the House. I am challenging him and I have also been challenging
him in the portfolio committee to express himself. He does not understand
what he is talking about, challenging the Minister. He could not do it in
the portfolio committee because he does not have an understanding of the
issues that we are dealing with in Parliament.

Again, I am challenging Van Schalkwyk, the hon Van Schalkwyk, and I will
continue challenging him, to come and debate the process that we are
confronted with. I am saying to him: What are the issues that we have in
the portfolio committee which we are able to present? In relation to
stability, we have the portfolio committee.

I am saying to him that Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain are areas covered
in the Presidential Project. This is where we are supposed to be seeing the
DA's role. What can they do for the communities that are under attack? And
what I am saying is that throughout that project Hennie Bester has not been
seen. He takes 80 radios to go and dump in Mitchells Plain. He does not
care about the community of Khayelitsha.

They are now telling me that they have an MEC that is responsible, that is
able to take up the issues of crime. He is not doing that. That is why they
come here and attack the Minister.

They are attacking the Minister because he is performing. He knows what he
is doing. He has been able to turn around and reach the morale of the
police. He has been able to deal with issues of absenteeism. If the hon
member goes to Khayelitsha, where Shiburi is active as a director, where is
the provincial commissioner. They should ask him what he is doing, and he
knows the issues that are taking place in Khayelitsha. He came down,
deployed by the national commissioner, and he was able to turn round crime
in that particular area.

He has been able to interact with the community. He is the director that
walks up and down in that particular community. As a result, today the
community of Khayelitsha says that they are confident because there is
somebody who is responsible, and that the Presidential project is going to
be a success if it is implemented.
But, the provincial government, under hon Morkel, is unable to perform. It
is unable to go to Khayelitsha and bring the communities together and start
delivering on the Presidential Project. That is the criticism that they are
unable to take and put his party on track so as to be focused in order to
develop our own communities.

These are the issues that the hon member is supposed to say, that the
Minister, Mr Steve Tshwete, has not performed in respect of those issues. I
am saying that hon Morkel in this province is not performing, and continues
to take the direction of fighting amongst themselves rather than addressing
the issues that they are confronted with.

That is why today, I hear Morkel is coming here to read the issue. I am
saying that at no stage have they shown their performance record, and what
has happened in Khayelitsha is, in turn, the situation in the Western Cape.
What happens in Manenberg is that there is no interaction with the
community there. When it is voting time, the NP and hon Tony Leon and his
members start dancing in Manenberg.

The community is dying today, and nothing is being done by these hon
members. Nothing is being done by the Democratic Alliance as far as going
to that particular community is concerned. The Minister today outlined a
strategy of how to combat gangsterism. Gangsterism has been around for more
than 30 years when the hon member was in power under the apartheid regime.
Now that they are in power, they are unable to resolve it. It is
confronting them, but they are not even looking at it.

He should have watched SABC3 and seen how criminals conduct themselves in
prison. They are unable to find places to sleep. Now the hon member says we
must sort it out. How do we sort it out, because it is due to the hon
member's performance? What the hon member needs to do is to find out how to
meet the social needs of our people. He needs to be able deliver bread to
them and make sure Staggie does not hold the community at ransom.

Staggie is holding the community to ransom in Manenberg. The hon member is
not doing anything, be it with Christianity, or delivering bread to those
people. The hon member is not even making sure that they get their pensions
without Staggie having a say over their lives. The hon member is a coward
and afraid of Staggie.

The DA is able to go to him when they need him. They need him during voting
time, because he is their voting cow. Now, we are looking at them, when are
they going to make sure that Staggie stops gangsterism in this area? They
are not doing anything with regard to that issue. The hon member comes here
making a noise and starts shouting at the Minister. What is the hon member
doing in the Western Cape? Nothing. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, hon Minister, and hon Deputy Minister, the
main aim of the Department of Safety and Security is to prevent, combat and
investigate crime as well as to maintain public order. The MF condones Vote
23: Safety and Security and Vote 21: Independent Complaints Directorate,
which is also in keeping with the Security Industry Regulation Bill [B12 -
2001]  as well as the strategic plan 2000-2003 which outlines the key
activities of the SAPS for this period. The key activities that the SAPS is
focusing on includes organised crime, serious and violent crime, crime
against women and children, and improved service delivery at police
stations. All the aforementioned criminal activities are negatively
impounding on the economy of our country. The MF is appreciative of the
increased allocation of 8,9% to the Vote. It is believed that the
Government has reached its goal of reducing the amount of money spent on
personnel, so that money can be spent on key inputs such as vehicles, fuel
and oil and the renovation of physical assets.
The MF approves of the Independent Complaints Directorate Vote, since it
directly coincides with the Safety and Security Vote. The main aims of the
ICD are twofold, namely to investigate complaints of misconduct and
criminality committed in the police cells by some police and to propose
reforms to reduce the incidence of behaviour that gives rise to complaints.
The MF compliments the Independent Complaints Directorate (ICD) in its
obligation to investigate all deaths in police custody, as there have been
numerous such cases in KwaZulu-Natal. These incidents leave family members
not only devastated, but also in a state of shock and disillusioned as to
whom they can trust and consult when faced with a tragedy or problem.

The MF recommends that the budget allocation to the ICD be increased, since
the amount allocated is not sufficient for them to continue with their
current mandate and prioritisation. On the contrary, research has indicated
that 70% of the budget for the ICD is allocated for personnel expenditure
and only 30% is available for operational cost. The MF recommends that it
is necessary to re-evaluate the amount spent on personnel expenditure in
order to make more money available for running cost. This could be done by
re-evaluating the job levels and needs of the ICD.

The MF welcomes the budget allowance for a special salary dispensation for
SAPS members, as well as additional police personnel, since it is evident
that their jobs are not only extremely demanding, but also very risky. It
is also noteworthy that there is an increased amount of the budget that is
allocated towards administration due to the increasing use of computers.
This is compulsory in present society, as we are rapidly improving in the
age of information technology. The MF is confident that the amount in the
budget allocated towards programmes such as administration, the
investigation of complaints and monitoring and development would prove to
be fruitful in providing safety and security in our country. The MF
supports both budgets. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, 'n land kan die modernste Handves van
Regte hê, maar as misdaad ongebreideld voortduur, soos in Suid-Afrika, sal
niks tereg daarvan kom nie. Basiese regte, wat in die Grondwet verskans
word, word deur misdaad in Suid-Afrika tot niet gemaak. Hierdie regte sluit
in die reg op menswaardigheid, lewe, vryheid en sekerheid van persoon,
privaatheid, beweging, omgewing en eiendom.

Ons Handves van Regte lê in skerwe voor die misdadigers van Suid-Afrika.
Indien die staat dit nie in toom kan hou nie, staan hy skuldig teenoor die
Grondwet en dit is presies wat vandag in Suid-Afrika gebeur. Verlede jaar
het die agb Minister, in die debat oor hierdie begrotingspos, aangekondig
misdaad word onder beheer gebring. Hy het kritici beskryf as ``prophets of
doom''. Misdaadstatistiek is uiteindelik onder groot druk vrygestel en die
syfers toon daar was geen afname in misdaad nie. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, a country could have the most modern Bill of
Rights, but if crime continues uncontrolled, as in South Africa, nothing
will come of it. Basic rights, as entrenched in the Constitution, are
reduced to nothing by crime in South Africa. These rights include the right
to human dignity, life, freedom and security of the person, privacy,
movement, environment and property.

Our Bill of Rights lies in tatters before the criminals of South Africa. If
the state cannot control crime, it has transgressed the Constitution, and
that is precisely what is happening in South Africa today. Last year the
hon the Minister announced, in the debate on this Vote, that crime was
being brought under control. He described critics as prophets of doom.
Crime statistics were finally released, under great pressure, and the
figures indicated that there was no decrease in crime.]
Those prophets of doom have been justified again by the statistics of doom.
If one take into consideration the vast increase in the private security
business, the only justifiable conclusion is that the hon the Minister and
his department have made even less impact on the criminals in South Africa
than in the past.

The question is: What went wrong? If one looks at our overcrowded prisons
and the backlog on the court rolls, one should conclude that our police
have made more arrests, but the crime rate still has not come down.
Therefore the crucial problem is clearly in the area of crime prevention.
There is no better way of crime prevention than consistent, constantly
visible policing.

I clearly get the impression that the emphasis lies too much on once-off
hit-and-run squads and sporadically executed sweeping operations, instead
of continuous day-to-day operating in a planned and systematic way. I am
afraid the hon the Minister has failed South Africa in this regard. With
great expectations the hon the Minister took command of this very difficult
portfolio. He was, after all, known as Mr Fix It, as a strong man in the
ranks of the ANC. Today there is widespread conviction that he is not the
right jockey for this horse. The department needs a general, not a sergeant-
major. We need a manager, not a loose-cannon cowboy. We can add to this the
disastrous attacks on white women and the Portuguese community, as well as
the handling of an imaginary conspiracy. Clearly, I must present the hon
the Minister today with a CD, entitled ``Time to say goodbye''.
[Interjections.]

On the other hand, the hon the Minister is not the only one to be blamed.
Yes, I know that more money alone cannot solve everything, but surely, if
one looks at the vehicle situation, the personnel backlog and the
infrastructure, it is clear that the increase of 8,1% in the budget is not
sufficient and constitutes, in real terms, nothing more than 1,5%.

Dan is daar weer eens die kwessie van plaasmoorde. Die verslegtende
situasie skrei ten hemele. [Then there is again the question of farm
murders. This deteriorating situation cries to high heaven.]

It is reported on the Internet that 96 farmers were killed in 10 months,
which is about 10 murders per month.

Hierdie misdaad het nou 'n nuwe dimensie aangeneem. Ook die kinders van ons
boere het nou die teiken geword van hierdie gruweldade. Besef die agb
Minister hoe plofbaar hierdie situasie geword het? As kinders aangeval
word, kan hierdie kruitvat ontplof. Dit is eenvoudig so. Dan verdwyn
rasionaliteit, en rou emosie neem oor.

En wat doen die President as drie kinders wees gelaat word wanneer albei
hulle ouers vermoor word? Hy waarsku die boere om nie reg in eie hande te
neem nie. Waar is die boodskap aan die misdadigers? Hierdie eie reg gaan
gebeur, dit is besig om te gebeur en dit is op die Minister se rekening.

Die Minister het 'n taakspan aangestel om die oorsake van plaasmoorde te
ondersoek. Dit lyk my die agb Adjunkminister van Landbou en Grondsake meen
dit is nie nodig nie. Hy het klaar die antwoorde, want voor die boere op
Brits reken hy dat hulle politiek wil maak van die situasie as hulle
geopolitieke motiewe agter die plaasmoorde sien. Hy is nie nou hier nie,
maar ek wil vir hom sê hy kan maar reguit praat met ons boere. Hulle
verkies dit eerder as soetsappige stroperigheid, maar as hy mense wat by
die oop graf van hulle dierbares gestaan het van kwaadwillige politiekery
beskuldig, kom hy hulle ernstig te na.

Ek sluit af. As ons misdaad nie in toom kan hou nie, kan ons maar vergeet
van ekonomiese groei, van die Afrika-renaissance, van vrede en voorspoed en
van 'n ``better life for all''. Misdaad sal Suid-Afrika op sy knieë dwing.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This crime has now taken on a new dimension. The children of our farmers
have now also become the targets of these atrocities. Does the hon the
Minister realise how explosive this situation has become? If children are
attacked, this powder keg could explode. This is simply how it is. Then
rationality disappears and raw emotion takes over.

What did the President do when three children were left orphaned after both
their parents had been murdered? He warned farmers not to take the law into
their own hands. Where is the message to the criminals? Taking the law into
one's own hands will happen, it is already happening, and this is for the
Minister's account.

The Minister has appointed a task team to investigate the causes of farm
murders. It would seem to me that the hon the Deputy Minister for
Agriculture and Land Affairs is of the opinion that this is not necessary.
He already has the answers, because in the presence of farmers in Brits he
argued that they wanted to make a political issue of this situation if they
saw any geopolitical motives behind the farm murders. He is not here now,
but I would like to say to him that he can talk frankly to the farmers.
They prefer that to mealy-mouthed sugar-coating, but if he is accusing
people who have stood by the open graves of their loved ones of malicious
politicking, he is doing them a serious injustice.

I conclude. If we cannot contain crime, we can forget about economic
growth, about the African Renaissance, about peace and prosperity and about
a better life for all. Crime will bring South Africa to its knees.]

Just allow me an apology to the House, and to the Minister, that I will not
be able to stay for the rest of the debate and hear his reply due to time
constraints. I have another appointment already. I apologise for that.

Ms D M MOROBI: Chairperson, Minister of Safety and Security Comrade Steve
Tshwete, Deputy Minister of Safety and Security, before I start my speech,
I would like to pose a question to people on the left side of the House. I
just want to know whether they are South Africans. [Interjections.] If yes,
I urge them to sensitise their sense of belonging. They do not have to come
here and howl, when South Africans out there have put their trust in them
to be their mouthpiece. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The Independent Complaints Directorate was established in April 1977. Its
aim is to investigate complaints of misconduct and criminality allegedly
committed by members of the SA Police Service. Its vision, amongst other
things, is to ensure transformation within the SAPS, and also to promote
proper police conduct.

Under apartheid, the state maintained power and control over all aspects of
daily life. The legacy of apartheid, although declining, has by no means
disappeared. In the transition to democracy, South Africa needed to
dismantle all legislation and repressive mechanisms of authority and social
control, before building alternative mechanisms.

During this vacuum, lawless elements were able to flourish, resulting in
the highest rate of police misconduct and brutality. The national
priorities for 2000-2001 are as follows: death in police custody due to
police actions; police corruption; focusing on destruction of police
dockets and escape from custody; and police behaviour that is prohibited by
police regulations, such as neglect of duty, or failure to comply with the
code of conduct.

The ICD has the major task of investigating deaths in police custody,
whether the death occurred as a result of police action or negligence. In
the event of any evidence or suspicion of police criminality, the culprits
should be brought to book. The ICD takes charge of investigations and,
thereafter, hands the cases to the Director of Public Prosecutions with
recommendations. It also monitors these processes.

The investigation framework for the conduct of these investigations of
police brutality, misbehaviour, misconduct and negligence should also
consider broadening concerns which are relevant to the prevention of all
forms of misconduct and death in police custody. Priorities should also be
given to develop strategies to reduce the risk of death in custody by
police action, although most deaths are not due to police actions.

Chapter 10, section 50(4) of the SA Police Service Act, Act 68 of 1995
states, and I quote:


  All organs of state shall accord such assistance as may be reasonably
  required for the protection of the independence, impartiality, dignity
  and effectiveness of the directorate in the exercise and performance of
  its powers and functions.

Ha ho le jwalo, ho bohlokwa ho tla ka mokgwa wa tshebedisano-mmoho le
sepolesa. ICD e tshwanetse ho fumana ka moo e ka fihlellang tsela e
kgethehileng, ho phenyekolla le ho pepesa dipatlisiso tsa manyampetla a
tshwerweng ke diphaposi tsa Lekala la Sepolesa. (Translation of Sesotho
paragraph follows.)

[In that case, it is important to use the strategy of working together with
the police. The ICD has to find a special way to search for and expose the
corruption that is buried in the offices of the Police Service.]

The ICD should be vigilant in dealing with the problems of police crime and
misconduct. I also repeat what the other comrade has said. I will quote
from the speech of the President, Comrade Thabo Mbeki, in his state of the
nation address on 9 February 2001. Comrade Mbeki made a call. He said:


  ... we call on all our people across the colour line to dedicate this
  year to building unity in action for change.

Together with you, we need to speed up the change in order to fulfil or
achieve our dreams, as the ANC, of a crime-free South Africa. I call upon
members on the opposite side to drastically focus progressively on police
brutality, and its occurrence especially in the Western Cape.

The experience of most people in the rural and peri-urban areas is that
most police officers from Gauteng are not trained to do police work. They
treat victims of break-ins, rape and robbery with no sense of compassion,
understanding or sensitivity. In some areas they do not go to the crime
scene for days after being called out.

In Sir Lowry's Pass, a victim of a break-in apprehended a suspect and
located another. The police said they could not come at that time and
victims were afraid that the criminals would beat them. The DA must change
this.

An HON MEMBER: What was happening in Gauteng? [Interjections.]

Ms D M MOROBI: This is unacceptable. The DA has to change this, and it is
only then that the result will be a crime-free South Africa. Try to start a
dynamic action, as the DA, difficult as it might be for the DA to be
dynamic, especially since the DA is an alliance that is disunited,
disintegrating and also dissolving.

There are a number of cases the ICD attended to. I will only mention a few
cases. In KwaZulu-Natal, Comrade Bheki Mkhize, who was a member of this
Parliament, was brutally killed by the police for no apparent reason. The
docket was handed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The suspect was
charged with murder, and he will appear in court on 22-24 and 30-31 August
this year.

In another case in the Northern Cape, Gert Bergman was arrested on 15 July
2000. The following day, the 16th, it was alleged that he was discovered to
have hanged himself. The first postmortem revealed that the cause of death
was hanging. The Independent Complaints Directorate insisted on a second
postmortem by an independent doctor, who found the cause of death to be
multiple injuries. Without any doubt these multiple injuries were caused by
police action. The case has now been handed over to the DPP.

Re motjheng, ha re bua ka tshireletso ya setjhaba, ho fedisa botlokotsebe
ka hara naha. ANC ha esale e ena le tjhadimo le ponelo-pele. Ka la 26
Phuptjane 1955, ho ile ha thehwa Freedom Charter, eo ka motsotso ona re

``Ho tla ba le kgotso le tshireletseho ka hara naha''. (Translation of
Sesotho paragraph follows.)

[We are on the right track when we talk about community protection, to stop
crime in the country. The ANC has always had foresight. On 26 June 1955,
the Freedom Charter, which we are still relying on to this day, was
established. There is a line in the Freedom Charter which states: ``There
shall be peace and security in the country.'']

There shall be peace and security.

Mosotho wa kgale o ne a re molao o na le letsoho le le lelele. [A wise old
Sotho once said that the law has a long reach.]

The ICD is an institution that ensures the nation of South Africa of its
democracy and total transparency. Crime can be combated. I want to appeal
to the Minister of Safety and Security to ascertain that the budget of the
ICD has a fallback, so as to uplift the performance of that institution.

In closing, I want to thank the head of the ICD, Adv McKenzie, a woman, and
her team for a wonderful job well done. I support the Vote. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Adv P S SWART: Chairperson, seven years into democracy should be a time to
reflect on successes and prosperity. But there is a sour apple in the
``Trevor Fruit Basket'', leaving very little comfort. I shall offer what
little consolation there is.

Sitting out there is a group of people, the police, committed to ridding
this country of the scourge of crime imprisoning our citizens behind
burglar bars. They are easily identifiable in their blue uniforms, and I
pay tribute to every member of the SA Police Service, from constables to
the national Commissioner, for their dedication and hard work.

HON MEMBERS: Hear! Hear! [Applause.]

Adv P S SWART: The Commissioner should refrain from the plot investigation,
which may be a mud-in-the-face experience.

Commissioner Selebi made a political remark, that he cannot stand on Table
Mountain and shout for more money. That is precisely what he should do. He
is not providing leadership when at every police station his officers cry
out for more manpower, vehicles and resources to do their work and cope
with all the dockets, while he wastes time on grand plans and strategies.
He must empower them and he will be empowered.

There is another group, not in uniform or easily identifiable. They do not
sit together, and all do not belong to the same party, but they are
focused, across party boundaries, to oversee and actively play their role
in the ongoing fight against crime. This is the Portfolio Committee on
Safety and Security. Neither Dennis the Menace Bloem, who occasionally
shows up in his pathetic attempts to play the clown, ... [Interjections]
... nor senior ANC MPs and Whips, deployed to control us when high-profile
ANC party matters seem to be the issue, will curb our commitment and
diligence.

But, here the comforting stops! If the problem is our lack of focus or the
police's lack of commitment, why are things, with regard to crime, so sour?
People need a role model. Who better as a role model against crime than the
most senior person in this country engaged in crime fighting, namely the
political head? It should be a shining strong apple, at least sweet as far
as character goes. That is the problem with our fruit basket, the sour,
spoiled apple in our midst.
We normally regard a person who is rude, insulting and given to threatening
physical violence as either a thug or a low-life. It would be
unparliamentary for me to say ``thug'' and I am deferring from doing so. It
would be parliamentary for me to call the relevant Minister a ``low-life'',
but that would say something about my own manners and character, would it
not, so I shall also refrain from doing so. What I shall state, however, is
that he is failing our people and our country. [Interjections.]

Not only that, but I sincerely believe that the ANC, when not defending
their nondelivery to our people or clumsily trying to deal with corruption,
expensive vehicles, dissent from Cosatu or leadership plots, as a whole and
for the greater part, as individuals, is also committed to the fight
against crime.

Let me warn the Minister that he is also failing his own party.
[Interjections.] They may continue to defend him, unwillingly, while he
stumbles from crisis to crisis, badmouthing not only the opposition, but
even prominent comrades and veterans from the struggle, but they will only
do so up to a point. He is a runaway truck gathering disaster speed, and
the collision at the bottom of the hill may prove to be too much even for
him. [Interjections.]
We can only measure the performance of a department if it functioned
properly during the past year with the allocated money resources in terms
of its key objectives, in this case not building so many houses or
distributing welfare money, but ensuring that crime levels are brought down
to acceptable levels.

This brings us to the crime statistics. If the statistics are so
unreliable, how does his department plan and operate? We are regularly
briefed on how the plans are coming together and the success stories, like
Operation Crackdown, when at least 80% of people arrested walked out of
courts without being prosecuted. The statistics cover 20 crime categories,
yearly figures up to the end of 2000, and quarterly figures up to the end
of March 2001. On 18 May 2000 the Minister said in this House:


  The year 2000 will see South Africa's own renaissance in our fight
  against crime and we will succeed. Peace, stability and freedom from fear
  will prevail in our country.

We all applauded the Minister, but if the Minister understands by
``renaissance'' that the more things change the more they stay the same,
then indeed we had a mini-renaissance in the fight against crime, because
11 of the 20 categories show increases and the nine with decreases are
mostly by percentage points. On a quarterly basis, six indicated increases,
one stayed the same and again the decreases are for the greater part
minimal. For instance, murder per 100 000 people is down from 10,9 to 10,8.
Attempted murder stayed the same at 14,5%, whilst robbery with aggravating
circumstances increased from 55,7% to 61,4%. Noting the totals for the 20
categories, the truth is that, on a year-round basis, almost 106 000 more
people were victims of crime during 2000 - the Minister's renaissance -
than the year before, the most ever in our democracy. On 31 May 2001, just
a week ago, the Minister lifted the moratorium and told the media:


  I have no doubt in my mind that the SAPS is on top of the crime
  situation.

If the Minister calls the current situation with more and more people
falling victim to crime ``on top'', I can only decipher from what he said
last year in comparison to what he said last week, as a specific uncaring
message to all the millions of people out there who felt unsafe a year ago:
``I promised safety but I did not deliver. They should now feel less
safe.''

In financial terms this failure to achieve the key objective means that the
R15,7 billion Adjustments Appropriation for 2000-01 resulted in nothing but
the same crime levels, which a year ago the Minister regarded as
unacceptably high. Everybody today agrees, including the Deputy Minister.
That being the case, the new budget will do nothing more than preserve the
status quo, taking inflation into account.

But there is one thing to look forward to - the announced special provision
for extra vehicles to prevent the police fleet from total collapse, which
in real terms means that the SAPS should end this year with 67 more
vehicles than it started with, not much consolation for dedicated police
officers stranded without vehicles.

Another thin silver lining to this dark thundercloud is that, after
continuous pleas from the DA for more visible policing, there are now items
in Programme 2 called Visible Policing and Specialised Visible Policing.
[Interjections.] Let us hope that there will indeed be something
specialised about that.

I can spend the next five or even 50 sitting days of this House talking
about the killings of our brave police officers, murders of our farmers,
the very people providing us with food; the robbing and raping of tourists,
and other horror stories. I can tell the House of our police stations but
one should go and see for oneself, as we do, the lack of manpower
resources, general conditions and other problems impinging on the morale.
Frankly, I doubt if it would do anything to the Minister's apparent frame
of mind that he is on top of crime. For me, ``on top'' surely means ``in
control''.

The truth is that the problems are so big that indicating individual issues
will serve little purpose. We need a giant step both in physical allocation
and empowerment of our police officers so that the public will respect them
and criminals will fear them. I would like to tell the hon Minister that it
is time for him to regain, if this is still possible, the public's respect
and the criminals' fear, not the other way round. The decent part of our
public is afraid of him and fearful of his next blunder, and I am sure that
the criminals are laughing openly. It is time to inject the police with the
much-needed antibiotics to recover from this crime flu, and to use a big
dose while we are at it.

Speaking of low police morale, we must also attend to Vote 21, the
Independent Complaints Directorate. The portfolio committee already decided
our need to debate this directorate situation, financially and with
reference to their mandate. If the directorate is forced to stop
functioning just after the middle of the financial year because of lack of
funding, then something is seriously wrong. When we voted against this
budget allocation last year, we warned of this.

In conclusion, it is clear that both these budgets are crying out in their
insufficiency. The hon the Minister heard this time and again as this
debate progressed, and maybe, just for once, this House will fulfil its
role and not be forced by the majority to be the rubberstamp of a Minister
who should be thinking about resigning. [Applause.]

Mnr E T FERREIRA: Mnr die Voorsitter, soos reeds aangedui deur my kollegas,
sal die IVP hierdie begrotingspos steun. Alhoewel 'n mens baie maklik
kritiek sou kan lewer daaroor of die Regering genoeg geld op die
Polisiediens bestee al dan nie, sal dit oneerlik wees om nie te erken dat
die situasie aan die verbeter is nie. Die mediumtermyn-beplanning vir die
polisiebegroting is ook darem 'n aanduiding dat die Regering erns het met
wet en orde, al is hulle sukses maar effens beperk.

Aan die Minister spesifiek wil ek sê hy doen darem, tussen al sy foute
deur, 'n paar goeie dinge ook. Sy besoek aan funskionele polisiemanne en
-vroue sowel as aan families van polisielede wat vermoor is, word op
grondvlak geweldig waardeer. Sy uitsprake dat demokrasie en menseregte nie
in die pad moet staan daarvan dat misdadigers vasgevat word nie, is ook 'n
geweldige sielkundige hupstoot vir funksionele polisiemanne en -vroue, al
was dit 'n gevaarlike stelling om te maak.

As 'n mens in die middel- en laat neëntigerjare met polisiemanne op
grondvlak gepraat het, was hulle vuisvoos en sielkundig plat en hulle
moraal laag. Die afwesigheidsyfer was in daardie stadium daagliks tot 30%
hoog. Deesdae is dit af na tot 5%. Dit is so dat strenger beheer deur
polisiebestuur baie daarmee te doen het, maar beter moraal speel
ongetwyfeld ook 'n baie groot rol. 'n Mens kry die indruk dat die
polisiemanne en -vroue deesdae 'n bietjie meer lus is vir hulle taak om
misdaad vas te vat.

Daar is tans ongeveer 170 000 mense in Suid-Afrikaanse tronke. Dit is
feitlik dubbeld die hoeveelheid tronkinwoners in vergelyking met ses of
sewe jaar gelede. Daar was nog nooit in die geskiedenis soveel mense in
Suid-Afrikaanse tronke nie. Hulle het hul nie self by die tronke gaan
aanmeld nie - hulle is deur die SA Polisiediens in hegtenis geneem en daar
geplaas.

Die terreurveldtog wat die Wes-Kaap geteister het, het nie vanself feitlik
verdwyn nie. Dit is hierdie Polisiediens wat deur baie mense as vrot
afgemaak word, wat hulle vasgevat het. Dit is ook hierdie Polisiediens wat
die taxigeweld hier in die Kaapse Skiereiland vasgevat het. Hulle is nie
naastenby so sleg as wat hulle uitgemaak word nie.

Misdaad in Suid-Afrika is onaanvaarbaar hoog. Ons kan nie daaroor stry nie.
Dat misdaad ook nie werklik verminder nie, is 'n absolute feit, maak nie
saak hoe 'n mens met die syfers speel nie. Die Polisiediens kan egter
beswaarlik geblameer word as hulle die kriminele vang en die stelsel straf
die misdadigers nie genoegsaam nie. Dit is ook nie die Polisiediens se
skuld dat ons elke nou en dan met iemand se verjaardag ens kriminele
vrylaat nie. Nog minder is dit die Polisiediens se skuld dat die Staat
moordenaars en verkragters op belastingbetalers se onkoste kos en van die
beste mediese dienste gee.

Die koerante is hierdie week vol van gevalle waarin kriminele tydens
verskeie misdade deur die Polisie in hegtenis geneem of gedood is. Dit lyk
of die polisiemanne meer gereeld skiet en of hulle raakskiet. Enige sterfte
is werklik jammer, maar dit is baie beter om te hoor hoe die kriminele
sterf en om foto's van hulle in die koerante te sien as om polisiemanne wat
gesterf het se foto's in die koerante te sien.

Baie stadig, maar baie seker, is die Polisiediens besig om die gety te laat
draai. Die tekens is daar. Met die geld wat bewillig is om die ou voertuie
met nuwes te vervang gaan dit beslis nog beter gaan, al is dit maar 'n
klein stappie.

Twee kwessies wat egter nog baie kommer wek, is moord op polisiebeamptes en
plaasmoorde. Mense wat polisielede vermoor, moet genadeloos gejag word. 'n
Mens kry nog steeds nie werklik die indruk dat dit deur die staat as 'n
absoluut nasionale krisis gesien word nie.

Plaasmoorde sal geheel en al uit ons samelewing moet verdwyn. Die
versekering wat ons daagliks kry dat daar geen politieke motief agter
plaasmoorde skuil nie, is eenvoudig nie 'n troos nie. Alhoewel ons die
Regering se versekering hieroor graag wil aanvaar, gaan dit baie moeilik
wees om die publiek daarvan te oortuig.

Ek kan verskeie gevalle aanhaal waarin die oortreders die oggend nege-uur
op die plaas aankom, alles wat hulle wil steel en roof op die boer se
bakkie laai en dan die hele dag op die plaas braaivleis hou en kuier.
Wanneer die boer en sy vrou vieruur die middag huis toe kom, word hulle op
die wreedaardigste moontlike manier vermoor. Die moord duur dikwels ook 'n
baie lang tyd, en aan die beserings is dit baie duidelik dat dit baie meer
as doodgewone misdaad is.

Die feit dat 'n baie groot persentasie plaasaanvallers gevang en tronk toe
gestuur word, is nie 'n troos vir die familielede wat agterbly nie. Die
staat en die polisiediens sal baie meer voorkomend moet optree in hierdie
verband. Die boere en hulle werkers voorsien die oorgrote meerderheid van
Suid-Afrika se bevolking van kos, en voorsien ook baie uitvoerprodukte, wat
'n groot deel van ons ekonomie uitmaak. [Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr E T FERREIRA: Mr Chairperson, as already indicated by my colleagues,
the IFP will support this Vote. Although one could very easily level
criticism about whether or not the Government spends enough money on the
Police Service, it would be dishonest not to admit that the situation is
improving. The medium-term planning for the police budget is also an
indication that the Government is serious about law and order, even if
their success is slightly limited.

To the Minister specifically I want to say that, amid all his mistakes, he
is doing a few good things as well. His visits to functionary policemen and
women, as well as to families of police members who have been murdered, are
greatly appreciated on the ground. His statements that democracy and human
rights must not stand in the way of criminals being caught are also a great
psychological boost for functionary policemen and women, although it was a
dangerous statement to make.

If one spoke to policemen on the ground in the middle and late nineties,
they were punch-drunk and psychologically flattened and their morale was
low. At that stage the rate of absenteeism was as high as 30% daily. These
days it is down as low as 5%. It is true that stricter control by police
management has had a lot to do with it, but improved morale undoubtedly
also plays a very big role. One gets the impression that these days the
policemen and women have a slightly greater desire for their task of
combating crime.

There are currently approximately 170 000 people in South African prisons.
This is virtually double the amount of prisoners compared to six or seven
years ago. There have never been so many people in South African prisons in
our history. They did not report to the prisons themselves - they were
arrested and placed there by the SA Police Service.

The terror campaign which ravaged the Western Cape did not virtually
disappear of its own accord. It is this Police Service, which is denounced
by many people as being rotten, which captured them. It is also this Police
Service which tackled the taxi violence here in the Cape Peninsula. They
are not nearly as bad as they are made out to be.

Crime in South Africa is unacceptably high. We cannot argue about that. It
is also an absolute fact that crime is not really decreasing, no matter how
one plays with the figures. However, the Police Service can hardly be
blamed if they catch the criminals and the system does not punish the
criminals sufficiently. It is also not the fault of the Police Service that
every now and then we release criminals on somebody's birthday, etc. It is
even less the fault of the Police Service that the state provides murderers
and rapists with food and some of the best medical services at the expense
of taxpayers.

This week the newspapers are full of incidents in which criminals were
arrested or killed by the police during various crimes. It seems that the
policemen are shooting more regularly and hitting their targets. Any death
is truly a pity, but it is much better to hear that the criminals have died
and to see photographs of them in the newspapers than to see photographs of
policemen who have died in the newspapers.

Very slowly but surely the Police Service is turning the tide. The signs
are there. With the money which has been allocated to replace the old
vehicles with new ones, there is certainly going to be an even greater
improvement, even if it is just a small step.

However, two issues which are still cause for great concern are murders of
police officials and farm murders. People who murder police members must be
hunted down mercilessly. One still does not really get the impression that
this is viewed by the state as an absolute national crisis.

Farm murders will have to disappear entirely from our society. The
assurance we receive daily that there is no political motive behind farm
murders is simply no comfort. Although we would dearly like to accept the
Government's assurance in this regard, it is going to be very difficult to
convince the public of this.

I can quote various incidents in which the offenders arrived at the farm at
nine o'clock in the morning, loaded everything they wanted to steal and rob
on the farmer's bakkie and then spent the entire day on the farm braaing
and relaxing. When the farmer and his wife arrived home at four o'clock in
the afternoon, they were murdered in the cruellest possible manner. The
murder often lasts a very long time, and from the injuries it is very clear
that it was much more than common crime.

The fact that a very large percentage of farm attackers are caught and
imprisoned is no comfort to the family members who remain behind. The state
and the Police Service will have to act much more preventively in this
regard. The farmers and their workers provide the vast majority of South
Africa's population with food, and also provide many export products, which
constitute a big part of our economy. [Time expired.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, allow me to
address a misconception encouraged in some segments of the media, that many
members of Parliament do not fulfil their obligations with regard to being
in the House. As I look over the House now, I note just how many hon
members are in the House at this late hour, to be specific, 19:37 pm. I
trust that the unwarranted criticism in the media will be corrected.
[Applause.]

Mr M T GONIWE: Chairperson, and hon Minister Steve Tshwete, of whom we are
very, very proud, of course, if the DA criticises the hon the Minister,
then we must know that we are on course. If they praise the hon the
Minister, then the hon the Minister must pinch himself and realise that
something is drastically wrong. [Applause.]

The standpoint of the hon ``Onderbroek'' Van Schalkwyk should have been to
acknowledge the breakthrough in the extermination of terrorism in the
Western Cape.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member Gibson, are you
rising on a point of order?

Mr D H M GIBSON: Yes, I am, hon Chairperson. The hon person addressing the
House knows very well what the hon Mr Van Schalkwyk's name is. It is not
correct to address him in the way that he did. I suggest to the Chair that
it is unparliamentary and he should be instructed to withdraw it.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I have previously asked that
``hon'' should be attached when we refer to any member of this House. Would
the hon member please do that.

Mr M T GONIWE: Chairperson, I did, but I used his nickname.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I think ``the hon Van Schalkwyk'' is
the accepted mode of address in this House. [Interjections.] Would you
accept that, hon member, so that we can proceed?

Mr M T GONIWE: I do, Chairperson.

Instead of playing the ball, he played the man. [Interjections.] He should
have gone on to apologise to Minister Tshwete for having doubted a well-
considered opinion when the Minister asserted that Pagad was behind the
terrorism in the Western Cape. He could not do this, of course, because the
safety and security of the citizens of this country is the least of his
concerns. If it were not so, he could not have failed to acknowledge the
sacrifice by this Minister and members of the Police Service, some of whom
have paid the supreme price, to allow him to take this podium and display
his total disrespect, rudeness and utmost stupidity. [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

No small wonder that he sacrificed the New NP, which was well on course to
re-evaluating its approach. Just at that point, he sold it ``pens en
pootjies'' [boots and all]. [Interjections.] For what price? Just to become
Tony Leon's underwear. [Interjections.] The hon Tony Leon's underwear.
[Interjections.]

We must take this opportunity to congratulate the Commissioner of Police,
his deputy and all our men and women in blue on the increasing successes
they continue to register. [Applause.]

The DA has chosen a very unfortunate path. They have taken a conscious
stand to rubbish the gains South Africa - and the leadership of the ANC -
continues to make on all fronts. [Interjections.] They believe that the
shortest path to power is strategic confusion. [Interjections.] That
strategic confusion derives from a cynical longing for a past that shall
never return. [Interjections.] I stand a better chance of winning the Lotto
10 times than those hon members stand of becoming the government of this
country again. [Applause.] [Interjections.] God help us all if we imagine
President Leon? How scary! [Laughter.] Let it sink into their thick skulls
once and for all that they are not in power. They are not in power.
[Interjections.]

However, we must reiterate that the level of crime, especially of violent
crime, is much too high. It is unacceptable. [Interjections.] Communities
are definitely justified in complaining and urging for more drastic
measures to arrest the situation. Equally, we must recognise that steady
improvements in investigating corruption, smashing the syndicates behind
drug trafficking, and robberies and car hijackings, are being made. The
laws that are meant to close the gap on criminals are beginning to make a
visible impact. [Interjections.] Jails are bursting at the seams with
criminals, some of whom have already received stiff sentences.

It is because of these achievements, and many more, that we are confident
that we are on course. We can, with confidence, proclaim, as we do, that
the rays of dawn have begun to light up our horizon; that the light of
freedom is challenging the departing darkness of apartheid and that the
days of despair have given way to a season of hope.

Our President, Thabo Mbeki, captured it more succinctly when he said:
  ... gradually, step by step, our country proceeds further away from its
  painful past.

[Applause.] He went on to say:


  It is a past of the denial of freedom to the majority, of gross violation
  of human rights and repression, of entrenched sexism, a past of high
  levels of crime, violence and corruption.

Our Police Service is also a part of that past, but it has outpaced the
Democratic Alliance in changing and has become part of this unstoppable
march to democracy and equality. [Applause.]

Contrary to the wishes of the hon Tony Leon and his stooges, we are not
about to throw up our hands in despair in the face of robbers and
gangsters. More than anyone else, the criminals know that the battle-lines
are drawn and that their days are numbered. [Applause.] The kind of
criminal we are dealing with today is not as unsophisticated as the
criminals we are dealing with here, because they perpetuated ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Will you kindly
withdraw that, hon member? There are no criminals here. There are only hon
members here, hon member.

Mr M T GONIWE: Mr Chairperson, my time is moving on. I am left with only
two minutes.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, do not worry, you
still have time. Will you withdraw that? There are no criminals here. There
are only hon members.

Mr M T GONIWE: Well, Mr Chairperson, you did not even hear what I was
saying because I did not finish the sentence.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: But I heard the part where you said
there were criminals in this House. Will you withdraw that, hon member?

Mr M T GONIWE: I withdraw, reluctantly, Mr Chairperson, because I
understand ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, I do not want you
to qualify that. This is an important matter because it goes to the ...
Mr M T GONIWE: Very well. I withdraw it unconditionally, Mr Chairperson.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. You may proceed, hon
member.

Mr M T GONIWE: Apartheid was declared a crime against humanity. It was
perpetuated by some hon members of this House who participated and
benefited from apartheid. If ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Are you rising on a point of
order, hon member?

Mr D J SITHOLE: Mr Chairperson, would the hon member agree that those who
do not support the Bill are actually criminals?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Would you please come to the
microphone, hon member? In your request there is an insinuation. I want to
suggest to you that it is imperative, in a democratic parliament, that we
accept that there is integrity in each member who comes here, and we need
to preserve that integrity. I therefore request you to withdraw the
insinuation.

Mr D J SITHOLE: What I am saying, Mr Chairperson, is that I want to find
out from the speaker whether ... [Interjections.] I withdraw it, Mr
Chairperson.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I thank you. Please proceed, hon
member.

Mr M T GONIWE: Mr Chairperson, the dictionary definition of ``criminal'' is
``someone who commits crime''. If some hon members were unfortunately part
of apartheid, which was a crime, I am not sure what to call them.
[Laughter.]

Let me briefly come back to these attacks against the hon Minister Tshwete,
particularly by a young man such as the hon Gaum. The hon Gaum comes from a
culture ... [Interjections] ... in which our mothers' backs were
disrespectfully ridden by white kids in this country.

Babedlala umdlalo wokuqabela amahashe phezu koomama bethu. [They used to
get on our mothers' backs as if they were riding horses.]

That is why it is not odd for the hon member to attack and denigrate
persons older than his father in the rude terms that he used.
[Interjections.]

We have observed this thing, it is not a mistake. It is a well-planned
murder strategy which sends a message out there: ``If you are lily-white,
support us'', and ``Africans are not worthy of any respect''.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

All of a sudden ... [Interjections] ... the honourable opposition has
become so brave ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! [Interjections.] Order!
Order! [Interjections.]

Mr M T GONIWE: All of a sudden, under a black government, the hon member
has become ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Hon member, are you
rising on a point of order?

Mr V B NDLOVU: Yes, Chairperson.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, hon Ndlovu?
Mr V B NDLOVU: Chairperson, this is an honourable House. We cannot even
hear what the hon member is saying, we cannot hear what the other members
are saying.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I uphold your point and I want ...

Mr V B NDLOVU: We can all sing together, but we cannot speak together.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon member. I uphold your
point and I am ... [Interjections.]

Order! Hon members, there is nothing wrong with an interjection. An
interjection is part of the debate, but when it becomes a howling slanging
match then we are departing from the norm. I request you please to contain
your excitement and let the speaker continue.

Hon member, I am going to give you a few seconds to wind up.

Mr M T GONIWE: When draconian laws were passed in this House, the
opposition sat there like doves. All of a sudden, when laws taking this
country forward are being passed, they become hawks.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Let us hear the
Minister. [Interjections.] Is that a point of order? [Interjections.] Yes,
hon member?

Mr W J SEREMANE: Chairperson, I think I missed your eye. I stood up just
before the previous speaker left. I wanted to ask a question relating to
exactly what he said. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Unfortunately the member is no longer
here. [Interjections.] If it was a question ...

Mr W J SEREMANE: Chairperson, I am saying you missed me. It is regrettable,
because it relates to the decorum of this House. It relates to the very
tenets of democracy. In reverse we can be propagating the ills that have
been ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Hon member, the
difficulty is that the time of the hon member who was speaking has expired
and that is the end of that. [Interjections.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: I accept that. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. Order! Yes, hon member,
are you rising on a point of order?

Ms N E HANGANA: Chairperson, could you please make doubly sure that the hon
Mr Seremane has clean water in front of him? [Interjections.] [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Hon members, order!
Order! [Interjections.]

Considering the time, let us please get on with the business at hand. I
would like to ask that we do not pursue this further and give the hon the
Minister of Safety and Security the opportunity to speak. [Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Chairperson, I shall not sink to that low level.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. Yes, Minister, you may
proceed. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson, first of all I would like
to thank hon members Van Wyk, Ndlovu and Ferreira for the constructive
suggestions that they have put forward this afternoon. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

The MINISTER: It is quite clear in my mind that, when they came to this
House this afternoon, they knew pretty well that there was a serious
subject for discussion and consideration, and that suggestions were to be
made to Government as to how we should map our way forward to normalise the
situation in our country.

I want to assure them that the suggestions that they put forward are going
to be seriously considered by the department. The National Commissioner of
the SAPS and its top management are also here today, together with the
provincial commissioner. They also have taken count of what has been said
in these constructive contributions that I have alluded to here.

I am not surprised about the stance that the DA has taken this afternoon.
It is a clear demonstration to anybody who has ears to listen and eyes to
see that they have revealed their true characters today. [Interjections.]
They have never been, for a single moment, interested in the defeat of
crime in this country - never for one moment. [Interjections.]

Historically, the NP has been at the forefront in the creation of an
environment of crime and criminality, particularly when it comes to the
black people of this country. [Applause.] What has been said here is true,
that when the UN described apartheid, which the NP spearheaded, as a crime
not only against the black people of this country but against humanity,
they were making a direct statement to what the NP is. All of them, without
exception, have not changed. [Interjections.]

That is why, when we were being serious this afternoon, in saying that this
is the money that has been given to the Department of Safety and Security
and this is how it proposes to spend that money, the DA had absolutely no
interest in it. Because they are not serious and they have never been
serious about crime. [Interjections.]

Here is a classic example: One of them moved a motion this afternoon -
whoever she is - and in that motion she said that crime in the CBD in Cape
Town has dropped by 50%. [Interjections.] She is cheerful and happy -
typical white politics. [Interjections.]
I was with the Minister of Defence in Manenberg. The people in Manenberg
will never say that. The people in Manenberg have no reason to be jubilant.
[Applause.] It shows her mind-set that she sees crime only as far as it
affects the white community. They created those gangsters in Manenberg.
They are not saying a word about that sad situation in Manenberg, about the
people who are dying every day at the hands of the gangsters that they
created there. [Interjections.] It is because, at the end of the day, they
have no interest in Manenberg. [Interjections.] They are interested in the
white suburbs of Cape Town and the CBD. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, are you rising on
a point of order?

Mr I J PRETORIUS: No, I would like to ask whether the Minister ...
[Interjections.]

The MINISTER: Come, come, come with the question! [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! [Interjections.] Order! The
Chair wants to know whether you are rising on a point of order or not?
Mr I J PRETORIUS: Mr Chairperson, I am not rising on a point of order, but
I am asking whether the Minister is willing to take a question?
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, are you willing to take
a question?

The MINISTER: Yes, I will take the question.

Mr I J PRETORIUS: Mr Chairperson, can the Minister spell out the
competencies of the Ministers of security in the provinces?
[Interjections.]

The MINISTER: Mr Chairperson, he is asking about the competencies of a
Minister of security in the provinces, he should know that.
[Interjections.] He is a disgrace. He is an MP and yet he does not know
what the competencies of their men are, and he asks that question here! He
should know that. [Interjections.] The man over there knows what his
competencies are. The hon member knows that pretty well.

The point of the matter is that his leader here, the hon Van Schalkwyk,
decided to devote his entire time to a personal attack on me. I have
absolutely no problem with that. I would have been very worried if he had
attacked me politically, because he would have undermined the political
base of the party that is in power in this country, and that is going to be
in power for a very long time, and that they will never unseat.

I thought that perhaps I could reply and guide him. But he should just
trace his own character. Where does he come from? What did he do in the
dark days of apartheid? If there is one person who is not supposed to be
sitting here, who is supposed to be sitting elsewhere, outside this
Chamber, it is he.  [Interjections.] [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: It is you!

The MINISTER: You are unrepentant and arrogant!

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: You are arrogant!

The MINISTER: That is what you are. You are the physical embodiment of
arrogance. Apartheid arrogance is still there with you. That is what you
are. [Interjections.]

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: You are arrogant!

The MINISTER: If there is any person who is not supposed to be here, it is
you and your ilk. [Laughter.]

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: You do not belong here.

The MINISTER: The fact that today you are still able to speak here, hardly
ten years ... Some of us still have the wounds of your sjamboks on our
bodies. They have not healed. [Interjections.] You still have the audacity
to stand here and say all that you have been saying today. [Interjections.]
It is an indication that you are a study in arrogance. [Laughter.] That is
what you are. [Interjections.] You should not have been here.
[Interjections.]

You must thank your lucky stars that there is an organisation such as the
ANC which has been able to stand between the anger of the people and
yourself. You should never have been here. [Interjections.]

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: You should not be here. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER: You said that I stood here and attacked the Muslim community.

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Yes, you did.

The MINISTER: That is a blatant lie.

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: It is not.

The MINISTER: It is here. You can approach the Hansard. That is a blatant
lie. It is an indication ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order!

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is the hon member
allowed to say another member told a blatant lie? [Interjections.] It was
out of order earlier on.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, it is
unparliamentary. Would you please withdraw that?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson, it is
unparliamentary to say that a member has told a blatant lie. What I would
suggest is that perhaps the Minister could say that the member was guilty
of a terminological inexactitude. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER: Chairperson, I withdraw the statement. However, I will not
use that phrase, because he will never understand it. [Interjections.] What
I want to say is that that was an untruth. There is a written statement in
Hansard, and I even distinguished between Pagad and the decent Muslim
community in Cape Town.

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Only afterwards!

The MINISTER: Here from behind this podium I called upon them to isolate
Pagad. [Interjections.] I said that they were using the name of a great
religion for silly purposes. It is so easy for you to fabricate untruths,
because that is true to character, otherwise you are not yourself. One
friend of yours up here said that I also attacked members of the Portuguese
community.

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: You did!

The MINISTER: Again, that is an untruth. I wrote a letter to a specific
organisation, addressed to that specific organisation. I said to them that
that was what they were saying, and they were purporting to be
representative of the Portuguese community. Ever since then I have had
numerous meetings with many members of the Portuguese community who are not
going to confirm what you are saying there.

You made reference to unregulated use of powers, and how the FBI did that.
Again, it is an indication of the hon Van Schalkwyk's failure to root
himself in his own environment here at home. He did not have to go to the
FBI in the US. He just had to look at how he himself, a member of the New
NP and others in the New NP, in that regime, abused those powers of the
police.

I asked his friends in the portfolio committee to show me a single instance
where there has been abuse, one instance where I have abused state power.
They were never able to come up with that kind of thing. They were
repeating those things here because of their political bankruptcy.
[Interjections.]

Lastly, I want to thank the National Commissioner and the top management
for steering the South African Police Service onto these successful paths.
I want to thank the chairperson of the portfolio committee. He should be
entitled to a tolerance allowance for sitting in that portfolio committee
with some of these people. [Interjections.] And, of course, I thank the
executive director of the ICD.

I am tabling the unfinished part of my speech, including the ICD part of
it. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 20:04.
