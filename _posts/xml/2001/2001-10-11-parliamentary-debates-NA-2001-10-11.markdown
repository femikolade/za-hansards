Nkskz C I GCINA: Mhlalingaphambili, ndivakalisa isaziso sokuba, xa  le  Ndlu
ihlangana kwakhona, ndiza kuphakamisa, egameni leANC:


  Okokuba le Ndlu -


  (1) iqaphele  ngovuyo  nemincili  undwendwelo  kutsha  nje  lukaMongameli
       negqiza lakhe eJapan;


  (2) ikholelwa ekubeni amazwe angaphandle aneembono  ezintle  ngeli  lizwe
       lethu,  uMzantsi  Afrika,   yaye   amxabisile    kakhulu   uMongameli
       noRhulumente wethu;


  (3) ikholelwa ekubeni iimbono nezimvo  ezintle  ngeli  lizwe  zisisiphumo
       somgaqo-nkqubo omhle we-ANC osekelwe phezu kokudala  ubuntu  nothando
       phakathi koluntu, nokuphuhlisa uqoqosho ukuze kuhluthe bonke  abantu;

[Mrs C I GCINA: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -

       with his entourage;


  (2) believes that  foreign  countries  have  a  good  perception  of  our
       country, South Africa, and that they hold our hon President  and  our
       Government in high esteem;


  (3) believes that this is a result of the policy  of  the  ANC  which  is
       based on promoting humanity and love among people, and developing the
       economy so that poverty could be eradicated and all the people  could
       have a good life; and


  (4) praises the hon President and the Government  for  their  efforts  in
       trying to develop the economy and creating jobs.

The House says: Forward with the good work! [Applause.]]

Dr J T DELPORT: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1)  notes  with  concern  the  findings  of   the   Auditor-General   of
       irregularities and possible fraud  in  the  deposit  account  of  the
       Department of Justice, an account which handles more than R2  billion
       in public money every year;


  (2) further notes that the Auditor-General refers to -


       (a)  staff incompetence;


       (b)  failure to act against nonperforming staff;


       (c)  improper internal controls;


       (d)  money not properly accounted for; and


       (e)  the risk of substantial fraud;


  (3) expresses its concern that the Auditor-General believes it will  take
       more than five years to correct these problems; and
  (4) calls on the Minister for Justice and Constitutional  Development  to
       address this situation or resign.

[Interjections.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that  the  proposal  to  reintroduce  railway  police  officers
       trained to deal with railway-related crime  is  under  consideration;
       and


  (2) further notes that hopefully the reintroduction of railway police, if
       the proposal is accepted, will -


       (a)  result in a decrease of crime committed on trains; and


       (b)  give more people the confidence to make use of the trains.

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes  that  President  Thabo  Mbeki,  together  with  other  African
       leaders, had a meeting with the European Union  to  discuss  the  New
       Africa Initiative;


  (2) reports that the European Union supported the New  Africa  Initiative
       enthusiastically after this meeting;


  (3) further notes that -


       (a)  the European Union committed itself to  a  twice-a-year  meeting
           with the initiative's steering committee and further decided  to
           establish a permanent link between  the  New  Africa  Initiative
           task forces; and


       (b)  this agreement was made possible by the central role  played  by
           President  Thabo  Mbeki  with  the  support   of   his   African
           counterparts;


  (4) believes that this agreement is the first of its kind  since  African
       leaders joined forces and  pledged  a  common  vision  and  a  shared
       conviction  to  ensure   the   continent's   sustained   growth   and
       development;


  (5) further believes that  the  success  of  the  New  Africa  Initiative
       depends  on  the  constructive  partnership  between  the   developed
       countries and the continent, which is founded on the  realisation  of
       common interest, benefit and equality; and


  (6) commends the European Union for supporting the New Africa Initiative.

Adv A H GAUM: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that  Government  has  timeously  reversed  its  ill-considered
       decision  to  ban  foreign  involvement  in  South  Africa's  private
       security industry;


  (2) observes that serious  damage  to  South  Africa's  reputation  as  a
       country that welcomes foreign investment and supports free enterprise
       has been narrowly avoided;


  (3) applauds Minister Tshwete for heeding the urgent appeals  of  the  DA
       and others in this matter, and urges the Minister of Finance and  the
       Minister of Trade and Industry to take a strong  interest  when  such
       misguided  and  ill-informed  actions  so  severely  threaten   South
       Africa's trade prospects; and


  (4) notes that  the  resolution  of  this  matter  in  this  way  further
       emphasises  the  important  role  of  the  DA  as  a   clear-thinking
       constructive and effective opposition in Parliament.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Miss O N MNDENDE: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) conveys its condolences and sympathy to the family of  Ms  C  Mamfene
       Johnson who was a UDM and Civic member  in  Samora  Machel,  who  was
       gunned down last night in an apparently politically motivated attack;




  (2) is deeply distraught that, despite constitutionally guaranteed rights
       to freedom of association and expression, South Africans continue  to
       be killed because of their political views;


  (3) acknowledges that the UDM is aware of the strain on  the  police  and
       the courts, but that the UDM is increasingly uncomfortable  with  the
       slow pace of investigations into the matters pertaining to the deaths
       and continued killing of UDM members; and


  (4) expresses its concerns regarding the apparent incapability or perhaps
       even worse, the  unwillingness  of  the  ANC  to  teach  its  members
       tolerance and peaceful political dialogue.

[Applause.]

Ms N D NGCENGWANE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the ANC Women's League  holds  a  consultative  conference
       over this weekend, starting today;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  the consultative conference theme is ``Women  marching  together
           into the African Century"; and


       (b)  the conference will  be  attended  by  800  delegates  from  all
           structures of the women's congress movement,  the  international
           friends of the ANC Women's League, high commissioners of various
           countries in South Africa and local sister organisations; and


  (3) wishes the ANC Women's League well in its deliberations  during  this
       conference.

Igama  lamakhosikazi  malibongwe!  Wathint'  abafazi,   wathint'   imbokodo,
uzakufa! [The women should be praised! When you strike a woman,  you  strike
a rock!]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with great concern that -


       (a)  the deadline given to the general public to comment on  the  new
           draft revised Curriculum 2005 is Friday, 12 October 2001;


       (b)  a great many public institutions such as the governing bodies of
           schools, public libraries, colleges and universities do not have
           access to a hard copy of the 1 400-page revised  curriculum  and
           therefore cannot respond before the prescribed deadline;


       (c)  although the document in question is dated  30  July  2001,  its
           actual availability is questionable; and


       (d)  although the document is available on the Internet  and  can  be
           downloaded, the printing of 1  400  pages  is  a  laborious  and
           costly exercise, and  the  Internet  is  still  an  unaffordable
           luxury to the vast majority of South African citizens; and


  (2) therefore calls on the Minister of Education to -


       (a)  extend the deadline for inputs to 31 December 2001;


       (b)  ensure that at least every school governing  body,  college  and
           university has a hard copy of the controversial Curriculum  2005
           ...

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, ek  gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag namens die AEB sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat die AEB 'n beroep doen  op  alle  Suid-Afrikaners  om
       hulle volle samewerking te gee met die sensusopname wat gister  begin
       het;


  (2) van mening is dat die sensus  noodsaaklik  is  vir  sowel  effektiewe
       regering  as  vir   die   ordelike   funksionering   van   burgerlike
       organisasies;


  (3) glo dat die lede van elke gemeenskap moet weet dat deur nie getel  te
       word nie, jy net jou eie gemeenskap benadeel;


  (4) in die lig van die veiligheidsituasie op plase, 'n spesiale beroep op
       sensusopnemers doen om konsekwent vooraf afsprake te maak vir besoeke
       en sowel hulself as hul voertuie duidelik te identifiseer; en


  (5) sy afkeur uitspreek oor die onsinninge en inkriminerende reëling  dat
       elke sensusopnemer met vier kondome toegerus word en vra dat die  agb
       Minister  sal  kennis  neem:  ``Dit  is  'n   belediging   vir   elke
       sensusopnemer. Hulle wil tel, meneer, hulle wil nie teel nie!''

[Gelag.] (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the AEB:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note that the AEB appeals to all South Africans to  give  their
       full co-operation to the census survey which started yesterday;


  (2) is of the opinion that the census is  essential  both  for  effective
       governance and for the orderly functioning of civil organisations;


  (3) believes that the members of every community should be aware that  by
       not being counted, they will only prejudice their own community;


  (4) in view of the safety situation on farms, makes a special  appeal  to
       enumerators consistently to make appointments  to  visit  beforehand,
       and to identify themselves and their vehicles clearly; and


  (5) expresses its disapproval of the absurd and incriminating arrangement
       that every enumerator will be furnished with four condoms,  and  asks
       the hon Minister to note the following: ``It is an  insult  to  every
       enumerator. They want to count people, sir, not breed!''

[Laughter.]]
Mr M T GONIWE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  yesterday, 10 October, was the  World  Day  of  Solidarity  with
           Cuba; and


       (b)  the South African Friends of Cuba Society, in a joint initiative
           with the  Cuban  Embassy,  hosted  a  gala  performance  at  the
           Waterfront to celebrate the event, and will also  host  a  Cuban
           film festival which will give the public  an  insight  into  the
           origins, history and morality of the Cuban revolution;


  (2) believes that the Government and the people of Cuba continue to serve
       as an inspiration of progressive values of international  solidarity,
       freedom and equality; and
  (3) joins progressive internationalists in celebrating the World  Day  of
       Solidarity with Cuba and reiterates its belief that the  struggle  of
       the people of Cuba to end the US  blockade  is  our  struggle  for  a
       better continent and a better world.

[Applause.]

Mr R JANKIELSOHN: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Minister of Safety and Security,  through  an  answer  to  a
           parliamentary question, has confirmed that the SA Police Service
           are investigating allegations of fraud and intimidation  against
           ANC member of Parliament, Mr Bheki Radebe;
       (b)  these charges have been laid by members of  the  community  from
           Thembalihle in Vrede who  are  fed  up  with  the  ANC's  broken
           election promises;


       (c)  these people, many of whom are unemployed and pensioners,  could
           lose their property as a result of these actions; and


       (d)  this proves that the ANC's Batho Pele  campaign  is  laced  with
           ambiguity; and


  (2) calls on the SA Police Service to carry out a thorough  investigation
       into these allegations and bring Mr Bheki Radebe to justice.

[Applause.]

Mr M T GONIWE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order! Is this motion  which  is
being moved about some member we do not know not a substantive issue?

The SPEAKER: Order! Well, I am not going into whether it is  a  member  that
you know. The Rules are clear. What we have heard in the past  few  days  is
members trying  to  raise  issues  which  should  be  raised  by  way  of  a
substantive motion as a notice of motion. I have written to the  member  who
did this two days ago to ask that if it is a substantive motion,  it  should
be tabled in the House, and not simply raised as a notice of motion. I  will
follow that up in this case as well. [Interjections.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, with  all  due  respect,  in  respect  of  the
notice of motion just moved, in this instance the member,  as  I  heard  it,
simply referred to an action taken by a prosecuting authority and  was  not,
in fact ...

The SPEAKER: Order! Thank you, Mr  Andrew.  I  said  I  would  look  at  it.
[Interjections.] I am not going to comment on something  that  I  have  just
heard. Please proceed, hon member.

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:
  That the House -


  (1) is concerned about the level of toxicity under which the residents of
       the Clairwood shack settlement in Durban live  as  a  result  of  the
       industrial railway line transporting a variety  of  deadly  fuel  and
       chemical products for the Engen and Sapref refineries, and for  Mondi
       and Bayer;


  (2) regrets that some children as young as 15 years old suffer  and  have
       died as a result of lung disease due to an underground  leak  of  750
       000 litres of petrol from Shell and Sapref refineries;


  (3) calls upon these refineries to rectify the problem so that the  lives
       of the indigent residents could be spared; and


  (4) requests the Durban Metro Council to allocate decent  land  to  these
       residents to ensure quality of life.

Mr J H NASH: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Meadowlands Police Station  and  Garankuwa  Hospital  have
       been nominated in the Public Service category of this year's National
       Productivity Award;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  the management at the police station concentrated  on  improving
           existing resources by concentrating  on  capacity-building,  and
           extended  its  crime-prevention  capacity   through   systematic
           involvement of the community in crime prevention; and


       (b)  the hospital had to overcome serious obstacles  by  reallocating
           resources and providing computer training for its staff members;
           and


  (3) congratulates both Meadowlands Police Station and Garankuwa  Hospital
       on being nominated for this year's National Productivity Award in the
       Public Service category.

[Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the latest  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  shows  that
       provinces have been closing  their  eyes  to  the  human  misery  and
       destruction being wrought by HIV/Aids, and that they  have  therefore
       failed to plan adequately for managing the epidemic, particularly  in
       the key fields of health, social welfare and education;
  (2) urges the Government to accept that HIV/Aids is a reality that cannot
       be avoided, and to recognise that failing to act  leads  directly  to
       the deaths of thousands of South Africans every week; and


  (3) calls on  the  Government  to  therefore  implement  concrete  plans,
       including a mother-to-child HIV transmission prevention programme, to
       reduce the number of  South  Africans  who  become  victims  of  this
       disease.

                      TAKE PART IN PARLIAMENT CAMPAIGN

                             (Draft Resolution)

The ACTING CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I  move  without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Parliament has  launched  the  "Take  Part  in  Parliament
       Campaign" the purpose of which is -
       (a)  to promote an understanding of Parliament;


       (b)  to educate and inform the South African public of  what  happens
           in Parliament;


       (c)  to educate the public on how laws are made; and


       (d)   to  educate  the  people  of  South  Africa  on  how  they  can
           participate in the lawmaking process, in  order  to  promote  an
           increased awareness of -


           (i)   Parliament;


           (ii)  how it functions; and


           (iii) how laws are made,


       so that the people of our nation are better able to  participate  in
       the legislative process and are  better  informed  on  issues  around
       which key legislation is being developed;


  (2) therefore applauds this initiative of Parliament; and


  (3) calls on all Members of the House to take this  campaign  into  their
       constituencies so that they are better able to serve the  people  and
       the nation.

Agreed to.

                       BEST WISHES TO MATRIC STUDENTS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) wishes all matric students well in their final examinations; and


  (2) believes that their hard  work  over  the  past  year  will  lead  to
       successful results.

Agreed to.

                      ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT COMMITTEE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The ACTING CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the
draft resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That the House, subject to the concurrence of  the  National  Council  of
  Provinces, establishes a joint committee in terms of Joint  Rule  111  to
  consider the Revenue Laws Second Amendment Bill, 2001.

Agreed to.

                     FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE CENTRE BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)
The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, hon members, today I  introduce  the
Financial Intelligence Centre Bill to Parliament  for  its  Second  Reading.
Hon  members  are  asked  to  consider  the  introduction  of  an  extensive
antimoneylaundering regime into our legislation. The Financial  Intelligence
Centre Bill is placed before hon members today after a thorough  process  of
discussion, research and drafting over the past four years.

This Bill has been long in finalising, to the frustration,  I  am  sure,  of
some people. However, what we have before us today  compares  with  some  of
the best and most comprehensive  antimoney-laundering  legislation  anywhere
in the world.

The Financial Intelligence Centre Bill is the  product  of  a  comprehensive
consultative process involving the SA Law Commission, a task team  appointed
by the Ministry of Finance, all  major  stakeholders  in  South  Africa  and
international  bodies  such  as  the  Financial  Action  Task   Force,   the
Commonwealth Secretariat, the UK's National Criminal  Intelligence  Service,
the US department of justice and the US treasury, and Australia's  FIU,  and
Austrac - the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre.

Accordingly, the Financial Intelligence Centre  Bill  draws  extensively  on
international best practice and provides our Government with  the  tools  to
play an  important  role  in  combating  all  manner  of  money-  laundering
activities. A number of institutions and  individuals  made  representations
to the committee hearings. We have listened carefully  and  have  sought  to
ensure that all of these concerns have been fully taken into account in  the
final drafting of the Bill.

The Bill is also the product of a very  constructive  joint  effort  by  the
Portfolio  Committees  on  Finance  and  on   Justice   and   Constitutional
Development. I would like to thank the chairpersons of these committees  and
their members for the very significant effort  they  put  into  hearing  and
accommodating public comments on the Bill, interrogating the  rationale  and
thinking behind its provisions and making appropriate amendments. I have  no
doubt that the Bill, which is now before  the  House,  is  a  much  improved
product and the product of a thoroughly democratic process.

The Bill complements  the  Prevention  of  Organised  Crime  Act  which  was
adopted by Parliament  in  1998.  The  Prevention  of  Organised  Crime  Act
specifically   criminalised   money-laundering   and   required   suspicious
transactions to be reported to the commercial crime branch of the SAPS.  But
the Prevention Organised Crime Act fell  short  insofar  as  establishing  a
dedicated financial intelligence unit  to  interpret  those  reports  or  to
monitor compliance with those reporting obligations is  concerned.  Nor  did
it  impose  the  relevant  know-your-client  training   and   record-keeping
obligations in respect of those sectors which are believed to  be  the  most
susceptible to money-laundering. These deficiencies  are  rectified  in  the
Financial Intelligence Centre Bill.

Money-laundering activities are undertaken by those  who  wish  to  disguise
the source of ill-gotten gains, for example money or property, rendering  it
legitimate and  often  taxable  income.  Money-laundering  is  one  way  for
criminals to ensure that crime pays.

As defined in the Bill, money-laundering means an  activity  which  has  the
effect of converting the proceeds of unlawful activity,  and  of  disguising
the nature and the source of the money and the ownership thereof.

The money-laundering process is typically broken  down  into  three  phases:
placement, when the illegal or dirty money  is  placed  into  the  financial
system; layering, when the criminal tries to obscure the  link  between  the
funds and the illegal activity through a number of complex  transactions  to
obscure its true origin, and integration, when the  funds  are  reintegrated
into the financial sector again so that  it  appears  to  be  legitimate  or
clean money, and in so doing it ends up as profit for  the  criminal.  After
the funds are clean, the criminal often moves the now legitimate funds  into
mainstream economic activities, such as business  investments,  real  estate
or luxury goods.

We also know that money-laundering is often associated  with  various  forms
of tax evasion. Money-laundering and tax evasion are often two sides of  the
same coin. This might explain why it is often said that  the  term  ``money-
laundering'' originated in Chicago during the 1930s  with  the  tax  evasion
activities of Al Capone.

However, the term money-laundering was first used more recently,  and  in  a
more political context, to  describe  the  nefarious  movement  of  campaign
funds during  the  Watergate  scandal  involving  President  Richard  Nixon.
Antimoney-laundering  steps  involve  the  ``paper  trail''   of   financial
transactions seeking to disguise ill-gotten gains from criminal  activities.
``Follow the money'', was the advice of ``Deep Throat'', the  key  informant
of the Washington Post reporter investigating the Watergate  scandal.  This,
too, is the philosophy adopted by the Financial  Intelligence  Centre  Bill.
[Interjections.]
Is  that  hon  member  listening?  I   can   hear   what   he   is   saying.
[Interjections.] Thank you.

However, money-laundering and the legislation introduced today  takes  on  a
new meaning in the wake of the post  September  11  attacks  on  the  United
States and the events unfolding in the Middle East.  No  longer  can  money-
laundering be understood only as hiding and moving the proceeds of  unlawful
activity, such as drug trafficking, but it must include  those  funds  which
are intended for terrorist activity as well.

What are the estimates of money-laundering? Owing to the secretive  and  the
disguised nature of laundered funds, the worldwide value  is  not  precisely
known. Michel Camdessus, the former managing director of  the  International
Monetary Fund, has estimated that the magnitude of money laundered  globally
annually is equivalent to 3% to 5% of the world's  gross  domestic  product,
or at least some US$ 600 billion. Using 1996 statistics, the value of  money
laundered ranged between US$ 590 billion to  US$  1,5  trillion.  The  lower
figure represents the nominal total output of an economy the size of  Spain.
The Financial Action  Task  Force  estimates  the  value  of  global  money-
laundering at around US$ 300 billion to US$ 500 billion.

South Africa is no exception. Although there is no conclusive study and  the
opinions vary, we understand that anything between 2 US$ billion and  8  US$
billion is laundered through South African institutions every year. We  need
to understand what the money-launderers already do. We live in a  globalised
village in which  national  borders  are  easily  crossed,  increasingly  by
almost  instantaneous  electronic  means,  by   individuals   and   criminal
organisations who wish to move money around the globe to avoid scrutiny.

The problem with money-laundering is that it has a corrosive effect  on  the
country's economy, its government and its social wellbeing. The practice  of
money-laundering distorts business decisions, increases  the  risk  of  bank
failures and creates liquidity problems in financial markets. Owing  to  the
quick flow of laundered or hot money, it takes control  of  economic  policy
away from Government, making policy  objectives  difficult  to  achieve.  It
harms the country's reputation and exposes its people to  crime  syndicates,
drug trafficking, smuggling and other criminal activities.

Owing to increased activities by authorities  in  developed  nations,  crime
syndicates are shifting their  activities  to  emerging  markets  which  are
perceived to be not  well  regulated.  Emerging  markets  that  are  in  the
process  of  opening  their  markets   or   liberalising,   are   especially
susceptible.

The cumulative effect of laundering activities destabilises the  foundations
of a nation's financial system. Money-laundering diminishes tax  revenue  to
the  fiscus  and  thereby  indirectly  harms  honest  taxpayers.  It   makes
Government's tax collection procedures  far  more  difficult.  The  loss  of
untaxed revenue generally means higher tax rates  for  law-abiding  citizens
and corporates than would be the case if the untaxed proceeds of crime  were
legitimate.
With this Bill therefore we intend to interrupt the cycle used by  organised
criminal groups to benefit from illegitimate profits. We shall use the  Bill
to maintain the integrity of the South  African  financial  system  we  have
struggled so hard to build.

We know that money-laundering is undoubtedly taking place in  South  Africa,
because we have organised criminal groups who  need  to  rid  themselves  of
money they have obtained illegally from the sale of drugs and  bank  heists.
We also have a well-developed financial system through which the  funds  can
be processed. To date, however, there have been few prosecutions for  money-
laundering activities, and part of  the  reason  is  that  these  have  been
difficult to monitor and trace. We have not had the regulatory means at  our
disposal to measure more accurately the amounts of money which move  through
our institutions, but things are changing.

The object of this Bill is to introduce mechanisms  and  measures  aimed  at
preventing  and  combating  money-laundering  activities.  It  sets  up   an
antimoney-laundering regime which encourages voluntary compliance and  self-
regulation by institutions which  otherwise  may  have  been  exploited  for
money-laundering purposes. To this extent, the Bill  complements  and  works
with the Prevention of Organised Crime Act.

The Bill establishes a Financial Intelligence Centre which will  co-ordinate
policy and Government's efforts to counter money-laundering  activities.  In
terms of section 195 of the Consitution the centre will be  located  outside
the Public Service but within administration. It will be accountable to  the
Minister of Finance and will be funded mainly from the national Budget.

The centre will bring together all  financial  intelligence  data  into  one
single repository for analysis before passing this  information  on  to  the
law enforcement agencies for further investigation and prosecution. It  will
be headed by a director who will be the accounting officer in terms  of  the
Public Finance Management  Act,  and  will  be  independently  staffed  with
specialists, including secondees from various law enforcement  agencies  and
the SA Revenue Service.

The  Bill  creates  a  new  legal  category  of  accountable  and  reporting
institutions, which refer to the companies and businesses which we  consider
to be the most vulnerable to money-laundering  activities.  It  sets  out  a
range of obligations  on  these  institutions.  They  will  be  required  to
implement internal administrative systems to ensure  that  they  know  their
customers, report suspicious and certain cash transactions, keep records  of
their  customers  and  the  transactions  they  were  involved  in,  appoint
compliance officers and train employees to comply  with  the  provisions  of
the Bill.

Implementing  these  measures  will,  of  course,  prove  costly  for   some
institutions. But we believe that we  have  the  support  of  South  African
institutions in stamping out money-laundering in South Africa and that  they
will tackle the difficult task of having to comply with these provisions  in
the spirit intended by the Bill. This Bill has  long  been  in  the  making,
and, most importantly, we are creating a climate  of  compliance.  The  time
has come when institutions  can  no  longer  evade  their  legal  and  moral
responsibilities in respect of people who use their  services  for  criminal
financial activities. The Bill will help bring oversights  to  an  end,  and
the Government intends enforcing it to the letter.

While on this matter, I need to point out that in Chapter 5 of  the  Bill  a
range of offences are identified and very onerous penalties imposed  in  the
event of transgressions by accountable institutions.  The  offences  include
the failure to identify clients, not keeping records for a  period  of  five
years,  and  not  reporting  cash  transactions,   suspicious   or   unusual
transactions. A person found guilty of any of these offences  is  liable  to
imprisonment for a period not exceeding 15 years or  a  fine  not  exceeding
R10 million. I am sure that in the near future these will be  known  as  the
Johnny de Lange clauses. The Bill sends out a very  clear  message:  We  are
serious about implementing an antimoney-laundering regime in this country.
The  Deputy  Minister  will  talk  about  some   of   the   provisions   and
implementations of the Bill in more detail. However, I  need  to  point  out
that the National Treasury has dedicated capacity to ensuring that  the  FIC
is established as soon as possible. A process is already under way to  draft
the regulations according to the sequence in which different  parts  of  the
Bill will be enacted. It is anticipated that the first phase  will  be  from
June next year, when banks will be required to know  their  clients  and  to
start reporting suspicious and  unusual  transactions.  Full  implementation
will  be  completed  three  years  hence,  once  an  electronic  transaction
reporting institution has been phased in.

In summarising, I wish to reiterate  that  the  legislation  before  members
today  is  amongst  the  most  comprehensive  antimoney-laundering  measures
anywhere in the world. It draws on international  best  practice  and  gives
South Africa the means to combat all manner  of  money-laundering  activity.
We are serious about identifying those who are  involved  in  this  activity
and in bringing them to book.

In conclusion, I wish to thank all those who  have  been  involved  in  this
process, the Task  Team  into  Money-laundering,  the  chairperson,  Mr  Max
Coleman, Mr Mark Phillips and Mr Pieter Smit, who have stuck with this  task
through the years. We welcome the  vigorous  and  intense  debate  that  the
passage of this Bill has generated.

I wish to thank all those institutions and individuals who made  the  effort
to present their  views  to  the  portfolio  committees  during  the  public
hearings. Their views have, where  possible,  been  taken  into  account.  A
number of international bodies have been of  major  assistance.  I  wish  to
single out the Australian High Commission and Austrac for special thanks.

I especially want to thank  the  Portfolio  Committees  on  Justice  and  of
Finance for the many hours  of  work  they  have  put  in,  but  also,  more
importantly, the chairpersons of these committees, Barbara Hogan and  Johnny
de Lange, for the manner in which they  have  so  diligently  applied  their
minds and kept this task on track.

I have pleasure in placing before  this  House  the  Financial  Intelligence
Centre Bill.

Ms B A HOGAN: Madam Speaker, the Bill before us is a product, I believe,  of
how Parliament should operate. Two committees  met  to  deliberate  on  this
Bill, each bringing their  two  areas  of  expertise  to  bear  upon  it.  A
vigorous  debate  ensued,  and  we  believe  that  the  outcome   of   those
deliberations has contributed to an already very good Bill.

The Financial Intelligence  Centre  Bill  is  devoted  to  combating  money-
laundering. In the old days one used to believe that one could combat  crime
by prosecuting the crime itself, that is,  finding  the  crime,  identifying
the criminal and prosecuting the crime. We have learnt, much to our  regret,
that that is  insufficient  these  days.  Nowadays  we  have  a  battery  of
instruments at our disposal in order to deal with crime.
The forfeiture of the proceeds of crime is already present and is alive  and
well in South Africa. Finally, the money-laundering Bill that is now  before
us will help us to follow the money that is funding criminal activities  and
the money which criminals make out of pursuing their illegal activities.

I want one to think for a moment about the drug lord - I  have  never  heard
of the term ``drug lady'', I do not  believe  women  get  involved  in  such
activities ... [Laughter.] [Interjections.] ... I  will  not  engender  this
Bill, but let us talk about the drug lord.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: What about Mata Hari?

Ms B A HOGAN: It was a long time ago - we have improved since then.

The drug lord is in Hillbrow, the Cape Flats or Soweto is receiving  illicit
money for drugs received, and so he sits with a bagful of money. What is  he
going to do with it? If he puts it in the bank, sooner  or  later  the  SARS
will start asking questions about the origin of that money. He can spend  it
on a flashy car, but that is limited, and the more money he gets,  the  more
limitations there are. He can try and buy a house, which up to now has  been
possible.

But, finally, if one has to  think  about  it,  besides  the  purchasing  of
luxury goods, a criminal also wants to take that money and invest  and  grow
it, and use it for more investment in  criminal  activities.  What  is  that
criminal going to do? Firstly, that criminal will go about taking the  small
denomination bills that he gets and putting them through the first round  of
laundering that money, that is, making dirty money clean.

The criminal does this, for instance, by going into a casino,  buying  chips
and gambling just a little bit, and then  getting  the  casino  to  issue  a
cheque, which he or she takes and puts in  his  or  her  bank.  It  is  very
difficult to trace the origins of that money. That criminal  then  goes  and
probably buys a car wash, deposits money in excess of what he earns on  that
car wash, and gets some money through the system. That is  the  first  round
of money-laundering. But this is just a small-time criminal. Now we move  on
to the big-time criminal.

The big-time criminal now has that money in the banking system.  He  or  she
starts using a set of complex financial  transactions  to  move  this  money
around and - this is now getting sophisticated. For  instance,  let  us  say
``Operation Cassanova'' in the US found drug money laundered by  an  illegal
drug trafficker. He or she wired these funds to a bank  account  in  another
country outside the USA. Investigators then tried to get the  government  of
that country to assist them. When that government agreed to  help  them,  it
was found that that bank holding company was not even in that  country,  but
in another country. When they got to  that  country,  they  discovered  that
that bank did not have a building. They could not seize the assets  of  that
bank, because it was virtually a  fax  and  telephone.  So  the  money  gets
placed through a whole set of complex financial transactions which are  very
difficult to trace, and finally comes back as clean money.

With regard to a loan bank agreement,  the  criminal  takes  the  money  and
places it in an offshore account in an unregulated country. He or  she  then
takes a loan on that money and brings  it  back  into  the  country,  having
become perfectly legitimate money.

This is precisely what the Financial Intelligence Centre  Bill  is  intended
to address. The Financial Intelligence Centre Bill is  there  to  trace  the
movements of money that is  moving  through  the  layering  system  and  the
placement system in their complex range of financial transactions.  In  that
way, one would be able to discern criminal activity, one would  be  able  to
find the criminals in the system, and, very, very importantly, one would  be
able  to  curb   any   money-laundering   activity,   because   in   certain
circumstances the money being laundered, particularly  in  small  developing
countries, often exceeds the budget  of  the  particular  country  in  which
these  criminals  are  operating.  We  are  talking  about  countries   like
Colombia, for instance.

The integrity of the entire financial system of a country  is  fundamentally
undermined by money-laundering. Of course, we are  not  only  talking  about
drug dealing, but also  about  bribery,  counterfeiting,  drug  trafficking,
espionage, extortion, fraud, murder, kidnapping and terrorism  -  the  whole
gamut of racketeering activities that this Bill is designed to address.

Let us also not forget the political lords who  have  used  money-laundering
very effectively. Gen Sani Abacha of Nigeria is reckoned to  have  laundered
nearly R1,3 billion through UK banks, and Slobodan Milosevic, an  incredible
R2,9 billion through banks in Greece, Cyprus and  Switzerland.  Let  us  not
forget that money-laundering plays into very, very sinister motives.

The speakers that are going to follow me will speak comprehensively  on  the
provisions of this Bill. Let me just make a couple of comments though.
A centre is being set up to which  most  financial  institutions,  including
banks, estate agents and gambling boards, will  have  to  report  suspicious
transactions and  transactions  that  exceed  a  certain  cash  amount.  The
Financial Intelligence Centre will then analyse the  information  coming  to
it and make it available to an array of investigating forces, including  the
National  Intelligence  Services,  the  National   Directorate   of   Public
Prosecutions, the Police and the SA Revenue Service. These  different  units
will have to co-operate and decide who will  follow  which  trail,  and  who
will follow which case. That is going to need  a  lot  of  diplomacy  and  a
dedicated team of people who are not worried about  protecting  their  turf,
but who regard catching the criminal as very important.

Secondly, the institutions will have to report, and they  are  going  to  be
placed under enormous pressure to make sure  that  they  are  reporting  and
complying with the reporting requirements. The financial services  regulator
in the United Kingdom reported last year that he was really  concerned  that
the banks were still underreporting to a significant degree  in  the  United
Kingdom. The compliance requirements under  this  Act  are  very  stringent;
they are the De Lange requirements and they are very, very strict.

However, it is encouraging that the  industry  has  already  started  having
meetings. It has, in fact, anticipated government  policy  and  has  already
implemented  rules  and  regulations  related  to   money-laundering.   But,
certainly, the regulators  that  regulate  these  industries  -  the  Estate
Agents Board, the  Gambling  Board,  the  SA  Reserve  Bank,  the  Financial
Service Board, etc - are going to have to play a pivotal role  in  education
and in ensuring compliance. [Applause.]

Finally, I would like to thank  the  justice  portfolio  committee  and  its
members, particularly the chair, Mr Johnny de Lange, for the hard work  that
they put into  this  Bill.  It  has  been  the  most  rewarding  experience.
[Applause.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to follow on the  chairperson
of our committee, Ms Hogan, and I must say  that  I  certainly  bow  to  her
superior knowledge when it comes to knowing how  to  launder  money.  I  was
also making a short list of members who were  making  notes  while  she  was
speaking and I will provide that to the Minister in due course.

There is probably only one particular aspect about  this  Bill  that  really
does concern me, and I perhaps need to go back and read it again,  and  that
is that I agreed with everything that  the  Minister  said  in  his  speech,
which hon members can understand will certainly give me cause for concern.

Globalisation, together with the Internet, has provided  more  opportunities
for criminals to commit crimes,  using  electronic  communication,  commerce
and banking, and, in addition,  to  conceal  the  origins  of  the  monetary
proceeds of those crimes. Money-laundering, in essence,  is  the  converging
or transferring of the proceeds of  unlawful  activity  in  a  manner  which
conceals its origins. It is a major international problem which is  growing.
It is estimated to involve hundreds of billions and, possibly, trillions  of
US dollars each year and South Africa is no exception to this trend.

The Bill establishes a Financial Intelligence Centre which  will  assist  in
the identification of the proceeds of unlawful activities and the  combating
of money-laundering activities. The  centre  itself  will  not  enforce  the
laws, but it will gather information from the  private  and  public  sectors
and disseminate it to the appropriate law enforcement agencies.

The Bill places heavy responsibilities on various accountable  institutions,
such as banks, foreign exchange dealers and  stock  exchanges  by  requiring
them to know  their  clients  and  to  report  all  suspicious  and  unusual
transactions. As the Bill is complex, tens of  hours  were  spent  in  joint
finance and justice portfolio committee meetings,  and  a  large  number  of
amendments have been made to the Bill which was originally tabled.

This afternoon I would like to pay tribute to the two chairpersons, the  hon
members Barbara Hogan and Johnny de Lange,  for  the  thorough  and  orderly
manner in which they conducted the proceedings, and I think the  product  of
those proceedings is a tribute to the work of the committees as well as  the
leadership provided by the chairpersons.

I would also like to pay tribute to Mr  Mark  Phillips,  who  is  a  special
consultant to Mr Pieter Smit in the  office  of  the  National  Director  of
Public Prosecutions and to Mr Chris Malan from the  National  Treasury,  all
of whom played a very important role in assisting the committee  to  produce
a Bill that we were comfortable to recommend to the National Assembly.

We did face challenges. One was to provide for flexibility  to  be  able  to
cope with rapidly changing circumstances and technology and,  also  to  make
the Bill practical in respect of bodies as diverse  as  casinos,  banks  and
estate agencies.  To  do  this,  the  Bill  gives  the  Minister  powers  to
regulate, but with a requirement which differs,  depending  on  the  subject
matter of the particular regulation, in that  the  Minister  either  obtains
parliamentary approval in advance or, in some cases, simply formally  tables
the regulation in Parliament.

There is a danger contained in the Bill in that  it  provides  for  abnormal
invasions of privacy in respect of financial dealings.  However,  there  was
no way in which one could achieve the objectives  of  the  Bill,  yet  avoid
that invasion of privacy in respect of financial dealings.

The committee has tried to minimise any unfair adverse consequences of  this
invasion of privacy by ensuring that  there  are  stringent  confidentiality
provisions. Despite  the  onerous  responsibilities  placed  on  accountable
institutions, the Bill was supported by  the  financial  services  industry,
and no objections were received suggesting  that  the  costs  of  compliance
would be unreasonably high.

The DA hopes that this  Bill  will  help  to  counter  money-laundering  and
related criminal activity. We shall be supporting the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, the  Financial  Intelligence  Centre  Bill  is
probably the most scrutinised piece of  legislation  ever  debated  in  this
Chamber. The end result is a joint effort of  the  portfolio  committees  of
Justice and Finance.

Many joint meetings, over several  months,  have  taken  place,  and  I  can
assure members that this was a thorough process. The joint chairpersons  and
all the members should be congratulated for their dedication and  hard  work
in this regard.

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: That hon member  is  not
Mr Bakker from the New NP, but Mr Bekker from the IFP.

The SPEAKER: My apologies. I thought I had said Bekker.  [Interjections.]  I
am glad your Whip is calling you to order, Mr Bekker. [Laughter.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, I have since been called to order  by  my  own
Whip, and the monitor set is expanding and giving the  information.  Let  us
go rather on the Bekker formula than on the Bakker formula. [Laughter.]

This legislation focuses on money-laundering and the proceeds of  crime  and
drugs. The shifting of monies  used  to  purchase  weapons  and  to  finance
terrorism is also applicable. Members will agree that  after  that  terrible
Tuesday of 11 September nothing will be the same again.  Even  a  well-known
and  reputable  South  African  bank  has  been  identified  as   providing,
unwittingly, a  correspondence  agency  for  a  Saudi  bank  that  is  being
controlled by Osama Bin Laden.

South Africa, as an international player, must play  its  role  in  stemming
the tide of money-laundering. And in order to achieve  these  objectives,  a
Financial Intelligence Centre is to be established.  This  institution  will
fall outside the ambit of the Public Service, but  will  still  function  in
terms of public administration, as envisaged by the Constitution.

This centre will collect  information  on  suspected  proceeds  of  possible
unlawful activities, and in order  to  combat  money-laundering  activities,
this information, which will be  collected  by  the  centre,  will  then  be
passed on to the investigating authorities, the  intelligence  services  and
the SA Revenue Service to facilitate the enforcement  of  the  laws  of  the
Republic. A great deal of power or even excessive power is being granted  to
the centre in order for it to  trace  the  source  of  money  and  the  flow
thereof.

Let me now deal with money-laundering law enforcement and ways of  following
the money. In order to solve a crime, one must follow the  money.  A  three-
pronged approach to fighting crime is necessary:  prosecute  the  underlying
crime, follow the money trail through money-laundering  investigations,  and
then forfeiture of the proceeds  and  instruments  of  the  crime.  Only  by
following the money can the scope of a crime be discovered  and  a  criminal
organisation be destroyed.

Since 1986,  money-laundering  has  increasingly  become  a  global  problem
involving international financial transactions, the  smuggling  of  currency
across borders and the laundering in one country of the proceeds  of  crimes
committed in another country. Currency, monetary instruments and  electronic
funds flow  easily  across  international  borders,  allowing  criminals  in
foreign countries to hide their money in one state  and  enabling  criminals
in that country to conceal their ill-gotten gains in any one of hundreds  of
other countries around the world, with little concern that their  activities
will be detected by law enforcement agencies.

The basic problem  for  many  money-launderers,  and  especially  those  who
launder  the  proceeds  of  illegal  drug  activities,  remain   the   same:
concealing and moving  the  enormous  amounts  of  illicit  cash.  For  this
reason, even in the international context, the  United  States  government's
primary area of emphasis has been the placement stage  of  money-laundering,
the stage  at  which  the  money-launderer  first  seeks  to  enter  illicit
proceeds into the financial system.

South Africa has received assistance  and  training  from  the  US  in  this
regard, and we are highly regarded for our effort to stem the tide of money-
laundering. The chief of the international training of the FBI, Mr Judson  M
Ray, made the following remarks about South Africa:


  History has shown that when there is a major  change  in  a  governmental
  structure, crime becomes rampant. The Republic  of  South  Africa  is  no
  different.


  The crime problem in the RSA is serious and complex. In the wake  of  the
  change of government from the apartheid system and the years of sanctions
  preceding democratic elections, the RSA has had to cope  with  increasing
  crime. There is evidence that organised crime syndicates have established
  a formidable presence. Police officers are murdered at a rate higher than
  those in any other country in the world.

In conclusion, Mr Ray made the following observations:


  South Africa continues to suffer a severe crime problem.  Violent  crime,
  organised crime, narcotics  trafficking,  armed  assaults,  murders,  gun
  smuggling, vehicle theft, gang-related activity, money-laundering,  fraud
  and official corruption are just some of the interwoven  and  overlapping
  afflictions confronting South Africa. The criminal justice system is  not
  functioning well enough to combat the crime problem effectively.

To defeat international money-launderers it is imperative that  the  nations
of the world work together to exchange information and provide  co-operation
in investigations and asset forfeiture cases.

It is the policy of the US, pursuant to statutory authority,  to  share  the
proceeds of successful  forfeiture  actions  with  countries  that  made  it
possible or substantially facilitated the forfeiture of assets under  United
States law. This  process  of  sharing  these  proceeds  will  now  also  be
applicable in South Africa.

In July 2000 the US department of justice, with the concurrence  of  the  US
Secretary  of  State,  transferred  approximately  US$170  million   to   26
countries in recognition  of  their  forfeiture  assistance.  Asset  sharing
among countries enhances international forfeiture co-operation  by  creating
an incentive for countries to work together, regardless of where the  assets
are located or which jurisdiction will  ultimately  enforce  the  forfeiture
order. The most important issue is to take the criminal proceeds  away  from
the criminals.

A  complete  strategy  against  drug  trafficking  and  organised   criminal
activity must focus on the financial aspect of  the  criminal  activity.  In
order to accomplish this, there must be a comprehensive  set  of  laws  that
criminalise money-laundering, provide for asset seizure and  forfeiture  and
facilitate international co-operation.

In addition, a full range of  regulatory  measures,  such  as  comprehensive
bank supervision and a system  of  reporting  of  suspicious  activity,  are
necessary to deter and  detect  money.  Only  by  working  together  on  the
interagency and international levels will we be able to  stem  the  flow  of
criminal proceeds and criminal organisations in South Africa.

This Bill is long overdue, and on behalf of  the  IFP  I  have  pleasure  in
supporting the Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Madam Speaker and hon members,  the  Financial  Intelligence
Centre Bill deals with the combating of money-laundering activities.

In the publication The Economist there  was  an  illustrative  cartoon.  The
first picture showed a criminal with two bags of money at the counter  of  a
laundry. Then the money goes through a washing machine and  a  wringer,  and
then the bills go onto a washing line with dollars pegged,  all  hanging  on
the washing line. Eventually these dollars end up on an ironing board  which
is covered with a world map, which then shows how the money goes  back  into
circulation all clean and legal. This is exactly  what  money-laundering  is
about: the cleaning of dirty money.

This Bill complements the objective of our ANC-led Government, ie to  combat
crime and corruption, and it also complements the  Prevention  of  Organised
Crime Act. After the recent tragic event  that  took  place  in  the  United
States on 11 September, a number of governments are calling for a rapid  and
co-ordinated effort to detect and prevent the misuse of the world  financial
systems by terrorists. The European Union finance  and  economic  ministries
and the G7 finance ministers have  suggested  that  such  an  initiative  be
pursued in the framework of measures  already  taken  by  the  international
community to combat money-laundering.

The goal of a large number of criminal acts is to generate a profit for  the
individual or group that  carries  out  the  act.  Money-laundering  is  the
processing of the criminal proceeds to disguise their illegal  origin.  This
process is of critical importance as it enables the criminal to enjoy  these
profits without jeopardising their source.

When a criminal activity generates substantial profits,  the  individual  or
group involved must find a way  to  control  the  funds  without  attracting
attention to the underlying activity or the persons involved.  Criminals  do
this by disguising their sources, changing the form or moving the  funds  to
a place where they are less likely to attract attention.  The  International
Monitory Fund estimated the global volume of laundered money at 2% to 5%  of
global GDP annually. This is between US$600 billion and US$1,5 trillion.

The  effects  of  money-laundering   on   the   economy   has   far-reaching
consequences - it makes crime pay. It  allows  drug  traffickers,  smugglers
and other criminals to expand their operations. This drives up the  cost  of
law enforcement and health care, such as  the  cost  of  treatment  of  drug
addiction. It  has  the  potential  to  undermine  the  financial  community
because of the sheer magnitude of  the  sums  involved.  The  potential  for
corruption increases with the vast amounts of illegally  obtained  money  in
circulation.  Money-laundering  diminishes  Government   tax   revenue   and
therefore indirectly harms  honest  taxpayers  and  reduces  legitimate  job
opportunities.

This Bill will address - and we hope that  it  goes  far  enough  -  illegal
activities in money-laundering. The setting up of the centre as outlined  in
the  Bill  will  drive  the  process.  The  operation   of   oversight   and
accountability of the centre will be located outside the Public Service  but
within  the  public  administration  in  terms  of   section   19   of   the
Constitution, and will be accountable to the Minister of Finance.

The principal function of the centre is to  collect,  process,  analyse  and
interpret information of the proceeds arising  out  of  unlawful  activities
and the combating of money-laundering activities. The centre must also  make
information collected by it available to the investigation authorities,  the
intelligence  service  and  the  SA  Revenue  Service  to   facilitate   the
administration and the enforcement of the law of the Republic.

We must not underestimate the creativity of money-launderers. The  new  type
of money-laundering has what we call ``foot soldiers'' known  as  ``smurfs''
who carry cash around the country, making smaller deposits that do not  have
to be reported.  Certain  countries  avoid  setting  thresholds  and  merely
specify that suspect transactions  be  reported.  And  now  with  electronic
banking it makes the task more difficult to monitor.

Spotting those suspicious transactions in the immense flow of funds  is  not
easy, and computer software will have to be installed or updated  to  assist
this process. The Financial Intelligence  Centre  and  the  Money-Laundering
Advisory Council will rely on the accountable institutions  to  be  vigilant
and detect any suspicious transactions.

Failure by the accountable institutions  to  identify  persons  or  to  keep
records and destroying or tampering  with  records;  failure  to  co-operate
with the centre or to send reports to the  centre;  and  failure  to  report
suspicious or unusual transactions will be an offence and shall  be  treated
as a contravention of this Bill,  and  will  be  penalised  as  outlined  in
section 70 of the Bill.

Therefore, if hon Mr Goniwe - I see he is not in the House  now  -  goes  to
his bank and  deposits  R50  000,  he  should  immediately  be  detected  as
suspicious, because no  parliamentarian  makes  such  deposits.  [Laughter.]
Knowing one's client will assist  the  accountable  institutions  to  detect
fraudulent transactions.

The centre will be funded by money appropriated annually by Parliament.  Any
Government grants and any other  legally  acquired  funds  must  have  prior
approval by the Minister of Finance.

The ANC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Madam  Speaker,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  this  Bill
provides for the establishment of  a  Financial  Intelligence  Centre  which
will  illuminate  the  proceeds  of  unlawful   and   suspicious   financial
activities and for the combating of money-laundering activities,  which  has
regrettably escalated to levels of alarming concern.  One  of  the  aims  of
this Financial Intelligence Centre Bill will be to collect information  from
all respective role-players in the private and the public sectors,  as  well
as liaising with representative law-enforcement agencies.

This is a very technical and complex piece of legislation. The  justice  and
finance committees of Parliament spent  hours  on  this  Bill  and  a  large
number of amendments were made to see fit  our  particular  needs  in  South
Africa. A significant characteristic of this Bill is  that  any  institution
is accountable and must report suspicious deals within a  prescribed  period
of time. The grounds for suspicion must also be clearly stipulated.

The same principles also relate to the electronic transfers of money to  and
from South Africa.  The  South  African  financial  sector  is  becoming  an
integral component of the global  economic  order  which  requires  accepted
international business ethics. I  am  proud  to  say  that  this  particular
institution will definitely foster our  acceptance  into  the  international
global economic order.

The Financial Intelligence Centre Bill  stipulates  in  no  uncertain  terms
that it is the responsibility of  all  accountable  institutions  to  comply
with this Act. The list of accountable  institutions  vary  from  attorneys,
estate agents,  banks,  long-term  insurance  institutions,  legal  gambling
licensers, foreign exchange dealers, stock brokers and stock exchanges.

During the hours of deliberations regarding this  Bill  it  was  very  clear
that the respective sectors of the financial  community  thought  that  this
particular Bill was very much needed, and I am proud  to  say  that  the  DA
supports  this  Bill.  Money-laundering  has  become  a  very  sophisticated
activity. The severe penalties that are imposed by this Bill  are  welcomed.
I am referring to the  15  years'  imprisonment  or  R10  million  fine  for
offences committed by transgressors.

Further, I would like to say that some aspects of this Bill  can  be  viewed
as controversial as far as it relates to the invasion of  privacy  regarding
suspicious or questionable financial transactions. Clause 70  of  this  Bill
specifies the  procedure  to  be  followed  regarding  search,  seizure  and
forfeiture when there exist  reasonable  grounds  for  interference  by  the
Financial Intelligence Centre.

Something else which is very important about this Bill  is  that  clause  54
stipulates exactly when a particular offence has  been  committed  and  when
there is a possibility of a seizure and forfeiture of assets. I  would  like
to further point out that this Bill is very much in line with what has  been
stipulated in the Nel commission which did some research into  the  dealings
relating to the Masterbond saga.  What  is  alarming  is  that  our  current
legislation is rather inadequate, according to Judge Nel - and I agree  with
him  -  regarding  highly  sophisticated  white-collar  crime   and   money-
laundering  activities.  I  think  that  this  centre  and  this  piece   of
legislation will definitely fill the void that exists at present.

Something else which I think is very important about this Bill  is  that  it
transcends narrow political grounds,  and  I  think  all  responsible  South
Africans will welcome it.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Chairperson and hon members, the tragic events in  the  USA
on 11 September this  year  has  changed  the  world  for  ever.  The  deeds
committed on that day have focused the attention of the world on how  it  is
possible for terrorists and criminals to  manipulate  illegally  or  legally
acquired wealth and its  conversion  into  legitimate  funds.  We  in  South
Africa should therefore be eager  to  fully  enact  this  Bill  as  soon  as
possible.

The aim of this Bill is to prevent, combat and to monitor  money-laundering.
Money-laundering is defined as a  process  by  which  criminals  attempt  to
conceal the true origin and ownership of  the  proceeds  of  their  criminal
activities. Generally speaking,  money-laundering  involves  three  distinct
segments, and the Minister of Finance has referred to them.

These are, firstly, the placement  of  illegally  obtained  proceeds,  often
hard currency, into the financial system through banks  or  other  financial
institutions; secondly, layering in which the launderer  triggers  a  series
of complex secondary transactions  designed  to  separate  the  proceeds  of
criminal activities further from the original  source  of  the  funds;  and,
thirdly, in which integration, the laundered proceeds are  distributed  back
to the criminal for a number of purposes. Such laundered proceeds are  often
used to purchase luxury goods and to invest in legitimate enterprises.

It is, therefore, clear that  money-laundering  is  a  complex  and  a  very
serious problem, not only in our country, but  also  in  the  world.  It  is
estimated that the extent of money-laundering in  South  Africa  amounts  to
approximately $2 billion to $20 billion per year. To prevent and  to  combat
this crime effectively, we need hard-hitting and far-reaching legislation.

The Bill proposes a wide range of obligations on  accountable  institutions,
including attorneys, banks, estate  agents,  investment  brokers,  long-term
insurance brokers and  foreign  exchange  dealers.  Such  institutions,  for
example, have to establish  the  identity  of  their  clients,  keep  proper
records and report cash transactions and suspicious transactions.

The Bill provides, quite correctly, for a variety of possible offences.  The
penalties, in most instances, are very severe. What we  now  need  in  South
Africa is the following ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Carry on, hon member.

Dr G W  KOORNHOF:  Firstly,  we  need  full  enactment  and  the  electronic
reporting  of  this  Bill  as  soon  as  possible.  Secondly,  we  need  the
accountable institutions and companies to make  compliance  with  this  Bill
part of their business operations. Thirdly, we  need  greater  awareness  of
this problem amongst all role-players. Fourthly, we need the channelling  of
more resources to law-enforcement agencies. Fifthly, we need the closing  of
loopholes, and, lastly, a steep rise in convictions for money-laundering.

We believe that the establishment of the Financial Intelligence  Centre  and
the advisory council are the first important steps to make  South  Africa  a
creditworthy  role-player  in  the  world  in  the  fight   against   money-
laundering. This will be money  well  spent:  to  prevent  and  combat  this
crime. We are proud to  support  the  Financial  Intelligence  Centre  Bill.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Mr Chairperson, hon members,  the  Financial
Intelligence Centre Bill, tabled before the  House  today,  establishes  the
Financial Intelligence Centre and the Money Laundering Advisory Council  and
creates new legal  categories  of  accountable  institutions  and  reporting
institutions. The  Bill  places  a  number  of  obligations  on  accountable
institutions based on the ``know your  customer''  principle  and  reporting
procedures.

The Minister has provided the House with a broad context  within  which  the
Bill is being introduced. I shall touch briefly on some of  the  details  of
the Bill and how the National Treasury envisages the implementation  of  the
Bill. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! hon members!

The DEPUTY MINISTER:  The  Financial  Intelligence  Centre  will  act  as  a
central  repository  of  information  on  money-laundering  activities.  The
Financial  Intelligence  Centre   is   being   established   for   financial
intelligence  gathering  and  analysis.  It  will   receive   reports   from
accountable institutions, process, analyse and  interpret  the  data  before
passing this information over to the  law  enforcement  agencies  which,  in
turn, will use the information for further  investigation  and,  ultimately,
prosecution. It must be emphasised that the  FIC  is  not  an  investigative
body. The function of investigating suspected criminal activity will  remain
with those  authorities  that  are  tasked  with  this  function  under  the
Constitution.

Therefore high on  the  FIC's  agenda  will  be  the  development  of  close
relationships with the different law  enforcement  agencies.  The  FIC  will
work closely with the SA Police Service and its specialised units to  assist
it in investigating allegations of money-laundering. It  will  work  closely
with the National Prosecuting Authority and the  Scorpions,  in  which  case
the assets identified as  being  the  results  of  laundering  and  unlawful
activities will be under threat of seizure.

It will work closely with the SA Revenue  Service  to  help  stamp  out  tax
evasion.  It  will  also  work  closely   with   the   supervisory   bodies,
particularly the SA Reserve Bank and the  Financial  Services  Board,  which
jointly have a responsibility to ensure compliance by banks,  mutual  banks,
other  deposit-taking   institutions   and   licensed   financial   services
companies, as accountable institutions.

More importantly - and here we have gained from international  experience  -
the FIC will also create a feedback loop so that there can be a  process  of
regularly informing accountable institutions on  laundering  activities  and
trends, as  well  as  successful  investigations  and  prosecutions.  It  is
important to the principle of  a  public  -  private  partnership  combating
money-laundering activities, as entrenched in the Bill - which I  will  deal
with  later  -  that  there  is  as  much  dialogue  as  possible   on   the
effectiveness and efficiency of the compliance measures  imposed  under  the
Bill.

The FIC will be headed by an appropriately qualified director. A  relatively
small staff complement is intended, which will be made  up  of  a  full-time
corps  with  others  drawn  by  way  of  secondment  from  other  Government
departments, such  as  the  SA  Police  Service,  the  National  Prosecuting
Authority and the SA Revenue Service. Others will  be  recruited  for  their
specialised skills, their proven ability for analysing financial  data,  and
forensic work, or their legal and investigative skills. This will promote  a
co-operative endeavour to combat money-laundering  which  is  in  line  with
best practice elsewhere in the world.

Central to the proper functioning of the FIC  will  be  the  IT  systems  it
utilises. These will need to enable  the  centre  to  receive  reports  from
accountable  institutions  and  for  it  to  develop  databases  of   stored
information. Over time, large  volumes  of  data  will  need  to  be  sifted
through  and  analysed  for  names,  links  and  networking  patterns.  This
information will then be fed through to the investigating agencies for  them
to carry out further investigation and prosecute offenders.

These IT systems will require careful scoping in the months ahead.  The  FIC
will want to avoid reinventing the wheel by refraining from spending  hugely
on development costs when proven software has  already  been  developed  for
this kind of work. Therefore the National Treasury is already in  discussion
in this regard with other financial intelligence units.

The battle against organised crime and money-laundering  cannot  be  won  by
Government and public bodies alone. To  be  effective,  antimoney-laundering
policy requires a partnership between the Government,  the  private  sector,
and supervisory  and  regulatory  bodies  which  operate  in  the  financial
sector.

This partnership is given practical  expression  in  the  Bill  through  the
establishment of a  Money-Laundering  Advisory  Council.  The  council  will
facilitate public-private co-operation, and will advise on  the  development
of appropriate antimoney-laundering policies. Although the council will  not
have any executive or regulatory  powers,  it  will  be  necessary  for  the
Minister to consult with it before  issuing  regulations  or  exempting  any
accountable institutions from the provisions of the Act.

The Financial Intelligence Centre Bill places a number of obligations  on  a
list of accountable institutions.  Accountable  institutions  and  reporting
institutions are those companies and businesses  which  we  consider  to  be
most susceptible to money-laundering activities. These include  banks,  life
assurance companies, foreign  exchange  dealers,  casinos  and  even  estate
agents.  These  institutions  will  be  required   to   implement   internal
administrative systems to ensure that  they  know  their  customers,  report
suspicious and certain cash transactions, keep records  of  their  customers
and  the  transactions  that  they  were  involved  in,  appoint  compliance
officers and train employees to comply with the provisions of the Bill.  The
``know-your-client''  principle,  which  is  reflected  in  these  sections,
together with the record-keeping and reporting requirements of the Bill,  is
central to any anti-money-laundering regimes worldwide.

We are aware that the  accountable  institutions  run  their  operations  in
sectors which  are  different  from  one  another.  Some  sectors  are  more
susceptible to money-laundering than others. Some  will  find  some  of  the
provisions of the Bill more costly to  comply  with  than  others.  In  some
cases, it will be appropriate to exempt some accountable  institutions  from
some of the obligations contained in the Bill. For  this  reason,  the  Bill
permits the maximum possible flexibility in its application  to  accountable
institutions. I envisage that  through  a  process  of  exemptions  and  the
drafting of regulations relevant to each sector governed by  the  provisions
of the Act, an  appropriate,  comprehensive  and  cost-efficient  antimoney-
laundering regime will be put in place.

The National Treasury has already  assembled  a  regulations-drafting  team,
duly assisted by a drafter from the Asset Forfeiture  Unit,  which  has  the
brief of providing the finer details of the Bill. Treasury is  committed  to
continuing  ongoing  consultation  with   representatives   of   accountable
institutions and supervisory  and  regulatory  bodies  to  ensure  that  the
exemptions  and  regulations  which  will  be  promulgated  in  future   are
appropriate to their respective industries.

We also intend drafting the regulations in the sequence that we  expect  the
legislation  to  be  enacted.  Therefore  those  regulations  dealing   with
customer identification and record-keeping  requirements  will  be  prepared
first, followed by the requirements  for  reporting  information.  The  Bill
makes it possible  for  these  regulations  to  be  implemented  only  after
consultation with the Centre  and  the  Money-Laundering  Advisory  Council.
Therefore these two bodies will be established as soon as possible.

The  Bill  also  creates  a  category  of  reporting   institutions.   These
institutions, which at this stage only comprise dealers  in  motor  vehicles
and Kruger rands, will be required to report  suspicious  and  certain  cash
transactions, but they will not be required to comply with all of the  other
obligations imposed on accountable institutions.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  Deputy  Minister,  I  am
afraid your speaking time has expired.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: I am confident that the  Bill  achieves  all  of  these
things without making unnecessary or inappropriate demands on the  country's
resources. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon Ms L  A  Mabe  will  be
making her maiden speech. [Applause.]

Ms L MABE: Mr Chairperson,  as  a  South  African  woman,  I  am  proud  and
grateful to stand here today as an ANC member of Parliament. I  pledge  that
I will not forget where South Africa comes from and the tortuous journey  we
travelled to achieve freedom and democracy.

Those who have not travelled this journey  cannot  comprehend  the  need  to
defend and deepen our democracy, and to jealously guard  against  all  types
of counter revolutionary actions. And we must  also  acknowledge  our  past,
change the present and build the future.

Today I am reminded of my late father,  whose  life  was  taken  near  Jeppe
Hostel in Johannesburg in the early 1990s, at the time  when  the  apartheid
system  fought  fiercely  to  distract  the  attention  of  the   liberation
movements away from the light of freedom that was shining  on  the  horizon.
He believed that, regardless of  my  age  and  gender,  I  had  a  right  to
freedom; that is  freedom  of  conscience,  religion,  thought,  belief  and
opinion. I miss those debates around the Sophiatown  activities  and  events
in the context of the current political situation.

Our martyrs, such as O R Tambo, Lillian Ngoyi, Chris Hani, Sol  Plaatje  and
others, stand out like a crowd of witnesses urging us all to  march  forward
with greater speed and purpose in South Africa. Our  democracy  has  ushered
South Africa  into  the  global  economic  market.  It  has  exposed  it  to
international organised crime which always flourishes in new democracies.

Since coming to power in 1994, the ANC-led Government has  targeted  violent
crime as a priority to ensure  that  our  courts  have  the  power  to  deal
ruthlessly with the complex patterns of criminal  behaviour.  This  Bill  is
part of that process.

Money-laundering is an international  problem,  which  is  not  confined  to
South Africa alone. There is a complex behaviour of criminal  activities  in
relation  to  money-laundering.  And  this  Bill  is   a   result   of   the
collaboration  between  the  Ministries  of  Finance  and  Justice  and  key
Government departments. It  has  been  looked  at  with  interest  by  other
governments all over the world.

Under the apartheid government the legal  system  did  not  keep  pace  with
international developments in combating crime. The  Government  focused  its
attention on criminalising the actions of those who were  committed  to  the
struggle for democratic rights. Today  we  as  the  ANC-led  Government  are
faced with the challenge of addressing this short-sightedness.

The purpose of establishing the Financial Intelligence Centre is to  provide
information and intelligence  that  will  enable  the  Government  to  fight
against  money-laundering.  That  information  will  help  those   who   are
dedicated to the eradication of  organised  crime  in  order  to  smoke  out
international syndicates which are  using  this  country  to  launder  money
under the pretext of not doing anything which is against the law.

We are seeking to make remarkable progress in dealing with  the  scourge  of
criminality. We have seen  the  success  of  our  special  units  which  are
dedicated to  fighting  crime,  hijacking,  urban  terror  and  gang-related
violence. Our  Government  realises  that  we  cannot  fight  these  massive
problems of crime using unco-ordinated and ad hoc measures. There are  those
prophets of doom who say that we must bring back the death penalty, and  all
will be well. What an unfortunate situation! Their cries are hollow, for  in
their hearts they know very well that this is not a solution to the  problem
crime that is ravaging the whole  world.  A  hang-them-high  approach  might
make good politics, but it makes bad governance. Our challenge is  to  fight
crime on all fronts by establishing a sound legislative framework to  enable
us to catch criminals, to secure convictions  and  to  impose  appropriately
heavy sentences which support a well-trained and reserved  criminal  justice
system.

The fight against crime is not simply the job of the police and the  courts.
It is the job of all sectors of society, and this Bill is an  example.  This
Bill creates the framework and  facilitates  for  co-operation  between  the
financial sector and Government for the sharing  of  information  that  will
allow us to nail those criminals and  hang  them,  without  using  the  rape
which was used in the past.

It will compel business to go into deals with their eyes  open  and  to  ask
questions if people come with bags of cash wanting to make  investment,  for
example, by purchasing a piece of property. It  will  allow  a  channel  for
people who are suspicious of their clients' identities or sources  of  their
funding to voice  their  suspicions  with  confidentiality,  confident  that
their contents will be addressed appropriately.

This is a good piece of legislation, especially because it is  new  in  this
country. It is the result of  extensive  refinement  and  consultation.  The
Bill itself is straightforward and easy to understand, even to the  ordinary
person in the street. And I must compliment the drafters of  this  Bill  for
its accessibility to the public.

I consider it a great honour, as a new  member  of  this  House  and  a  new
member  of  the  Portfolio   Committee   on   Justice   and   Constitutional
Development, to have been afforded this opportunity to  participate  in  the
debate about  this  ground-breaking  piece  of  legislation  which  will  be
another powerful weapon in our arsenal which  we  use  to  fight  crime.  By
supporting this Bill  we  are  taking  the  fight  to  the  criminals,  drug
dealers, gangsters - wherever they are syndicates, hijackers, bank  robbers.
Their time has expired. They will be forced to oblige, whether they like  it
or not. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, in  the  visitors,
gallery we have the honourable Mr Li Qiyan who is the  deputy  minister  for
labour and social security in China. He is  visiting  with  his  delegation.
[Applause.] The delegation is here in order to further strengthen trade  and
other relations between South Africa and China. On behalf of the  Parliament
of the Republic of South Africa, we welcome the delegation to  South  Africa
and to our Parliament. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister, may I also bring an  element  of
justice  from  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice   and   Constitutional
Development to this debate.

It is undeniable that South Africa  has  fallen  behind  international  best
practices in its attempts to combat money-laundering. Whilst  the  need  for
this encompassing legislation has existed for some time, the  events  of  11
September in America have emphasised the urgent need  for  the  legislation,
notwithstanding its invasion of privacy.

This Bill should send a clear signal to those who would abuse the  worldwide
instruments  of  trade   to   aid   their   nefarious   schemes,   including
international terrorism and drug trafficking, that South  Africa  is  firmly
on the side of those who uphold law and order  to  ensure  a  safe  flow  of
international goods and services, and the safe passage of individuals.

The  heart  of  the  Bill  lies  in  the  reporting  duties  and  access  to
information set out in Part 3, particularly clauses 28  and  29.  Clause  29
included and took over the provisions and functions  of  section  7  of  the
Prevention of Organised Crime Act, and has been  amended  to  make  specific
reference to unusual transactions and tax evasion.

A new proposed 40(1) (b), which better regulates the procedures for  sharing
information with other investigating authorities outside  South  Africa,  is
to be welcomed, particularly in view of the terrorist attacks on the  United
States of America.

Whilst the ACDP appreciates that section 41  of  the  Constitution  requires
intergovernmental  co-operation  and  the  fact  that  a  similar  committee
established in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act never met,  we
do believe that a money-laundering co-ordinating committee, as  proposed  in
previous drafts of the Act, would have served a useful purpose  in,  as  its
name implies, co-ordinating the implementation of policies and  measures  by
the centre and other relevant Government institutions.

The  ACDP  will,  however,  support  this  Bill,  notwithstanding  that  one
reservation, because, as the previous speaker pointed out, it is  a  further
weapon in the arsenal to fight crime. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Mr Chairperson, Government has the  responsibility  to  see
to it that the quality  of  life  of  people  is  enhanced.  It  is  equally
incumbent upon Government to be sure that people obtain wealth in an  honest
manner. And this Bill seeks to address just that.  Wealth  is  a  result  of
hard work, and we believe that everyone has to live by the  sweat  of  one's
brow.

The passing of this Bill will assist  in  putting  in  place  an  instrument
which will assist in nailing those  who  acquire  a  lot  of  money  through
underhand methods. The fact that the centre will work in collaboration  with
the SA Revenue Service, the intelligence  Service  and  other  investigating
authorities, will help  in  tightening  the  noose  around  the  launderers'
necks.

The use of the Internet has paved the way for laundering money in more  ways
than one. Attention should, however, also  be  given  to  some  banks  whose
employees amass money from the savings of poor  and  illiterate  clients  of
the banks by stealthily operating their accounts on the ATM.

We only hope that the representatives of the institutions that  compose  the
advisory council will themselves be  honest,  honourable  and  hard-working.
They should not use the advisory council  to  further  their  own  nefarious
ways and acts. We hope they will be persons of  integrity  who  will  resist
the temptation  of  confiscating  goods  and  cash  from  people  and  never
reporting  it,  or  themselves  turning  into  modern-day   Ananiases.   The
prevalent white-collar crime in Government circles should be nipped  in  the
bud.

We hope that the establishment of the  Financial  Intelligence  Centre  will
assist in bringing to book individuals and institutions  that  prey  on  the
poor people in this country  by  introducing  them  to  foreign  faiths  and
beliefs and offering them money,  as  has  been  the  case  with  Osama  bin
Laden's family.

The UCDP supports the Bill.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairman and hon members, the main purpose of this  Bill  is
to establish the Financial Intelligence Centre  and  the  Money-  Laundering
Advisory Council in order to combat money-laundering activities.  The  Bill,
when it becomes law, will impose certain duties on institutions and  persons
who might be used for money-laundering purposes.

The Financial Intelligence Centre is established as an  institution  outside
the Public Service, but within the public administration. This  is  provided
for in section 125 of  the  Constitution.  This  section  deals  with  basic
values and principles governing public administration.

Clause 3 states, and I quote:


  The principal purpose of the centre is to assist in the identification of
  the proceeds of unlawful activities and the combating of money-laundering
  activities.

Clause  21  deals  with  money-laundering  control  measures.  Clause  17(1)
authorises search, seizure and forfeiture.

The PAC supports this Bill. It is an imperative piece of legislation in  our
fast-changing world, in which a  lot  of  technology  is  in  the  hands  of
criminals. This makes them very sophisticated  criminals,  and  it  requires
sophisticated legislation to deal with it.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, may I congratulate  the  hon  Mabe  on  her
maiden speech. Well done!

Organised crime is present in South Africa, as it is  globally,  and  it  is
certainly a problem that needs immediate attention. One of  its  many  noted
forms is money-laundering. It  was  reported  in  the  Business  News  by  a
corporate governance specialist  in  August  this  year  that  South  Africa
attracts R49,2 billion and exports R32,8 billion  of  laundered  money  each
year. These estimates are not only shocking, but also intolerable.

The Government has already taken a stand in recognising money-laundering  as
a crime in section 4 of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act of 1998.  With
that in place, the next urgent step is to introduce a  mechanism  to  combat
this criminal offence. This Bill clearly provides for such  a  mechanism  by
the introduction of institutions which  will  inculcate  it  and  provide  a
clear procedure that should be followed by a network which  will  contribute
to ensuring that money-laundering fails.

The party notes  the  specifics  provided  for  by  the  Bill  as  to  which
institutions and individuals are regulated by  the  Bill,  as  well  as  the
control measures intended to  be  incorporated.  The  MF  congratulates  the
department on its efforts to combat organised crime. It is evident that  the
department has not only defined this problem, but also outlined  a  plan  of
action to eradicate the problem.

The MF supports bringing to an end all organised crime,  ie  nationally  and
internationally, and places its confidence in this Bill  as  taking  a  step
closer to attaining such a goal. The MF supports the Financial  Intelligence
Centre Bill. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, I want to ask the following  question:  What  went
wrong? This is the fifth Bill we are debating this week,  and  the  AEB  has
supported every one of them! [Laughter.]

There is an important underlying principle in a Bill like this:  it  is  the
delicate balance between the  freedom  of  the  individual,  the  collective
responsibility of civil society and the delegated authority  of  the  state.
In  an  ideal  world,  the  freedom  of  the  individual,  tempered  by  the
collective responsibility of civil society, would be sufficient.  But  in  a
broken society, illustrated again by the events of 11 September in  America,
the important role of the state comes into operation as well,  and  we  must
acknowledge that.

The prerequisite must  be  that  the  state  performs  this  function  in  a
responsible manner in co-operation with civil society,  without  unnecessary
infringements on the freedom of the individual. It is my opinion  that  this
Bill succeeds in maintaining this balance.

The plus point of this Bill is the  co-opting  of  civil  society  into  the
cause of freeing South Africa from money-laundering  activities  and  crime,
not only through reaction, but also through proactive conduct. In  addition,
the fact  that  both  the  Financial  Intelligence  Centre  and  the  Money-
Laundering Advisory Council will  be  institutions  which  are  outside  the
Public Service, which makes them  organs  of  civil  society,  is  an  added
advantage.

Dit is duidelik dat die portefeuljekomitee goeie werk  gedoen  het  met  die
finale weergawe. Die aanvanklike produk is aansienlik  verbeter,  soos  blyk
uit die volgende: in die feit dat die werknemers van  die  sentrum,  wat  'n
noodsaaklike diens lewer, nie mag staak nie; die  verbeterde  bepalings  ten
opsigte van sekerheidsklaring; die feit dat die Minister  nie  in  die  raad
dien nie; die  aanverwante  wette;  en  die  inbou  van  'n  verweer  by  'n
vermeende oortreding.

Natuurlik kan die wet misbruik  word  en  die  sentrum  in  'n  Big  Brother
ontaard.  Dit  plaas  groter  verantwoordelikheid  op  die  betrokkenes   om
privaatheid te respekteer. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It is clear that the portfolio committee has  done  a  good  job  with  the
final version. The initial product has been significantly improved upon,  as
is evident from the following: the fact that the employees  at  the  centre,
who render an  essential  service,  may  not  go  on  strike;  the  improved
provisions regarding security clearance; the fact  that  the  Minister  does
not serve on the council; related legislation; and the  incorporation  of  a
defence in case of an alleged transgression.

Of course, this legislation is open to abuse and the centre  may  degenerate
into a Big Brother. This places greater responsibility  on  those  concerned
to respect privacy.]

The AEB is convinced that this legislation has  become  essential  and  that
every honest citizen will co-operate with  it.  Money  honestly  earned  and
worked for can always stand the scrutiny of daylight. The AEB  supports  the
Financial Intelligence Centre Bill.

Mr G SOLOMON: Chairperson ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I am  not  quite  sure  of  the
reason for the sudden exuberance, but in any case, let us  hear  the  speech
first. [Interjections.]

Mr SOLOMON:  Chairperson,  money-laundering  is  an  essential  activity  of
organised criminal gangs and, according to the hon  Barbara  Hogan,  perhaps
even some heads of state. Successful money-laundering is an  invisible  hand
that ensures that organised crime pays. It is also a  resource  for  funding
the perpetration of  some  of  the  most  serious  crimes  in  our  country.
Therefore an effective antimoney-laundering regime will have  an  enormously
positive impact on the prevention of  serious  criminal  activity  in  South
Africa perpetrated by organised criminal gangs.

South Africa has one of the broadest ranges of money-laundering offences  in
its Statute Book, in fact in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the  Prevention  of  the
Organised Crime Act of 1998. These are  money-laundering  itself,  assisting
another  to  benefit  from  the  proceeds  of   unlawful   activities,   the
acquisition, possession or use of the proceeds of unlawful  activities,  and
the  failure  to  report  suspicion  regarding  the  proceeds  of   unlawful
activities. All of these can give rise to a charge  on  one  of  the  money-
laundering offences.

South Africa also has a structure  for  the  recovery  of  the  proceeds  of
profit-generating criminal activity that is more advanced than many  in  the
world. It comprises  convictions-based  confiscation  and  civil  forfeiture
procedures without requiring a conviction. But the legal picture,  according
to Adv Pieter Smit of the office of the National Directorate of  the  Public
Prosecutions, is incomplete without effective administrative measures  which
will identify  money-laundering  in  order  to  facilitate  its  prevention,
detection, investigation and prosecution.

This is the rationale behind the Bill under discussion here today. It  makes
provision for the establishment of a Financial  Intelligence  Centre  and  a
Money-laundering  Advisory  Council  which  can  serve  as  a  conduit   for
receiving crucial information from accountable  institutions  which  can  be
exploited for money-laundering purposes.  This  information  would  then  be
communicated to the relevant law-enforcement authorities for investigation.

The fight against organised crime in South Africa can  be  ascribed  to  the
new democratic Government alone. The concept of organised  crime  was  never
part of the crime discourse  of  the  safety  and  security  regime  of  the
apartheid government. I am not aware that the term was ever used  in  police
and security reports or communiques before 1990.

The focus of the police and the security forces of the apartheid  government
was on organised resistance to apartheid,  and  the  best  of  its  criminal
investigators were employed to crack organised  resistance  to  the  regime,
not organised crime. This provided an  opportunity  for  criminal  gangs  to
consolidate. Organised Crime, in fact, came of age in  the  1980s  in  South
Africa. According to  the  Institute  for  Security  Studies  and  Research,
former members of the apartheid security forces  are,  indeed,  involved  in
this type of activity.

This led to the view that organised crime might be a deliberate  project  of
those opposed to democracy, that is,  a  conspiracy  to  undermine  the  new
democratic state in South Africa. The report of the Institute  for  Security
Studies and Research indicates that organised crime has  grown  dramatically
since the transition to  democracy  began  in  1990  and  has  caught  South
African  law  enforcement  agencies   unprepared.   Just   like   legitimate
multinational businesses, East Asian,  Nigerian  and  East  European  groups
bought into local South African criminal operations  and  expanded  them  or
contracted subsidiary organisations to conduct their work for them.

The institute points out that four factors  should  be  taken  into  account
when measuring the extent to which organised crime has  developed  in  South
Africa since the transition to democracy. These are, firstly, the degree  to
which various  organised  crime  groups  have  consolidated  either  through
mergers or structured co-operations in the country; secondly, the role  that
former members  of  the  apartheid  security  forces  play  in  relation  to
organised crime.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! [Interjections.]

Mr G SOLOMON: What is the order for, Chairperson?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I am trying to get  the  House  to  be
more receptive to what you are saying.

Mr M J ELLIS: You were not making a very good speech.

Mr G SOLOMON: The third one  is  the  degree  to  which  organised  criminal
groups  have  been  successful  in  penetrating  the  state  in   corrupting
officials, and the fourth one is  the  degree  to  which  foreign  organised
crime groups operate within the country and have  forged  links  with  local
crime syndicates.

What is the extent of the problem in South Africa? Organised criminal  gangs
are  extremely   sophisticated   and   deceptive.   Their   money-laundering
activities are secretive and misleading by nature because they use the  same
institutions and technology as legitimate businesses. Information  published
in 1997 by the Crime Information Analysis Centre of the SAPS indicated  that
192 organised criminal groups were known to be active  in  South  Africa  at
the time, with another 500 so-called  target  groups,  the  full  extent  of
their activities still being unknown.

The crimes in which these active groups are involved  include  drugs,  motor
vehicle theft, particularly of the more expensive kind,  diamonds  and  gold
and of  firearms,  and  the  smuggling  of  abalone,  and  related  criminal
activity such as prostitution, murder, blackmail, corruption,  hijacking  of
freight  vehicles,  armed  robbery,  gang  violence,   taxi   violence   and
housebreaking.

Why should money-laundering be combated with intensity in South Africa?  The
proceeds of crime are the lifeblood of organised criminal groups.  In  order
for them to sustain and continue with their criminal activity, they have  to
legitimise this income  through  the  process  of  laundering.  Once  firmly
established, organised crime operations are  very  difficult  to  eradicate.
The process of laundering must be disrupted before this sets  in.  Organised
criminal groups weaken the social fabric ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order hon Mr Bloem!

Mr G SOLOMON: Organised criminal groups weaken the social fabric,  influence
collective ethical standards and undermine democratic institutions.

Leaving economic power in the hands  of  organised  criminals  will  enhance
their  capacity  to  corrupt  Government  and   law-enforcement   officials.
Institutions that become involved in money-laundering also face  the  danger
of  corrupt  employees,  fraud  and  the  loss   of   control   over   their
institutions. One of the items on the shopping list of  money-launderers  is
an efficient financial system, which  we  have.  But  if  control  over  the
financial system is weak this  will  make  it  more  attractive  for  money-
launderers.

If we are to succeed in the fight against the  danger  of  money-laundering,
we firstly have to equip the centre with the resources to perform  the  task
expected of it, which means that it has to be  properly  budgeted  for.  Co-
operation of private sector partners is vital. Careful co-ordination of  the
activities of the different groupings amongst law  enforcement  agencies  is
also very essential, and we must avoid conflict amongst them.

The ANC supports this  Bill,  particularly  the  Johnny  de  Lange  clauses.
[Applause.]

Mr K A MOLOTO: Chairperson,  hon  members,  the  tabling  of  the  Financial
Intelligence Centre Bill comes at a critical moment as our economy forms  an
integral part of the globalised economy.

One of the key features of globalisation is the free flow of capital  across
borders. This is made possible by advances in  information  technology.  Let
us acknowledge that  crime  has  become  international  in  scope,  and  the
financial dimensions of crime are getting increasingly complex due  to  this
rapid flow of capital across borders. Therefore it is important  that  banks
should know the true identity of their clients very well. One cannot  simply
have men wearing expensive designer suits carrying  suitcases  stacked  with
cash coming into banks and banking the money with ease.

Money-laundering has the potential to undermine our financial system  if  it
is not dealt a vicious blow. It is common knowledge that poorly  capitalised
banks established by organised syndicates can weaken the banking system  ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  no  business
transactions in the aisles, please.

Mr K A MOLOTO: Chairperson, it is common knowledge that  poorly  capitalised
banks established by organised syndicates can  weaken  the  banking  system,
thus causing a major domestic financial crisis.  A  corrupt  banking  system
increases the danger of a domestic liquidity crisis. Such developments  have
the potential of undermining the confidence investors have  in  a  country's
financial system, thus encouraging  capital  flight  and  dwindling  of  the
country's investment reserves. South Africa cannot afford this. We  need  to
deal a decisive blow to money-laundering.

The monitoring of the registration of banks is quite vital in maintaining  a
credible people's banking system. Banks provide the  necessary  intermediary
service in order to secure funds for productive investments. Let us look  at
this embarrassing occurrence. It relates to the  establishment  of  BCCI,  a
deposit-taking bank established by Aga Hasan Abedi. He registered  the  bank
in the Cayman Islands, which are situated to  the  north  west  of  Jamaica.
George  Town,  the  capital  on  Grand  Cayman,  boasted  550  banks.   This
translated into one bank for every 15 residents. The  banks  had  collective
assets in excess of R400 billion. What is more puzzling is  that  less  than
15% of these banks registered in the Cayman  Islands  received  cash.  There
were no tellers and no vaults to keep money. Most of  the  banks  were  only
centres for dealing with the paperwork relating to money deposited in  other
countries and for  electronically  facilitating  money-laundering  in  other
jurisdictions.

Mr Abedi moved his top management to London after registering  the  bank  in
the Cayman Islands. The Bank of England gave BCCI credibility by  confirming
every year for fifteen years that its finances were in order. It later  left
the Bank of England with egg on its face. BCCI was to turn into a big money-
laundering scheme. Private  jets  belonging  to  banks  would  fly  cash  to
branches in Panama or the Cayman Islands and deposit it there,  which  would
be wired later to Luxembourg, where the  paper  trail  of  the  dirty  money
would disappear.

The FIC obliges banks to keep  all  records  of  their  transactions  for  a
stipulated period. This is indicative of the need  to  maintain  control  of
the registration of banks. This Parliament has  done  this  through  various
pieces of legislation. Money-laundering directs money from sound  investment
to risky low-quality investment and impacts negatively on  economic  growth.
Typically money-launderers will invest in property  and  quickly  sell  that
property,  thus  triggering  a  massive  oversupply  of  property  in   that
location. This unnecessary oversupply depresses property values.

Money-laundering distorts data on actual national  expenditure  and  income.
Therefore it complicates the efforts of government to  manage  its  economic
policy and design appropriate measures in  order  to  intervene  in  certain
sectors of the economy. On the national figures there would be  an  increase
in  the  amount  of  taxable  income.  However,  that  income  would  simply
disappear. It  undermines  the  tax  base  and  has  major  consequences  on
government's projections of income.

Money-laundering undermines the monetary system of  any  country.  It  takes
money out of financial systems and distorts the value of the exchange  rate.
The demand and supply of one's currency will  not  reflect  a  true  picture
because of these sudden unexpected inflows and outflows.

Let me conclude by relating a very interesting  story.  A  Colombian  cartel
boss, Pablo Escobar, had to write off  R40  million  in  cash,  money  which
rotted in a California basement. He could not launder the money  as  quickly
as he wished.

Let us make it difficult for drug traffickers to wash their dirty  money  as
they wish. Banks have to join Government to fight this menace. [Applause]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, hon members, let  me  express  sincere
appreciation to all of the speakers from all the parties for  their  support
for the Financial Intelligence Centre Bill.

I know that the Bill was debated extensively  over  a  long  period  in  the
joint committees, and I know that some members may be tired by  now  because
the debate has been very long. [Interjections.] But I would like to  say  to
the hon Ellis that we must  not  take  this  legislation  for  granted.  The
issues that  the  hon  Moloto  has  just  shared  with  us  are  exceedingly
important. It needs to be in our collective psyche that we must  take  joint
responsibility for the prevention of these  kinds  of  crimes.  The  support
that all parties have given here must surely  be  translated  into  what  we
expect from institutions out there - their voluntary participation.

One can go to the Antlantic Seaboard here and ask how  many  of  those  very
expensive apartments had been bought with hard cash, with the estate  agents
present and overseeing these transactions. One can  go  and  look  at  other
kinds of assets that have  been  acquired  in  this  way.  There  have  been
stories about drug lords being  able  to  deposit  millions  of  rands  into
otherwise normal high-street institutions.

We have to change this. We have to change the mind of South  Africa  and  we
have a collective responsibility to do that. My plea this afternoon is  that
this very wide-ranging support for this Bill should be taken  out  there  so
that it can be taken up by all South Africans, in order to ensure  that  our
children have a place. If drug lords cannot deposit dirty money,  they  will
not sell the drugs, and that will give our children  a  chance.  We  have  a
collective responsibility, therefore let us take it forward. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a Second time.

                          UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE

                                  (Ruling)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I need to  give  a
ruling. During question time on Wednesday, 3 October 2001, the hon  Mr  M  J
Ellis raised a point of order about a remark made by the  hon  the  Minister
of Sport and Recreation, with reference to the hon Mr T  D  Lee.  A  further
point of order in relation to the same remark was raised by  the  hon  Mr  C
Morkel.

I declared myself willing at the time to be persuaded that a  ruling  should
be made. Having had the opportunity to study the relevant  Hansard,  I  wish
to rule as follows: The contested remark, which was clearly  with  reference
to the hon Mr Lee, is contained in the following sentence:


  Chairperson, we are used to coconuts.

[Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Parliament is one of the most important public forums in  the  country,  and
it is a principle applied in most parliaments that, and  I  quote  from  the
authoritative Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice:


  Good temper and  moderation  are  the  characteristics  of  parliamentary
  language.

It must be borne in mind that members speak not so much  in  their  personal
capacity in Parliament, but  as  representatives  of  the  public.  In  that
context, offensive language usually  gives  rise  to  disorder,  which  then
prevents members from focusing on the issues of substance they  have  before
them.

The Chair, necessarily, exercises a  discretion  as  to  which  remarks  are
ruled to be offensive. However, in  the  nature  of  things,  derogatory  or
insulting remarks about a member's physical  attributes  or  appearance,  or
those based on other considerations, are clearly intended to give offense.

Referring to another member as a ``coconut'' must be regarded as  personally
offensive, and I must  therefore  ask  the  hon  Minister  to  withdraw  the
remark. [Interjections.] Order!

The MINISTER OF  SPORT  AND  RECREATION:  Chairperson,  in  withdrawing  the
remark - because I have to withdraw the remark - I clearly have to  put  the
record straight. If one reads Hansard, disk 286 and tape 295 of  3  October,
from  which   the   Chairperson   correctly   quoted,   it   clearly   says:
``Chairperson, we are used to coconuts.'' [Interjections.] That is correct.

In withdrawing this, I would like to make a  very  quick  comment.  I  would
like to stress ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, I think you  have
made an explanation, and all that is needed by the Chair, at the moment,  is
that you withdraw the offensive remark and ...

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Chairperson, I withdraw  that  remark,
but I would like to make a point that follows up on a motion that  has  been
made on this issue.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMITTEES: Order! I think someone  has  a  point  of
order! Let me hear the point of order first.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, on a point of order: You have ruled  that  the
reference to ``coconut'' is offensive and should be  withdrawn.  A  coconut,
when used in relation to coloured people, is racially offensive, because  it
says that they are  black  outside  and  white  inside.  There  are  certain
members who find that funny, but coloured people do not find  it  funny.  Mr
Balfour should just withdraw his remark unreservedly. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon  members!  Hon  Bloem,  are
you rising on a point of order?

Mr D V BLOEM: Yes, Chairperson. The Minister must withdraw his  remark,  but
the coconut is not in the House. [Laughter.] I mean,  what  is  the  use  of
withdrawing those remarks when the coconut is not here? [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, may I please  call
you to order. I would like to remind you that we are dealing with  a  matter
of great sensitivity, and I would not like the hon  House  to  make  this  a
matter of mirth.

The hon Minister has withdrawn the remark. It is within  the  discretion  of
the Chair to afford him a brief opportunity  for  an  explanation,  provided
that those remarks are confined to the question that is  being  referred  to
and do not go broader than that. It should  not  be  an  opportunity  for  a
speech. So, the hon Minister can make a very short comment.

Mr K M ANDREW: Chairperson, on a point of order: Mr Bloem has  just  made  a
point. [Laughter.] I would suggest that it  was  in  deliberate  and  direct
contempt  of  the  Chair.   You   had   hardly   given   your   ruling   ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr K M ANDREW: You had hardly finished giving your ruling that  the  use  of
the word coconut in respect of a member is  offensive  and  unparliamentary,
when that hon member stands up and says the coconut is not here.

I believe that a withdrawal in itself is not sufficient. I believe that  you
should consider the matter, and that there should be further action  against
members who deliberately defy and express contempt  of  the  Chair  in  that
way. [Applause.]

An HON MEMBER: Withdraw and say monkey nuts!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Bloem, could you please  go
to one of the microphones. In the context of the ruling that I have made,  I
think the hon Andrew is correct in pointing out that  a  matter  which  this
Parliament regards seriously cannot be made light  of,  more  especially  in
the light of the ruling that I  had  given.  I  would  like  you  please  to
withdraw your remark.

Mr D V BLOEM: I withdraw, Chairperson. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister,  you  may  make  a  very
brief explanation.

The MINISTER OF SPORT  AND  RECREATION:  It  is  going  to  be  very  brief,
Chairperson. That was never intended to be a remark against Mr  Lee  -  that
is the first thing. Secondly ... [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Let  the  hon  Minister  finish
his brief explanation.

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: ... there  are  rude  people  on  that
side. [Interjections.] In a motion that was made on this issue ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon  Minister!  I  think,  with
regard to our now going on to a secondary  matter,  I  would  not  entertain
that. The remarks have been withdrawn.

Before I recognise you, hon member, I have  a  letter  here  that  has  been
addressed to me by the hon Craig Morkel.  I  think  he  has  raised  several
matters here, but since I  have  not  had  the  opportunity  to  study  this
letter, I request that this matter be deferred further so that when  it  has
been properly reviewed we could make some sort of pronouncement on it.

So, if it is in relation to this letter, I would like to ask you  to  regard
the matter as being deferred to another time.

Mr C M MORKEL: Mr Chairperson, I accept that you will give a ruling on  this
at your earliest convenience. I drafted this letter as a point of  order  on
your ruling on the Minister's  comments  during  Question  Time,  last  week
Wednesday regarding Question 340.

There are some matters in this letter that may fall  outside  the  ambit  of
your previous ruling regarding  Wednesday,  3  October,  that  I  have  also
included, and I would also like you to include them. I raise it  now  simply
because it was said in isiXhosa and the interpreters did  not  interpret  it
immediately, and ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon  member,  let  us  avoid  creating
confusion. I have indicated that  I  will  respond  to  the  letter  in  the
appropriate manner, and I think it would be important that we  leave  it  at
that.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, on a point of  order:  There  have  been  some
extremely important matters which have been raised, which relate  to  racial
insults and their place in this Parliament. I wonder whether you  are  in  a
position to give a general ruling concerning  that  matter  or  whether  you
would be good enough to consider ruling about racial insults.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member Nel, would you  like
me first to make a comment or are you going to respond directly to that?

Mr A C NEL: Chairperson it is not a response but, perhaps, a request in  the
same vein. [Interjections.] So, I think  you  could  perhaps  deal  with  it
together. Could you perhaps  just  clarify  the  ruling  that  you  gave?  I
understood it to be that the remark itself was offensive.  I  did  not  hear
you pronounce yourself on whether  that  remark  was  racially  intended  or
otherwise. Could you perhaps clarify that?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, the hon Mr Nel  is
quite correct. In making the ruling,  I  limited  myself  to  the  offensive
remark, asked  for  that  remark  to  be  withdrawn,  and  that  remark  was
withdrawn. That completes that portion of the task that was assigned to  the
Chair.

The hon Mr Gibson raised a further point on a more general  aspect  relating
to race-based remarks. As for that and the guidelines that he is seeking,  I
think it would be appropriate to deal with this matter also  at  some  other
stage. But that would be separate from the matter that we had in  hand  this
afternoon. I hope  that  when  we  deal  with  it,  you  will  have  further
opportunities to make your inputs.
