                      PUBLIC SERVICE WAGE NEGOTIATIONS

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Madam  Speaker,  hon
members, in January this year we held the Public Service  Jobs  Summit.  For
the first time we entered into a series of  broad  discussions  with  Public
Service unions that went beyond the narrow focus on wages and conditions  of
service.

At the summit,  we  discussed  issues  relating  to  the  restructuring  and
transformation of the  Public  Service,  within  the  broader  economic  and
social framework. The outcome of the summit was a framework  agreement  that
set the stage for further constructive discussions and  engagements  on  the
restructuring of the  Public  Service  for  enhanced  service  delivery  and
improving conditions of service, focusing on the quality and  sustainability
of jobs for public servants.

Encouraged by the agreement at the Jobs Summit, and the willingness to  move
beyond the narrow and often antagonistic confines of wage  negotiations,  we
approached this year's negotiations with a renewed sense of partnership  and
optimism - a partnership, we hoped, in which  Government  and  unions  would
demonstrate a clear commitment towards improving the conditions of  service;
improving the quality and sustainability of Public  Service  jobs;  and,  of
course, extending and improving service delivery through  the  restructuring
of the Public Service. A commitment that I know that hon  members,  as  well
as legislators, do have, especially after the recent Public Service Week.

In demonstrating the commitment, we have, over the last few years, not  only
reaffirmed workers'  rights,  but  also  significantly  improved  the  basic
conditions of service of public servants. Hon members  are  aware  that  the
1996 salary agreement was one of the most far-reaching agreements,  in  many
ways.  Amongst  others,  it  unified  17   former   apartheid   configurated
administrations, with different pay  scales,  into  a  single  unified  wage
scale, and benefits were extended to all public servants equally -  that  is
medical aid, pension and the home owners' allowance.

Now, while having significant  merits,  the  1996  agreement  was  extremely
costly. The wage bill went up by almost 25% in one year. That was the  1995-
96 to 1996-97 year. Personnel costs  went  up  from  about  45%  noninterest
spending  in  1995-96,  to  54%  by  1997-98.  The  dramatic  reduction   in
nonpersonnel  expenditure  led  to  a  reduction  in  spending  on  capital,
maintenance,  training  and  complementary  inputs  such  as  textbooks  and
medical equipment. In general, we consciously had a situation where  certain
aspects of service  delivery  were  arguably  negatively  affected  by  this
squeeze.

In  consequence,  by  1998  Government  had  adopted  a  tighter  stance  on
personnel expenditure. Salary increases over the past three years were  7,1%
in 1998, 6,3% in 1999 and  6,5%  in  2000.  This  excludes  specific  salary
increases for the police in 1998 and 2001, for prosecutors in 1999  and  for
magistrates in 2000. Automatic rank promotions added about 4% points a  year
to personnel budgets in the Police Service and Health,  or  about  1%  point
for the whole public sector.

The 2001 budget  signalled  a  slightly  more  expansionary  fiscal  policy,
resulting in real growth in expenditure of about 3% a year. Even with  rapid
increases  in  infrastructure  projects  and  an  expansion  of  the  social
security net, Government can now afford  to  grow  the  wage  bill  slightly
faster than inflation over the next three years.

With the real growth of about 1,5% per year in  personnel  costs,  personnel
spending will still decline as a  percentage  of  total  spending,  enabling
Government  to  remain  focused  on  our  priorities  relating  to   capital
expenditure, social welfare and other operational expenditure.

There are a number of ways in which the wage bill can be  expanded  in  real
terms. These are through general salary increases for all  public  servants,
salary increases for specific categories of  the  Public  Service  like  the
police or educators, people with scarce  skills  -  let  us  say  maths  and
science teachers, for example -  or  by  increasing  the  number  of  people
employed in the public sector, because we daily have reports  of  overworked
nurses, police units that are understaffed,  schools  where  teachers  still
need to deal with a large number of children or welfare queues  of  hundreds
of people.

 Giving everyone a slightly above  inflation  salary  increase  may  now  be
affordable.  However,  it  is  not  likely  to  achieve  the  objectives  of
improving the efficiency and targeting of  Government  services.  Paying  an
overworked nurse or police officer may make him or her  feel  better  for  a
short while, but with not reduce stress levels and workloads.

Government would like to be in a position to do all the things it  wants  to
do, ie hiring  more  people,  giving  larger  increases  and  designing  new
measures to  attract  and  retrain  scarce  skills.  These  are  all  costly
exercises. Growing capital spending, expanding the welfare  net  and  paying
for free municipal services are demands on the same  pot.  These  trade-offs
are difficult but have to be made in a way  that  improves  the  ability  of
Government to meet its objectives with finite amounts of money.

There are many times in public policy when choices need to be  made  between
competing objectives, and this is  one  of  those  situations.  Hiring  more
people will reduce workloads and allow for an  expansion  of  services  that
Government delivers. In  keeping  with  this,  Government  is  committed  to
creating employment over the medium term in  key  service  delivery  sectors
which  include,  amongst  others,  education,  correctional   services   and
justice, health and welfare, as well as safety and security.

While the Government will be increasing employment in the above sectors,  it
is  also  true  that  there  are  areas  of  the  Public  Service  that  are
overstaffed and areas that require fundamental restructuring. We have  never
hidden this. We have said it upfront. Government and  unions  need  to  have
the tools and procedures to deal with this situation.

To this end Government remains committed to ensuring  that  a  process  that
complies with the PSCBC Resolution 7 of 2001 is implemented. What  is  that?
That is the Jobs Summit agreement that was arrived at earlier this  year  in
Pietersburg, and that is the agreement that is on the table.

The envisaged process provides a framework for ensuring that the  rights  of
public servants and the need  to  retain  jobs  are  balanced  with  service
delivery imperatives that emerge across Government. The critical  imperative
is to have a fair process and to ensure that all possible  alternatives  are
exhausted before anyone is retrenched.

The current agreement gave unions adequate time  to  negotiate  with  us  on
these issues, but insists, in order to  have  certainty,  that  all  parties
should agree to binding arbitration in  case  no  agreement  is  reached.  A
false impression is being deliberately created that we  are  forcing  unions
to agree to  retrenchments.  In  actual  fact  the  agreement  gives  us  an
opportunity to negotiate in a way that will  result  in  certainty.  I  will
quote from paragraph 8(2) of this agreement:


  The parties agree to convene a special PSCBC meeting which will remain in
  session for an uninterested period between 16  October  and  12  December
  2001, in order to conclude a collective agreement on restructuring.

The next paragraph says:
  The negotiations contemplated in clause 8(2) above, shall be  based  upon
  the principles contained  in  Resolution  7  of  2001,  specifically  the
  section titled `Procedures and processes to govern the transformation and
  restructuring  process  at  departmental,  sectoral  and  central   PSCBC
  level''.

It concludes in paragraph 8.6 that, and I quote:


  If the collective  agreement  on  restructuring  is  not  reached  by  12
  December 2001, the parties agree  to  conciliation  and  if  conciliation
  fails, binding arbitration on the processes, procedures  and  substantive
  issues.

The agreement that we have striven towards, is a step in  the  direction  of
building a  sense  of  consistency  and  moderation  and  of  balancing  our
respective approaches. The central objective of the envisaged agreement  was
a shift  away  from  antagonistic  annual  wage  increases  towards  a  more
sustainable multi-term wage policy agreement. The shift was towards a multi-
term policy agreement that allows, amongst others, for  better  planning  in
Government and less antagonistic relations between Government and labour.  A
central benefit of the medium-term agreement on wages and  restructuring  is
that it allows us to focus, with our labour  partners,  on  other  strategic
transformation and service-delivery issues.

In line with the multi-term approach, the proposed  agreements  with  unions
anticipated an annual wage increase for the 2001-02  financial  year  of  an
average of 6,58%. This  constituted  an  increase  of  R5,009  billion.  The
increases, as  anticipated,  would  have  been  effected  in  the  following
manner: For salary level 1, the lowest salary level, it would have been  8%,
for levels 2 and 3, 7% and for levels 4 to 12, 6,5%.

The annual wage increases for the 2002-03 financial  year  would  have  been
inflation plus an additional ½% and the increase for 2003-04  an  additional
1%. For the periods of 2002-03, which is next year and the year  thereafter,
the wage increases would  have  been  implemented  on  1  July.  To  protect
employer and employee from wide fluctuations in inflation, the terms of  the
agreement were subject to negotiations if the  threshold  of  inflation  was
higher than 7,5% or lower than 4%.

A  multi-term  agreement  would  also  be  in  line  with  our   Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework, the emerging medium-term strategic framework  and  in
line with our commitment to a more sustainable  pay-progression  system.  We
have also committed ourselves to pay the R850 once-off as  a  final  payment
in terms of Resolution 7 of 2001, with the expectation that  this  agreement
would pave the way for the implementation of a  new  pay-progression  system
by 1 April 2002.

In line with this, we would allocate 1% of  the  wage  bill  for  increments
effected  in  terms  of  the  pay-progression  system.  The  new  system  is
essential, as it provides a base  for  ensuring  that  pay  progression  can
serve as a strategy  for  improving  productivity  and  performance  in  the
Public Service. The shift towards a multi-term agreement  and  a  commitment
to the imperatives of restructuring would pave the way  for  more  sustained
interaction with our labour partners  on  the  critical  transformation  and
conditions of service issues.

Of particular concern  was  the  need  to  priorities  the  provision  of  a
compulsory basic health  care  package  for  all  public  servants.  As  the
Government, we believe that we have done everything possible to ensure  that
we negotiate in good faith and that, in  the  process,  we  remain  flexible
enough to accommodate the concerns and inputs from our labour  partners.  As
at this time, the majority of unions in  the  bargaining  chamber  have  not
accepted the agreement  we  presented,  and  this  is  after  a  process  of
negotiations that started in May this year, a period of six months.

The negotiating team from Government  also  spent  three  weeks  looking  in
particular  at  different  ways  in  which  everyone's  interests  could  be
accommodated. As hon members are aware, on  Tuesday  last  week  we  offered
unions until the close of business on Tuesday, that is  yesterday,  to  sign
the agreement. After their Monday caucus, unions appealed  to  us  to  amend
certain sections related to restructuring, on the basis  of  the  commitment
that this was the only issue standing between themselves and the signing  of
an agreement. As Government, we  considered  their  interests  and  effected
changes, as was proposed.

I must say, at this point, that it is still very  difficult  and  perplexing
for us as to the real reason why the agreement remains as yet unsigned.  So,
given such a response from unions and having  done  everything  possible  to
secure an agreement, I have to  inform  this  Parliament  that  we  have  no
option but to implement our initial offer of 5%, backdated to  1  July  2001
and a once-off payment of R850 in lieu of the pay progression.

We do this to ensure  that  ordinary  public  servants  are  not  denied  an
opportunity to improve their take-home pay as a result of the  intransigence
of the unions, and  also  because  we  believe  that  public  servants  have
expected an increase as from 1 July. We are not in a position  to  implement
our final wage offer, because the law, as it currently stands,  only  allows
us to implement the monetary aspects of the agreement. The agreement on  the
table is a package agreement  and  the  additional  amount  offered  was  on
condition that there was a resolution of  the  outstanding  matters  arising
from the Jobs Summit, as well as the provision of pay  progression  and  the
issues that I have raised.

To conclude, I want to  emphasise  that  we  are  committed  to  building  a
developmental state and a  developmental  Public  Service  to  underpin  it.
However,  a  developmental  state  does  not  come  into  being  by   simple
declaration and rhetoric. It requires that we transform the  Public  Service
in fundamental ways, and this includes  values  and  ethos,  equity,  skills
profiles, systems and procedures, transparency and accountability,  as  well
as efficiency and effectiveness.

We need to restructure and transform the Public Service  we  inherited  into
one that underpins a developmental state. It is a difficult,  yet  necessary
task, and I hope that hon  members  will  understand  our  process  in  this
context. I want to thank all those who tried to resolve this issue  and  who
spent sleepless nights in the process. [Applause.]

Mr M WATERS: Madam Speaker and hon members, today the hon the  Minister  for
the Public Service and Administration will sign the second  unilateral  wage
increase for the Public Service within three  years.  One  cannot  help  but
note the irony in this. After all, it  does  seem  strange  that  the  party
which is an ally of the biggest  trade  union  federation  in  this  country
imposes decisions on increases, no matter how small they may  be,  upon  the
very workers they claim to represent. Could it  be  that  Peter  Mokaba  was
correct when he stated that the alliance was, in fact, over? Surely,  it  is
only a matter of time before the SACP and Cosatu members  will  finally  put
their principles before their salary cheques and break away from the ANC.

The DA has stated with good advice time and time and  again,  the  necessity
of downsizing the Public Service. Rumour has it that the  hon  the  Minister
plans to heed our advice. We want to warn the hon the  Minister  that  there
will be dire consequences if this is  not  done  in  a  well-considered  and
planned manner. South Africa cannot afford a  repetition  of  the  education
fiasco where R1  billion  was  spent  on  retrenchment  packages,  with  the
outcome for the public being a  loss  of  highly  skilled  educators  and  a
crippled education system.

Any  retrenchment  must  take  place  in  a  systematic  and  fair   manner.
[Interjections.] I wonder what the hon the Minister is.  This  cannot  occur
without  a  proper  skills  audit  being  completed  throughout  the  Public
Service. Disappointingly, the Government has broken its promise of a  skills
audit that was initially agreed upon in the 1999 wage  settlement.  This  is
not only shortsightedness on the part of the Government, but also a lack  of
commitment both to the public and to ensuring  a  Public  Service  that  can
deliver efficiently, and to the Public Service itself in ensuring  that  the
process of  retrenchment  is  a  fair  one.  Without  a  skills  audit,  the
Government will not know what training and skills are required to equip  its
staff and, further to this, the individuals  with  the  most  to  offer  the
public in terms of service delivery might not be there  when  the  waves  of
retrenchments are over.

The  fact  that  the  Government  has  had  to  implement  salary  increases
unilaterally again, is proof  that  centralised  bargaining  is  cumbersome,
outdated and simply does not  work.  I  would  like  to  tell  the  hon  the
Minister that if staff are to adopt new ways of working  and  a  culture  of
continuous improvement, they must be rewarded for doing so. We must  provide
incentives for innovation, crosscutting thinking, collaborative working  and
excellent service delivery. Our approach to  the  issue  of  wages  must  be
incentive-based in order to ensure that the most productive and the  highest
calibre of individuals remain within the Public Service.

This means that outdated, inflexible and inefficient practices  in  pay  and
conditions such as the current wage negotiations, must be reformed  so  that
pay can be tailored to the needs of the Public Service and provide  suitable
incentives to staff. Moreover, an individual's salary should  reflect  their
output, results and performance. This means that the best  performers,  both
individuals and teams, should  be  best  rewarded.  We  must  challenge  any
system  which  gives  automatic  pay  increases  to  poor   or   inefficient
performers.

 An example that we have seen in the current  situation  is  that  of  state
attorneys who lag some 50% behind their counterparts in the private  sector.
The DA, therefore, proposes that the centralised bargaining chamber  of  the
Public Service be abolished.

In conclusion, I would like to remind Cosatu that if  they  want  to  regain
their integrity, they should take a deep breath and leave the alliance  with
the governing party. It is the only  way  they  will  stop  being  used  and
abused by the ANC. [Applause.]

Mr M S M SIBIYA: Madam Speaker, Ministers and hon  members,  we  have  heard
from the hon the Minister that her department  has  offered  a  6,5%  to  8%
salary increase across the board to  civil  servants.  And,  we  acknowledge
that there has been a lot of grappling in this regard. We  also  acknowledge
that some trade unions have threatened strike action if the negotiations  do
not go their way.

Although the Minister had issued an ultimatum to  the  unions  to  sign  the
agreement and let the Government effect the  salary  or  wage  increase  for
civil servants, if it  is  so  the  IFP  feels  that  the  Minister  is  not
negotiating in good faith.

The IFP wishes to point out that the original  offer  by  the  Minister  was
6,5% to 8%, and was then willing to  support  the  wage  increase.  We  also
acknowledge that some eight unions have agreed to  sign  the  agreement  and
the remaining four have not. I hasten to add that  this  5%  increase  which
the Minister has just mentioned is below the inflation rate. The  IFP  feels
that this is not good enough for the civil servants.

The IFP is concerned about the fact that the Minister  might  have  reverted
to this 5% increase across the board owing to  protracted  negotiations  and
the unions' padded  stance.  The  IFP  believes  that  the  power  relations
between  the   department   and   the   central   bargaining   chamber   are
overstretched. Inasmuch as we do not  wish  to  see  labour  treated  as  an
afterthought stakeholder, we do not wish to  see  the  Government  hamstrung
and held to ransom.

Government is the state itself and, as  such,  it  should  be  treated  with
deference, especially when it tries to accommodate dissenting views.  Again,
there must be convergence of thought at some stage.  Reason  and  humaneness
inform us that people should also put the interests of their  country  first
and observe that economic repercussions could be far greater  than  personal
gains.

The IFP, however, supports the unions stance on thorough  negotiations  when
it comes to the restructuring of the Public Service and/or the  retrenchment
of Public servants.  Salaries  and  the  restructuring  and/or  retrenchment
cannot always necessarily be treated as a package, and do not mean the  same
thing on the part of the employee. They can and may be treated  as  such  by
the employer and paymaster as both issues concern money on the part  of  the
employer. However, we need to understand the trade unions'  concern  in  the
light of the steep rate of unemployment and poverty. The employees  who  may
be affected by the retrenchments may be wary because they have seen  victims
of retrenchment packages in their surroundings.

We wish to point out also that there is a severe brain drain in  the  Public
Service as a result of unstructured severance packages that seem  attractive
mostly to professional personnel who can be absorbed by the private  sector.
At some point there must be clear guidelines as to  who  should  and  should
not qualify for such retrenchment packages. We also  appeal  that  the  next
market-related salary structures for the Public  Service  cut  down  on  the
year-to-year protracted wage negotiations.

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Madam Speaker, the New NP believes that the hon  the
Minister  for  the  Public  Service   and   Administration   needs   to   be
congratulated on her firm stance against Cosatu during the long  and  drawn-
out wage negotiations. [Interjections.]

She has, once again, shown why she is called the iron lady of South  African
politics. [Interjections.] I believe that the Minister's announcement  today
is proof that a cool head and a strong  will  are  needed  to  overcome  the
threats of an irresponsible Cosatu, which is doing  South  Africa  more  and
more harm through its mass action and labour strikes.

 Already the extent of the recent strikes by Cosatu and its  affiliates  are
clear with the release of figures on man-days lost owing to the  strikes  in
the third quarter of 2001. Not only have these  Cosatu-inspired  strikes  on
wage negotiations in the motor industry led to the loss of 900 000  man-days
to the South African economy, but Cosatu's strikes against the  Government's
privatisation plans have led to the loss of an additional  800  000  to  900
000 man-days, bringing the total man-days lost during this third quarter  to
an astronomical 1,7 million. No growing  economy  can  afford  irresponsible
action like this.

Further strikes over the Public Service wage settlement cannot happen  at  a
worse time for the already embattled South  African  economy.  It  is  clear
that Cosatu does not care or realise that its alliance  partners  are  still
reeling from the blows that the South  African  economy  was  dealt  by  the
unresolved Coleman Andrews saga; the postponement of  the  listing  of  SAA;
the  delay  in  the  Telkom/IPO;  and  the  Government's  policy  of  silent
diplomacy on the Zimbabwean  crisis.  Not  to  mention  the  effect  of  the
attacks on the World Trade Centre on the South African currency.

The possibility of further strikes by Cosatu is clouding  the  horizon.  The
effects of such strikes should not be underestimated, for even the  Governor
of the Reserve Bank Tito Mboweni has admitted  that  the  wage  negotiations
strikes in August had a negative effect on the value of the rand. This is  a
situation which South Africa cannot afford at this critical stage,  for  the
decline in the value of  the  rand  could  also  impact  on  South  Africa's
inflation targeting.

In the light of these factors, I believe that the time has come for the  ANC
to deal, once and for all, with its irresponsible big bad  brother,  Cosatu,
by following the example set by the hon the Minister for the Public  Service
and Administration.

Finally, I believe that every effort to speed up the  restructuring  of  the
Public Service should be supported, in order to pave  the  way  for  a  more
streamlined, effective, productive Public Service by applying the  principle
of less is more. [Applause.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Madam Speaker, while the transformation  and  integration  of
the  various  departments  that  existed  before  the  advent  of  the   new
democratic Government was never expected to be a very simple undertaking  it
must be accepted that Government has been at it now for seven years.  It  is
regrettable that it now seems to have turned on its union partners. An  army
of consultants has been used and huge amounts have been paid for  advice  on
how to steer the process. Despite this, the Public Service appears  to  have
a long way to go towards the adoption of and adherence to the principles  of
Batho Pele. I might remind members that the  Government  needed  consultants
at high price  to  be  told  to  call  teachers,  educators,  and  scholars,
learners. They might have saved the money and used it more profitably.

A critical matter, which it is hoped will prove to be  adequately  addressed
in the agreements reached thus  far,  is  the  conversion  relating  to  pay
progressions. It is understood that some types  of  incremental  scales  for
increases well into the future have been negotiated. It is  understood  that
this multi-term agreement, which  is  to  be  inflation-linked,  may  foster
greater  job  satisfaction,  because  it  is  demoralising  and,  certainly,
unprofessional for nurses and teachers to be obliged every year to  have  to
threaten to down tools or to toyi-toyi to  have  their  salaries  keep  pace
with the rate of inflation.

It is amazing to find that heads of  institutions  who  were  contacted  are
poorly informed or totally underinformed about the system used to  determine
the emoluments of their staff. Government must accept that if it treats  the
members of the Public Service as a  collection  of  illiterates,  it  cannot
expect them to behave as dynamic professionals. Along with  the  lack  of  a
proactive system of annual increments up  to  now,  a  further  demotivating
factor is the application of the Government's system of broad-banding.  This
system, as it has been applied, creates hardly any incentive for  people  in
the service to improve  their  personal  capabilities  in  their  respective
fields of operation.

What incentive is there for an official to  read  for  a  degree  in  public
administration other than to climb the ladder?  A  mathematics  teacher  who
prefers the classroom to a promotion post has to settle for a  once  off  R2
000 minus tax, for pursuing further studies. This is not reasonable.  It  is
hoped that the  restructuring,  which  the  Minister  is  engaged  in,  will
address the bitter principle and is not simply an  elaborate  plan  to  shed
jobs. [Time expired.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mevrou die Speaker, ek kan nie mooi  verstaan  nie.  Die
agb lid van die DP kom en hy kritiseer die agb Minister. Die lid van die  NP
kom en hy komplimenteer die agb Minister. Dit lyk vir my tussen  die  DA  en
die ANC is daar nou kompetisie, naamlik wie  het  die  meeste  binnegevegte.
[Gelag.] Dit is baie duidelik dat die ANC en  sy  vennoot  Cosatu  'n  sterk
geveg aan die gang het. Dit was nog altyd die uitgangspunt van  die  VF  dat
daar 'n balans moet wees tussen die belange van die werknemers aan  die  een
kant en die belange van die werkgewers aan die ander kant, in hierdie  geval
die staat. Daar was vakbonde wat die 6,5% na 8% aanvaar  het,  onder  andere
die Vereniging van Staatsamptenare. Die VF is van  mening  dit  is  onbillik
van die agb Minister om daardie vakbonde wat  wel  die  voorwaarde  aanvaar,
nou te penaliseer, omdat groter vakbonde nie daarby wil inval  nie.  Dit  is
nie konsekwent nie. Dit is nie in die kleiner vakbonde se belang nie  en  is
nie 'n ewewigtige, gebalanseerde benadering nie en daarom kritiseer  die  VF
daardie aspek. Daardie  vakbonde  wat  wel  ingestem  het,  behoort  daardie
verhoging te kry. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)
[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, I do not  understand  entirely.  The  hon
member of the DP came along and criticised the hon the Minister. The  member
of the NP came along and complimented the hon the Minister. It seems  to  me
that there is now competition between the DA and the ANC to see who has  the
most infighting. [Laughter.] It is very clear that the ANC and  its  partner
Cosatu have a strong fight going at the moment. It was always the  point  of
departure of the FF that there should be a balance between the interests  of
the employees on the one hand and the interests  of  the  employers  on  the
other, in this case the state. There were unions who accepted  the  6,5%  to
8%, amongst others the Public  Servants'  Association.  The  FF  is  of  the
opinion that it is unfair of the hon the  Minister  to  now  penalise  those
unions who have indeed accepted, because the bigger unions do  not  want  to
accept the agreement. This is not consistent. It is not in the  interest  of
the smaller unions and it is not a level-headed, balanced approach, and  for
this reason the FF is criticising that aspect. Those unions who  did  agree,
should then get that increase.]
Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, salary negotiations in  the  Public  Service
that began in June 2001 have culminated in a conciliation process  that  has
failed to break the impasse between the Government and the trade unions.  In
asserting their rights, unions have turned  a  deaf  ear  to  the  voice  of
reason,  while  the  Government  has,  in  asserting  its   rights,   become
insensitive to the pleas of the workers.

Unions are cautious not to commit themselves as they maintain that there  is
a subtle clause on retrenchments built into the agreement dealing  with  the
restructuring measures. This  brings  to  light  what  John  Coppeline,  the
former Secretary-General of Sactu once asked. He inquired as to what  unions
should do if a legitimate government, elected by a great  majority,  behaves
in the same way as the former government. The unions are now  stating  their
position. However, the Government has amended the clause  that  was  causing
discontent. The unions  must  lie  in  the  bed  that  they  have  made  for
themselves.

We appeal to all parties involved to let reason prevail, as any strike is  a
drawback, particularly if  it  involves  teachers  during  this  examination
time. It would, however, be helpful if the  Government  had  not  adopted  a
``take-it-or-leave it'' attitude, which bordered on  blackmail  when  unions
were told to accept the increase of between 6% and  8%,  or  settle  for  5%
plus the once-off payment. We are saying  patience,  tolerance  and  empathy
are key elements in building up mutual trust. [Time expired.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam  Speaker,  hon  Ministers  and  hon  members,  the  ACDP
commends the Minister for the Public Services  and  Administration  and  her
department on the successful  wage  negotiations.  We  understand  that  the
process was extremely difficult because,  on  the  one  hand,  one  has  the
demands of workers and state employees who are hard-pressed and cannot  make
ends meet, while, on the other hand, one has  a  growing  personnel  budget,
which is extremely difficult for Government to maintain.

As Government, one has the interests of the whole nation at heart, not  just
the interests of workers. Increases  must  be  related  to  performance  and
there should be no  automatic  increases  if  Government  employees  do  not
perform  according  to  expectations.  The  ACDP,  therefore,  commends  the
Minister because she managed, despite the severe pressure from  the  unions,
to stick to the Government's budget.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, we have heard what the Minister has  said  on
wage negotiations. It is important that  we  have  a  country  that  is  not
rocked by labour strikes. The only way to create  an  atmosphere  of  labour
stability in the Public Service is to pay our public servants a decent  wage
and improve their conditions of service.

It is true, of course, that money is not always available for this  purpose.
But public servants who are not adequately  paid  may  resort  not  only  to
labour strikes  and  destabilising  the  country,  but  also,  unwisely,  to
corrupt practices which may get them in  trouble.  Frequent  labour  strikes
also have an adverse effect on foreign investors. It gives them, rightly  or
wrongly, a picture of a country in which it is not safe to invest.

The PAC hopes that  improvements  in  conditions  of  service  will  prevent
situations where bodies like Sadtu go on strike on the  eve  of  the  matric
examinations, which have been a national disaster in our  country  for  many
years.

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, in politics  one  often  has  a  choice  between
doing what is popular and doing what is  right.  I  think  Minister  Fraser-
Moleketi  did  not  consider  the  claim  of  eight  of   the   12   unions.
[Interjections.] It was not a popular thing to do, but it was right  and  we
congratulate her on that. South Africa cannot be ruled by  the  unions,  and
hard-line bargaining only to show muscles cannot be yielded to.

Twee sake is egter van belang. Die eerste is dat  ons  na  die  kwessie  van
meriete  moet  kyk.  Meriete  moet  in  groter  mate  in  salarisaanpassings
verdiskonteer word.

Daar is tans amptenare wat meer as hul deel  doen  en  hulle  verdien  meer.
Daar is egter  ander  wat  bloot  op  die  golf  aanry  en  hulle  hoef  nie
verhogings te kry nie. Dié wat dit verdien, moet beloon word.

'n Tweede saak is dat dit goed is as die rieme dunner gesny  word,  en  elke
Suid-Afrikaner moet sy deel daartoe bydra. Die koek is net só groot  en  nie
groter nie. Dan geld dit almal. Mense verstaan nie hoekom hulle  die  gordel
moet styftrek as R600 miljoen aan die President se vliegtuig bestee word  en
die wapentransaksie styg van R30 na R60 miljard en word nie eens  heroorweeg
nie.  As  na   dié   twee   sake   gekyk   word,   sal   die   kwessie   van
staatsdienssalarisse ook gunstiger ontvang word.

Ons ondersteun die minister in haar ferm standpunt oor dié  onderhandelings.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Two issues, however, are of importance. The first is that we have  to  look
at the matter of merit. Merit should be taken  into  account  to  a  greater
extent in salary adjustments. Currently, there are  officials  who  do  more
than their share and they deserve more. However, there are  others  who  are
merely riding the wave and  they  need  not  receive  increases.  Those  who
deserve it, should be rewarded.

A second issue is that it is good to tighten one's  belt,  and  every  South
African must do his or her bit. The cake is only  so  big,  and  no  bigger.
This, then, applies to everybody. People do not understand why they have  to
tighten their belts when R600 million is spent on the  President's  aircraft
and the arms deal increases from R30  to  R60  billion  without  even  being
reconsidered. If we look at these two matters, the issue of  Public  Service
salaries will also be better received.

 We support the Minister in her firm standpoint on these negotiations.]

Mr P J GOMOMO: Madam Speaker, hon members, I just want to refer to  what  Mr
Groenewald said. I think his  proposal  to  the  Minister  to  give  a  full
settlement to those unions that  have  signed  would  be  an  unfair  labour
practice, and one cannot do that. As for the DA, I think they are  still  in
the wilderness. They still need to be taken through this whole agreement  to
know exactly what they are talking about,  because  people  cannot  do  away
with central bargaining. I believe that they  do  not  know  what  they  are
talking about. [Interjections.]

It is imperative to understand the content and  character  of  our  struggle
today. [Interjections.] I say this because before 1994 we were engaged in  a
particular  form  of  struggle  that  destroyed  apartheid.  Men  and  women
participated in that  form  of  struggle  within  that  particular  context.
Today's struggle has to be placed within the context of  the  transformation
and development of our country, for the benefit of our people.

Therefore, the wage dispute between Government and labour has to  be  within
a constructive development agenda, for the benefit of all South Africans.  A
dispute between the two  parties  could  be  detrimental  to  our  political
mandate to accelerate service delivery,  if  not  handled  properly.  It  is
therefore vital to place every  aspect  of  transformation  in  a  vigilant,
focused and respectful manner, in order to deal with our reformatory  agenda
correctly.

I  want  to  call  on  the  unions  and  the  Government  to  resolve  their
differences without embarking on strike action. I want  to  call  on  unions
and  Government  to  restore  trust  and  stop   being   suspicious   during
negotiations. They should show political commitment,  in  order  to  resolve
the issue within 24 hours.

To conclude, once again, let us deal with  transformation  with  a  vigilant
mind. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr D M DLALI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Ndabeni land claimants from Langa  will  be  given  land  in
           Goodwood; and


       (b)  the handing-over ceremony will be held at Wingfield  Naval  Base
           on  Saturday  and  will  be  addressed  by  the   Minister   for
           Agriculture and Land Affairs;


  (2) believes that this handing-over ceremony reflects the  commitment  of
       the Government to distribute and make land available to  historically
       disadvantaged communities; and


  (3) welcomes the restoration of land to the Ndabeni community.

Mr S E OPPERMAN: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that even the best spindoctors available can no longer deny the
       devastating effect of Aids on societies in South Africa;


  (2) believes that public representatives of  all  political  parties  who
       wish to live with their conscience must now take a stand against  the
       impudence and arrogance that has become the  hallmark  of  those  who
       must lead the fight against Aids;


  (3) supports the viewpoint of  churches,  Cosatu,  prominent  individuals
       like Rhoda Kadalie and NGOs like TAC; and


  (4) declares the present official position of  the  Government  of  South
       Africa on Aids to be a crime against our nation.
Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with concern that despite women being diagnosed with HIV/Aids as
           early as 1980, little research has been conducted  to  ascertain
           whether there are differences between men and women  in  disease
           progression, opportunistic infections  and  disease  management;
           and


       (b)  that women only account for 12% of trial participants  and  that
           male bias within research results impacts on  the  knowledge  of
           and approach to women's health needs; and


  (2) therefore resolves to -


       (a)  call on the Minister  of  Health  to  ensure  that  research  is
           engendered so as to reflect that  women  are  biologically  more
           affected; and


       (b)  focus on greater access for  women  into  clinical  trials  with
           informed consent and according to ethical considerations.

Ms N L HLANGWANA: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)   the  Minister  of  Finance,  Mr  Trevor  Manuel,  praised   the
           improvement of financial management in provinces; and


       (b)  the Minister has indicated that  the  improvement  in  financial
           management in  provinces  may  lead  to  increased  spending  in
           poverty alleviation and social development programmes;


  (2) believes that the current Government is making  significant  progress
       and is committed to effective and clean governance; and


  (3) congratulates the  Finance  Ministry  on  introducing  policies  that
       promote clean governance.

Mnr F BEUKMAN: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die huis -


  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  met ernstige kommer, van gebeure in die  Portefeuljekomitee  oor
           Binnelandse   Sake,    waar    die    prosessering    van    die
           Immigrasiewetsontwerp weer eens vertraag is;
       (b)  dat 'n voorstel van die opposisie dat  die  DG  van  Binnelandse
           Sake na die komitee geroep moet word, oor  die  beweerde  gebrek
           aan 'n dienskontrak, verwerp is;


       (c)  dat dit  ernstig  inbreuk  maak  op  die  grondwetlike  rol  van
           Parlementêre komitees om oorsig oor die uitvoerende gesag uit te
           oefen; en


       (d)  dat die huidige bestuur van die Portefeulje-komitee nie  daartoe
           bydra om wetgewende oorsig oor die Departement  van  Binnelandse
           Sake te versterk nie; en


  (2) dringend 'n beroep doen op die Speaker om 'n ondersoek na die bestuur
       en leierskap van die komitee in te stel.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr F BEUKMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the New NP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with serious concern events in the Portfolio Committee  on  Home
           Affairs, where the processing of the Immigration Bill  has  once
           again been delayed;


       (b)  that a proposal by the opposition, that the DG of  Home  Affairs
           be called to the committee regarding a service contract which is
           allegedly missing, was rejected;


       (c)  that this is a serious infringement of the  constitutional  role
           of parliamentary  committees  to  exercise  oversight  over  the
           executive authority; and


       (d)  that the current management of the portfolio  committee  is  not
           contributing to the strengthening of legislative oversight  over
           the Department of Home Affairs; and
  (2) urgently appeals to the  Speaker  to  conduct  an  inquiry  into  the
       management and leadership of the committee.]

Ms A VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  yesterday was the 3rd anniversary  of  the  Partnership  Against
           Aids initiative;


       (b)  no amount of semantic games and suppression of  statistics  will
           change the fact that thousands of South Africans are dying,  and
           that millions more will die if the Government continues to allow
           itself to be misled  by  the  ANC  and  President  Mbeki's  ill-
           considered ideas on the subject; and


       (c)  Deputy President Zuma yesterday claimed that HIV/Aids  awareness
           was higher than 90% among South Africans;


   (2)      questions whether this 90% awareness is an accurate figure,  and
       whether it does not to a large degree reflect a  huge  awareness  of
       inaccurate and irresponsible ideas  around  HIV/Aids,  such  as  the
       President's claims that HIV/Aids is not caused by a virus; and


   (3)      calls on the ANC to attend to this matter  of  extreme  national
       interest by rising to the challenge and meeting  it  with  maturity,
       even if this means once and for  all  withdrawing  its  leader  from
       comment or decision-making on HIV/Aids.

Mr L ZITA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes reports that the  job  creation  fund  set  up  by  Cosatu  has
       delivered jobs for unemployed workers;


  (2) believes that this successful job creation initiative led  by  Cosatu
       is further evidence of Cosatu's commitment to the ideal of  a  better
       life for all and  its  serious  concern  about  the  high  levels  of
       unemployment; and


  (3) calls on other stakeholders, business in particular, to  invest  more
       in job creation.

[Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UCDP:


  That the House -


  (1) Notes that -


       (a)  notes that whereas  efforts  are  being  made  to  ensure  that
           relations among citizens are cordial, farmworkers remain at  the
           receiving end; and


       (b)  some farm owners persist in assaulting, abusing,  torturing  and
           even shooting at workers on their farms with impunity;


  (2) believes that enough is enough and calls on -


       (a)  farmers to desist from such  conduct and treat other  people  as
           they themselves would like to be treated; and


       (b)  the criminal justice system agents to get their act together and
           show their teeth to such perpetrators; and


  (3) hopes that the forum set up under the chairmanship of Rev   Mvambo in
       the North West Province to address such intolerances will go  a  long
       way towards making the different races find and accept one another as
       people of the same country.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the PAC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the rand has reached its lowest point against the US dollar  and
           the British pound; and


       (b)  not long ago the decline in the value  of  the  rand  was  being
           blamed on the PAC utterances on land as well as on the situation
           in Zimbabwe;


  (2) observes that the Zimbabwe dollar is  improving  while  the  rand  is
       continually sliding;


  (3) appeals to the accusers of the PAC to study the science of  economics
       further; and


  (4) concludes that it is very clear that the PAC  was  never  responsible
       for the decline  in  the  value  of  the  rand  and,  therefore,  the
       detractors of the PAC have a mistaken identity in their hands and are
       backing the wrong horse for the decline of the rand.

[Interjections.]

Mr S A MSHUDULU: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) Notes -


       (a)  the ongoing military strikes against a  number  of  targets  in
           Afghanistan being conducted by the United States and Britain;
       (b)  that these operations are aimed at military targets;

  (2) reaffirms its  unequivocal  condemnation  of  the  terrorist  attacks
       against various cities in the United States;


  (3) calls on the United States and  Britain  to  ensure  the  safety  and
       security of noncombatant civilians, especially women and children in
       the targeted areas; and


  (4) calls upon all South Africans to  abide  by  the  provisions  of  the
       Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act, No 15 of 1998,  which
       prohibits the recruitment of South African citizens  to  participate
       in mercenary activities in other countries.

[Applause.]

Mr M WATERS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes the sudden resignation of ``Mr Big Spender'', Ekurhuleni  Metro
       Mayor Mr Vilakazi, after only 10 months in office;


  (2) welcomes this as a relief for ratepayers who were having to  pay  for
       his spending spree, including -


       (a)  a R500 000 inauguration party;


       (b)  a R560 000 armoured Mercedes-Benz; and


       (c)  R400 000 spent on improving his mayoral offices;


  (3) expresses its appreciation to the DA opposition in  Ekurhuleni  Metro
       for calling the spendthrift mayor to account and putting pressure  on
       the ANC to stop this wastage; and


  (4) calls on the new mayor to put the interests of the  people  ahead  of
       personal enrichment.
Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1)  congratulates  all  provincial  winners  of  the  Emerging   Tourist
       Entrepreneur of the Year Award that was held  recently  in  order  to
       promote  domestic  and  international  tourism   in   South   Africa,
       especially Mr Edward Ngwenya of the  Crocodile  Creek  Guesthouse  in
       Pongola, KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) also congratulates the Kingsway High School,  in   KwaZulu-Natal,  on
       having won first place in the schools competition  entailing  a  case
       study on sports tourism, entitling it to compete with  other  schools
       from around the world in Philadelphia, USA; and


  (3) believes that tourism to South Africa will definitely be  boosted  by
       these seemingly small but giant steps towards marketing South  Africa
       to domestic and international clients.

Mr R P ZONDO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes reports that both the DP  and  the  New  NP  have  fraudulently
       inflated their membership figures by  paying  residents  in  old  age
       homes to sign up, including nonexistent and even dead people;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  this power struggle-characterised by a  severe  lack  of  trust,
           accusations and backstabbing - is just one more  battle  in  the
           grab for power in the DA; and


       (b)  that this scam to boost their respective  demands  in  the  DA's
           constitutional negotiations is a reflection  of  the  entrenched
           corruption of both parties; and


  (3) calls on ordinary members of the DA to seriously  reconsider  whether
       they want to be associated with a party that has neither scruples nor
       morals.

[Applause.]

Mnr A S VAN DER MERWE: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat  ek  op
die volgende sittingsdag namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem  van  die  haglike  toestande  in  die  landbousektor  na
       aanleiding van die volgende:


       (a)  die derde arbeidsmagopname van Statistiek SA toon dat die aantal
           werknemers in bestaansboerderye of  kleinskaal  boerderye  geval
           het van 1,5 miljoen werkers in Februarie 2000 na 653 000 werkers
           in Februarie 2001;


       (b)  die skade van die onlangse kouefronte in die Vrystaat en KwaZulu-
           Natal tot R100 miljoen kan wees; en


       (c)    die   landbousektor   voortdurend   gekniehalter   word   deur
           plaasaanvalle op beide die werkgewers en werknemers; en


  (2) 'n beroep doen op die Regering om samesprekings te voer  met  al  die
       leiers in die landbousektor, en die nodige stappe te doen om  bystand
       te verleen aan diegene in hierdie belangrike  sektor  van  die  Suid-
       Afrikaanse ekonomie wat spoedeisend en dringend hulp nodig het.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A S VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the New NP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes the critical situation in the agricultural sector as  a  result
       of the following:


       (a)  the third labour force survey by Statistics SA  shows  that  the
           number of  employees  in  subsistence  farming  and  small-scale
           farming has dropped from 1,5 million workers in February 2000 to
           653 000 workers in February 2001;


       (b)  damage caused by the recent cold fronts in the  Free  State  and
           KwaZulu-Natal could total as much as R100 million; and


       (c)  the  agricultural  sector  is  continuously  hamstrung  by  farm
           attacks on both employers and employees; and


  (2) appeals to the Government to hold talks with all the leaders  in  the
       agricultural sector, and  to  take  the  steps  necessary  to  render
       assistance to those in this important sector  of  the  South  African
       economy who are in need of rapid and urgent relief.]

Mr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1)  notes  that  Nafcoc  and  Sacob,  two  of  the  largest  federations
       representing  South  African  business,  are  in   the   process   of
       negotiating a merger;


  (2) recognises that  many  organisations  that  represent  South  African
       business remain divided along racial lines;


  (3) acknowledges the importance of unified,  nonracial  organisations  to
       represent the interests of South African business, whilst recognising
       the equally important  need  to  bring  everyone  on  board  in  such
       initiatives and to negotiate in good faith; and


  (4)  encourages  Safcoc,  and  other  similar  business  initiatives  and
       business leaders, to continue on the visionary  path  of  practically
       combining forces, in the interest  of  business  and  entrepreneurial
