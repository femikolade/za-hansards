[Mr Q J KGAUWE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -

Mr B G BELL: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock that -


       (a)  the Mpumalanga legislature building, budgeted at R120 million,
           has already cost R612 million, and a further expenditure of R40
           million is expected;


       (b)  these costs are set to escalate as a result of further
           commitments; and


       (c)  all departments are experiencing budget cuts to cover these
           exorbitant costs, and this is seriously affecting delivery to
           the people; and


  (2) calls on the Minister of Finance to invoke section 100 of the
       Constitution so that the central Government can curb the reckless
       spending of the ANC government in this province.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]
Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) learns with utter shock of the rail accident that took place over the
       weekend that left two people dead and 55 injured;


  (2) is dismayed by the action of the train driver who got behind the
       stationary train involved in an accident, when warnings were
       allegedly conveyed to him to take precautions;


  (3) is concerned about people who commit suicide on railway lines at the
       peril of a sizeable number of railway commuters; and


  (4) calls upon the Department of Transport to search for methods that can
       bring about safety on railway lines jeopardised by suicidal acts.

Mr N M DUMA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the people of Uganda went to the polls yesterday to elect a
           president for their country; and


       (b)  yesterday's presidential elections were free of violent
           incidents;


  (2) believes that political tolerance and peace contribute positively to
       free and fair elections and to the strengthening of democracy; and


  (3) commends the people of Uganda for exercising their right to choose
       their leader in conditions of peace.

[Applause.]

Mr C M MORKEL: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the presence of representatives from the Parkwood community in
       the South Peninsula administrative area of Cape Town, who are sitting
       in the gallery today in silent protest against the incidents of
       crimes against our children and youth reported over the weekend ...

[Interjections.]


  (2) expresses outrage at the violent murder of a young couple, Sheldon
       Arends, 20 years old, and Valencia Hendricks, 19 years old, who were
       killed in a drive-by shooting outside a family member's home in
       Parkwood;


  (3) calls on the Minister of Safety and Security to transfer more powers,
       police and other resources to provincial and local governments, such
       as the DA-governed Western Cape and the City of Cape Town, which are
       more than competent to manage a fully-staffed and fully-funded child
       and youth protection service with greater effectiveness than from
       Pretoria; and


  (4) encourages other communities to follow the lead of the Parkwood
       community which is standing together and taking a strong stand
       against crime in its area by participating in crime prevention
       initiatives.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with distress that the postal strike has entered its third
       week, with no sign of any solution being agreed upon between workers
       and management;


  (2) urges the SA Postal Service and the Communication Workers Union (CWU)
       to conclude their negotiations and reach a settlement; and


  (3) further notes that ordinary citizens are bearing the brunt of this
       lack of service delivery due to the strike, and that, at the same
       time, a negative message is being sent to investors that we are
       currently not able to provide effective, basic services such as a
       postal service in this country.

Mr N J GOGOTYA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the 12th Report for the year 1998 of Scopa in which the then
       accounting officer of the Department of Communications, Mr Solly
       Kotane, was held liable for a loss of about R1,6 million to the
       state;


  (2) further notes that, according to the report from the Treasury and the
       State Attorney, the same individual cannot be traced;


  (3) notes that he recently, amidst much fanfare and publicity, joined the
       DP, which remained silent on this matter during the deliberations of
       Scopa; and


  (4) calls on the DP's spokesperson in Scopa, Ms Taljaard, to assist the
       criminal justice system by providing it with the whereabouts of Mr
       Kotane.

[Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that the medical director of BA Travel, Dr Jamieson, has issued
           a warning that dengue fever, a purportedly incurable viral
           infection transmitted by mosquitoes, like malaria, has reached
           epidemic proportions in Sao Paulo;


       (b)  that poor living conditions in slums around many third world
           countries are leading to the disease making a comeback across
           the tropical and subtropical world; and


       (c)  that Dr Jamieson said that certain parts of South Africa could
           fall victim to outbreaks of the disease, and that a failure to
           invest in mosquito control and eradication programmes and to
           prevent rubbish accumulation around human settlements could
           result in the appearance of the disease; and


  (2) calls upon the Minister of Health to tighten public health measures
       in South Africa to prevent an outbreak of this disease.

Dr C P MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:
  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem daarvan dat die Minister van Onderwys, mnr Kader Asmal,
       dit oorweeg om in die toekoms studente se aansoeke om toegang tot
       hoër onderwys-inrigtings in 'n sentrale kantoor te laat verwerk;


  (2) verder kennis neem dat die doel hiervan, volgens die Minister, sal
       wees om universiteittoelatings te beheer ten einde die rasse- en
       geslagsamestelling van instellings te beheer;


  (3) sy kommer uitspreek oor hierdie beoogde blatante ingryping in die
       outonomie van tersiêre instellings; en


  (4) 'n beroep doen op die Minister om instellings toe te laat om studente
       op grond van hulle akademiese kwalifikasies en meriete toe te laat en
       nie op grond van ras en geslag nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FF:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Minister of Education, Mr Kader Asmal, is considering
       having students' applications for admission to tertiary education
       institutions processed in a central office in future;


  (2) further notes that the objective of this, according to the Minister,
       will be to control university admissions in order to control the race
       and gender composition of institutions;


  (3) expresses its concern at this envisaged blatant interference in the
       autonomy of tertiary institutions; and


  (4) appeals to the Minister to allow institutions to admit students on
       the basis of their academic qualifications and merit, and not on the
       basis of race and gender.]

Mr L M KGWELE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes the initiative taken by Mr Lourie van Reenen, a farmer from
       Christiana in the North West province, who built a school at a cost
       of R1,5 million for the children of farmworkers;


  (2) further notes that Mr Van Reenen has provided teachers'
       accommodation, a bus to transport children from the neighbouring
       African community and insurance of R20 million for the learners;


  (3) believes that it is ordinary patriots such as Mr Van Reenen who make
       us all proud to be South Africans; and


  (4) commends all businesspeople and citizens who have heeded our call to
       unity in action against poverty.

[Applause.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the lavish inaugural ceremony of the ANC Ekurhuleni executive
           mayor costing R400 000;


       (b)  President Mbeki's address to the nation in which he prioritised
           fighting poverty and ensuring service delivery; and


       (c)  DA-run councils' modest mayoral inaugurations, including -


           (i)   R8 000 for Mossel Bay;


           (ii)  R7 000 for Midvaal; and


           (iii) R1 000 for George, where private sponsors covered most
                  costs;


  (2) deplores the extravagant waste of ratepayers' money;


  (3) commends the DA councillors for boycotting the wasteful inauguration
       of the Ekurhuleni mayor; and


  (4) urges the Minister for Provincial and Local Government to take urgent
       steps to ensure that municipalities focus on service delivery and on
       putting the people first.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) is duly shocked to learn that some police officers defy departmental
       regulations by operating private businesses, ranging from
       moneylending and funeral parlours to moonlighting in private security
       companies, even during office hours;


  (2) is appalled to learn that Durban's head of the Organised Crime Unit,
       Mr Piet Meyer, enriched himself by soliciting bribes from casino
       owners whose illegal operations he was supposed to bust; and


  (3) abhors, in the strongest terms, the corruption practices of police
       officers, and calls upon the Department of Safety and Security to
       root out these corrupt elements.

Ms D M MOROBI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the SAPS in Gauteng for arresting 34 people involved in
       child prostitution in Johannesburg;


  (2) praises those SAPS members who blew the whistle on their colleagues'
       involvement in child prostitution; and


  (3) calls on all citizens who witness the activities of those involved in
       crimes which undermine the rights of children to come forward and
       assist the criminal justice system in protecting the rights and
       safety of our youth.

[Applause.]

Mr H A SMIT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the unsatisfactory situation resulting from the fact that the
       Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services has not yet successfully
       met this year, even though we are in week 11, and that there is
       important legislation that needs to be passed and a chairperson also
       needs to be appointed;


  (2) further notes that there was a feeble attempt to convene a meeting
       this morning without proper notice being given, and since there was
       no notice of this meeting on today's Order Paper, predictably, there
       was no quorum;


  (3) expresses concern about the fact that our Vote will be discussed on 5
       April 2001, and that if we do not get the opportunity to raise issues
       in the committee beforehand, we cannot be expected to participate
       constructively in our Vote ...

[Interjections.]


  (4) further notes that serious allegations are surfacing in the press
       regarding the DG, and as the parliamentary watchdog we should have
       ample time to deal with these important issues; and


  (5) calls on the Leader of Government Business and the Speaker to deal
       with this matter appropriately, since this should not be an
       advertisement for Parliament and democracy.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) recognises the fears of the Chamber of Mines and of local and
       national mining houses regarding the controversial Minerals
       Development Bill, which has been published for public comment;


  (2) notes that the mining houses are bridling at this proposed
       legislation with profound indignation and disenchantment, since they
       believe that the Bill infringes on and undermines fundamental rights
       and certainty sought by investors that they will be able, upon the
       passage of the legislation, to hold onto their old-order mineral
       rights;


  (3) is alarmed at the failure of the Government to honour assurances
       given to the mining industry leaders during top-level discussions,
       which included the President, towards the end of last year; and


  (4) calls on the Minister of Minerals and Energy to heed the call of the
       Chamber of Mines and the mining houses to withdraw the Bill.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                         (The late Nomakhwezi Hani)

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House-


  (1) notes the untimely death of Nomakhwezi, daughter of the assassinated
       former secretary general of the SACP, Mr Chris Hani, and Mrs Limpho
       Hani, a former ANC member of Parliament;


  (2) conveys its heartfelt condolences to the Hani family; and


  (3) joins them in mourning the loss of their beloved daughter.

Agreed to.

                        ARGUS PICK 'N PAY CYCLE TOUR

                             (Draft Resolution)
Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I hereby move without notice:


  That the House-


  (1) notes that the Argus Pick 'n Pay Cycle Tour took place on Sunday in
       Cape Town and that approximately 35 000 cyclist participated in this
       event;

       and 58 seconds;


  (3) further congratulates the organisers and sponsors of this event on
       its success; and

       nation-building.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Agreed to.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                        (The late Mrs Kotie de Beer)

Mnr C H F GREYLING: Mev die Speaker, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Huis-


  (1) kennis neem van die tragiese dood van mev Kotie de Beer wat verlede
       week deur 'n luiperd in die Nasionale Kruger Wildtuin se

  (3) hulde bring aan alle personeel van Suid-Afrika se nasionale parke wat
       die natuurskatte van Suid-Afrika in stand hou, bewaar vir ons
       nageslag, en soms met hul lewens daarvoor boet.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr C H F GREYLING: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the tragic death of Mrs Kotie de Beer, who was killed by a
       leopard in the staff village at Skukuza in the Kruger National Park
       last week;


  (2) conveys its sympathy and condolences to her husband, family and
       friends and to the staff of the Kruger National Park; and


  (3) pays tribute to all staff members of the national parks of South

     CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF AD HOC COMMITTEE ON REPORT 13 OF PUBLIC
                                  PROTECTOR

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker ... [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker and hon members, it is my pleasure to present to
the National Assembly the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Report 13 of
the Public Protector.

This morning, I came to work much earlier than usual. Upon seeing me, a
member of the parliamentary staff coming off night duty remarked: ``I
thought that the case of the Minister was over.'' I think that he captured
very neatly two common misconceptions. Firstly, that our committee was
dealing with the case and, secondly, that the subject of the case was
Minister Penuell Maduna. I think, therefore, that it would be proper to
give some background to the events leading to this report.

These events date back to 1996 and it seems that the passage of time has
clouded our understanding of the issues before us today. This matter has
its origin in the question that was posed to Minister Maduna, then Minister
of Minerals and Energy Affairs, by Mr Kobus Jordaan, who was then a DP
member of Parliament.

In the course of responding to that question, the Minister raised a number
of issues regarding the functioning of the Strategic Fuel Fund and, in
doing so, suggested that the then Auditor-General had assisted in covering
up an alleged loss of R170 million from the SFF. Objections were raised
that those remarks were in contravention of Rule 99, which is now Rule 66,
in that the Minister had reflected on the honour and competency of the
Auditor-General other than by way of substantive motion.

A committee was constituted to look at the alleged breach of Rule 99 and
matters raised by the Minister. The committee found that the Minister had,
indeed, contravened Rule 99 and recommended that he should withdraw his
remarks and apologise. The committee also recommended that the substantive
matters raised by the Minister be referred to the Public Protector for
investigation. The Minister duly apologised unreservedly and withdrew his
remarks unconditionally. As far as the Assembly was concerned, this aspect
of the matter had been disposed of.

From that point onwards, matters raised by the Minister were being dealt
with in a manner more or less envisaged by the Rules of the Assembly. They
had been encapsulated in a resolution formally adopted by the Assembly and
referred to the Public Protector for investigation. It is these matters
that form the bulk of the Public Protector's investigation and report. It
is on these matters that the committee interacted with the Public Protector
at length and constituted the focus of our work. The Assembly gave us the
mandate to consider the Public Protector's report. We understood this to
mean consideration of the report in its totality.

I have made these remarks not, as some might suggest, to divert attention
from any issue, but rather in an attempt to restore focus on what the real
issues are. The Public Protector, in his presentation to our committee,
captured very well what we considered to be the real issues, and I quote:


  The SFF Association is a wholly-owned Government company worth more than
  R13 billion. It was, therefore, necessary to investigate the serious
  allegation of irregularities in the SFF in order to rectify what was
  wrong and improper, and in order to report to the shareholder about the
  state of affairs within this asset of the state and, if appropriate, to
  give it a clean bill of health.


  As a result of this investigation, certain structural adjustments are
  going to have to be made within the SFF. Financial management within the
  SFF is going to have to be reorganised and strengthened. The taxpayer is
  going to be reassured that this company, which pays dividends of millions
  to the state, is going to be even better managed in future.


  Organs of state are going to have to take a fresh look at their
  relationships with each other in terms of section 41 of the Constitution,
  thereby ensuring that what has happened is not repeated in future.
  Therefore it should be clear that the initial issue of the R170 million
  ``loss'' was but one element in this whole saga. Further, in view of the
  above, about the money which was spent mainly in the form of legal fees
  on this investigation, I can state without fear of contradiction that
  every cent was well worth it.

[Interjections.] I have been quoting the Public Protector. [Interjections.]
I would like, on behalf of the committee, to thank the Public Protector and
the staff in his office for the assistance which they provided to the
committee and the very cordial and constructive manner in which we were
able to interact with them. Other speakers will deal with the findings of
the Public Protector at greater length.
The Public Protector makes the overall finding that whilst there were minor
technical difficulties with the abbreviated 1992-93 financial statements as
published by the Auditor-General, they could not be said to be misleading
or inappropriate. Whilst the committee accepted this and other findings of
the Public Protector, the committee, nonetheless, felt the need to draw the
following matters to the attention of the Assembly.

The CEF Group and SFF Association were instrumental in attempts by the
apartheid state to break the international oil embargo imposed by the
United Nations in protest against apartheid. As such, these organisations
operated behind a veil of secrecy and conducted operations that were, by
definition, in contravention of international law. In order to pursue these
objectives, the structure and functioning of the SFF was such that it made
political and administrative accountability difficult.

There are certain allegations, in particular concerning the diversion of
funds from the SFF for political purposes, that the committee is not
necessarily satisfied, were isolated incidents. The committee is of the
view that a forensic investigation into such matters would have been in the
public interest.

The Public Protector identified a number of very serious shortcomings in
the corporate governance of the SFF, ie contraventions of SFF policy and
weaknesses in internal control mechanisms, as well as incidents of outright
maladministration. The Public Protector made a number of recommendations
relating to the SFF in particular, but also to other public enterprises and
organs of state. These matters will be addressed more fully by other
speakers.

The ad hoc committee was not in the best position to take these
recommendations forward. Accordingly, we recommended that these matters be
referred to the Portfolio Committees on Minerals and Energy, Public
Enterprises and Public Service and Administration, and that they should
report to the National Assembly.

In his report, the Public Protector points out that neither section 181 nor
section 41 of the Constitution provides any sanction for their
transgression. He refers to this as a constitutional weakness that can only
be remedied by Parliament itself, and that these matters are serious enough
not even to be adequately addressed by a simple apology.

The committee did not wish to express itself on whether the weakness
referred to lies in the Constitution or in the legislative and other
measures that the Constitution enjoins other organs of state to take to
protect institutional support in democracy. However, there was agreement in
the committee that the institutions supporting democracy created in Chapter
9 of the Constitution play an extremely vital role in our democracy, and
that measures should be taken to protect their independence, impartiality,
dignity and effectiveness.

We recommended that these matters be referred to the Portfolio Committee on
Justice and Constitutional Development and also to the Constitutional
Review Committee. However, subsequent to the finalisation of our report, it
was pointed out to us that it was not in the nature of the Constitutional
Review Committee to have matters referred to it by the National Assembly.
Therefore, we will propose the following amendment to our report:


  The substitution of paragraph 5(4)(d) with the following:
     The committee recommends that these matters be referred to the
     Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development for
     consideration and report and be submitted to the Constitutional Review
     Committee.

With regard to the recommendation by the Public Protector that the National
Assembly pronounces itself on the accountability of the Minister and any
possible sanction that the National Assembly might consider appropriate,
the committee considered the following factors: Firstly, that the National
Assembly had already found that the Minister had acted in contravention of
the Rules of the National Assembly, and that the Minister had apologised
and withdrawn his remarks. Here the committee could not agree with the
Public Protector, who seemed to be under the impression that the Minister
apologised but did not withdraw his remarks.

Secondly, that the Public Protector found that the Minister had not acted
in bad faith by raising the matters that he did. Thirdly, that the National
Assembly had not constituted our committee as a disciplinary committee in
which the rules of natural justice could be properly applied. Fourthly,
that we took into account the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeal in
the matter of The Speaker of the National Assembly vs De Lille and Another.
We are of the opinion that, in the light of this judgment, neither the
Rules of the National Assembly nor the Powers and Privileges of Parliament
Act provide an adequate framework within which to deal with matters such as
the above.

Arriving at a verdict and imposing a sanction in the absence of clear
rules, sanctions and procedures would have placed the committee, and by
extension the National Assembly, in the invidious position of not only
being judge, jury and prosecutor, but also lawmaker at the same time. We
are of the opinion that little of lasting value to our democracy would
emerge from a decision taken, and a precedent set under such circumstances.
We believe that the responsible course of action under the circumstances is
the one that we have suggested, namely to allow those structures of the
National Assembly best qualified to do so to consider these matters soberly
and dispassionately, not in the heat of political controversy, and to come
up with recommendations as to how these matters should best be dealt with
in future.

Accordingly, we recommend that these matters be referred to the Rules
Committee of the National Assembly. We believe that in doing so, we would
have acted in a manner that strengthens the rule of law, our Constitution
and the democracy for which so many of our compatriots fought and died.
[Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Mevrou die Speaker, u het nou die agb Andries Nel se
weergawe gehoor; nou gaan u die korrekte weergawe hoor. [Madam Speaker, you
have now heard the hon Andries Nel's version; now you will hear the correct
version.]

The last weeks have been watershed weeks in the history of parliamentary
democracy in South Africa. And if hon members of the ANC are not ashamed,
they should be. The democratic Parliament established in 1994 has been
damaged by the actions of the ANC, its Ministers and its members.

The major tests posed to Parliament by the arms deal allegations and the
Maduna affair were both major failures and should be major embarrassments
to the ANC. I am aware of certain members of the Government who are
discomforted by the anti-democratic and empty democratic actions of their
members, and more than a few are appalled by the backward step taken by
South Africa.

The accountability of the executive to Parliament was, in the case of
Scopa, stood on its head. The committee became accountable to the Ministers
instead of the other way round. In the case of the Maduna affair the
executive was in effect found not to be accountable at all.

In one case parliamentary oversight was in the hands of the hon Andrew
Feinstein. In the other case it was in the hands of the hon Andries Nel.
The difference between Andrew and Andries is that Andrew was widely
recognised as being a man of independence and unimpeachable integrity. He
had to be got rid of. Andries on the other hand was someone who was
recognised as being a loyal apparatchik who would do what he was
instructed. [Interjections.] Andrew is gone and Andries remains. I wonder
if the hon Mr Nel enjoyed Robert Kirby's assessment of him, ``an odious and
smug African National Congress flunky!'' What a tosspot!

The ANC's attitude towards independent organs of state is instructive. When
it suits them they pay obeisance, when it does not suit them they simply
ignore these organs. The so-called Nel Committee took more than a year to
come to the conclusion that nothing could be done about Minister Maduna.
And they did so on specious grounds.

One of these grounds was to quote selectively from the De Lille case and to
ignore certain words in an endeavour to change the meaning of the findings.
The National Assembly must understand that the Chief Justice did not find
that we cannot take steps against a member. The Chief Justice found that
Parliament could not suspend an MP's membership or ban them from attending
other than in the course of restoring order in the House. He did not find
that we cannot reprimand a member.

To use this judgment as a pretext for failure to act is therefore not
tenable. And of course there is a serious difference between the case of
the hon Patricia De Lille and that of Minister Maduna. She was subjected to
jungle justice by a committee of this House, and I am proud to say, against
the protests of the whole opposition. Minister Maduna was found by the
Public Protector to have violated the Constitution. Even members of the ANC
should be able to admit that there is a difference. [Interjections.]

The other pretext that the ANC used to protect the Minister was to say that
the Public Protector was wrong in stating that the Minister had not
withdrawn his remarks. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member would you take your seat, please. We have a
point of order.

Mr P A C HENDRICKSE: Madam Speaker, is it in order for the person at the
podium to refer to the findings of a parliamentary committee as ``jungle
justice''? [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam, the hon member should refer to the Judge Klopper
court finding, and then he will know about it. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Mr Gibson! [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: I withdraw the remark. I want to quote from a letter which
the Minister wrote to the Speaker on 19 August 1998. And he said as
follows:


  To the extent that the aforesaid committee has found that I breached the
  Rule ...

He did not say - ``I am sorry for what I said''.


  To the extent that ... I breached the Rule ...

That was the parliamentary Rule -


  ... I hereby withdraw the relevant remarks unconditionally and apologise
  to you and to the National Assembly.

Then he went on to say:


  Furthermore, it is my understanding that the substance and veracity of
  the remarks complained of will be dealt with appropriately by and before
  the Public Protector.

That is what he was saying then. He was still saying to the Speaker that
there was veracity and truth in his remarks. The truth of the matter is
that at that time he had known for more than a year that his remarks were
untrue and uncalled for. But he still wrote to the Speaker in those terms.

It is quite clear that the hon Minister did not withdraw or apologise for
the constitutional violation, even though he had known for 14 months that
it was such. The effrontery of the hon Minister knows no bounds. He wanted
to be pardoned for his breach of the Rule of the House, but he still
pretended to the House that there was a basis of veracity to his remarks.

When the ANC majority decided that the Public Protector was wrong in his
conclusion, I requested that committee to refer to the Public Protector for
clarification of his remarks - it would have been quite simple to do so.
Significantly, the hon Mr Nel declined to agree. Even more significant was
that during the days of the hearings when the Public Protector appeared
before this very committee, not one of those members who were going to use
this as a fig leaf put that question to him.

Hon members will not know that there was a minority report which was drawn
up by me and which was subsequently assented to by six opposition parties.
The opposition saw right through the ANC stratagem and wished to report to
the House in a minority report. Mr Nel ruled that that was contrary to the
Rules of Parliament. I call upon the hon Dullah Omar to come back - all is
forgiven. [Interjections.] My colleague the hon Raenette Taljaard of Scopa
has raised the possible unconstitutionality of the Rule with the Speaker.
That is as may be.

It is of significance that the opposition of this country, representing
almost one voter in three, has a view diametrically opposed to that of ANC
members who decided that they could do nothing to Minister Maduna. The
whole opposition united around the idea that the Public Protector's report
had to be taken seriously, and that an appropriate punishment for Minister
Maduna had to be considered. We did not want to hang him, we did not even
want to fine him. We proposed that he should appear in the House, that he
should be reprimanded for being in violation of the Constitution, and that
he should be given an opportunity to apologise unreservedly for his breach
of the Constitution. Even that merest little tap on the wrist was too much
for the ANC - they wanted the Minister to get off scot-free.

It concerns me mightily that the Minister has cost the taxpayer a fortune.
He has cost us R30 million for this enquiry and for his legal fees.
[Interjections.] He knew within days of making his statement in Parliament
in 1997 that the allegations were incorrect and untrue. But instead of
being big enough to take the first opportunity to put matters right, he
allowed all of this taxpayer's money to be wasted.

To him R30 million is nothing. To those of us who work with the voters at
grass-roots level in the townships and in the suburbs R30 million is a
fortune. [Interjections.] Vir die mense daar buite is R30 miljoen 'n
fortuin. [To the people out there R30 million is a fortune.] It is
disgraceful to waste the taxpayer's money in this way. This hon Minister
has not even said sorry. Does he have no shame at all? [Interjections.]

The Minister allowed Parliament's previous committee to go ahead for a year
before he withdrew his remarks for the purposes of the breach of the Rules.
During the course of that hearing, he instructed his legal adviser ...
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, would you take your seat, please.

Mr N J GOGOTYA: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: We find it difficult to
hear what is being said, because of the rent-a-crowd in the gallery that is
making a noise. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! All members of the House are making sure that the
debate is not being heard. I do not think that you should blame the public
gallery. Let us look at our own conduct first. [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, during the course of the proceedings of the
previous committee ...

The SPEAKER: Order! Mr Gibson, will you take your seat.

Mr M M CHIKANE: Madam Speaker, will the speaker take a question?

The SPEAKER: Order! Will you take a question, hon member?

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, as soon as I finish my speech, I will be
delighted to take a question. [Interjections.]

During the course of the previous parliamentary committee dealing with the
breach of the Rules, that hon Minister instructed his legal adviser to
apply for a recusal of hon members of this House on the grounds that they
were biased against him. He still has not apologised to them. That was done
in bad faith and he still has not apologised for that. [Interjections.] The
Minister only admitted to the Public Protector a year after he had made the
statements in Parliament that he realised that they were not true.

I want to ask whether we can afford to have a person occupying the senior
portfolio of Justice and Constitutional Development who is in violation of
the Constitution. [Interjections.] He has a major hand in selecting judges,
he regulates our courts, and he has enormous powers that affect the whole
of South Africa and all our people. If he has to be reminded of his
personal integrity, and if he cares so little about his constitutional
duty, how can this violator of the Constitution be the Minister of Justice
and Constitutional Development? [Interjections.]  [Applause.]

Mnu M A MZIZI: Somlomo, angibonge ukuthola leli thuba. Okokuqala
mangixolise ukuthi uzakwethu owayesimele kuleli komidi uPhrof Ndabandaba
akaphumelelanga ukuza namhlanje. Uthathwe umsebenzi ukuthi abe ngasePitoli
ngokwekomidi alisebenzelayo. Njengozakwethu ube-ke esenginxusa ukuthi
ngizozwakalisa ilaka ngokweqembu lethu.

Amalungu ezokhumbula ukuthi lolu daba lusuka le onyakeni ka-1996 lapho
uNgqongqoshe wezomThetho nokuThuthukiswa komThethosisekelo,
wayesenguNgqongqoshe wezimBiwa. Kumnandi ukukhuluma ngomunye umuntu kodwa
kubuhlungu uma sekukhulunywa ngawe. Ngiyethemba ukuthi ukhona otolikayo.
Amalungu ahloniphekile azokhumbula ukuthi uNgqongqoshe uPenuell Maduna
wayekhuluma kuyo le Ndlu yesiShayamthetho ngento eyayenzeka laphayana
kulowo mnyango ayewuphethe ngaleso sikhathi. Imali okwakukhulunywa ngayo
kwakuyizigidi zamaRandi eziyi-13. Kwasishaqisa sonke ukuzwa uma kwethulwa
leyo nkulumo yokuthi leyo mali yakhwabaniswa. Ekuhambeni kwesikhathi
kwatholakala ukuthi ngesikhathi uNgqongqoshe ethula leyo nkulumo, ucwaningo
nophenyo lwalusaqhubeka lungakaphothulwa. Kuyezwakala ukuthi ekugcineni
kuthe uma seluphothuliwe lolo daba uNgqongqoshe esenikezwa umbiko,
wahoxisa. Amagama ayeyizigwegwana wawasusa enkulumeni ayeyethulile.

Ngiyavuma nami ukuthi uma umuntu onile kuyaye kufuneke ukuthi ajeziswe.
Kodwa-ke uma umuntu onile bese eyihoxisa inkulumo ayenzile, kudingeke ngani
ukuthi ame esidlangaleni axolise? Mina ngokwami ukubona, umuntu uma
ehoxisile, inkulumo yakhe yokuhoxisa izwakala kakhulu kunokuba eme
esidlangaleni. Ngaphandle-ke kwabakholwayo bona okuye kube khona ukuyovuma,
lapho umuntu eya kuMfundisi ayoxolisa kuye, athi: Bengicela ungixolele.
[Ihlombe.]

Yinto lena eyenzeka esikhathini osekukudala sedlule. Esehoxisile
uNgqongqoshe, umVikeli womPhakathi naye wadonselwa esigcawini ukuthi
aphawule ngalolu daba. Waphawula kwatholakala izinto ezenzeka. Eseze
wahoxisa uNgqongqoshe, kwatholakala ukuthi iPhalamende nalo kufuneka libe
nekomidi lesikhashana elingase lilandele lolo daba olwalwethulwe ezithebeni
zalo. IPhalamende laba-ke nekomidi lesikhashana elaliholwa nguye uMnu Nel.
Sebengijikijela ngamatshe! Mawabe kahle lawo malungu ahloniphekile.
[Uhleko.]

UMnu Nel wathatha isikhathi, nebala. Sikhuluma lapha ngodaba oseluqede
unyaka noma ngaphezulu. Wazibeka izizathu ezadala ukuthi angakwenzi lokho
ngaleso sikhathi. Esinye sezincomo ezenziwe yilelo komidi elaliholwa nguMnu
Nel, ngukuthi ikomidi lelo alikwazi ukwenza izincomo ezingeza ePhalamende
zokuthi linxuse le Ndlu ukuthi mayidonse uNgqongqoshe uPenuel Maduna ukuze
azoxolisa, ngoba sewawahoxisa amagama ayewenzile. Okungenani banxusa ukuthi
lolu daba maluphindiselwe kumakomidi, kungaba ngelezezimali, elezimbiwa
namandla noma leli elibhekele izimali zomphakathi. Yibona-ke abangahlahla
indlela eya phambili ukuze kutholakale isixazululo uma ngabe kusekhona
okusilele. Kutholakele ukuthi ngokomthetho owabekwa yiNkantolo
yomThethosisekelo, leli Phalamende lingeke lijezise uNgqongqoshe noma
ilungu lale Ndlu. Asikubheke-ke lokhu, sikubuke kabili.

Yebo, siyazi bakhulumile ngelungu elihloniphekile uPatricia de Lille
ngodaba olwenzeka. Yebo, kwakushaqisa kona. Sonke sashaqeka ukuthi uma
eseze wahoxisa, yini kuze kuthiwe makube nekomidi futhi elizobheka udaba
lwakhe. Kowa lokho-ke sekwalungiswa. Ngabe siqonde ukuthi makuthi lelo
phutha esalenza laze layonqandwa yinkantolo yathi: hhayi phela
seniwedlulisile amandla enu, masibuye silenze futhi namanje, siphinde
siyotshelwa yinkantolo ukuthi sesonile futhi, senza obekungafanele
sikwenze?

Benginxusa, egameni le-IFP, ngokuthi: ``to err is human, peace is divine.''
Sonke siyawenza amaphutha, kepha ukuxolela kungokoMdali. (Translation of
Zulu speech follows.)

[Mr M A MZIZI: Madam Speaker, I would like to thank you for this
opportunity and to apologise for my colleague Prof Ndabandaba who is unable
to be here today. He is the one who usually represents us in this
committee. He is in Pretoria due to the work of the committee for which he
is working. As a colleague, he asked me to come here to express the view of
our party.

Hon members will remember the issue that arose in 1996 when the hon the
Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development was the Minister of
Minerals and Energy. It is nice to talk about a person, but it hurts when
people talk about one. I hope that my speech is being interpreted. Hon
members will remember when Minister Penuell Maduna spoke in this House
about something that happened in his department. The amount of money that
was being discussed was R30 million. Many of us were shocked to hear that
such an amount of money had been misappropriated. As time went on, it
became clear that the hon the Minister had announced that while the
investigation was still continuing. We were told that after the
investigation, the hon the Minister withdrew some of the words that he had
said. He withdrew irritating words that he had used in his speech.

I am of the opinion that once a person has transgressed, he should be
punished. What is the need to apologise in public when a person has already
withdrawn his words? As a far as I am concerned, when a person withdraws
his words, his speech when he withdraws his words sounds better that his
speech when he apologises in public. It is understandable for Christians,
as they are expected to apologise to the priest when they have sinned, by
saying: ``Father, please forgive me''. [Applause.]

This happened a long time ago. After the hon the Minister had apologised,
the Public Protector was called to the public interview and asked to
comment on this issue. In his comments he explained what had happened. When
the hon the Minister had withdrawn his words, Parliament was expected to
set up an interim committee that would follow up the matter. Then an
interim committee that was chaired by Mr Nel was set up. [Interjections.]
They are throwing stones at me! Those hon members must hold on. [Laughter.]

Mr Nel took time to respond. We are talking here about the issue that
lasted for one and a half year. One of the recommendations made by Mr Nel
and his committee, was that his committee could not ask Parliament to call
on Minister Maduna to withdraw his words, because he had already done so.
They then asked for the issue to be taken to three committees, the
Committees on Finance, Minerals and Energy and Public Accounts. They were
the ones who could provide a way forward so as to find a solution if there
was something still amiss. It was found that according to the law that was
passed by the Constitutional Court, this Parliament could not punish the
hon the Minister or any member of this House. Let us now look at these two
points.

Yes, we know, they talked about the hon Patricia de Lille regarding what
happened. It was shocking indeed. We were all shocked about why a committee
was set up when a man had already withdrawn his words. That issue has
already been rectified. Are we challenging the court which said: ``Oh, you
have overstepped the limits?'' Are we saying we should overstepped the
limits again? Do we want to be told by the court again that we have
transgressed by doing what we were not supposed to do?

In the name of the IFP, I would like to say: ``To err is human, to forgive
divine.'' We all make mistakes, however, to forgive is for God.]

Mr D M BAKKER: Madam Speaker, we are today debating a matter that should
actually never have been on the agenda of a democratic parliament. There
are two main reasons why I am saying this. In the first place one would not
have expected a Minister of state to falsely accuse a Chapter 9 institution
like the Auditor-General of cooking the books. Instead of resolving this
issue with the Auditor-General directly, or referring the matter to the
Standing Committee on Public Accounts, he resorted to a public forum -
Parliament - to air his views in this regard and to show his lack of
knowledge.

Even when the Minister knew he had been wrong, he still found reason to
speak in an uncomplimentary manner about the Auditor-General at a press
briefing two months later. Although the Minister was aware within days that
his claim was false, he preferred to enter into an unprecedented public
slanging match, and said that he could not be bothered to correct reports
and impressions. He said the media interpreted things in many weird ways
and he could not be bothered about what the media said.

According to him, his only sin in this bizarre conflict with the Auditor-
General was to ask very clumsy questions of the Auditor-General in
Parliament. The Public Protector found the conduct of the Minister to be
unacceptable and stated that even if the facts showed that the Auditor-
General's office had done something wrong, which the facts did not show,
the Minister should have used the proper channels and acted in a manner
which was procedurally correct.

The result of the Minister's failure to address his lack of knowledge
through the proper channels was an investigation by the Public Protector
that cost the taxpayer in excess of R30 million. If the Minister was a
director of any company in the world that took a R30 million loss because
of his absurd actions, he would have been fired. The question that needs to
be answered is whether a person that wastes more than R30 million of the
money of the taxpayers, who are the shareholders of the state, is suitable
for public office?

My second reason for saying that this debate should never have been on the
agenda of a democratic parliament is that one would have expected the hon
the President to have intervened long before this debate reached the agenda
of Parliament. A Cabinet Minister is appointed by the President and can
only be dismissed by the President, but must act in accordance with the
Constitution.

When a Chapter 9 institution then finds, as the Public Protector has done,
that a Minister violated the spirit of the Constitution by not upholding
its principles and prescripts, one would have expected in a constitutional
state that the hon the President, who is responsible, as head of state in
terms of the Constitution, for upholding, defending and respecting the
Constitution, would act against the Minister who violated the spirit of our
Constitution.

In plaas daarvan dat daar teen die Minister opgetree is, is hy bevorder tot
die sleutelposisie van Minister van Justisie en Grondwetlike Ontwikkeling.
In hierdie posisie is hy nou die politieke hoof van die regstelsel van ons
land. Dié amp vereis dat hy bo agterdog verhewe moet wees, ook deursigtig
moet wees en berekend moet optree. Die agb Minister skiet, wat al drie
hierdie vereistes betref, ver te kort, en hy het dit weer eens verlede jaar
bevestig met sy ongevraagde, skandalige aanval in die Parlement op die agb
Dene Smuts oor seks oor die kleurgrens. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Sekerlik as 'n direkte gevolg van die feit dat die agb Minister Maduna
wegkom met hierdie tipe afbrekende uitlatings, sien ons nou hoe sy groot
vriend, die agb Minister van Veiligheid en Sekuriteit, in sy voetspore volg
met totaal afkeurenswaardige uitlatings oor die Portugese gemeenskap en oor
vroue. Die vraag is: Wat is volgende?

Ons agb President verkondig wêreldwyd 'n Afrika-renaissance, wat hy beskou
as dié uitdaging van ons tyd, en hieroor sê hy op 5 Oktober 2000 in Accra,
en ek haal aan:


  Of critical importance is that we should have a leadership that is
  committed to defending the interests of our people, a leadership that has
  turned its back from corrupt practices and abuse of power for self-
  interest. We have at all times to demonstrate deep levels of seriousness
  and urgency in all we do, and avoid the casual approach and a belief that
  things will happen on their own.

Met lighartige en belaglike aanhalings soos dié van die agb Ministers
Maduna en Tshwete, in skrille kontras met die President se woorde, sal
niemand ooit die ernstige aard en dringendheid van die uitdagings van ons
tyd verstaan nie. Die ANC beskuldig gereeld die opposisie dat ons nie
patrioties is nie en dat die beeld van Suid-Afrika wat ons uitdra nie
positief genoeg is nie. Watter beeld dra 'n agb Minister uit deur die gees
van ons Grondwet te verkrag? Wat kan die opposisie doen wat erger is as
dít? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Instead of action being taken against the Minister, he was promoted to the
key position of Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development. In this
position he is now the political head of the legal system of our country.
This position requires that he be above suspicion, and also that he be
transparent and act in a calculating manner. The hon the Minister is sadly
lacking in respect of all three of these requirements, and he proved this
once again last year with his uncalled-for, scandalous attack in Parliament
on the hon Dene Smuts about sex across the colour line. [Interjections.]

Surely as a direct result of the fact that the hon Minister Maduna gets
away with this type of destructive remark, we now see his dear friend, the
hon the Minister of Safety and Security, following in his footsteps with
totally reprehensible remarks about the Portuguese community and about
women. The question is: What next?

The hon the President is proclaiming, throughout the world, an African
Renaissance, which he regards as the challenge of our time, and about which
he said the following on 5 October 2000 in Accra, and I quote:


  Of critical importance is that we should have a leadership that is
  committed to defending the interests of our people, a leadership that has
  turned its back from corrupt practices and abuse of power for self-
  interest. We have at all times to demonstrate deep levels of seriousness
  and urgency in all we do, and avoid the casual approach and a belief that
  things will happen on their own.
With lighthearted and ridiculous quotations such as those of the hon
Ministers Maduna and Tshwete, in stark contrast to the President's words,
no one will ever comprehend the serious nature and urgency of the
challenges of our time. The ANC regularly accuses the opposition of not
being patriotic, and claims that the image of South Africa that we convey
is not positive enough. What image is an hon Minister conveying by
violating the spirit of our Constitution? What can the opposition do that
is worse than this?]

It is not necessary for me to repeat how the hon the Minister violated the
Constitution. The Public Protector has proved that in an excellent manner
in his comprehensive report. What is, however, absolutely remarkable about
the Public Protector's report, is that it goes beyond his terms of
reference, adopted by the National Assembly, to report on whether the
reports of the Auditor-General were correct and proper. Whilst answering
this request by the National Assembly, the Public Protector felt duty-
bound, obviously because of the excessive conduct of the Minister in his
attack on the Auditor-General, to recommend that Parliament make a
pronouncement regarding the accountability of the Minister and any possible
sanction that Parliament might consider appropriate. The Public Protector,
having full regard to the fact that the Minister had already been found
guilty of transgressing Rule 99 of the Standing Rules of Parliament, found
that the violation of the spirit of the Constitution by the Minister was so
serious that he regarded it proper for Parliament to act thereon.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Where is the Minister? [Interjections.]

Mr D M BAKKER: One would have expected Parliament to regard the request of
a Chapter 9 institution seriously and to deal with this request in a proper
manner. Instead, we ended up with an ANC-dominated committee, the so-called
Nel Committee, or as the hon Jannie Momberg referred to it, the ``the ANC's
Protected Generals Committee'', which went out of its way to find excuses
to exonerate the hon the Minister. [Interjections.] In other words, the
ANC's own protected generals committee, headed by the ANC's own protected
general, Andries Nel, has found a way to protect the ANC's own Minister,
and it does not matter what damage he caused. [Interjections.]

The New NP and the DA did not support this report. We are left with the
feeling that the Public Protector's time and effort were wasted and his
proposals ridiculed. The voting cattle of the ANC adhered to ``his master's
voice''. [Applause.]

Adv S P HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, hon members, if the people of South Africa
were dependent entirely on press reports and the utterances of the
opposition for information relating to the work of this Parliament and
Government, they would be a most ignorant and ill-informed public.
[Applause.]

The truth and the facts are not allowed to stand in the way of sensational
stories and clever political sound bites. This distortion of the true
purpose of the work of this ad hoc committee and of the mandate given by
Parliament to the Public Protector has been so sustained and deliberate
that it would not be surprising if some of the hon members of this House
thought that investigations conducted by the two bodies were on how
Minister Maduna should be punished for his statements relating to the then
Auditor-General. Fortunately, the public has the ANC at its disposal to
give it the correct information.

The truth of the matter is that the investigations were not about Minister
Maduna, but about the allegations of irregularities in the affairs and
financial statements of the Strategic Fuel Fund Association and the Central
Energy Fund. These facts are all, of course, contained in the report we are
presenting to the House.

The confusion surrounding Minister Maduna's role in the whole matter
emanates from the Public Protector's concern for the protection of the
dignity of what are called ``Chapter 9 institutions'' such as the
commissions and the offices of the Auditor-General and the Public
Protector. He used his prerogative and went beyond the National Assembly's
terms of reference to examine the question of whether or not the Minister
had violated the Constitution by questioning the Auditor-General's motive
with regard to the so-called accounting loss amounting to the sum of R170
million.

As is by now well known, the Public Protector found that the Minister had
violated the spirit of the Constitution, more so when it turned out that
the loss of the sum in question was not a physical loss, but an accounting
loss occasioned by an undisclosed change in accounting policy. The Public
Protector went on to recommend that some form of censure be applied against
Minister Maduna. Believing that a mere apology on the part of the Minister
would not be enough, he nonethelesss failed to suggest the form which such
censure should take, due, inter alia, to the fact that he knew that the law
permitted for no such censure in the circumstances.

Hon members will recall that this House had set up a committee to consider
the implications of the Minister's statement when he first questioned the
motives of the Auditor-General. That committee reported to the National
Assembly that the Minister's remarks were unparliamentary. The Speaker duly
called upon him to apologise and to withdraw the remarks. The Minister
rose, tendered his apology and unreservedly withdrew the offending remarks.
In the view of the House, the Speaker, and significantly, the hon Gibson of
the DP, that was the end of the matter: Minister Maduna had been properly
censured by the National Assembly.

Now a reading of the Public Protector's report reveals that the Public
Protector made a material error in that, whilst he accepted that the
Minister had apologised, he thought that he had not retracted the remarks
that were found to be unparliamentary. We can thus surmise that the reason
the Public Protector suggested that something more than an apology be
considered was his misapprehension that the remarks remained unretracted.
The Public Protector nevertheless found that the Minister was, at all
times, acting in good faith as he had no personal gripe with the Auditor-
General.

In the course of performing the task that he was called upon to perform,
the Public Protector did establish that, indeed, there were irregularities
relating to the manner in which the affairs and financial statements of the
SFF Association were conducted. He went on to suggest certain ways by which
these irregularities could be avoided in future. We support his
recommendations in this regard.

We have had to deal with the extraneous matter of what to do with regard to
the violation of the spirit of the Constitution by the Minister, a matter
which had been finalised by this House, as has been pointed out before. The
Public Protector himself points out that there are no legal provisions,
either in statutory law or in the Constitution, for the types of sanctions
to be applied in the event of a violation of the relevant sections of the
Constitution in the matter at hand.

Whilst we agree with him in this respect, we however do not share his view
that this constitutes a weakness in the Constitution. We could not have
expected the Constitution itself to provide for more than it does - that is
a matter for other pieces of legislation that will ensure mutual respect
and support for all organs of state. The ANC, accordingly, supports the ad
hoc committee's recommendation that the matter of the absence of legal
sanctions be referred to the Portfolio Committee on Justice and
Constitutional Development for consideration and report, and for submission
to the Constitutional Review Committee.

The components of the Democratic Alliance in this House and the hon De
Lille of the PAC, with the help of some sections of the press, have been
baying for Minister Maduna's blood, saying that he be variously brought
before the ad hoc committee to answer for his conduct, pay a fine of
R10 000, be hauled before the Speaker in the National Assembly for a
reprimand or be dismissed from Cabinet. This is mischievous in the extreme.
[Interjections.]

First of all, as we have said repeatedly, Minister Maduna was duly censured
in terms of the Rules of this House, and he was called upon to apologise
and to retract the offending remarks. Secondly, and most importantly, the
ad hoc committee was not constituted as a disciplinary committee which
could have entertained the fantastic ideas of our opponents.

Even if we had been mandated to discipline Minister Maduna, we could not
have done more than what the first committee did, which was to call on the
Minister to apologise and to withdraw his remarks. As Parliament, we are
powerless to do more than that, and as the ANC, we respect the courts of
the land and the Constitution.

In the matter of The Speaker of the National Assembly vs De Lille and
Another, the Supreme Court of Appeal judgment by the late Chief Justice
Mahomed states that anything not authorised by law cannot be considered
valid, and anyone whose rights are violated by such conduct is entitled to
the protection of the courts. This case, as hon members know, dealt with
the matter of the suspension of the hon De Lille by this House after she
had apologised for and withdrawn unsubstantiated allegations against
members of this House. The circumstances of the present case fall within
the ambit of the reasoning behind the judgment. This is the case,
regardless of how much the hon De Lille screams and raves to the contrary.

The late Chief Justice Mahomed said, and I quote:


  No Parliament, however bona fide or eminent its membership, no President,
  however formidable be his reputation or scholarship, and no official,
  however efficient or well-meaning, can make any law or perform any act
  which is not sanctioned by the Constitution.

In addition to these words, we maintain that no member of the opposition,
however vocal or cantankerous, however much he or she dislikes Minister
Maduna or the ANC, and no newspaper articles, however venomous their
attacks or wide their circulation, will sway the ANC from its commitment to
the rule of law, fair play and the transformation of the land for the
benefit of all its people. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

In conclusion, I wish to commend Comrade Andries Nel for the able manner in
which he presided over the proceedings of the committee. [Laughter.]
[Applause.] He even managed to keep the DP in check, and gave it no room to
run away or walk out ... [Laughter] [Applause.] ... as it is wont to do
when it cannot get its way. Madam Speaker, we commend this report to you
and this hon House. [Applause.]

Mr M E MABETA: Madam Speaker, hon members of Parliament and members of the
public here, we are participating in this debate today mindful of the fact
that ordinary South Africans who have sent us to this Parliament are
intensely interested in a number of questions central to this debate. For
example, what is the political role and responsibility of our Cabinet
Ministers in the transformation of our country?

What is the nature of the Strategic Fuel Fund in terms of this
transformation? What is the history of the SFF when we look at these
matters? What is the departmental accountability that this responsibility
entails and what is the desirable tension and balance between that
political responsibility and constitutional guidelines for the actions of
Cabinet Ministers?

Were the Minister's remarks about the institution itself or the end result
of the functions of the Auditor-General? Would it be an abdication of duty
if the Minister had kept silent with regard to the R170 million and the
SFF's activities? Would the Constitutional Court be of the view that the
Minister had compromised the integrity of these institutions?

What exactly is the spirit of section 181 of the Constitution? Are Chapter
9 institutions above the law? What are the implications of the Public
Protector's remarks on page 148, paragraphs (d),(f) and (g)? These are
nonpartisan considerations that interest ordinary South African men and
women and they do not need the press to decipher or explain these issues to
them.

The UDM takes note of the fact that the Public Protector's findings and
recommendations with respect to Minister Maduna's statements against the
Auditor-General took into account the Minister's apology with regard to
breaching Parliament's Rule 99, now Rule 66. We also take note of the
Public Protector's conclusion that the Minister's remarks violated sections
181 and 41 of the Constitution, which require all spheres and organs of
state within its sphere not only to co-operate but to do so in a manner
that respects all mutual constitutional obligations towards each other.

The absence of any specified sanctions for the transgressions of sections
181 and 41 in our Constitution does not relieve members of the Cabinet from
their collective or individual accountability, and therefore Parliament, in
our view, must make a pronouncement regarding the accountability of the
Minister and any possible censure.

We strongly believe that the R30 million legal costs incurred by taxpayers
as a result of the Minister's ill-timed and misplaced statements must be
seen against the background of irregularities and mismanagement in the
Ministry that go beyond 1994. We reject the majority party's view that
Parliament is powerless to do anything about the conduct and statements
made by members of Government in violation of our Constitution, but we
fully support the recommendation made by the Public Protector, especially
the conclusion that Parliament must make a pronouncement. [Interjections.]

I would like, in conclusion, to state that it would be advisable if in
future the Minister would not make bold statements on matters which have
not been conclusively proved. The spirit of corporate governance compels
the executive to take heed of certain constitutional requirements, but
because we have the separation of powers, the matter of the Minister
concerned must be raised with the executive which, if it fails to take
action, may refer the matter to the Constitutional Court. [Interjections.]

Parliament must pass a motion raising concern. We cannot allow this
institution to emasculate itself and divest itself of its mandate simply
because the executive wishes us to do so in disregard of the will of the
people to whom it is accountable. There is no doubt that the manner in
which the Public Protector's report was written has raised a number of
questions which Parliament has not been able to clarify or successfully
address.

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, hon Ministers and members, the ACDP is in full
agreement with the minority position on the report that the ad hoc
committee has failed in its recommendations to keep the Minister
appropriately accountable to the public. [Interjections.]
Our Constitution is explicit about recognising our public organs as
national assets that are constitutionally protected. Our Constitution
ensures that no more will the South African nation be subjected to
authoritarian rule. Our people now have recourse to public institutions -
Chapter 9 institutions - to protect their rights and freedoms. The Public
Protector is the people's instrument to hold Parliament accountable for its
conduct and for the rules and laws it makes. We as public representatives
must be held accountable for our actions.

The ACDP commends the Public Protector for the great contribution he has
made to our country's democracy. Members in this House ought to remember
that we are all democratically elected representatives. This principle does
not cease once elections are over. All committees, even ad hoc committees,
operate under the discipline of our constitutional democracy. Unfortunately
the ad hoc committee, in this instance, has not accurately adopted the
correct approach, as recommended by the Public Protector.

The ACDP supports the principle of accountability that underscores the
recommendation of the Public Protector with regard to the Minister's
unconstitutional behaviour. It recommends that the legislature bring the
Minister to order for his unconstitutional conduct against the office of
the Auditor-General.

The ACDP accepts that the Minister has apologised and retracted his remarks
in this House, and we commend him for this. [Interjections.] [Applause.]
However, his actions cost the taxpayer R30 million, which could have been
used much more productively, and an apology is therefore needed to the
public for wasting taxpayer's money.

Dr C P MULDER: Mev die Speaker, ek wou vanmiddag begin het deur die agb
Minister geluk te wens met sy teenwoordigheid, dat hy die moed aan die dag
lê om die debat by te woon. Dit is jammer dat hy tans nie meer in die Raad
is nie, as ek reg kyk. Ek dink dit sou verstandig gewees het om óf die hele
debat by te woon, óf die hele debat glad nie by te woon nie. Dit is jammer
dat hy moes gaan.

Die gebeure wat ons vandag debatteer, het hul oorsprong gehad in die
Vraetyd in die Parlement. Dit het gegaan oor die Minister se bewerings dat
'n moontlike verlies van R170 miljoen aangeteken is. Die probleem het
verder ontstaan deurdat die Minister sekere aantygings sou gemaak het van
die beweerde bedekking van hierdie verlies van R170 miljoen deur die
destydse Ouditeur-generaal, mnr Henri Kluever.

Nou ontstaan die vraag onmiddellik: hoekom het die Minister op daardie dag
hierdie aantygings in die Raad gemaak? Agb lede sal onthou, as hulle
terugdink aan daardie Vraetyd, dat die Minister op sy stukke was. Op
Afrikaans sou ons sê hy was daardie dag 'n ramkat. Hy het gegaan vir die
Ouditeur-generaal.

Hoekom het die agb Minister dit gedoen? U sal onthou dat in die weke
gedurende die aanloop tot hierdie gebeure die Ouditeur-generaal verskeie
verslae uitgebring het, waarin hy, om dit sagkens te stel, beweer het dit
sou sleg wees vir die ANC-regering as dit aan die lig kom. Minister Maduna
wou op daardie dag terugkap na die Ouditeur-generaal, want laasgenoemde was
immers nog 'n aanstelling uit die vorige bedeling. Daarom het hy voluit
gegaan vir die Ouditeur-generaal daardie dag.

Dit is net hier waar die agb Minister se oordeel hom in die steek gelaat
het, want toe gaan hy vir mnr Kluever. Dit het gelei tot die besluit van
die Nasionale Vergadering op 21 Augustus 1997, wat onder andere die opdrag
gegee het dat die beweerde onreëlmatighede met betrekking tot die state van
finansiële instellings verder ondersoek moes word. Die klem van daardie
hele opdrag was egter gemik op die Ouditeur-generaal, en nie op die
Minister nie.

Wat die ANC egter in hierdie proses nie kon voorsien nie, toe hulle as die
meerderheid daardie dag die besluit in die Raad geneem het om hierdie
ondersoek te laat plaasvind, was die inhoud van die verslag van die
Openbare Beskermer. Hy het bevind dat die Minister strydig met die gees van
die Grondwet opgetree het, en dit so ernstig geag het dat hy gesê het 'n
blote apologie sou nie voldoende wees nie.

My probleem met die ANC, en ek het dit vandag weer gesien, is dat daar
telkens geleenthede is waar die ANC 'n keuse moet maak tussen wat reg is en
wat nie noodwendig reg is nie en wat verkeerd is, en telkens word die keuse
verkeerd uitgeoefen. Ná die besetting van die plase in Zimbabwe is ook die
verkeerde opsie uitgeoefen. Met die wapentransaksie en die betrokkenheid
van regter Heath en sy eenheid, is ook die verkeerde opsie uitgeoefen. Met
die uitlatings oor die effektiwiteit van die druk op die Zimbabwese regbank
het die ANC weer eens die verkeerde opsie uitgeoefen.

Vandag gaan die ANC heen en oefen weer eens die verkeerde opsie uit deur
die agb Minister te beskerm. Hierdie agb Minister - en ek is jammer hy is
nie vandag in die Raad nie - word myns insiens binne die ANC geoormerk vir
groter dinge op die pad vorentoe. Hy skep egter die indruk dat hy aanmekaar
omstrede is en dergelike situasies is nie tot sy voordeel nie. In sy
afwesigheid wil ek aan die agb Minister sê: ``If you stay out there long
enough, there is no place to hide''. [As 'n mens lank genoeg daar buite
bly, dan is daar later nêrens oor om weg te kruip nie.] Ek is van mening
dat die agb Minister tans reeds by daardie punt verby is. Ons sal die
verslag nie steun nie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, I wanted to start this afternoon by
congratulating the hon the Minister on his presence, for having the courage
to attend the debate. It is a pity that he is now no longer in the House,
if my eyes are not deceiving me. I think it would have been sensible either
to attend the whole debate or not attend the debate at all. It is a pity
that he had to leave.

The events that we are debating here this afternoon had their origin during
Question Time in Parliament. They concerned the Minister's allegations that
there had been a possible loss of R170 million. The problem further arose
because the Minister made certain allegations to the effect that the then
Auditor-General, Mr Henri Kluever, had concealed this loss of R170 million.

The question immediately arises: Why did the Minister make those
allegations in the House on that day? Hon members will recall, when they
cast their minds back to that Question Time, that the Minister was in great
form. In Afrikaans one could say he was ``'n ramkat'' [faring extremely
well]. He went for the Auditor-General.

Why did the hon the Minister do that? Hon members will remember that in the
weeks leading up to these events the Auditor-General published several
reports, in which, to put it mildly, he alleged that it would be
undesirable for the ANC Government if their contents were to become public
knowledge. On that day Minister Maduna wanted to hit back at the Auditor-
General, because the latter was, after all, still an appointment from the
previous dispensation. That is why he went all out for the Auditor-General
that day.

It is right here that the hon the Minister's judgment left him in the
lurch, because he went for Mr Kluever. This led to the decision on 21
August 1997 by the National Assembly, which, inter alia, issued the
instruction that the alleged irregularities relating to the statements of
financial institutions should be further investigated. The emphasis of that
whole instruction was aimed at the Auditor-General, however, and not the
Minister.

What the ANC could not, however, foresee in this entire process, when they,
as the majority, took the decision in the House that day to allow this
investigation to take place, was the content of the report of the Public
Protector. He found that the Minister had acted contrary to the spirit of
the Constitution, and deemed this to be so serious that he said a mere
apology would be insufficient.

My problem with the ANC, and I saw this again today, is that time and again
there are occasions when the ANC must choose between what is right and what
is not necessarily right and what is wrong, and time and again the wrong
choice is made. After the occupation of farms in Zimbabwe the wrong option
was also chosen. With the arms transaction and the involvement of Judge
Heath and his unit once again the wrong option was chosen. With the
comments concerning the effectiveness of the pressure on the judiciary of
Zimbabwe, the ANC once again chose the wrong option.

Today the ANC went ahead and once again made the wrong choice by protecting
the hon the Minister. This hon Minister - and I regret that he is not in
the House today - has in my view been identified for greater things within
the ANC on the road ahead. He creates the impression, however, that he is
constantly controversial and such situations are not to his advantage. In
his absence I want to say to the Minister: ``If you stay out there long
enough, there is no place to hide.'' I am of the view that the hon the
Minister has already gone beyond that point. We shall not support the
report.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members, it is very important that
this matter be laid to rest once and for all. It has taken rather too long
and has surely sapped the energy of those affected. We in the UCDP maintain
that the findings and recommendations of the Public Protector have to be
upheld.

There is no doubt that the hon the Minister erred, as he has accepted, in
expressing himself as he did when referring to an incumbent of a Chapter 9
institution, namely the Auditor-General. We accept that there is freedom of
speech for members of Parliament. We also accept that there are limitations
to all rights, and we maintain that the Minister should have known better
than to say what he said. The Constitution states clearly in section
181(4), and I quote:


  No person or organ of state may interfere with the functioning of these
  institutions.

We maintain that an example has to be set in order to deter others from
following such untoward conduct.

The whole exercise is exacerbated by the fact that the issue involves a
Minister of state, who swore or affirmed that he undertook to hold office
as Minister with honour and dignity. We maintain that the manner in which
the hon the Minister handled this issue under discussion was far from being
honourable, let alone dignified.

Section 2(a)(i) of the Executive Members' Ethics Act of 1998 stipulates
that Cabinet Ministers should, at all times, act in the best interest of
good governance and that it is expected of them not to act in a way that
may compromise the credibility or integrity of their office or of
Government. The hon the Minister has unfortunately not been able to live up
to these requirements.

We may boast of having the most progressive Constitution under the sun and
the best legislation this side of the Atlantic. But if we do not act in
accordance with those legislative instruments, they are not worth the
papers they are written on. [Interjections.]

Someone has to take responsibility for the man-hours and the money invested
in this uncalled-for exercise. The investigation by the Public Protector
and the briefings of counsel for both the hon the Minister and the Auditor-
General have cost the taxpayer millions of rands. This is a clear-cut
unnecessary expense which could have been avoided.

While we accept that the hon the Minister did apologise and retract his
words, we in the UCDP feel that it would not be unreasonable to call on him
to reimburse the costs of the exercise even if it were a fraction thereof.
[Applause]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, section 181(4) of the Constitution provides
that no organ of state shall interfere with Chapter 9 institutions, and the
Auditor-General is one of these institutions. Mr Maduna has clearly
violated this provision and the Public Protector duly found him guilty.

The Public Protector did the correct thing by referring this matter to a
parliamentary committee, because Ministers are both individually and
collectively accountable and responsible to Parliament for their actions in
terms of section 92(2) of the Constitution. Section 92(3) also compels
Ministers and Cabinet to act in accordance with the Constitution.

Against this background, and in terms of section 83(b) of the Constitution,
which states that the President must uphold, defend and respect the
Constitution, it is incumbent upon the President to discipline Mr Maduna
for having violated the Constitution in the most unsophisticated manner.
[Interjections.] We therefore call on President Mbeki to discipline Mr
Maduna or accept collective responsibility for Mr Maduna's actions.

To compare Mr Maduna's case with the De Lille judgment is factually wrong.
[Interjections.] There is a clear distinction. A Minister violated the
Constitution, I did not. I am proud that I fought for certain rights in the
Constitution and that my case did not cost the taxpayer millions of rands.
But in the Minister's case: What a waste of money!

The hon the Minister must acknowledge his mistake and apologise. The hon
the Minister must be reprimanded the way two other ANC members of
Parliament were reprimanded in this House. This is to prevent the
Constitution being further violated.

In conclusion, in the light of what the ANC has done, I am seriously
considering naming other spies and seeing what action Madam Speaker will
take against me. If it means kicking me out of the House, the hon the
Speaker will not get it right. [Applause.]

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, when the leadership of the ANC went into
exile during the 1960s, they became very involved establishing relations
with international communities and developing the fourth pillar of the
struggle, which was lobbying for sanctions to be imposed against the
apartheid regime. In 1960, African leaders met and considered, among other
things, the situation of South Africa. They established the Organisation of
African Unity in May 1963 and by 1964 they had endorsed sanctions against
South Africa.

In 1977, after the student massacres of 1976, the OAU structures, co-
operating with oil producing and exporting countries - which included
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, while Iran remained out of the picture and
supplied oil to South Africa - and workers from around the world, including
those from Trinidad, Tobago, Libya and Britain, as well as Shell workers,
exposed and put pressure on South Africa by refusing to handle any cargo
whose owners had had interaction with South Africa. In other words
sanctions were not only biting the South African economy, but were also
hurting those who were busting these sanctions.

Oliver Tambo, the then president of the ANC, received the endorsement from
Maritime Unions Against Apartheid to take action on the boycotts and on the
enforcement of the oil embargo. The go-slows, boycotts and exposures cost
millions of dollars. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General of the United
Nations, and Salim Achmad Salim, then the President of the General
Assembly, supported the anti-apartheid movement.

The South African economy relied heavily on oil. Pretoria had to provide
incentives to sanction busters. The Strategic Fuel Fund Association was
established in 1964, among other things, to covertly supply services and
goods for the regime. By 1975 the SFF was stockpiling crude oil as a main
task. By 1981 it was a main buyer of oil for strategic purposes.

This is to illustrate that the issue around the SFF is not an issue that is
about Maduna. It is about us focusing on the real problems that are
happening in that institution. The strategy around 1977 onwards was
synonymous with secrecy. The Central Energy Fund Act of 1977 was followed
up by a string of amendments which made it progressively more difficult for
the public to know anything about the location, quantity, quality, sales or
of who the buyers of this oil were. These Acts remained firmly in place
until the UN lifted the oil embargo in 1993. This was only repealed by this
Parliament in 1994.

When the Auditor-General then submitted his 1992-93 report on the SFF, he
was satisfied that he had done his job. The provisions of the Petroleum
Products Act were in place. The Auditor-General could provide a limited
report after consulting with the State President, the Minister of Minerals
and Energy and the Minister of Finance. So powerful were these provisions
that the SFF had not been audited for three years and no one was asking any
questions. They were too afraid to ask questions because when Jaap Marais
had dared to ask about oil being sold to Zimbabwe, he was charged.

The problem was that time was moving on and South Africa had been involved
in a number of scandals: there was the ``sniffer'' plane scandal and Salam
oil fraud. Therefore, one has to put oneself into the mind of Minister
Maduna, who walked into the Minerals and Energy portfolio.

The elections of 1994 did not change attitudes and habits. In fact, when
the Minister was instructed by the Presidency to investigate the contracts
of payments by the SFF to the Egyptians, there was a feeling that Maduna
was rousing sleeping dogs. It was not surprising because even as the
Minister was digging and finding out about the 6c per barrel which a
character called Abdelnour was getting - the Minister cancelled that
contract - he could not even take the matter further. Why did he not take
the matter further if contractually he was right and if there was nothing
wrong with the payments he was getting? Or was it that Minister Maduna was
getting too close to the bone for the comfort of some people?
[Interjections.]

Mr Maduna then questioned the R170 million which was reflected as a loss.
He was informed that it was merely a change in the accounting procedures
and that no money had been lost. He became puzzled. Please remember that
accounting procedures have never been the SFF's strong point. In 1979, Fred
Soudan, a chancer from America, had actually come to South Africa and
hoodwinked the same SFF into giving him US$12,3 million with which to buy a
tanker. That tanker was used to steal Shell oil. So, what are we dealing
with here? We are dealing with a Minister who comes into a portfolio which
has a reputation of not accounting to anybody, a portfolio which has been
historically protected by a barrage of laws. [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: What about Emmanuel Shaw III?

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, that is precisely why the Public Protector's
report is correct in also pointing out that it was not just the hon Maduna
who was the issue here. The Public Protector's report also refers to the
problems in the SFF. Those problems are historical and continuing, and we
want to ask the Portfolio Committee on Minerals and Energy to look,
firstly, into the accounting procedures of the SFF, communications that are
happening within the SFF because, yes, Mr Gibson is right that the problems
are continuing in the SFF. The problems are not that the hon Maduna has
left that portfolio, but that they are continuing and therefore merit
observation and investigation by this Parliament.

I wish to tell Mr Douglas Gibson that we have to go back to a South Africa
that was then using oil, amongst other things, to harass her neighbours. He
has to remember a situation where Lesotho, which is landlocked, organises
an oil packages for itself and South Africa blocks it and takes it.
Therefore, there is no way that we can sit here and actually mislead one
another that everything was fine; that we do not have to worry about the
conditions which are obtaining in the SFF because they are obtaining. I
want to submit that if they were not continuing, the strategic reserves
would not have been sold without consultation taking place.

I do not know, but when I was listening to members, they were telling us
that the ANC has refused to do what they were instructed to do by the
Public Protector. I do not understand it to be instructing Parliament to do
anything. I understand that report to be quite comprehensive. I do not
think that the public of South Africa want to elect people who will come
here and be instructed to do things, and not use their brains correctly.
[Applause.]

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mevrou die Speaker, vandag spreek ons nie die volk toe
nie. Hierdie verslag handel oor die verteenwoordigers van die volk en
spreek hulle vandag aan. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, today we are not addressing the nation.
This report deals with the representatives of the nation and we are dealing
with them today.]

When we as members of Parliament enter this Chamber to serve the nation, we
take an oath to uphold the Constitution, the supreme law of the land. We
promise the nation that we will respect the institution of Parliament and
those state institutions mentioned in Chapter 9 of the Constitution which
must strengthen constitutional democracy. To serve here is an honour
bestowed on us by the whole nation, not only by our support base. Our
decisions and utterances must at all times reflect the regard we have for
that trust which the nation placed in us.

From time to time we as members of Parliament will be required to stand
firm even against our own Government and our own Ministers and tell them
that they have breached the promise to respect the Constitution and the
institutions of Parliament. [Interjections.] It is sad when that happens.
The last time it happened it started the downfall of the previous
government.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Where were you?

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Those of us who experienced the debate following the
Erasmus Commission's report ... [Interjections.] The Minister should
listen! Those of us who experienced the debate following the Erasmus
Commission's report will concede that it brought shame to Parliament ...

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: But where were you?

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ ... and led to the expulsion of a Minister who lied to
Parliament ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order, hon member! On what point are you rising,
hon member?

Mr D M GUMEDE: Madam Speaker, is the hon member prepared to take a
question, and if so ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are you prepared to take a question, hon member?

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: At the end of my speech.
Mr D M GUMEDE: Okay, I will do so.

Mr P J I BLANCHÉ: It also ended the career of Prime Minister Vorster.
[Interjections.] We now have a more democratic Constitution to uphold.
[Interjections.] The Minister should listen carefully because he has to
uphold the Constitution. I sincerely hope that the ANC can live up to what
they themselves have referred to as ``the will of the people''.

The ANC has in the last months been tested on more than one occasion. On 5
December a large section of their supporters refused to vote for them.
[Interjections.] The report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts
and the ejection of hon member Feinstein as the Majority Party's spokesman
for Scopa added to the Government letting down the people's Parliament.
[Interjections.]

The ANC helped to establish this democratic Parliament. Let us hope that
their members will reject the interference from Government members in their
domain - the people's Parliament. If interference in parliamentary
committees is going to continue, then ANC members who have the support of
the majority of the nation will have less to say in the affairs of the
Government than hon member Cassie Aucamp, and this would be of their own
doing. They will have proved that collectively they have less guts than hon
member Patricia de Lille who all by herself had to prove to the nation that
she would not bow down to dictators. [Interjections.]

The facts of this report clearly show that a Minister has overstepped the
mark ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! Your speaking time has expired, hon
member.

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: ... and has tarnished the image of the Auditor-General's
Office. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Your time has expired, hon member.
[Interjections.] Order! Order! Hon member, your speaking time has expired.
You may leave the podium. [Interjections.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, I have a question to answer ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Your time has expired, hon member. Will you
please leave the podium. [Interjections.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Has that speaker not addressed ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, leave the podium. [Interjections.]
Order! On what point are you rising, hon member?

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The hon member
sitting there next to Mr Randall van den Heever, the gentleman with a light-
coloured jacket, used a word that I am not prepared to use in this House on
television. He swore across the floor, and I ask you to ask him to withdraw
and apologise. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, would you like to withdraw anything
that you said? I did not hear anything, and I can only depend on you to
enlighten the House.

Mr P M MATHEBE: Madam Speaker, I said that he was a new member, so what
does he know? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, not having heard the hon member, I am not
in a position ...

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, could I address you on this point of order?
The hon member is not telling the truth. The hon member used the f-word. He
said that that hon member knows, and then he used the f-word. I suggest it
is unparliamentary and he should withdraw that. [Interjections.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker, I wish to confirm that the word was used.

Mr P M MATHEBE: Madam Speaker, I withdraw.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the MF wants to place on record that the
economy and the citizens are the true victims of corruption and fraud which
is conducted in the private sectors and Government institutions. Corruption
in South Africa is an epidemic reality which necessitates the Government to
strictly implement available control measures to promote the message that
crime does not pay.

The investigation conducted by the Public Protector on the alleged
irregularities with regard to the affairs and financial statements of the
Strategic Fuel Fund Association, and on the relevant reports of the Auditor-
General to Parliament, in essence indicates that in order to combat
suspicions and actual occurrence of maladministration, all stakeholders
must communicate effectively to sustain transparency at all levels in the
institution. Stakeholders include the Minister, directors, board members,
auditors and staff at all levels in the institution. Furthermore,
stakeholders must exercise their specific skills with diligence and
caution, within their prescribed authority, to safeguard a company's
assets.

The MF agrees with the Public Protector's recommendation that all state
institutions should establish a formalised fraud strategy to identify,
assess, control, prevent and to respond to detected fraud. International
experience and expertise must be used to structure this fraud strategy.

On the issue of the Minister infringing the honour and integrity of the
Auditor-General, evidence indicates that he did withdraw his statement and
apologise. The Rules and orders of this Assembly do not provide
constitutional authority to discipline any member for this particular
purpose. The Constitution is the supreme law and not Parliament, and
therefore to determine the accountability of the Minister and the
implementation of the appropriate sanction, the MF concurs with the
committee's recommendation that these matters be referred to the Rules
Committee of the National Assembly to consider amendments to the Rules of
the National Assembly and the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act.
[Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I am still puzzled, trying to find out whether
Mr Blanché paid me a compliment or not. As was the case in the ad hoc
committee, the AEB wishes to express its dissent with the recommendations
of the committee. We are dealing here with a serious contravention of the
Constitution by Minister Maduna, as the Public Protector explicitly found.
I refer especially to section 41 on corporate governance.

The Minister violated the Constitution by not upholding the principles of
this section - at least subsections 41(1)(e),(f),(g) and (h) were grossly
violated. Minister Maduna's statements, made in and out of Parliament, were
untrue and unjustified. According to his lawyers, he realised that within
days, but only two years and R30 million in taxpayers' money later, he
admitted that he was wrong. As no sanctions are stipulated in the
Constitution, the Public Protector recommended that Parliament should
consider the necessary sanctions.

As a result, the Nel committee was born. At the very beginning of this
committee's actions, the question was asked whether this committee would
have the guts to bite, or whether it would at the end only bark a little
bit? In the end, the committee did not even bark at all. It did not even
give a small little bark like that of a ``skoothondjie'' [lap dog].

Na 'n jaar se gewatertrap, en drie keer se uitstel van die teikendatum, kom
die kommissie met 'n verslag wat in sy geheel net 'n regverdiging bied vir
afdeling 453, wat die Minister vrystel daarvan om enigsins om verskoning
hoef te vra.

Eintlik kom die komitee en sê: ``Jammer, Meneer die Openbare Beskermer, jy
is by die verkeerde adres. Die Parlement wil so graag, maar hy kan nie.
Iewers in die gryse verlede het die Minister tog immers gesê dat hy jammer
is en wat hy gesê het, terugtrek. En dit is mos voldoende, nie waar nie.
Gaan kyk, dit staan in Hansard.'' Die uitspraak in die De Lille-saak is as
misplaasde analogie betrek, om sodoende by 'n voorafooreengekome argument
uit te kom.

Mnr Andries Nel lyk vir my na so 'n eerlike man. Hy is boonop 'n
regsgeleerde, en hierdie komitee moes tog in 'n sekere mate regspraak
uitoefen. Ek daag hom uit om in die openbaar te verklaar dat daar in geen
stadium in die binnekringe van die ANC aan hom gesê is: ``Nelletjie, jy
moet keer vir die Minister se `wickets'.''

Die uitlatings van die Minister het hierdie land R30 miljoen gekos, en dit
is in syferterme meer as die sogenaamde Inligtingskandaal van destyds. Die
Ouditeur-generaal van die land is in diskrediet gebring, die Openbare
Vervolger vra ons optrede, die AEB vra steeds dat die Minister nou, hier,
ná die afhandeling van alles, duidelik sy apologie aanteken en deur die
Speaker ernstig vermaan word.

Die agb Minister is 'n ongeluk wat 'n plek soek om te gebeur, 'n volgende
een kan tot 'n reuse-katastrofe lei. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[After a year of treading water, and postponing the deadline three times,
the commission produced a report which in its entirety only offers
justification for section 453, which exempts the Minister from even
rendering an apology.

Actually the committee said: ``Sorry, Mr Public Protector, you are at the
wrong address. Parliament so dearly wants to, but it cannot. Somewhere in
the remote past the Minister said that he was sorry and retracted what he
had said. And that surely should be sufficient, not so? Go and have a look,
it is recorded in Hansard''. The judgment in the De Lille case was
implicated as a misplaced analogy in order to arrive at a prenegotiated
argument.

Mr Andries Nel looks like an honest man to me. Moreover, he is a lawyer and
surely this committee, to a certain extent, should have exercised the
administration of justice. I challenge him to declare publicly that at no
stage in the inner circles of the ANC he was told: ``Nelletjie, you must
defend the Minister's wickets.''

The statements of the Minister cost this country R30 million and in numeric
terms it is more than the so-called Information scandal of the past. The
Auditor-general of this country was brought into disrepute, the Public
Prosecutor has requested that we take action, the AEB is still requesting
that the Minister should here and now, after everything has been finalised,
clearly record his apology and that he should be severely reprimanded by
the Speaker.

The hon the Minister is an accident waiting for a place to happen, and
another one could lead to a major catastrophe.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, I think, when my colleague the hon Mzizi
spoke about the issue this afternoon, he indicated that we needed a way
forward, and that is indeed what we should be looking at. The fact that the
Minister transgressed is common cause and going back into that does not
really help us to go forward.

So, how do we go forward? I think the Public Protector requested that
Parliament should be looking at the whole subject of accountability, and
the accountability of Ministers and those who serve in the various organs
of state towards one another and towards Chapter 9 institutions. Therefore,
the nature of accountability is surely the key question to be discussed
today. This report, which is just over 301 pages ... [Interjections.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker, I just wish to mention, on a point of order,
that this is Mr Farouk Cassim from the IFP, and not Mr Carrim from the ANC!
[Laughter.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mrs Seaton and say that my
allegiance is still very much with the IFP.

This is a 301-page report and room probably exists within the Executive
Members' Ethics Act to set out a detailed procedure in respect of the
transgressions that we are talking about today.

This afternoon, when the Public Protector's words were quoted to the effect
that every cent spent by the state in pursuing this matter was well worth
it, it was met with loud derision by a section of this House. Was that, I
ask members, an appropriate response? Does such a response also breach the
bounds of mutuality? If Minister Maduna is bound to uphold the integrity of
Chapter 9 institutions, then we are also equally bound.

Today's debate should have been about accountability. A natural consequence
of accountability is sanctions. Once again, we need to explore this area
and set out the sanctions clearly in rules pertaining to members and their
privileges, but not on an ad hoc basis, because that would violate the
central principle of the Constitution to follow natural justice.

The Constitution also lays down the main rules by which we must act if
transgressions occur. Each member serving on any organ of state must know
what disciplinary measures and processes would follow, and what possible
sanctions could be applied. This was a golden opportunity given to us here
today to exercise our minds on the road ahead in order that whoever
transgresses in respect of Chapter 9 institutions would know clearly what
sort of processes would follow, and what kind of sanctions could be
applied.

There is no doubt that a lacuna exists here and, to that extent, the Nel
report is justified in pointing out that there is such a lacuna. If this
lacuna then exists, how is it going to be dealt with and when is it going
to be dealt with because, clearly, we cannot have a situation where a
lacuna in respect of a most important constitutional injunction exists. We
have to rectify this and do so speedily. That is the way to go forward.
That is the way to assure all Chapter 9 institutions that this Parliament
is committed to the upholding of the Constitution in both the letter and
the spirit. Therefore, on behalf of the IFP, we request that this
injunction of the Public Protector, which was not adequately dealt with, be
given further treatment, in order that the lacuna which exists can be
removed.

Mr J P CRONIN: Madam Speaker, what we have here is a very substantial
report from the Public Protector. The Public Protector makes 11 substantial
recommendations in his report. One aspect of these 11 recommendations is
that the Speaker of the National Assembly should take the necessary steps
to ensure that matters regarding sections 181 and 41 of the Constitution
are raised here in Legislature with the view to any possible sanction of
the Minister which the legislature might consider appropriate.
There are lots of mights, lots of shoulds. However, if one has tried to
follow the debate in the media, one could easily have been forgiven for
thinking that the Public Protector's report number 13 contains one, single
imperative thought - Parliament must sanction the Minister. Why is there
this tunnel vision? Why is there this obsession and this superficiality? Is
it because some in the opposition and some in the media see in this an
opportunity to milk the very last drop of advantage out of a mistake which
the Minister made and for which he has apologised? I am sure that this kind
of opportunism is part of the explanation why we have this obsession. But
we need to get behind the obsession because we require a fuller explanation
which goes to the heart of a number of differences in this House.

There is a paradigm out there which has a strong currency in certain
quarters of our society, and this paradigm holds that here on this dark
continent of jungle justice - according to the hon Gibson - democracy is a
frail and probably European edifice. One blink of the eye from Douglas
Gibson and we will be transported into Harare and next week we will find
ourselves with Idi Amin. In this paradigm, tyrants are all African. They
never come from anywhere else. [Interjections.] And so, week after week, we
are told by the scribes in the parliamentary gallery that our democratic
institutions are on the edge of an abyss. ``High noon for Parliament'',
reads one headline. ``Either the Ad Hoc Committee sanctions the Minister or
we plunge into the abyss''. ``Watershed week'', the hon Douglas Gibson told
us. ``Litmus test'', ``Do or die'', ``Last chance'', over and over again.

One cannot have a watershed week every week. [Interjections.] When one
tries to have a watershed every week, drama turns into melodrama and that
is what is happening. The most disgraceful example of this kind of doomsday
hyperbole, this kind of soap opera reading of Parliament came from an SATV
parliamentary journalist who, previewing the opening of Parliament,
obviously had no sense whatsoever of the very substantial state of the
nation address that our President was about to make. She chose to tell the
nation that it was ``make or break time for Parliament'', once again; that
the entire edifice of parliamentary democracy in South Africa rested on the
appointment or otherwise of one white judge's investigative unit. Judge
Heath was the last bastion between parliamentary democracy and a banana
republic.
Let us get real. Really, let us get real. Here in Parliament we all,
however much we like or dislike each other, share the fruits of the outcome
of the 1994 democratic breakthrough in our country. We all affirm the new
Constitution and we all insist, including the SACP, that we are democratic.
But what do we mean by democracy? We mean regular multiparty elections. I
think we seem to agree. [Interjections.]

I think we all agree that the rule of law is a core element of democracy,
although in the present case the opposition wants the ad hoc committee to
be the lawmaker, the judge and the prosecutor all in one. [Interjections.]
But I nonetheless think that generally we accept the rule of law. The
separation of powers, yes indeed, that is important; the independence of
the Chapter 9 institutions. I think we all agree that we need to safeguard
their reputation and their good standing.

I am sure we agree that we have to do this. But those who trumpet most
loudly about the independence and good standing of these Chapter 9
institutions are the very ones who squealed and vilified when the Human
Rights Commission tried to institute an investigation into racism. They
cannot have it both ways. [Interjections.]

However, there is at least one very core, critical, democratic value of
democracy which, I think, we do not share and that is where we part ways.
This is a core value and it is universally valid for all societies. But it
is of special significance in Third World countries, developing societies
and emerging democracies, emerging as they are, as we are, in the shadow of
powerful and typically unelected forces largely based in the North. This
core value of democracy is majority rule and what flows from that, the
relatively sovereign national capacity to translate electoral mandates into
actual political social and economic transformation on the ground. Without
this capacity the other democratic values are reduced to a charade.

What values are there in multiparty elections if the real policy choices
are taken by the IMF or the Club of Paris, which actually happens in some
countries in our region? That is the real threat to parliamentary
democracy, not whether Andries Nel sanctions a Minister or not.

For the ANC these core democratic values - majority rule and the capacity
to implement that majority mandate - in practice are linked to multiparty
elections, the freedom to organise, freedom of speech and separation of
powers. These are ways of deepening the connection between an elected
Government and the people. The role of Parliament is not to stand in the
way or to weaken or oppose Government simply for the sake of opposition.

However, the opposition fears this core aspect of democracy. It fears
majority rule. It fears an effective sovereign national Government capable
of implementing policies that benefit the majority of South Africans. That
is why, true to their prejudices and their supine inclinations, the
opposition opposed the Medicines and Related Substances Control Amendment
Bill in 1976. [Interjections.] Of course, they now have to beat a hasty
retreat from this revealing blunder. This is the difference between us and
them: For us democracy means answerability. [Interjections.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, is the hon member prepared to take a question?
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Cronin, are you prepared to take a question?

Mr J P CRONIN: If there is time at the end, I will take it.
[Interjections.] The difference between us is that whereas our core
understanding of democracy is that it is answerability to the majority,
their version of democracy that it is a tool to express fear of majority
rule.

This difference goes a long way to explain many things. For instance, a
great deal more members of the ANC than those of the opposition are
appalled by the abrogation of the rule of law in Zimbabwe. We are deeply
worried by the bombing of newspaper offices in Harare and by the
intimidation of the trade unionists in that country.

We see in these events grave danger signals in which an elected government
is deepening the divide between itself and its own former and still
potential mass base; deepening its isolation from the majority aspirations
and hopes, and therefore weakening its own sovereign capacity to push ahead
with the transformation programme for which it received such a landslide
mandate back in 1980. We see in these regrettable developments the logical
consequence, to some extent, of the hollowing out of democracy and
sovereign national capacity in Zimbabwe that goes back at least to 1990,
and the enforced implementation of a structural adjustment programme.

The opposition fears democratic majority rule and the potential that exists
when that majority is united. That is why it tries unendingly to pit the
former ANC president against the present ANC President. That is why the
present ANC President suddenly becomes a hero when they try to pit him
against two of his Ministers. They constantly try to sow division between
the ANC-led alliance, which is what they are trying now without much
success. That is why the opposition continually tries to get the ANC in
Parliament to act as if it were a minority in opposition to an ANC
Government.

We are not going to play into this paradigm. We are not going to be lured
into undermining due process or using an ad hoc committee for purposes for
which it was not intended. There is not going to be any showdown between
the ANC and the ANC on this issue. We are not going to get into this soap
opera of reversion of what we should be doing in Parliament and, as a
result of this - and this might offend Douglas Gibson's sense of ego and
melodrama - because we are declining to get into some kind of showdown and
high noon, there is not going to be any meltdown of democracy here in South
Africa. [Applause.]

On behalf of the ANC, I move the adoption of the Report of the Ad Hoc
Committee on Report 13 of the Public Protector. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the report be adopted.

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the report be adopted subject to the substitution of paragraph
  5(4)(d) by the following paragraph:


  (d) The Committee recommends that these matters be referred to the
       Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development for
       consideration and report and be submitted to the Constitutional
       Review Committee.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, this is the first that I have heard about
the amendment, and it certainly has not been given to me. We are not in a
position to consider this properly. Where is it?

Mr J H MOMBERG: Madam Speaker, the amendment to the report was circulated
by Parliament to all parties before 11h30 this morning.

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: The last speaker from
the ANC, Mr Cronin, also moved the report and then Mr Nel moved the
amendment. Now we have two motions here. Does Mr Cronin now withdraw his
moving of the original report without the amendment? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Just now, hon members, I would like to focus on
the issue of the amendment. I saw an hon member from the Freedom Alliance.
Do you want to address me?

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, I am not from the ``Freedom Alliance'', I
am a member of the FA. I just want to report that my party has not received
anything as alleged by hon member Momberg.
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! It would seem there is a situation in which
other parties might not have received the amendment. Is that the situation
with all opposition parties?

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker, we did receive it, but at 13h35.
[Interjections.]

Mr J J DOWRY: Madam Speaker, we have not received that amendment.
[Interjections.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, I think that the hon Momberg may have sent the
amendment to us. But if he sent it at 11h30, most of us were in committee
meetings and we have not received it.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I think I owe it to the House, in
particular the opposition parties, to listen to them about the issue of
whether or not they received the amendment. I think it is only fair that we
do so.

Now I would just like to see if hon members from the opposition parties
feel that they need a break to consider the amendment, or whether we should
proceed ... [Interjections.] No, hon members, when I am addressing the
House, I would like you to show some respect and listen to me.

Hon Lee, would you please show some respect. I am giving an opportunity to
opposition parties to put their case. I will hear them out on the issue of
whether or not they received the amendment ahead of time.

It would seem some did, while others did not. In that respect, some feel
that they might need to be given an opportunity to consider the amendment.
But, at the same time, opposition parties can, right here and now, decide
to vote against the amendment ... [Interjections] ... if they feel that
they did not have the opportunity to consider it, and therefore it is not
in keeping with what they would like to say. [Interjections.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, first of all, we have not had an opportunity
to consider the amendment. So, if it is going to be put, we would want time
to consider it. But I would like to raise a second point with you, and that
is to ask in what capacity the hon Mr Nel is moving an amendment. Does
every member of this House have the right, at this stage in the
proceedings, to stand up and move an amendment to the report that has been
tabled?

I do not understand under what Rule ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, please do not address me on any
other issue but the issue that I am dealing with right now, and that is the
issue of the amendment. [Interjections.]

My ruling on the question of the amendment is that we go on to the next
Order, and then we come back to the issue of the amendment to the report
... [Interjections] ... in order to give parties an opportunity to consider
the issue of the amendment. That, at this point, is my ruling.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, may I just ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, I do not want you to address me on
the amendment.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, I want to move an amendment myself.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, I do not want you to ... [Laughter.] Order!
[Interjections.] Order! [Interjections.] Hon members, we will now go on to
the next Order so that parties can consider what they would like to do on
the issue of whether or not to amend the report of the ad hoc committee.
That is my ruling.

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, so, we can move amendments when we ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! We will come back to the issue of the report.
[Interjections.]

Decision of Question postponed.

  EDUCATION: CAPTURING THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OUR CHILDREN FOR THE FUTURE

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, education can be defined as the
impartation or acquisition of knowledge, skill or discipline of character.
The function of education is thus to school persons in the ultimate values
of a culture. An excellent means to analysing the religion of any culture
is to study its concept of education.

The basic question which must be faced in order to give perspective to
education, is one of ownership. To whom does the child belong? The family
is the basic institution in society and is the trustee and steward of its
children, not the owner. The state educators' presupposition is that the
child is the property of the state. In all forms of Marxism, national and
international socialism alike, the child is a state resource to be
developed and used for the welfare of the state. It was the development of
this view of man, child and adult as property of the state, which led to
the development of state-controlled education.

There is a view held by existentialists and anarchists that the child is
his own lord and owner, and not under the state or parents. This view was
popularised in the 1960s by the hippie philosophy. It is influential
currently, and it is behind attempts to legislate a child bill of rights.

Facts and learning do not exist in a vacuum. There is always a context, and
what that context is will depend on our religious faith and presupposition.
No fact exists in and of itself. All facts are totally rational, because it
has the mind of God behind it, and their reality is more than physical and
natural.

Because education means the training of generations to come in the basic
values, goals and standards of the society, control is the central key to
power. As a result, whereas education had previously been a Christian
concern in the Western World, the rise of humanism in the form of the
enlightened education began to attract statist concern. The state has
become the ark of salvation and the new church of modern man who has sought
to bring education totally under the control of the state. To control the
future requires the control of education and the child.

State-run education has been the norm in South Africa for many decades. As
Christian parents relinquish their responsibilities to educate their
children, the state gleefully accepts that role. Those who educate the
children of the future control the voters of the future. Outcomes-based
education was designed by William G Spady, a sociologist, who has never
taught at school. It is a philosophy of masterly learning and attempts to
bring about attitudinal changes. Since outcomes are found in the nationally
distributed OBE curricula, the result will be children who all have been
trained to think the same way about major social problems. That is in the
way in which the OBE proponents want them to think.

Outcomes-based education will strip local school boards and parents of
their already significantly eroded authority, and then it will control and
transfer this authority directly to the state. The state is encouraged by
OBE to pass legislation that, with a few minor exceptions, eliminates all
current statutes pertaining to education. The results will be a greater
degree of uniformity in attitudes among individuals and a lower level of
overall excellence in academics.

Students are treated as guinea pigs in a radical experiment. The OBE system
offers no method of accountability to students, parents, teachers or
taxpayers. In the elementary grades, OBE does not teach children essential
reading, writing and arithmetic skills. All of this particularly lowers
test scores and achievement results that yearly embarrass most of South
Africa's public schools.

Teaching children how to count is not nearly as important as teaching
children what counts. Right from the start, an educational system is not
worth a great deal if it teaches children how to make a living but does not
teach them how to live.

Parents today must carefully consider all options before they hand their
child over to a school or teacher who believes that a child's basic reading
and writing skills are far less important than whether or not that child
accepts radical feminism and homosexuality as valuable lifestyles. Beyond
this, parents must decide exactly how important values really are. Who will
they allow to capture the hearts and minds of their children for the
future? Is it the state or is it the parent?

Children are not taught but are assessed. They will not fail even if they
cannot read or calculate properly. The new system is not designed to impart
knowledge, rather, its purpose is to replace the moral values that they
learn from their parents and give them new permissive and politically
correct ones. Educators are determined to mould children socially,
emotionally and intellectually by ridding them of the attitudes and values
which they bring from home so that they will be receptive to a new socially
prescribed way of thinking.

Big business backs the OBE system. They impose their model of reform on
schools. According to a youth market survey, the youth is becoming a high
focus area for marketers in all important sectors of the market. Children,
as children, are significant spenders and consumers. The youth market
comprises more than 51% of the population. There has been an excess of 12
million school children in South Africa. It has been confirmed that, in
South Africa, the youth spend an amount which is in the region of R4
billion per annum. It has been clearly indicated that children learn to
recognise brands at an early age, between three to five years.

One of the objects which was defined in that market research is that
marketers explore the school system on how they can influence a specific
target group in relation to certain brands that they want to market. The
methodology of the research shows that children are extremely sincere and
have no problem in showing their feelings and beliefs. Humans are seen as
merely machines who have no intrinsic value. Their only worth is what they
can produce.
Dr Chrissie Steyn of Unisa's Department of Religious Studies stated that
our children must live in the future and that the education of their
parents is not good enough for them. I ask the question: Whose children are
they? Do they belong to the state or to the parent? God gives parents
primary responsibility and authority for the education of the child.

Today, people want women's rights, children's rights, animal rights, gay
rights, abortion rights and so forth. If South Africa continues in the way
in which it is going, it will soon be given the last rites.

Martin Luther said, and I quote:


  I am much afraid that the schools will prove to be the wide gates to hell
  unless they diligently labour in explaining the Holy Scriptures,
  engraving them in the hearts of the youth. I advise no one to place his
  child where the Scriptures do not reign paramount. Every institution in
  which men are not constantly occupied with the word of God must become
  corrupt.

[Applause.]
Prof S M MAYATULA: Madam Speaker, this motion by the ACDP could not have
come at a better time - the Department of Education hosted a conference on
Values, Education and Democracy in the 21st Century only last month.

For this debate, I will confine myself to tolerance of different views and
perspectives to life as a value to be embraced by all South Africans,
especially the youth. I am not sure whether I have the same understanding
of the outcomes-based education as the hon Southgate, because, for the
first time, our children are allowed to be individuals, coming from
different societies, coming from different churches, and coming with
different values which need to be developed, instead of being the tabula
rasa, where the teacher must write his own views - on these blank slates.

Njengekholwa, Somlomo, ndivumele ndikhe ndenze imizekelwana ebonisa ukuba
thina singamaKrestu, kumaxesha ngamaxesha, siyalibala ukuhambisana nabanye
abantu. Endaweni yoko into esiyenzayo kukungabahloneli, sicinge ukuba zonke
izinto abazenzayo zizinto ezingento esimele ukuzibeka ecaleni.

Ndivumele ndenze umzekelo omnye. Ndithe ndisenkonzweni leza kum elinye
ilungu libindekile. Libuze ngale nto imbi kangaka siyenzayo kule Palamente
yokuba siyeke amaKomanisi asiqweqwedise kangangokuba siyeke nokuthandaza
phambi kokuba sivule kuba, ngokwalo mzalwana, ubuKrestu bubalulekile. Wonke
umntu ongenguye umKrestu makabekelwe ecaleni.

Ndiye ndimkhumbuze ke umzalwana lo ukuba kobu buRhulumente sikubo
sifikelele kwixesha lokuba uMgaqo-siseko wethu uzivumele iinkolo ngeenkolo
ukuba zingacinezelwa. Yiyo loo nto athi uSomlomo, xa siyivula le Palamente
imihla ngemihla, aqale asinike umzuzwana ukuze ngabanye ngabanye sithandaze
oothixo esicinga ukubathandaza. Ukuba asifuni kuthandaza singathandazi.
(Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[As a Christian, Madam Speaker, please allow me to cite a few examples to
show how we Christians, on numerous occasions, forget to co-operate with
other people. Instead, we disrespect them and we think that whatever they
do should be ignored as not worthy of our attention.

Please allow me to give just one example. I was at church one day and one
member of the congregation who looked very aggrieved came up to me. He
wanted to know why we allowed the Communists in this Parliament to mislead
us so much that we do not even pray before the start of our debates.
According to this man Christianity is important. All those who do not
follow the Christian faith should be left out.

I often remind him that our Government's Constitution allows for freedom of
religion. That is why Madam Speaker gives us a moment of silence every day
when opening Parliament, so that we can each direct our prayers to the gods
we wish to pray to. If we do not want to pray, we do not do so.]

Last week I attended a funeral where the priest went out of his way to
ridicule the way the alliance people and comrades greet each other - this
way of three steps - and said this is actually done by the boys,
amakwenkwe, and that he does not allow this in his church. I started
wondering whether he has taken into consideration that there are a number
of dignified people out there who are not amakwenkwe, or boys, and who,
through their own choice, have decided to accept this way of greeting? Does
this affect Christians in any way? Is it not good for us as Christians to
allow other people to do their own thing, and invite them to do what we do
through example and by talking to them?

One might ask, what are the values that we should inculcate into the minds
of our youth? In its definition of values, the Working Group on Values,
Education and Democracy has this to say:


  By values we mean desirable qualities of character such as honesty,
  integrity, tolerance, diligence, responsibility, compassion, altruism,
  justice and respect.

If all our children could be taught these values, I am sure South Africa
would be a different place.

In his remarks to the working group's report, the Minister of Education,
Prof Kader Asmal, had this to say:


  The moral fibre and value system of our people are constituted and
  reconstituted in our schools, in our places of worship, on sports fields
  and at the workplace. But the most important part of all these, where our
  kids spend most of their time, are our schools, and they must grasp this.

This report goes on to say, and I quote:


  We have to collectively develop and sustain values in our schools that
  are conducive to democracy, nation-building, antiracism and antisexism.

The working group came up with an all-embracing vow of allegiance which
sums up what is expected of us all as South Africans, in particular our
youth. It reads and I quote:


  I promise to be loyal to my country, South Africa, and to do my best to
  promote its welfare and the wellbeing of all of its citizens. I promise
  to show self-respect in all that I do and to respect all my fellow
  citizens and all of our various traditions. Let us work for peace,
  friendship and reconciliation and heal the scars left by past conflict,
  and let us build a common destiny together.

Let us not undermine other religions. Let us not do what is happening in
Afghanistan now, where all the ancient Buddhist monuments are being
destroyed. Why? Because the ruling party happens not to like what they are
doing. Let us as Christians not allow our people to do what was done to us,
which was the persecution of Christians. Let us embrace everybody and work
together. We should instil the kind of attitude in our children that we,
all of us, are part of the human race, and that as a part of the human
race, our Constitution gives us the right to dignity, which we should
extend to everybody.

Unfortunately, sometimes we as Christians do not go as far as that. We look
at our people differently, and we say things such as, ``I would love to
love you, but unfortunately, you are not white enough'', or ``I would love
to love you, but it seems your culture and traditions do not make you a
human being''. Why do we not, as Christians, see Christ in whoever we see,
and allow them to do their own thing? If we do that, we are going to
develop a better country and future, and our children are going to respect
us for that. [Applause.]

Mr R S NTULI: Madam Speaker, hon members, throughout history education has
tended to serve the interests and objectives of political, cultural and
economic systems. In South Africa, education was once an instrument to
divide people racially and ethnically. Consistent with this ideology, black
institutions, schools and universities alike - black ones, I mean - were to
function more as detention centres for black intellectuals than centres
that would nourish intellectual thought. It was this ideological trust and
its attendant conditions that formed the basis for resistance. Black
institutions, indeed, served as incubators for the struggle against
apartheid.

In 1994 South Africa, contrary to the prophets of doom, succeeded in
achieving a peaceful transition to democracy, although the possibility of a
protracted conflict and violence was extremely high. But thanks to God
Almighty it did not happen. Our new democratic and liberal Constitution
ushered in a new set of values that made a fundamental break with the past.
These values, with proper nourishing and advocacy, can assist in capturing
the hearts and minds of our children for a better future. This new set of
values is underpinned by the Preamble of the Constitution, which boldly
states, and I quote:
  Heal the divisions of the past and establish a society based on
  democratic values, social justice and fundamental human rights;


  Lay the foundations for a democratic and open society in which government
  is based on the will of the people and every citizen is equally protected
  by the law;


  Improve the quality of life of all citizens and free the potential of
  each person; and


  Build a united and democratic South Africa ...

We must accept that tremendous and conscious effort and purposeful action
will be necessary from all of us to realise the intent and the spirit of
the Constitution. It would be naïve to expect that the severe erosion and
denial of human dignity to a big section would heal quickly, and that
without purposeful effort active reconciliation would easily be ushered in.

While a holistic approach is necessary to constitute and nurture the moral
fibre and value systems of our people, the home as a functional unit of
society, the workplace and, in particular, schools and other learning
centres, will remain the major propelling agents and custodians of our
value systems. Schools are the social institutions through which the value
systems of nations are conveyed from generation to generation. Commendable
work has been done in this regard by the Department of Education to show us
the path which we should follow. The DP wishes to congratulate the hon the
Minister on his vision and dynamic leadership in this matter.

The working group as alluded to by the previous speaker presented a formal
report of its findings regarding the protection and promotion of values in
education. This invaluable report is indeed a suitable starting point in
what ought to become a national debate on the appropriate values for South
Africa to nurture and advocate in our educational institutions. These
values naturally derive from the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, as
well as the consideration of educational philosophy. The values that were
noted were equity, tolerance, multilingualism, openness, accountability and
social honour. The report highlights three elements to an educational
philosophy.

The first is to develop intellectual ability and cultural faculties among
our children and young adults in our schools. A democratic society can only
function best when its citizens have a clear understanding of the history
and current affairs, and where nothing is beyond question.

Secondly, the educational philosophy of our democracy should emphasise
inclusiveness which will develop a culture and ethos in our schools which
actively include all learners irrespective of their background in the
formal and informal aspects of school life. This requires an appreciation
and acceptance of cultural diversity, actively encourage multilingualism
and religious tolerance.

Thirdly, our educational philosophy should provide learners with tools to
solve many problems that come with being human throughout one's life span.
We need to teach our children to treat problems as challenges to be solved
through knowledge and understanding rather than as unbearable burdens to be
endured without solutions. The will and courage to approach life in this
manner does not simply reside in science, but in the spirituality of
humanity that defines our attitude in life. This suggests a need to have a
religious attitude to life.
Finally, as custodians of these value systems, especially our teaching
corps, we must not only accept and cherish these value systems, but we must
also practice these value systems so that we should be able to create a
happy and dynamic educational atmosphere which will reflect the values and
goals of our community and to provide a balanced education encompassing the
academic, cultural, social and spiritual development of our children so
that each of of them can reach their potential and be the best they can be.

We wish to appeal to teachers to be loyal to their duties and their
obligations as registered members of the South African Council of Educators
to do all that is possible and desirable to enhance the status of the
teaching profession, to continually engage in professional self-development
and to regulate their professional conduct especially when dealing with
learners. They should do this in a manner where individually and
collectively they can be proud to say that indeed their profession is the
mother of all professions. Only then will we be on our way to capture the
hearts and minds of our children for the future. [Applause.]

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Chairperson, I did not mean malice when I thought that
capturing the hearts and minds of our children might have been understood
to mean liberating the hearts and minds of our children for the future. Our
children are already captive. They are in bondage, chained, enslaved. They
are handcuffed by social pressures, such as material things, illiteracy,
unemployment, Aids and crime. So we should unshackle them, free them and
deliver them. Maybe we could change that a little bit. That is what will be
the angle of my presentation.

Our youth are becoming victims of all that is base and profane, where
pornography, degeneracy and promiscuity are being promoted in books,
magazines and motion pictures, where mawkish, pathetic shows are passed off
as entertainment on television and the big screens. It is still more
sickening to see pill-popping, beer-guzzling, cigarette-sucking, cocaine-
snorting and freakish kwaito Yizo Yizo youths being held up as examples or
role models of the modern South African youth. I wonder what education is
going to do about that or how it is going to assist with that.

Even more sickening was a march, a week ago, in which children, instead of
concentrating on their classical and didactical situation or their
cognitive development in the classroom, rather went and were enmeshed by
and immersed in an orgy of destruction in the streets of Johannesburg.
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. What has happened to our
education seems to be what Shakespeare said in Hamlet, I think.

Our children need to be rescued from this polyglot of evil, this plethora
of veritable rivers of misguided freedom, pleasures and amusement. I was
not amused last night when everybody spoke about reconciliation. I did not
see any reconciliation between the ``pampoen boere's children'' [pumpkin
farmers' children] and the black children when Mr Terre'Blanche arrived to
serve his prison sentence. I do not know what to say about racial harmony
and tolerance levels. I so hate polarisation and racism. I do not know
where the rainbow youth are and what education is going to do about this.

Some fingers, as the hon Southgate said, are also being pointed at the
effect that secular, dialectical humanism and situational ethics might have
on the classical situation where some teachers are being accused of being
conveyors and purveyors of diabolical edicts in the classroom and outside.

There are so many things with regard to education, but the worst dilemma
facing our youth today is that we are sitting here with 72% of young people
who will account for all new HIV/Aids infections by the year 2005. I cannot
say more. Within a decade, about 40% of South Africans will be between the
ages of 15 and 24, and I do not know how well it bodes for the success of
education.

I think that we need to go back to the drawing board and develop new
programmes or adjust programmes which are already in place. I know that the
Department of Education has made great strides in this sphere. As the
prophet Isiah said, ``though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as
white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool''. He
said: ``Come now, let us reason together''.

So, this chemistry of reasoning together between core Government
departments is a prognosis for victory, with a little help here and there.
So, all is not doom and gloom. But where something is rotten in the state
of Denmark, it has to stop. [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, the previous speaker made a telling point
when he said that the last thing that we needed in South Africa was a
repetition of what happened yesterday outside the courtroom in
Potchefstroom, and I agree with him.

This is my maiden speech on education and, hopefully, I will be protected
against interjections from the floor. [Laughter.] The subject for
discussion is Education: Capturing the hearts and minds of our children for
the future.

Mao Tse-tung - the Minister of Education would probably refer to him as
``Comrade Mao'' - once said that if one wants to build a new society, one
must first get rid of the enemies in the hearts and minds of the people.
Now, unlike Mao, I do not believe that destruction necessarily precedes
construction, and I would therefore like to take a much more positive line.

If we want to build a new nation we will have to impress specific values
conducive to nation-building on the hearts and minds of our children while
they are still at school. In order to achieve this objective, schools
should play a much bigger and a much more important role than merely being
assembling lines for the labour market.

Filosowe wat konsentreer op die toekoms, soos Marcuse en Van Peursen,
voorsien 'n toekomstige samelewingsmodel waar werksgeleenthede, as gevolg
van fenomenale tegnologiese vooruitgang, die uitsondering gaan wees en nié
die reël nie. Skole moet kinders ook op só 'n moontlikheid en situasie kan
voorberei.

Weens die beperkte tyd tot my beskikking kan ek nie uitbrei op waardes wat
bevordelik is vir nasiebou en reeds op skoolvlak by ons kinders ingeskerp
moet word nie. Ek kan net in die verbygaan daarna verwys. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Philosophers who concentrate on the future, like Marcuse and Van Peursen,
anticipate a future societal model where job opportunities will be the
exception and not the rule as a result of phenomenal technological
advances. Schools should also be able to prepare children for such a
possibility and situation.

Because of the limited time at my disposal I cannot elaborate on values
which are conducive to nation-building and which should already be
impressed on our children at school level. I can only refer to that in
passing.]

An important value conducive to nation-building which we must impress on
the hearts and minds of our children is that rights imply duties. One does
not simply have a right, one also has a duty, a responsibility. And I think
in this regard we can take a leaf out of The African Charter on Human and
People's Rights. This document, the only one of its kind to do so, equates
rights with duties in the preamble. Let me quote from this document:


  ... considering that the enjoyment of rights and freedoms also implies
  the performance of duties on the part of everyone.

I fully endorse that.

South Africa is a violent society. We must impress the need to solve
conflict in a non-violent manner on the hearts and minds of our children,
and at the same time teach them the skills to do so. Conflict resolution
should become a compulsory subject at school level.

Aids poses the single biggest threat to nation-building. There may be many
reasons for the disease spreading so fast. Immorality is undoubtedly one of
them, and we must impress on the hearts and minds of our children moral
values emanating from a religious way of life. Simply addressing the
symptoms of Aids is not the final answer.

Finally, we should impress on the hearts and minds of our children the need
for mutual respect and understanding, which is imperative for nation-
building. [Applause.]

Mr C T FROLICK: Madam Speaker, hon members, the subject under discussion
captures the challenge facing all South Africans as our society is
continuously being transformed from one that was based on an evil and cruel
ideology into a caring society, which must have the wellbeing of all its
citizens at heart.

Whatever value system prevails, our children must realise that the glaring
inequalities as a result of previous policies are still evident in all
walks of society, especially in education. It requires deliberate
intervention by the Government, civil society and all other stakeholders,
to address these imbalances. These disparities are firmly entrenched
between the rich and the poor, urban and rural communities and the haves
and the have-nots. We need to ask ourselves not only what is the value
system that should prevail, but also how we can lead our children and what
we can do for them to believe that they have a meaningful contribution to
make in our country.

In addressing these questions, our vision should be inspired and driven by
a value system with a deep commitment to change the painful living
conditions affecting so many South Africans today. The majority of our
people are still victims of the devastating effects of poverty, and this
deprives them of hope and relegates them to a state of despair. It destroys
their capacity to achieve.

Deliberate intervention must be undertaken to conscientise our children
about the challenges facing our nation and the contribution they can make
in arriving at lasting solutions. The creative power in our diversity must
be set free, so as to allow each child to fulfil his or her own potential
within an accepted value system. The actions must be guided by values such
as respect for life, dignity and human worth of every individual.

Tolerance and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and national
self-discipline should be based on an acceptance that each right and
freedom carries with it a corresponding and equal obligation and
responsibility. Ultimately, all of us should strive towards guiding our
country's children to become patriotic, caring citizens with an unbridled
passion to put the interests of the country first, as we strive to do what
is best for South Africa.

Genl C L VILJOEN: Mevrou die Speaker, om die jeug se toewyding en energie
te fokus op die toekoms moet ons in die eerste plek ophou om hulle denke te
besoedel met die slegte uit die verlede. As ons altyd net terugkyk op die
slegte en die slegte opdien, dan verloor ons die toekoms. Bewaar ons jeug
daarvan. Laat ons tog weer ag slaan op die woorde van 'n wyse Paul Kruger.
Hy was sterwend as 'n balling, sy volk verslaan, 26 000 vroue en kinders
het in die konsentrasiekampe omgekom, maar steeds leef hy sy Bybelse
riglyne uit in sy laaste boodskap. Hy haat nie en hy neem uit die verlede
dit wat mooi en edel is en bou daarop die toekoms.

Dit is 'n mooi boodskap vir die jeug. Moenie ons jongmense se gees besoedel
met die negatiwiteit van die verlede nie. Hulle hart en gees kan ten beste
vasgevang word vir die toekoms deur middel van positiwiteit.

Ek wil slegs drie punte noem in die tyd tot my beskikking. Eerstens is daar
die positiewe aspek van moedertaalonderwys vir leerlinge en onderwysers. 'n
Vreemde opvoedingstaal skep spanning en onsekerheid by die jeug en dit
vervreem die geleerdes van die res, aldus adjunk-minister Mangena.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Gen C L VILJOEN: Madam Speaker, to focus the commitment and energy of the
youth on the future we must, in the first place, stop polluting their
thoughts with the bad aspects of the past. If we always simply look back at
the bad and serve it up, we lose the future. Protect our youth from that.
Let us once again heed the words of a wise Paul Kruger. He was dying in
exile, his people had been defeated, 26 000 women and children had died in
the concentration camps, but he still lived out his Biblical guidelines in
his final message. He did not hate and he took from the past what was good
and noble and built the future on that.

This is a good message for the youth. Do not pollute the spirit of our
young people with the negativity of the past. Their hearts and spirits can
best be captured for the future by way of positivity.

I want to mention only three points in the time at my disposal. Firstly,
there is the positive aspect of mother-tongue education for pupils and
teachers. A foreign language of instruction creates tension and uncertainty
among the youth and this alienates the educated from the rest, according to
Deputy Minister Mangena.]

The FF also agrees with the Deputy Minister when he gives us another
direction as to how to capture the hearts and minds of our youth for the
future. He said:


  Without culture we are reduced to ordinary animals. Our norms, values and
  customs are intricately intertwined with our culture.

We agree with this. We should therefore allow for an own identity, whilst
having respect for others. Do not force the youth into assimilating into a
strange, new, undefined common culture which we all do not know.

Thirdly, hearts and minds of the future are coupled to hurts from a divided
past. Allow all the youth equal opportunities. Do not push affirmative
action down the throat of our young generations. Allow them the dignity to
stand on an equal footing.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, hon members, children are the wealth of the
nation. We have to take extreme care in educating them, lest they be fed
the wrong stuff. Who educates them and what they are being taught and where
and how they are being taught, are matters that have to be heeded.

For education to succeed, educators and parents have to accept that
learners are their business. Educators have to do their utmost because once
they fail in delivery, it may not be possible to recall all learners who
went through their school to overhaul them, as one would do with motor
vehicles which show a common defect.

Teachers must do all they can at first attempt, because the failure of a
teacher in making a man or a woman of substance out of the pupils he has
taught, is something that will haunt him or her for as long as he or she
lives. He or she will continue to see the failure in life, unlike a doctor
whose failures are buried and are forgotten in time. Our educators and
learners should be imbued with the reality that education is not switched
on and off at the ringing of the school bell. Learners must be prepared to
assimilate as much as they can and teachers must be prepared to impart as
much as they can.

After all, a teacher is unlike a candle, whose light burns out the longer
it burns. With the teacher, the more he imparts light, the more he becomes
enriched himself. We should strive for a situation in which we see children
in pursuit of knowledge, and not knowledge in pursuit of children, as is
the case these days.

John F Kennedy once said: ``A child miseducated is a child lost.'' We
cannot afford to let our children go astray. After all, the great end of
education is to discipline the mind rather than to furnish the mind.
Education has to train the mind to use its own powers rather than fill it
with the accumulation of others. Parents and teachers must be models
according to which children can hope to live. The answer to all our
national problems, and those of the world, is embodied in a single word.
That word is ``education''.

Mrs J CHALMERS: Madam Speaker, hon Ministers, members of the House, there
is no doubt that children are the most valuable asset in any society for,
as has often been stated, they are the future.

Certainly, the old nationalist government recognised this fact, which is
why they gave so much attention to ensuring that the majority of children
in this country had a limited future. They made sure that our children were
ill-educated and did not grow up in a secure family environment. They spent
long years mapping out a landless future for our children and devising,
with truly evil intent, shackles and chains that attempted to bind them
forever in psychological dependency.

On 1 June 1956, Mr H S Erasmus, NP member for Odendaalsrus, said in the
House of Assembly:


  ... I feel that it is most desirable for all young Natives, say between
  15 and 16 years of age, to be placed in youth camps so that they can do
  land service, and do it gratis ... They must be taught to work with a
  pick and shovel, because they will need that knowledge in their lives.

The Machiavellian schemes of the NP were more than 50 years in the hatching
and implementation, and their effects are still painfully evident in this
country. The challenges are huge. There is land to be redistributed through
due process so that our children can benefit from what is rightfully
theirs. There are languages to be learned so that our children can
communicate with one another. There are games to be played so that our
children can form teams with common goals so that they can learn to know
and love one another. There are also values to be ensured so that our
children, rather than having their hearts and minds captured, will have
them freed to enable them to look and learn from good examples in such a
way that they, in turn, will be an example for the next generation.

The education of our children begins at birth, as they begin to assimilate
and learn about their surroundings and absorb the values and cultures into
which they have been born. The family, whether it be nuclear or extended,
is the growth medium of a child, and like any growth medium, if it is
lacking in nutrients, it risks producing a stunted product. This is a risk
which our Government is fully aware of. Indeed, fundamental changes are
beginning to happen in the now Department of Social Development to make
that growth medium a secure and developmental one and not merely one of
survival.

Modern society puts our children at so much risk. There are obvious dangers
and here our Government is taking multiple steps to reduce these risks. I
think here of the devastation on our roads and what the state is doing to
try and limit that carnage. But civil society must take more responsibility
for what is happening, giving clear direction to our children of the need
to protect themselves from the effects of that carnage. It is truly
distressing to see, despite legislation and the technology to address the
problem, the numbers of children not made secure in cars. I would plead for
much stronger actions against seatbelt offenders.

I think of children and guns, and the tragedies that occur through parental
negligence, and here the Firearms Control Act may go quite a long way to
preventing future tragedies of this sort. Once again, management of the
firearm scenario requires committed co-operation from civil society, and
consideration could be given to creating an opportunity for children to
become part of the debate on how to manage the threat guns present to
society. I remember an occasion where a group of children organised
themselves to lobby against the sale of toy guns. They really caught the
attention of the public.

I think of the horror of child abuse. In a supplementary of last week's
Sunday Times 62% of young people interviewed stated that child abuse is one
of the greatest concerns for them today, with many reports from teenagers
of having had personal experiences within their homes and schools. This
abuse does not remain with those children for it is a proven fact that
abused children frequently become abusing parents and the cycle is
perpetuated. I hope and trust that the rationalisation of the child
protection unit will mean more, and not less, protection for our children.

I would like to say something here about HIV/Aids, for in South Africa it
is a children's issue. Apart from those infected, it is estimated that
within the next five years, 1 million children under the age of 15 years
are expected to lose one or both parents to Aids. Throughout the country
many vulnerable communities, households and families are developing
strategies enabling them to address and cope with the impact of HIV/Aids on
household security. I would make a plea for us to undertake more research
into these community-initiated strategies and for action to underpin these
initiatives with as much support as possible.

Lastly, it is true to say that our children are growing up in a world full
of danger and risk. But we should also recognise that we have a
responsibility to open their eyes to the wonders of this world and to open
their ears so that they can tune into the sounds of the world around them.
We have a responsibility, too, to engender in them an understanding that
the resources of our earth, whether they be trees, water or the very soil
itself, are valuable and not to be used to destroy it lightly, that the
stories they hear at their grandmother's knee are a precious part of their
heritage and that the cultural skills of the past have a value in the
future because, and I repeat, these are our children and they are the
future. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, our children are our greatest asset and our
nation's most valued resource. We owe it to our children to provide
facilities and an environment which will give them a good life.

Education, and specifically early childhood education, is the bridge that
crosses to a full life. Jesus said:


  I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.

They should have it to the brim; in fact, bubbling over.

It is now universally accepted that the first five years of life are the
most crucial years, because 90% of the growth of the human brain takes
place during this time. In the same period, 50% of the growth of the body
is completed. This means that during the first five years children need 90%
of our time, 90% of our life, love and 90% of our money; that is, our
Budget.

In a country with a history of deep racial attitudes and prejudices, we
need to admit that some older people will never change their fixations and
indoctrinations. Some will go to their graves with their attitudes and
superstitions. Children are our best hope and our best building blocks for
the future. Jean Jacques Rousseau said:


  Everything is good as it come from the hands of the maker, but
  degenerates in the hands of man.

Children should be made to appreciate the richness and beauty of our plural
society with its wide variety of cultures and gifts, and that our
differences are a blessing from God. We should cultivate in the minds of
our children a strong sense of belonging to this land which God has given
us. They should know that they are Africans and should be proud of it. We
should teach our children at least three of the eleven official languages.

Ignorance of languages used daily by many people makes one feel like a
foreigner in one's country. All schools should have equal facilities and no
child should learn in a school which is dilapidated and dirty. A full-
rounded education curriculum should be provided so that we do not produce
lethal automatons, machines and robots. Religious education and religious
values should be given. ``The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom
and, again, one shall know the truth and the truth shall make one free''.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the MF advocates that education and the
livelihood of our children are everyone's responsibility. We do have
weaknesses and strength in the education system. However, our collective
responsibility is to meet these challenges with a critical attitude to
improve the quality of life of our children.

The MF recognises that the restructuring of the primary, secondary and
higher education system is aimed at addressing crises and dealing with the
transformation. Therefore, efforts are made to formalise the output and
productivity of the education system, so that it can complement the family
dynamics, prepare the youth academically and provide a vision of a new
social order in South Africa.

Parents, educators, learners, society and the Government must work in
partnership to cultivate a habit of learning and commitment, irrespective
of obstacles we are facing. Uncompromising responsibility must be the
yardstick to guide the hearts and intellects of our children to accept the
diverse purpose in life, which ultimately decides the destiny of South
Africa.

Special efforts must be made by the Education department to promote the
understanding of the South African Schools Act of 1996, in particular the
issue of school fees, which is highly misunderstood. The inability of poor
parents to pay school fees has embarrassed learners and it has resulted in
many school dropouts. Other serious issues that are hurting our children's
enthusiasm to meet the challenges in life are crime, drug addiction,
alcoholism and HIV/Aids. The MF is appealing to all role-players in society
to spearhead available action plans to address these problems in their
communities.

The question of children with disabilities in mainstream education is still
an issue to be grappled with. After all, we know that the opportunity to
contribute to the development of the country should not discriminate
against disabled children.

The power of our children's hearts and intellect will determine their
preparedness to invest their creative energies in South Africa. [Applause.]

Mrs M S MAINE: Madam Speaker and members of the NA, on 27 May 1992 to 1
June 1992, 17 regions assembled in Somerset West to discuss and draft the
Children's Charter of South Africa. It was realised that children in South
Africa have not been treated with respect and dignity, which was the result
of the apartheid era that has caused discrimination, violence, racism and
the destruction of families and communities. It disrupted education, social
relationships and separated many children from their parents and
communities.

In 1994, at the Orlando Stadium, the Government ratified the UN Convention
on the Rights of the Child. In 1996 the National Plan of Action was
officially launched, and later provincial programmes of action were
launched. Local programmes of action were developed in some municipalities.

Due to the fact that the process came from the Mass Democratic Movement and
because South African children, especially African, seized space and
demanded to the heard during the liberation struggle, the national plan of
action strongly encouraged the participation of children. Their voices are
always listened to, as far as the ANC is concerned. The children continued
to play an important role throughout South African society and in the NPA.

This is proved by the statement the President made at the Commonwealth
summit, when he said, and I quote:


  If we want to say that life is changing for the better, that there is any
  improvement, and that we are better off today than we were yesterday,
  that must show in the children.

If this does not prove that we in the ANC are the champions in capturing
the hearts and minds of our children for the future, then the hon member's
name is North and not South.

(Translation of Setswana paragraphs follows.)

[In the past, a child who was born in a Christian home - I heard the priest
mentioning Christianity - was taught that he did not have the right to
argue with any adult, be it in his home or in the community. This led to
many children being made to suffer by adults. These children had nowhere to
make their complaints.

That was changed by our new Constitution for the reasons I have already
mentioned. It ensures that the children should not suffer and be oppressed.
I also want to appeal to the hon member that what he should know about the
ANC is that South Africa's National Plan of Action is the best in the whole
world. It ensures that every department should make a contribution in
looking after the hearts, the feelings and indeed even a better life for
our children.
What I am asking is that members of the ACDP should remember that they have
taken an oath in this House that they will abide by the Constitution. As
such, they should ensure that they do not do anything that will make us
suspect that they want to take our children back to the old constitution.

There is nothing wrong with the Christian faith, but it becomes a joke when
Christians use it to oppress our children. The ANC encourages children at
all times to respect the elderly and other children, as well as their
religions, and that they should take pride in that. But they must not be
silly and agree to everything.

As the adults of the National Assembly, we should encourage our children to
stand together with the sole intention of working for their country, South
Africa, so that Africa should be the best in the whole world.

We believe that we are on the right track. As the ANC, we have increased
the child care grant so that in the end their minds, hearts and feelings
are ready for a better future. This will encourage the building of
hospitals, clinics and schools in future.
A soul needs belief, a heart needs happiness, but life needs freedom. On
the other hand, a mind needs to work without being oppressed. This implies
that the soul looks after the mind, the feelings and a better life for the
future of our children.

As the ANC, we apply the wishes and aspirations of President Mbeki when he
said during the opening of Parliament and I quote:


  ... no African child should ever again feel ashamed to be an African.

As the ANC, we show this in our plan on drought relief, which has been
allocated R1,5 billion. This amounts to having our children's interests and
future in mind, because when hunger is reduced, the children become healthy
and happy.]

The ANC, in capturing the hearts and minds of our children for the future,
are the champions.

Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, may I start by congratulating Mrs Southgate on
an excellent speech. I intend to publish it in our newspaper. I see the
Minister is smiling. I would like to tell him that she could just as well
have studied at Potchefstroom University.

By the way, a comment was made about Potchefstroom. I would just like to
tell the Minister that that had nothing to do with the university. It was
the agricultural college which they mentioned.

Sy het die kritieke vraag gevra: Aan wie behoort ons kinders? Behoort hulle
aan die staat of aan die ouer? Ek wil graag verder hierop uitbrei. Die ouer
is primêr verantwoordelik. Ek het met die doop van elkeen van my vyf
kinders, wat nou al uit die huis uit is, 'n belofte voor God afgelê dat ek
hulle in die Leer sal onderrig en sal laat onderrig.

Die ideaal is daarom nie 'n staatskool nie, ook nie 'n kerkskool nie, maar
'n ouerskool. Omstandighede het daartoe gelei dat daar staatskole is. Die
vertrekpunt van die debat is ``capturing the hearts and minds of our
children.'' (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[She asked the critical question: To whom do our children belong? Do they
belong to the state or to the parent? I would like to elaborate on this.
The parent has the primary responsibility. At the baptism of each of my
five children, none of whom is living at home any longer, I made a promise
before God that I would instruct them and have them educated in accordance
with biblical teachings.

The ideal, then, is not a public school, or a church school, but a parent
school. Circumstances led to the emergence of public schools. The point of
departure of the debate is ``capturing the hearts and minds of our
children''.]

Do we want schizophrenic children, learning one value system at home and
another one at school? Definitely not!

Daarom my pleidooi: 'n versterking vir ouerinspraak; 'n eie etos en
karakter vir skole wat deur die ouers bepaal word. Dit is dalk nog die
beste moontlik in ons omstandighede vandag, by 'n onafhanklike skool.

Die African Charter erken die reg van privaatskole volgens eie etos en
karakter. Ons Grondwet voeg daarby: ``op eie koste'', en dit is
diskriminerend. Daar is universele waardes, morele waardes, billikheid en
respek. Hierdie waardes geld vir almal. Ons onderskryf hulle, maar daar is
ook spesifieke waardes wat nie minder belangrik is nie. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Hence my plea: stronger parental input; an own ethos and character for
schools determined by the parents. Under today's circumstances that may
best be possible at an independent school.

The African Charter acknowledges the right of private schools to their own
ethos and character. Our Constitution adds ``at their own expense'', and
that is discriminatory. There are universal values, moral values, equity
and respect. These values apply to everyone. We endorse them, but there are
also special values which are no less important.]

We must guard against moral, cultural and linguistic imperialism. South
Africa is not a homogeneous country, and never will be.

Ons is ryk in verskeidenheid. Kom ons erken dit. Dit help nie ons het 'n
artikel 185 en 'n artikel 31 oor vryheid van godsdiens nie, en ons kinders
se harte en gedagtes word gevange gehou op 'n wyse wat hierdie unieke
waardes binne 'n geslag of twee laat versand in die vaal woestyn van
algemeenheid nie.

Baie dankie aan mev Southgate vir 'n uitstekende onderwerp. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We are rich in diversity. Let us acknowledge this. It does not help us to
have a section 185 and a section 31 on freedom of religion, while our
children's hearts and thoughts are held captive in a manner which will lead
to the silting up of these unique values in the pale desert of generality
within a generation or two.

Thank you very much to Mrs Southgate for an excellent topic.]

Mr K M N GIGABA: Chairperson, time has passed and with it the rotten ideas
that defined the black youth as mere hewers of wood and drawers of water,
and taught them that equality with the white man was not their destiny.
Gone, too, are the days when the hearts and minds of our youth were to be
captured through the Christian National Education, Bantu Education and
other forms of repression intended to coerce the majority to believe in the
twisted logic of apartheid supremacy. That was a tragedy and a crime.

Thank God time has passed and onward ever we continue to march happily as
masters of our own destiny, determined to change the moorings of old
society and construct a better future. This future, whose architects and
constructors we must become, is not some remote period somewhere on the
distant horizons, but it is what we are building today.

To start building it, the youth of our country must do more than just wait
passively for the positive results of the processes of progressive change.
But, neither must our country seek to capture their hearts and minds.
Rather, we must inspire them to action and to unite in action for their own
development and that of their country as a whole, indeed, to build their
future themselves.

The possibility exists today to make further advances in raising the level
of social consciousness of our youth, through education, to prepare them to
fulfil their tasks. I want to stress that our nation cannot accept that its
youth must traverse through this given space and time as a purposeless
generation. Accordingly, we must proceed from the determination to take
firm responsibility for our future, convinced that the future of our people
and their prospects for a better life depend on the role which we shall
play at this time.

We, too, like the majority of our people, must constantly ponder: ``What
can I do to build a better South Africa?'' Deep in our conscience, as
youth, must exist a strong conviction that a youth that does not value
their country does not deserve their future. Therefore, we should become
activists in the historic process to fundamentally transform ours into a
truly nonracial, nonsexist, united, democratic, prosperous and caring
society.

Central to the pursuit of this strategic objective is the creation of a
cadre of South African patriot who understands the tasks and obligations
that accompany such a difficult challenge. From the ranks of our youth must
emerge a cadre that champions national unity and a better life. These young
women and men should have a great sense of duty towards the society that we
are creating.

They must possess a deep sense of social responsibility, civic
consciousness, social discipline and a deep hatred for all discrimination,
oppression and exploitation. They must be militants against poverty,
illiteracy, diseases and combatants for nonracialism and nonsexism, as well
as for the attainment of the objectives of the African century. Each and
every one of them must thrive to be best at everything, knowing that their
high ambitions, strong will and hard work is what our country needs to
succeed.

It goes without saying that the achievement of these goals depends, among
others, on the role that education will play to both empower the youth with
the skills and knowledge requisite for the fulfilment of all these
challenges, and to lead this youth through their own lessons, experiences
and mistakes to arrive at correct conclusions and develop the values
consonant with the type of society that we are building.

Our education system should be adequately and strategically utilised as an
instrument for social and economic emancipation. For this reason, Tirisano
must succeed. Outcomes-based education must succeed. The new moral
education plan must also succeed. Each and every one of us must do their
part to support these programmes. Only in this way can we succeed to
develop among our youth thinkers and not mere stooges and zombies whose
hearts and minds have been captured. Those of us who fight for freedom
fight as well for the freedom of the mind, body, heart and soul.

Of course, education must be reinforced in this effort by, among others, an
extensive national youth service programme which must both empower and
rally the youth into action. For this, we cannot employ fascist and
instrumentalist strategies. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Mr Chairperson, hon Ministers and hon members, we believe
that all freedoms have limitations. Even this very House is governed by
rules. So, when we talk about capturing the hearts and minds of our
children for the future, we do not speak about this in a negative sense.

The ACDP believes that every education system promotes a particular world-
view. And this is the point we want to make: It presents a certain
perspective and selection of history, of values and practices.

Our party believes that the control of education should be in the hands of
parents. The Bible teaches us that our children belong to God and are
entrusted to us by Him, to bring them up in the nurture and the admonition
of the Lord.

Parents are responsible under God to oversee the teachers, the textbooks
and the syllabuses that will shape and fill their minds for 12 years of
teaching. All parents must be involved in the governing structures of their
local schools and take an active role in the education of the young
according to biblical principles.

We support the culture of learning and teaching, but a culture of learning
cannot adequately be instilled in our children if classrooms are taken over
by disorder, and teachers refuse to teach.

The question we need some clarity on is whether education is a right or a
privilege. I tend to believe that it is more than just these. Education is
an unconditional responsibility to impart knowledge and values from one
generation to the next. The Bible teaches that. I quote:


  You shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in
  your house, when you walk by the way, while you lie down, and when you
  rise up.

So, it refers to values, norms and standards.

Education is an ongoing process which involves all sectors of a society for
the benefit of all its citizens. Educational principles are carried over to
be utilised to promote life and development. Education is a social ethic in
responsibility demanding equitable distributive governance with the intent
to establish responsible citizenship.

I wish to list four standards of education which will impact on the hearts
and the minds of our children. The first standard is excellence. Education
is the transmitter for promoting human dignity and enhance human creativity
or generally speaking to nurture within humanity a certain quality of
enablement. Standards of excellence is essentially implementing the best
methods and assistance to develop the highest possible qualities innate to
an individual's capacity. Anything less is degradation of the human's image
as God intends it to be.

The second standard is accessibility to education. Education represents the
glory of knowledge and wisdom and the withholding of this splendour from
any human being is to deny God's work within the development of an
individual. To have access to education is thus an undeniable right, and
the withdrawing of this right is unlawful and criminal.

The School Register of Needs Survey has brought to light the shocking
disparities and educational backlogs which plaque our nation. This should
not be the problem of Government alone, but all institutions, including the
Church, should address this. [Interjections.]

Mr N J GOGOTYA: Mr Chairperson, is the hon member prepared to take a
question on what he said: ``All these churches during the age of christian
apartheid?''

Mr L M GREEN: Unfortunately, I only have one minute left, and I would like
to finish my speech.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: You may proceed, hon member.

Mr L M GREEN: All education programmes must affect the drive that supports
character building and give rise to reasonable expectations of positive
development and change. Education that is not effective in generating
growth in an individual or society is wasteful and misdirected.

The next standard of education is ownership of education. Education should
be based on experience and the methodology of human social development.
People must feel a sense of oneness with the roots and process of the
educational framework they are involved with. They should be participants
in the evolution of the educational process.

Let us talk a bit about results and outcomes. Education is value based. It
should also be independent, yet interrelational to the norms and standards
of a person or people. Its philosophical roots stand within the activities
and milieu of a person or society's experiences. But these roots are not
necessarily dictated by such experiences. In other words, educational
processes and outcomes should be inextricably intertwined with the moral
norms and values of our society. Yet, under close scrutiny, the signs
thereof should be traced to an independent and universal root index. If we
truly want quality and better education for our children, let us involve
all our parents and restore order and discipline.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, hon members of the National
Assembly, I was looking forward to this debate, because last year the
department published the Values in Education document, which is the first
of its kind anywhere in the world, to encourage a debate on what kind of
value systems should apply as our school system is evolving and changing
with greater integration.

I must confess, therefore, that there was some disappointment about this
debate. And it began with Mrs Southgate's extraordinary essay on the kind
of school and value system we had, in a kind of giggly, school-mistressy
sort of way. She turned to some obscure socialist writers. When we talk
about capturing the hearts and minds of children, we do not mean the
sinister intelligence and propaganda efforts through which the apartheid
regime attempted, with laughably little effect, to convert our people en
masse to support apartheid and to make them cheerleaders of their own
oppression.
That is where we should have started off. That was an attempt to capture
the minds and hearts, as they regrettably did under the guise of Christian
National Education. It did not work then. Therefore, we are now here to
discuss a new and happier battle for the hearts and minds of our youth. We
are here to counterbalance loose talk about a lost generation, and to
ensure that a new generation does not go astray.

It is this battle that we are talking about, which is part of a broader
process. It takes within its sweep the large subjects of postapartheid
history, with the visible processes of facing up to our past, which began
with our Constitution, then continued with the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, the Human Rights Commission conference on racism, and
progressed further this year with the world conference we held on a global
scale, reflecting what that famous historian W E B Dubois meant when he
said that the problem of the twentieth century is a problem of the colour
line.

I would like to say to Gen Viljoen that we have to learn about the past
without being obsessed, so that our children can understand a value system
of nonracialism and nonsexism. Therefore, when we talk of the battle for
the hearts and minds of our youth, let us not relapse into the notions of
that old battle, ie the sinister mind control that apartheid and Christian
nationalism tried to orchestrate, and failed. Also, let us not reduce this
to a parochial exercise in righteous and evangelical fervour with naïve
attempts at legislating moral hygiene and so on, as it were.

I would like to say to Mrs Southgate that our ethos must be more open, more
tolerant and more understanding than that. Having said all that, I would
like to add that we must be very careful, because when we begin with
certain dogmas, we may reproduce, in the future, the very things we are
against, and particularly the extraordinary things we do not talk about,
such as the amount of precocious sexual activity that takes place. The
first ever survey that was carried out revealed the amount of exploitation
of women and girls that takes place and that one in three sexually active
boys and one in six girls, I believe, can demand sex, even if their partner
does not want to have it.

This is the reality of our country. The extraordinary amount of abuse and
activity that takes place is not invented by the movies or books, but by
us, because we are not prepared to be honest with ourselves. We put piety
before the interests of our young people. Therefore, we must forever
challenge the entrenched social and moral authorities that gained a hold in
this country through force of arms and values that are the opposite of
humane. We must promote a spirit of questioning and enquiry, a readiness to
interrogate authority and dogma which seems to conflict with fundamental
human rights.

They banned books. We should not ban books. They took the name of God not
merely in vain, but actually in pursuit of an earthbound damnation. They
created a normal and political hell on earth, especially on Africa's
southern tip, and they did this in the name of God. Look at the
constitution before 1994. [Applause.]

We should be careful how we invoke divine ends. We must beware of what we
do in public policy as self-appointed spokespersons of divinity, and of
those who travel this way. They developed a kind of Taliban state of mind,
which sought to destroy innocence in the guise of moral re-armament. Our
politics are not dogmatically secular. Our Constitution's preamble states:
May God protect our people. Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika is very much part of our
anthem and our ethos. The Constitution, full of the ethical values that
drove our liberation, does not prescribe the confessional ideology of a
single church. The Constitution must be embraced in its entirety, it must
become part of our lives. It provides the core values that should inform
our national ideology.

We should never forget what our Constitution tells us. We must not be
selective. We are the same, with the right to be the same as far as
political rights are concerned. The Constitution also invokes the
fundamental principle that we also have the right to be different from each
other in our belief systems that many be expressed through religion, in our
language, culture and sexual orientation. Yet, no one compels us to be
different. No one compels anyone, for instance, to have an abortion, to
read erotic books, to listen to obscure music or to watch Yizo Yizo on
television. These are choices we make and the Constitution allows us to
make a choice. [Laughter.]

We should remember that when people say we should have rights with
responsibilities, it is a cop-out. Most of our people, as I was trying to
show, are humiliated in shameful initiation ceremonies in schools, nogal in
our places of highest learning; not in one, but many universities, where
the barbaric system of violence, humiliation and alcohol has destroyed at
least one young man's life in the last few days.

So we must talk about rights first. And when recognition of these rights
takes place, the responsibility comes in a sane and civilised society. Our
children must learn to take responsibility for their actions, to think for
themselves and not to be afraid to confront the challenges that face us in
our changing society. Neither can our children be weak or hide behind
religion and other belief systems, and not put right what is currently
going wrong in our society. Neither they nor we can afford to blindly put
our political trust in the hands of a single political or religious party.

We need to ensure that we instil in our children and youth a common set of
values not entirely sanitised, not like the milk that has no taste or
flavour. We may want to have a homogenous society without making a
sanitised society. We should neither subscribe by any faith, nor be
diminished by chauvinism.
Of course religion plays an important part in the lives of the majority of
our people. But no single religion - or for that matter any absence of
religion - in our diverse land, can offset the need for a specific system
of values to which we can all subscribe.

In our private lives, we must subscribe to the most fundamental values. But
in our public and secular lives, we have to work out a common set of values
- and this is directed at Gen Constand Viljoen - that does not destroy,
limit or circumscribe the basic values that one may believe in. So, rather
than seeking to capture our children's hearts and minds, we must reject
that. Instead of imprisoning them in a set mould, we should be seeking to
liberate them from the tyranny of authoritarianism, oppression,
superstition and peer pressure, particularly sexual behaviour.

We want our children, particularly girls, to feel free from the threats of
sexual abuse and violence and the scourge of harassment and abuse. I am
sorry that the public representatives and our moral leaders do not play a
bigger part in ensuring a protection of the innocence of our people, the
right of our young girls and women to say: ``No! No! No!'' So, we must not
capture anyone. We should protect their innocence, and this can only happen
when we teach our children through the precept, and more importantly,
through the example of our own behaviour, to respect and value others
regardless of race, gender or creed.

That is the world and the kind of value system we want. We must promote
that, not in the sense of false pride, but as part of the achievement of
our new society. This is not the same thing as arrogance. Arrogance is a
reaction and pride is an action. This kind of moral regeneration, the RDP
of the soul that Mr Mandela spoke of, is very much part of the value system
that should hold us together; a lot of pride, with the new patriotism which
is the direct opposite of chauvinism and xenophobia.

I commend this House and the ACDP for beginning this debate. It is only the
beginning of the debate and I hope that we can, in a year's time, take into
account the enormous intellectual, moral fibre that exists in our society
to build and create a culture in South Africa where we cherish all the
children of the nation equally. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 17:26.

         and their staffs, for their presence and contributions during the
         hearings. A list containing the names of those who made oral
         submission is included in part D of this Report.


     B.     Overview of 2001-02 Budget


         The Minister of Finance presented the 2001-02 Budget as a turning
         point in South Africa's fiscal priorities. After several years
         during which the nation's macro-economic fundamentals were aligned
         through fiscal discipline, this Budget now begins to move fiscal
         policy forward to the next stage of focusing on the micro-economic
         priorities that are so important to growing our economy.


         1. Macro-economic outlook


              The National Treasury has predicted stronger economic growth
              and declining inflation over the medium-term. However, the
              economy remains vulnerable to external shocks. The two major
              concerns reported to the Committee were the potential global
              repercussions of a protracted US economic downturn affecting
              South Africa's economy and the risk a rise in oil prices could
              hold for inflation and economic growth.


              (1) GDP growth


                  The National Treasury has predicted a relatively good
                  economic forecast for South Africa over the medium term.
                  The basic underpinnings of the Budget's assumptions are
                  that we will experience an average growth rate of 3,5%
                  for the next three years. This is supported by several
                  factors, including stronger growth on the demand side,
                  further productivity improvements on the supply side, and
                  real growth in government spending. Stronger household
                  spending, improving domestic and foreign business
                  confidence, positive long-term capital flows, growth in
                  investment, and a competitive currency, are the key
                  assumptions underlying this anticipated growth in
                  domestic consumption and exports.


                  Annual GDP Growth Rate


                  * 3,0% in 2000
                  * 3,5% in 2001
                  * 3,7% in 2002
                  * 3,3% in 2003


              (2) Inflation


                  After peaking late last year, CPIX inflation is also
                  expected to decline to within the government's target
                  range of 3,0% to 6,0% by 2002:
                  Annual Growth in CPIX Inflation


                  * 7,7% in 2000
                  * 6,6% in 2001
                  * 5,3% in 2002
                  * 4,7% in 2003


              (3) Other economic indicators


                  The Treasury reported that last year -


                  (a)  capital market interest rates fell, according to the
                       January 2001 R150, to around 11,9%;


                  (b)  the rand lost about 9,5% of its value against the US
                       dollar;


                  (c)  non-gold exports rose from 11,5% of GDP in 1990 to
                       18,8% in 2000; and


                  (d)  real merchandise imports also rose from 12,0% in
                       1990 to 19,8% in 2000.


         2. Projected Budget Framework


              While continuing to maintain the fiscal discipline that helped
              to bring South Africa to the current state of macro-economic
              stability, this Budget expresses the view that we are now
              ready to undertake a more expansionary economic policy with a
              greater emphasis on micro-economic issues. The primary
              outcomes of this are realised in increased expenditures and
              tax relief, largely due to savings realised from a diminishing
              deficit.


              (1) Increased expenditures


                  Spending on public services has increased significantly
                  from the projections made in the 2000-01 Budget. Fiscal
                  Year 2001-02 spending is increasing by 9,9% from last
                  year. Over the next three years this spending on non-
                  interest items will experience real growth of some 3,8%
                  each year. In rand terms, this means that spending will
                  be R10,2 billion greater in 2001-02 and R16 billion
                  greater in 2002-03 than projected in the 2000-01 Budget.


                  Medium-Term Total Expenditures


                  * R258,3 billion in 2001/02
                  * R277,3 billion in 2002/03
                  * R297,5 billion in 2003/04


                  The money for this enhanced spending is made available
                  from increased revenue receipts and declining debt
                  service costs, brought about by the reduction of deficits
                  and the utilisation of proceeds from the restructuring of
                  State assets.


                  The Minister's Budget Speech lists the basic public
                  expenditure objectives in South Africa:


                  (a)  Economic growth and job creation.


                  (b)  Reducing inequality and promoting social
                       development.
                  (c)  Strengthening safety and justice.


                  Highlights of increased spending over the medium-term:


                  *    Local government restructuring and delivery of basic
                       services - R2,6 billion.


                  *    Increase in old age/disability grants by R30 to R570
                       per month.


                  *    Increase in child support by R10 to R110 per month.


                  *    Provincial Social Service delivery - R16 billion.


                  *    Criminal Justice - R4 billion for more personnel,
                       vehicles and salary.


                  *    Supplementary infrastructure investment and
                       maintenance - R7,8 billion.


                  *    SARS and Foreign Affairs - R2 billion.


              (2) Lower taxes


                  In addition to the greater expenditure on public
                  services, the fiscal discipline of the last several years
                  has allowed net tax reductions of R 9,1 billion. This is
                  largely realised in decreases in the personal income tax
                  for those making under R80 000 per year, but also in
                  forms of several targeted tax reductions intended to spur
                  growth by stimulating household spending and investment
                  in certain economic sectors.


                  R12,8 billion in tax cuts and incentives:


                  (a)  Personal income tax reductions principally to those
                       earning under R80 000 per year. This includes no
                       personal income tax for workers making less than R23
                       000 per year (R8,3 billion).


                  (b)  Wage tax incentive (R600 million).


                  (c)  Targeted incentives for industrial projects meeting
                       specific criteria (R3 billion) over four years.


                  (d)  Tax privileges for small businesses (R40 million).


                  (e)  Reduction in estate duty and donations tax by 20%
                       (R51 million).


                  (f)  Elimination of VAT on paraffin (R400 million).


                  (g)  Extension of diesel fuel concession to the primary
                       production sector for off-road diesel consumption
                       (R417 million).


                  (h)  Raising the exemption in interest and dividend
                       income from R3 000 to R4 000, and to R5 000 for those
                       over 65 (R200 million).


                  And some tax increases and revenue-raising tax policy
                  changes:


                  (a)  Increase levies on alcohol and tobacco (R779
                       million).


                  (b)  A below inflation rate increase in fuel levy (R363
                       million).


                  (c)  Increase road accident fund levy (R437 million).


                  (d)  Increase in skills levy by 0,5% to 1,0%.


                  (e)  Capital gains tax to become effective on 1/10/01.


                  (f)  Closing income tax loopholes.


                  (g)  Review tax on banks.


                  (h)  Unbundling transactions.


                  (i)  Change in Eskom's tax status.


                  Revenue collection exceeded expectations in 1999-2000 by
                  R7,7 billion and are expected to exceed 2000-01 estimates
                  by R3 billion, even with the new tax cuts.


                  Estimated medium-term revenue collection:


                  * R233,4 billion in 2001/02
                  * R252,9 billion in 2002/03
                  * R273,1 billion in 2003/04


              (3) Diminishing deficits


                  Fiscal discipline, declining annual deficits,
                  restructuring of State assets, reorganisation of
                  government liabilities and anticipated economic growth
                  will contribute to the decline of our net national loan
                  debt in proportion to the size of the economy, reducing
                  the debt burden from 48% of GDP in 1996 to 44,3 in 2001,
                  eventually falling to 39,1% in 2004.
                  The Budget deficit as a percentage of GDP was 2,4% last
                  year, and will be -


                  * 2,5% GDP in 2001/02
                  * 2,3% GDP in 2002/03
                  * 2,1% GDP in 2003/04


                  The benefits of this can already be seen in lower debt
                  servicing costs, releasing funds for greater public
                  service expenditure and tax reductions. This decline in
                  government borrowing has the potential to stimulate the
                  economy by increasing the overall savings rate and making
                  the South African economy more attractive to investment.
                  All in all, debt service costs are expected to fall from
                  5,5% of GDP in 1999-2000 to 4,4% of GDP in 2003-04.


         3. Better documentation


              The Treasury's initial efforts to bring the Budget
              documentation in line with the requirements of the PFMA are
              commendable. The Estimate of Expenditure is a fresh start,
              with government departments moving towards an output-based
              budgeting system and promoting public sector accountability.
              While recognising that it is still in its early stages, there
              is a definite need to improve the way in which outputs,
              outcomes and measurable objectives are classified. A dialogue
              between departments and the corresponding committees in
              Parliament should lead to expenditure statements that make
              clear the government's objectives, policies and priorities and
              assist Parliament in its oversight responsibility.


              The need for changes in the focus of national economic data
              surveys to bring them in line with the current realities of
              the economy was highlighted by the Black Business Council
              (BBC) and Dr Iraj Abedian of Standard Bank, with particular
              reference to the inclusion of data on the informal and
              tertiary sectors.


         4. Budget reform


              Section 77 of the Constitution mandates that legislation be
              enacted giving Parliament the power to amend money bills. In
              protest against the lack of progress on this and other Budget
              reform issues, Cosatu, for the fourth year in a row, has opted
              not to appear at the Committee's hearings. In a letter
              addressed to the Chairperson, Mr Neil Coleman, the head of
              Cosatu's parliamentary office, has called for the Committee to
              "ensure the urgent tabling of an adequate Money Bills
              Amendment Procedure Bill." Additionally, BusinessMap called
              for further procedural improvements in the Budget process,
              with more parliamentary involvement prior to the tabling of
              the Budget, thus making the Budget more meaningful for all
              South Africans.


              In response to these comments, the Committee agreed to send a
              letter to the Speaker requesting advice on whether such
              legislation must be tabled by the Minister of Finance, or
              whether it can be tabled by a committee or any Member of
              Parliament.
     C.     Main priorities of Budget


         The main priorities that emerged from the Committee's hearings on
         the 2001-02 Budget were the following: Ongoing restructuring and
         reduction of public sector debt; economic growth and job creation;
         poverty alleviation; and revenue reform.


         1. Stabilising debt and reducing Budget deficit: Contributing to
              lower interest rates and fiscal sustainability


              Figures supplied by the National Treasury show that the strict
              fiscal discipline practiced over the last several Budgets has
              finally brought about much needed economic stabilisation.
              Limited government spending and higher revenue receipts have
              allowed the government to steadily bring down the rate of
              deficit spending. Additionally, the nearly R19 billion in
              revenue already realised from the restructuring of public
              enterprises has contributed to reducing the deficit.


              This programme of stabilisation has had multiple beneficial
              effects. Firstly, it has helped to bring down long-term
              interest rates, lowering the cost of capital. It has also
              emphasised to the international investor community that South
              Africa's economy is stable and its management is steady and
              disciplined. Most importantly, the success of the
              stabilisation programme now permits the focus of the Budget
              debate to shift to micro-economic issues by bringing the debt
              servicing costs downward and releasing more funds for
              increased public service expenditure and lower taxes.


              The business sector's evidence before the Committee lauded the
              "exemplary" management of the national debt. Die Afrikaanse
              Handelsinstituut (AHI) pointed out that for the first time in
              decades the management of debt is under control. Hovever, Dr
              Abedian noted that while macro-economic stabilisation has been
              achieved and the fundamentals are in place, economic
              leadership is needed to capitalise on this in terms of
              transforming it into increased employment and poverty
              reduction. BusinessMap also suggested that there was space for
              more expansion in public spending policies.


              (1) Advantages of managing debt down


                  According to the National Treasury, the steady reduction
                  of the Budget deficit has freed up over R10 billion in
                  the medium-term for additional Public Service
                  expenditure. As recently as three years ago, in the 1999-
                  2000 financial year, interest on the debt consumed over
                  20% of government spending; now that figure is down to
                  16,4% and declining. The South African Chamber of
                  Business (Sacob) has endorsed the Treasury's projection
                  of R10 billion being made available as a result of debt
                  reduction. Evidence was given that this estimate may even
                  be slightly too conservative.


                  Besides making more money available in the Budget for
                  Public Service expenditure, there are additional macro-
                  economic benefits realised from reducing the government
                  debt. It will contribute to the lowering of long-term
                  interest rates, allow the government to have a "cushion"
                  for bad economic times, and enhance international
                  investor confidence.


              (2) Restructuring of State assets


                  A key aspect of paying down the debt has been the
                  restructuring of State assets. To date, the Treasury
                  shows that nearly R19 billion has been realised from
                  asset restructuring, of which nearly R12,5 billion has
                  been paid to the exchequer for debt reduction.


                  In the next year the Treasury estimates that R18 billion
                  will be realised from the further restructuring of State
                  assets. The most significant portions of this will be
                  made up from the IPO of Telkom, sale of M-Cell shares,
                  and revenue from the restructuring of Denel and Sasria.
                  In view of the lower than expected receipts from recent
                  restructuring programmes, much attention was given to the
                  Treasury's estimate during the hearings. While the
                  general feeling was that the R18 billion was a reasonable
                  target, the AHI felt that a more realistic figure would
                  be R15 billion. On the contrary, Sacob and BusinessMap
                  endorsed the Treasury's view that the R18 billion
                  estimate was a rather conservative one. The primary
                  concern was how much the estimate relied upon the Telkom
                  IPO, especially considering the weakened state of the
                  global telecommunications market.


                  The BBC wanted to ensure that black empowerment remains a
                  priority during government restructuring, with special
                  emphasis on small businesses.


         2. Impact on economic growth and job creation


              The 2001-02 Budget addresses these two issues through three
              primary approaches: Investment in capital and government
              administrative infrastructure, targeted tax incentives to
              promote growth and job creation, and investment in human
              resources to build the supply of skilled workers in South
              Africa.


              Infrastructure investment


              (1) Increased capital infrastructure investment


                  The primary aspect of this fiscal programme is the R7,8
                  billion promised over the medium-term for new
                  infrastructure, infrastructure maintenance and
                  rehabilitation required in response to recent disasters.
                  The government sees such a programme as reinforcing the
                  foundations on which sustainable growth is built. Such
                  infrastructure investment will lower the costs of
                  production, transportation, and communication. Also, the
                  spending will directly contribute to job creation. This
                  investment was welcomed by all, both in terms of short-
                  term job creation and improving infrastructural assets.
                  Capital expenditure by the government has been decreasing
                  significantly, so this reversal is welcome.


                  There were some concerns about this ambitious programme,
                  largely directed at the capacity of the government to
                  fully deliver. For example, Idasa's submission to the
                  Committee particularly emphasises concerns with the
                  capacity to spend these funds through the medium-term.
                  They point out that there has been incomplete planning
                  regarding the destination of the funds and that national
                  and provincial departments are still significantly
                  underspending their budgets. This is especially of great
                  concern since the largest allocations under this
                  programme are going to departments which have not been
                  able to spend their budgets. Similarly, the BBC raised a
                  note of caution regarding the capacity of local
                  government to deliver sustainable employment through this
                  mechanism, on the basis of the poor performance of
                  similar projects previously implemented.


                  In response to such questions from the Committee, the
                  National Treasury emphasised the use of conditional and
                  matching grants with local and provincial governments to
                  encourage the proper spending of the money. Also, most of
                  the money is going to be spent in the outer years of the
                  medium-term, giving governments adequate time to prepare
                  and plan the implementation of the programme.


              (2) Improving government administrative capacity


                  Capital infrastructure is not the only infrastructure
                  investment that the government has a responsibility to
                  undertake. The government has seen the need to address
                  weaknesses in the administrative infrastructure in order
                  to alleviate service delivery problems. Also, government
                  institutions have to be made more efficient in performing
                  their duties in support of economic growth and job
                  creation. This problem is a combination of the lack of
                  capacity and inadequate funds. Major problems pointed out
                  to the Committee were the failures in Home Affairs to
                  allow for a more simplified way of bringing in non-South
                  African skilled workers who could contribute to the
                  growth of the economy.


                  The primary allocations to address these problems are as
                  follows:


                  (a)  R4 billion over the medium term to address
                       crime/criminal justice.


                  (b)  R2 billion for Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs and
                       SARS.


                  (c)  R2,4 billion extra for local government to increase
                       infrastructure spending.
                  These expenditures are intended to improve the government
                  administration in criminal justice, streamline the much
                  maligned process of granting work permits to non-South
                  Africans, improve revenue collection and assistance to
                  taxpayers, and help local governments cope with the
                  additional administrative and governance responsibilities
                  facing them.


                  Tax incentives


                  There was a general welcome for the South African revenue
                  system coming broadly in line with international norms
                  and addressing outstanding equity issues, although it was
                  recommended that further simplification would enhance
                  effectiveness in terms of both revenue collection and
                  management. This section addresses the evidence given on
                  tax incentives intended to spur growth in the economy and
                  job creation. Further comments on the tax reforms
                  outlined in the 2001-02 Budget are discussed under the
                  tax reform section.


                  Much of the tax relief was targeted to the extremely poor
                  and those who earn less than R80 000 a year. These will
                  be more fully discussed under the poverty alleviation
                  section, but, according to the National Treasury, part of
                  the advantage of lowering personal income tax and other
                  incentives, such as zeroing the VAT on illuminating
                  paraffin, is to encourage higher household savings rate,
                  or at least a further reduction in household
                  indebtedness. There is also a belief that these tax
                  breaks could lead to an increase in consumer spending and
                  demand. All of these results would hopefully increase the
                  growth in the economy. Pierre du Toit, formerly of the
                  Katz Commission, disagreed, arguing that such tax breaks
                  do not affect savings, but just move them around. Others
                  pointed out that previous tax decreases were followed by
                  significant reductions in household debt, although a fair
                  amount of last year's decrease was consumed by rising
                  transport costs. The AHI also said that the rising tax
                  burden in South Africa severely affected the savings
                  rate, and it is therefore good to reverse this trend.


              (3) Investment incentives


                  The National Treasury, through extensive discussions with
                  the Department of Trade and Industry, has agreed to R3
                  billion in tax allowances for strategic investments over
                  the next four years. The intent is to encourage both
                  foreign and domestic investment in the economy. Included
                  in the programme are initial investment allowances of 50%
                  or 100% for strategic projects. The allowance will be
                  available for the first three years following the
                  investment. These incentives will be allocated by an
                  adjudication committee on the basis of qualitative and
                  quantitative criteria defining strategic investment
                  purposes.
                  There was some significant skepticism regarding such
                  incentives. Mr du Toit commented that they should be
                  implemented from the bottom up, encouraging growth and
                  development in small and medium businesses, and not to
                  forget about targeting domestic investment.


                  The BBC was also skeptical of such incentives, concerned
                  that the emphasis would not be on black empowerment. The
                  BBC feels that black empowerment should be primary
                  criteria for receipt of such investment. The AHI
                  commented that it is possible that the money could be
                  better spent on further infrastructure improvement.


                  Mr du Toit did give some criteria of giving such tax
                  incentives: They should be legitimate and necessary, have
                  an immediately foreseeable impact pass a reasonable
                  cost/benefit analysis, and be kept under control. Also,
                  he was more in favour of giving tax incentives as opposed
                  to cash subsidies. However, Sacob pointed out that tax
                  incentives.


              (4) Wage incentives


                  The National Treasury has set aside R600 million for 2001-
                  02 for economically and administratively efficient tax
                  measures that will encourage job creation by reducing the
                  cost of hiring new workers and of offering learnerships.
                  This will have positive effects on other government
                  programmes and ensure their benefits are more widely
                  available. It should be fully operational on 1 October
                  2001.


                  Most of those who appeared before the Committee were
                  reluctant to offer extensive commentary because most
                  details about the programme were not yet available.
                  However, a number of commentators expressed reservations
                  about the efficacy of such tax incentives and whether it
                  was wise to add more taxes.


              (5) Small business


                  R40 million has been set aside for an accelerated
                  depreciation scheme for small businesses, allowing the
                  full cost of an investment to be deducted in the year it
                  was purchased. Ideally, this proposal will improve the
                  cash flow of growing small businesses, enhancing job
                  creation in this sector.


                  Those who commented before the Committee, welcomed this
                  relief for small business, but a few other points were
                  brought to the Committee's attention regarding issues
                  affecting small businesses. For instance, the AHI pointed
                  out that the burden of compliance for small businesses is
                  often quite high. While additional tax relief is welcome,
                  it also adds complexity to calculating the taxes for such
                  businesses. There are some fears that this additional
                  complexity may be stifling growth in this area. Mr Hassan
                  Kajie requested that small business be allowed to use a
                  cash basis, rather than accrual accounting, which will
                  reduce their need for chartered accountants and should
                  speed up the processing of tax returns.


                  The BBC is concerned that the Budget really is not
                  helping most small businesses. A key concern of theirs is
                  that many small businesses have a turnover above R1
                  million, but are left out of most relief measures. They
                  argue that the cap on small businesses should be raised
                  to R2 million.


              (6) Diesel fuel reduction for primary producers


                  Significant relief on diesel concessions will be granted
                  to primary producers in the agricultural, forestry and
                  mining sectors. This concession will come into effect on
                  4 July 2001, cutting the tax burden on diesel fuel by
                  42,1 cents a litre, or 41,5% of the total tax burden.


                  There was some concern that the concession will come too
                  late this year to benefit farmers in winter rainfall
                  areas. The concern was noted by the Treasury, but the
                  response was that time was needed to ensure that adequate
                  administration was in place to minimise the risk of
                  fraud.


              (7) Additional business concerns about taxes


                  Most of this discussion is dealt with under the tax
                  relief Section, but there were some concerns from those
                  who gave evidence about the economic impact of certain
                  tax reforms and some desired changes that were not
                  realised in this Budget.


                  Many in the business community expressed concern that the
                  corporate tax rate was too high and should be brought
                  down to be more in line with those of other emerging
                  markets. However, concern was also expressed that if
                  South Africa started cutting corporate taxes, they would
                  be engaging in a destructive "race to the bottom" of
                  corporate tax rates. The National Treasury argued that
                  South Africa's corporate taxes were in line with
                  international norms. There were also concerns about the
                  implementation of capital gains tax (CGT), and the AHI
                  expressed continued unhappiness with the STC.


                  Some commentators noted that the difference between the
                  highest PIT rate of 42% and the corporate tax rate of
                  37,8% (when including STC) created a situation for tax
                  arbitrage. They argued that a cut in PIT at the highest
                  level would bring this more in line. Also, the AHI felt
                  that there was need to re-examine the South African
                  highest marginal PIT and move it to within international
                  norms, where it should kick in at around R1 million
                  instead of the current R215 000.


              (8) Human resource investment


                  Limited skills levels within the labour market are
                  inhibiting growth prospects, and excluding many from
                  employment prospects in the growing tertiary sector. Many
                  commented that there is an urgent need for increased
                  investment in strategic skills development, in line with
                  the changing requirements of the economy. Dr Abedian
                  noted that this ongoing reduction in demand for labour is
                  a structural feature of the economy, particularly in the
                  unskilled sector. Hence specific measures are required to
                  stimulate both economic growth and job creation.


              (9) Skills development levy


                  This Budget sees the increase in the skills development
                  levy from 0,5% to 1%, effective 1 April 2001. This is
                  expected to raise collections from R1,3 billion in 2000-
                  01 to R2,8 billion in 2001-02.


                  The increase in the skills levy received a mixed
                  reaction. Concern was expressed about its effectiveness
                  and about current mechanisms for delivering labour skills
                  development. R430 million was not claimed last year, and
                  it is feared that many companies are merely seeing this
                  as another tax and not taking advantage of the
                  opportunities it presents for increased training
                  subsidies. Idasa also fears that the skills development
                  programme focuses on those who are already employed,
                  occurring at the expense of the poor, illiterate and
                  unemployed.


                  Also, simplified incentives for skills training are
                  needed (in place of the current complex mechanism of
                  claiming back training costs which actually acts as a
                  disincentive to utilise the funds because of the
                  unclaimed administrative costs), and training should
                  focus on strategic skills currently required by the
                  economy.


                  Other areas where skills need to be addressed, are by
                  increasing investment in improving basic human capital
                  through support to the education system, and while these
                  initiatives will deliver a skilled labour force in the
                  medium term, the importation of foreign expertise needs
                  to be facilitated in the short term by streamlining the
                  process of obtaining work permits and visas for skilled
                  workers.


         3. Linkage between poverty alleviation and growth in South African
              economy


              Throughout the hearings a recurring theme was how South Africa
              can break free of the relatively constrained growth
              experienced now, and anticipated in the medium term, and
              achieve the needed growth rates of near 6%, as anticipated by
              GEAR. The discussion between the Committee and those who
              appeared before it is summarised hereunder.


              GEAR has successfully achieved stability in terms of macro-
              economic fundamentals. However, the South African economy has
              undergone a fundamental structural transformation in recent
              decades in terms of sectoral change, labour skills profile and
              production technology. The consequence of this transformation
              is the rise in importance of the tertiary sector, which Dr
              Abedian argues now generates 65% of the national income. This
              shift has created a structural reduction in demand for
              unskilled labour, and increased demand for skilled labour.
              Given this profile, it is likely that poverty and inequality
              will increase through rising levels of structural
              unemployment, even within the context of ongoing aggregate
              growth. Major investment in skills training and employment
              generation are now the key policy challenges required to
              capitalise on the achievements of GEAR.


              The labour force is not adequately skilled to meet the
              changing demands of the transformed economy. There is an
              urgent need for investment in effective training and education
              in order to ensure that the labour force can provide the
              economy with the skills it requires, and also to enable the
              workforce to participate in the economy. Pending the
              development of a skilled workforce it will be necessary to
              recruit skilled labour from overseas.


              There is also a need to create employment for those suffering
              from structural unemployment in order to prevent the growth of
              inequality between those participating in the economy and
              those excluded. One contribution to this objective will be the
              large-scale public funded infrastructural projects proposed in
              the Budget. However, the capacity of provincial governments to
              implement the projects will be a major consideration in terms
              of the effectiveness of this strategy for reducing
              unemployment. Increases in infrastructural spending are,
              nevertheless, a necessary rather than sufficient condition for
              addressing poverty and inequality, and an integrated medium-
              term poverty reduction programme is required in response to
              the profound challenges of growing inequality.


              Socio-economic factors related to poverty and inequality have
              a negative impact on investor confidence and inhibit prospects
              for future growth. Concerns regarding the business risk
              associated with investing in an economically polarised society
              (as manifested in terms of crime rates, political stability,
              etc) combined with concerns regarding the low skills base of
              the labour force limit both domestic and foreign investment.


              Uncertainty regarding the government's future investment
              strategy, following the attainment of the main GEAR targets,
              and concerns about future policy on the redistribution of
              capital investments and assets, are compounding low investor
              confidence.


              There are also some concerns that affect South Africa's growth
              from an international perspective. The Minister, in his Budget
              Speech, alluded to the inequitable trade practices of the
              developed world in relation to developing countries. These
              include the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union
              and other countries' similar protectionist measures. Other
              concerns are the perception of South Africa, and Africa as a
              whole, in the world community. Political, social and economic
              troubles in our region have ramifications that affect economic
              growth and stability throughout our continent. This
              contributes to the perception amongst many foreign investors
              that the risk of doing business in South Africa is not
              outweighed by its potential returns. Restoring investor
              confidence needs to be a national priority.


              Decisive leadership is now required to address these issues,
              from both the government and the business sector. In order to
              consolidate the gains of macro-economic stability, it is
              critical to develop mechanisms to promote trust between the
              government, labour and business, and to develop a new
              framework for co-operation based around the creation of new
              jobs, rather than the preservation of old ones.


              It is also critical to develop the capacity of local
              government to generate an environment conducive to economic
              growth and employment through infrastructural investment in
              order to address the issue of structural unemployment that is
              arising from the transformation of the national economy.


              In order to capitalise on the achievements of macro-economic
              stabilisation, both domestic and international confidence are
              now critical to promote increased investment. This can only be
              achieved by addressing the socio-economic issues outlined
              above.


         4. Poverty alleviation


              Poverty alleviation has received a significant amount of
              attention in the 2001-02 Budget. It is specifically targeted
              with certain expenditures and tax reductions. It also is
              indirectly addressed through overall efforts to grow the
              economy and create new jobs, as outlined in the previous
              section. Significant additional spending is going to be made
              available to directly attack poverty in South Africa, and this
              will be coupled with over R8 billion in tax relief directly to
              the low- and middle-income taxpayers.


              While many suggestions on how to improve service delivery to
              the poor came from independent submissions or the NGO
              community, the business community also expressed a concern
              over increasing income disparity and the negative effect this
              has on investor confidence, and hence investment prospects.


              (1) Increased social services expenditures


                  The National Treasury has made R16 billion available to
                  provinces to enhance social service delivery. R1,5
                  billion per year over the medium term will be spent on
                  specific allocations under the poverty relief and jobs
                  summit allocations, and over R400 million will be spent
                  on fighting AIDS this coming year.


              (2) Increase of social grants


                  Old-age and disability grants are to be raised by R30 to
                  R570 per month and child support grants will grow by 10%
                  to R110. Idasa commented that an additional R10 per month
                  would be needed for the old age grants and disability
                  grants to outstrip inflation. Also, concerns were
                  expressed that these grants are not yet permanently
                  inflation-linked. The Treasury is waiting to see what the
                  total uptake on the grants will be (especially the child
                  support grant) before committing themselves to increases.
                  In the meantime, the MTEF allows for inflation-related
                  adjustments to these grants over the medium term.


                  Beyond these programmes, Idasa commented that other
                  direct government spending to help the poor include the
                  integrated nutrition programme, short-term relief
                  measures, funds for low-cost housing and the
                  subsidisation of public transport, and the financing of
                  local government and pricing of basic services in order
                  to provide minicipal services to poor households free of
                  charge.


                  In addition to this direct spending on poverty
                  alleviation, it is important to examine the entire
                  context of the Budget with a view to how government
                  intends to help the poor. Concentrating on economic
                  growth and job creation, largely emphasised in the
                  previous section, along with skills development and
                  education, will lead to the greatest benefits for the
                  poor.


              (3) Tax cuts to help low and middle income earners


                  By far, the largest part of the tax cuts are R8,3 billion
                  in cuts for those earning below R80 000. Also, no taxes
                  are paid by those earning under R23 000 per year. These
                  cuts were welcome by all who commented on them. There are
                  concerns that the unemployed and those employed in the
                  informal sector would not benefit.


                  Zero VAT on illuminating paraffin will return R400
                  million to the pockets of the very poor, who rely on
                  paraffin for heating, cooking and light. This was also
                  widely welcomed, with the caveat that the benefits are
                  passed on to consumers. Even the Treasury expressed
                  concern that the retailers of paraffin may not pass on
                  this reduction. This concern was mirrored by several
                  organisations, the consensus being that consumers must be
                  aware of their rights and report unscrupulous retailers
                  who do not lower prices or defy the law by charging a VAT
                  that no longer exists.


                  Finally, the fuel levies will rise below the rate of
                  inflation this year, helping to slow the increase in
                  transport costs.


              (4) Job creation


                  Job creation measures are more specifically addressed in
                  the section on economic growth and job creation. One
                  problem that the BBC highlighted, was the importance of
                  the informal sector in absorbing labour excluded from the
                  formal economy. Data regarding this sector is currently
                  inadequate and research is needed to better understand
                  the role of informal employment, and enable policy
                  development to promote employment in this sector.


              (5) Improving delivery of poverty alleviation programmes


                  A consistent complaint to the Committee was that it seems
                  that poverty is being addressed in piecemeal fashion, and
                  not with a systematic unified approach. The BBC,
                  BusinessMap, Dr Stephen Gelb and Dr Abedian all argued
                  for a more comprehensive approach to micro-economic
                  policy to address poverty alleviation. BusinessMap was
                  critical of separate funds being set up to address
                  poverty alleviation, rather than it being integrated into
                  a national strategy. Dr Abedian proposed a 10-year
                  integrated national poverty alleviation programme to
                  address both medium-term and structural aspects of
                  poverty alleviation. Idasa outlined a range of possible
                  policy instruments, including strengthening the
                  government's delivery capacity and a review of social
                  grants, adult literacy and adult education allocations to
                  enhance short-term poverty relief.


         4. Revenue reform


              Most of the tax relief measures have been discussed under the
              sections on economic growth and job creation and poverty
              alleviation, but there are other tax measures, mainly new
              policies, increases, or the desire for more reform, that
              elicited significant commentary from those who gave evidence
              before the Committee. The Treasury has commented that one of
              their objectives is to keep total revenue collections below
              25% of GDP, and all the adjustments contained within the
              Budget maintain that goal. There are also some new taxes
              proposed, including a re-examination of the tax on banks,
              extending PAYE to directors of private companies, and the
              implementation of CGT. There was substantial commentary on
              these and other tax issues, which are outlined below.


              (1) Some controversy over new taxes


                  The National Treasury has proposed a review of the tax on
                  banks. The feeling expressed by it is that banks pay less
                  than their fair share of tax, thus raising the burden on
                  other taxpayers. The issue will be examined by the
                  Treasury, also looking at the response of other
                  countries, since this is an international phenomenon. The
                  AHI opposes increasing the tax on banks. They argue that
                  most banks already pay their fair share, pointing out
                  that the four big banks pay around 22,8% in tax, while
                  the amount is not much higher for most large corporations
                  (with the notable exception of those in the retail
                  sector). They also claim that banking provides much help
                  for the economy by assisting local councils and
                  parastatals, providing financial services for South
                  Africans, and holding statutory reserves for the Reserve
                  Bank at no interest.


                  Extending PAYE to private company directors also elicited
                  much debate. David Clegg of Ernst & Young was especially
                  concerned that this would amount to an unfair taxation on
                  loans from a company. The idea is that director payments
                  are generally considered advances on end-of-year
                  remunerations. If company profits are below expectations,
                  then the directors have to reimburse the difference, so
                  in such a case this tax would essentially be a tax on a
                  loan. Mr Du Toit responded to this by suggesting that it
                  is the company accountant's responsibility to estimate
                  what are reasonable payments to directors, and thus avoid
                  such a problem.


                  The AHI argued that the fuel levy should not be
                  increased, challenging the Treasury's assertion that it
                  leads to lower fuel consumption. They argue that this is
                  untrue when there are no viable mass transit alternatives
                  in existence, and that it simply has the effect of
                  diverting a greater proportion of household spending to
                  transportation.


              (2) Need to reassess tax on retirement funds


                  There was a strong belief amongst many who gave evidence,
                  and many members, that the current system of taxing
                  retirement needed some revision. The argument that they
                  provide a disincentive to save for retirement and
                  therefore contribute to the low savings rate, was put
                  forward by Fedusa. Mr Kajie also commented that they
                  disproportionately hit the poor. The Committee reminded
                  the Treasury that there was a previous promise to re-
                  examine them, and the Director-General of Finance agreed
                  to such a re-examination within two years.


              (3) Other concerns over taxes


                  A strong plea was made by Mr Du Toit to refrain from any
                  new taxes in the short term, largely to give SARS and the
                  private sector time to adjust to all the recent changes.


                  Some put forward suggestions of a review of allowances
                  and thresholds, especially the highest marginal PIT
                  rates. One argument presented for cutting the rate from
                  42% was to help reduce the opportunity for arbitrage
                  between the highest corporate rates. Another argument was
                  that the highest marginal rate is not in line with
                  international norms, as the Treasury argues. The AHI
                  points out that it starts at R215 000, whereas if it were
                  in line with international norms it would begin at R1
                  million.


              (4) SARS doing good job on administration


                  There was a universal belief that SARS has been doing an
                  outstanding job in tax collection and in adapting to the
                  rapidly changing tax situation. The Treasury acknowledged
                  this, and also pledged an additional expenditure for SARS
                  to improve administration and prepare for significant
                  changes in collection.


                  One suggestion that many from business and tax experts
                  wanted to see implemented, was for SARS to begin the
                  practice of issuing advance written tax rulings.
