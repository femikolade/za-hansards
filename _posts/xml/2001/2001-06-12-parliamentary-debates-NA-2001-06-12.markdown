                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr D M GUMEDE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -
       (a)  President Mbeki launched the Beacon of Hope Project on  Saturday
           night;


       (b)  this ANC Youth League project targets the best performing  Grade
           12 learners, especially from underprivileged backgrounds; and


       (c)  this project offers the hope  that  those  that  work  hard  and
           sacrifice will be rewarded for their successes; and


  (2) wishes students well in their future endeavours and urges them to  be
       patriotic and to plough their skills into the country upon completion
       of their studies.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  I  shall  move  on
behalf of the DP ... [Interjections.] [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Please proceed, hon member.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes Democratic Alliance Leader, Tony Leon, back to South  Africa
       after his extremely successful visit to the United Kingdom where   he
       made impassioned pleas for foreign direct investment which could lead
       to economic development and more jobs for our people; and


  (2) expresses the hope that President Mbeki's visit to  the  UK  with  80
       businessmen will carry the process further  and  will  enhance  South
       Africa's prospects of attracting investment.

[Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the
next sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) is concerned about the state of window visibility  in  South  African
       vehicles which causes reckless driving as it  impairs  visibility  in
       respect of other vehicles, pedestrians and animals;


  (2)  is  further  concerned  that  seemingly  there  is  no  proper   law
       enforcement in respect of the overtinting of vehicle windows; and


  (3) calls upon the Department of Transport to look  seriously  into  this
       matter to curb the rate  of  accidents  on  our  roads  and  criminal
       activity  bred  behind  such  tinted  windows,   resulting   in   the
       unavailability of identikits when criminals have to be apprehended.

Ms H F MALEBANA: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the controversy-prone DA in  Cape  Town,  under  misguided
       mayor  Peter  Marais,  has  exposed  its  aversion  to  participatory
       democracy by -


       (a)  not consulting people on changing street names;


       (b)  not acting decisively on the alleged signature fraud in  support
           of the changes; and


       (c)  exposing  the  public  process  as  a  farce  since  the  city's
           departments regard it as a fait accompli, having started to  use
           the proposed new names in official documents; and


  (2) calls on -


       (a)  the police and the  Public  Protector  to  launch  an  immediate
           transparent investigation into the allegations of fraud  in  the
           process; and


       (b)  Mr Marais to drop his ill-conceived plans.

[Applause.]

Adv A H GAUM: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with great distress the comments of Dr Ike Nzo that ``criminals
       are going to cost the country much more than apartheid did'';


  (2) further notes that Dr Nzo's response to  the  devastating  impact  of
       violent crime on South African society and his own family has led him
       to plan to leave the country; and


  (3) urges President Mbeki, Minister Tshwete and Minister  Maduna  to  act
       decisively against crime and to fulfil their obligations to all South
       Africans by -


       (a)  recruiting, training and equipping  police,  and  improving  the
           administration of justice;


       (b)  getting tough against crime and criminals; and


       (c)  making South Africa a safe place to live.

Mr J T MASEKA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the concern that the master's office at the Pretoria High Court
       is battling to reduce a backlog of more than 32 000  inquiries  about
       the administration of estates;


  (2) further notes that the  Auditor-General  identified  R70  million  of
       unauthorised expenditure in the Department of Justice last year alone
       and that this department had the worst financial track record;


  (3) acknowledges that this is a direct reflection on the ANC Government's
       inability to deal with a vital part of our judiciary; and


  (4) calls upon the Minister for Justice  and  Constitutional  Development
       urgently  to  curtail  unauthorised  expenditure  and  to   implement
       constructive measures to  combat  the  backlog  of  court  cases  and
       enquiries.

Dr E E JASSAT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the editor of noseweek magazine has apologised for an  editorial
           described as ``a disgrace'' by  the  Western  Cape  Director  of
           Public Prosecutions; and


       (b)  as a result of his apology  Martin  Weltz  has  narrowly  missed
           criminal prosecution;


  (2) believes that the  media's  role  is  to  inform  the  public  in  an
       unbiased, reliable, and accurate manner; and


  (3) calls on all South Africans, not least opposition MPs, to resist  the
       opportunistic temptation of giving  credence  to  every  rumour  that
       tarnishes the legitimacy of our new democracy.

[Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the police have been warned  that  if  they  shoot  a  dangerous
           suspect in  the  back  they  will  face  charges  of  murder  or
           attempted murder, and will be liable for all legal costs;


       (b)  this warning came after the Supreme Court of Appeal  effectively
           changed the law by ruling that a policeman who shot  an  unarmed
           suspect had acted unlawfully; and


       (c)  this ruling came at a time when Dr Ike Ntsikelelo Nzo,  the  son
           of the late ANC leader, Alfred Nzo, is contemplating  emigrating
           or returning into exile because the criminals and crime in South
           Africa had dealt a huge blow to his patriotism;


  (2) endorses his remark that life in the new South Africa is as dangerous
       as it was under the apartheid regime;


  (3) accepts his belief that criminals will cost this  country  more  than
       apartheid did, and that the dream of an African Renaissance is  still
       a dream, because of what crime is doing to  the  economy  and,  as  a
       result, causing skilled people to flee the country; and


  (4) calls on the Government to -


       (a)  wake up from their sleep ...

[Time expired.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) instructs the Portfolio Committee on Safety and Security to meet with
       the Sebokeng psychiatrist, Dr Ike Ntsikelelo Nzo, to hear his reasons
       why he says that the violent crimes committed in South Africa  has  a
       worse effect on our nation than what apartheid had;


  (2) requests the ANC-led Government to meet with Dr Nzo to exchange views
       on why he believes that neighbouring Botswana has  the  solutions  to
       deal with criminals more effectively than ourselves;


  (3) congratulates Dr Nzo for the stand he took over the  weekend  against
       crime; and


  (4) requests the Government to take note of the hopes and dreams of  law-
       abiding citizens who want to live and raise children in a  crime-free
       South Africa.

Mr V G SMITH: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Arms  Procurement  Programme  is,  by  international  norms,
           groundbreaking  in  terms   of   transparency   and   democratic
           participation;


       (b)  one of the major aspects of the Arms  Procurement  Programme  is
           the  industrial  participation  component   which   is   a   key
           developmental  tool  that  will  lead  to  economic  growth  and
           employment creation;


       (c)  the Defence Industrial Participation component is proceeding  at
           a rapid rate with over 9,1% of the entire DIP credits  over  the
           entire life of the programmes already authorised with a value of
           over R1,3 billion; and


       (d)  one company has - within one year - achieved 27%  of  its  total
           DIP commitment; and


  (2) commends the  Government  for  ensuring  that  the  arms  procurement
       process achieves the strategic industrial development programme.

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) is concerned  about  the  impression  that  the  Government  and  all
       official agencies are continuing to mishandle the investigation  into
       the R43 billion arms deal;


  (2) does not support the decision by  the  Public  Protector  to  exclude
       television and radio;
  (3) believes that the withdrawal of Messrs Wally van Heerden and  Etienne
       Smit from the hearings when they are the  audit  officials  with  the
       best knowledge of the matter, once again diminishes public faith  and
       confidence in the process; and


  (4) expresses the hope that the hearings will not result in a  compromise
       of the investigation and of the public's  right  to  know  the  whole
       truth about the arms deal.

Prof L B G NDABANDABA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the IFP President, Dr M  G  Buthelezi,  MP,  on  having
       raised the profile of the third Black and African  Festival  of  Arts
       and Culture (Festac) 2002 which is at the  planning  stage  for  full
       culmination next year in December;
  (2) recognises that  this  significant  event  will  give  the  necessary
       impetus to the Millennium African Recovery Programme; and


  (3)  compliments  and  applauds  Dr  Buthelezi  for  having  harmoniously
       embraced the African and Western cultures  for  the  benefit  of  the
       masses of our people and the country as a whole.

Mr L ZITA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the planned marches by young people on 14 June 2001  to  demand
       jobs;


  (2) believes that the private  sector  can  play  an  important  role  in
       alleviating youth unemployment; and


  (3) calls on the private sector to -
       (a)  create jobs to address the plight of the unemployed youth;


       (b)  invest in skills development and training for young people; and


       (c)  invest in youth-owned enterprises and co-operatives.

[Applause.]

microphones!

Mnr J W LE ROUX: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)  historiese geboue die jongste teikens geword het  vir  diewe  en
           vandale en dat veral die Wes-Kaap geteister  word  deur  hierdie
           euwel;


       (b)  daar op groot skaal kentekens vanaf museums en historiese geboue
           gesteel word en as skrootyster verkoop word;


       (c)   die  toename   in   vandalisme   en   ook   graffitibesoedeling
           skrikwekkende afmetings aanneem en dat die beskadiging  van  ons
           historiese erfenis nie verder geduld mag word nie; en


       (d)  die skade reeds miljoene rande beloop; en


  (2) die Regering en die gemeenskap versoek om dringend aandag aan hierdie
       probleem te gee, en te verseker dat oortreders vervolg sal word.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J W LE ROUX: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  historical buildings have become the latest targets for  thieves
           and vandals and that the Western Cape  in  particular  is  being
           afflicted by this evil;


       (b)   there  is  large-scale  theft  of  emblems  from  museums   and
           historical buildings, which are being sold as scrap metal;


       (c)  increased vandalism as well as graffiti  pollution  is  assuming
           alarming  proportions  and  the  defacement  of  our  historical
           heritage can no longer be tolerated; and


       (d)  damages are already running into millions of rands; and


  (2) requests the Government and the community to give urgent attention to
       this problem and to ensure that the perpetrators are prosecuted.]

Ms A VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the growing number of people who  are  emigrating,  citing  the
       country's high crime rate as the reason;


  (2) further notes that this is a direct indictment of  the  ineptness  of
       the ruling ANC Government for not adequately dealing with  crime  and
       violence;


  (3) expresses its concern that the poor are being marginalised while  the
       rich and skilled are emigrating, creating  a  skills  vacuum  in  all
       sectors of our society;


  (4) urges the  Government  to  protect  the  poor  who  are  particularly
       vulnerable to crime as indicated by the  Institute  for  Justice  and
       Reconciliation; and


  (5) calls upon the Safety and Security cluster urgently and appropriately
       to devise an integrated plan to deal with combating  crime  in  South
       Africa.

Mr B M SOLO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that  figures  released  by  the  SA  Institute  for  Chartered
       Accountants show an increase of 21% for successful prospective  black
       candidates, and that 14% of these are female candidates;
  (2) also  notes  that  there  are  currently  only  400  black  chartered
       accountants out of 20 000 in South Africa;


  (3) further notes that if they all passed their next exam the  number  of
       black chartered accountants would double;


  (4) welcomes the positive steps and initiatives taken by the Institute to
       speed up the transformation of the profession; and


  (5) congratulates all the successful candidates and wishes them the  best
       of luck with the second part of their  exam  due  to  take  place  in
       November.

       struggle for liberation;

Agreed to.

                 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF 16 JUNE SOWETO UPRISING

                             (Draft Resolution)
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the  motion
printed in my name on the Order Paper as follows:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that Saturday, 16 June 2001, is the 25th anniversary of the June
           16 Soweto uprising;


       (b)  that this day is of historic significance  as  young  people  in
           Soweto and later throughout the country resisted  the  apartheid
           policies and Bantu education system;


       (c)  the defenceless and unarmed youths  who  selflessly  gave  their
           lives for the liberation of our people; and


       (d)  that the heroic struggles and sacrifices of the  youth  of  this
           generation played an important role in the  building  of  a  new
           nonracial, nonsexist and united South Africa;


  (2) resolves to commemorate the 25th anniversary of June 16; and


  (3) calls upon the youth to unite in action to fight racism, poverty  and
       the scourge of HIV/Aids  with  the  same  commitment  and  dedication
       demonstrated by the  generation  of  1976  in  the  struggle  against
       apartheid.

Mr S P MAKWETLA: Madam Speaker, hon members, four days from now our  country
will once again pause and ponder in commemoration of the  tragic  events  of
1976, whose lessons must for all time continue to define  our  future  as  a
nation. Many families will return to  cemeteries  to  clean  and  put  fresh
flowers on the graves of loved  ones  with  fond  memories,  signifying  the
price we had to pay for freedom. The  events  of  1976  added  a  new  word,
Soweto, to the vocabulary of world politics, meaning a  bloody  massacre  of
unarmed school children by an  oppressive  regime  that  was  obsessed  with
racist policies to the total outrage of the entire civilised world.

The student uprising of 1976 was born  out  of  autocratic  rule,  fanatical
racism and total disregard for human rights.  Through  the  introduction  of
Afrikaans  as  a  medium  of  instruction,  the  NP  government  sought   to
consolidate white conquest by, among  other  things,  denying  blacks  their
cultural identity.

Today we commemorate June 16 as an important day on  our  national  calendar
to underscore that the demands of the 1976 students,  who  rebelled  against
Bantu education  and  apartheid,  for  equality  and  respect  for  cultural
diversity, and against racism, discrimination and autocracy,  constitute  an
ideological precept which today gives  character  to  our  Constitution  and
content to our democracy.

Needless to say, this democracy can therefore, with all due respect, not  be
championed by parties in this  Parliament  that  are  remnants  of  the  old
establishment. Quite clearly, it is true that what  is  derisively  referred
to as the ``lost generation'' by intellectuals of the  old  order  paradigm,
is a generation of youth that indeed got lost to civility and the causes  of
apartheid. They are, however, the  heroic  trail  blazers  of  a  democratic
South Africa.

They accomplished, at an enormous cost to their  individual  wellbeing,  the
freedom that we enjoy today. I make these remarks because I believe that  it
is only through a conscious effort to put our history into perspective  that
we can limit the temptation by some of us as we prepare to  mark  this  day,
to approach June 16 as if it can mean anything and everything to  everybody.
This Parliament, as the premier political soul of our country, must lead  in
this regard.

Andile Ngotana wrote in the City Press of 3 June this year that  this  is  a
vexed question, even among today's youth leaders  themselves.  Xolela  Mancu
of the Biko Foundation argues that the challenge is to talk about  the  past
using the idiom of  today.  However,  Mancu  submits  that  the  celebratory
element of kwaito rallies creates an uneasy tension  with  the  sanctity  of
June 16.

Like all other nations, our future is intrinsically linked  with  our  past.
In order to appreciate our shape in future and the content of our  democracy
we cannot afford to neglect our history, lest we allow an ideological  drift
from the direction of  our  historic  march.  We,  too,  have  a  remarkable
history as a people. We must vigorously promote it  amongst  South  Africans
and narrate it to the world that comes  into  contact  with  us,  not  least
those visiting our shores.

We are a nation rising from the ashes of apartheid. We are a  country  whose
many patriots lie buried in  foreign  lands  across  the  globe  because  of
decades of systematic repression and persecution. We are a  people  with  an
undying spirit who believe that time is longer than rope. We are a  land  of
the missing and the dead without graves and yet with an intriguing  capacity
to forgive evil. This and many other themes of who  we  are  deserve  to  be
narrated by huge monuments, large and big as the stories they must tell  the
world. Only then will our visitors  know  that  we  are  more  than  just  a
country of sunny skies and fascinating wildlife on top  of  the  good  wines
and cuisine. Only  then  can  we  hope  to  reverse  the  alleged  political
alienation  and  apathy  of  our  youth.  Only  then  can  we  prevent   the
trivialisation of the sacrifices made by this heroic generation in a  manner
similar to what Sandile Memela wrote in City Press of June 3 this year.

The martyrs and heroes of 1976 surely deserve our appreciation. They do  not
ask for much. All they expect from us is a place in the glorious history  of
the struggle for democracy in this country and not derision by  some  of  us
who believe that the decisions they took were  not  for  the  good  of  this
country.

Mr S E OPPERMAN: Mevrou die Speaker, my tema vir  vanmiddag  is:  ``Gee  ons
jongmense hoop.'' [Madam Speaker, my theme for  this  afternoon  is:  ``Give
our youth hope.'']
Serious concerns were raised during and after last week's general  elections
in the UK about the lack of  interest  of  the  youth  in  politics  and  in
politicians. During our own elections last year, hundreds  of  thousands  of
our young people did not even bother to register and hundreds  of  thousands
of them did not turn up at the voting stations. This  is  an  ominous  sign,
because without the interest and involvement of the youth  in  politics  and
in our institutions, we have no future. This must be a  concern  to  all  of
us.

Dit is nie verkeerd as ons vandag  terugdink  aan  die  Soweto-opstande  van
1976 nie. Ons kan egter nie verwag dat dit dieselfde emosies  by  vandag  se
jongmense sal opwek as wat ons ervaar nie. Die meeste jongmense  van  vandag
voel oor die Soweto-opstande soos jong Afrikaners en Engelse oor die  Anglo-
Boereoorlog voel. Wat jongmense nodig het,  is  nuwe  inisiatiewe  wat  nuwe
passie by hulle kan loslaat, en dit lyk nie of die  Nasionale  Jeugkommissie
die perd is wat die wa deur die drif gaan kry nie, nie met 'n kans van  meer
as 300 000 teen 1 nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[It is not wrong if we think back today to the Soweto uprisings of 1976.  We
cannot, however,  expect  that  it  will  evoke  the  same  emotions  as  we
experienced in today's youth. Most young people of today feel the  same  way
about the Soweto uprisings as young  Afrikaners  and  English-speakers  feel
about the Anglo-Boer War. What the youth need is new initiatives  that  will
unleash a new passion in them, and it does  not  seem  as  if  the  National
Youth Commission will be able to get the job done, not  with  odds  of  more
than 300 000 to 1 against it.]

Three hundred thousand rand  per  year  was  the  amount  paid  to  the  ex-
chairperson of the National Youth  Commission  for  doing  what  a  reporter
called ``a pointless  job''.  She  was  the  highly  paid  chairperson  when
unauthorised  spending  of  over  R1,4  million  occurred.   She   was   the
chairperson when there were seven irregular notch promotions,  and  although
the promotions have been reversed, no deductions for  the  overpayment  have
been made.
She was also the chairperson of the  outgoing  executive  which  recommended
that the number of members of the commission be reduced from 19 to  5.  They
said it was necessary to improve the organisation's efficiency  and  impact.
What a revelation at the end of their term of office! By  implication,  they
said: ``We were inefficient all these years, and we made no impact.''

So, once again we are at a point of reflection, and we need to reflect,  but
reflection without a proper plan of action in which  we  give  direction  on
the way forward will be an exercise in futility.

And all of us need to grapple with this problem, because although we  belong
to different political parties with  different  policies  of  our  different
philosophies, we have a common destiny.

Ons gisters en ons eergisters - ons Soweto's - praat  met  ons;  met  elkeen
van ons, want geen normale mens is onaangeraak gelaat nie.  Op  die  een  of
ander wyse was elkeen van ons  deel  van  hierdie  traumatiese  gebeure,  en
elkeen met wie gepraat word, reageer. Sommige reageer met  onverskilligheid.
Hulle sê: ``Laat ons eet en drink en vrolik wees, want  môre  sterwe  ons.''
Sommige  reageer  met   swaaiende   arms,   flitsende   oë,   swetsend   met
skuimbekwoede; ander reageer met opgerolde moue, hande wat vereelt  word  en
sweet  wat  op  die  voorkop  pêrel.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Our yesterdays and days before yesterday - our Sowetos -  talk  to  us;  to
all of us, because no normal person has  been  left  unscathed.  In  one  or
other way we were all part of these traumatic events, and everyone that  one
talks to responds. Some react with indifference. They say: ``Let us eat  and
drink and be merry, because tomorrow we  die.''  Some  react  with  flailing
arms, flashing eyes  and  incoherent  rage;  others  react  with  rolled  up
sleeves, hands that become calloused and sweat that beads their foreheads.]

In whichever way we react, if our reaction does not give hope to  those  who
stare at us with emptiness in their eyes because of the emptiness  in  their
hands and the emptiness in their hearts, we are losing the battle.

Die diamantstormloop in  die  ongewing  van  Hopetown  het  begin  nadat  'n
diamant ontdek is waarmee 'n kind gespeel het. Die kind het nie  die  waarde
besef van wat sy in haar hande gehad  het  nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[The diamond rush in the vicinity of Hopetown  started  after  a  child  was
found playing with a diamond. The child did not realise the  value  of  what
she was holding in her hands.]

Our Parliament and our presence here is like a precious diamond. We can  use
our God-given opportunities positively or waste them in the sands of time.

Mevrou die Speaker, my insipirasie en my leiding kry ek uit die  Groot  Boek
wat onder andere die verhaal vertel van 'n sekere man wat afgegaan  het  van
Jerusalem na Jerigo en onder rowers verval het.  Hulle  het  hom  uitgetrek,
geslaan en vir dood laat lê. Die Leviet en die priester het die  man  gesien
maar  verbygegaan  sonder  om  enige  hulp  aan  te  bied,  maar  'n  sekere
Samaritaan het nader gegaan  en  sy  hulp  verleen.  Dit  was  nie  vir  die
Samaritaan belangrik om te weet wat die identiteit van die man was,  wat  sy
rassegroep was, wat sy politieke affiliasie was,  en  of  hy  deel  van  die
``struggle'' was  nie.  Al  wat  saak  gemaak  het,  was  dat  hierdie  arme
slagoffer in nood was!

Daar is miljoene slagoffers in ons land en die nood  waarin  hulle  verkeer,
is baie groot; slagoffers van misdaad, van  sinnelose  moorde  waarvoor  ons
keelvol is - en ons is ook keelvol vir hulle wat politieke speletjies  speel
met  die  gruweldade  waarmee  ons  gekonfronteer   word   -   verkragtings,
aanrandings, mishandelings, motorskakings;  slagoffers  van  epidemies  soos
tuberkulose en cholera en vigs; slagoffers van rassisme van alle  soorte  en
komende van alle kante - swart op swart, swart op wit, wit op  swart,  bruin
op geel, groen op wit - en slagoffers van werkloosheid  en  armoede,  en  ek
glo daar  is  sekerlik  mense  vandag  wat  deel  is  van  die  statistieke.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Madam Speaker, my inspiration and my guidance I get  from  the  Great  Book
that tells the story, inter alia, of a certain man who was  travelling  from
Jerusalem to Jericho when he was set upon by thieves. They stripped off  his
clothes, beat him and left him for dead. The Levite  and  the  priest,  when
they saw the man, passed him by  without  offering  any  assistance,  but  a
Samaritan approached the  man  and  assisted  him.  The  Samaritan  was  not
concerned about the man's identity, what racial group he belonged  to,  what
his political affiliation was, and whether he was part of the struggle.  All
that mattered was that this poor victim was in need of help!

There are millions of victims in our  country  and  the  distress  they  are
suffering is huge; victims of crime, senseless murders we are fed-up with  -
and we are also fed-up with those people that play political games with  the
atrocities that  we  are  confronted  with  -  rape,  assaults,  abuse,  car
hijackings; victims of epidemics such as tuberculosis and cholera and  Aids;
victims of racism of all kinds and coming from all sides - black  on  black,
black on white, white on black, brown  on  yellow,  green  on  white  -  and
victims of unemployment and poverty, and I believe there are  surely  people
today who are part of the statistics. [Interjections.]]

It is the responsibility of this Government, with the  co-operation  of  all
of us, to give our young people hope, not  with  empty  and  fine-  sounding
clichès, but with policies that will create the environment to  deliver  the
goods.

The Government must be pragmatic. If a policy  is  not  working  because  of
outdated philosophies, it must have the courage to look  at  other  options.
We cannot let down those who gave their all to improve the lives of all  the
people.

May I, in conclusion, put a challenge to the young people out there:


  Young people
  Reach higher
  Dig deeper
  Go further
  Grow stronger
  And build up the walls that lie ruined all around us!


  Don't look out for favours
  Don't shrink back from scorn
  Don't copy your traitors
  Don't revenge the wrong


  Just move on, go forward
  Your eyes on the goal
  make service priority
  and keep yourself whole


  Look forward to rewards
  At the end of the day
  When your maker will call you
  And proudly will say
  It was tough, but you have made it
  It was well done, my son.
[Applause.]

Mr B W DHLAMINI: Madam Speaker, hon members, 25 years ago South Africa  went
up in flames as the might of  the  apartheid  regime  cruelly  descended  on
young African students who, with their feet, were saying``Thus far,  and  no
further!'' to the imposition of Afrikaans as a medium of  instruction.  With
their bare hands, they faced up to the challenge.

All young people who now walk tall  as  citizens  of  a  free  country  must
forever pay tribute to the long line of heroes and heroines  who  sacrificed
their day for our freedom. As  the  youth  today  surf  over  the  waves  of
freedom and democracy, they must realise that their  predecessors  could  go
so far in the quest for total liberation of the African majority. They  need
to acknowledge that  the  struggle  is  by  no  means  over.  Shirking  from
carrying on with this struggle would be tantamount to betrayal.

The youth of 1976 faced the might of a heartless apartheid state to  correct
what was wrong in education as well as contribute  to  a  broader  struggle.
They did not intend to discourage young people from  seriously  taking  part
in education. Unfortunately, as the struggle  proceeded,  we  deviated  from
the spirit of the 1976 uprising. We then trumpeted: ``Liberation  first  and
education later!'' as our  war  cry.  No  wonder  the  education  system  of
Africans is going to the dogs.

Teachers have totally lost the will and dedication to wage the  struggle  to
its completion. They have  totally  forgotten  that  they  are  captains  in
charge of an army of liberation. They are now more worried  about  how  much
they can gain from the system. Likewise, the youth have completely lost  the
vision of the 1976 uprising. Today we see hooligans  masquerading  as  youth
running amok in schools, terrorising both teachers and  students.  Today  we
see rebellion against all forms of authority masquerading as expressions  of
freedom, defying teachers, parents and leaders with impunity.

Where are the Tsietsi Mashininis who will say: ``Enough is  enough''  It  is
shameful that the serious youth, instead of confronting  the  evil  that  is
taking over our schools, flee to the former white and Indian schools. Do  we
all run for shelter in the former white schools and leave education  in  the
townships to be swept into oblivion?

Another challenge that faces the African youth today  is  that  of  cultural
identity. Addressing this House on 31 May this year, the prime  minister  of
France, Mr Lionel Jospin, said:


  But there is a perceptible risk in many countries that a single  form  of
  culture, seen as entertainment, communicated in a single  language,  will
  come to dominate ... South Africa, however, can  see  how  quickly  young
  people embrace the standards of international  culture,  and  understands
  the long-term risk of dilution of its historical and  cultural  identity.
  Where Africa's cultural heritage once was pillaged, now it is  threatened
  by new forms of colonization ... Africa is the cradle of mankind.  It  is
  vital to preserve this heritage, enrich it  and  pass  it  on  to  future
  generations.

When one watches our youth walk the  streets,  one  would  be  forgiven  for
thinking that they are dark-skinned humans from Europe or the US.  When  one
watches our television and listens to  our  radio  stations,  one  would  be
forgiven for thinking that one is in a US or European island in Africa.

Our young people must know that they will never be able to wage  a  struggle
for youth development as long as they  hide  under  the  skirts  of  parties
whose background and character are not African. Parties  like  the  Disaster
Alliance will always retain a perspective that  is  foreign  to  an  African
idiom so long as they do not  transform  themselves  into  African  parties.
[Applause.] The  African  youth  must  rally  behind  and  strengthen  their
organisations which have always been African in character and  whose  ideals
are the true renaissance of the continent. If they think  and  believe  that
all is wrong in their organisations, they must  challenge  the  system  from
within and correct what is wrong.
Talking of nonracialism is sweet. But nonracialism must  not  be  a  pretext
for neglecting the  real  purpose  of  the  struggle,  which  is  the  total
liberation of the African majority. Nonracialism cannot be used  to  present
a picture of a ``rainbow''  nation  basking  in  the  sunshine  of  complete
freedom. We are far from attaining rainbow nation status. If there  is  ever
to be such a nation, there  still  is  a  job  that  must  be  done  in  the
struggle, and it can only be understood and done by Africans.

Africans have an advantage, because those who oppressed us enabled us to  be
close to them, albeit as workers and slaves. We  were,  therefore,  able  to
understand their languages and cultures. At least we know  a  thing  or  two
about them. White children and youth, on the other hand, were  sheltered  by
their parents from  any  contact  with  the  backward  savages.  Hence,  the
problem they grapple with today  as  adults  is  trying  to  understand  the
African mind.

I challenge the white youth to learn from this blunder. They  must  now  get
out of their cocoons and venture into the African world. They must take  the
initiative to understand  indigenous  languages  and  cultures.  They  must,
indeed, take the initiative to be part of the townships and  their  schools.
They must begin to want to learn what it is to be African. This is  the  one
foundation on which we can build racial understanding and  harmony  in  this
country.

The cries of ``Amandla!'', which thundered across the length and breadth  of
South Africa as the youth pushed forward with the struggle, should not  die.
They should still echo in the hills and valleys of our  country  until  true
liberation rolls down like water, and justice like a stormy stream. Let  the
youth of our country lead the  struggle  for  development.  Let  us  all  be
ambassadors of reconciliation and goodwill. [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, I want to know if the hon member  is  prepared
to take a question. [Interjections.]

The  DEPUTY  SPEAKER:  Order!  Unfortunately  he  has   left   the   podium.
[Applause.]

Mr P R MOKABA:  Madam  Speaker,  I  would  have  taken  it  on  his  behalf.
[Interjections.] Durand is heckling  here  and  asking:  ``Are  you  ANC  or
IFP?'' The ANC is the mother of all democratic politics. [Applause.]

Today we are observing a very important week and  year.  The  year  2001  is
among the most historic. It marks the launch of the African century.  It  is
the 25th anniversary of June 16, the Soweto uprising. It is  also  the  30th
anniversary of uMkhonto weSizwe. [Applause.] It  also  takes  place  in  the
context of the 45th anniversary of the adoption of the  Freedom  Charter  by
the ANC, after  it  was  adopted  at  the  congress  in  Kliptown  in  1955.
[Interjections.] This is important. Because we are dealing with  the  youth,
we are dealing with the future.

I must say that it is disappointing that the leaders of the DA are not  here
today to say exactly what they stand for with regard to the  youth  and  the
future of  this  country.  [Interjections.]  Instead,  their  representative
Opperman stands up here  to  attack  the  youth.  [Interjections.]  The  man
attacked the youth, instead of saying to them: ``Young people,  do  not  act
like a turncoat, as I did.'' He was ANC in the  1990s.  [Interjections.]  He
defected and now he attacks the Youth Commission, despite the sterling  work
that it is doing.

We are meeting here to remember those who died on,  before  and  after  June
16, because they fought. For what? They did  not  fight  against  education,
but for a democratic  system  of  education.  They  did  not  fight  against
Afrikaans,  but  against  the  imposition  of  Afrikaans  as  a  medium   of
instruction in  all  communities.  [Applause.]  That  is  what  is  critical
because, when one speaks  to  the  youth,  one  must  stick  to  the  truth.
[Interjections.]

I would say  to  Mr  Dhlamini  that  it  is  indeed  true  that  the  slogan
``Liberation first, education later!'' was a wrong slogan, but it was  never
a slogan of democratic politics. It was the slogan of the PAC -  the  master
of all irresponsible slogans. [Laughter.] So, let us tell the truth and  say
that the slogan of the  youth  of  democratic  politics  was  captured  most
succinctly by Cosas, namely ``Each one  teach  one!'',  having  learnt  that
from the workers' struggle led by Sadtu, ``An injury to one is an injury  to
all!'' [Applause.]

That we saw in the 1973 strikes, which prepared for June  16.  June  16  was
not an event, but was part of a process of liberation. It was built  by  the
Mandelas, the Sisulus, the O R Tambos, and  all  who  came  before  us,  who
launched the Youth League at an institution of education, Fort Hare.

The struggle, as led by the ANC, has  always  said  that  education  is  the
first act of liberation. So, let us not tell lies - that  is  what  we  were
taught,  namely  that  revolutionaries  tell  no  lies  and  claim  no  easy
victories - because it is on the basis of truth that  we  will  be  able  to
build a nonracial, democratic and prosperous South Africa; not on the  basis
of rewriting history. That is what the youth of South Africa  have  learned;
that is what they must be taught today.
As we speak to them today, it is  important  to  direct  them  to  the  real
things, namely that they can only gain  what  they  demand  if  they  remain
organised. Where must they be  organised?  It  is  in  the  organisation  of
democratic politics, that is, the ANC in the  first  place  and,  generally,
all organisations that stand for liberation. They have to ensure  that  they
safeguard the right that they have won, the right to elections,  and  ensure
that the historic mistake that  we  made  in  the  Western  Cape,  of  still
experimenting with whether or not the DA can  govern,  ends  with  the  next
election. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The first thing that they must do is to ensure that  they  help  to  rebuild
the families in the African communities which were destroyed  by  apartheid.
This  task  is  outstanding,  particularly  in  the  coloured  and   African
communities. It is important for them to know that they will be adults  some
day. They have to learn how to be  adults  by  respecting  and  safeguarding
their own families today. How? By fighting  against  crime  and  gangsterism
and ensuring that they remain in school and pursue knowledge.
That is why the first words of the SA Youth Congress, when it was  launched,
were that the youth must learn.  What  must  they  learn?  They  must  learn
historical and dialectical materialism, which is the science  of  knowledge.
[Interjections.]  What  is  knowledge?  They  said  that  knowledge  is  the
acquisition of the art and science of living and that it  is  important  for
the youth to pursue the truth at  all  times.  What  is  the  criterion  for
truth? Practice.

So, while they discuss Zimbabwe, HIV/Aids and every other issue that the  DP
thinks is something that  makes  for  politics,  the  youth  must  look  for
science and  abandon  superstition.  [Interjections.]  That  is  why  it  is
critical for them to stand up in defence of the ANC, here  and  abroad,  and
to stand up in defence of the President of this country,  here  and  abroad,
because it is not an attack against an individual, it is an  attack  against
the direction that we are taking as  a  country  and  against  what  we  are
saying we need: our independence,  an  independent  and  prosperous  African
continent and to be as equal as everyone  in  the  whole  world,  black  and
white. That is what the youth must be told.

They should ensure that  we  end  the  experiences  of  Babeile  and  Tshepo
Matloha who, today, are still suffering  from  the  ravages  of  the  racism
taught by white parents to their own children. It is  their  responsibility,
as our youth, to move out and hold each  other's  hands  and  point  to  the
future where they will have left the DA behind. [Interjections.]

Because this, my people, is a historic mistake. The continued  existence  of
the DA is a historic mistake, and it is the task of black  and  white  youth
to ensure that we agree on the fundamentals of what our society  should  be.
Let us compete on how to implement those fundamentals. We cannot do so  with
a grouping like this. [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, the DA is not a historical mistake; it  is
a reality of the future. [Interjections.] Yes, the ANC might be a very  good
political organisation, and ``liberation before education'' might have  been
a PAC slogan, but it was practised by the ANC. I  will  come  back  to  that
later in my speech. [Interjections.] And, of course, ``Kill the  boer,  kill
the farmer'' was not a PAC slogan.

Mev die Speaker, Paul Kruger het gesê: Neem uit  die  verlede  wat  mooi  en
goed is en bou daarop voort. Met apologie aan Kruger wil  ek  sê:  Neem  uit
die verlede dit wat lelik en sleg is en  vermy  dit  op  die  pad  vorentoe.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Madam Speaker, Paul Kruger said: Take from the past  that  which  was  fine
and good and build on it. With  apologies  to  Kruger  I  want  to  say  the
following: Take from the past that which was ugly and bad and  avoid  it  on
the way forward.]

Take that which is bad and reprehensible from the  past  and  use  it  as  a
warning not to repeat those mistakes. What bad and reprehensible events  led
to the Soweto uprising on  Wednesday,  16  June  1976?  The  report  of  the
commission of enquiry into the Soweto uprising  listed  the  enforcement  of
Afrikaans as a language of instruction as a major catalyst  leading  to  the
Soweto uprising, which spilled over to other parts of the country  as  well.
[Interjections.] One can hardly  believe  one's  eyes  when  one  reads  the
report.

Die gebrekkige kennis van, byvoorbeeld,  Afrikaans  aan  die  kant  van  die
leerlinge sal nie as verskoning aangebied  kan  word  nie.  Indien  daar  'n
onderwyser op die personeel is wat byvoorbeeld landbou deur die  medium  van
Afrikaans kan gee, dan moet dit gedoen word ongeag die  leerling  se  kennis
van daardie taal. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The poor knowledge of, for example, Afrikaans on the  part  of  the  pupils
cannot be offered as an excuse. If there was a  teacher  on  the  staff  who
could, for instance, teach agriculture  through  the  medium  of  Afrikaans,
then this had to be  done  regardless  of  the  pupil's  knowledge  of  that
language.]

The irony  is  that  this  kind  of  language  imperialism  was  imposed  by
Afrikaners whose own forefathers were themselves  the  victims  of  language
imperialism under Lord Milner at the end of the previous  century.  Had  one
learnt from the mistakes of others one would not have perpetuated  the  same
injustice during the 1970s.

However, unfortunately, language imperialism once again hovers in  the  air,
especially when one looks at the national plan for  higher  education  which
tends to transform all  universities  and  technikons  into  single-language
institutions. Language imperialism was a reprehensible  mistake  not  to  be
repeated in future and hopefully the ANC Government will not follow  in  the
footsteps of the Afrikaners of 1976.

The Soweto  uprising  was  part  and  parcel  of  the  liberation  struggle.
Political tyranny by the minority was a bad mistake not to  be  repeated  in
future. But once again the irony is that it  was  imposed  predominantly  by
Afrikaners  whose  forefathers  were  themselves  the  first  to   fight   a
liberation war on the continent  of  Africa.  Given  their  experience,  one
would have thought that they at least would not repeat the mistakes  of  the
colonial powers. Yet that is exactly what they did and, unfortunately,  most
of us endorsed it.

Unfortunately, political tyranny is also once again  hovering  in  the  air.
This time around, the tyranny by the majority is as bad as  the  tyranny  by
the minority. I am hopeful that the ANC Government will come to  its  senses
so that people belonging to cultural, religious and  linguistic  communities
will no longer feel  like  aliens  in  their  own  country.  Activating  the
Commission for the Promotion and  Protection  of  the  Rights  of  Cultural,
Religious and Linguistic Communities will be a good starting point.

The Soweto uprising was not an isolated incident. It was part of a  strategy
to make the country ungovernable and although the hon Mokaba denies  it  was
driven  by  the  slogan  ``liberation  before  education'',   this   had   a
devastating effect on education and resulted in a lost  generation,  as  was
the case in China during the cultural revolution. [Interjections.]

One just wonders whether the price paid by some pupils  was  not  too  high.
Hendrick Tshabalala describes his experience as follows  in  an  article  in
Rapport:


  The Soweto uprising had a tremendously negative impact on  my  education.
  If it was not for the 16th of June I  could  have  become  somebody  like
  Mandela.

I repeat, ``if it was not for the 16th of June I could have  become  someone
like Mandela''.

Mr H P CHAUKE: Who, you?

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Not me, I am quoting. Dan Mnkonyane said:


  I wanted to become a medical doctor. It  never  happened  because  things
  fell apart.

The use of learners as revolutionary agents, however praiseworthy the  cause
might have  been,  was  wrong  and  should  never  have  happened.  A  sound
education is the key to making South Africa a  successful  country.  Let  us
never again deprive  anybody  of  the  opportunity  to  educate  himself  or
herself to the best of his or her ability.

We once again want  to  reaffirm  our  sympathy  to  the  parents  who  lost
children in the Soweto uprising of 1976.

Mr D G MKONO: Madam Speaker and hon members, the anniversary of  the  Soweto
uprising brings with it harsh memories of repression but also reminds us  of
the triumph of the human spirit. More than anything else it  reminds  us  of
the might of the youth, their  ability  to  be  catalysts  for  change.  The
liberation that was looked upon as almost impossible twenty  years  ago  has
become a reality, and all of this in a relatively peaceful fashion too.

The generation of 1976 played  an  important  role.  They  became,  in  many
instances, the leaders of today and yet  the  work  is  not  done.  We  must
realise that the fruit of our labour  must  still  be  nurtured  for  it  to
ripple into lasting benefits for our children. It is  with  this  imperative
in mind that we must learn to look at our history not as something  divisive
but as a stark reminder of the pain and suffering that resulted from  racial
disunity and segregation.

Today more than ever our history must spur us towards greater unity and  the
forging of partnerships between all South Africans.  It  is  for  this  very
reason that the UDM was launched, with a  vision  of  creating  a  political
home for all South Africans united in the spirit of South Africanism by  our
common passion for our country, mobilising the creative spirit  inherent  in
our rich diversity.

The  need  to  build  partnerships  is  highlighted  by  a  survey  released
yesterday by the Institute for  Justice  and  Reconciliation.  The  findings
confirm that 56% of black people and 33% of whites think the other group  is
not trustworthy. These figures are a wake-up call for all political  parties
that the politics of race, which continue to be an  expedient  vote-grabbing
tool for many across the spectrum, threaten all that  we  have  achieved  in
the past seven years.

On this anniversary we must remember not only the youth of  yesteryear,  but
also the youth of today and tomorrow. They must inherit from  us  more  than
just painful memories of young people bleeding on  the  streets  of  Soweto,
but also realities of  socioeconomic  freedom,  resulting  from  multiracial
harmony and partnership. Without an inheritance that emphasises  our  common
humanity and our shared future, our youth may very well end up in 25  years'
time bleeding on the streets of Soweto for  a  better  future,  which  their
fathers and mothers were unable to give them.

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, on belhalf of the ACDP I would like  to  move
an amendment to this motion deleting the words in paragraph  3:  ``to  fight
racism, poverty and the scourge of HIV/Aids'', and replacing them  with  the
words: ``to build nonracialism, prosperity for  all,  and  an  HIV/Aids-free
society''.

I move this amendment because  of  a  genuine  concern  about  the  negative
culture the youth  has  inherited,  that  is,  fighting  things  instead  of
building them. I say this with authority, having been an active  participant
in the 1976 riots here in Cape Town. Since the advent  of  democracy  a  lot
has changed. I appeal for a change in strategy. We know how  to  fight;  let
us now teach the youth how to build.

Masifundise ulutsha ukuba eli lilizwe lethu, yaye lo nguRhulumente  wabantu,
wesininzi. Masakhane siyeke ukulwa. Ulutsha  maluncedise  ekwakheni  isizwe.
(Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Let us teach our youth that  this  is  our  country  and  that  this  is  a
democratically elected government, the majority  government.  Let  us  build
each other and stop fighting. The youth must assist in the building  of  the
nation.]

As adults let us teach our youth, such as those in Cosas, to  stop  fighting
and to begin to build. Let us turn our  youth  around  from  negativism  and
hopelessness, to a positive and optimistic attitude. I propose that  policy-
makers in Government, political parties, business  and  society  in  general
must have youth development as an integral part of all their strategies  and
policy-making. It is the adults' responsibility to train the youth.  Let  us
train the youth in the way they should go, and when they are old  they  will
not depart from it.

It is our duty to inculcate good moral values into our youth. We must  teach
them the values of sacrifice for their  country,  respect  for  parents  and
elders, respect for one another. Let us teach  them  to  have  tenacity  and
resilience in the face of crime, and not to head for  greener  pastures.  If
all the youth run away, who is going to build this nation? Let us teach  our
youth to plough back what they have received. Let us teach them  to  respect
the Government, the administration, its officials  for  examples  ministers,
mayors, preachers, premiers and so on. The adult must lead by  example  and,
for example, steer clear of foul language. The media in all its  forms  must
take responsibility because they inculcate  values,  good  or  bad,  in  our
youth.

Mayiphele le nto,  umzekelo,  yokuba  kubizwe  uMongameli  ngegama,  kuthiwe
nguThabo.  Yintoni  esiyifundisa  ulutsha  xa  sibiza  uMongameli   ngegama?
Sifundisa abantwana  ukudelela  uRhulumente  ngolo  hlobo.  (Translation  of
Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Let this habit of calling the  President  by  his  first  name  stop.  What
message are we sending to the youth when we call our President by his  first
name? We are teaching children to disrespect the Government in that way.]

Let us help our youth to come out of the culture of fighting, let  us  teach
them by example to become builders and, above all, let us  teach  our  youth
the fear of God. [Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mevrou die Speaker, die bates en die rykdom van 'n  land
lê nie in sy minerale of nywerhede nie, maar in sy mense. Die mense  van  'n
land bepaal hoe sterk 'n land se ekonomie is, hoe vreedsaam 'n  land  is  en
wat die norme en waardes van 'n land is. Die mense van  'n  land  bepaal  of
daar  wedersydse  respek  vir  mekaar,  vir  verskillende   volke   en   vir
verskillende lande is. Die toekoms van 'n land en  sy  mense  word  dan  ook
bepaal deur sy jeug.

Die konsepbesluit maak melding van  die  opoffering  van  die  jeug  in  die
uitbouing van 'n  nuwe,  nie-rassige,  nie-seksistiese  en  verenigde  Suid-
Afrika. Die vraag is egter, het ons 'n verenigde  Suid-Afrika?  Het  ons  'n
stabiele Suid-Afrika? Het ons 'n Suid-Afrika waarin daar  wedersydse  respek
is vir mekaar?

Die werklikheid is dat die nuwe generasie van die jeug  dit  anders  ervaar.
Die nuwe swart jeug volg die voorbeeld van  hulle  voorgangers,  naamlik  om
paaie te versper, om motors aan die brand te steek en skade aan te rig  soos
vanoggend gebeur het by  Britstown  en  vroeër  vanjaar  in  Warrenton.  Die
kultuur van geweld wat deur die ANC geskep is, word vandag  deur  die  swart
jeug voortgesit, nádat hulle bevryding ervaar het,  en  die  vraag  is,  vir
watter doel?

Die blanke jeug van Suid-Afrika vertrek vandag na Londen,  nie  omdat  hulle
noodwendig daar wil wees nie,  maar  omdat  regstellende  optrede  in  Suid-
Afrika hulle  dwing  om  daarheen  te  gaan,  wat  niks  anders  is  nie  as
rassediskriminasie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is die nuwe blanke jeug,  wat  nie
deel was van apartheid nie, maar wat die prys moet betaal vir apartheid.

Die 1976-onluste het onder meer gegaan oor die taalkwessie in  swart  skole.
As na die onluste van 1976 verwys word, word daar ook altyd  verwys  na  die
krag en die emosie wat  taal  by  groepe  teweeg  bring.  Hiervan  moet  die
Regering baie duidelik kennis neem. Tans word tale in  Suid-Afrika  verdring
en ongelyk behandel, veral deur  die  huidige  Regering,  tot  voordeel  van
Engels.

Die VF is ten gunste van die gelykberegtiging van al ons amptelike  tale  en
nie net Afrikaans nie. Die werklikheid is dat daar 'n bepaalde aanslag  teen
Afrikaans as sodanig is, veral in die staatsdiens en die  werkplek.  Ek  wil
dit egter baie duidelik vandag hier sê: ek is trots daarop om  Afrikaans  te
kan praat, want dit is my moedertaal, en dit behoort vir almal 'n  saak  van
trots te wees om in hulle moedertaal te kan praat. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Ek wil dit vandag  duidelik  stel,  as  ons  die  taalregte  van  groepe  en
individue misken, sal ons 'n nuwe vlaag van  onluste  in  Suid-Afrika  begin
ervaar.  Die  nuwe  blanke  jeug  sal  dan  ook  sê:   ``Aluta   continua!''
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, the assets and the wealth  of  a  country
do not lie in its minerals or industries, but in its people. The  people  of
a country determine how strong its economy is, how peaceful it is  and  what
its norms and values are. The people of a country  determine  whether  there
is mutual respect for one another, for different peoples and  for  different
countries. The future of a country and its people is also determined by  its
youth.

The draft resolution makes reference to the sacrifice of the  youth  in  the
development  of  a  new,  nonracial,  nonsexist  and  united  South  Africa.
However, the question is, do we have a united South Africa?  Do  we  have  a
stable South Africa? Do we have a South Africa  in  which  there  is  mutual
respect for one another?

The reality is that the new generation of our youth  are  experiencing  this
quite differently. The new black youth are following the  example  of  their
predecessors, namely blocking roads, burning motor cars and causing  damage,
as happened this morning in Britstown and earlier this  year  in  Warrenton.
The culture of violence that was created  by  the  ANC  is  being  continued
today by the black youth, after they have  experienced  their  freedom,  and
the question is, to what purpose?

The  white  youth  of  South  Africa  are  today  leaving  for  London,  not
necessarily because they want to be there, but  because  affirmative  action
in South Africa is forcing them to go  there,  which  is  nothing  short  of
racial discrimination. [Interjections.] It is the new white youth, who  were
not part of apartheid, who must pay the price for apartheid.

The 1976 riots were, inter alia, about the language issue in black  schools.
Whenever reference is made to the 1976 riots, reference is also always  made
to the power and the emotion that  language  brings  about  in  groups.  The
Government must take careful cognisance of this.  Currently,  languages  are
being marginalised and treated unequally in South Africa, especially by  the
current Government, to the benefit of English.

The FF is in favour of the equality of all our official languages,  and  not
only Afrikaans. The reality is that there is a  specific  onslaught  against
Afrikaans as such, especially in  the  Public  Service  and  the  workplace.
However, I want to state very clearly today: I am proud to be able to  speak
Afrikaans, because it is my mother tongue, and it  should  be  a  matter  of
pride  for  everyone  to   be   able   to   speak   their   mother   tongue.
[Interjections.]

I want to state clearly today that if we fail  to  appreciate  the  language
rights of groups and individuals, we will begin to experience a new wave  of
riots in South Africa. The new white  youth  will  then  also  say:  ``Aluta
continua!'' [Interjections.]

Mnr P A GERBER: Mevrou die Speaker, dit is vir my bevrydend  en  'n  voorreg
om in Afrikaans aan hierdie debat deel te neem, in hierdie bevryde  inheemse
taal wat sy verdrukkerskubbe afgeskud het  en  gesond  geword  het,  hierdie
taal wat die vonk in die kruitvat was. (Translation of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Mr P A GERBER: Madam Speaker, it is liberating and a privilege  for  me  to
participate in this  debate  in  Afrikaans,  in  this  liberated  indigenous
language which has shaken off the scales of the oppressor and  become  well,
this language which was the spark in the tinder-box.]

In no other democracy in  the  world  will  one  experience  such  patience,
forgiveness and freedom.

Ek wil graag hierdie toespraak opdra  aan  die  drie  Visser-weeskindertjies
van my kiesafdeling,  Ceres.  Die  jaar  1976  hou  vir  mense  verskillende
betekenisse in. Dit was ook die eerste jaar waarin daar 'n  oudleerling  van
ons skool op die grens as dienspligtige doodgeskiet is. Ja, Douga Kotze,  'n
Boland-rugbyspeler op pad na Springbokkleure, se dood  het  die  oorlog  vir
ons aan die Weskus huis toe gebring. Soos  hulle  sê,  ``Older  men  declare
war, but it is the youth who must fight and die.''

Dit was die eerste keer dat ons skool aan die Weskus 'n oomblik  van  stilte
gehandhaaf het vir 'n gestorwe oudleerling. Dit was ook die jaar  waarin  my
predikantpa die eerste keer 'n gestorwe soldaat moes begrawe.  Dit  was  ook
die jaar waarin my moeder een van die enigste twee  onderwyseresse  was  wat
tydens die onluste toegelaat is om in die bruin skool in  Louwville  aan  te
hou skoolhou.

Baie van ons het nooit as jong kinders geweet van die drie vakke  in  Engels
en drie  vakke  in  Afrikaans  van  die  kinders  van  Soweto  nie.  Op  die
enkelkanaalnuus  is  ons  gebombardeer  deur  propaganda   teen   sogenaamde
kommuniste en terroriste. Net soos Zola Budd eers in  Brittanje  gehoor  het
van Nelson Mandela, is die jong wit jeug gekastreer deur disinformasie.  Vir
wie moet die wit jeug van daardie  tyd  hierdie  rekening  stuur  van  hulle
verwronge en vermorste jare? Die boodskapper sit afgetree iewers  langs  die
see.

Nooit ooit moet die jeug van Suid-Afrika weer  toelaat  dat  politici  hulle
drome kontamineer of besoedel met ideologieë nie. Jongmense moet  die  dinge
in hulle omgewing  wat  nog  nie  reg  is  nie  onverbiddelik  aanvat.  Geen
misdaad, geen geweld en geen rassisme is die eerste gebod van ons nuwe Suid-
Afrika.

Ek sit Sondagoggend in my kerk, die NG Kerk in Wellington, wat  halfvol  wit
lidmate sit. Twee straatblokke verder begin die sogenaamde bruin gebied.  Ek
kan nie glo dat dit in die jaar 2001 nog steeds so is nie. Die  wit  kinders
gaan ná die diens na die wit NG Kerk se sondagskool.  Hoe  is  dit  moontlik
dat ons steeds ons kinders onderwerp aan kerkapartheid?

Is dit nie die eerste plek waar ons  moes  saam  gebid  het  voor  ons  saam
gepolitiek het nie? Kerkapartheid moet stop. Dit was Christus wat gesê  het:
``Bring die kindertjies na  my  toe.''  Maandagoggend  gaan  daardie  selfde
kindertjies na die plaaslike model C-skool. Daar sit hulle  saam  met  hulle
bruin en swart maats op dieselfde skoolbanke, maar hulle mag  nie  toegelaat
word om saam op dieselfde kerkbanke te sit nie.

As ons kyk na die personeel by ons model-C skole, is baie van die  skole  se
personeel nog leliewit, dit terwyl die kinders lankal geïntegreerd  is.  Ons
is weer eens besig om nog steeds apartheid in die personeelkamer te  bedryf.
Ons kan nie so aangaan nie. Dit is hierdie dinge  wat  die  jeug  van  Suid-
Afrika sal moet regstel. 'n Nasie wat nie na sy jeug kyk  nie,  is  soos  'n
astrante, dom man wat nie pensioen uitneem vir sy aftrede nie.
Die afgelope week is  my  kiesafdeling,  Ceres-Witzenberg,  geruk  deur  die
barbaarse dubbele moord van 'n Ceres-egpaar. Daardie egpaar se dood het  ons
gelaat met drie weeskindertjies: Klein Jan, Bennie en Danie Visser. Toe  die
skoolhoof die drie seuntjies ingeroep het om  hulle  mee  te  deel  van  hul
ouers wat vermoor is, was die eerste reaksie van  die  een  seuntjie:  ``Wie
gaan na die diere kyk?'' Hy het nie gesê: ``Gaan jag die mense  wat  my  pa-
hulle  geskiet  het  nie.''  Hulle  het  moedig  vorentoe   gekyk.   Daardie
moordenaars is verseker van 'n bed, drie etes, warm water en 'n dak oor  hul
koppe vir die res van hul lewens in die tronk. As hulle wil,  kan  hul  dalk
ook nog deur Unisa studeer.

Ceres se nuutste drie weeskindertjies is egter nie verseker van 'n  dak  oor
hulle koppe, 'n warm bed of drie etes per dag nie, en tog sê hulle  dat  ons
die moordenaars moet vergewe, want ``anders gaan hulle nie in die hemel  kom
nie, en dan kan jy self nie in die hemel kom nie''.

Aldus Bennie Visser. Uit die mond van die suigeling hoor jy die waarheid.
Hierdie drie jong mannetjies leer vir baie  van  ons  jongmense  in  hierdie
land  'n  les,  jongmense  wat  so  maklik  verval  in   die   spiraal   van
negatiwitiet, apatie  en  mismoedigheid.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Baie  keer  vra
jongmense of hulle ouers genoeg gedoen het om apartheid te keer.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mevrou die Speaker, is die agb lid bereid  om  'n  vraag
te beantwoord?

Mnr P A GERBER: Hy mors my tyd. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to dedicate this speech to the three orphaned Visser  children
of my constituency, Ceres. The year 1976 means different things  to  people.
It was also the first year in which a former pupil of our  school  was  shot
dead on the border while doing military service. Yes,  the  death  of  Douga
Kotze, a Boland rugby player on his way to Springbok  colours,  brought  the
war home to us on the West Coast. As they say, ``Older men declare war,  but
it is the youth who must fight and die.''

That was the first time our school on the West Coast maintained a moment  of
silence for a deceased former pupil. That was also  the  year  in  which  my
father, who was a minister, had to bury a deceased  soldier  for  the  first
time. It was also the year in which my mother was one of only  two  teachers
who were allowed to continue teaching in the coloured  school  in  Louwville
during the unrest.

As young children many of us never knew about the three subjects in  English
and three subjects in Afrikaans of the children of Soweto.  On  the  single-
channel news we were bombarded with propaganda against so-called  communists
and terrorists. Just as  Zola  Budd  only  heard  about  Nelson  Mandela  in
Britain, the young white youth were castrated  by  disinformation.  To  whom
should the white youth of that period send their account  for  their  warped
and wasted years? The messenger has retired somewhere along the coast.

The youth of South Africa must never again allow politicians to  contaminate
or pollute their dreams with  ideologies.  Young  people  must  relentlessly
tackle the things in their environment which are not yet  right.  No  crime,
no violence and no racism is the first commandment of our new South Africa.

On Sunday morning I sit in my church, the NG Church in Wellington, which  is
half full of white members. Two street blocks away  the  so-called  coloured
area begins. I cannot believe that this is still the case in the year  2001.
After the service the white children go to  the  white  NG  Church's  Sunday
school. How is it possible that we still  subject  our  children  to  church
apartheid?

Is that not the first place where we should have prayed together  before  we
became engaged in politics together? Church  apartheid  must  stop.  It  was
Christ who said: ``Bring the little children unto me.''  On  Monday  morning
those same children go to the local Model C  school.  There  they  sit  with
their coloured and black friends on the same school benches,  but  they  are
not allowed to sit in the same church pews with them.

If we look at the staff at our Model  C  schools,  many  of  these  schools'
staff complement is still lily-white, and that while the children have  been
integrated for some time now. Once again we are still engaging in  apartheid
in the staff room. We cannot go on like this. It is things like  this  which
the youth of South Africa will have to rectify.  A  nation  which  does  not
look after its youth is like an impudent, stupid man who does not  take  out
a pension for his retirement.

During the past week my constituency, Ceres-Witzenberg, was  shaken  by  the
barbaric double murder of a Ceres couple. That couple's death  has  left  us
with three orphans: little Jan, Bennie and Danie Visser. When the  principal
called the three boys in to tell them  about  their  parents  who  had  been
murdered, the one little boy's first reaction was: ``Who is  going  to  look
after the animals?'' He did not say: ``Go and hunt the people who killed  my
parents.'' They looked ahead courageously. Those murderers are assured of  a
bed, three meals, hot water and a roof over their heads for  their  rest  of
their lives in prison. If they wish, they could also possibly study  through
Unisa.

However, Ceres's newest three orphans are not assured of a roof  over  their
heads, a warm bed or three meals a day, and yet  they  say  that  we  should
forgive the murderers, because ``otherwise they will not go to  heaven,  and
then we cannot go to heaven either. This according to Bennie Visser. Out  of
the mouths of babes one hears the truth.

These three young boys are  teaching  many  of  our  young  people  in  this
country a lesson, young people  who  so  easily  fall  into  the  spiral  of
negativity, apathy and despair.  [Interjections.]  Often  young  people  ask
whether their parents did enough to prevent apartheid.

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, is the hon member  prepared  to  answer  a
question?

Mr P A GERBER: He is wasting my time. [Interjections.]]

He is wasting my time.

Wat ons moet vra, is of  ons  ouers  genoeg  doen  ná  apartheid,  nie  voor
apartheid nie. Maak hulle 'n verskil, of saai hulle  verdere  gif  teen  die
nuwe Suid-Afrika? Ons as ouers het die toekoms geleen by  ons  kinders.  Ons
het dit nie geërf by ons voorgeslagte  nie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[What  we  should  ask  is  whether  our  parents  are  doing  enough  after
apartheid, not before apartheid. Are they making a difference, or  are  they
sowing further poison against the new South Africa?  We  as  parents  borrow
the future from our children. We did not  inherit  it  from  our  ancestors.
[Interjections.]]

I  wanted  to  analyse  your  brain,  but  I  have   not   found   it   yet.
[Interjections.]

Aan die jongmense van Suid-Afrika wil ek sê dat terwyl  daar  jongmense  is,
sal daar 'n ANC vir hulle wees, en terwyl daar mense is  wat  ly  as  gevolg
van honger, armoede en rassisme, sal daar 'n ANC vir hulle wees.

Ons is in vir moeilike weer. Ons sal ons sitplekgordels  moet  vasmaak.  Ons
sal ons ouers moet dagvaar tot nasiebou.  Ons  sal  moet  bou  aan  'n  nuwe
nasionalisme. Die jeug moet help dat ons 'n land skep waarin helde wil  bly.
Ons demokrasie moet sterk word sodat dit die  instinkte  van  ons  jeug  kan
vertrou. Daar is 'n nuwe geslag van robuuste,  patriotiese  jongmense  besig
om op te staan: jongmense wat nie jappiegriep het nie, maar ammunisie is  in
die arsenale van ons jong demokrasie, jongmense wat die  hele  Afrika  hulle
speelveld maak, jongmense wat  Afrika  veilig  maak  vir  demokrasie  en  'n
markekonomie.

Die enigste ding wat hulle vrees,  is  vrees  self.  Dit  is  jongmense  wat
verskil met dit wat Bernard Shaw gesê het, naamlik:  ``Youth  is  wasted  on
young people.'' Dit is jongmense wat  nie  innerlik  emigreer  nie,  dit  is
jongmense wat oorsee gaan met retoerkaartjies, wat nie weghardloop  van  die
probleme in Suid-Afrika nie. Dit is jongmense wat glo dit is geseënd  om  te
lewe, maar dit is hemels om jonk te wees. Dis is  belowende  jongmense,  nie
jongmense met beloftes nie.

Ek wil graag afsluit met 'n gedig wat die oorlede  digter  H  A  Fagan  voor
1939 geskryf het:


  ``Nkosi sikelel' i-Afrika''
  Uit duisend monde word die lied gedra.
  Ek sluit my oe; soos 'n serafskoor
  val daar stemme strelend op my oor:
  ``Nkosi sikelel' i-Afrika'' -
  ons vra U seen, o Heer, vir Afrika.
  Ek kyk, en sien die skare voor my staan:
  Zoeloe en Kosa, Soeto en Sjangaan,
  en ek, 'n Blanke - vele volkre, ja, -
  almal verenigd om Gods seen te vra
  op net een tuiste, net een vaderland,
  want die Alwyse het ons saam geplant
  en saam laat wortel in Suid-Afrika.
  ``Nkosi sikelel' i-Afrika'' -
  seën, Heer, die land wat vele volkre dra.

[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I want to say to the young people of South Africa that  as  long  as  there
are young people, there will be an ANC for them, and as long  as  there  are
people who suffer as a consequence of  hunger,  poverty  and  racism,  there
will be an ANC for them.

We are in for heavy weather. We will have to fasten our seatbelts.  We  will
have to summons our parents to nation-building. We will have to build a  new
nationalism. The youth will have to  help  us  create  a  country  in  which
heroes want to live. Our democracy must become strong so that it  can  trust
the instincts of our youth. A new  generation  of  robust,  patriotic  young
people is rising up: young people who  do  not  have  yuppie  flu,  but  are
ammunition in the arsenal of our young democracy, young people who make  the
entire Africa their playing field, young people who  make  Africa  safe  for
democracy and a market economy.

The only thing they  fear  is  fear  itself.  These  are  young  people  who
disagree with what Bernard Shaw said, namely: ``Youth  is  wasted  on  young
people.'' These are young people who do not emigrate internally,  these  are
young people who go overseas with return tickets, who do not run  away  from
the problems in South Africa. These are young people who believe that it  is
a blessing to be alive, but it is heavenly to be young. These are  promising
young people, not young people with promises.

I would like to conclude with a poem written by the  late  poet  H  A  Fagan
before 1939:


  ``Nkosi sikelel'i-Afrika''
  Uit duisend monde word die lied gedra.
  Ek sluit my oë; soos 'n serafskoor
  val daar stemme strelend op my oor:
  ``Nkosi sikelel'i-Afrika'' -
  ons vra U seën, o Heer, vir Afrika.
  Ek kyk, en sien die skare voor my staan:
  Zoeloe en Kosa, Soeto en Sjangaan,
  en ek, 'n Blanke - vele volkre, ja, -
  almal verenigd om Gods seën te vra
  op net een tuiste, net een vaderland,
  want die Alwyse het ons saam geplant
  en saam laat wortel in Suid-Afrika.
  ``Nkosi sikelel' i-Afrika'' -
  seën, Heer, die land wat vele volkre dra.

[Applause.]]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, the class of 1976,  among  the  youth,  took
courage to  fight  against  enforced  Afrikaans  in  their  education.  They
mounted their resolve with passion, discipline and diligence.

In commemorating the silver anniversary of that fateful day, which  resulted
in over 1 000 young people dying, some being  maimed  for  life  and  others
fleeing the country, we  should  do  so  in  a  dignified,  disciplined  and
passionate manner.

Our youth should look ahead and not try to replay the  events  of  1976.  We
should imbue  them  with  the  spirit  of  hard  work  and  discipline.  The
liberation attained should be guarded by people who will  work  until  sweat
turns to blood.

Quality education, which the youth strove for,  should  be  the  target  for
all, young and old. Our youth should seek knowledge that  knows  no  colour,
which will put South African youth on a par with the best in the world.

The fight against racism, poverty and HIV/Aids will remain wishful  thinking
if our young people are not properly educated and disciplined. A  nonsexist,
nonracial and united South Africa means nothing if people continue  to  feel
entitled to the wealth of the country without doing anything.

With discipline, the youth will be tolerant, diligent and resist  premarital
and unprotected sex, thereby avoiding  HIV/Aids.  Discipline  goes  hand  in
hand with self-control. No one should go about like a loose cannon.

The 41-year-old Poppie Buthelezi of Soweto, who is  wheelchair-bound,  is  a
victim of the shooting on 16 June 1976. She laments the  kwaito  singers  as
attractions for commemorating the day. This,  according  to  her,  does  not
dignify the day at all. June  16  functions  should  be  commemorative,  not
celebrative. We should be solemn and dignified, so that posterity can  learn
more about the fallen heroes who  contributed  hugely  in  accelerating  the
liberation process of this country.

We call on the youth to unite while we pray that  much  of  their  strength,
which they forged into this world  with  great  determination,  should  make
this country a pleasant one to live in. We plead with  them  to  resist  the
temptation to commit crime.

We pay tribute to the dauntless young men and women, some  of  whom  are  in
this House, who stood up at the time. We  appreciate  the  good  fight  they
fought. We admire the full distance that they have run and, surely, one  day
they will wear the crown of victory.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, this is a historic day, as we commemorate  the
25th anniversary of 16 June 1976 and the Soweto  uprisings.  We  honour  the
young heroes who sacrificed, early in the  prime  of  their  lives,  for  no
earthly reason except that they had reached the point  where  they  had  run
out of patience and had to declare: Enough, enough.

The Soweto crisis was about education.  Dr  Andries  Treurnicht,  acting  on
behalf of his party and government, issued a  circular  demanding  that,  as
the English and Afrikaners were paying for black education,  the  medium  of
instruction  in  schools  should  be  on  a  50/50  basis,  in  English  and
Afrikaans. I wonder  how  many  English  and  Afrikaans  pupils  would  have
tolerated being taught on a 50/50 basis through  the  medium  of  Venda  and
IsiXhosa. This was naked bullying, white domination with its head off.

Having taught in schools at the time, I know  that  there  was  a  cold  war
between the government of the day and the English  language.  The  contested
sphere of influence and domination was the African  masses.  Leron  Bennett,
in The Negro Mood, wrote:


  The question of education for black people is  a  question  of  life  and
  death. It is a political question, a question  of  power.  The  power  to
  name, to define and control minds. He who controls minds  has  little  or
  nothing to fear.

Verwoerd, Treurnicht and their type were in blissful ignorance of  the  fact
that leaders like Biko, Sobukwe and Mothopeng had long been waging a  battle
of mental liberation. Listen to what Mothopeng had said earlier:


  The aim of the ideas of the ruling class is to enslave the African  child
  perpetually and make him feel inferior, so that he might become  an  easy
  victim of easy exploitation.

Listen to what Biko had said later:


  Not only have the whites been bullying, been guilty of  being  offensive,
  but, by  some  skilful  manoeuvre,  they  have  managed  to  control  the
  responses of the blacks to the provocation. Not only have they kicked the
  black but they also show him how he should react to the kick.

And also listen to what Pityana had to say in 1971:


  We have been oppressed a great deal. We have been exploited a great deal.
  It is our weakness that has led to our people being oppressed,  exploited
  and disregarded. Now we want a revolution, a revolution which  brings  to
  an end our weakness, so that we are never again exploited,  oppressed  or
  humiliated. The grand plan of white domination was turned on its head.

What have we learned from Soweto 1976? I want to suggest that in  particular
the Afrikaans language nearly disappeared from  the  face  of  South  Africa
because of the blunder of 1976. That should not be repeated  again,  because
Afrikaans is a beautiful language spoken by all  people,  including  blacks.
It also teaches us something  about  national  unity.  It  also  teaches  us
something about education, that it should be raised to  a  level  where  the
youth of this country can actually have better  education  and  be  able  to
improve themselves. The question of unemployment,  particularly  of  school-
leavers, is a prime factor as well as the question of Aids.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! The hon member's time has expired. Before I  call
on the next speaker, I would like to recognise my  predecessor,  the  former
Deputy Speaker, Dr  Ranchod.  Welcome  back.  [Applause.]  I  also  wish  to
recognise a delegation from the Botswana parliament,  led  by  their  Deputy
Speaker. Welcome. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, today, this year, this week  reminds  us  of
the sadness of losing our beloved children. The MF notes  with  sadness  the
25th anniversary of the Soweto uprising. The so-called  Soweto  uprising  is
the result of one of the inhumanities, evils and cruelties displayed by  the
previous apartheid regime, when numerous students were killed in the  battle
between students  and  the  police.  This  occurred  because  students  from
several schools in Soweto protested  against  the  use  of  Afrikaans  as  a
medium of instruction in the school. One of the students said:
  We strongly refuse to swallow an education that is designed  to  make  us
  slaves in the country of our birth.

Now, 25 years later, the MF wishes to salute those young  unsung  heroes  of
yesteryear who formed the stumbling block of a long fight against  apartheid
and achieved the freedom and democracy that we have today.

Now we acknowledge 16 June as South African Youth Day  in  honour  of  those
young people. As former President Nelson Mandela said on 16 June 1994:


  The youth were inspired by a thirst for knowledge: Knowledge  that  knows
  no colour; knowledge acquired through persuasion and hard work; knowledge
  that taps and releases creative energies; and  knowledge  that  puts  the
  South African youth on a par with the rest of the world.

The MF compliments Government for the development of a youth  policy,  which
has the inclusion of principles to ensure the involvement of  the  youth  in
the democratisation of South African society.  It  is  also  commendable  to
note the adoption of the South African Schools Act, Act  84  of  1996,  that
provides that Government must fund public schools on an equitable  basis  to
redress past inequities in education provision.

The MF  also  compliments  Government  for  its  budget  allocation  to  the
National Youth Commission and supports 16 June being declared South  African
Youth Day. The MF calls on all young people to  move  forward  and  build  a
better and peaceful South Africa. I just want  to  leave  a  little  bit  of
knowledge with the youth of today: Help ever, hurt never. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, in a debate  like  today's,  one  has  a  choice
between the politically correct approach and the honest approach.  I  prefer
the latter. A prominent part of South  African  society  does  not  identify
with Youth Day on 16 June. Allow me to motivate this.

Die jeug, sonder al die ingewikkelde agendas van ons grootmense, behoort  'n
samebindende faktor te wees tussen die verskillende  gemeenskappe  in  Suid-
Afrika. 'n Dag soos Jeugdag behoort dit te simboliseer, maar 16 Junie  slaag
egter nie daarin nie. Ek gun Suid-Afrikaners wat  in  die  struggle  gestaan
het van harte hul reg om hierdie dag te gedenk. Dit is beslis vir  hulle  'n
hoogtepunt op die kalender. Die vraag is egter of met reg en billikheid  van
alle gemeenskappe in Suid-Afrika verwag kan word om ewe  opgewonde  te  raak
oor hierdie dag. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The youth, minus all the intricate agendas of we  adults,  ought  to  be  a
factor that unites the various communities in South Africa. A  day  such  as
Youth Day ought to symbolise this, but 16 June does not succeed in  that.  I
wholeheartedly grant those South Africans who were part of the struggle  the
right to commemorate this day. To them this definitely  is  a  highlight  on
their calendar. However, the question is whether one can, in  all  fairness,
expect all South Africa's communities  to  be  equally  excited  about  this
day.]

The date 16 June tells a story, after all. It tells a story, if one  listens
even to the debate today, of the good guys and the  bad  guys,  the  cowboys
and the crooks, the heroes and the culprits.  The  people  I  represent  are
identified and blemished as the crooks and the culprits of 16 June 1976.  In
all sincerely and honesty, it would be  pure  hypocrisy  if  I  began  toyi-
toying on this day.

Laat my toe om vir die Huis 'n voorbeeld  te  gee.  Afrikaners  was  in  die
vorige eeu in 'n bitter stryd teen die Engelse gewikkel, naamlik  die  stryd
om bevryding van kolonialisme.  Deur  die  jare  heen  het  daar  versoening
plaasgevind, maar tog het ons nooit van die  Engelse  gemeenskap  verwag  om
die oorwinning van Majuba  saam  met  ons  op  27  Februarie  te  vier  nie.
Sprekers in hierdie debat het geredeneer dat ons nou in 'n nuwe  Suid-Afrika
is, dat almal vry is as gevolg van 16 Junie 1976 en daarom  moet  almal  dit
saam vier.

Dit sou dalk kon gebeur het as die resultaat werklik vryheid  was  vir  alle
gemeenskappe in die land. Ervaar ons nie maar net vandag 'n ander  vorm  van
taalimperialisme  nie,  met  Engels  as  die   oorheerser   nie?   Of   dalk
kultuurimperalisme, met die eie karakter en etos van skole en  universiteite
onder  skoot  nie?  Word  ons  nie  dalk  gevra  om  die   oorwinning   teen
minderheidsoorheersing te vier,  terwyl  ons  dit  bloot  ingeruil  het  vir
meerderheidsoorheersing nie?

Die datum 16 Junie 1976 vertel vir ons van kinders wat opgehou het  om  kind
te wees. Dit vertel van die jeug in opstand en rebellie. Is dit  nie  lynreg
die teenoorgestelde van wat die Skrif ons leer van seuns  wat  in  hul  jeug
opgekweek moet word soos plante, en van dogters wat  uitgebeitel  moet  word
soos hoekpilare van 'n paleis nie?  Kan  ons  met  reg  die  opstandiges  in
Warrenton verdoem? Kan ons Cosas se dreigemente om privaatskole  te  ontwrig
verdoem terwyl ons die opstand van die  jeug  in  1976  verheerlik?  Is  dit
konsekwent? Ek wil vandag maar net eerlik met almal wees: Die  AEB  kan  nie
rasend  opgewonde  raak  oor  16  Junie  nie.  (Translation   of   Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Allow me to give  the  House  an  example.  In  the  previous  century  the
Afrikaners were locked in a bitter struggle against the English,  which  was
the  struggle  for  liberation   from   colonialism.   Through   the   years
reconciliation took place, but we never expected the  English  community  to
join us in celebrating the victory at Majuba on  27  February.  Speakers  in
this debate have argued that  we  are  now  in  a  new  South  Africa,  that
everyone has been liberated owing to 16 June 1976 and that  everyone  should
therefore celebrate this together.

This might have happened if the  result  had  truly  been  freedom  for  all
communities in the country. But are we today not just  experiencing  another
form of linguistic imperialism, with  English  as  the  victor?  Or  perhaps
cultural imperialism, in which the unique character  and  ethos  of  schools
and universities are coming under fire? Are we not perhaps  being  asked  to
celebrate the victory over minority rule, while we have merely traded it  in
for majority rule?

The date 16 June 1976 tells us about children who  stopped  being  children.
It tells us about the youth in  uprising  and  rebellion.  Is  this  not  in
diametrical opposition to what  the  Scriptures  teach  us  about  boys  who
should be raised like plants in their youth, and about girls who  should  be
chiselled out like corner pillars to a palace? Can  we  justly  condemn  the
rebellious ones at Warrenton?  Can  we  condemn  the  threats  by  Cosas  to
disrupt private schools while we glorify the 1976 rebellion  of  the  youth?
Is that consistent? I just want to be honest with everyone  today:  The  AEB
cannot get frantically excited about 16 June.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam  Speaker,  the  youth  of  1976  who
participated in those glorious events we are remembering in this House,  are
now men and women in their 40s and 50s.  There  is  a  sense  in  which  the
characterisation of the day as one for the youth puts these  men  and  women
in the margins. We put at the centre of our  remembrance  young  people  who
were either  not  born  or  were  too  young  to  remember.  And,  unfairly,
sometimes some of us try to compare the youth  of  today  to  the  group  of
1976. Apart from the  fact  that  the  young  people  of  today  live  in  a
different environment with its influences and imperatives,  our  society  is
not helping them to develop a  greater  sense  of  relevance  in  their  own
country.

It is this society that bombards our young with  avalanche  after  avalanche
of American music, films and other cultural expressions  that  have  nothing
except violence, decadence and conspicuous consumerism. When they switch  on
the TV or radio or open a magazine or newspaper, these are the  images  that
hit them. At street corners and taxi ranks pornographic magazines  are  sold
very freely. One will reap what one sows. We cannot feed  our  young  people
decadence and then expect them to be revolutionaries in  the  mould  of  the
1976 generation.

It is this society that is not giving our young people a  sense  of  history
by de-emphasising history learning in  our  schools.  Through  no  fault  of
their own, many of them are not quite sure where we come from as  a  country
and as a people. Contemporary young people are from the same proud stock  as
Steve Biko, Hector Peterson, Mangaliso Sobukwe,  Chris  Hani  and  countless
others. They are not just weaklings who can do nothing except  have  a  good
time. They are smart enough to confront the  problems  of  HIV/Aids,  crime,
poverty and ignorance. What they need is support from society  in  the  form
of depiction and propagation of our values on TV, on  radio,  in  newspapers
and magazines, as well as a well-run education system  that  situates  their
generation in history.

They need our society to fill  their  heads  with  knowledge,  positive  and
relevant images of themselves, their country and their role in it.  In  this
way, we will be developing their mental and spiritual strength and the  grit
necessary to confront the real national issues of today. [Applause.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker, hon members,  this  year  we  mark  the  25th
anniversary of the June 16 Soweto uprising. It is a time for reflection  and
forward planning. Unfortunately, the ANC has used it as an  opportunity  for
cheap political point-scoring. [Interjections.]

Initially, living within  the  protected  environment  of  my  community  in
KwaZulu-Natal, the whole incident seemed quite far removed. But when  I  got
to campus the next day and listened  to  our  SRC  urging  us  to  join  the
protest and show our support for the unnecessary loss  of  life  and  police
brutality, reality and anger began to set in, as did a sense  of  pride  and
admiration for those students who initiated the action.

Such a day indeed needs to be honoured. It is part of  our  history,  albeit
at the price of human tragedy. Those who sacrificed, did so for all  of  us,
irrespective of race or political affiliation. However,  as  we  commemorate
the occasion, let us not only voice  mere  words  of  appreciation  for  the
truly noble purpose these youths served. Let us acknowledge  the  worth  and
value of the role that the youth, both then and now, can and have played  in
fighting the scourge of apartheid and oppression. While  paying  tribute  to
those who sacrificed their lives in the struggle, let us  also  pay  tribute
to those who are alive.

As one of my esteemed colleagues has said, do something for  the  living  in
order to honour the dead heroes. The question we should ask is: what can  we
collectively as a nation do for our youth? We  can  empower  the  youth  and
unite to fight the scourge of HIV/Aids. This disease has  the  potential  to
wipe out a whole generation. It is reported that one in three  teenagers  in
South Africa is HIV-positive. At one stage, South Africa had  the  advantage
of witnessing this emerging epidemic north of its borders and responding  to
it proactively before the full impact hit home. Unfortunately,  this  window
of opportunity slammed shut and many who were  at  high  risk  have  already
been infected.

Nevertheless,  considerable  opportunities  still  exist  to   prevent   new
infections among adolescents. The  youth  of  today  present  us  with  many
opportunities for targeted interventions which can shape the future  of  the
epidemic. There are a number  of  reasons  why  focused  interventions  make
sense, with the most important being  that  the  youth  are  more  open  and
amenable to the concept of learning sexual behaviour and using  safe  sexual
practices to stay HIV-negative. Keeping as many youth as  possible  negative
means more uninfected young adults to fill the skills gap  and  to  take  on
the burden of parenting  and  other  household  leadership  roles  that  the
pandemic presents. Promotion initiatives can  contribute  to  creating  hope
for the future.

In conclusion, let us not forget that it was the  youth  25  years  ago  who
laid the foundation of freedom for all, most especially  the  oppressed.  To
mark the occasion of June 16 this year, instead of playing games with  human
lives and  politicising  HIV/Aids,  let  us  unite  to  fight  the  pandemic
together so that we can  give  real  meaning  to  the  ideal  of  peace  and
reconciliation. If we do not, we may not have the  occasion  25  years  from
today  to  celebrate  the  achievements  of  the  youth  of  South   Africa.
[Applause.]

Mr K M N  GIGABA:  Chairperson,  each  historical  period  defines  specific
challenges of national progress and leadership. I personally belong  to  the
generation of  leaders  for  whom  the  achievement  of  democracy  was  the
defining challenge. Thus did Comrade Nelson Mandela summarise  the  specific
mission, challenge  and  achievement  of  his  generation.  Freedom  in  our
lifetime was their battle cry, the single goal for which they were  prepared
to die. As long as the achievement of this mission  was  still  outstanding,
so long would all the new generations of youth after them have to renew  the
struggle in its pursuit, in line with the historical epoch they occupied.

Of course, Frantz Fanon had already said that each generation must  discover
its mission which it must fulfil or betray. Accordingly, as each  generation
discovers this mission, it must  draw  up  its  own  tasks,  fight  its  own
battles, wear its own mantle and earn its own accolades. This  it  does  not
do for generations either preceding or succeeding  it  and  neither  can  it
claim the victories and accolades of these generations.  It  must  make  its
own mark with which future generations will identify it.

In the  tapestry  of  our  struggle,  the  youth  of  1976  will  stand  out
illustriously, as having thunderously pronounced their mission, pursuing  it
with relentless zeal until the achievement  of  the  defining  challenge  of
freedom in our lifetime. Our society owes  these  young  lions  a  permanent
debt for their struggles and sacrifices. It has an obligation to explain  to
the youth of today what made the youth of 1976 commit such heroic  feats  of
struggle as they did. A political lull had engulfed our people for  decades,
leading the apartheid regime to believe that it had broken the back  of  the
ANC, quelled the revolutionary fires and oppressed the masses in a  cowardly
fashion.

A death-defying youth, unarmed in the face of  deadly  apartheid  machinery,
suddenly, in  a  flash,  put  paid  to  the  regime's  mirage.  For  decades
thereafter the urban and rural fields of our country would  become  theatres
of struggle, consumed in a conflagration of struggle between  the  apartheid
supremacists and the masses fighting for freedom and nonracialism.

Of history they say that those who ignore and disparage  it,  are  bound  to
repeat  its  ills  and  mistakes.  We  revolutionaries  know   that   heroic
historical events, even if they result in  momentary  defeat,  constitute  a
great well from which we frequently draw our pride, honour  and  inspiration
to fight on ever towards final victory. During this,  the  25th  anniversary
of that fateful but heroic day,  we  salute  Hector  Peterson,  Steve  Biko,
Tsietsi Mashinini and all the  generations  of  youth  after  1976  for  the
sacrifices they made for our freedom  and  the  supreme  nobility  of  their
efforts. Because of these modest efforts, and those of  all  our  people,  a
new historical period dawned, defining new specific challenges  of  national
progress and leadership.

In saluting the youth  of  1976,  we  are  reminded  of  the  difficult  and
humbling challenge we face to define  our  own  mission,  draw  in  our  own
tasks, wear our own mantle and wage our own battles. No other generation  of
youth shall ever again be present in South  Africa  during  this  moment  of
transition from the tragedy of racial oppression to the glorious future.

Basically, we are called upon to carve and blaze our own new path.  Thus  do
we proclaim it to be the mission of our generation to  create  and  live  in
the  new  nonracial,  nonsexist,  democratic  and  prosperous  society.  Our
forebears could only defeat apartheid and  lay  the  foundation  for  a  new
society. But we, free from the rot and rabble of the past, possess the  real
possibility to propel our society to a new level, and  thus  accomplish  the
task of national liberation and social emancipation.

All these things we have said above have relevance for our understanding  as
youth of what we must do today, if we are not to  betray  our  mission.  For
this to happen, we need the self-initiative  and  leadership  of  the  youth
themselves, and the critical but enthusiastic support of  the  nation  as  a
whole. We need to raise the level of consciousness  of  the  youth  so  that
they act vigorously as a potent force  for  change.  They  must  consciously
wage a sustained and relentless fight against racism, sexism and poverty.

Attending our schools today, is a generation of South  Africans  growing  up
and studying in free conditions. This generation presents  us  with  a  real
possibility to bridge the racial and gender divides  and  nurture  it  along
nonracial and nonsexist lines. But  instead  of  taking  advantage  of  this
really golden opportunity, we  seem  content  enough  to  allow  inertia  to
retard our progress in this direction as  if  we  expect  that  these  young
people, whose parents still carry the entire baggage of the past, and  still
feed them this venom, as is the case in Vryburg, will automatically, and  by
themselves without the right  nonracial  and  nonsexist  nurturing,  develop
this nonracial and nonsexist consciousness and behaviour.  In  this  regard,
nonracial and nonsexist education must be made  mandatory  in  all  schools;
and every public school must  offer  a  least  one  African  language  as  a
mandatory course. [Applause.]

Schools themselves must be encouraged to embark  upon  academic  social  and
cultural integration, while advantaged and  disadvantaged  schools  must  be
encouraged to unite and co-operate and embark upon academic, social,  sports
and cultural exchange programmes, including the  exchange  of  learners  and
teachers in order to allow for contact between learners and  foster  greater
understanding, tolerance and co-operation among them. Of this  Bram  Fischer
said in court in 1966:


  Only contact between these races can eliminate suspicion and  fear;  only
  contact  and  co-operation  can  breed   tolerance   and   understanding.
  Segregation or apartheid, however genuinely believed in, can produce only
  those  things  it  is  supposed  to  avoid  -  interracial  tension   and
  estrangement, intolerance and racial hatreds.

Indeed, President Mbeki stated two weeks ago in ANC Today  that  we  should,
as South Africans, acknowledge that to succeed in building  the  nation,  we
must  walk  on  the  two  legs  of  national   reconciliation   and   social
transformation.

Bold measures must be taken by the youth today, free of the baggage  of  the
past, to advance beyond their parents  in  the  effort  to  build  a  single
united, nonracial and nonsexist nation. Young men in society have a duty  to
advocate and support every effort to empower, develop  and  integrate  young
women in all the political and socioeconomic spheres  of  society.  We  must
make it our responsibility to fight against sexism  and  gender  inequality.
To create a prosperous society requires that bold measures must be taken  to
economically empower the youth  with  jobs,  entrepreneurship  opportunities
and skills through learnership and internship programmes.

While Government has introduced  good  measures  in  this  regard,  such  as
through the Umsombuvu Fund, it must be submitted that,  given  the  enormous
challenge that we face, more work must still be done. Further measures  must
be introduced to ensure that young people benefit  from  the  programmes  of
black economic empowerment.

Parastatals must play a big role  with  regard  to  skills  development  and
providing  resources  for  the  Integrated   Human   Resources   Development
Strategy. A  special  call  must  be  made  to  the  private  sector,  which
possesses the largest volumes of  productive  capital,  to  make  more  real
dedication to the challenge to address  the  plight  of  the  youth  through
economic empowerment and skills development.

The economic plight of the youth of our country has forced  them  to  embark
upon many desperate activities to survive. But that will  not  be  for  long
because they shall, henceforth, militantly fight for what is their  right  -
development. When they march to the Sacob offices on Thursday, all over  the
country, they will be doing so because the owners of capital are  not  doing
enough, despite all their profits and the productive capital  they  command,
to ensure that all benefit in real terms.

Together  with  these  challenges  to  address  poverty,  we  will  need  to
intensify our learning - to learn hard, to learn intensively  and  to  learn
permanently. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Motion agreed to.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 22 - Justice and Constitutional Development:

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Mr  Chairperson,
hon members, ladies and gentlemen ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order, hon Minister! There  are
a lot of people walking around. Order! Hon members,  this  is  an  important
debate. Will all those who are in the isles, please take your seats.  Order!
Are you ready now? Hon Minister, you may continue.

The MINISTER: thirty-seven years ago today, Nelson  Mandela,  Walter  Sisulu
and others were sentenced to life imprisonment for daring the might  of  the
apartheid state. It is thanks to them, and  indeed  to  the  sacrifices  and
struggles of many others, that we are able to stand here this afternoon  and
make the remarks that I am about to make about our justice system.

When I reported to  this  honourable  House  last  year,  I  identified  the
challenges my department had to meet for the 21st century. Today, four  days
from the end of my second year in office,  I  am  happy  to  report  on  the
progress made in meeting these challenges and the goals the  department  has
set itself for the new financial year.

I would like to thank, at  the  very  outset,  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Justice and Constitutional Development and, in particular, its  chairperson,
Adv  Johnny  de  Lange,  for  the  usual  work  of  sterling   quality   and
interventions which influenced legislation for the benefit of our country.

Allow me to turn immediately to the issues raised in my last report to  this
House. It is well known that our Government seeks to develop and  strengthen
our public-private partnerships  in  strategic  areas.  In  this  regard,  I
reported last year on our engagement of senior business  executives  in  the
review and finalisation  of  our  strategic  plans  and  changed  management
process within the department. One such business leader, Paul Heinemann,  is
in the audience here this afternoon.

I am extremely delighted to report excellent progress in this area. We  have
identified our strategic objectives and vision,  and  agreed  to  a  radical
restructuring of our department. A board of directors similar to that  of  a
private company now advises the department.  Serving  as  directors  on  the
board are both executive and non-executive  members,  drawn  from  both  the
private and public sectors of our economy.
The chief executive officer, who is also the  accounting  officer,  and  the
managing directors of seven business units serve  as  executive  members  of
the board. These self-contained business units have clear  responsibilities,
and are made accountable to the board for  their  performance.  Among  these
business units are four line-function  structures  dealing  with  all  court
services, legal services, legislation  and  constitutional  development  and
the Masters Office.

The four supporting business units which are designed  to  formulate  policy
at national level, are the office of  the  chief  financial  officer,  human
resources, public education and communication, and information  and  systems
management. In the restructuring process my department has given  prominence
to the masters division by elevating it to one of its core functions. It  is
imperative that the operations of the unit in the provinces be  restructured
in order to pave the way for the  absorption  of  intestate  black  estates.
This needs immediate attention. I am extremely confident  that  the  process
we have embarked upon will yield significant service delivery benefits  and,
hopefully, serve as a model for the rest of our Government.

Before  I  step  off  this  particular  topic,  I  wish  to  report  on  the
developments relating to the judiciary. The Ministry  together  with  senior
officials of the department met on 2 April this year in Cape Town  with  the
President of the Constitutional Court, the Acting Chief  Justice  and  other
senior members of the judiciary to discuss policy  issues  relating  to  the
structure and functioning of the courts. The commitment of the judiciary  to
transformation was indeed reaffirmed.

The meeting agreed  on  the  following  broad  principles  relating  to  the
judiciary:  The  head  of  the  judiciary  should  be  the   head   of   the
Constitutional Court who will be  the  Chief  Justice  and  will  chair  the
Judicial Service Commission and perform other constitutional  and  statutory
functions presently divided between  the  President  of  the  Constitutional
Court  and  the  Chief  Justice  of  the  Supreme  Court  of   Appeal.   The
Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal  will  not  be  merged.
The Labour Appeal Court will continue to be the final  court  of  appeal  in
all  labour  matters.  All  impediments  to  the  complete  independence  of
magistrates should be removed.

The meeting appointed a task team consisting of members  of  the  judiciary,
officials  of  the  department  and  the   National   Director   of   Public
Prosecutions, to prepare a document  on  the  Constitution  and  other  laws
which may  require  amendments  in  order  to  give  effect  to  the  policy
perspective agreed upon. The task  team  will  also  attend  to  outstanding
matters which require further discussion and consultation. A Bill  to  amend
the relevant sections of the Constitution is already before Cabinet.

We are committed to continuing our focus on  court  infrastructure  and  the
upgrading of our courts will remain a major challenge. Significant  progress
is substantiated by 56 new courtrooms  at  19  court  buildings  which  were
completed during  1999,  and  a  further  88  new  courtrooms  at  28  court
buildings which were constructed during 2000. Most of  these  projects  have
been undertaken in previously disadvantaged rural areas of our  country  and
will, undoubtedly, contribute to the goal of bringing justice closer to  the
people. The projects include five community safety  centres  founded  on  an
integrated and one-stop service basis. In order to equip new  buildings  and
to upgrade facilities of existing offices, an amount of  R27,5  million  was
utilised for the services, furniture and office machines.

The following areas, in provinces with the highest overall levels of  crime,
have been identified  and  will  be  piloted:  Alexandra  and  Katlehong  in
Gauteng;  Inanda  and  KwaMashu  in  KwaZulu-Natal;  Mitchells   Plain   and
Khayelitsha in the  Western  Cape;  and  Mdantsane  and  Motherwell  in  the
Eastern Cape. We also have recently refurbished and  constructed  seven  new
courtrooms in the west wing of the High Court in  Cape  Town.  This  project
was launched last Wednesday.

The  department's  record,  with  regard  to  financial  administration  and
management, has been less than satisfactory to say the least.  We  have  now
put together measures that  we  believe  will  ensure  compliance  with  the
Public  Finance  Management  Act.  We  now  have  proper  budget  management
structures  in  place  covering,  among  others,  strategic  management   of
budgeting;  allocation  of  the  budget  down  to  the   lowest   level   of
expenditure;  budget  allocation,  and  the  establishment  of  the   review
committee; and joint budgetary planning with our cluster partners.

Beyond this, our internal audit component, which is  directly  monitored  by
the Audit Committee, has been operating effectively.  Furthermore,  a  fraud
prevention strategy  and  a  code  of  ethics  have  been  finalised  and  a
permanent fraud prevention committee was appointed. We have also  set  up  a
24-hour antifraud and anticorruption hotline. In  addition,  I  have  called
for, and we are in the process of establishing  a  costing  and  rightsizing
unit to establish the  cost  from  the  zero-base  to  the  delivery  of  an
equitable justice system for all.
Security in our courts has, in  the  past  few  years,  deteriorated.  Worse
still, judicial officers, prosecutors and court staff have had  their  lives
threatened. In view of the threats made to  the  officials  in  the  Western
Cape, special measures have been put in  place  in  collaboration  with  the
SAPS and intelligence agencies. As regards the general security measures  in
our courts, we have allocated additional resources to increase our  security
cover this year by 100%. We will, therefore, be catering for at least  about
40% of our offices countrywide. We intend to intensify our  efforts  in  the
coming years.

We have introduced and  implemented  the  national  lower  court  management
system project which has, as its aim, the separation  of  functions  between
the judiciary, administration and prosecution, in all magistrates'  offices.
Certain administrative functions previously performed  by  magistrates  will
be carried out by administrative officials to  allow  court  officials  more
time to concentrate on their judicial functions.

Great progress has been made in the  training  of  administrative  officials
over the past year. An office manager's pilot  project  was  implemented  at
the Johannesburg and Durban magistrates' courts. We now intend extending  it
to four other pilot sites. We  envisage  the  scenario  of  having  properly
trained professional managers for  all  our  courts.  We,  however,  require
funds in order to create and fill the posts  which  will  certainly  enhance
court  efficiency  at  all  levels,  and  assist  us  in  consolidating  the
independence of the judiciary.

Improving efficiency and skills at court  level  has  been  given  priority.
Since June 1997, six training programmes, sometimes referred to  as  ``fast-
track training'' were presented to aspirant prosecutors by Justice College.

With the assistance of the  Law,  Race  and  Gender  Research  Unit  of  the
University of  Cape  Town,  Justice  College  succeeded  in  developing  and
presenting various  social  context  training  programmes  for  departmental
officials and magistrates. Justice College also started  presenting  two  to
three-day workshops dealing specifically with issues  of  domestic  violence
and maintenance.

During the past year we have trained 310  criminal  court  magistrates,  226
civil court magistrates, 534 prosecutors, 58  aspirant  prosecutors  and  77
interpreters. A total of 76 magistrates received specialised social  context
training, 190 received training on maintenance  legislation,  and  42  child
welfare officers  received  training.  A  total  of  104  officials  of  the
department received training on the principles  of  administrative  justice,
223 magistrates, 183 prosecutors and 226 clerks of the  department  received
training on domestic violence.

However, it is a fact that 37,3% of our courts are not functioning well.  It
is no surprise that these courts, the remnants of  the  apartheid  era,  are
situated in the rural areas of the former bantustan areas,  particularly  in
the Northern Province, the North West  province,  KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga
and  Eastern  Cape.  The  following  interventions  are  being  implemented:
Justice College has employed 15 tutors to engage on  the  job  training  for
approximately 800 magistrates and  600  prosecutors  who  had  never  before
received any formal training. The upgrading  of  court  structures  and  the
reprioritisation of capital works, for  example  in  Tembisa,  Daveyton  and
Malamulele, is also taking place. Integrated justice  system  court  centres
to deal with bottlenecks have already been implemented.

The past year saw my department working  intensively  to  implement  our  e-
Justice programme. This programme is designed to  modernise  our  management
systems and bring these  in  line  with  international  best  practice.  The
programme, in its current phase, involves the provision of basic  electronic
infrastructure and  connectivity;  the  development  of  a  court  and  case
management system; and  the  development  of  our  financial  administration
systems.

The Court Process Project, which deals with the development of our case  and
court management system, is our flagship. The system, which is  a  proof  of
concept, has been developed and a demonstration thereof  was  launched  last
week here in Parliament. We anticipate that the system will be installed  as
from 1 October this year.

The Awaiting Trial Prisoner Project was  launched  as  a  pilot  project  to
address the excessively high number of prisoners  awaiting  trial,  who  are
housed by the Department of Correctional  Services.  The  objective  of  the
project is to  initiate  collective  actions  within  the  criminal  justice
cluster of departments, to reduce the  detention  cycle  time  of  awaiting-
trial prisoners in custody. It is envisaged to introduce this initiative  at
20 more sites throughout the country during the current financial year.  The
focus will be on those courts that are  experiencing  greater  than  average
case backlogs.

The experience in Middelburg has shown that over the  period  December  2000
to April 2001 the following  successes  were  achieved:  The  average  court
hours per day increased from three hours and 45 minutes to five  hours.  The
number of cases finalised increased from 101 in December to  216  in  April.
The number of cases withdrawn due to dockets not being  at  court  decreased
from 20 to nil, this thanks to the dedication of our personnel who  are,  as
is well known now, working even on Saturdays to ensure that we reduce  these
backlogs.

We have indeed also embarked upon setting up commercial  courts.  The  first
one was established in Pretoria and indeed has 13  specialised  prosecutors.
Since January last year 565 cases were registered, 123 of  which  have  been
investigated, 124 have been enrolled, 26 have resulted  in  convictions  and
20 sentences have been reported to date.

The process  between  the  South  African  Police  Service  and  Justice  is
currently being  simplified  to  achieve  more  effective  results.  Special
commercial courts are also planned for Durban, Cape Town  and  Johannesburg.
I am happy to announce that from  1  July  this  year  a  second  specialist
commercial court is to be established in Pretoria.

Government has introduced a number of  measures  over  the  past  few  years
aimed at updating the arsenal of weapons  available  to  fight  specifically
organised  crime,  such  as  the  Proceeds  of  Crime  Act  of   1996,   the
International Co-operation in Criminal Matters Act of 1996, the  Extradition
Act and the Prevention  of  Organised  Crime  Act,  which  incorporated  the
Proceeds of Crime Act.

These laws introduced sophisticated new measures that have  been  used  with
some success  internationally  in  the  creation  of  money  laundering  and
racketeering offences and the introduction  of  asset  forfeiture.  We  have
indeed also embarked upon improving  the  quality  of  prosecutions  through
general training to develop the skills of prosecutors, among other things.

As I have said, we are  dealing  with  the  case  backlogs  and  indeed  the
prosecutors, the courts, the Correctional Services people, the  magistrates,
and even the judges are working  on  Saturdays  to  reduce  these  backlogs.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  I  have  been
trying to catch the attention of quite a number of hon members.  This  is  a
very important task of Parliament in respect of accountability.  You  should
be holding the Minister accountable and listening to what he has to  report.
However, some of you have been continuing with  conversations  unabated  for
about 20 or 25 minutes, and I think that is unacceptable. May I now call  on
you please to pay attention to what is being accounted for in Parliament.

The MINISTER: As a cluster we are also embarking upon a project  to  address
the question of the demand for the reduction of drugs. While we have  indeed
been successful, generally, in dealing with the problem of  the  importation
of illicit drugs and narcotics into our country, it  is  clear  to  us  that
more needs to be done. We are therefore, as  I  have  said,  embarking  upon
this programme and we will soon be in a position to report progress in  this
regard as well.

As is well known, the TRC has now concluded its work and, as the  executive,
we have set aside slightly more than R800 million so that we can  deal  with
the issue of final reparations. [Interjections.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: When?

The MINISTER: The hon member asks ``when''.  This  is  indeed  going  to  be
pretty soon. It will  be  remembered  that  we  cannot  do  that  until  the
President has received the final report of the TRC and has presented  it  to
this House for debate by Parliament. This  will  be  done  as  soon  as  the
President has indeed received that report.

In anticipation of that we have indeed placed before  Cabinet  a  series  of
recommendations regarding what is to be done by way of ensuring  that  there
are reparations. [Interjections.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Oh, that is next year.

The MINISTER: I am not going to answer that one.  Mr  Chairperson,  the  hon
member should please shut up.

There is another question that we have to answer, and  answer  honestly  and
truthfully. That question is: As the TRC concludes its work, what do  we  do
with people who applied for and did not get amnesty  or  people  who  simply
did not bother to apply for it?  [Interjections.]  Maybe  hon  members  will
want to debate whether Adrian Hadland is right in observing:


  We as a nation have to decide whether we want to spend millions,  perhaps
  billions of rands, prosecuting those who have so far evaded  justice,  or
  whether we wish to use the  resources  for  other  pressing  things  like
  housing and health care. The Wouter Basson trial has  apparently  already
  cost more than R4 million.

In anticipation of such a debate and on the instructions of  the  President,
I have quietly started consulting some of the retired  generals  who  served
in the South African Police Service and the South African Defence Force,  as
well as some of the leaders of the parties represented in  this  House.  The
views  they  are  all  articulating  in   this   regard   are   interesting.
[Interjections.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: You kept moving the deadline  that  you  were  supposed  to
have applied.

The MINISTER: Mr Chairperson, please restrain this howler. [Interjections.]

Without going into the detail  of  the  recent  judgment  of  the  Transvaal
Division in the matter of Hermanus  Frederick  van  Rooyen  and  two  others
versus the State and seven others and venturing into  public  comment  on  a
matter which is still sub judice, I  need  to  point  out  that  I  have  no
intention whatsoever to interfere in judicial matters.

As indicated above,  I  have  long  initiated  a  process  to  look  at  all
impediments which hinder  the  independence  of  the  judiciary.  It  is  my
intention to promote the mainstreaming of the lower judiciary into a  single
judiciary. I have noted the contents of the  judgment  and  will  await  the
confirmation thereof by the  Constitutional  Court  before  considering  its
practical implications.

The demands and pressures to deliver in respect of  our  constitutional  and
legislative obligations and priorities  have  been  financially  challenging
for my department. With the recent  focus  on  consolidating  our  financial
affairs we are now in a position  to  ascertain  quite  clearly  our  budget
deficit in respect of urgent needs and minimum service delivery standards.

With the few seconds remaining I wish to  pay  tribute  to  the  late  Chief
Justice Ismael Mahomed, Judge D A Kotze and Judge H O Van Dyk,  as  well  as
Pieter Theron, a Wynberg  regional  court  magistrate,  who  have  left  our
service. I also wish to thank all members of  the  Justice  family,  ranging
from  members  of  the  South  African  Police   Service   to   prosecutors,
magistrates, judges, interpreters, court  orderlies,  Correctional  Services
and all members of our respective  departments  and  the  Ministers  leading
those departments. [Applause.]

Adv J H DE LANGE: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister,  Deputy  Minister,  members,
ladies and gentlemen, I rise in this debate on behalf of the ANC in  support
of the Vote of the Department of Justice.

I am delighted to report to the House that I  am  able  to  do  so  after  a
thorough and exhaustive investigation into all the aspects  of  this  budget
over a period of many  weeks.  This  investigation  has  included  oversight
functions of the committee, which included a week-long visit to  courts  and
justice structures in at least four provinces, a  week-long  study  tour  to
Germany and numerous public  hearings  with  the  whole  justice  family.  I
therefore express these views from a basis  of  thorough  investigation  and
analysis  and  not  generalisation  and  opportunism,  as  some  of  us  are
sometimes wont to do.

From time to time, our senses are assaulted  by  someone  opining  that  the
justice system - meaning the  courts,  the  prosecuting  authority  and  the
masters' offices - is totally dysfunctional, even that it is  on  the  verge
of  collapse,  or  has  totally  collapsed.  Such  opinions  make  good  and
sensational headlines but are  factually  challenged,  devoid  of  even  the
barest essential necessary to establish that rare commodity called truth.

Yes, it is true that our justice system and the courts face  problems,  even
huge challenges, but our  investigation  has  proved  incontrovertibly  that
each day of the week, throughout the length and  breadth  of  this  country,
all our courts are functioning, albeit with varying degrees  of  efficiency,
dispensing that elusive concept of justice.

It may not always be perfect justice, but as Andreas Sergio stated,  ``There
are no perfect conditions  for  justice  to  take  place''.  Transition,  in
particular, produces a special set of conditions for imperfect justice.  The
simple indisputable fact of the matter is that each and  every  day  of  the
week each  of  our  courts  sits  on  average  between  3,5  to  5,5  hours,
dispensing justice.

To deny this, or to make light of it, is  to  deny  or  denigrate  the  very
existence, the toil and sacrifices of the thousands  of  persons,  including
judges, magistrates and prosecutors, that make the  wheels  of  justice,  as
creaky as they may sometimes be, inexorably turn  every  day.  What  remains
for us to do is to dip our collective hats in salute and  tribute  to  their
sterling contributions and sacrifices and to  double  our  efforts  to  make
their tasks easier and more enjoyable in the future.

Looking back over the past seven years, the department  has  undergone  many
fundamental  and   far-reaching   changes,   encompassing   transformational
restructuring and rationalisation processes; and transforming the  apartheid
justice system, and the institutions underpinning it, into a justice  system
and institution serving a democratic and constitutional state.

This was always going to be a very long, painful process and  not  a  single
event. In the first seven years, the department has done much  of  which  it
can truly be proud. But, inevitably so, there have been  occasions  when  it
has not lived up to our expectations.
I recall a  few  of  the  more  memorable  highlights.  The  department  has
successfully amalgamated 11 departments into one department of justice -  11
systems of justice into one system of  justice;  established  nine  regional
courts to decentralise administration; and created a new senior  management,
including a  director-general  and  a  new  departmental  strategy,  Justice
Vision 2000. The equity and diversity profile of  the  department,  although
not yet complete, has gone a long way towards redressing the  inequities  of
the past.

The department has had a very busy period drafting legislation -  80  pieces
of legislation over seven years. There is also the establishment of  various
constitutional institutions, like the  Constitutional  Court,  the  Judicial
Service Commission, the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission,  the  Human
Rights Commission,  the  Public  Protector  and  the  Commission  on  Gender
Equality. Then there was  the  establishment  of  the  National  Prosecuting
Authority, including the Scorpions and the  Assets  Forfeiture  Unit,  which
have been established and have been exemplary in their  performance.  A  new
Legal Aid Board has been appointed under Judge Navsa, which has  allowed  us
to turn around an institution which has been terminally ill.

However, as could be expected when  such  large-scale  and  all-encompassing
changes are brought about, system failures are to be anticipated until  such
time as the new institutions, personnel, procedures  and  systems  have  had
occasion to iron out all the hiccups. In the department this has  been  most
apparent in the  arena  of  financial  management  and  administration.  The
reports  of  the  Auditor-General  and  the  financial  statements  of   the
department for the last few years reveal serious problems  relating  to  the
department's financial administration. In a nutshell, the last Scopa  report
lists four of these shortcomings.

The first shortcoming is unauthorised expenditure. It  was  stated  recently
that 50% of all unauthorised expenditure in Government  emanated  from  this
department. The reasons for unauthorised expenditure have been  analysed  in
detail  and  relate  to  goods  or  services  received.  The  main   reason,
therefore,  is  that  unauthorised  expenditure  takes  place   because   of
overexpenditure. In some isolated cases  the  correct  procedures  were  not
followed and this is not acceptable. There are certain  measures  that  have
been put in place to deal with this unauthorised expenditure  and  to  avoid
such unauthorised expenditure in the future.

The second problem concerns the deposit account, a trust account into  which
citizens pay their money, for example maintenance money,  bail  money,  etc.
Recently a 90% noncompliance finding was made by  the  internal  audit  unit
regarding the deposit fund, meaning that  no  reasonable  auditor  would  be
able to offer an  opinion  on  any  financial  statements  prepared  on  the
deposit account.  It  recommended  that  all  the  role-players  should  get
together and establish a task team to ring-fence this problem and deal  with
it once and for all. I do not deal with the other two problems.

The year under review has been characterised by an  in-depth  assessment  by
the Minister and the Director-General of Justice relating  to  delivery  and
administration in the department. This  assessment  has  culminated  in  the
adoption, during the year, of a  strategic  direction  for  the  department,
which has been explained in detail by the Minister. However, I  will  remind
members of a few of the points. Firstly,  a  board  of  directors  has  been
established within the Ministry. Secondly,  an  executive  committee,  under
the director-general, has been established in the department.  Thirdly,  the
core service  delivery  functions  of  the  department  are  established  as
business units, with a managing director heading  each  of  them.  Fourthly,
the support functions of the department have been  organised  into  business
units in the same manner. Fifthly, some further specific measures have  been
necessitated in the financial management and administration arena.

As indicated above, for a number of years the  financial  administration  of
the affairs of the department has, in many  respects,  been  declining.  The
position reached an untenable state in which management information was,  in
fact, misleading. The department was led to believe,  until  well  into  the
second half of the last financial year, that it  was  due,  once  again,  to
exceed authorised expenditure estimates by approximately  R180  million.  In
response to this advice, management took steps to limit  expenditure.  As  a
result of this, the current underexpenditure has, in fact,  occurred  which,
when audited, is likely to exceed R100 million by far. Most of  this  amount
has been committed and the Treasury has been requested to roll the sum  over
to the next year.

A rigorous  assessment  of  financial  processes  has  been  completed.  The
redesigning and implementation phases of  financial  support  services  will
complement the maturing needs of the business units as  they  progress  with
the implementation of approved  business  plans.  Each  business  unit  will
operate according to an approved business plan  that  will  see  it  setting
itself up as a self-contained  unit,  independent  of  head  office  support
services, as is the case with the National Prosecuting Authority. There  are
also other alternatives. The finalisation of the strategic direction of  the
business units, in respect of  support  services,  has  been  treated  as  a
priority matter.

With regard to the internal audit unit, the custodian  consortium  has  been
asked  to  extend  their  contract  with  the  department  for  the  current
financial year. In August this year the internal audit team  will  be  doing
follow-up work on the salary Bill that they have done so far. It  should  be
noted that  the  department  is  requesting  funding  to  enable  it  to  do
selective in-depth forensic audit work, as a result of  the  internal  audit
findings. This is based on a 20% sample of suboffices in  courts,  in  terms
of which 90% of internal controls  are  not  being  performed  by  suboffice
accountants. This needs to be addressed urgently.

In  terms  of   the   costing   unit,   the   recent   departmental   budget
reprioritisation task team and my committee applaud the Minister's  decision
to call for a costing and rightsizing  unit  in  the  office  of  the  chief
financial officer. The objective is to establish a footprint for justice  in
South Africa which is designed,  sized  and  resourced  in  accordance  with
prevailing crime  trends,  prosecutorial  requirements  and  other  relevant
facts; and which is also able to meet the changing demands  imposed  by  the
application of both criminal and civil justice in the country.

This unit will  calculate  the  cost  of  a  geographically  rightsized  and
standardised judicial infrastructure, or  footprint,  servicing  established
needs. This unit, in essence, will establish the cost from a zero base  that
the department will report against by way of a Base 80 technique  in  future
years. The Base 80 concept has been devised by  Mr  McKenzie,  the  CFO,  to
empower decision-makers to gain insight on  marginal  activities  that  have
been funded. More importantly, it will also inform, in advance, on  unfunded
priority needs. I will not deal with all the points. I am going  to  skip  a
few.

Costing from a zero base only needs to be done periodically.  Thus,  a  move
to activity-based budgeting, as called for in the PFMA, has  commenced  with
the preparation of the Base 80 budget, which has crisply  focused  attention
on the allocation of funding at the  margin  of  available  resources.  This
process has also highlighted the need for additional funding, and has  shown
where and why the  department  is  tied  to  the  prospect  of  unauthorised
expenditure in the current year, or to a phased implementation  of  priority
needs in future years.

Efficiency, effectiveness and productivity are severely hampered by  a  lack
of resources. Modernisation  is  critically  needed  to  deal  with  current
volumes. Until such time that there is a significant capital injection,  the
department will be forced to rotate the focus on critical baseline  matters,
which will result in little attention  being  paid  to  the  development  of
intellectual or tangible resources.

The department is playing a  leading  role  in  many  of  the  modernisation
processes in the criminal justice system cluster, including  the  Integrated
Justice System, e-Justice, the Court Process  Project,  the  DNS  and  other
projects. The  development  of  this  technology  platform  is  part  of  an
integrated  overall  interdepartmental  action  plan  to  ensure  that  this
significant investment is optimised. It should be noted, however,  that  the
skills base of the department needs to match this best in  class  technology
enabler.

The year under review has also seen the  birth  of  successful  initiatives,
such as the impact of Saturday courts, in reducing backlogs. A reduction  in
absenteeism, the progress of the Court Process Project, the  impact  of  the
Assets  Forfeiture  Unit,  anticorruption  successes,  the  impact  of   the
Scorpions, the launching  of  a  whistle-blowing  hotline,  etc,  have  been
celebrated on the one hand. On the other hand,  matters  such  as  the  poor
working  conditions  and  remuneration  packages  of  all   staff   in   the
department, including judges, prosecutors and  magistrates,  have  continued
to be of concern in relation to future  sustainable  excellence  in  service
delivery.

A joint initiative is under way with the  SA  Post  Office  to  explore  the
feasibility of establishing post office  outlets  within  the  courts.  This
initiative will focus on the deposit account system  and  will  explore  the
possibility of opening the total Post  Office  network  to  transactions  in
this respect. This pilot project has the potential of changing some  of  the
hardships faced  by  the  poorest  of  the  poor  in  effecting  maintenance
payments, and the initiative should be accorded the  necessary  priority  to
enable its piloting as soon as possible.

I will now deal with unfunded priority needs. The department has done an in-
depth budget reprioritisation. As has always been the case,  the  department
finds that the bulk of  its  expenditure  is  necessary  to  fund  personnel
costs. Over time, an unfunded backlog of priority needs has accumulated  and
is currently substantial.

This unfunded backlog is to be urgently unpacked with the Treasury  as  part
of an exchange of perspectives in order that a way  forward  can  be  agreed
to. By way of only a few examples, the following  illustrates  these  needs.
The sum of R41 million is to cover a shortage relating to non-funded  salary
increases granted to prosecutors and magistrates in terms  of  an  agreement
reached in  1999  between  the  Ministers  of  Justice  and  Finance.  These
salaries have never been funded.

The sum of R220 million is required to cover a  shortage  for  the  cost  of
employing 1 812 members of staff whose employment has been approved  by  all
the regulatory agencies required by the state. These posts are part  of  the
approved establishment but have never been funded.  The  Department  of  the
Public Service and Administration  has  also  approved  the  need  for  this
establishment.

Thirdly, R160 million is required to cover a shortage, as the department  is
not  meeting  the  legitimate  remuneration  entitlement  of  staff  in  the
department, and the department believes that the funding  of  the  shortfall
will go a long way to addressing morale. These costs are, in  part,  covered
by not filling approved funded posts which, in practice, adds to the  morale
and addresses capacity problems of the department.  I  have  given  a  whole
breakdown of all those figures, and how the R160 million is made up.

Legislation that is vitally important to  the  future  development  of  this
country  has  also  not  been  implemented.  One  thinks  of  the   equality
legislation, the assessors, the maintenance investigators and so forth.  The
department needs funding, for  example,  for  the  Equality  Act.  Some  R20
million is urgently needed for capacity-building activities,  including  the
functioning of the Equality Review Committee, infrastructure for the  courts
and appointments that are required to give effect to this  legislation.  The
need for maintenance investigators cannot  be  disputed.  Depending  on  the
priority accorded this matter, an amount of R20 million  would  provide  for
only one investigator only at 520 courts, at only senior clerk level.

The offices  of  the  Master  of  the  High  Court  are  badly  in  need  of
modernisation in respect of systems and processes,  and  attendant  capacity
building. To address this matter, at least R50 million is needed,  of  which
R15  million  is  absolutely  critical.  As  far  as  public  education  and
communications are concerned, a fraction of the  budget  goes  to  those  in
need, and further needs are experienced there.

From the aforementioned it can be seen that the call  for  the  Treasury  to
workshop these needs with the department and the committee is  necessary  as
a matter of urgency. I have gone into detail on these particular  shortages,
although there is a whole list of them and I can go on  for  another  while,
not to promote any one matter above the rest,  but  to  illustrate  that  we
cannot expect the department to deliver if we do not provide them  with  the
tools to do so. I thank the hon Mike Ellis.

In  conclusion,  in  relation  to  the  new  proposed  activities   of   the
department, I am convinced that the  department  remains  committed  to  the
requirement that the justice system must function well,  for  it  remains  a
cornerstone of our new democracy, and upon it rests the achievement  of  key
objectives such as legitimacy, stability and peace.
Secondly, the  department  will  respond,  within  the  limitations  of  its
resource base, to changing circumstances as they  may  arise  and,  thirdly,
the proposed new measures could  meet  the  various  difficulties  that  the
department has been experiencing, especially in the area  of  the  declining
financial management and administration capacity of the department.

In the past seven years, the foundations have been laid for  the  department
progressively to take service delivery in the justice  arena  progressively,
to increased levels of excellence. The future lies  in  converting  thoughts
into action. However, sight  should  not  be  lost  of  the  fact  that  the
implementation of these strategies developed over the past seven years,  and
were finetuned and amplified by these  more  recent  developments,  and  the
resultant transformation of the  department  will  be  a  long  and  arduous
process, rather than an event.

Lastly, I need to say a few thank yous. I need to say a very big  thank  you
to our Minister and to our Deputy Minister for their  excellent  leadership,
the advice that we are always provided with and the space they  provide  for
our committee to operate in. Secondly, I need to give a very big  thank  you
to all my committee members, particularly the opposition  party  members  as
well. I think we work together well as a team. We have our  differences,  we
have our fights, but that is all within the family. I  also  want  to  thank
you.

To the long-suffering ANC component, I can just say that he can get  rid  of
me at any time he  wants  to,  so  I  will  not  thank  him  too  much.  The
department I want to thank absolutely for the tremendous work  they  do.  We
want to congratulate Adv Pikoli and his team for  the  excellent  work  they
do. I thank the  agencies,  such  as  the  prosecuting  authority  under  Mr
Bulelani Ngcuka, the courts under Judge  Chaskelson,  the  Legal  Aid  Board
under Judge Navsa, the Human Rights Commission  under  Dr  Pityana,  and  so
forth.

I want to thank you all, and those that  I  have  not  thanked  must  please
regard themselves as thanked. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Could I ask  some  hon  members
on the far right please to join the main discussion?

Dr J T DELPORT: Mr Chairperson and Mr Minister, last year's hearings by  the
portfolio committee established the fact  that  the  Department  of  Justice
faced a crisis. The hearings this year concentrated  on  measures  to  steer
the department out of that crisis. I  want  to  congratulate  the  director-
general and his senior personnel for their realistic and frank approach,  as
well as the chairperson of the portfolio committee.

He set an example  of  critical  probing  and  has  extended  the  oversight
function of the committee beyond today. In fact, the committee will  receive
further reports in the months to come. The committee knows that the DA  will
support all measures that will improve our legal system and its efficacy.

The appointment of Mr McKenzie of Business Against Crime as Chief  Financial
Officer, has made a unique impact. The way  in  which  he  has  set  out  to
rationalise, to  introduce  control  measures  and  to  reprioritise  budget
items, is the single biggest factor  providing  light  at  the  end  of  the
tunnel.

I wish to give a clear undertaking to the hon  the  Minister:  Whenever  and
wherever he embarks on the correct route, the hon the Minister will find  us
supporting. May I also add, in all sincerity, that when we  offer  criticism
and when we come forward with proposals,  it  will  be  worth  the  hon  the
Minister's while to give serious consideration to these.

In  hierdie  gesindheid  van  positiewe  betrokkenheid  wil  ek  graag   vyf
belangrike sake aan die Minister voorhou.

Eerstens is daar die krisis in ons strafregstelsel. Dit is  algemeen  bekend
dat ons tans 'n agterstand van meer as 170 000 kriminele sake  opgebou  het.
Verder is dit ontstellend dat daar meer as 250 hangende  tugondersoeke  teen
landdroste  is  op  klagtes  wat  wissel  van  pligsversuim  tot   kriminele
skuldigbevinding. Die jongste nuus  is  dat  landdroste  aangekla  word  van
betrokkenheid by bedrog van baie miljoene rande.  Ons  beleef  inderdaad  'n
krisis.

Laat my egter dadelik byvoeg dat byna die helfte  van  alle  polisiedossiere
wat vir  vervolging  aan  die  aanklaers  oorhandig  word,  teruggetrekword.
Uiteindelik  eindig   net   10%   van   alle   gerapporteerde   misdaad   in
skuldigbevinding. As die strafsaak teen die  beskuldigde  egter  eers  begin
het, eindig meer as  75%  van  daardie  sake  in  'n  skuldigbevinding.  Die
statistiek bewys dus onteenseglik dat die kern van die probleem nie  by  die
vervolging lê nie, maar by die ondersoek -  en  dit  is  natuurlik  minister
Tshwete se verantwoordelikheid - en by die voorbereiding van die  saak.  Ons
moet op daardie aspekte fokus.
Ek wil positief wees. Ons het honderde  toegewyde  landdroste  en  aanklaers
wat onder spanning werk, wat ekstra diens lewer in hul  poging  om  ons  uit
die krisis los te ruk. Die departement is  ook  besig  om  'n  groot  aantal
stappe te doen, soos deur die agb Minister en die agb De  Lange  uiteengesit
is. Saterdaghowe is onder andere ingestel in  samewerking  met  die  private
sektor, en dit is'n sukses. In twee en 'n half  maande  is  2  100  sake  só
afgehandel. Ons wil egter tog aan die  Minister  'n  aantal  verdere  stappe
voorlê.

Eerstens, die begrotingsbedrag vir Justisie moet verhoog  word.  My  kollega
mev Camerer sal in detail oor hierdie aangeleentheid  praat.  Kortliks,  ons
het  meer  howe,  meer  aanklaers  en,  belangrik,   beter   administratiewe
ondersteuningstrukture nodig. Die Kabinet moet oortuig word om aan  Justisie
'n  hoër  prioriteit  toe  te  ken.  As  ons  nie   daarin   slaag   om   'n
strafregstelsel daar te stel wat  vinnig  en  effektief  strafsake  afhandel
nie, sal al ons pogings om die hoë ideale van ons  Grondwet  te  verwesenlik
tevergeefs wees. Die koste van die belegging in 'n  effektiewe  stelsel  sal
verdwerg  word  deur   die   verdienste   daarop,   naamlik   'n   verhoogde
vertrouensvlak in die toekoms van Suid-Afrika, hier  en  in  die  buiteland.
Dit het ons broodnodig.

Administratiewe dissipline moet in ons  stelsel  gehandhaaf  word.  Ons  kan
eenvoudig nie langer  onbevoegdheid,  nalatigheid  en  onverantwoordelikheid
duld nie. Die huidige dissiplinêre proses is omslagtig  en  het  byvoorbeeld
tot gevolg gehad dat, in  sekere  gevalle,  landdroste  vir  jare  op  volle
salaris geskors by die huis sit. Ons  stel  wetgewing  voor  wat  'n  streng
gedragskode daarstel en 'n spesiale hof instel  vir  vinnige  en  effektiewe
afhandeling  van  tugondersoeke,  soos  dit  die  geval  is  in   Duitsland.
Aanklaers behoort ook onder hierdie wetgewing te val.

Ons voorstelle gaan verder. Dit is nie moontlik  om  die  aanklaerskorps  te
inspireer om gedissiplineerd te werk as hulle in haglike omstandighede  moet
funksioneer nie, soos om met getuies  in  gange  te  moet  konsulteer  omdat
kantore ver van die hof is, om sonder  behoorlike  faksfasiliteite  te  moet
werk, en om nie  behoorlike  toegang  tot  'n  biblioteek  te  hê  nie.  Ons
rigsnoer moet wees: Gee hulle wat hulle nodig het, sodat hulle vir  ons  kan
gee wat ons vra. Ons moet ook hierdie benadering volg ten  opsigte  van  die
vergoeding van lede van die regbank  en  die  aanklaerskorps.  Ons  het  die
beste nodig en om die beste te kry, moet ons aanbod aantreklik wees.

Daar is ook aspekte van die hele proses wat verfyn moet word. Ek noem  slegs
twee: Die stelsel van pleitskikking of ``plea bargaining''  en  die  stelsel
van openbare verdedigers of ``public defenders''. Die departement het  reeds
met so 'n proses begin en ons vra vir die versnelling daarvan.

Laastens, die persepsie dat die stelsel die  misdadiger  bevoordeel  en  min
gevoel vir die slagoffer het, moet gehanteer word. Ons  kan  nie  langer  'n
stelsel duld wat toelaat dat 'n veroordeelde deur 'n administratiewe  proses
op parool vrygelaat word  nadat  'n  bevoegde  hof  al  die  versagtende  en
verswarende omstandighede oorweeg het, en op 'n gepaste  straf  besluit  het
nie. Die stelsel moet verander.
Ons is gereed met voorstelle vir  die  fonds  vir  misdaadslagoffers  en  'n
handves vir  misdaadslagoffers.  Hierdie  is  wat  volgens  ons  betref  die
verbetering  van  die  strafstelsel  teweeg  sal  bring.   (Translation   of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In this attitude of positive involvement I would like to present five  very
important issues to the Minister.

Firstly, there is the crisis in our criminal justice system.  It  is  common
knowledge that we have currently built up a backlog of  more  than  170  000
criminal cases. It is furthermore disturbing to note  that  there  are  more
than 250 pending disciplinary investigations against magistrates on  charges
which range from dereliction of  duty  to  criminal  convictions.  The  most
recent news is that  magistrates  are  charged  with  involvement  in  fraud
totalling many millions of rands. We are indeed experiencing a crisis.

However, let me immediately add: Almost half of  all  police  dockets  which
are handed to the prosecutors  for  prosecution  are  withdrawn.  Eventually
only 10% of all  reported  crimes  end  in  conviction.  However,  once  the
criminal case against the accused has started, more than 75% of those  cases
end in conviction. Statistics  therefore  prove  incontrovertibly  that  the
crux of the  problem  does  not  lie  with  the  prosecution  but  with  the
investigation - and this, of course, is Minister Tshwete's responsibility  -
and with the preparation of that case. We should focus on those aspects.

I want to be  positive.  We  have  hundreds  of  dedicated  magistrates  and
prosecutors who work under great pressure,  who  deliver  extra  service  in
their attempt to get us out of this crisis. The department is also  involved
in taking a large number of steps, as set out by the hon  the  Minister  and
the hon De Lange. The Saturday courts, among other  things,  implemented  in
conjunction with the private sector, are a success. Within two  and  a  half
months 2 100 cases have been finalised. We would, however, like  to  propose
a few additional steps to the Minister.

Firstly, the budgetary amount for Justice should be increased. My  colleague
Mrs Camerer will talk about this matter in detail.  Briefly,  we  need  more
courts,  more  prosecutors  and,  most  importantly  better   administrative
support structures. The Cabinet should be convinced  that  Justice  must  be
granted a higher priority. If we do  not  succeed  in  putting  in  place  a
criminal  justice  system  which  finalises  criminal  cases   quickly   and
effectively,  all  our  attempts  to  realise  the  high   ideals   of   the
Constitution would be in vain. The costs of the investment in  an  effective
system will be dwarfed by what it will be worth, namely an  increased  level
of confidence in the future of South Africa here and abroad. We  desperately
need this.

Administrative discipline should be upheld in our system. We can  simply  no
longer tolerate incompetence, negligence and irresponsibility.  The  current
disciplinary process is tedious and has had as a result, for  example,  that
in certain cases suspended magistrates were sitting at home receiving  their
full salaries for years. We propose  legislation  which  would  introduce  a
strong code of conduct and a special court should be established  for  quick
and effective finalisation of disciplinary investigations, as  is  the  case
in Germany. Prosecutors should also fall under this legislation.

Our proposals continue. It is  not  possible  to  inspire  the  prosecutors'
corps to be disciplined in their work if they have to function in  appalling
circumstances, such as, for example having to consult with witnesses in  the
hallways because their offices are too far away from the courts,  having  to
work without proper fax facilities and not having the necessary access to  a
library. Our guide should be the following: Give  them  what  they  need  so
that they can give us what we ask. We should also follow this approach  with
regard to the remuneration of members of the judiciary and the  prosecutors'
corps. We need the best and to get the best our offer should be attractive.

There are also aspects of this entire process which  should  be  refined.  I
shall mention only two: The system of plea  bargaining  and  the  system  of
public defenders. The department has already started  with  such  a  process
and we are asking that it be speeded up.

Lastly, the perception that the system is advantageous to the  criminal  and
has little feeling for the victim should also  be  dealt  with.  We  can  no
longer tolerate a system which allows a person who has been sentenced to  be
released on parole through an  administrative  process,  after  a  competent
court has considered all the mitigating and  aggravating  circumstances  and
suitable sentence. The system should change. We  are  ready  with  proposals
for the fund for victims of crime and a charter for victims of crime.  This,
in our opinion, is what will bring about  an  improvement  in  the  criminal
justice system.]

A second  issue  I  wish  to  deal  with  is  the  integrity  of  the  legal
profession. The DA calls on the hon the Minister to heed our advice in  this
regard and refrain  from  overzealous  interference  by  Government  in  the
affairs of the legal profession. The department  should  rather  assist  the
profession by creating a framework within  which  they  can  run  their  own
affairs.

An organised, strong profession is an important cornerstone  for  any  legal
system, but coupled with this concept, however, goes the strong  support  of
the DA for the idea of an ombudsman for the  legal  profession.  The  public
simply must have recourse whenever they are treated unfairly or suffer as  a
result of incompetence or negligence.

A third issue which warrants attention is the enhancement of  the  integrity
of the judiciary. The independence of the judiciary is a cornerstone of  our
democracy. The DA will at all times support appointments  to  the  judiciary
based on merit, in order that judges  and  magistrates,  by  their  ability,
qualifications and integrity, enhance the public's respect for and faith  in
our judiciary. Of particular importance is the recent  High  Court  decision
on the position of the magistry and the need to remove it from  departmental
and ministerial control. Subject to whatever the  Constitutional  Court  may
find, this needs urgent attention.

About the idea of a  single  judiciary  where  magistrates  will  be  called
judges, we merely wish to state that the first step is to rid  the  magistry
of the bad apples. In  any  event,  I  firmly  support  the  notion  that  a
position cannot give status  to  a  person.  A  person  gives  status  to  a
position.

One of the most serious criticisms that I level against this  Government  is
the disrespect for court judgments by some members of the executive  in  the
provinces. I have had quite a number  of  complaints  and  I  have  personal
experience of one such incident, where an MEC simply ignored a court  order.
This is intolerable. This is the height of disrespect for the  Constitution.
I intend to engage the President on this issue.

The fourth issue is corruption. Suffice to say  that  corruption  is  eating
away the backbone of the South African community. The  Constitutional  Court
has ruled that the Heath Special Investigating Unit is an instrument of  the
executive. The actions of the Government, or more correctly,  the  inactions
of the Government, have  convinced  the  DA  that  we  need  an  independent
institution to deal with public sector corruption.

We believe that South Africa's tarnished image can only be salvaged  if  we,
through legislation,  create  a  unit  that  is  truly  independent  of  the
Government, functions outside of any  state  department  or  indirect  state
control,  has  a  permanent  structure  with  its  own  administrative   and
investigative staff, has inherent jurisdiction to investigate and  prosecute
instances of corruption and may act on its own volition and must act upon  a
matter referred to it by Parliament, the Public Protector  or  the  Auditor-
General or upon prima facie evidence produced by a  member  of  the  public.
Government  has  up  till  now  failed  to  demonstrate   conclusively   its
commitment to fight corruption and to fight it even if  it  comes  close  to
home. It is time to do so.

'n Laaste kommentaar. Daar  is  sake  wat  dringend  afgehandel  moet  word.
Eerstens is daar die finalisering van die jurisdiksiegebiede  van  die  hoër
howe en die rasionalisering van die  hoër  howe.  Die  onsekerheid  kan  nie
langer voortbestaan nie.

Tweedens is daar die kwessie van vergoeding aan  slagoffers  van  die  stryd
van die verlede. Dit is steeds uitstaande. Die amnestiekomitee  blameer  die
Regering en die Regering blameer die komitee en intussen  kry  mense  swaar.
Dit is nie goed genoeg nie.

Derdens meen ons die lang lewe van die WVK en die  amnestieverhore  het  nou
aan 'n einde gekom. Ons bevlekte verlede en die ongelukkige gebeure wat  uit
die  konflik  gevloei  het,  moet  nou  uit  ons  sisteem   kom,   deur   'n
tydsbeperking te plaas op verdere vervolging.

Ek sluit af: Ubi ius prosperitas. [Waar die wet is, is voorspoed.]

Die Regering en die opposisie dra 'n swaar verantwoordelik. Baie  mense  wat
jonk was in die apartheidsjare vra die aanklagvraag: Waarom het  julle  niks
gedoen toe julle sien dinge loop verkeerd nie? Ons moet waak  dat  dieselfde
vraag nie eendag aan hierdie geslag gevra word nie, want so baie dinge  loop
verkeerd. Ons land se toekoms vra ons ernstige toewyding.  Dit  vra  geloof.
Daar staan geskrywe en baie mense sal verstaan as ek sê:


  Al sou die vyeboom nie bot nie en daar geen druiwe  aan  die  wingerdstok
  sou ... wees nie nogtans ...

[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[A last comment: There are  matters  which  should  be  finalised  urgently.
Firstly, there is the finalisation of the areas of jurisdiction of the  high
courts and the rationalisation of the high courts.  The  uncertainty  cannot
continue any longer.

Secondly, there is the question of compensation to victims of  the  struggle
of the past. This is still outstanding. The  amnesty  committee  blames  the
Government and the Government blames the committee and meanwhile people  are
struggling. This is not good enough.

Thirdly, we believe that the long life of the TRC and the  amnesty  hearings
has now come to an end. Our tarnished past and the unfortunate  events  that
have arose from the conflict should now come out of our system,  by  placing
a timeframe on further prosecution.

I conclude: Ubi ius prosperitas. [Where there is law, there is prosperity.]

The Government and the opposition carry a heavy responsibility. Many  people
who were young during the apartheid years ask  the  accusing  question:  Why
did you not do anything when you  saw  that  things  were  going  wrong?  We
should guard against the same question being put to our generation one  day,
because so many things are going wrong. Our  country's  future  demands  our
serious commitment. It calls for faith. It is written and many  people  will
understand when I say:


  Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit  be  in  the
  vines yet ...

[Applause.]]

Ms F I CHOHAN-KOTA: Chairperson, I am not sure why, but I am given half  the
time of the previous speakers to deliver my speech, but, taking a  leaf  out
of the department's book, I will certainly give it a bash.

Mr D H M GIBSON: She is twice as good as the rest of them together.

Ms F I CHOHAN-KOTA: I know. It should come as  no  surprise  to  members  of
this House that four out of eight speakers  in  the  ANC  will  today  speak
about the courts. As a portfolio committee and  particularly  from  the  ANC
side, we place a high premium on the efficient functioning  of  our  courts.
This is the point at which justice is delivered to our  people.  There  are,
however, many challenges to meet and the department  is  in  agreement  with
that.

In an assessment  of  its  administration  of  the  courts,  the  department
recognises the following weaknesses.

There is no sense that the court system operates from an assessment  of  the
future or has a focus on development that is positioned  to  meet  community
expectations optimally. The location of courts is historically  based,  with
some courts being underresourced and others underutilised. There appears  to
be a lack of responsiveness  to  the  interests  of  people  who  appear  in
courts. Budget costing and allocations do not  correspond  with  the  actual
requirement to perform the core functions of the department.  All  of  these
problems and more were experienced by members  of  the  portfolio  committee
when we visited the four provinces of Gauteng, the  Northern  Province,  the
Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal in April.

The new business unit court plan appears to be  a  good  initiative.  I  say
``appears to be'' because, firstly, it  has  not  been  finalised  yet  and,
secondly, there appears to be some gaps in it and I want  to  address  these
matters during the rest of my contribution to this debate today.

It is going to be absolutely crucial to the success of the plan  to  harness
the skills and experience on the ground, particularly in  regional  offices.
Before our visits, some of us shared the view  that  regional  offices  were
merely bureaucratic  structures.  Those  of  us  who  visited  Gauteng  were
pleasantly surprised at the selfless  commitment  of  the  people  who  work
there. Mrs Beryl Simelane, who is head  of  that  office,  deserves  special
mention. At the courts that we visited, she sometimes knew the  problems  of
the courts even better  than  the  chief  magistrates  themselves.  We  left
convinced that the regional offices  serve  as  a  vital  link  between  our
courts and the department. The  portfolio  committee  will  look  with  keen
interest to see how this interphase between  the  national  office  and  the
little court out in the western area is structured.

The plan of the department is to incorporate some forward  planning  in  its
restructuring. This is absolutely essential. But we must  not  underestimate
the fluid nature of administering justice. To quote an example, the  Kempton
Park court has within its jurisdiction our  biggest  international  airport.
Many of the transcontinental crimes such  as  the  illicit  smuggling  cases
occur there and are often referred to this court for  adjudication.  Accused
persons have appeared here speaking French,  Spanish,  Swahili  and  so  on.
This requires  specialised  interpretation  by  freelance  interpreters  who
charge by the hour. As cases can range from two  days  to  two  months,  the
extent  of  the  budget  of  that  court  cannot  be  accurately  predicted.
Therefore, the plan has to build in some elements of flexibility  that  take
care of the extraordinary factors which are ever prevalent  in  the  act  of
administering justice.

The plan is meant to take three years  to  operationalise.  There  are  good
reasons for this, not least of which is to ensure that things are in  place.
However, there must be a medium to short-term focus. In the medium to  short
term, there needs to be a review of all potential  security  flashpoints  in
our courts, a refining of  the  cluster  system  to  ensure  efficiency  and
workability, and a realigning of interdepartmental role-players.

On the issue of security, in Randburg we witnessed how friends and  families
of accused persons are able to  pass  cigarettes  and  other  items  to  the
holding cells from outside the court building.  This  is  a  major  security
threat and needs urgent attention,  particularly  because  there  have  been
some pretty nasty shoot-outs in that court.  In  Protea  witnesses  have  to
mill  around  in  the  central  courtyard  with  accused  persons  or  their
families. Magistrates and prosecutors have to do the same at great  risk  to
themselves. There are no holding cells  and  no  safe  storage  for  weapons
handed in by visitors. This particular situation is  quite  dire.  While  it
may take some time for the necessary infrastructural  changes  to  be  made,
there must be some urgent intervention by way of security control.

Coming  to  the  realignment  with  interdepartmental  partners  as  far  as
district surgeons are concerned, for some reason  Soweto  still  experiences
problems with access to district surgeons while in  Randburg  we  were  told
that there were no such problems. Is it not about time  that  we  looked  at
the possibility of training general practitioners in this kind  of  forensic
medicine and opening up this profession  to  allow  access  to  this  to  be
freely available?

There were some complaints that in some remote courts  social  workers  were
not readily available and this resulted in  more  people  having  to  occupy
holding cells. This is clearly unacceptable. It is with some relief that  we
look at the integrated  justice  centre  concept  which  is  presumably  the
blueprint of the plan. Mention  is  made  of  permanently  stationed  social
workers.  It  is  absolutely  critical  to  have  these  people  permanently
located, particularly in areas where the  presence  of  the  social  welfare
department is limited or nonexistent.

We were told by some magistrates that they were experiencing  problems  with
Correctional Services in getting awaiting-trial prisoners to court. We  have
called the director-general to appear before us as portfolio  committee  and
we understand that a  meeting  will  take  place  with  all  relevant  role-
players. We await with interest the outcome of this interaction.

The cluster system  was  presumably  introduced  to  bring  justice  to  the
people. In many instances this does not happen, particularly in  maintenance
matters. Where there are opportunities to devolve these functions ...  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, I  rise  on  behalf
of the  IFP  to  support  the  budget  of  the  Department  of  Justice  and
Constitutional Development before us today. The 2001-02 Justice budget is  a
simple and straightforward budget. It is tabulated  in  a  manner  that  one
knows what one has, can do and what one is short of.

The department has allocated an amount of R3,6 billion  for  2001-02.  These
figures represent a quarter of the entire main national  expenditure  Budget
of R258,3 billion. The R3,6 billion is R682 million more  than  the  revised
estimate for the 2000-01 financial year, which amounted to R3  billion.  The
main reason for this rise is the increased cost  of  R104  million  for  the
administration of courts  and  R97  million  for  the  National  Prosecuting
Authority. It also includes the R447 million for  auxiliary  and  associated
services.

Four new programmes need to be funded by the department. These  include  the
Judicial Service Commission and the  Magistrates  Commission  and  the  list
goes on. There are nine others which I will not deal with right now  because
some of us are aware of these programmes. It is obvious  that  in  order  to
meet  the  challenges  that  are  facing  the  Department  of  Justice   and
Constitutional Development, we need more funds.

I will not deal with the figures here,  but  will  attend  to  more  serious
matters and address these to the hon  the  Minister.  The  question  of  the
salaries of judges, magistrates, prosecutors and interpreters  is  a  matter
which we  seriously  need  to  attend  to.  We  want  to  make  these  posts
attractive and ensure that we do not lose quality  men  and  women  who  can
serve the department.

The issue of maintenance seriously needs to be addressed. The Act is  there,
but it is not fully implemented. An example is that  investigators  are  not
available  and  it  is  not  clear  who  should  deal  with  maintenance  in
magistrates' offices. We should also speed up the  appointment  of  managers
in  court,  as  the  hon  the  Minister  has  rightly  stated,  to  do   the
administration so that magistrates,  prosecutors  and  interpreters  are  in
courtrooms by 9:00 am. Let us live in the real world of  practical  reality.
Let managers manage, prosecutors prosecute and magistrates and  judges  hand
down judgments. Once again, we can remind ourselves that justice delayed  is
justice denied. Let us attend to practical things  and  rectify  perceptions
that  the  Department  of  Justice   and   Constitutional   Development   is
collapsing.

In respect of speeding up justice, here are some suggestions  that  we  want
to make. We recommend that South Africa  should  use  trial  by  camera  for
awaiting-trial prisoners. Prisoners then do not have to leave prisons to  be
tried. They are tried where they are and magistrates remain where they  are.
Let us use modern technology to speed up achieving  more  effective  results
as well as the efficient processing of cases.  This  is  necessary  for  one
simple reason and that is that cases tend to drag on for a long time  before
they are finalised.

This  burdens  the  Department  of  Correctional  Services  with   providing
accommodation to awaiting-trial prisoners,  and  also  causes  witnesses  to
lose faith and abandon their cases or  disappear.  The  protected  witnesses
soon get tired of being kept away from relatives  and  friends,  and  rather
seek release and abandon the case. The result is that the state has no  case
against such an awaiting-trial prisoner or prisoners when,  in  fact,  these
are hardened criminals. Is the Minister going to be the  Minister  who  will
finally bring the bottlenecks in Justice to an end? That  is  the  challenge
this Parliament gives to him.

In conclusion, let me turn to the  subject  of  reparations.  The  issue  of
reparations worries me a lot. The department still  has  a  budget  of  R800
million, left over from 1998, which they had not been able  to  spend.  This
means that the R190 million allocated for reparations in  this  budget  will
also remain unspent. An effective justice system is one of  the  pillars  of
democracy in the fight to maintain the rights of  citizens,  fighting  crime
and ensuring the orderly rule of law. It is therefore encouraging  that  the
department's budget has been increased by some R682 million.

It is encouraging to see that the budget  increase  will  be  spent  on  the
improved administration of  courts,  particularly  in  the  high  and  lower
courts;  better  prosecutorial  services   by   the   National   Prosecuting
Authority;  improved  legal  aid;  and  TRC  reparations.  It  is,  however,
worrying that the department  has  not  been  able  to  spend  more  than  a
fraction of the R800  million  that  had  been  budgeted  for  1998.  It  is
therefore highly impossible that the R190 million allocated for  reparations
in this budget will be spent. Let us see some action now!

court project. We believe that if this is successful, it could be  of  great
importance to society. Using  an  electronic  television  monitoring  system
could help to combat the theft of dockets.  It is  important  for  this  and

[This means that it will depend on how long a magistrate has been  in  court
and how many hours he has worked. This will turn the accused into  something
real thing, that is not the imitation.

I would like to say to the hon the Minister that he must pull up  his  socks
so that the Department of Correctional Services will really work and  be  of
service to people. [Applause.]]

Ms N MAHLAWE: Mr Chairperson,  hon  Ministers  and  members  of  the  House,
section 55(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of South  Africa  requires
the National Assembly to provide mechanisms to  ensure  that  all  executive
organs of state in the national sphere of government are accountable to it.

To maintain oversight of any organ of  state,  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Justice and Constitutional  Development  has  been  engaged  in  a  rigorous
exercise so as to meet this requirement. The Minister, the  director-general
and his officials, all Chapter 9 institutions, and last but not  least,  the
Judicial  Service  Commission  and  the  judges,  have  come   before   this
committee.  The  President  of  the  Constitutional  Court  described  their
appearance as an historical event. These are the people who understand  what
this Government is about. This shows a  commitment  by  all  those  who  are
involved, and a  desire  and  an  intention  to  provide  an  efficient  and
effective delivery of justice services to all, and to bring about a  unified
and transformed judiciary system.

For my purpose, I am going to concentrate on that most important vehicle  of
the  judiciary  -  the  courts.  We  have  different  court  systems  -  the
Constitutional Court, the Supreme Courts, magistrates' courts,  High  Courts
and regional courts - but I  shall  only  concentrate  on  the  magistrates'
courts. The importance of courts is shown by the fact  that  this  programme
consumes about 50,5% of the  resources  allocated  to  the  department.  The
chairperson  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development understood this when  he  proposed  that  the  committee  should
visit four provinces - KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng,  the  Northern  Province  and
the Eastern Cape - in April this year in order to assess  the  situation  on
the ground and also the progress of the department.

The committee made these collective observations. There is a dire  need  for
the speedy rationalisation and realignment of courts to ensure an  effective
and efficient judiciary system. Duplication of courts  in  some  areas,  and
the absence of courts in others,  especially  in  the  disadvantaged  areas,
hampers the work of the department  and  also  of  the  judiciary.  Computer
systems and general equipment  are  sadly  lacking  and  in  some  districts
courts are nonexistent.  Surplus  equipment  from  other  courts  should  be
channelled to those that have been disadvantaged  previously.  There  is  an
acute lack of accommodation and space in some courts,  especially  those  in
rural provinces.

There is a need for renovation and general maintenance of  buildings.  There
is a need for training of court interpreters in languages  relevant  to  the
eight particular provinces and ongoing in-service training for staff.  There
is low morale amongst staff and officials owing  to  insufficient  personnel
and low salaries. There are gender imbalances in  top  management  posts  in
some provinces. There  are  courts  where  there  is  not  a  single  female
magistrate or assistant magistrate. Of course,  in  the  Eastern  Cape,  one
area, namely Tsolo, was an exception. The senior magistrate is a  lady.  And
in Umtata there is an equal number of male and female magistrates.  This  is
commendable.

The most important and critical observation in most of the courts  is  their
slow implementation  or  nonimplementation  of  the  Domestic  Violence  and
Maintenance Acts. The Domestic Violence Act of  1998  provides  for  simple,
quick and cost-effective procedures to protect women and children. I do  not
have to quote statistics here to show how women and children  are  subjected
to domestic violence.

The promulgation of this Act, however, has been a feather in the cap of  the
ANC, but there are problems  with  its  implementation.  Magistrates  cited,
amongst other things, a lack of budget funds implementation and  a  lack  of
trained  personnel;  nonavailability  of  magistrates  and  personnel  after
hours, as a number of incidents occur on weekends; women being shy  to  open
up and come to give  evidence;  and  a  lack  of  support  for  victims  and
equipment for giving of in camera evidence by young victims.

Likewise, the implementation of the Maintenance  Act  has  similar  problems
and, in addition, the problem of men who cannot be traced  at  their  places
of work. Others require DNA tests, but  magistrates'  offices  do  not  have
funds for this.

However,  it  has  to  be  mentioned  here  that  after  the  committee  had
interacted with the department after the visits, it became clear that  there
were plans in place as a remedy in the short, medium and  long  term.  These
include constant monitoring of  the  implementation  of  the  Act;  creating
public  awareness  and  training  service  providers;   training   of   SAPS
officials, prosecutors, magistrates and clerks  of  courts  with  regard  to
both Acts; rolling out one-stop centres  to  deal  with  victims  of  sexual
abuse; magistrates and personnel to  be  available  after  hours;  and  that
local police will be  issued  with  lists  of  magistrates  on  duty.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Mr Chairperson, I would like to  congratulate  hon  Mahlawe
on her maiden speech, while the  Minister's  speech  raised  more  questions
than it answered on issues  like  amnesty,  the  TRC  reparations,  and  the
continued nonappointment of the chief justice ... [Interjections.]  In  this
connection, I would like to point out to the Minister, that  it  is  a  year
since the late great Chief Justice, Ishmael Mahommed, passed away and  still
the post remains vacant. I would have liked to tackle  these  issues  in  my
speech, but I only have 10 minutes. This is the Justice  and  Constitutional
Development Vote debate. We shall tackle that.

This budget shows that South Africa is not being well governed. The  justice
system sits at the centre of any society and  people  on  the  ground  know,
because they experience it every time they come across our  justice  system,
that we are not being well governed.

The Department of Justice is a very obvious example of bad  governance.  The
rising crime rate and the limping operation of our courts  bear  witness  to
that fact. This became very clear during the  past  three  weeks  of  budget
briefings to  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice.  To  his  credit,  the
director-general was  very  frank  about  the  management  failings  of  his
department, where the Auditor-General found a  90%  noncompliance  with  the
deposit account of that department. The director-general  also  acknowledged
that head office does not know what is happening on the ground.

One of the reasons why it has become so clear that  the  justice  management
system, in the past six years, has  been  a  disaster  -  and  the  Auditor-
General has been saying this annually over that period -  is  that  at  last
mechanisms have been put in place  to  do  proper  budgeting  and  financial
control in the department  through  the  intervention  of  Business  Against
Crime.

A Chief Financial Officer for the department, Mr  Alan  McKenzie,  as  other
speakers have pointed out, was recently appointed  on  secondment  from  the
private sector. He was chosen and his  salary  is  being  paid  by  Business
Against Crime. This is, surely, a unique arrangement, and  Business  Against
Crime deserves our thanks. But I guess crime has become such a  problem  for
business that  they  just  could  not  take  it  any  more.  Hopefully,  the
department's new board of directors on which these  businessmen  serve  will
make a difference.  The  Minister  also  deserves  credit  for  taking  this
initiative.

Mr McKenzie's new budgeting system, which has  got  to  the  bottom  of  the
department's various failures, holds  great  promise  and,  hopefully,  will
soon begin to bear fruit. Example of  the  department's  failure  to  budget
properly, which the new budgeting process has  brought  to  light,  includes
the R41 million for salary increases which have applied to  prosecutors  and
magistrates since 1999 but for which there has never been proper  budgeting,
and another shortfall of R133 million, also relating to personnel,  who  are
already in employment, but have never been budgeted for. Not to mention  the
incredibly wasteful expenditure relating to the R187  supernumerary  drought
relief workers in the Northern Province who should never have been  employed
by the Department of Justice and have cost the department R100 million.

Since 1994, the Department of Justice has been notoriously underfunded.  The
new process has now brought to light the full extent of this  by  showing  a
total of unfunded current priority needs, referred to by other speakers,  in
excess of R700 million. Shamefully, included in this figure is a  shortfall,
in the personnel budget, of R150  million  relating  to  last  year's  merit
increases, bonuses, overtime pay, leave gratuities and so on. These  amounts
have been earned and promised, but have not been paid to  the  officials  of
the department concerned, because they were not budgeted for.

Naturally this sort of backlog is a  big  contributory  factor  to  the  low
morale among staff in the department. We, in the DA, believe  that  this  is
outrageous and the Minister should take personal responsibility for  finding
the funds, so that these amounts can be paid to the staff in his  department
with the shortest possible delay.
The new budgeting process has clearly demonstrated, as the department's  own
budget document states, that there is ``a dire shortage of posts  which  has
resulted in severe personnel shortages, especially in  the  courts,  causing
serious backlogs in cases''. The need for 1 812 extra posts  was  identified
four years ago, and  that  includes  a  shortage  of  189  magistrates,  274
prosecutors and 227 interpreters. The total cost of  this  amounts  to  R220
million and has also been identified as an unfunded current  priority  need.
In fact, this budget demonstrates  a  shocking  90%  underfunding  of  human
resources requirements.

Initially, there was a mere  4%  increase  in  the  budget  for  our  courts
reflected in this department - the  core  function  of  the  department.  In
other words it was a decrease in real terms.  We  have  been  told  that  Mr
McKenzie's  reprioritising  exercise  is  going  to  change  this.  But  the
Minister must tell us what he is going to do about that.

These enormous and very specific  shortfalls  in  what  is  required  for  a
reasonably  functioning  court  system  have  now   been   demonstrated   in
accordance with the best accounting practices. He  has  the  ammunition,  he
sits on the Cabinet committee that makes these budget decisions and  justice
must be given a higher priority. The Minister has no place to hide  anymore.
Minister Manuel and the Treasury can no longer  be  blamed.  The  facts  are
there for all to see,  in  details,  and  the  Minister  himself  must  take
action.

The fact that the department is grossly underfunded and  under-resourced  is
an important contributory factor to South Africa's very low conviction  rate
in criminal cases. Perpetrators of serious violent crimes have  only  a  one
in 50 chance of being caught. A recently completed research showed that  out
of the 2,2 million crimes reported to the SAPS in 1998,  only  half  reached
the courts. One can point a finger at the SAPS for that failure, but of  the
remaining cases nearly half again were withdrawn  in  court.  And  of  those
cases that were heard, only 203 000 resulted in  a  conviction.  This  is  a
rotten record for our courts. [Interjections.]

Another result  of  this  under-resourcing  is  the  snail's  pace  of  both
criminal and civil cases through the courts.  The  huge  backlogs  at  South
Africa's busiest civil courts, for example Gauteng which handles nearly  40%
of all civil cases, are such that one  does  not  want  to  be  a  plaintiff
anymore. The lengthy delays favour the defendants,  as  the  Minister  knows
full well, so that one can truly question whether  the  citizen's  right  of
access to the courts is not being undermined by this bad governance.

The average time that an accused spent awaiting trial was 76 days  in  1996.
This has now nearly doubled to 131  days.  Approximately  50  000  awaiting-
trial prisoners - which is up from 29 000  in  1996  -  have  led  to  gross
overcrowding of  our  jails.  We  experienced  the  extraordinary  spectacle
during the budget hearing of the President of the  Constitutional  Court  no
less, describing to our committee the shocking conditions of  awaiting-trial
prisoners in Diepkloof  prison  and  making  an  impassioned  plea  for  the
department to do something about it. The Minister must tell  us  whether  he
as taken this to heart.

A further example of bad governance  typified  by  this  department  is  the
failure to  implement  legislation  that  was  rushed,  with  much  fanfare,
through Parliament, often because of the failure to cost and budget for  the
implementation, as has been made  very  clear  through  this  new  budgeting
process.

The typical example that is being quoted is the Maintenance Act,  which  was
passed three years ago, which provided for the  appointment  of  maintenance
investigators. This was billed as the key to the success of a new  deal  for
women. But not one has been appointed.  The  R35  million  needed  for  this
purpose is listed in the new budget as an unfunded priority need.

To  add  insult  to  injury,  it  seems  that  the  National   Director   of
Prosecutions has withdrawn all prosecutors from the  maintenance  courts  in
spite of the provisions  of  section  4  of  the  Act  that  stipulate  that
prosecutors are the maintenance  officers  at  courts.  It  seems  now  that
typists and clerks have been left in charge. The excuse given is that  there
are not enough prosecutors and no money to hire more. But surely this  ultra
vires administrative action of the national director is not good enough  and
must be rectified forthwith.

Again with regard to the equality courts, they have  not  been  implemented,
as has been  pointed  out.  There  are  many  unbudgeted  and  unimplemented
aspects of the domestic violence and witness protection laws.  All  in  all,
it makes for a really sorry picture.

On  the  positive  side  is  the  appointment  of  Mr  MacKenzie   and   the
introduction of proper budgeting and financial controls and,  of  course,  a
second positive factor is the disarming candour  of  the  Minister  and  the
frank admission of his officials, for the second year in a row  now,  as  to
the low morale in the department, the dilapidated state of  the  courts  and
the  underresourcing,  and  the  sincere,  though  thus  far   unsuccessful,
attempts to rectify matters. [Time expired.] [Interjections.]
Mr G B MAGWANISHE: Mr Chairperson and hon members,  I  can  say  with  pride
that despite the challenges we face we have begun the road to  the  mountain
top. Some of us might not be there when we reach the  mountain  top,  but  I
know that we will get to the mountain top.

When we have achieved our economic, social and political  freedom,  we  will
be able to hold hands and sing a freedom  song,  ``free  at  last,  free  at
last''. This is not an easy walk. We are faced  with  many  challenges,  but
they require of all of us to make an extra effort to get there.

I stand before my fellow South Africans  today  to  honour  them.  I  honour
those South Africans, especially young people, who  have  contributed  their
services free of charge, without expecting  any  remuneration.  They  derive
satisfaction  from  serving  their  people.  I   honour   them   for   their
determination to reach the mountain  top.  It  is  this  determination  that
makes me proud to be a South African.

There are, however, distractions on our road to the mountain top.  They  are
meant to appeal to our emotions so that we  concentrate  on  them  and  lose
focus on what we want to achieve as a nation. We cannot ignore them as  they
violate the right of our people to a free and secure environment. They  also
represent the fears of those who are still crying to go back  to  the  past.
We cannot, as a nation, accept that a small group of racists can  just  kill
and beat black people, and paint them white, just because they happen to  be
black.

It is painful  that  most  of  these  people  who  are  being  harassed  and
victimised are poor rural people, some of them women and young  people.  Let
me thank the media for continuously exposing these acts of terror.  May  the
souls of Tsepho Matloga and others rest in peace. I would  like  to  say  to
those who face race-related attacks daily that the nation is  with  them  in
their pain. The forces of evil cannot rule forever.

At the centre of this road to the mountain top is a justice system  that  is
efficient and dedicated. We cannot have  that  unless  we  have  good  human
resource management. Like the rest of our country our Justice department  is
transforming itself to meet these new challenges.

Some people say that to achieve results we  need  more  resources.  I  think
that is true. But I also  think  that  better  management  of  resources  is
important to yield better results. One does not have to solve  some  of  the
problems by allocating more money. There is  a  magistrates'  court  in  the
Northern Province, in the district of Malamulele, under  Magistrate  Chauke,
deep in the rural areas, that has very few resources. It is one of the  best
performing courts in that province. There are no  backlogs  in  that  court.
There are, however, courts  in  urban  areas  with  better  resources  which
perform more poorly.

The Justice department is  embarking  on  a  process  of  making  sure  that
magistrates concentrate  on  their  judicial  functions  and  administration
officers  are  employed  to  manage  courts.  This  will  make   magistrates
concentrate on what they are trained for. New procedures have  been  adopted
for the appointment of magistrates. These came  into  effect  on  1  January
2000. This procedure makes  provision  for  the  advertisement  of  regional
magistrates' posts in the media. It ensures that a wide  range  of  suitable
candidates can apply for appointment to positions.

The Justice department deals with people who are sometimes very  traumatised
and vulnerable. It is important that  training  is  intensified,  especially
amongst the  presiding  officers.  This  training  should  emphasise  social
context analysis, which is important when dealing with bail cases.

Since 1994 more blacks and women have been appointed to senior positions  by
the department and by the prosecutorial authority. We need  to  commend  the
leadership of the department and prosecutorial authority for that  and  urge
them to do more.

We  also  need  to  thank  Business  Against  Crime  for  working  with  the
department to improve the financial  management  of  the  department.  Their
contribution is highly appreciated by their fellow countrymen.

When we visited Potgietersrus we were impressed to find that  the  community
of that area participated in  the  discussion  of  issues  that  related  to
justice with court officials. We hope that this can be done  throughout  the
country. Justice matters are not matters only for the lawyers, but  for  all
of us. There can be no better life for all unless there is justice for  all.
[Applause.]

Mr J T MASEKA: Chairperson and hon members, we  are  seven  years  into  our
democracy, but little has been done to redress the imbalances of  the  past.
[Interjections.]

The Justice department is not doing enough to  make  justice  accessible  to
the people. Many people have to travel  long  distances  to  court,  passing
some courts that are nearer to their homes, because of  the  legacy  of  the
past. For example, people who stay at Bethani in  the  North  West  have  to
travel through Brits to Garankuwa, which  is  far  away  from  their  homes,
because of the areas of jurisdiction. This  is  not  the  only  place  where
people have to travel far from their homes to  go  to  court  while  passing
other courts. One may take Potgietersrus as an example.

Witnesses have to pay double for transport to Garankuwa  and  in  turn  they
must be paid witness fees. In some instances these witnesses  cannot  attend
court because of a lack of transport money,  which  result  in  cases  being
withdrawn due to a lack of evidence because of the absence of witnesses,  or
sometimes the case is delayed, causing a backlog, as courts do not  function
as they are supposed to. Witnesses are sometimes late for  court  and  cause
unnecessary postponements. The  UDM  urges  the  Government  to  restructure
courts as a matter of urgency to make justice accessible to  all  people  in
South Africa.

Another factor affecting the justice system is the shortage  of  prosecuting
personnel  and  related  resources  such   as   clerical   staff,   offices,
stationery, etc. In some instances prosecutors have no offices  and  consult
with witnesses in courtrooms in the presence of attorneys  and  the  public.
Enough prosecuting personnel and clerical staff should be  employed  without
further delay. Offices and office equipment should also be made available.

It should also be noted that some members of the public have volunteered  to
do clerical work and also to help with the payments  of  maintenance  money,
and they have no proper training. This is a matter of  serious  concern  and
the result of this type of practice is the recent conviction of a  volunteer
for theft of maintenance money at the Garankuwa magistrates' court. In  most
courts these volunteers  who  have  no  proper  training  attend  to  family
violence cases and this needs urgent attention by the Justice department.

It is also a further concern to the UDM that mothers and  other  people  who
collect maintenance and child grant money from  magistrates'  court  offices
are exposed to the weather. They stand in long queues without  shelters  for
a long time, if not the whole day, before they can be helped. Court  holding
cells are unhygienic and too small to keep large numbers of prisoners.

The UDM commends the men and women in the Justice department, in  particular
those who volunteered to work without pay on Saturdays  in  various  courts,
to reduce the backlog of cases. This has led to good results  as  cases  are
being finalised speedily. The UDM supports the budget and demands  that  all
vacant posts in the Justice  department  should  be  filled  with  immediate
effect. The UDM supports the Vote. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  please  lower  your
voices.

The  DEPUTY   MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson,  colleagues,  comrades,  friends,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  and
guests of the Justice department in the House, before I  continue  with  the
main body of my speech I would like to remind this  House  that  it  is  Mrs
Camerer's legacy as a former and failed Deputy Minister of Justice  that  we
are busy mopping up, and thus the mess. [Interjections.] [Applause.]  I  now
continue.

It is now widely understood that the department's key overall  objective  is
to achieve a just and equitable society in which all have  equal  access  to
justice. We also  all  know  that  this  requires  a  continual  process  of
substantive legislative and judicial reform. As  in  every  department,  the
budget process is therefore both a tool and a constraint. We must  link  the
budget and the programme of transition in such a way that we make  the  most
of what we have. Prioritisation is never easy when needs are  pandemic.  But
these choices have to be made, and they  must,  of  necessity,  reflect  the
policies that inform and guide the chosen implementation strategies.

The  transformation  of  our  department  and,   indeed,   of   the   entire
administration of justice is based on the understanding that if  we  are  to
succeed in achieving our objectives, those  most  excluded  from  access  to
justice in the past must be the primary focus of our attention.  The  budget
tool must be used to their advantage. In terms of human resources and  human
capital, we will continue to  pursue  a  policy  of  affirmative  action  in
striving to achieve a fully representative  judiciary  and  justice  system.
Transformation objectives will remain elusive until we  achieve  a  judicial
and justice system that is both responsive to and aware of  the  context  in
which that system is located and  operates.  The  same  must  apply  to  the
allocation of financial resources.

In terms  of  capital  expenditure,  we  will  continue  to  concentrate  on
providing facilities that enhance access to  justice  in  those  areas  that
have, until now, failed to benefit from infrastructural development and  the
provision of even the most basic services and  facilities.  The  empowerment
and development choices that we make  now  are  not  merely  a  response  to
political and constitutional  imperatives.  They  are  good  business,  they
reflect sound management decisions and practices,  and  promise  to  improve
the quality of life for all citizens, freeing the potential of each person.

We remain convinced that the development of the  most  disadvantaged  within
our communities will empower and strengthen our society as a whole. In  this
vein, we have what I refer to as the practical  implementation  handbook  of
the Constitution. The national action plan for the promotion and  protection
of  human  rights  provides  the  practical  blueprint  for  developing  and
entrenching a rights-based Government founded on fairness, transparency  and
equity.

As the lead department in this process, Justice  has  sought  to  strengthen
the co-operative and interactive nature  of  the  project,  with  input  and
participation from every Government department. To this end, we have set  in
place a fully interactive website that allows for  human  rights  monitoring
and reporting throughout government. The  National  Action  Plan  for  Human
Rights requires collective  intergovernmental  action  to  ensure  that  our
fundamental human rights, as set out in Chapter 2 of our  Constitution,  are
fully developed and  implemented,  and  that  these  rights  are  rigorously
maintained.  After  assessing  the  project  for  overall  performance,  the
Finnish government has generously agreed  to  renew  funding  for  two  more
years. By that  time  the  programme  will  be  fully  integrated  into  our
departmental budget for ongoing implementation.

As the department continues to give effect to the  principle  of  integrated
governance, joint programmes with institutions outside the  department  have
contributed to some noteworthy service delivery successes. In  this  regard,
the Legal Aid Board's delivery of 60 justice  centres  within  a  three-year
timeframe will have a profound effect on access  to  justice.  Reflecting  a
real break from our judi-care  past,  these  justice  centres  will  provide
assistance to the poor and indigent in both criminal and civil matters.

Two weeks ago  I  opened  a  joint  Legal  Aid  Board  and  justice  college
workshop, aimed  at  developing  the  skills  of  justice  centre  officials
working with children who are  in  trouble  with  the  law.  The  resounding
success of this workshop has necessitated that justice  college  mainstreams
this programme into  its  already  wide  range  of  training  and  education
courses.

Another example of  improved  service  delivery  is  at  the  Phuthaditjhaba
justice centre. After just 30 days in operation, this centre  has  taken  on
over 300 cases. This is an astonishing achievement, especially  in  view  of
their exceedingly limited marketing budget. Word of  mouth  has  spread  the
news for the people of Qwaqwa, and access to justice has become a  real  and
living right.

To further improve the administration of justice in Qwaqwa,  the  department
is assessing the  feasibility  of  establishing  a  small  claims  court  in
Phuthaditjhaba. At this point I  would  like  to  thank  all  those  private
practitioners  who  serve  free  of  charge  in  our  small  claims   courts
countrywide.  Their  contribution  to  the  administration  of  justice   is
invaluable. This example of private-sector co-operation with  Government  is
proof indeed that ventures of this kind  enhance  our  capacity  to  deliver
improved service on a sustainable and enduring basis.
In response to the special needs  of  women  and  children  as  victims  and
survivors of domestic and sexual violence, the department,  in  a  dedicated
programme of specialised service delivery,  has  over  the  past  two  years
established 19 fully functional sexual offences  courts  countrywide  and  a
further 12 are planned for the upcoming financial year.  We  have  developed
extremely sophisticated protocols for dealing with victims and survivors  of
sexual offences, and will continue to perfect best  practice  standards  for
this important area of service delivery.

The Thuthuzela care centre, located at  the  Jooste  Hospital  on  the  Cape
Flats, brings specifically trained investigators, prosecutors  and  forensic
medical practitioners together, as soon as possible after the violation  has
been reported, at any of the three police stations servicing the area.  This
integrated and cross-sectoral response to the problem  has  resulted  in  an
80% prosecution rate for the centre. The astonishing aspect of this  project
is that it has required a minimal injection of infrastructure  and  capital.
The project is built on the  resolve  of  the  participating  investigators,
prosecutors, doctors and community volunteers  who  make  it  work.  Similar
projects will be implemented during July  at  the  Indlaza  care  centre  in
Umtata, and at the Cecilia Makiwane care centre in Mdantsane.

We recognise that until the roll-out programme for  sexual  offences  courts
is complete, access to these specialised services will be limited  over  the
short to medium term. Accordingly, the department has  provided  178  courts
with closed-circuit video equipment and  31  with  one-way  glass  testimony
rooms for victims of sexual and other abuse.  In  this  area  of  work  much
remains to be done, and the number of victims  who  still  suffer  secondary
victimisation  in  our  courts  is  a  matter  of  extreme  concern  to  the
department. Our response  has  to  be  and  is  increased  capacity-building
through  ongoing  training  and  education,  and  an  incremental  plan   of
infrastructural delivery.

Before I move on, I must make special mention of  the  sexual  offences  and
community affairs unit in the  National  Prosecuting  Authority.  They  have
made huge strides in co-ordinating and developing an intersectoral  strategy
that covers both preventive and reactive management mechanisms.

The new domestic violence legislation, implemented since December 1999,  has
provided a real remedy for children, women and men who  become  victims  and
are  survivors  of  domestic  violence.  In  fact,  the  response  has  been
overwhelming and our courts can barely keep  up  with  the  demand.  In  the
Wynberg magistrates' court in the Western  Cape  alone,  there  were  5  706
applications during the year 2000. For 2001 the number  of  cases  currently
stands at 2  778,  although  this  number  includes  applications  from  the
Philippi court.

We are only halfway into the year, so the prospects  are  that  this  number
will double. We will continue to provide ongoing training and education  and
expand the number of service delivery  points.  However,  while  our  courts
continue  to  experience  the  current  levels  of  staff   shortages,   the
challenges  for  improved  service  delivery  will  remain  only   partially
realised.

Now, turning to family courts, the implementation of five provincial  family
service centres over the past  three  years  has  laid  the  foundation  for
determining best practice in this important  branch  of  our  legal  service
provision. Inadequate  staff  levels,  again,  severely  constrains  service
delivery in these courts, but the importance of the work  being  done  there
cannot be ignored. As the structural and institutional parameters  for  this
project are finalised, the department plans to extend  current  services  to
the remaining four provinces, while long-term prospects  for  these  centres
will see their gradual expansion into the lower courts' system.

I would now like to spend a few moments on our directorate of  children  and
youth  affairs,  which  was   established   last   year   to   oversee   the
implementation of section 28 of the  Constitution,  the  Convention  on  the
Rights of the Child, the African Charter on the Rights and  Welfare  of  the
Child and other relevant human rights instruments pertaining to children.

During the recent  Child  Protection  Week,  the  directorate  launched  the
interim national protocol for the management of children awaiting trial  and
a plain language guide to the United Nations Convention  on  the  Rights  of
the Child, which was ratified by South Africa in 1995. The latter, we  hope,
will empower our children to claim and realise their rights and to  gain  an
understanding of the responsibilities of being an active participant of  our
constitutional democracy.

Maintenance is another important  responsibility  of  the  child  and  youth
affairs directorate.  In  conjunction  with  the  revised  service  delivery
programme,  we  will  strive,  over  the  next  two  years,  to  provide  an
electronic  maintenance  system  that  allows  people  to  pay  and  collect
maintenance at a significant  number  of  outlets  outside  our  courts.  As
mentioned by the hon De Lange, negotiations with the Post Office  are  under
way to investigate the  feasibility  of  providing  payment  and  collection
points at their many  service  centres.  However,  we  cannot  improve  this
system on our own. As a community, we must begin to  name  and  shame  those
parents who wilfully neglect their families in this way.

In conclusion, let me return to the overall issue of  targeting  the  impact
of our budgetary tools on those who are in greatest need. As we develop  and
improve our management information system, we will be able to  sharpen  this
focus even further. We will  continue  to  ensure  that  our  resources  are
directed  at  relieving  the  plight  of  the  poor  and  the  marginalised,
especially women and children.

The recent appointment of our  Chief  Financial  Officer,  and  the  planned
establishment of a budget project office and a  costing  centre  augur  well
for our future. I am confident that our budget will become  an  increasingly
sophisticated mechanism for achieving change where it  is  most  needed  and
where those most in need will derive most benefit.

Finally, I would like to  thank  the  Minister  for  his  encouragement  and
support. So, too, should my adviser  and  the  officials  in  my  office  be
thanked for their support and unflagging dedication. My thanks must also  go
to  the  director-general,  the  deputy  directors-general,   the   National
Director of Public Prosecutions and the entire Justice family.

A special message of thanks must also go to the nonexecutive members of  our
board, who assisted without  any  remuneration  in  guiding  the  department
through its restructuring  process.  They  have  added  real  value  to  our
processes and we look forward to a long and enduring  partnership.  I  would
be failing in my duty if I did not recognise the  sterling  efforts  of  the
Portfolio Committee on Justice, and in this regard, I  would  like  to  make
special mention of the committee chair, Adv Johnny de Lange. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairman, hon Minister and Deputy Minister, it  is  undeniable
that the judicial system sits at the very centre of a nation's  affairs.  As
Christian democrats,  we  understand  that  the  purpose  of  government  is
primarily to  punish  and  restrain  evil,  to  protect  life,  liberty  and
property, and to provide justice for all people, using  God's  Word  as  the
standard.

Last year, I stated that the  South  African  criminal  justice  system  was
struggling to cope, and that without an adequate system of  law  enforcement
and criminal prosecution, the danger existed that the high levels  of  crime
and violence would become institutionalised in  the  social  fabric  of  our
society. I am more convinced of  this  truth  today,  despite  the  laudable
attempts by the department to address shortcomings.

Mr Ngcuka, the National Director of Public Prosecutions, has stated that:


  It should be quite clear to an offender that if he commits a crime, there
  is a very strong possibility that he will be arrested,  tried,  convicted
  and sentenced to serve a very  substantial  period  of  the  sentence  in
  prison.

This, unfortunately, is not the case where there is a perception that  crime
does pay, and in the event that an offender is apprehended, there is a  good
chance that the case will be withdrawn. Where there is  sufficient  evidence
to warrant a prosecution, the case  is  placed  at  the  rear  of  an  ever-
increasing backlog of court cases.

Whilst we  applaud  the  attempts  by  the  department,  the  judiciary  and
prosecutors to address  court  backlogs,  particularly  the  Saturday  court
initiative, we note with alarm that the backlogs in  district  and  regional
courts have increased. It is very apparent that we require penal  reform  in
our country. In this regard, the concept of restorative  justice  should  be
more  fully  embraced.  The  appeal  of  the  restorative   justice   model,
particularly when considered against the huge backlog of criminal cases,  is
the acceptance of blame by the offender, which is almost a plea  of  guilty,
and the recognition of the need to make restitution to the victim.

The  restorative  justice  approach,   which   incorporates,   inter   alia,
diversion, which keeps youngsters out of jail,  is  also  intrinsic  to  the
long-awaited child justice Bill and we as the  ACDP  would  in  this  regard
inquire from the hon the Minister when the portfolio  committee  can  expect
the child justice Bill to be tabled, and whether it will be fast-tracked.

The appointment of  Mr  McKenzie  from  Business  Against  Crime,  with  his
business management approach, appears  to  be  showing  dividends.  For  the
first time business costing units will be employed to ascertain whether  the
department is receiving value for money, and is in turn providing value  for
money to the public.

We trust that Mr McKenzie's budget for success, costing and business  units,
and business managers will result in a financial turnaround. We commend  the
director-general and the department for this step. It  is  for  this  reason
that, notwithstanding the difficulties and challenges I have set out  above,
the ACDP will support this Vote.
In conclusion, I wish to commend our chairperson, Adv Johnny de  Lange,  for
the hands-on approach adopted during this budgetary process. I do not  think
that any other portfolio committee has considered  its  department's  budget
in such detail as the Portfolio Committee on Justice has done over the  past
number of weeks. [Applause.]

Mr J S MGIDI: Mr Chairperson, the generally  impressive  sociopolitical  and
economic development of our  country  since  the  advent  of  democracy  has
unfortunately been marred by the simultaneous increase in crime,  especially
violent and organised crime. I can tell the hon  Sheila  Camerer  that  this
ANC Government, Madam Sheila Camerer,  was  the  first,  and  still  is  the
first, to declare that the current levels  of  crime  in  this  country  are
unacceptable and disturbingly high. There is no doubt that  all  of  us  and
all of our communities agree in unison that this scourge of  crime  must  be
dealt with decisively as a matter of urgency.

Crime is one issue which needs to be lifted above all political, racial  and
class considerations. I would, in fact, hasten to say that if there  is  any
issue with regard to which there is  a  need  for  what  the  President  has
referred to as ``unity in action for  change'',  it  is  the  fight  against
crime. In our collective endeavour to fight crime, conscious recognition  by
all of us of the centrality of an  effective,  efficient,  swift,  impartial
and credible justice system becomes particularly paramount.

This visionary ideal finds expression in, among other  things,  section  179
of our esteemed Constitution, in terms of  which  the  National  Prosecuting
Authority was established and its powers clearly defined. Our  Constitution,
the National Prosecution Authorities Act, the Prevention of Organised  Crime
Act, the Firearms Control Act, the Domestic  Violence  Act  and  many  other
pieces of legislation all constitute the fundamental legal manifestation  of
a country's and a government's commitment to combating crime.

Giving impetus to the ideal of and the Government's commitment  to  creating
a crime-free society,  the  President  in  his  state-of-the-nation  address
earlier this year had this to say:


  We want to arrive at a situation where those who commit crime  will  know
  that they have nowhere to hide.

I wish to add that the establishment of a  separate  prosecution  authority,
the Assets Forfeiture Unit, the  Scorpions  and  the  soon-to-be-established
Financial Intelligence Centre, the message to  the  criminals  becomes  even
clearer: crime  does  not  pay.  This  obviously  puts  the  commitment  and
intention of Government to eliminate crime beyond question. This  Government
continues to prioritise high-crime areas, namely  organised  crime,  violent
crime, urban terrorism, corruption, cross-border crime, crime against  women
and children, and social crime prevention.

We acknowledge that the process of combating crime does not end  but  begins
with the apprehension or arrest of crime suspects and  includes  successful,
effective and expeditious  prosecution  of  suspects.  This  fact  puts  the
National Prosecution Authority at the centre of crime prevention.  There  is
no doubt that the NPA and related  agencies,  like  many  newly  established
institutions, have had  their  own  share  of  teething  problems.  However,
looking at the short history of their existence and  the  impact  they  have
made in the criminal justice system, this Government  has  every  reason  to
declare publicly that there is hope in this country. Crime  is  not  out  of
control  and  this  Government  is  governing  the  country  properly.   The
Government's offensive against criminals is gradually  but  surely  becoming
too heavy for the criminals to withstand.

The  NPA's  impressive  improvement  of  prosecutors'  overall  performance,
leading to the courts sitting for at least four hours  a  day,  the  use  of
rescue missions in  dealing  with  case  backlogs,  including  the  Saturday
courts to which  the  Minister  has  referred,  all  constitute  a  dramatic
strategy to deal with the reduction of case backlogs.

Based on cases that were  brought  before  the  courts  and  for  which  the
Department of Justice is in fact accountable, and contrary  to  the  wishful
claim of others that the conviction rate is  decreasing,  we  are  convinced
that since the advent of democracy in this country the conviction  rate  has
increased to over 80% in the district courts, 65%  in  the  regional  courts
and 77% in the high courts. These figures characterise the  shining  success
story that the NPA resembles.

The Scorpions and the Asset Forfeiture Unit continue to break  the  backbone
and shatter the havens of organised and other  serious  criminals.  We  have
all seen how the  political  violence  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  as  well  as  car
hijackings and drug trafficking in Gauteng were brought  under  control.  We
have all seen successes.  We  have  seen  how  Scorpions  dealt  with  urban
terrorism in the Western Cape. These are but a few highlights.

We acknowledge the fact that  as  a  result  of  paying  more  attention  to
violent and other serious crimes, less attention  was  given  to  commercial
crimes. This resulted in some backlog in this area, but things are  changing
now. The Pretoria-based commercial crime unit, whose area of operation  will
soon be extended to cover other major centres, is  a  hope-giving  expansion
of focus.

The Sexual Offences and Community Affairs Unit, whose primary  objective  is
to  prioritise  gender  crimes  and  to  reduce   secondary   victimisation,
continues to make a positive impact on the lives of our people.  We  are  on
course and there is great hope for a better life for all our people.  As  we
have added some momentous impetus to the historic celebration of the  heroic
16 June youth uprising, I think it is fitting to  declare  once  more  today
that there is hope in this country and that we are on course. [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Chairperson, I wish to quote the following from  the  Interim
Constitution of 1993 with regard to national unity and reconciliation:


  The pursuit of  national  unity,  the  wellbeing  of  all  South  African
  citizens and peace requires reconciliation between the  people  of  South
  Africa  and  the  reconstruction  of  society.  The  adoption   of   this
  Constitution lays the secure foundation for the people of South Africa to
  transcend the divisions and strife of the  past,  which  generated  gross
  violation of human rights, the transgression of  humanitarian  principles
  in violent conflicts and a legacy of hatred,  fear,  guilt  and  revenge.
  These can now be addressed  on  the  basis  that  there  is  a  need  for
  understanding but not for vengeance, a need for reparation  but  not  for
  retaliation, a need for ubuntu but not for  victimisation.  In  order  to
  advance such reconciliation and reconstruction, amnesty shall be  granted
  in respect of acts, omissions  and  offences  associated  with  political
  objectives and committed in the course of the conflicts of the past.

This provision was also taken up in the new Constitution in  terms  of  item
2(2) of Schedule 6. The quote  comes  from  the  postamble  of  the  Interim
Constitution and it conveys positive words and sentiments for making  a  new
beginning. Where are we today? What happened to those positive sentiments?

The prosecuting authority has started to  prosecute  persons  who  have  not
received amnesty or have not applied for amnesty. The FF is of  the  opinion
that the whole issue of amnesty has been dealt with in a very appalling  and
bad manner. The TRC has come to the end of its life and yet we still do  not
have the truth and we still do not have reconciliation.

Hoe is amnestie die afgelope 11 jaar gehanteer? Die  De  Klerk-regering  het
amnestie verleen aan duisende ANC-ondersteuners. Geen  Norgard-beginsels  is
toegepas nie en geen amnestieverhore is gehou nie. Ingevolge die  Record  of
Understanding tussen mnr Ramaphosa en mnr Roelf Meyer word amanestie aan  'n
verdere 168 persone verleen,  waaronder  mense  wat  soveel  as  ses  moorde
gepleeg het, of sommige wat polisiemanne vermoor het.  Weer  eens  was  geen
Norgard-beginsels ter sprake of is name in die openbaar gepubliseer nie.

Toe volg die WVK-proses. Dit het onder andere die volgende resultaat  gehad:
Die  moordenaars  van  die  Heidelberg-taverne  het  amnestie  verkry;   die
moordenaars van die aanval op die St James-kerk  het  amnestie  verkry;  die
moordenaars van Amy Biehl het amnestie verkry; die planter van  die  bom  in
die Magoo's Bar het amnestie verkry. Maar Clive Derby-Lewis en Janusz  Walus
het geen amnestie verkry nie; Jaco Badenhorst en ander Afrikaners  het  geen
amnestie verkry nie; en dieselfde geld vir baie lede van die IVP wat  vandag
nog in die tronk sit. En nou? Die vervolgingsgesag begin  nou  om  mense  te
vervolg. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[How has amnesty been dealt with over  the  past  11  years?  The  De  Klerk
government granted amnesty  to  thousands  of  ANC  supporters.  No  Norgard
principles were applied and no amnesty hearings were held. In terms  of  the
Record of Understanding between Mr Ramaphosa and Mr Roelf Meyer amnesty  was
granted to an additional 168 persons, including persons  who  had  committed
as many as six murders, or some who had murdered policemen.  Once  again  no
mention was made of Norgard principles, nor were names published.

Then came the TRC process. This had the following results, inter  alia:  The
Heidelberg Tavern murderers were  granted  amnesty;  the  murderers  in  the
attack on St James church were granted amnesty; the murderers of  Amy  Biehl
were granted amnesty; the person who planted the bomb  in  Magoo's  Bar  was
granted amnesty. But Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz  Walus  were  not  granted
amnesty; Jaco Badenhorst and other Afrikaners were not granted amnesty;  and
the same applies to many members of the IFP who are  still  in  prison.  And
now? The prosecuting authority is now starting to prosecute people.]

Today the Minister asked the question: What do we do  with  people  who  did
not apply for amnesty or applied and did not get amnesty?  Do  we  prosecute
them and spend millions or do we put the money to more positive  use?  There
is, however, a more difficult question. What do we do with people  who  have
applied for amnesty, whose amnesty was turned down, but  who  are  still  in
jail today? We all know that the things they did were omissions or  offences
associated with political objectives and were committed  in  the  course  of
the conflicts of the past, as the postamble originally stated.

In Sondag se Rapport word berig dat daar 'n gesprek aan die gang  is  tussen
die Minister en sekere generaals rondom hierdie probleem. Die VF  ondersteun
hierdie inisiatief,  maar  laat  daar  geen  twyfel  wees  nie:  Indien  ons
uitsonderings begin maak om mense amnestie te gee wat òf nie aansoek  gedoen
het nie, òf wat aansoek gedoen het en wie se aansoeke geweier  is,  kan  dit
nie net geld vir die leiers aan weerskante van die stryd nie. Dit  moet  vir
almal geld. Daarom is die VF ten gunste van 'n algehele amnestie  vir  almal
wat dade met 'n politieke motief gepleeg het tydens die  konflikte  van  die
verlede en wel voor 10 Mei 1994.

Die Regering sal nie hiervan kan wegkom nie. Of daar word algehele  amnestie
gegee, òf almal word vervolg voor die voet,  insluitend  die  37  ANC-leiers
wie se amnestie geweier is en andere. Ons sal die begrotingspos steun,  maar
die antwoord lê in 'n algehele amnestie as ons werklik  'n  nuwe  begin  wil
maak. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In Sunday's Rapport it was reported that  a  discussion  was  taking  place
between the Minister and certain generals regarding  this  problem.  The  FF
supports this initiative, but let there be no doubt: If  we  were  to  start
making exceptions in granting amnesty to people who either did not apply  or
who did apply but whose applications were turned  down,  this  cannot  apply
only to the leaders on  both  sides  of  the  struggle.  It  must  apply  to
everyone. For that reason the FF is in  favour  of  a  general  amnesty  for
everyone who committed deeds with a political motive  during  the  conflicts
of the past, that is prior to 10 May 1994.

The Government will not be able  to  get  away  from  this.  Either  general
amnesty must be granted, or everyone must be prosecuted  without  exception,
including the 37 ANC leaders whose amnesty was turned down, and  others.  We
shall support the Vote, but the answer lies  in  a  general  amnesty  if  we
really want to make a fresh start.]
Mr L T LANDERS: Chairperson, unlike the hon Sheila Camerer, we  in  the  ANC
do not see problems from her doom  and  gloom  perspective,  but  rather  as
challenges which must be met with conviction.

Soon after he took  office,  hon  Minister  Maduna  undertook  a  series  of
surprise visits to various courts, police  stations  and  prisons,  together
with the Ministers of Safety and Security and  Correctional  Services.  Soon
after that, Minister Maduna reported to some of us in the Justice  portfolio
committee about some of his experiences during those visits.

I particularly recall his anecdote about the broken and leaking  water  pipe
he came across at one court building they visited, the  fact  that  everyone
was aware of it, but that nobody seemed to  be  interested  or  keen  to  do
anything about it, and particularly the bureaucracy involved  in  trying  to
have the leaking water  pipe  repaired  through  the  appropriate  channels.
Eventually, hon Minister Maduna, at his own expense,  engaged  the  services
of a local plumber and had this water pipe repaired. I would like to say  to
the hon Camerer to please take note.

In April this year, the Justice  committees  of  Parliament  also  undertook
visits to courts and Master's offices in the four provinces -  Gauteng,  the
Eastern Cape, the Northern Province and KwaZulu-Natal. What hon members  saw
with their own eyes and experienced for themselves  is  cause  for  concern,
particularly with regard to the physical state of court buildings.  It  also
brings into question the relationship between the Department of Justice  and
the Department of Public Works, and, more importantly, the  nonexistence  of
a dedicated maintenance programme for court buildings.

Let me begin with the Durban magistrates' court. As hon members  know,  this
is a relatively large court building. On the day we arrived for  our  visit,
the airconditioning system was  out  of  order.  Indeed,  we  were  reliably
informed  that  it  had  been  that  way   for   the   past   nine   months,
notwithstanding several written requests and appeals to  the  Department  of
Justice and, subsequently, to the Department of Public Works, all  of  which
to no avail.

Moreover, several cases have had to  be  adjourned  on  days  when  Durban's
notorious heat and humidity reached intolerable and  unbearable  levels.  We
note,  also,  that  the  Department  of  Public  Works'  building  programme
provides for a new airconditioning system to be implemented in  December  of
this year. However, the problem that remains is the intervening period.

In Randburg, I am reliably informed  by  my  colleagues  and  comrades,  the
magistrates' court building is described as  falling  apart,  and  that  the
roof of the building is  about  to  collapse  on  court  personnel  and  the
public. It is also important to note that the  Randburg  magistrates'  court
is working from six different buildings and is bursting at the seams,  owing
to a lack of adequate accommodation,  which  has  been  exacerbated  by  the
movement of businesses out of the Johannesburg CBD to areas such as  Sandton
and Randburg.
The lack of a dedicated maintenance programme for  court  buildings  assumes
added significance when one  considers  a  report  from  the  Department  of
Public Works dated 1995, which states and I quote:


  The question of inadequate funds for the  proper  maintenance  of  public
  buildings is aggravated by the fact that the Department of Public Works's
  property portfolio is increasing every year, with  the  addition  of  new
  buildings either erected or purchased.

If one considers the number of new court buildings that  have  already  been
erected since that 1995 report,  and  the  number  of  new  court  buildings
scheduled for completion in the near future, one can understand the  problem
facing us.  Unless  and  until  the  question  of  a  dedicated  maintenance
programme for our court buildings is seriously and urgently addressed  as  a
matter of policy, not only will this problem not go away, it will  get  even
worse.

One aspect of the courts' infrastructure, which  is  the  responsibility  of
the  Department  of  Justice,  and   which   requires   long   and   careful
consideration, is the provision of security  at  all  our  court  buildings.
Security at  our  courts  should  not  be  a  once-off  event  that  occurs,
particularly when a notorious gang leader or drug lord  is  due  to  appear.
Security at our court buildings should be the norm.

Another very important aspect of  the  Justice  committee's  visits  to  the
provinces was to the offices of  the  Master  of  the  High  Court.  At  the
entrance to the Master's office in Pietermaritzburg, one is greeted  by  row
after row of box files on the floor, standing at  attention  like  regiments
of soldiers. The reasons these box files occupy  every  available  piece  of
floor space is because the Master's office has not been provided  with  even
the most rudimentary shelving.

It is said that every person will pass through the Master's office at  least
once in their life. The  Master's  office,  which  is  the  oldest  judicial
institution in the country, is the statutory office  charged  with  settling
the affairs and interests of those who have died. The Master's  office  also
acts as the guardian of minors' interests. It must also be  noted  that  our
highly acclaimed Asset Forfeiture  Unit  relied  heavily  on  the  expertise
provided by the Master's office in setting up that unit. Each one  of  those
box  files,  therefore,  represents  an  important  and  integral  part   of
somebody's life. Why then are they not properly housed?

Some years ago some bright spark in the Department of Justice  decided  that
the  office  responsible  for  the  guardians'  fund,  should  be  allocated
computers, and the Pietermaritzburg office  duly  received  four  of  these.
Unfortunately and regrettably, the hardware came without software. With  the
right planning and attention, I firmly believe that the Master's office  can
and should become an island of excellence  in  our  justice  system.  It  is
hoped that the proposed Master's  office  systems  plan  will  help  address
these problems.

We are excited by some of the developments within  the  justice  system.  We
applaud and commend the  successes  achieved  by  the  National  Prosecuting
Authority, the Scorpions, and the Asset Forfeiture Unit. We look forward  to
addressing the challenges that face us. [Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, hon Ministers,  there  have  been  notable
improvements in the Department of Justice since the introduction of  various
programmes to our justice system, though there is much that still has to  be
done to address the apartheid legacy in justice.

We applaud those prosecutors  who  supported  this  initiative  by  availing
themselves to work on Saturdays without any form of  remuneration  when  the
plan was introduced, especially in Mpumalanga  and  other  sections  of  the
country. We know, as a matter of fact, that prior to this  arrangement,  the
wheels of  justice  were  grinding  very  slowly.  What  we  still  have  to
establish is the rate of this success as  measured  against  the  number  of
cases brought before our courts on time. This has serious  implications  for
those who are  awaiting  trial,  as  this  costs  the  states  millions  and
millions.

The basic working conditions of justice officials, particularly  prosecutors
and magistrates, should be improved as they play an important  role  in  the
country's justice system. It is to be hoped that  the  past  scenes  of  our
prosecutors toyi-toying as a result of being poorly paid will be avoided  at
all costs by the department. We also note with relief that the  Minister  of
Justice has no ambition or intention to bring the judiciary under  executive
control, as intimated in the media.

Tekanyetso-kabo ya lefapha le, e tshwanela  ke  go  lepalepana  le  nako  ya
gompieno. Bogodu le tsietso tsa malatsi a, ke tse di ko mankalengkaleng.  Ka
jalo boitsanape jo bo dirisiwang  ke  lefapha  le  jaanong,  botshwanela  go
lepalepana le ona mokgwa o. (Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[The budget of this department has to correspond with  this  period.  Levels
of theft and fraud are very high these days.  The  department's  strategies,
therefore, have to be able to combat these problems in current situation.]

We therefore support the budget as it stands with  the  provision  that  the
department identifies other sources of funding  to  augment  state  sources.
This can be  achieved  in  partnership  with  nongovernmental  organisations
involved in the criminal justice system. [Time expired.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Mr Chairperson, the PAC supports this  Budget  Vote,  but  I
want  to  comment  on  some  parts  of  the  Constitution.  With  monotonous
regularity it is said that South Africa has the  best  constitution  in  the
world. How true is this? Whose standards and values  are  being  applied  in
judging this Constitution? Whose political, economic and cultural  interests
is this Constitution protecting?

Let me address five issues out of sixteen: Firstly,  in  its  preamble,  the
South African Constitution says that ``the people of South Africa  recognise
the injustices of our past'' and ``honour those  who  suffered  for  justice
and freedom in our land''. But many former  freedom  fighters  such  as  the
Azanian People's Liberation Army and others have been sentenced to  barbaric
prison sentences for their past armed  activities  against  colonialism  and
apartheid. For example, Thapelo Maseko was sentenced to 55  years  inprison,
Bhani Mangalisekile to 58 years, Shakespeare Buthelezi to  64  years,  Ngesi
Silimele to 69 years, Mdudeki Ntantiso to 74 years, Kenny  Motsamai  to  two
life prison sentences plus 19 years,  and  Phakamile  Cishe  to  three  life
prison sentences plus 24 years. In  practice,  this  is  the  way  they  are
``honoured'' for having suffered for justice  and  freedom  in  their  land.
Kwanele Mzisi was sentenced to two life prison sentences  for  his  part  in
the liberation  struggle.  He  died  in  prison  after  being  assaulted  by
hardened criminals with whom he was lumped.

Secondly, sections 232 and  233  of  the  Constitution  claim  to  recognise
principles of international law, but the  International  Convention  on  the
Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid has been  ignored  with
impunity  in  this  country.  While  the   former   freedom   fighters   are
languishing, or have languished, in the jails of this country  for  opposing
with arms, and while apartheid was declared a crime against humanity by  the
United Nations, the apartheid  criminals  such  as  Craig  Williamson,  Dirk
Coetzee and scores of other apartheid criminals are as  free  as  air.  They
are  living  comfortable  lives,  while  our  attention,  concerning  crimes
against humanity, is diverted to Yugoslavia and Burundi. The TRC itself  has
ignored the principles that were applied at the international Nuremberg  and
Tokyo tribunals.  It  has  committed  unprecedented  injustice  against  the
victims of the crime against humanity in this country.

Thirdly, section 25(7) of the Constitution declares  that  people  who  were
dispossessed of land can claim only from June 1913. This is  illogical,  and
it is a mutilation of the history of land  dispossession  in  this  country.
Lest posterity be misled, the truth is that the  African  majority  of  this
country was allocated 7% of the total land area of this country through  the
Native Land Act of 1913. Another 6%  crumb  was  added  through  the  Native
Trust Land Act of 1936. That is why today there  is  this  massive  poverty,
homelessness, disease and ignorance among the African people, and  they  are
the only people who  live  in  filthy  mekhukhus  [shacks]  throughout  this
country and suffer high child mortality and the shortest life expectancy.

Land dispossession goes back to shortly after Jan van Riebeeck arrived  here
on 6 April 1652. Section 25(7) is  a  perpetuation  of  land  dispossession.
Unless it is amended, all  talk  of  land  reform  will  remain  a  colossal
political fraud, and the African majority of this country will  continue  to
be perpetual  beggars,  owning  nothing  but  amatyotyombe  [God  bless  the
nation] and a bastardised ``Nkosi Sikelela - Morena  Boloka  Sechaba''  [God
bless the nation.]

Fourthly, this  Constitution  has  a  clear  stamp  of  eurocentricity  gone
eccentric  and  egocentric.  It  gives  rights  to   homosexuals   in   very
unambiguous language. But not so  to  African  royalty,  called  traditional
leaders in this country.
Fifthly, section 12(1)(c) states that ``everyone has the right  to  security
of the person ... free from all forms  of  violence  from  both  public  and
private sources ...'' But, is murder and rape not the order of  the  day  in
this country? It is disturbing that this past week it took the theft of  the
car of the President's mother and  the  stoning  of  her  house  to  attract
police protection. Is it not strange that the mother  of  the  President  is
not protected when it is clear that she could be the target of all sorts  of
criminals?

A good constitution is like clothes. It should be made to fit the people  it
is meant to serve. A  constitution  which  is  short  on  implementation  or
impractical is meaningless and must be amended. [Applause.]

Mr M T MASUTHA: Mr Chairperson, hon members of the House, let me  start  off
by  quoting  from  the  very  opening  statement  in  our  Constitution,  as
contained in the preamble, upon which my contribution to this  debate  today
is largely based:


  We, the people of South Africa,
  Recognise the injustices of our past;
  Honour those who suffered for justice and freedom in our land;
  Respect those who have worked to build and develop our country; and
  Believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it,  united  in  our
  diversity.

[Interjections.] The hon member should shut up and listen!

It is in this spirit  that  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  was
established under the interim Constitution,  and  continued  under  the  new
Constitution,  and  in  terms  of  the  Promotion  of  National  Unity   and
Reconciliation Act of 1995, to  exercise  its  mandate  to  investigate  and
establish as complete a picture  as  possible  of  the  nature,  causes  and
extent of gross human rights violations, which form a critical part  of  our
unenviable past, so as to achieve true reconciliation amongst our people.

In presenting its report before the portfolio committee last week,  the  TRC
summarised its work since October 1998 to  date  -  which,  I  may  add,  is
characterised by some very remarkable achievements and  a  marvellous  track
record - and presented a fairly small budget of  about  R10  million  needed
for the winding up of its business by around September this year.

Let me now turn to  the  institutions  supporting  constitutional  democracy
established under Chapter 9 of the Constitution. These institutions  include
the Public Protector, the Human Rights Commission  and  the  Commission  for
Gender  Equality.  According  to  section  181(2),  these  institutions  are
independent and subject only to the Constitution and the law, and they  must
be impartial and exercise their powers and perform their  functions  without
fear, favour  or  prejudice.  However,  subsection  (5)  states  that  these
institutions are accountable to this House, and must report at least once  a
year to this  House  on  their  activities  and  the  performance  of  their
functions.  Subsection  (3)  obliges  other   organs   of   state,   through
legislative and other measures, to assist  and  protect  these  institutions
and to ensure their independence, impartiality, dignity and effectiveness.

The Public Protector, in presenting his budget to  the  portfolio  committee
last week, expressed concern regarding the  attitude  of  certain  political
parties represented in this  House,  who  utter  statements  in  the  media,
calculated  to  undermine  the  integrity  of   that   institution   without
restraint,  and  thereby  undermining  the  very  core  of  our   democratic
dispensation. These culprits are, of course, well known to all of us and  to
themselves for their unenviable track record  under  their  ``Slaan  Terug''
policy, which is aimed at pulling  this  country  two  steps  backwards  for
every step forward.  We  all  know  about  the  vicious  attacks  they  have
levelled against the  Human  Rights  Commission  before,  and  their  biased
approach to race relations; of  being  vocal  only  when  white  people  are
affected, and keeping a deafening silence when it is black  people  who  are
the victims of racial prejudice.

On this note, let me  congratulate  the  Human  Rights  Commission  for  its
monumental work in fighting the various ``isms'' - racism  being  the  worst
amongst them - which sadly continue to characterise  the  social  fabric  of
our society and, like a virus, mutates every time a new cure  is  found  for
it. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr M T  MASUTHA:   Turning  to  the  right  of  access  to  justice,  it  is
encouraging to note that the department and the Legal Aid Board have  opened
10 justice centres and plan to have launched a total of 60  by  2004.  These
centres will bring the judicial system closer to the  people.  Most  of  our
legal services are located far from where our  communities  live.  They  are
also often inaccessible physically, financially and otherwise. It  is  hoped
that these centres will help to end this legacy.

Disabled People South Africa, DPSA, has linked up with the Legal  Aid  Board
and has pledged its support for the board to ensure that these  centres  are
truly accessible to all people, disabled  people  included.  The  board  has
made progress  in  making  the  justice  centres  physically  accessible  to
persons in wheelchairs. I commend the progress made so far. However,  it  is
also critical to make the centres accessible to blind  persons  through  the
usage of Braille facilities, to deaf persons through the provision  of  sign
language interpreters, and to persons with mental disabilities  through  the
usage of intermediaries to  facilitate  better  communication  during  court
proceedings. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek wil my bydrae tot hierdie debat  vandag
begin met 'n ware verhaal. Kom ons noem dit ``'n Dag  in  die  Lewe  van  'n
Plattelandse Hof in Suid-Afrika''.

'n Vriend van my se bejaarde vader se swart werknemer word wederregtelik  en
met duistere motiewe aangekla van die diefstal van twee T-hemde, en word  in
hegtenis geneem. Die vriend probeer om vir hom 'n prokureur te  kry  om  die
saak pro Deo vir hom te hanteer. Die prokureur sien egter nie  kans  om  die
saak ordentlik te hanteer vir die R75 wat hy daarvoor  by  die  Regshulpraad
sal kry nie.

My vriend, 'n student in die regte, besluit om self  die  saak  te  hanteer.
Die saak kom voor 'n maand en een week nadat  die  beskuldigde  in  hegtenis
geneem is vir die diefstal van twee T-hemde. Die landdros  arriveer  'n  uur
laat. Die saak word binne drie minute afgehandel en uit die hof gegooi.

Tien sake word in die volgende uur in die hof gehanteer. Die  staatsaanklaer
is onbevoeg en het belangrike lêers nie saamgebring nie, en nie een van  die
10 sake word afgehandel nie. My vriend werk uit dat net die uitstel van  die
sake in daardie uur vir die 10 beskuldigdes saam meer as agt  maande  beloop
-  agt  maande  in  ons  reeds   oorvol   tronke,   agt   maande   wat   die
belastingbetaler ten duurste kos, agt maande om  bloot  by  die  proses  van
regspraak uit te kom.

Suid-Afrika sit met  'n  gevangenisbevolking  van  160 000,  bykans  dubbeld
oorbevolk. Meer as 60 000 van hulle is verhoorafwagtend.  Wat  'n  refleksie
op die Departement van Justisie! 'n Ander prokureursvriend deel my  mee  dat
uitsteltydperke in 'n gewone landdroshof tans gemiddeld vier tot vyf  maande
is vanweë die oorvol hofrolle. Dit is vyf maande as verhoorafwagtende in  'n
gevangenis. Vroeër was dit minder as 'n maand. Dit  is  in  koue  feite  die
getuigskrif vir ons strafregstelsel. (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, I  want  to  begin  my  contribution  to  this
debate today with a true story. Let us call it ``A Day  in  the  Life  of  a
Rural Court in South Africa''.

A black employee of the aged father of a friend of mine  is  wrongfully  and
inexplicably accused of the theft of two  T-shirts,  and  is  arrested.  The
friend attempts to get him a lawyer to handle the  case  pro  Deo.  However,
the lawyer does not see his way clear to handle the case  properly  for  the
R75 he will receive for it from the Legal Aid Board.

My friend, a law student, decides to handle the case himself.  The  case  is
heard a month and a week after the accused was arrested  for  the  theft  of
two T-shirts. The magistrate arrives an hour late. The case  is  dealt  with
within three minutes and thrown out of court.

In the hour that follows ten cases  are  heard  in  the  court.  The  public
prosecutor is incompetent and has not brought important files to court,  and
not one of the ten cases is finalised. My friend calculates  that  just  the
postponement of the cases in this hour together amounts to more  than  eight
months - eight months  for  the  ten  accused  in  our  already  overcrowded
prisons, eight months which cost the taxpayer dearly,  eight  months  merely
to get to the process of the administration of justice.

South Africa has a prison  population  of  160  000,  virtually  double  the
prison capacity. More than 60 000  of  them  are  awaiting-trial  prisoners.
What a reflection on the Department of Justice! Another attorney  friend  of
mine has told me that  postponement  periods  in  the  average  magistrates'
court are currently on average four to five months  as  a  result  of  court
rolls being too full. That is five months as an awaiting-trial  prisoner  in
a prison. Previously it was less than a month. In cold  facts  this  is  the
testimonial of our criminal justice system.]

We were promised, two years ago, that the department would rid the  criminal
justice system of major bottlenecks. None of these have materialised.  As  a
result, there are ever-increasing court rolls and overcrowded prisons.

Die AEB onderstreep sekere aanbevelings  deur  van  die  ander  sprekers  in
hierdie debat, veral 'n verhoogde justisiebegroting  met  beter  geriewe  en
salarisse vir aanklaers en ander personeel. Hierdie addisionele  fondse  sal
dubbel  en   dwars   teruggewen   word   deur   kleiner   hofrolle,   minder
verhoorafwagtendes in die tronke en die inperking van  misdaad  wat  daaruit
sal volg.

Hierbenewens wil die AEB  twee  onkonvensionele  aanbevelings  doen  om  die
situasie die hoof te bied. Die eerste een is soos volg. In siviele  reg  het
ons die Hof vir Klein  Eise,  met  'n  sterk  beperkte  jurisdiksie,  sonder
regsverteenwoordiging en met  'n  gesiene  advokaat  of  prokureur  uit  die
plaaslike gemeenskap in die  stoel.  Is  daar  nie  'n  moontlikheid  om  'n
soortgelyke meganisme vir kriminele sake van kleiner orde in  te  stel  nie?
Veral  vir  kleiner  oortredings  met  'n  beperkte  strafbevoegdheid,   met
natuurlik die reg tot appèl, kan dit goed werk.  'n  Tweede  aanbeveling  is
dat ons die latjies moet terugbring! (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[The AEB would like  to  underline  certain  recommendations  by  the  other
speakers in this debate,  particularly  an  increased  justice  budget  with
better facilities and  salaries  for  prosecutors  and  other  staff.  These
additional funds will be fully  recovered  by  shorter  court  rolls,  fewer
awaiting-trial prisoners in the prisons and the  restriction  of  the  crime
which occurs as a result.

In  addition  to  this  the  AEB  would  like  to  make  two  unconventional
recommendations to deal with the situation. The  first  is  as  follows.  In
civil  law  we  have  the  Small  Claims  Court,  with  a  severely  limited
jurisdiction, without legal representation and with a respected advocate  or
attorney from the local community in the chair.  Does  the  possibility  not
exist to implement a similar mechanism  for  less  serious  criminal  cases?
This can work  well,  particularly  for  smaller  offences  with  a  limited
punitive  jurisdiction,  naturally  with  the  right  to  appeal.  A  second
recommendation is that we should bring back the cane!]

Corporal punishment for the less serious  crimes  should  be  brought  back,
especially to deal with young and first offenders.  The  population  in  our
prisons can be drastically reduced and the court rolls will be shortened.

Yes, I know the outcry about human rights violations. But, is it not a  case
of the utmost hypocrisy when one prefers to throw a culprit in jail  knowing
that it is, in many cases, a deferred death penalty  because  he  is  almost
certain to be be raped very soon and could easily become infected with  HIV?
[Interjections.]

Laat ons  jong,  eerste,  ligte  oortreders  eerder  goed  ``gadeslaan''  en
terugplaas in die gemeenskap, en ek waarborg agb lede, baie  van  hulle  sal
eerste oortreders bly om sodoende nie in die tronke in geharde kriminele  te
ontaard nie.

Ander sake wat die aandag verdien, is onder meer die  uitspraak  van  regter
Southwood oor die onafhanklikheid van die howe. Ek herhaal  die  beroep  wat
ek by wyse van 'n voorstel op die Minister gedoen het om  hierdie  uitspraak
te eerbiedig en dringend daarvan werk te maak. Ons mag nie toelaat  dat  die
ongelukkige debat oor die skeiding van magte tussen die  wetgewende  en  die
uitvoerende  gesag  ook  die  onafhanklikheid  van  die  regsprekende  gesag
kontamineer nie.

Ook moet die AEB die Minister daaraan herinner dat dit die  derde  geval  is
waar  hy  die  wind  van  voor  kry  weens  onregmatige  inmenging  in   die
regsproses. Hy moet fokus op sy  primêre  taak,  naamlik  die  skep  van  'n
infrastruktuur en ordelike raamwerk vir regspleging deur die regslui self.

In dié verband wil die AEB  weer  eens  sy  standpunt  onderstreep  dat  die
aanstelling van landdroste in die gelykheidshowe  deur  die  Minister  nooit
die toets van grondwetlikheid sal slaag nie. Ons vra dat dit  ook  gehanteer
word in ooreenstemming met regter Southwood se uitspraak.

Ek wil  ook  verwys  na  die  uitspraak  van  die  Konstitusionele  Hof  dat
halsmisdadigers nie uitgelewer kan word aan lande waar  die  doodstraf  geld
nie. Die gevaar bestaan dat Suid-Afrika kan ontaard in 'n  moordenaarspelonk
vir die wêreld se gehardste kriminele, en dat moordenaars en verkragters  na
Suid-Afrika kan kom en sê  soos  ons  in  die  bekende  wegkruiperspeletjie:
``Een-twee-drie, blok myself!'' Spesiale en dringende maatreëls  sal  getref
moet word om sodanige voortvlugtiges te keer voor hulle in Suid-Afrika  voet
aan wal kan sit.

Die WVK sluit sy  werksaamhede  af.  Nou  staar  vervolging  mense  wat  nie
amnestie gekry of gevra het nie in die gesig.  Vervolgings  kan  nou  begin.
Die AEB steun die gesprekke tussen die generaals en die  Regering.  Dit  lyk
of 'n soort uitruiltransaksie kan plaasvind, anders moet  byvoorbeeld  beide
mnr Mbeki en genl Constand Viljoen vervolg word.

Dit is in orde, maar amnestie mag nie bloot  elitisties  gehanteer  word  en
aan die top echelons verleen word terwyl die voetsoldate wat hulle  opdragte
by die top echelons gekry het die spit moet afbyt nie. Die  AEB  herbevestig
sy herhaalde pleidooi om algemene amnestie aan  almal  wat  misdade  met  'n
politieke motief gepleeg het. Niks anders sal die boeke van die verlede  kan
toemaak nie.

Hierdie departement is ook belas met grondwetlike ontwikkeling. Daarvan  het
nog niks tereg gekom nie. Die blote bestaan van so 'n portefeulje  sê  reeds
vir ons die Grondwet mag nooit staties wees nie en is nie  in  beton  gegiet
nie. Vir 'n land met 'n  homogene  bevolking  sou  'n  liberaal-demokratiese
grondwet voldoende kon wees. Die huidige Grondwet  verdiskonteer  egter  nie
die plurale verskeidenheid  van  die  Suid-Afrikaanse  bevolking  genoegsaam
nie. Die AEB doen 'n dringende beroep op die departement om sy naam  gestand
te doen  en  aandag  te  skenk  aan  hierdie  grondwetlike  wysigings.  [Tyd
verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Let us rather give young, first, minor offenders our  close  attention  and
place them back in the community, and I guarantee hon members, many of  them
will remain first offenders so that they  will  not  develop  into  hardened
criminals in prison.

Other matters which deserve attention include the statement  by  Mr  Justice
Judge Southwood about the independence of the courts. I repeat the appeal  I
made to the Minister by way of a motion to honour this statement and  attend
to it urgently. We must not allow the unfortunate debate on the division  of
powers between the legislature and the executive  also  to  contaminate  the
independence of the judiciary authority.

The AEB must also remind the Minister that this is  the  third  occasion  on
which  he  is  experiencing  opposition  as   a   result   of   illegitimate
interference in the legal process.  He  must  focus  on  his  primary  task,
namely the creation of an  infrastructure  and  orderly  framework  for  the
administration of justice by the legal practitioners themselves.

In this regard the AEB would like once again to underline its position  that
the appointment of magistrates in the equity courts  by  the  Minister  will
never pass the test of constitutionality. We ask that  this  also  be  dealt
with in accordance with the statement by Mr Justice Southwood.

I also want to  refer  to  the  ruling  by  the  Constitutional  Court  that
perpetrators of capital crimes may not be extradited to countries where  the
death penalty is in operation. The  danger  exists  that  South  Africa  can
develop  into  a  refuge  for  murderers,  for  the  world's  most  hardened
criminals, and that murderers and rapists can come to South Africa and  say,
as we  do  in  the  well-known  hide-and-seek-game:  ``One-two-three,  block
myself!'' Special and urgent measures will have to be  taken  to  stop  such
fugitives before they can arrive in South Africa.

The TRC is concluding its activities. People who did not receive or ask  for
amnesty now face prosecution. Prosecutions can now begin. The  AEB  supports
the discussions between the generals and the Government. It appears  that  a
type of exchange transaction could take place, otherwise both Mr  Mbeki  and
Gen Constand Viljoen, for example, must be prosecuted.

This is in order, but amnesty must not be handled in an elitist  manner  and
only be granted to the top echelons, while the foot  soldiers  who  received
their orders from  the  top  echelons  have  to  bear  the  brunt.  The  AEB
reconfirms  its  repeated  appeal  for  general  amnesty  to  everyone   who
committed crimes with a political motive. Nothing less can close  the  books
of the past.

This department is also tasked with constitutional development. Nothing  has
yet come of that. The mere existence of such a portfolio  already  tells  us
that the Constitution may never remain static and is not cast in stone.  For
a country with a homogenous population  a  liberal  democratic  constitution
would possibly be sufficient. However, the  current  Constitution  does  not
adequately take the diversity of the South African population into  account.
The AEB makes an urgent appeal to the department to live up to its name  and
give attention to these constitutional amendments. [Time expired.]]

Mr G SOLOMON: Chairperson, there  is  a  very  simple  fact  that  is  often
overlooked in South Africa in that today South Africa  consists  of  40  583
574 people and not a privileged few as  before.  The  Constitution  of  this
country demands that each one of them, men,  women  and  children,  wherever
and however they live, must have a right and access to justice defined  very
simple as: All shall be equal before the law. And, it is simply  interpreted
as follows: No one shall  be  imprisoned,  deported  or  restricted  without
trial and no  one  shall  be  condemned  by  the  order  of  any  government
official. The courts shall be representative  of  the  people.  Imprisonment
shall only be for serious crimes against the people and  shall  aim  at  re-
educating and not vengeance. All laws which discriminate on the  grounds  of
race, colour, gender or belief shall be repealed.

This very simple but profound and constitutionally correct formulation of  a
justice vision was not done by any legal expert in  our  department  but  by
the millions of ordinary and oppressed South  Africans,  ``for  all  in  our
country and the world to know'', at the Congress of the People  in  Kliptown
on 26 June 1955.

It was proclaimed at the time when the  role  of  the  legal  administrative
apparatus was not there to protect and enforce the rights of people, but  to
serve as the crucial instrument  of  control  and  domination,  and  served,
simultaneously, the needs of an apartheid economy and the national  security
to  protect  the  lifestyle  and  privileges  of  a  small  section  of  the
population. Today we are 40,5  million.  It  was  the  most  vivid  form  of
domination in the world, exercised with the law and enforced by the courts.

The problems in the department are serious  and  are  being  physically  and
scientifically identified, by the  director-general  and  a  very  competent
Chief Financial Officer, seconded by Business  Against  Crime,  as  ones  of
management and financial control. Many of these problems  were  verified  on
our trips, multiparty visits to the  various  provinces,  and  many  of  the
speakers here have mentioned them.

However, besides these main flaws mentioned here by  many,  there  are  many
more. In our meetings  with  the  department  I  was  deeply  impressed  and
encouraged by the upfrontness and openness  of  Director-General,  Adv  Vusi
Pikoli, about the serious situation in the department, and I wish to say  to
Adv Pikoli that  this  attitude  is  certainly  the  first  step  towards  a
solution.

At the opening of the new civil courts in Cape Town  recently  the  hon  the
Minister made a very profound statement to the effect that  a  credible  and
legitimate justice system is the cornerstone of our Government and the  type
of society that we envisage. We agree entirely with  him.  But  we  need  to
convince the Minister of Finance that providing an effective, efficient  and
successfully  administered  justice  system  will  contribute  towards   the
following - and I am sure the businesspersons will appreciate  this:  better
social  cohesion,  enhanced  community  security  and  an  environment   for
economic growth. If the laws  are  upheld  and  business  can  be  conducted
freely, fairly and safely, it  creates  confidence,  encouraging  enterprise
and investment.

So what are we doing about the serious challenges facing the  administration
of justice in our country?  In  a  series  of  serious  portfolio  committee
meetings with the department and other structures, and tough, hard, nose-to-
nose talks the department outlined in minute detail how they were  going  to
manage the approximately R3 billion allocated  for  the  year  2000-2001  in
order, as we might say, to turn the benches around  in  the  ailing  justice
system.

The department adopted a revolutionary strategic direction  by  establishing
10 business units  with  detailed  plans  for  the  implementation  of  core
functions of each aspect of the department for the  next  four  years.  This
strategic plan is informed by the following: Firstly, the shock of  the  bad
performance of the previous  financial  years,  including  the  unauthorised
expenditure;  secondly,  the  attitude  of  some   judicial   officers   who
misrepresent  the  new  constitutional  order   and   thereby   impede   the
transformation process; thirdly, the  new  constitutional  dispensation  and
the substantial increase in the number of laws passed by Parliament, with  a
concomitant increase in the volume of work performed  by  our  courts;  and,
lastly, the introduction of equality - this has been mentioned before, so  I
will not worry about that.

The crux of the mission of the strategic business plan  is  to  ensure  that
budget planning and allocation correspond with the actual needs, to  perform
the core functions of the justice system and ensure that  values  are  added
in return for the funds allocated by the proper  utilisation  of  resources,
efficiency and productivity. This revolutionary plan is the hope and  saving
grace of the justice system, because it is scientific.

However, it  needs  the  co-operation  of  a  number  of  role-players  with
differing interests and, I think, here  is  the  problem.  Synergy  must  be
established  among  the  Minister,  the  judiciary,  the   National   Public
Prosecuting Authority, the South African Police Service, the  Department  of
Correctional Services, the Department of Social Development,  the  portfolio
committee and many others.

There is no reason  whatsoever  that  this  cannot  be  effected  under  the
principle of Chapter 3 of our Constitution,  which  enjoins  all  organs  of
state to observe the principle of good governance. If this is  going  to  be
misrepresented as compromising  the  independence  of  any  of  these  role-
players, particularly the judiciary, which  is  crucial  to  this  strategic
plan, we are going to run into serious problems.

I believe that no organ of state is  so  sacrosanct  that  the  people  must
suffer on its behalf. We are upbeat and excited  about  the  strategic  plan
and we shall support it to the hilt.
[Applause.]

Mr J H JEFFERY: Mr Chairperson, I heard  yesterday  that  Martin  Welz,  the
editor of noseweek, had withdrawn as inaccurate and incorrect the  statement
making allegations against the Public  Protector,  the  Director  of  Public
Prosecutions, Mr Justice Fikile Bam and our own Chief Whip of  the  Majority
Party.

I listened with interest to the representative of the PAC  in  this  debate,
Dr Pheko, expecting that he would withdraw his party's  allegations  against
those people, particularly as two of those people, the  Director  of  Public
Prosecutions and the Public Protector, form  the  subject  of  this  debate.
Unfortunately, that did not happen. But I hope that will  come  because  the
PAC allegations were based on the noseweek article.

I rise at the tail end of a long debate. Many issues have  been  raised  and
canvassed in the course of this afternoon  regarding  the  workings  of  the
Department of Justice and Constitutional Development. The problems faced  by
the department have not arisen in the  past  financial  year,  neither  will
they be eradicated in the coming one. It is a fundamental legacy,  inherited
from the old regime, the  regime  of  former  Minister  Delport  and  former
Deputy Minister Sheila Camerer.

Talking about former Deputy Minister Sheila Camerer, I find it  ironic  that
one of  the  issues  she  likes  speaking  about  a  lot  is  the  issue  of
reparations for the victims of human rights violations. As  Mrs  Camerer  is
well aware, the vast majority of these human rights abuses  were  caused  by
agents of the NP government. [Interjections.] Maybe it  is  the  hon  former
Deputy Minister's guilty conscience that makes her  so  ardent  in  speaking
out about this issue.

What has been achieved by  the  department  is  the  transformation  of  the
justice system from an organ of injustice  and  oppression,  an  institution
which served the privileged white minority, to  one  that  is  beginning  to
serve the needs of all  the  people  of  South  Africa.  The  crime  against
humanity, ie apartheid, was a system that was upheld through law.  The  pass
laws,  the  Group  Areas  Act,  land  dispossession  laws,  prohibitions  on
expression and association,  were  done  in  terms  of  the  law.  Even  the
sweeping powers given to the State President under the  state  of  emergency
were powers in terms of the law. The repeal of these laws, the  building  of
a human rights  jurisprudence  and  the  transformation  of  the  judiciary,
achieved without sacking any  old  order  judge  or  magistrate,  have  been
remarkable.

Apartheid  has  been  described   as   follows:   that   it   systematically
discriminated against black people in all  aspects  of  social  life.  Black
people were prevented from becoming owners of property or even  residing  in
areas classified as white, which constituted nearly 90% of the land mass  of
South  Africa.  Senior  jobs  and  access   to   established   schools   and
universities were denied to them.  Civic  communities,  including  transport
systems, public parks,  libraries  and  many  shops  were  closed  to  black
people. Instead separate and inferior facilities were provided.

The deep scars  of  this  appalling  programme  are  still  visible  in  our
society. For the benefit  of  the  hon  members  of  the  DP,  that  is  the
description of the Constitutional Court in the judgment concerning  Brink  v
Kitshoff. So the fundamental legacy that we face is that of inequality.

In his state of the nation address last year, the  President  announced  the
holding of a  national  conference  on  racism,  in  the  belief  that  this
initiative would help the country move faster towards realising the goal  of
creating a nonracial society. That conference took  place  last  year  under
the auspices of the Human Rights Commission.

On 20 March this year we debated the call to declare this decade the  decade
against racism. We did so by a majority vote, the DP, New NP,  UDM  and  AEB
dissenting. Later this year we are going to be hosting in South  Africa  the
third international conference against racism. We  need  to  be  looking  at
what we are doing as our contribution in that regard. We  are  seen  by  the
world as the miracle, but how have we built on that miracle since then?

Further points in the programmes of action  were  the  promulgation  of  the
Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, that  the
criminal justice system should be equipped to enforce provisions to  prevent
and punish racist offences, and that officials  in  the  justice  system  be
trained in race sensitivity and race awareness. [Interjections.]

The Constitutional  Court  has  stated  that  it  is  insufficient  for  the
Constitution merely  to  ensure,  through  its  Bill  of  Rights,  that  the
statutory provisions, which have caused such unfair  discrimination  in  the
past, are eliminated. They  go  on  to  say  that,  like  justice,  equality
delayed is equality denied. What is of concern is the slow progress  in  the
implementation of this Act. [Time Expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson,  I  am
rising essentially to thank hon members for what,  I  believe,  was  a  very
good debate on this Vote. I want, particularly, to  single  out  Dr  Delport
for what I think was a very positive contribution. I can assure  Dr  Delport
that the many observations and positive statements that he  made  are  going
to receive serious attention. We will want to engage him, as  I  surely  did
last week, on some of the issues that  he  raised  with  me.  I  thank  him,
indeed, for his positive spirit. [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Like all DP members. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER: Chairperson, then,  of  course,  came  my  old  friend  Sheila
Camerer. [Interjections.] I would like to say to her that it was  as  though
she was not speaking for the DA,  which,  they  all  agree,  they  now  are.
[Interjections.]

Dr Tertius Delport says things that are very important, positive,  etc.  But
then she came and spoilt practically everything that he  had  said.  If  one
were to descend from Mars as she was speaking,  one  would,  indeed,  wonder
whether the hon member was living in this country and, may  I  say,  leading
in this country in the heyday of the apartheid system.  [Interjections.]  It
is no use for her to pretend  that  everything  before  the  demise  of  the
system of apartheid was hunky-dory. It is no use. That is a lie, which  none
of us must actually continue to perpetuate. The infrastructure that  we  are
talking about was not at its best prior to 1994.

Mrs S M CAMERER: It certainly got worse.

The MINISTER: I say to her that it was not at its best. Black people in  the
rural  areas  were  not   walking   short   distances   to   courts,   whose
infrastructure  disappeared  when  the  Bantu  came   into   the   equation.
[Interjections.] This, indeed, was not the  case.  If  she  is  honest,  she
would recognise that we have built more courts than ever existed  under  the
NP. We have done this. Whereas,  in  fact,  when  we  came  into  office  we
discovered 800 magistrates and 600 prosecutors who had  no  formal  training
whatsoever. We are training them.  [Interjections.]  These  are  the  fellow
human beings - the warm bodies - that we inherited from our  past,  who  are
now being trained so that they can perform the tasks that they are  expected
to perform, after having been duly  appointed  to  act  as  magistrates  and
prosecutors.

It is no use to pretend that they emerged only  when  the  Bantu  came  into
office. It is old colonial  balderdash  that  as  long  as  Europe  governed
Africa, everything was hunky-dory. Then, of course, the colonizer ...

Mr D H M GIBSON: What does hunky-dory mean?

The MINISTER: Well, it means exactly what it means, hon member. [Laughter.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: What does it probably mean?

The MINISTER: Well, maybe it is  language  that  the  hon  member  does  not
speak. [Interjections.]

Honestly, it is an old erstwhile colonial position, namely that:  ``As  long
as  we  prevented  them  from  participating  in  the  exercise  of   power,
everything was fine. Then, of  course,  we  made  the  cardinal  mistake  as
colonisers and extended the vote to them, as a result of  which  they  voted
us out of power, and look at what has happened.'' I would  like  to  say  to
Madam Sheila that they have said this before.  They  have.  [Interjections.]
But, Madam Sheila must remember that there has always been the flip side  of
Madam, and that is Eve. [Laughter.]

Now, it is useful to look reality in the face. The  infrastructure  that  we
are grappling with  now  could  have  been  dealt  with  in  the  heyday  of
apartheid. [Interjections.] She could  have  expanded  it  and  could  also,
indeed, have ensured that  it  was  always  better  maintained.  Maintenance
could not be tackled, because they focused on expanding whatever they  raked
in, by way of taxes and loans, on perpetuating the crime of apartheid.  That
is where the money went. The big national debt  today  cannot  be  accounted
for in terms of measurables. What did it do for the majority of the  people?
[Interjections.] It was all wasted. [Applause.]

Now she comes and tells us nothing new. We  have  heard  it  from  erstwhile
colonisers: ``Zambia was the best country  ...''  ``Zimbabwe  was  the  best
country until we packed and left.'' ``Kenya was as good  as  heaven  itself,
etc, until we packed our bags and left.'' She left behind the  reality  that
we are dealing with now. [Interjections.] It was this sort of  reality  that
compelled the former President to say: ``But for God's sake,  can  I  expect
justice from them?'' He was talking about their order.

Mrs  S  M  CAMERER:  Are  you   justifying   the   high   rate   of   crime.
[Interjections.]

The MINISTER: I am not. [Interjections.] I am saying  that  the  hon  member
discovered that there was crime in  this  country  when,  for  instance,  we
stopped, rightly so, the helicopter that was  fluttering  above  whites-only
Sandton,  whites-only  Bryanston,  whites-only  Northcliff,  and  not   over
Soweto, where there was more crime, and  not  over  Nyanga,  Gugulethu,  and
Alexandra. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

This was it when we stopped that, so that the resources could be shared;  so
that  the  resources  could  be   applied   where   crime   was   prevalent.
[Interjections.] The hon member then says there is too much  crime  in  this
country. [Interjections.] Let me tell her that this  is  good  for  her  own
erudition. I think it will help her.

We in the black ghettos always lived with crime, and we had no one to  speak
to about crime, because no one was going to listen  to  us.  [Applause.]  No
one even bothered to consult us. Even those who pretended to speak  here  on
our  behalf,  never  even  bothered  to  consult   us.   They   know   this.
[Interjections.] Let me forget about her now. So much for  her,  please.  It
is a waste of time to talk to her. [Interjections.]

Hon Pheko says that we should address the issue of soldiers  in  jail,  etc.
It is useful to remember that  it  is  this  institution  that  established,
under law, the TRC.  It  is  not  the  executive  that  has  denied  anybody
amnesty. Now, I said the head of state is mindful of  the  fact  that  there
are numerous problems that the TRC process could not resolve.  He  is  aware
of that. That is why we are quietly beginning to  talk  to  people,  on  the
understanding that they are not going to be opportunistic and populistic  in
the way they deal with this sensitive issue. Because it does not  serve  any
useful purpose to pretend that  the  problem  does  not  exist.  Rather,  it
requires leadership, because the people out there are  not  crying  out  for
populism, but for leadership.

The moment is coming when  the  President  presents  for  debate  the  final
report of the TRC. I am hoping that the hon Pheko,  in  particular,  is  not
going  to  be  opportunistic  in  the  way  he  deals  with   that   report.
[Interjections.]

Lastly, the hon member says that the Constitution must be  amended  so  that
we go back to the very first day of the arrival of Van Riebeeck,  99  others
and his wife. [Interjections.] I would like to say to the  hon  member  that
the reasons are well known to all of us. This issue arose at Codesa  itself.
At that point, of course, it is true that the PAC pretended that  it  had  a
special solution for this country, is that not so?  [Interjections.]  Again,
1994 came, and  that  so-called  special  solution  was  rejected  as  utter
nonsense by  the  masses  of  our  people,  who  voted  the  way  they  did.
Hallelujah! [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

The MINISTER: Just a small announcement: Everybody is invited to  the  Marks
Building  after  this.  However,  I   want   to   assure   everybody   that,
notwithstanding the chairperson of the portfolio committee's injunction,  we
shall not insist on  the  production  of  ANC  membership  cards  for  entry
purposes. [Laughter.] [Applause.] All are welcome.

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 18:40.
