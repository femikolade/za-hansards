sitting of the Council:


  That the Council commends the Scorpions for bringing to book a  prominent

  unsophisticated victims of road accidents.

                      CHILD PORNOGRAPHY AND CHILD ABUSE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its deep concern  over  the  latest  allegations  of  child
       pornography;


  (2) notes the raid on the home of a suspected paedophile in  Table  View,
       in which  shocking  photographs  and  videotapes  of  explicit  child
       pornography were confiscated;


  (3) acknowledges the steps that have already been taken by the Government
       to protect the interests of the children in our country;

       is still continuing at an alarming rate;


  (5) commends the South African Police  Service  for  the  arrest  of  the
       alleged perpetrator and our courts for refusing bail; and


  (6) believes that this will  send  out  a  clear  message  to  all  those
       involved in child abuse that their conduct is unacceptable  and  will
       not be tolerated.

       important position in KwaZulu-Natal Cricket, but also  the  officials
       and players of all the clubs for their far-sighted landmark  decision
       which signals to all South Africans  that  at  long  last  merit  has
       become the accepted norm, not only in the selection of teams but also
       in  the  election  of  top  positions  in  the  higher  echelons   of
       Administration in the respective codes of sport.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

[Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the Deputy President, Jacob Zuma, on his appointment as
       the Chancellor of the University of Zululand in Ongoye;


  (2) knows that his appointment to this position  is  the  result  of  the
       trust  the  executive  committee  of  this  University  has  in  him,
       particularly the fact that he can  improve  on  what  it  is  at  the
       moment;

       crisis, buildings need to be fixed and the results  of  students  are
       not satisfactory; and


  (4) hopes greatly that the Deputy  President  will  show  his  talent  in
       solving these problems and uplift the level of  recognition  of  this
       University.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Is  there  any
objection to the motion?

Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, there was no interpretation of the  motion,  so
some of us have no idea what the hon member has moved.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  Is  that
supposed to be an objection?

Mr C  ACKERMANN:  I  do  not  want  to  object  if  it  is  a  good  motion,
Chairperson.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Is  there  any
objection? There is an objection. In the light of the objection, the  motion
may not be proceeded with. The motion without notice will now become  notice
of a motion.

     RACIST PRACTICES BY WHITES AND DEATH OF BLACK MAN IN CARLETONVILLE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with great  dismay  that  some  whites'  propensity  in  racist
       practices,  despite  the  Government's  efforts  to  eradicate   this
       monster, leaves much to be desired;


  (2) notes that the dispute between a black man  and  two  whites  over  a
       parking space in Carletonville on 26 June 2001 ended with  the  death
       of the black man when assaulted by the two whites; and


  (3) is of the view that the law should take its course in this matter and
       that the heaviest punitive measures should be employed to portray the
       gravity of this offence.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

            PROPOSALS TO CATER FOR ANC ARRANGEMENTS IN FREE STATE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) seriously considers instituting a feasibility study into the creation
       of a dedicated shuttle between Bloemfontein and Cape  Town,  so  that
       the ANC can be relieved of the involved mathematical calculations  of
       working out which Free State members have had a turn at being in Cape
       Town, or at being an MEC or not being an MEC; and


  (2) alternatively, requests funds for  a  Free  State  transit  house  at
       Gariepdam, where members can stay over to  work  out  who  should  be
       passing  the  buck  to  whom,  or  whether  to  move  Parliament   to
       Bloemfontein and allocate positions by drawing lots.

[Laughter.]

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Order!   Any
objections? [Laughter.] In the light of objections, the motion  may  not  be
proceeded with. The motion without notice will become notice of a motion.

                     REPORTS OF SEX FOR LIFTS TO SCHOOL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its shock and dismay at girls who give sex for lifts to and
       from school;


  (2) requests the relevant departments to act swiftly against taxi drivers
       and taxi owners who perpetrate such immoral acts in  our  motherland;
       and


  (3) calls upon schools, parents and religious groups to act likewise.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Is  there  any
objection to the motion?

Mr T S SETONA: Chairperson, I want to move as an amendment:


  That, in paragraph (1), after  ``school'',  be  added,  ``as  alleged  in
  newspaper reports''.
We have not made any investigation to verify  the  validity  of  the  report
which appeared in today's papers.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  Rev  Chabaku,
are you agreeable to the proposed amendment?

Rev M CHABAKU: I concur unreservedly, Chairperson. [Interjections.]

Amendment agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Motion, as  amended,  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the
Constitution, namely:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its shock and dismay at girls who give sex for lifts to and
       from school, as alleged in newspaper reports;


  (2) requests the relevant departments to act swiftly against taxi drivers
       and taxi owners who perpetrate such immoral acts in  our  motherland;
       and


  (3) calls upon schools, parents and religious groups to act likewise.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

              (Consideration of Votes of and Schedule to Bill)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  Allow  me  to
take this opportunity to welcome the hon the Minister  and  the  two  Deputy
Ministers to the House.

I have just been informed that a few questions are going to be asked of  the
Ministers and Deputy Ministers, as they  appear  on  the  schedule.  Members
will now  have  the  opportunity  to  ask  responsible  Ministers  questions
regarding their Votes. In as far as  declarations  of  vote  are  concerned,
they will be made during the time when Votes are put, and  I  will  indicate
to members when that time arrives.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, on a point of order: I think  that  hon  members
are disadvantaged by the fact that they do not have the programme  in  front
of them.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  members,
we all knew what we were coming to do. We  are  expected  to  be  ready  and
prepared,  and  to  know   exactly   what   we   actually   want   to   say.
[Interjections.] I know, for instance, that  hon  member  Matthee  indicated
that  he  wanted  to  ask  the  Minister  for  Justice  and   Constitutional
Development a question on Vote No 22. He is free to do so.

Vote No 22 - Justice and Constitutional Development:

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, could  I  just  ask  the  Deputy  Minister  for
Justice and Constitutional  Development  whether  the  shortage  as  far  as
personnel in the department are concerned  is  being  addressed;  and,  more
specifically, whether the  shortage  of  prosecutors  that  we  heard  about
during our deliberations in the committee  with  the  National  Director  of
Public Prosecutions is being addressed in this budget, so that we  can  know
whether these shortages, which apparently were already identified two  years
ago, will now be addressed during the course of this year? Also,  where  are
they provided for in the budget?

The  DEPUTY   MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson, thank you very much for the  question.  It  is  a  little  more
complex than the member indicates. Budget reform has been the  objective  of
our Ministry for the last two years. Indeed, he is quite right, we have  far
too many unfunded posts in both the  magistracy  and  the  prosecution.  The
fact is that the posts are there and they are unfunded.

In March next year, with the appointment of our new  CFO,  we  will  produce
the first zero-based budget in Justice history. We will actually have a  far
greater sense of the core cost of the  budget  for  Justice  and  where  the
money should be spent in terms of prioritisation. In the  National  Assembly
earlier this month, the Minister set, as a target, the filling of  posts  of
judges, magistrates and prosecutors.

There is an added complication. The prosecutor is  under  pressure  because,
in fact, magistrates and prosecutors have the same qualifications, but  they
have different earning levels. What happens is that the attrition  into  the
magistracy from the prosecution  is  huge.  Sometimes  there  are  60  posts
vacated at the end of the month.

With our undertaking with the judges and magistrates at the  colloquium,  we
undertook to review  the  entire  scale  of  judicial  officers  and  people
associated with courts who deliver core service at our points  of  delivery,
and that is where, of course, justice will be judged. It  is  the  intention
of the Minister in the current budget to reprioritise. We will  be  speaking
to the Treasury about moving funds. Obviously,  we  have  scope  within  the
Public Finance Management Act to move, I think it is 8%  from  programme  to
programme, but we might need to make really big adjustments.

The problem is  that  we  have  been  developing  a  management  information
system, and it has taken us a long time. We feel that there is a real  sense
that we are getting somewhere with  budget  reform.  We  have  a  management
information system that will tell us how we  are  spending  our  money,  and
whether it is being spent appropriately and in the places  that  require  it
most. We need to move our money to service delivery and away from  the  huge
administrative structures that we have.

We have the information and the new CEO,  who  has  engendered  an  enormous
amount of confidence with our management, because the  decisions  that  they
are making now are not based on what they think, but in fact  on  what  they
know.

The filling of prosecutors' and magistrates' posts is a priority set by  the
Minister, and we fully intend to do this. We will also be  able  to  provide
Treasury with new information, so that in the future, when they look at  our
budget, they will actually be able to get a much  clearer  picture  of  what
justice does. Also, until our public accounts hearing becomes  the  kind  of
hearing that tells us whether  we  are  spending  our  money  properly,  the
actual management of the money, it will be very  difficult  to  motivate  to
Treasury for more money.

This is a process that has been on for two years and we really have a  sense
that we are getting there. We will have a zero-based  budget,  and  we  will
have managers empowered by information that will make them  able  to  answer
the questions that they will have to answer and deliver in areas where  they
have to deliver.

We are getting a much clearer picture. For instance, we  are  finding  areas
in which we are spending money that could definitely move  away  from  those
areas to the core services of what we do, and  we  will  be  judged  by  the
people who actually interface with us in the courts. We are  confident  that
this will happen.
Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I would like to thank the Deputy  Minister  and
I really appreciate her answer. Would I be  correct  in  saying  that   this
time next year, it will not be necessary for us  to  again  hear  complaints
from the National Director of Public Prosecutions that there is  a  shortage
of prosecutors, and that  is  one  of  their  biggest  problems  as  far  as
addressing the backlog of cases is concerned? Can we assume that  next  year
this time, that problem will have been solved?

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Chairperson, that is an incorrect assumption.  This  is
an incremental process. There are a couple of hundred,  I  am  not  entirely
sure of the figures, but I have seen them recently. The point is that if  we
had to do that kind of movement, it might well compromise something else.

This is an incremental process but it is a priority. We will  do  this  with
an absolute single-mindedness. The Minister has  instructed  the  department
to act and behave accordingly. We  cannot  do  it  in  one  step.  It  would
actually compromise the justice system elsewhere.

There are general shortages, but we also need to look at areas where  courts
are overstaffed. It just needs a mechanical movement of people, but this  is
where our information system is going to provide  us  with  information.  We
are going to get costings on individual court centres and service  provision
points. We are going to have that information and we will be  empowered  for
the first time to make decisions that will assist us in  the  administration
of justice. I can assure the member  that  the  Minister  has  made  this  a
priority, and he will  probably  ask  for  monthly  reports  on  it  at  his
meetings.

Vote No 23 - Safety and Security:

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Deputy  Minister
whether a needs  assessment  was  done  by  the  Department  of  Safety  and
Security on this budget. Furthermore, what is the situation as far  as  this
needs assessment is concerned? In other words, what is the position  as  far
as personnel are concerned? If there is a shortage, what  is  the  shortage?
We all hear  about  staff  shortages  in  the  Police  Service.  What  about
vehicles and other equipment? Are these shortages being  addressed  in  this
budget? Could the Deputy Minister please indicate this information to us?

Furthermore, has this budget been drawn up  with  specific  goals  in  mind?
Could the Minister, as cluster head, indicate what the Department of  Safety
and Security intends doing about the unacceptably high levels of  crime?  Do
we have specific targets linked to  timeframes  and  has  this  budget  been
drawn up with that in mind?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY:  Chairperson,  first  of  all  I
would like to remind the House that not so long ago, in answer  to  the  hon
member, I provided a complete list of shortages in  the  various  categories
in the SAPS. That was tabled in the House because it was very long.  I  hope
that the member remembers this.

First of all I would say that in the last few years - we  thought  it  would
take us seven years - we have been trying to organise the budget in  such  a
way that we move from the situation where 84% of the budget is on  personnel
and only 16% on operational costs. Our objective has been  to  move  to  the
position which we have reached today, where  personnel  constitutes  74%  of
the budget and we have 26% which we can devote to  operational  costs.  This
is the first point I want to make. Generally speaking, we  are  endeavouring
to ensure that the budget is devoted to the actual operational cost  of  the
fight against crime rather than having a lot of the money  paying  personnel
salaries and so forth. We think we are achieving that objective.

I would also say for  example,  that,  we  had  a  very  great  shortage  of
vehicles, especially vehicles which were serviceable. We have been  able  to
bridge the gap so that we now have approximately 35 000  vehicles  where  as
we had 32 000 vehicles  before.  In  this  budget  there  is  provision  for
further purchases of vehicles, not only aimed at  improving  our  fleet  and
the way it is maintained, but also dealing with the vexed  question  of  the
redistribution of resources.

As members are  aware,  when  we  took  over  this  portfolio,  86%  of  the
resources were  devoted  to  protecting  white  areas  and  14%  devoted  to
protecting the rest of the country.

This called for a very big redistribution of  resources  without  -  and  we
must stress this - thereby sacrificing the need to protect every element  of
our society. In other words, we were not going to say: Oh well, let us  move
the resources to other sections of the population, which  would  then  leave
the way open for criminals to attack, which they are  doing,  white  suburbs
and so on. But we had in mind that we must have  a  balanced  approach  with
regard to this question of redistribution.

We discovered for example, that  Umlazi,  which  is  a  huge  township,  had
something like two vehicles, and Kwa-Mashu 58. One  could  not  explain  why
Kwa-Mashu should have 58 vehicles and another township only two or three.
So, as I say, this  requires  that  we  should  redistribute  the  vehicles,
increase the fleet and make sure, which we now can, where the vehicles  are.


Previously we had 32 vehicles, but if someone had asked me where they  were,
because we did not have computers and so on, we were not in  a  position  to
indicate exactly where a particular vehicle was,  who  was  driving  it  and
what it was doing. We are now in a the position to do that.  That  leads  me
straight to the issue of technology. [Time expired.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, can the hon the Minister tell us how  many  new
recruits have been budgeted for in this budget? Just from  hearing  figures,
one thinks of the Western Cape, for instance, where there  is  apparently  a
25% shortage in personnel, and we are looking at a  situation  where  police
and detectives deal with an average of over 500 dockets each,  which  is  an
impossible task. I just want to know what has been budgeted and  whether  we
have a specific number as far as personnel, the  policemen  and  policewomen
are concerned?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson, this gives  me  the
opportunity to remind the House about our detective academy.  We  have  been
able to establish, for the first time in our country, a  detective  academy,
which is run in co-operation  with  the  FBI  of  the  United  States.  This
detective academy is now turning out highly trained detectives.

I do not know if hon members have noticed, when we  have  these  appearances
on TV and so on, that some young, very bright-looking people are in  control
of the crime scenes. These are some of the new detectives  that  are  making
up what was  a  great  shortfall  in  our  country,  in  which  80%  of  our
detectives were untrained. That really is  the  crux  of  the  matter  being
raised by the hon member.

It is obviously absurd to have  a  detective  handling  80  -  actually  the
figure was 80, not 500 files. There is an average of 80 files being  handled
by some detectives. And we reorganised the service.

As hon members know, with regard to the abolition of special  units  and  so
on, and then the emergence of the new detective force and the Scorpions,  we
have now reached a situation where really, it is not what was common talk  a
few years ago. Of course life tends to go much faster than the  perceptions.


I can assure the hon member that actually when  it  comes  to  the  required
personnel, we have made a tremendous amount of progress. Last year we had  1
200 new recruits - that is apart from the detectives - and these are  coming
out now because our courses now are not six months, they are 12 months at  a
time.

I do not think that we have gone over the shortage  of  personnel.  We  have
not. We have about 127 000 police in this country for 40 million  people.  I
know Great Britain has 130 000 for 60 million  people.  But  then  they  are
real police. They are a highly trained police. This is what  we  are  trying
to do: to ensure that the quality of the police is  such  that  we  are  not
relying just on numbers, but on people who are competent.

Vote No 1 - Presidency - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr P A MATTHEE: Mr Chairperson, the discussion of Budget Votes  obliges  the
Executive, led by the President and the Deputy President,  to  give  account
to Parliament. Parliament must pass judgment, not just on what  is  promised
for the future, but on what has actually been achieved. It should  be  noted
that according to a survey released only a few days ago, the  percentage  of
South  Africans  who  are  optimistic   about   the   future   has   dropped
dramatically. Clearly, the Government of the day, because of  its  inability
to deal effectively with the burning issues  of  concern,  such  as  rampant
crime, lack of job creation,  corruption  and  nondelivery,  must  take  the
blame for this.

Die presidensie maak wel vordering ten opsigte van sy operasionele  werking.
Die Parlement sal egter uiters waaksaam moet bly om  toe  te  sien  dat  die
neiging gestuit word om die rol van die uitvoerende gesag ten koste van  dié
van die Parlement oormatig te versterk.

Tydens sy onlangse besoek aan  die  Verenigde  Koninkryk  en  die  Verenigde
State van  Amerika  het  President  Mbeki  Suid-Afrika  se  aansien  in  die
buiteland versterk.

Ongelukkig, ten spyte van ander positiewe  aspekte  van  die  werk  van  die
presidensie, is dit as gevolg van die probleme wat ek uitgelig het  nie  vir
ons moontlik om dié begrotingspos te steun nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[The Presidency is making progress in respect of its  operational  function.
Parliament will, however, have to remain  extremely  vigilant  in  order  to
inhibit a tendency to overamplify the role of  the  executive  authority  at
the expense of that of Parliament.
During his recent visit to the United  Kingdom  and  the  United  States  of
America, President Mbeki fortified South Africa's image abroad.

Unfortunately,  despite  other  positive   aspects   of   the   Presidency's
activities, it is impossible for us  to  support  this  Vote  owing  to  the
problems I have singled out.]

Ms Q D  MAHLANGU:  Mr  Chairperson,  the  ANC  supports  Budget  Vote  No  1
unconditionally because the leadership at  the  top  -  the  President,  the
Deputy President and the Ministry in the Presidency - is a  leadership  with
vision. I think there is no sane  person  in  South  Africa  who  would  not
support and attest to what I am saying.

Under President Mbeki's leadership, the  Cabinet  has  been  clustered  into
different committees in an integrated way, which will  enable  South  Africa
generally and the Cabinet in particular to discuss  and  implement  delivery
programmes in a more integrated way.

The Deputy President recently led  a  delegation  to  Colombia,  Mexico  and
other countries. One of the delegates' main concerns was  to  discuss,  with
their counterparts in those countries, how to  reduce  the  high  levels  of
crime in South Africa, drug trafficking and other matters.

From the responses to questions answered by  the  Deputy  President  in  the
National Assembly, we saw that this visit  had  positive  spin-offs.  It  is
important that we support such initiatives.

The International Investment Council, as announced  by  the  President  last
year in his state-of-the-nation address, has been established. Though it  is
still much too early  to  judge  what  it  has  achieved,  this  is  another
initiative that  shows  that  the  President  is  concerned  about  the  low
investment in the country.

In his state-of-the-nation address this year, the  President  announced  the
establishment of an information technology committee. This is under  way  or
has been established. This is one of the ways, means and measures to  bridge
the digital divide between rich countries and Third World countries.

Under the leadership of  the  Presidency,  the  Millennium  Africa  Recovery
Programme has  been  initiated  in  collaboration  with  the  presidents  of
Nigeria and Algeria. Many countries on the continent have reached  consensus
on the programme and support  it.  This  indicates  that  the  President  is
concerned not only about problems in South Africa or  concerning  ourselves,
but about the continent as a whole.

President Thabo  Mbeki  also  initiated  the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural
Development Strategy and the Urban Renewal Strategy. Towns  like  Alexandra,
KwaMashu, Mdantsane, Botshabelo and Katlehong benefit from this.

The ANC supports this Budget Vote. [Time expired.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Is that  an  objection
from the IFP?

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, it is not an objection, it is a declaration.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  A  declaration  of
vote?

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Yes, Chairperson. The IFP supports the  Budget  Vote,  but
we must declare something.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  There  was  no
indication that the IFP would want to make a declaration  of  vote,  but  we
can allow you to do that.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I did give notice.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): It was  not  indicated
to me, but you can do so.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, the  IFP  expresses  its  concern  about  the
underfunding  in  this  department,  which  impedes  the  process  of   good
governance.

The IFP, despite this declaration, supports the Budget Vote.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party and New National Party dissenting).

Vote No 2 - Parliament - agreed to in accordance  with  section  75  of  the
Constitution.

Vote No 3 - Foreign Affairs - agreed to in accordance  with  section  75  of
the Constitution.

Vote No 4 - Home Affairs - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I am sorry that  we  are  opposing  this  Budget
Vote, because I have to say that I have the highest personal esteem for  the
Minister, who is a great gentleman and highly respected.

However, the impact on our society of the brain drain  outwards,  which  has
accelerated, and the brain gain inwards, which has slowed down,  is  one  of
the greatest single reasons for the underperformance of  the  South  African
economy. This  double  whammy  needs  to  be  addressed  satisfactorily  and
quickly if we wish to cauterise this  gaping  self-inflicted  wound  in  our
society.

Earlier today the findings of the research funded by the UK's  Economic  and
Social Research Council, conducted by the University of Cape  Town  and  the
University of London, were published according to today's Business Day.  Six
areas of specific concern were raised, including I will  quote  only  one  -
``an arbitrary and `obstructive' immigration and work permit system''.  That
is the finding of this particular study. Any of us who  have  been  involved
with constituency work would have had to endure this obstruction.
I do not want to go over the boring statistics. They are well known. I  have
mentioned them before in this House. The official total figure from 1998  to
2000 of people leaving is something like 16 000 highly skilled  people,  and
the brain gain of skilled people coming in is about a  quarter  of  what  it
was in 1998. In fact, we know these figures are hopelessly out, because  our
people leaving do not tell the immigration authorities in South  Africa  why
they are leaving, and our statistics department  cannot  pick  up  the  real
figures.

At present, we have a shortage estimated to be between 300 000  and  500 000
managers, and our education system is simply  not  delivering  fast  enough.
This double whammy is costing us goodwill, investment, employment, jobs  and
standards of health and education, and is accelerating the capital  outflow.
Although, of course, the Minister and his department cannot  be  blamed  for
many  of  the  underlying  circumstances,  his  department  has  effectively
obstructed the flow of skills and immigration to South Africa. We  therefore
oppose this Vote.
Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, I am presenting this declaration on behalf  of
the chair of the select committee, who is not around. Comrades and  friends,
I rise on behalf of the ANC ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  member,
can you use another microphone, because it seems that that one is  not  very
clear.

Ms Q D MAHLANGU:  But,  Chairperson,  this  microphone  was  working  a  few
minutes ago. [Interjections.]

Chairperson, as I was saying, I am rising on behalf  of  the  chair  of  the
Select Committee on Social Services. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order, hon members!

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: But it is not my fault that the microphone is not working.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Hon  member,  can  you
try another microphone?

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, as I was saying,  I  rise  on  behalf  of  the
chairperson on the Select Committee  on  Social  Services  to  present  this
declaration. Comrades and friends, I rise on behalf of the  ANC  to  support
the Home Affairs Budget  Vote.  I  urge  everyone  who  believes  in  taking
forward the transformation process of our country to vote  for  this  Budget
Vote without reservation.

There are various issues that the Government has to  deal  with  in  undoing
the damage done by the long years of apartheid destruction.  The  department
has the huge task of ensuring that identity and  South  African  citizenship
remain intact.

There are a few issues that I want to  raise,  among  the  issues  that  the
Department of Home Affairs deals with. These  are  the  issue  of  migration
control,  the  control  system  at  our   border   posts,   the   issue   of
transformation  within   the   Department   of   Home   Affairs,   and   the
implementation of the Batho Pele principle.

We  believe,  as  the  ANC,  that  with  the  resources  allocated  to  this
department, they  will  be  able  to  execute  their  duties  as  per  their
programmes. Therefore the ANC supports the Budget Vote.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson and the House, although the IFP  supports  the
Vote, we must make some declarations on Vote No 4: Home Affairs.

The IFP declares that the department is extremely underfunded and yet it  is
expected to do good work, which is  very  difficult  to  perform  with  such
financial constraints. The IFP supports the Vote, but feels  that  something
must be done to rectify the financial underfunding of  this  department.  It
is extremely underfunded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! There is a  big
problem with the sound. Maybe those who objected when we said we  wanted  to
refurbish the NCOP will understand  why  we  insisted  on  refurbishing  it.
[Laughter.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party, New  National  Party  and  African  Christian  Democratic
Party dissenting).

Vote No 5 - Provincial and Local Government - put.

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, we are unable to hear what people  are  saying.  We
would be better off if we switched the whole system off.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! I did not  even
hear what you were saying, hon member. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

Ms C BOTHA: That is what I am talking about.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  Could  the
Table get  a  report  on  the  situation?  We  cannot  continue  like  this.
[Interjections.]

Order! Can the UDM try to give their declaration of vote?  Maybe  they  will
be lucky. [Interjections.]

Maybe we should take a five-minute adjournment so that  this  thing  can  be
attended to. We will adjourn for five minutes.

Business suspended at 14:51 and resumed at 15:17.

Declarations of vote:

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, the UDM votes in favour  of  this  Budget  Vote
and wishes to put on record the following observations for consideration  by
the Minister and this House. The financial viability of many  municipalities
has been brought into question, especially  in  rural  areas,  and  this  is
exacerbated by the culture of nonpayment in many areas.

The delivery of basic services is implemented at the local level, and it  is
often here that success or failure occurs.  In  the  light  of  Government's
constitutional obligation to deliver this basic service free  of  charge  to
the poor, as well as commitments for the provision of water and  electricity
to all, it is vital that capacity and expertise be developed at local  level
to ensure the successful delivery of these services. We vote  in  favour  of
this Vote.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): I did not  check  with
the IFP. Just indicate your intentions to me, because I was  not  warned  in
advance. Please make your declaration.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Thank you, Chairperson. The IFP has  this  declaration  to
make. Unfulfilled promises to settle the traditional leaders'  concerns  are
putting problems in the way of the effective implementation of  the  policy.
Instead,  unnecessary  barriers  to  co-operative  governance  hinder   work
performance. Though  the  IFP  supports  the  Budget  Vote,  we  have  these
concerns, and the sooner they are settled, the better.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party and New National Party dissenting).

Vote No 6 - Government Communication and Information System - agreed  to  in
accordance with section 75 of the Constitution  (Democratic  Party  and  New
National Party dissenting).

An HON MEMBER: Chairperson, we still have a problem with the sound system.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  We  will  attend  to
that when we come to it.

Vote No 7 - National Treasury - agreed to in accordance with section  75  of
the Constitution.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  I  think  we
will have to go to Committee Room E249. [Interjections.] I am told  that  we
should go to the Old Assembly Chamber.

Business suspended at 15:20 and resumed at 15:35.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon members,  I
will allow you to address the House seated. You do  not  have  to  stand  up
when addressing the Council here in Committee Room E249. I am  not  used  to
this chair and the microphone is far away. I  do  not  know  whether  I  can
bring it nearer.

Vote No 8 - Public Enterprises - agreed to in accordance with section 75  of
the Constitution (Democratic Party and New National Party dissenting).

Vote No 9 - Public Service and Administration  -  agreed  to  in  accordance
with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 10 - Public Service  Commission  -  agreed  to  in  accordance  with
section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 11 - SA Management Development Institute - agreed to  in  accordance
with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 12 - Statistics South Africa - agreed to in accordance with  section
75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 13 - Arts, Culture, Science and Technology - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, alhoewel die Department van Kuns,  Kultuur,
Wetenskap en Tegnologie alles in hul vermoë doen om hul mandaat tot  uitvoer
te bring, is daar egter 'n paar aspekte wat ons teleurstel.  Ongelukkig  ...
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, although the Department of Arts,  Culture,
Science and Technology is doing everything  in  its  power  to  realise  its
mandate,  there  are,  however,  a   few   aspects   that   disappoint   us.
Unfortunately ... [Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! What is  wrong,
hon members?

An HON  MEMBER:  There  is  no  interpretation  and  we  do  not  understand
Afrikaans. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Well,  unfortunately,
members did  not  bring  their  listening  devices  along.  [Interjections.]
Order! Can we proceed? We have all official languages in this Council.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, in order  to  accommodate  members  I  will
address the House in English.  I  cannot  do  so  in  the  other  indigenous
languages, though.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  members,
there is a lot of conversation in the House.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, although the Department of  Arts,  Culture,
Science and Technology really performs in specific areas,  we  do  not  have
time to discuss these in detail today. But I am sure  that  when  we  debate
the budget when we come back, we will talk about these in depth.  Until  now
we have not had the opportunity to do so.

But there are two aspects that really concern us.  The  first  is  that  the
department has failed to comply with the Act in appointing a PanSALB  board.
After seven years it has failed to comply with  the  constitutional  demands
that we should have a language policy and  Bill.  These  are  still  not  in
place.

As  I  said,  there  are  many  positive  aspects  about  the   department's
activities, but these two and the others which  we  will  discuss  later  on
make it very difficult for us to support this Vote.

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, the ANC supports Budget Vote No 13. I also  want
to indicate that, as we know, arts and culture are  actually  close  to  our
hearts, all of us, irrespective of whether we come from different  political
persuasions. The fact remains that the  department  is  now  engaging  in  a
process in which we need to transform  society  and  we  are  aware  that  a
number of Bills are coming up. We are grappling with that.

We will see as we  go  on  in  the  process  that  there  are  a  number  of
activities that we have to deal with, all of us.  They  involve  almost  all
the departments. Cultural activities have a treasured place  in  our  hearts
and we want to express appreciation at what the department has  done  up  to
now. The Budget Vote  will  enable  us  to  continue  with  the  forthcoming
programmes. With this, we support the Vote enthusiastically.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party and New National Party dissenting).

Vote No 14 - Education - put.

Declarations of vote:
Mev J WITBOOI: Voorsitter, die NNP wil hiermee die  volgende  stemverklaring
doen. Op grond van ons bruto binnelandse produk bestee Suid-Afrika meer  aan
onderwys, dit is omtrent 6,9%, as die meeste lande ter wêreld.

Tog word dié inset nie in die uitslag weerspieël  nie.  Dit  is  onrusbarend
dat daar, ná 12 lange jare op skool, steeds 43% van ons leerders is wat  nie
in hul matriekjaar die slaagsyfer kan behaal nie.

Daar is ook nog te veel skole wat nie die nodige geriewe het  nie.  Dit,  en
onder   meer   die   feit   dat   daar   in   ons   land   omtrent    85 000
ondergekwalifiseerde onderwysers in ons totale onderwyskorps is,  veroorsaak
dat gehalte onderrig steeds ontbreek.

Dit is vir  die  Nuwe  NP  baie  moeilik  om  dié  begrotingspos  te  steun.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mrs J WITBOOI: Chairperson, the New NP would like  to  make  the  following
declaration of vote. Based on our gross domestic product,  South  Africa  is
spending more on education, about 6,9%, than most countries in the world.

Yet this input is not reflected in the results. It  is  disconcerting  that,
after 12 long years at school, 43% of  our  learners  are  still  unable  to
obtain pass marks in their matric year.

There are also far too many schools in want  of  the  necessary  facilities.
This, and  among  others  the  fact  that  our  country  has  about  85  000
underqualified teachers in our total teachers corps, is what gives  rise  to
the deficiency in quality education.

It is very difficult for the New NP to support this Vote.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, in answer to a recent question on  the  Question
Paper of the NCOP that dealt with the exodus of South African teachers  from
South Africa and whether he  was  taking  any  steps  in  this  regard,  the
Minister replied, inter alia, that, firstly, 68 Cuban  teachers  would  come
and  assist  with  teacher  training  in  South  Africa;  secondly,  he  was
preparing  a bilateral agreement with his counterpart in  the  UK,  Minister
Blunkett, to limit and prescribe the employment of  South  African  teachers
in the UK; and lastly, he was looking, with the Minister of Labour,  at  the
rights of people to advertise  for  and  recruit  skilled  people  in  South
Africa.

Thus he wishes to take  a  step  in  a  direction  which  is  tantamount  to
creating a closed society by inhibiting the  rights  and  freedom  of  South
Africans to work where they like. We too deplore people leaving our  country
permanently, and discourage them from doing so, but  there  are  often  good
reasons for leaving, ie retrenchment or inability  to  find  work  in  South
Africa.

We believe, however, that any attempt at cutting off South  Africans'  right
to move and work where they wish will be found to  be  not  only  wrong  and
unfair, but also an infringement of their constitutional rights,  let  alone
the morality of interfering in the internal affairs of a  friendly  country.
This kind of statement also has the unintended effect  of  accelerating  the
exodus, as people think,'' I had better go while I can.''

We respectfully request the Minister to desist from this kind of thing.  Let
us create conditions in our country that make people want  to  stay  in  the
land of their birth. That includes maintaining and  improving  standards  of
education for all our people. After a calamitous start by the  hon  Minister
Bhengu, we are not at all satisfied that sufficient progress is  being  made
and we therefore vote against this Vote.

Mr N M RAJU: Mr Chairperson, hon delegates, let us for a  moment  move  back
and survey the educational  landscape.  If  one  is  to  adopt  a  fair  and
nonpartisan stance, one is faced with bleakness, and darkness casts  a  pall
over the hills. On the ground, in many schools in  the  rural  areas,  there
are no toilets. If there are, they are invariably not working. There are  no
desks or chalkboards in some classrooms,  there  are  not  enough  teachers,
there is no electricity, and, more importantly for me, there are no  playing
fields.

If we then  turn  our  gaze  to  some  of  the  urban  schools,  an  equally
depressing scenario unfolds: indiscipline among teachers and pupils, a  lack
of libraries and/or science laboratories. Worse still,  one  is  faced  with
frightened and scarred young schoolgirls who have  been  victims  of  either
sexual abuse or sexual violence  and  also  frightened  by  the  scourge  of
HIV/Aids which is continuing to take its inexorable toll  on  young  people,
the very flowers of our society.

So, on the ground, despite all the grandiose plans  and  strategies  of  the
Education Ministry,  under,  we  concede,  a  hard-working  and  industrious
Minister, the lack of adequate delivery dictates  that  the  DP  has  second
thoughts about supporting the Budget Vote. We do not support the Vote.

Mr D M KGWARE: Mr Chairperson, the ANC supports Vote  No  14,  an  Education
budget that reaches every ventricle  of  South  Africa's  schooling  system,
namely the areas of primary,  secondary,  higher  and  adult  learning.  Our
unanimously held view is that this budget not only  increases  the  momentum
of transformation, but also addresses the moral fibre and lack of the  unity
of purpose that we, as a nation, need to succeed.

Special cognisance must be taken of the fact that we are now  in  our  third
period of education reform. Whereas the first and second  phases  emphasised
the need for  the  creation  of  a  framework  for  transformation,  greater
accountability  and  delivery,  we  have  now  shifted  gear   towards   the
attainment of greater equity and quality  of  learning.  However,  we  still
have a long way to go in achieving the required  levels  of  equity  in  our
schooling system.

This budget has met all the requirements and expectations  of  an  education
sector in transition. Some of the programmes, like school effectiveness  and
educator professionalism, school  safety  and  the  further  development  of
school governing bodies, are indeed pioneering work done by  the  Department
of  Education.  It  is  therefore  against  this  backdrop   of   unequalled
commitment that we, in  the  spirit  of  Tirisano,  support  the  budget  in
unison.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Mr Chairperson, the IFP, although  supporting  the  Budget
Vote, feels that the implementation of the policy at provincial level  means
that 90% of the budget  goes  to  personnel,  leaving  only  10%  for  other
departmental needs. The IFP is very concerned about  this,  but  we  support
the Budget Vote.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party, New  National  Party  and  African  Christian  Democratic
Party dissenting).

Ms J L KGOALI: Mr Chairperson,  we  are  making  this  appeal  through  you.
Considering the problem that we are faced with here, namely that we  do  not
have an interpreting mechanism to help us understand what the other  parties
are saying, can we, for the sake of the proceedings here  today,  all  speak
the language that we all understand? We want to understand  what  the  other
hon members are saying.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Hon  member,  I  leave
it to hon members. I do not want  to  make  a  ruling,  because  anybody  is
allowed to speak any language. I therefore do not want to make that  ruling.
If there is no translation and hon members feel we cannot proceed,  we  will
adjourn.

That is the only option. I will leave it to members themselves. This is  hon
members' House, I do not want to make any rulings on this matter.

Vote No 15 - Health - put.

Declarations of vote:

Dr P J C NEL: Meneer die Voorsitter, alhoewel die  Nuwe  NP  waardering  het
vir sekere programme  soos  byvoorbeeld  die  primêre  gesondheidsorgprogram
waarmee daar 'n taamlike  mate  van  sukses  behaal  is,  het  ons  ernstige
bedenkinge oor 'n aantal ander aspekte.

Die onderbefondsing van gesondheidsdienste en die swak bestuur van geld  wat
wel toegeken word, gee aanleiding tot die agteruitgang  en  verval  van  die
departement  se  infrastruktuur,  die  veroudering   en   agteruitgang   van
toerusting wat nie vervang of herstel kan word nie, die verlies van  kundige
mediese  personeel  uit  die  stelsel  as  gevolg  van  swak  salarisse   en
werksomstandighede, die onvermoë om uitstaande skuld in te  vorder,  en  die
onvermoë om die verlies van medisyne en toerusting as  gevolg  van  diefstal
die hoof te bied, om maar 'n paar aspekte te noem. Dit is onverskoonbaar.

Dit alles het tot  die  byna  totale  ineenstorting  van  die  lewering  van
gesondheidsdienste in sommige staatshospitale aanleiding gegee.  In  Gauteng
het  'n  oudit  van  staatshospitale  onlangs  bevind  dat   94%   van   die
geouditeerde hospitale op die rand van ineenstorting staan.

Die Nuwe NP is bekommerd oor die onvermoë van die Regering om 'n ferm  greep
te kry op die MIV/vigs-probleem, die ergste  epidemie  in  menseheugenis  in
die Republiek van Suid-Afrika. Ons is  ook  bekommerd  oor  die  versuim  en
weiering om van die bestaande antiretrovirale middels  gebruik  te  maak  in
die  behandeling  van   MIV/vigs.   Ek   moes   gister   verneem   dat   die
protokoldokument oor moeder-tot-kind oordrag wat ek aangevra  het,  nog  nie
gefinaliseer is nie. Dit is totaal en al onaanvaarbaar.

Ons  moes  vanoggend  via  die  media  verneem  dat  ons  agb  President  in
Washington, waar hy hom tans bevind, in antwoord op 'n  vraag  wat  aan  hom
gestel is, gesê het hy weet nie of die MI-virus vigs  veroorsaak  nie,  maar
dat sy siening oor vigs nie relevant vir die Regering se benadering tot  die
MIV/vigs-probleem is nie. Dit stuur 'n verwarrende boodskap  aan  ons  mense
en die res van die wêreld. Dit is onaanvaarbaar en betreurenswaardig.

Weens bogenoemde redes kan die Nuwe NP nie die Begrotingspos oor  Gesondheid
steun nie. [Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Mr Chairperson, although the  New  NP  has  appreciation  for
certain programmes, such as, for example, the primary health programme  with
which a great deal of success has been  attained,  we  have  serious  doubts
about a number of other aspects.

The underfunding of health services and the poor management of  money  which
has been allocated, give rise  to  the  deterioration  and  decline  of  the
department's infrastructure,  the  dating  and  deterioration  of  equipment
which cannot be replaced or repaired, the loss of expert medical  staff  out
of the system  as  a  result  of  unattractive  salaries  and  poor  working
conditions, and the inability to recover outstanding debt  as  well  as  the
inability to stem the loss of medicines and equipment as a result of  theft,
to mention but a few aspects. This is inexcusable.

All this has led to the almost total collapse  of  the  delivery  of  health
services in certain state hospitals. In Gauteng an audit of state  hospitals
found that 94% of the audited hospitals were on the brink of collapse.

The New NP is concerned about the inability of  the  Government  to  take  a
firm grasp on the HIV/Aids problem, the worst epidemic in living  memory  in
the Republic of South Africa. We are also concerned about  the  failure  and
refusal to use the existing antiretrovirals in the  treatment  of  HIV/Aids.
Yesterday I learnt that the protocol document on  mother-to-child  infection
which I have  asked  for  has  not  yet  been  finalised.  This  is  totally
unacceptable.

This morning we heard via the media that  our  hon  President  had  said  in
Washington, where he is currently visiting, in reply to a  question  put  to
him that he was not sure whether HIV  causes  Aids,  but  that  his  opinion
regarding Aids  was  not  relevant  to  the  Government's  approach  to  the
HIV/Aids problem. This sends a confusing message to our people and the  rest
of the world. This is unacceptable and deplorable.

Owing to the above-mentioned reasons the New NP cannot support  this  Health
Vote. [Time expired.]]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I am  prepared  to  translate  if  that  is
necessary for anybody. [Interjections.]

Mr K  D  S  DURR:  Mr  Chairman,  statistics  SA  estimates  that  the  life
expectancy in 1996 in South Africa was 52,1 years for  men  and  61,6  years
for women. The Medical Research Council estimates that, as a result  of  the
Aids epidemic, life expectancy has already dropped from 63 years in 1990  to
57 years in the year 2000. It is expected to  drop  to  about  40  years  by
2010, bringing it to amongst the lowest in the world.

This is the litmus  test  for  this  department.  The  relative  success  or
failure of  this  department  can,  statistically,  be  measured  absolutely
accurately and its relative success or failure can be precisely measured  by
the  demographics  of  life  expectancy.  What  has  been  the  response  of
Government? They go into denial - so much so that even the New  York  Herald
Tribune says that the actions of our Government on Aids may  have  condemned
millions to death in South Africa.
We therefore have no option but to oppose this Budget Vote.

Ms S N NTLABATI: Chairperson, as a Methodist I would sing ``Hallelujah''  if
singing were allowed in praise of this Vote in this House. [Interjections.]

The document is in line with our  documents,  the  original  being  the  ANC
health plan which was taken from the Freedom Charter. When  we  came  in  as
the ANC - I must tell the House - we were not empty-headed. We  had  a  plan
and we are still on track with our plan. It is useless to  oppose  something
when you have no plan and never had a plan. [Laughter.]

Ninety per cent of this national Health  budget  is  directly  allocated  to
provinces, reaffirming our inclination to help the poor. The  transformation
agenda is still on track. Regarding HIV/Aids, financial provision  is  there
to develop  and  strengthen  HIV/Aids  and  STD  programmes.  We  shall  not
implement the programmes following the agenda of somebody else.  The  agenda
of the ANC will be followed.

Immunisation programmes are in place.  What  else  is  wanted?  The  ANC  is
pleased to note that the Health budget places  an  emphasis  on  quality  of
health care. The Bill of Patients' Rights is there,  so  what  is  next?  We
shall be transforming training in  health  services,  training  people  with
Africa in mind. We will not be Eurocentric in our training.

We  anticipate   positive   outcomes   in   the   department   through   the
implementation of the Medicines and  Related  Substances  Control  Amendment
Bill. Hon members should remember that we overcame the case, and  the  truth
set us free. Again, for all of these reasons, the ANC is morally  bound  and
bound by the facts to support this Vote. I close by saying that it is  still
necessary that we look at the role poverty still plays in accelerating  this
scourge. [Applause.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party, New  National  Party  and  African  Christian  Democratic
Party dissenting).

Vote No 16 - Housing - agreed to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of  the
Constitution.

Vote No 17 - Social Development - put.

Declarations of Vote:

Mrs J WITBOOI: Chairperson, the budget allocation for  social  services  has
fallen from 48,5% of the consolidated expenditure to 46,7% in the year 2001-
02.

The Minister of Finance announced an increase in old age pensions from  R540
to R570, despite his assurances that grant  increases  would  be  inflation-
linked. And, according to Minister  Manuel,  additional  money  for  poverty
alleviation would come from the National  Development  Agency,  the  lottery
and the Umsobomvu Fund. The money  in  the  Umsobomvu  Fund,  created  as  a
result of the demutualisation of Sanlam and Old Mutual, which was  announced
in his 1998-99 Budget Speech, has still not been spent.

The New NP's greatest concern is the glaring gap  in  social  assistance  to
the poorest and most vulnerable people in South Africa. Therefore,  the  New
NP cannot support the Budget Vote.

Mr B WILLEM: Chairperson, the ANC  supports  Budget  Vote  No  17  -  Social
Development.

Social development is one of those areas on  which  we,  as  the  ANC,  have
always focused a great deal  of  our  attention,  because  we  believe  that
eradicating poverty is  the  key  to  empowering  our  people  economically,
socially and politically. Eliminating  the  unequal  power  relations  still
existing between the  haves  and  the  have-nots  is  one  of  the  enormous
physical challenges still facing this department.

The  ANC  salutes  the  Minister  of  Social  Development  for  setting  the
precedent of a hands-on approach to alleviating the scourge of  poverty  and
improving the  dignity  of  poor  people  in  our  communities  through  his
investigations and imbizos in the provinces. He has  helped  to  direct  the
department in the efficient delivery of services to those communities  where
they are most needed and towards unblocking  poor  service  delivery  areas.
This means, for example, that payment contractors who  fail  to  deliver  on
grant payments will either  have  to  improve  or  find  themselves  out  of
contracts.

Poverty alleviation programmes have also received  attention  through  their
failure to deliver to the poorest  of  the  poor.  Here  the  ANC,  in  this
committee, is committed both  to  supporting  the  Minister  in  identifying
those communities with needs in all  nine  provinces  and  to  assisting  in
distributing the funds where they are needed. We  are  convinced  that  with
this concerted effort, there will no longer be  a  community  without  food.
Again, the ANC supports this Vote. [Applause.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party and New National party dissenting).

Vote No 18 - Sport and Recreation South Africa - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr N M  RAJU:  Mr  Chairperson,  notwithstanding  the  noble  intentions  of
Minister Balfour, the good Minister  has  shown  a  disturbing  tendency  to
trespass on the autonomous terrain of sports organisations.

What we need in South African sport  is  less  Government  interference  and
more unfettered space for those constituencies that  comprise  our  sporting
fraternity. My party wishes to  withhold  its  support  for  the  Sport  and
Recreation Vote.

Mr D M KGWARE: Mr Chairperson, I  rise  here  to  declare  my  unconditional
support for the Sport and Recreation Budget Vote. The critical objective  of
this Budget Vote is to ensure universal  access  to  sporting  opportunities
and ultimately the eradication of every discriminatory hindrance in the  way
of aspirant sportspeople.
At present, we are still faced with the enormous  inequities  brought  about
by our divided past. The Budget Vote seeks to help  end  these  inequalities
that manifest themselves in every black township and leafy  suburb  in  this
country.

Over the past few years, we have seen the emergence of  highly  skilled  and
competent administrators and athletes who can hold  their  own  against  the
best in the world. These and other achievements are, certainly, some of  the
highlights of the Budget Votes, and were only possible through the  enormous
efforts of the Department of Sport  and  Recreation.  We  also  endorse  the
censure, by the Minister, of certain national federations that,  to  put  it
mildly, are refusing to come to the nonracial sports party.

The South African Boxing Bill and the South African Sports  Commission  Bill
have both gone through this House, and there is also the formal  lifting  of
the ban on female boxing. The latter, as envisaged, points to a smaller  and
more manageable sports structure. Moreover, both pieces of legislation  will
bring us into line with international practices.

The ANC will continue to champion the cause of a  nonracial,  nonsexist  and
democratic sporting arena and red-card those who  continue  to  be  offside.
Again, we support the Vote.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party and New National Party dissenting).

Vote No 19 - Correctional Services - agreed to in  accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 20 - Defence - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr J L THERON:  Chairperson,  because  of  all  the  recent  allegations  of
corruption regarding the  strategic  arms  procurement  deal,  the  DP  will
definitely not support this Budget  Vote.  The  strategic  arms  procurement
deal forms approximately 40% of the Defence Budget, and thus forms the  crux
of our objection to this Budget Vote.

Other reasons for our objection to this Budget Vote include  the  following:
failure to rightsize the SA National Defence Force to the  set  target;  too
many  troops  who  are  nondeployable  and  a  definite  lack  of  combat  -
readiness; too many generals and  not  enough  troops  for  deployment;  not
enough money allocated to the reserve forces  in  this  budget;  not  enough
funds allocated to finalise the integration process into the SANDF; and  the
R200 million in this year's Defence Budget for the President's aeroplane.

For all these substantial reasons,  the  DP  cannot  possibly  support  this
Defence Budget Vote.

Mrs C NKUNA: Chair, the ANC acknowledges that the Department of  Defence  is
a contingency-based organisation whose services are visible  only  when  and
where  the  National  Defence  Force  is  deployed  to  act  on  a  specific
contingency.

This department collaborates with a  range  of  governmental,  regional  and
international  players   to   ensure   that   national   security,   through
interventions, progressively realises the political,  economic,  social  and
cultural needs of the South  African  people  and  thus  maintains  regional
security. Therefore,  informed  by  the  massive  challenges  faced  by  the
Department of Defence, the Defence Vote has,  in  many  respects,  undergone
significant changes in  terms  of  programme  structure  and  allocation  of
resources.

This  has  led  to  the  formation  of  main  programmes  such  as  defence,
intelligence, command and  control,  whose  subprogrammes  include,  amongst
others, the consolidation and centralisation of the  finance  personnel  and
legal and management information.

Relative  to  the  above,  the  ANC  unconditionally  supports  the   budget
allocated to the Department of Defence with firm  confidence  that  it  will
ensure the department's effectiveness in  carrying  out  its  constitutional
challenges and duties. [Applause.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party and New National Party dissenting).

Vote No 21 - Independent Complaints Directorate - agreed  to  in  accordance
with section 75 of the  Constitution  (Democratic  Party  and  New  National
Party dissenting).

Vote No 22 - Justice and Constitutional Development - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, thanks for the  opportunity.  I  am  also  very
glad that I can make this declaration whilst our hon Minister of Finance  is
here. As indicated during question time, we were informed  by  the  National
Director of Public Prosecutions that, two years ago, the  need  had  already
been identified for 300 more public prosecutors. We have also been  informed
that there is an urgent need for more courts and magistrates. Although  this
will be prioritised, according to the Deputy Minister, the fact  is  that  -
and she admitted this - the shortages cannot  be  fully  addressed  by  this
budget. The terrible backlogs in cases are currently clogging up  the  whole
criminal justice system and need urgent attention.

Over the past four years the number of  awaiting-trial  prisoners  held  for
more than three months has increased from about 4 000 to over 27  000,  with
an average detention cycle time of 138  days.  Half  of  all  awaiting-trial
prisoners had been held for longer than four and a  half  months,  some  for
years.

Besides the awaiting-trial prisoners being deprived of their  constitutional
right to humane detention and a speedy trial,  the  cost  to  the  state  is
enormous. At R88 per day to house a prisoner, that amounts to  R5,6  million
per day to keep awaiting-trial  prisoners  in  prison.  Those  backlogs  are
caused by  the  fact  that  there  are  shortages  of  personnel,  including
prosecutors and magistrates, as I have indicated.

This is really, as we can see it, a matter of being  penny  wise  and  pound
foolish, because if money were spent on the prosecutors  and  on  addressing
those shortages, we  would  be  able  to  cut  down  on  the  awaiting-trial
prisoners and so be able, in  any  event,  to  save  that  money  which  now
amounts to R5,6 million per day. [Time expired.]

Mr J L MAHLANGU: Mr Chairperson, one of the  most  significant  developments
in  the  department  has  been  the  general  shift  away   from   personnel
expenditure towards increased expenditure on our courts, which is  the  core
business of the department. Since 1997 we have seen a fall in the  personnel
expenditure of 6% while the expenditure on equipping  courts  has  increased
by almost 4%.

If we look at the structure of  this  budget,  it  is  clear  that  an  even
greater allocation will be made to the administration  of  our  courts  over
the medium term. This will indeed significantly  enhance  the  effectiveness
of our courts in prosecuting criminals  and  will  build  on  the  successes
already achieved in terms of further increasing  the  number  of  hours  our
courts  are  sitting,  increasing  the  numbers  of   cases   finalised   by
prosecutors, increasing conviction rates and dealing  with  the  backlog  of
cases on our court rolls.

Other key  outputs  and  successful  service  delivery  trends  include  the
success of the Directorate of Special Operations in the  investigation  into
organised crime, corruption and urban terror, with notable success  in  both
the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal,  and  the  effectiveness  of  the  Asset
Forfeiture Unit in seizing millions of rands that are proceeds of crime.

The improvement of efficiency in the management  of  our  court  system  has
greatly improved the conditions of service of our  judicial  officers,  such
as  judges,  magistrates  and  prosecutors.  It  has  also   increased   the
confidence of the key beneficiaries of  our  justice  system,  such  as  our
sexually abused women, children and other victims of violent crime.

It is only fair that we  acknowledge  these  achievements  and  commend  the
Minister and his department for the manner in which they have applied  their
budget to the benefit of all the people of our country. We  have  absolutely
no doubt that they will do so to an even greater extent during  this  budget
cycle. Although seated, Chairperson, I  inwardly  rise  in  support  of  the
budget on behalf of the ANC.

We  strongly  believe  that  this  Budget  Vote  reaffirms  the   unshakable
commitment of the Minister of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  as
well as his department  to  continuing  on  the  road  of  transforming  our
justice system from one that was rejected and despised by  the  majority  of
our  people  to  one  that   is   internationally   acknowledged   for   its
accessibility, fairness and transparency. [Applause.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party, New  National  Party  and  African  Christian  Democratic
Party dissenting).

Vote No 23 - Safety and Security - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr P A MATTHEE: Mr Chairperson, already a few years ago, in the White  paper
on Safety and Security, the Government acknowledged that  it  was  necessary
to undertake an extensive strategy process to outline the  fixed  goals  and
timeframes for action in the short, medium and longer term  as  far  as  the
prevention and combating of crime was concerned.

Today we have again asked this question. We have  not  been  given  specific
answers as to what the goals are, where we are  going  with  crime  in  this
country and whether the shortages will be addressed in this budget.

It is clear that  all  the  shortages  referred  to  as  far  as  staff  and
equipment, including vehicles, are concerned seriously hamper the police  in
their  attempts  to  combat  and  prevent  crime  and  affect  their  morale
negatively. We understand that there was a  national  audit  in  respect  of
these shortages,  but  the  figures  have  not  been  given  to  us.  In  an
authoritative survey of almost 1 500 companies in South  Africa  last  year,
crime emerged as the single most important investment-inhibiting factor  for
small businesses and a major factor for large businesses.

It is clear that our country is losing billions of  rands  and  millions  of
job opportunities annually as a result of the unacceptably  high  levels  of
crime. Money wisely spent on  the  effective  combating  and  prevention  of
crime should not be seen as an expense but should be seen as an  investment.
It is certainly  the  best  investment  that  we  can  make  and  that  this
Government can make in the  future  of  our  country  and  our  people.  The
message must be clear  and  the  Government  must  be  clear  on  this:  The
fighting of crime and the combating and preventing thereof must receive  the
highest priority, and this is not happening at this stage. That  is  why  we
have the shortages that we are experiencing and  that  is  why  we  are  not
succeeding in drastically bringing down  the  unacceptably  high  levels  of
crime.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, the ACDP  opposes  this  Vote  because  a  South
African is more likely to be shot dead than to die in  a  traffic  accident,
and yet South Africa has the worst road death toll  in  the  world.  In  the
Western Cape, 69% of deaths of men between the ages of 15  and  44  resulted
from homicides or accidents, while the comparable figure for women  is  41%.
The rate of murder in South Africa in 1996  was  61  per  100  000  persons,
compared to an international norm of 5,5 per  100  000.  New  data  recently
released in August shows this has not  declined.  Police  reported  that  in
1998, 65 people were murdered each day. For that reason, we have  no  option
but to vote against this Bill. The Department  of  Safety  and  Security  is
simply not defending the population of this country.

Mr T B TAABE:  Chairperson,  given  the  fact  that  the  transformation  of
policing  in  this   country   has   required   substantial   organisational
restructuring and the development of strategic priorities to address  crime,
various policing agencies have been rationalised  and  amalgamated  to  form
the SAPS.  Their  activities  are  centred  on  combating  organised  crime,
serious and violent crime and crimes  against  women  and  children  and  on
improving  service  delivery  in  their  identified  pilot  police   station
services we have seen in this country.

As the ANC  we  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  remarkable  progress  the
Department of Safety and Security has indeed made over  the  past  years  on
its objectives of policing services in line with community  needs  and  laid
down constitutional principles. However,  these  and  other  objectives  and
responsibilities cannot be achieved by the SAPS alone, for they require  all
of us to give our necessary and undivided support. We  hope,  though  -  and
this point  has  got  to  be  made,  especially  as  we  are  going  to  our
constituencies - that indeed real leaders will emerge in  this  country  who
base their messages on hope, rather than on fear; on the  optimism  of  hard
work rather than the pessimism of armchair whining,  particularly  from  the
kind of confused opposition in this country  that  has  opposed  the  Budget
Vote on Safety and Security.

We are equally hopeful that the opposition  parties  will  engage  in  their
favourite pastime of running around  in  disarray  like  frightened  rabbits
during this constituency period. We wish them well.

The ANC, being  the  kind  of  organisation  that  we  are,  and  given  the
overwhelming mandate we have from the majority of South  Africans,  want  to
support this Vote without any reservation, for  we  believe  earnestly  that
that would be in the interest of a crime-free  South  Africa  and  a  better
life for all. [Time expired.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party, New  National  Party  and  African  Christian  Democratic
Party dissenting).

Vote No 24 - Agriculture - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, the President praised the  positive  attitude
of farmers regarding land reform.  Today  I  want  to  praise  the  hon  the
Minister, who applied her mind to this matter with  very  positive  results,
and urge her to stay on this road. I also commend  the  department  for  the
innovative prioritising of funds from land reform to restitution,  and  call
for public-private partnerships to deal with this important issue.

Although the DP is in favour of this Vote, there  are  some  grave  concerns
about research  at  certain  institutions,  for  example  Onderstepoort.  We
appeal to the Minister for more money for research  into  alternative  forms
of agriculture, for example saline agriculture.  Without  research  we  will
not be able to compete on the global market.

The DP supports this Budget Vote. [Interjections.]

Rev  P  MOATSHE:  Chairperson,  the  ANC  supports  the   Budget   Vote   on
Agriculture. We believe that this Ministry, through its  budget  allocation,
will move us closer to our main objectives. This budget will  also  move  us
closer to our objectives, which are feeding  the  nation  through  sustained
food security, maximising the contribution of  agriculture  to  the  economy
and ensuring that  all  of  our  people  nurture  and  protect  our  natural
resources for us today and for future generations.

Agriculture supports economic growth, especially in our remote  black  rural
areas, and the deracialisation of the agricultural  sector.  Of  course,  as
with most other departments, the ANC also believes that this budget does  as
it should, and that is to focus on poverty  eradication,  rural  development
and urban renewal in all provinces.

This budget will also contribute towards uplifting the emerging  farmers  to
grow, and to become competent in the field of commercial agriculture.

We strongly support this Vote.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 25 - Communications - agreed to in accordance  with  section  75  of
the  Constitution  (Democratic  Party,  New  National  Party   and   African
Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 26 - Environmental Affairs and Tourism - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek wil as vertrekpunt sê  dat  ons  hierdie
begrotingspos gaan steun.  Ons  wil  ook  die  Minister  en  sy  departement
gelukwens met die interaksie wat hulle met die komitee gehad het, veral  ook
rakende die voorgestelde nuwe plan ten opsigte van visserskwotas.  Ons  wens
hulle alle sterkte daarmee toe, en glo dat dit gaan help  om  die  korrupsie
wat daar in die gemeenskap en in die bedryf is aan bande te lê.

Dinge soos die korrupsie en die wanbestuur  wat  heers  by  Nasionale  Parke
maak dit vir ons moeilik om die begrotingspos te steun.  Die  afleggings  en
die sake wat ondersoek  gaan  word  in  die  Nasionale  Kruger  Wildtuin  is
tekenend hiervan.
Dit is jammer dat die komitee nie die geleentheid gehad het om  goed  genoeg
interaksie te kon hê met Satoer en met Nasionale Parke nie. Ons hoop  regtig
dit gaan verbeter. Dat daar 'n onmiddellike  ondersoek  moet  wees,  en  dat
optrede moet volg, na die wanbestuur in  Nasionale  Parke,  is  'n  voldonge
feit. Desnieteenstaande sien ons ons weg  oop  om  hierdie  begrotingpos  te
steun. (Translation of Afrikaans declaration of vote follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, as a point of departure,  I  want  to  say
that we will support this Budget Vote. We  also  want  to  congratulate  the
Minister and his department on the interaction which they enjoyed  with  the
committee, especially regarding the proposed plan with the  fishing  quotas.
We wish them all the best and hope that it will help them  to  restrict  the
corruption that exists in the community and in that industry.

Issues like corruption and  maladministration  that  are  prevalent  at  the
National Parks make it difficult for us to support the Budget Vote. The lay-
offs  and  the  cases  that  will  be  investigated  in  the  National  Park
illustrate this.

It is a pity that the  committee  did  not  have  the  opportunity  to  have
adequate interaction with Satour and with National Parks. We sincerely  hope
that things will improve. That there should be an  immediate  investigation,
and that action concerning the maladministration in  National  Parks  should
follow, is a foregone conclusion.  Nevertheless, we see  our  way  clear  to
supporting this Budget Vote.]

Mev A M VERSFELD: Voorsitter, die  Minister  van  Omgewingsake  en  Toerisme
verdien die A+ wat die Mail & Guardian aan die einde van die jaar  2000  aan
hom toegeken het.

Hoogtepunte vir die DP is die totstandkoming van die  ``peace  parks'',  die
vergroting  van  bewaringsgebiede,  die  herstrukturering  van  mariene-  en
kusbestuur en - dit is die belangrikste - die  instelling  van  visvangregte
vir die lang termyn,  die  monitering  van  ons  marienebronne,  die  ``Blue
Flag'' akkreditasie vir skoon en veilige strande en  die  uiters  belangrike
projekte vir die verligting  van  armoede  wat  werklik  en  daadwerklik  in
werking  gestel  word.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  declaration   of   vote
follows.)

[Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, the Minister of  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism deserves the A+ which the Mail & Guardian awarded him at the end  of
the year 2000.

Highlights for the  DP  are  the  establishment  of  the  peace  parks,  the
extension of conservation areas, the restructuring  of  marine  and  coastal
management - and this is the most important - the  introduction  of  fishing
rights for the long term, the monitoring of our marine resources,  the  Blue
Flag accreditation for clean and safe beaches and  the  extremely  important
projects for poverty relief which are really being implemented actively.]

There are, however, two areas of great concern. The  first  one  is  Satour.
Tourist numbers are dropping and Satour's budget  is  increasing.  Secondly,
National Parks has been without a financial  director  for  the  last  eight
months. The Kruger National Park is the flagship of SA  National  Parks  and
South African tourism. The DP has been aware, and  has  evidence,  of  gross
irregularities in the administration of the Kruger  National  Park  for  the
last 18 months.

Theft and fraud are costing the park millions of rands every  year.  The  DP
cannot understand why there is not  an  in-depth,  full-scale  investigation
into the  affairs  of  SA  National  Parks  and,  specifically,  the  Kruger
National Park. Facts appear to prove that thousands, or  even  millions,  of
rands are being spent on court cases. However, because of the Minister,  and
the good work that he has done, the DP supports this Budget Vote.

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, the ANC supports  this  Budget  Vote  as  it  is
extremely important. By promoting responsible tourism, we will  be  able  to
strike a balance between  job  creation  and  the  sustainable  use  of  our
biological resources and heritage aimed  at  managing  the  development  and
conservation  of  our  marine  and  coastal  environment  and  environmental
management capacity-building in all spheres of Government.

Some of the key  outputs  with  regard  to  tourism  relate  to  its  annual
contribution  of  about  R25  billion  to  the  economy.   This   represents
approximately 4,9% of our GDP, and it is growing.

Furthermore, the number of tourists is growing by about 12%  per  annum.  If
one keeps in mind that one job is created for every  eight  tourists  coming
to our country, then one realises that the  potential  which  tourism  holds
for job creation is immense.

In terms  of  environmental  protection  and  management,  the  key  service
delivery  trends  include  the  launching  of  the  national  state  of  the
environment report and  the  Cites  environmental  report  on  the  Internet
initiative. The department has also realised its White Paper  on  Integrated
Pollution  and  Waste  Management  for  South  Africa.  In   addition,   the
department  assisted  various  local  governments   to   include   strategic
environmental assessment in their  respective  local  government  integrated
development plans.

The ANC believes that the Budget Vote reflects  a  firm  commitment  on  the
part of the  Minister  of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  to  further
transform the industry  and  make  it  more  accessible  to  the  previously
disadvantaged communities with tourism potential. We strongly  believe  this
Budget Vote will help create  the  conditions  for  increased  job  creation
opportunities for these communities. Therefore we give  it  our  unqualified
support.

Vote agreed in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 27 - Labour - put.

Declarations of vote:

Ms C BOTHA: Mr Chairperson, it is natural to assume  that  the  Minister  of
Labour is the one person in  the  country  whose  major  concern  should  be
finding ways to  employ  and  train  people.  Unfortunately,  the  financial
statements of the department, which we have just received, do not  fill  the
DP with any confidence that this is indeed  within  the  capability  of  the
Minister to deliver. I need not spell out  the  parlous  state  of  the  old
Unemployment  Insurance  Fund,  which  is  still  not  finalised,  nor   the
untenable discrepancies in the new Bill.

Furthermore, if we look at the new budget over the  next  three  years,  the
department says it intends focusing on the development of a national  skills
development plan. We are happy about  the  intention,  but  totally  dubious
about the outcome.

Their own practical business school, which spent about R30 000 per  student,
had not even made provision for the  accreditation  of  their  own  training
centre. Certificates could therefore  not  be  issued  at  the  end  of  the
relevant training projects.

As for creating employment, savings were made  on  five  programmes  of  the
Department of Labour. But this is owing to vacancies not being filled -  all
this while consultant services were rendered, which were not budgeted for.

As for labour reform, well, if a business had to  reform  at  the  rate  the
Minister is taking to fulfil his undertakings, it would have  had  to  close
shop long ago.

The  Minister  is  producing  unimplementable  legislation.  He  is  forcing
employers to comply with inappropriate laws. He is taxing  them  for  skills
development while his own programme shows no grasp of  the  complexities  of
implementation. It  is  therefore  unfortunate  that  the  Minister  or  the
Minister's performance has obliged the DP to declare our objection  to  Vote
27.

Mr S L E  FENYANE:  Mr  Chairperson,  the  ANC  supports  the  Vote  without
reservations. We want to place on record the following ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Could you  speak  into
the mike, please.

Mr S L E FENYANE: The mike is  very  far,  and  I  have  indicated  to  some
enthusiastic members  of  this  House  that  I  am  too  short.  However,  I
appreciate that.

Let me read the declaration from the ANC. The ANC supports the Vote  without
reservations and wishes to place on record the following,  that  the  labour
market is infested with huge  problems  regarding  the  incidence  of  child
labour and unfair labour practices. However, the  Minister  has  drastically
improved the situation and resolved some of  the  problems  that  beset  the
running of his department.

The department, under the admirable stewardship of the Minister  of  Labour,
Mr Mdladlana, has managed to consult successfully with labour  and  business
within the Nedlac processes, for the amendment of labour laws  such  as  the
Labour Relations Act, in  order  to  put  them  in  line  with  contemporary
developments in the labour market.

The Minister has made a promise to effect  terminations  in  line  with  the
provisions of the Basic Conditions  of  Employment  Act,  to  alleviate  the
plight of domestic and farm-workers.  The  department  has  put  systems  in
place to uphold co-operative governance and to  enhance  efficiency  in  the
running of the department. The ANC  therefore  supports  the  Vote  with  no
reservations, as I indicated.

With the introduction of the Skills Development  Act,  the  department  will
definitely improve the skills of the South African workforce.  We  therefore
believe that the Minister is on course and doing the right  thing.  The  ANC
supports the Vote.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party and New National Party dissenting).

Vote No 28 - Land Affairs - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr R M NYAKANE: Mr Chairperson, the UDM votes in favour  of  this  Vote  and
wishes  to  put  on  record  the  following:  that  the  process   of   land
redistribution and restitution needs to be reviewed in  order  to  speed  up
delivery. Land invasions  remain  an  unacceptable  form  of  behaviour  and
should thus be condemned in the strongest possible terms.

The successful recovery of land by the claimants should not  be  an  end  in
itself, as appears to be the case currently. It is simply not acceptable  to
settle people on land without the most basic infrastructure. Integrated  and
interdepartmental  land  reform  funding  should  be  established  for   the
provision of the basic infrastructure and essential services such as  water,
clinics, roads, streets, cemeteries, classrooms and shops.

The UDM supports this Vote.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  member,
you are crossing the line and you are interrupting the proceedings.

Mr S L E FENYANE: Chairperson, I thought I was too short to be noticed.
Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 29 - Minerals and Energy - agreed to in accordance with  section  75
of the Constitution.

Vote No 30 - Public Works - agreed to in accordance with section 75  of  the
Constitution.

Vote No 31 - Trade and Industry - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr A  E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  sorry,  there  is  a  mistake  on  the
programme. It should say ``New NP'' and not ``DP''. May I proceed?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Where  is  the
mistake?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, regarding Vote No 31 - Trade and  Industry,
the programme should indicate the New NP and not  the  DP.  May  I  proceed?
[Interjections.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  Order,  hon
members!  [Interjections.]  Order,  Ms  Mahlangu   and   Mr   Van   Niekerk.
[Interjections.] I have named you now.  [Interjections.]  Can  you  proceed,
hon member?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson,  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry,
under whose direct control the National Lotteries Board functions, is  being
criticised on two aspects of their gambling  and  lotteries  administration,
namely, firstly, the fact that no finality  has  been  reached  on  regular,
equitable and sustainable payouts of lottery funds  to  the  many  deserving
welfare organisations which were previously able  to  make  ends  meet  from
their own fundraising campaigns, something they are now not able to  do  any
more in terms of the existing legislation, and, secondly, the fact that  the
implementation of the euphemistically named ``limited payout machines'',  or
so-called one-arm bandits, will strip the poorer parts of the  community  of
their last few cents, despite widespread concern  and  opposition  from  the
welfare administration community.
Although the Department of Trade and Industry performs a commendable job  in
other fields and aspects of its area of responsibility, the New NP, in  view
of the above, cannot support this Vote.

Mr M BHABHA: Chairperson, since the inception  of  democracy  in  1994,  the
Department of Trade and Industry has charted a remarkable pattern of  growth
and recovery in the economy  of  South  Africa.  This  department  has  been
responsible for opening up the markets of the  European  Union,  the  United
States, Mercosur and the Far East. This has resulted in very  large  numbers
of investments being attracted into this country.

The department has embarked upon industrial development  zones  in  no  less
than 177 different areas in the country. It  has  embarked  upon  successful
incentive initiatives to grow certain  sectors  and  industries,  which  are
strategic from the South African point of view, with the result that it  has
strengthened our ability to participate in the new  global  environment.  In
doing so, the department has also made South Africa one of  those  countries
on the continent of  Africa  that  participates  in  information  technology
initiatives, in the way in which any other  First  World  country  would  be
able to participate.

From that point of view, I think  that  the  DP's  objection  to  this  Vote
merely because of some administrative problems of the  National  Lottery  is
disappointing.

When the Department of Trade and Industry called for  organisations  to  ask
for money from the lottery, only about  700  organisations  asked  for  that
money. The New NP is aware of the fact that both the ANC and the  Department
of Trade and Industry want to limit the usage of limited payout machines  in
different parts of the  country,  and  want  to  do  an  assessment  of  the
socioeconomic impact of gambling in this country. So one is  actually  quite
disappointed that the New NP has misrepresented the viewpoint  of  both  the
ANC and the Department of Trade and  Industry.  I  call  on  this  House  to
support this Vote.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Party and New National Party dissenting).

Vote No 32 - Transport - put.

Declaration of vote:

Dr P J C NEL: Mnr die Voorsitter, die Nuwe NP glo dat die  agb  Minister  sy
bes doen  om  die  padnetwerk  in  stand  te  hou  met  die  fondse  tot  sy
beskikking, wat totaal en al onvoldoende is. Alhoewel die Regering  van  die
dag hoog opgee dat die uitbouing en onderhoud van die infrastruktuur van  sy
vervoerstelsel die hoogste prioriteit geniet, is  dit  tog  vreemd  dat  die
toekenning van fondse vir hierdie doel jaarliks met reëlmaat besnoei word.

Ek kan die woorde van die Minister self in dié verband gebruik.  Hy  het  'n
tyd gelede in die gekose komitee onder meer gesê:


  Wanneer dit kom by die toekenning van fondse vir paaie, wil  dit  voorkom
  asof daar altyd die een of ander projek is  wat  belangriker  is  as  die
  padbouprojekte.

Onlangse statistiek het getoon dat daar op die oomblik 'n agterstand in  die
onderhoud van die padnetwerk van R65 miljard is.  As  dié  geld  nie  gevind
word nie, gaan die ekonomiese en  maatskaplike  ontwikkeling  van  ons  mooi
land totaal en al ineenstort.

Die lewering van pad-, spoor-, see- en pyplynvervoerstelsels is die  primêre
verantwoordelikheid van die Staat. Solank as wat die  Staat  versuim  om  sy
plig in dié verband na te kom en solank as wat die taxibedryf nie  behoorlik
deur hierdie departement beheer kan word  nie,  kan  die  Nuwe  NP  nie  die
Vervoerbegrotingspos steun nie. (Translation  of  Afrikaans  declaration  of
vote follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Mr  Chairperson,  the  New  NP  believes  that  the  hon  the
Minister is doing his best to maintain the road network with  the  funds  at
his disposal, which are completely inadequate.  Even though  the  Government
of the day boasts that the extension and maintenance of  the  infrastructure
of its transport system enjoys  the  highest  priority,  it  is  still  very
strange  that  the  allocation  of  funds  for  this  purpose  is  cut  with
regularity on an annual basis.

I can use the Minister's own words in this  regard.  A  while  back  in  the
select committee he said, inter alia, the following:


  Wanneer dit kom by die toekenning van fondse vir paaie, wil  dit  voorkom
  asof daar altyd die een of ander projek is  wat  belangriker  is  as  die
  padbouprojekte.

Recent statistics have shown that  there  is  currently  a  backlog  of  R65
billion in the maintenance of the road network. If this money is not  found,
the  economic  and  social  development  of  our  beautiful   country   will
completely collapse.

The provision of road, rail, maritime and pipeline transport systems is  the
primary responsibility of the state.  As long as the state does  not  fulfil
its duty in this regard and as long as the taxi industry is  not  adequately
controlled by this department, the  New  NP  cannot  support  the  Transport
Vote.]

(Translation of Sesotho declaration of vote follows.)

[Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, thank  you.  The  ANC  supports  the  Transport
Budget Vote without any hesitation.

The roads in our country, South Africa, still show that  they  are  some  of
the better developed roads, compared to those in the countries that we  call
developed countries. Economic growth, which occurs  through  the  roads,  is
important to us, and we intend to carry that suggestion through.

The Transport department's Arrive Alive campaign is  one  of  the  campaigns
that  urge  us  to  point  out,  without  any  hesitation,  the  development
strategies that have taken place through this department.

Therefore, we would like to say that the ANC is right  on  track,  according
to the  way  in  which  we  have  done  our  construction.  We  support  the
department. [Applause.]]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution

Vote No 33 - Water Affairs and Forestry - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, the DP is of the opinion  that  the  Minister
has achieved important goals, and that we want to give our  support  to  the
work that he has done, especially the Working for  Water  project.  However,
according to the report by the  Auditor-General,  community  water  projects
are not working well. The warning lights are thus flickering.

Newspaper reports in the last week indicate that the Minister plans  to  put
the Skuifraam Dam on hold. This is exactly what I asked  in  the  debate  on
his Budget Vote. I would urge the Minister to implement the  proposals  that
I made, otherwise Cape Town will have a shortage of water, and the DP and  I
will have to carry the blame, as the  ANC  is  very  good  at  shifting  the
blame. However, the DP supports this Vote.
[Laughter.]

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, the ANC  supports  this  Budget  Vote,  and  also
endorses  the  key  approaches  of  the  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry.

Amanzi ayimpilo. [Water is health.]

Water is  life.  This  forms  the  gist  of  the  Department  of  Water  and
Forestry's  strategy  and  can  be  understood  to  imply  that   water   is
indispensable to survival, and that there can be no livelihood,  growth  and
economic development in its absence. In this drought-prone and  water-scarce
country, it is our responsibility to ensure water security at all times.

With reference to the community water service programme,  the  Minister  was
emphatic that at the current rate of progress, within seven years we  should
be celebrating the fact that virtually all our people have, at last,  access
to clean drinking water. In the year 2008, a shameful  legacy  of  the  past
will have been wiped out and Government's pledge to provide all  with  clean
water will have been achieved.

With regard to the free basic water policy for the poor, we  as  members  of
this House need to congratulate the 21  municipalities  which  have  already
initiated the programme. A programme of support and guidance  is  under  way
to help all local government structures implement the policy  from  1  July,
local government budget day.

With reference to cholera, the department remains  very  steadfast  that  it
will not be complacent. The Minister has spelt out  three  key  requirements
for eradicating  cholera  and  other  waterborne  diseases:  providing  safe
water, adequate sanitation and health and hygiene education.

Crisis management of cholera included R35 million  which  was  provided  for
emergency water and sanitation  services  in  KwaZulu-Natal.  Over  100  000
people were provided with safe water in cholera-affected  areas.  Sanitation
was provided for 52 000  people,  disused  boreholes  repaired  and  springs
protected. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, I  move  the  adoption  of  the  Bill.
[Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, it is very difficult  to  speak  when  one  is
seated, but I will try my best to rise to the challenge.  My  microphone  is
broken.
There has been an overall increase in revenue collected, therefore  creating
an enabling environment for increased shares for different  departments  and
spheres of government. We must congratulate the SA  Revenue  Service  which,
for three consecutive years, has exceeded the targets it has set for  itself
in collecting revenue. We must  also  praise  South  African  taxpayers  who
continue to co-operate very diligently with Sars.

Research has shown that despite the relative  wealth  of  our  country,  the
experience of most South African households ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! I want to  draw
your attention to the fact that we are dealing with Order  No  2,  which  is
the Appropriation Bill.

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: But, Chairperson, those people are making a noise.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  Could  you
please proceed?
Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, I support the Bill.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): We are not  trying  to
stop you, hon member.

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: I have finished, Chairperson.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, may  I  express  appreciation  to  all
delegates  for  their  participation  in  this  debate.  To  deal  with   an
appropriation debate, as we have done here today,  is  clearly  a  difficult
process. It is difficult because the  process  is  flawed.  The  process  is
flawed because everybody operates under whip, and when  legislators  operate
by whip they sometimes do not see issues as they should see them. We owe  it
to ourselves and all our constituents to engage with the process so that  it
can be a lot more meaningful in future.

Some of the reasons that parties put forward for opposing or not  supporting
a particular Vote are in fact, reasons why they should support it.
Le me take the example of education. If one looks at the detail of  what  is
happening in the provinces, there is a lot more spending on  capital  works:
the building of classrooms; the provision of school books, laboratories  and
all manner of things in places where they previously did not exist; and  the
rollout of water, and electricity and all  of  those  things  that  are  now
coming into areas where television cameras do not go.

If there is anything that we should be celebrating,  it  is  the  fact  that
change is happening in those areas where previously  people  were  just  too
poor to recognise that change would come. It is happening, but  the  process
of transformation itself will always take  a  very  long  time.  And  if  we
understand that, then we must give applause where applause is due. But I  am
saying that in a party-political environment, it is sometimes  difficult  to
deal with issues in that way.

Once again, I thank hon members. My appeal is just that we  engage  in  this
process so that we can all see issues for what they  are,  disagree  on  the
same issues and give support to those hard-working public servants who  make
time and an  effort,  and  give  energy  in  order  to  get  into  areas  of
impoverishment. At the same time, we must collectively feel responsible  and
take issue with those who are too lazy to get to where the poor are.

We must not behave in the manner which we see on  TV,  which  often  focuses
only on what one does wrong. Now, my colleague the Minister  of  Safety  and
Security always says that  one  should  not  praise  a  fish  for  swimming,
because it is meant to swim. But in  dealing  with  a  complex  organisation
such as the Public Service, there are always going to be those who  will  be
out of order. And collectively, I think we have a  responsibility,  as  part
of our accountability to the electorate who sent us here, to  actually  deal
with those and support those who are bringing about changes in the lives  of
the poor.

Having said that, I thank all  members,  delegates  and  parties  for  their
support for this Appropriation Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                         REVENUE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

             (Consideration of Bill and of Report Bill thereon)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, I propose the adoption of this Bill.

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, The Revenue Laws Amendment  Bill  before  this
House represents a milestone in the history of tax reform in  this  country.
Clause 22 of the Bill makes provision for employees' tax payable in  respect
of directors of private companies. This is an unprecedented development.

The reasons for the  proposal  are  as  follows.  At  present  directors  of
private companies are not  subject  to  monthly  pay-as-you-earn,  or  PAYE,
deductions on their salaries or other remunerations. In the  past  this  has
been justified on the basis  of  the  practical  problems  that  arise  when
fixing a private  company  director's  final  remuneration  for  a  year  of
assessment and subjecting advances paid to directors to PAYE.

The result of this concession is that private company  directors  need  only
settle the tax bill on their salaries when they make their  provisional  tax
payments, and finally on assessment.

This gives private company directors a substantial cash-flow advantage  over
ordinary employees. In addition, public companies  have  devised  structures
to permit their directors to take advantage of this cash-flow advantage.

In order to create equity between  directors  and  ordinary  employees,  the
Revenue Laws Amendment Bill before us withdraws the exemption  from  payment
of PAYE that directors  of  private  companies  have  long  enjoyed.   These
private companies will, with effect from 1 March 2002, pay an amount of  tax
on behalf of  directors,  based  on  the  director's  remuneration  for  the
previous year of assessment as a form of a minimum amount.

Of course, cash-flow difficulties will  arise  where  the  final  amount  of
remuneration actually  paid  to  the  director  in  respect  of  a  year  of
assessment is well below the remuneration of the previous  year.  The  point
is, however, that the salaried director should not  be  placed  in  a  worse
position than a normal employee.

In addition, systems changes will be required  by  companies  to  administer
the payments of PAYE on amounts paid to  directors.  The  provision  in  the
Bill before this House will only apply with effect from 1 March 2002,  which
will give companies sufficient time to  introduce  changes  to  systems  and
register as employers for PAYE purposes.

A suggestion was also raised during the public  hearings  that,  perhaps,  a
system should be introduced whereby directors subject to PAYE may  elect  to
pay normal rates or a fixed percentage, for  example  40%,  instead  of  the
normal deduction tables.

The SA Revenue Service has argued that the introduction  of  such  a  system
will still result in a deferral benefit to  directors,  and  will  create  a
precedent which may lead to requests from  other  groups  of  employees  for
similar treatment.

My colleague and friend Mr Lucas will address this House on  incentives  for
strategic industries, but I would just like to make  an  additional  comment
on this subject.

An industrial project of a company is classified as a  strategic  industrial
project by the Minister of Trade and Industry after taking into account  the
recommendations of the adjudication committee, as provided for in the  Bill.
While it is likely that the industrial project will increase  production  of
the relevant industrial sector within  the  Republic,  displacement  of  any
other activities within  that  sector  could  occur.  Both  the  SA  Revenue
Service and the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  have  addressed  this
concern. Both the National Treasury and the SA Revenue Service  have  argued
that there can be no limited displacement of  domestic  industry.  Up  to  a
maximum of 40% of the project's output may  displace  existing  output.  For
example, if the domestic industry produces 100 000  units  of  a  particular
product and the new incentivised project produces 10 000 units, there  would
be no displacement if the total output of an industry increases to  110  000
units.

However, the new project is allowed to displace existing output by  no  more
than 40% of its output. Thus the total output after the project  is  up  and
running may fall to 106 000  units.  The  concern  of  the  displacement  of
activities by incentivised projects will be addressed by regulations  to  be
published in the Gazette at the right time. I think this is a call to  South
African companies to take  advantage  of  the  project  and  invest  in  the
country instead of choosing to go offshore.

A crucial and seldom-mentioned development in our administration of  tax  is
the notion of Siyakha, meaning ``we are building''. Siyakha is  one  of  the
most  dynamic  new  programmes  of  organisational  transformation  in   the
country. We believe it will set a new tone for the way that the  SA  Revenue
Service does its business. Through  Siyakha,  the  SA  Revenue  Service  has
taken the lead in transforming  their  organisation  into  one  that  prizes
efficiency above bureaucracy, customer relations above authoritarianism  and
assistance above blind obedience to tax regulations.

The SA Revenue Service will concentrate more on risk  management,  and  less
on administration. Its strengthened auditing  capacity  will  enable  it  to
give much better  services  to  traders  and  taxpayers  and  importers  and
exporters, while at the same time targeting noncompliance.

For the past five years Sars has consistently exceeded  revenue  targets  by
improving its collections and combating fraud.  It  is  a  record  that  has
allowed us to lower taxes, both at personal and corporate level, on a  year-
to-year basis. It is a path that we need to continue on.

Through Siyakha, Sars can contribute to the overall wellbeing of  the  South
African economy. Improved revenue collection and customs mean  that  we  can
increase social spending and cut taxes.

Siyakha,  as  a  transformation  process,  began  its  diagnostic  phase  in
February 2000. What  does  Siyakha  mean  for  the  country,  taxpayers  and
traders?

It means faster, more efficient processing of  returns  and  refunds  across
all tax types; a single point of registration for all tax  types;  dedicated
Sars taxpayer service centres designed to  solve  all  queries  quickly  and
efficiently and positioned to service all South Africans; simple tax  forms;
electronic filing for most businesses and taxpayers who file  through  third
parties;  closer  co-ordination   with   the   tax-filing   and   tax-paying
communities; more revenue collected and better social benefits.

What will Siyakha mean for Sars? It  will  mean  more  efficient  processes;
growth in stature as a revenue and customs organisation; optimising the  use
of  limited  resources;  the  establishment  of  a  transparent,  fair   and
consistent organisation that people  can  trust,  an  organisation  that  is
responsive to the needs  of  the  taxpayer;  and  pride  in  making  Sars  a
preferred employer.

What will Siyakha mean for  the  staff  of  Sars?  There  will  be  new  job
categories with a particular emphasis on  taxpayer  education  and  support;
new opportunities in audit, collections and data  analysis  to  support  our
move from administration to audit; new skills  and  training  programmes  to
develop them and identify their potential; and growth and  pride  in  a  new
work culture.

I hope that the other national departments  will  follow  Sars's  lead  when
they design their transformation programmes. Sars could  serve  as  a  model
for transforming every sector of government.

The ANC supports this Bill unequivocally. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, seeing that the Minister did not use  his  time,
can I have two minutes of his allocated time? [Laughter.]

Minister of Finance, Deputy Minister of Finance and hon colleagues ...

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, will the hon member take a question?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, will you take a question?

Dr E A CONROY: Not at this stage, Chairperson.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, if his taxes are paid up and he is  in
surplus with the Revenue Service, then he can  have  two  minutes.  If  not,
sorry. [Laughter.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I am up to date.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, carry on.

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, do I have the two minutes?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: No, hon member.

Dr E A CONROY: However well debated in the  draft  phase  and  however  well
functioning  in  its  finally  published  form  an  Act  may   be,   changed
circumstances, after a few years, will inevitably necessitate amendments  to
ensure that the relevant Act or Acts still serve their original purposes.

This Bill introduces amendments to a  variety  of  revenue-related  laws.  I
will mention only a few of the  more  important  ones  due  to  the  limited
speaking time allotted to me.

In the case of the Estate Duty Act of 1955, for  example,  the  value  of  a
property in an estate which consists of all  the  property  and  all  deemed
property of a person at the date of death is determined as provided  for  in
section 5.

Many circumstances have arisen where a value needs to be placed on  property
qualifying for  deductions  for  estate  duty  purposes  and,  although  the
evaluation rules have been applied for purposes of  both  the  inclusion  of
property in the estate and  the  deduction  thereof,  there  has  been  some
uncertainty in this regard. To eliminate any uncertainties  the  wording  of
section 5 is being amended  to  provide  that  the  value  of  the  property
determined in that section shall apply in respect of  property  included  in
the estate, as well as  for  purposes  of  the  deductions  contemplated  in
section 4 of the Act.

Proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act  of  1962  include  the  rates  of
normal tax payable by persons other than companies  as  well  as  companies;
pension funds and retirement funds of local  government  employees  a  small
technical amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill of 2001  as  far  as
capital gains tax is concerned; increases in  the  primary  rebate  and  the
rebate in respect of persons  over  65  years;  the  definition  of  foreign
dividends to protect the tax base; the deduction of the  full  cost  of  any
investment in manufacturing assets by a small  business  enterprise  in  the
year of assessment during which the asset is brought into use for the  first
time by that enterprise;  the  amendment  of  the  definition  of  the  word

A few amendments to the Stamp Duties Act of 1968, which I will not refer  to
in detail, have also become necessary.

To wrap up, a few amendments have also become ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time is up.

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, can I say that I support this Bill.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

Mr G A LUCAS:  Motlotlegi  Modulasetilo,  Ditona  tse  di  leng  teng  fano,
batlotlegi ba Ntlo eno ba ba leng teng fano ... [Hon Chairperson,  Ministers
present, and hon members who are here ...]

... the  Revenue  Laws  Amendment  Bill  before  this  House  represents  an
important milestone in advancing the cause of  small  business  development.
While there are consistent attempts to render  effective  support  to  small
businesses, none are as profound, far-reaching and  comprehensive  as  those
listed in the Revenue Laws Amendment Bill before this House.

Clause 12 of the Bill caters for  an  accelerated  depreciation  regime  for
qualifying small businesses that invest in manufacturing assets.

The full cost of investment may be deducted in the tax  year  in  which  the
asset is brought into use by a taxpayer for the first time.  The  clause  is
unambiguous in its intention to stimulate the cause of  the  small  business
sector. It clearly states that any plant or machinery of  a  taxpayer  which
qualifies as a small business shall qualify for a  deduction  equal  to  the
cost of such asset in the year in which such asset is brought into  use.  Of
course, we need to know the  following  qualifications.  The  clause  allows
exemption only when the asset is brought into use for the first time by  the
taxpayer on or after 1 April 2000, and is used by the taxpayer  directly  in
the process of manufacturing carried out by the taxpayer. [Interjections.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, on a point of order:  Is  it  parliamentary  for
another member to repeat my speech verbatim? [Laughter.]

Mr G A LUCAS: I am sure that that is not a question. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That will be looked into. [Laughter.]

Mr G A LUCAS: I am sure that Dr Conroy wants to move over to the ANC. So  it
is just an attempt to become more friendly to the ANC. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Great minds think alike. [Laughter.]

Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, this exemption also applies  to  any  expenditure
that is related to the transport cost of such assets. A taxpayer is  allowed
to deduct, from the taxpayer's income, the transport cost of new plants  and
machinery. This exemption does not apply to mining and farming. This  clause
will also improve the cash flow of  growing  small  businesses  and  further
enhance the potential for this sector to create the necessary jobs  required
in our country.

Last year, the Department of  Trade  and  Industry  announced  a  number  of
industrial incentives to facilitate investments in South Africa.  This  Bill
before us does expand  further  the  range  of  available  policy  tools  to
encourage investment by  introducing  investment  allowances  for  strategic
industrial projects.

This incentive will provide a  targeted  instrument  to  encourage  projects
that have significant direct and indirect  benefits  for  our  economy.  For
instance, a company is allowed to deduct an amount  equal  to  100%  of  the
cost of any industrial  asset  that  qualifies  as  a  strategic  industrial
project.

Projects eligible for 100% deductions  are  viewed  as  preferred  projects.
Some companies will also be allowed  to  deduct  50%  of  the  cost  of  any
industrial asset used  in  qualifying  industrial  projects.  The  companies
qualifying for this exemption have to be  taxpayers  in  good  standing  and
have to submit an application for approval of the project  to  the  Minister
of Trade and Industry after 31 July 2000 but not later than 31 July 2005.

In addition, during the public hearings questions  were  raised  as  to  the
appropriateness of instituting tax-based incentives  instead  of  cash-based
incentives  for  small-scale  business-sector   and   strategic   industrial
projects.

It is surprising that the critics of this Bill did not engage Government  to
explore the possibility of withdrawing the tax incentives  for  the  farming
and mining sectors which are already in receipt of tax-based incentives.

It is certain that businesses will prefer  cash-based  incentive  programmes
that have an immediate and direct impact on their cash flow. Government  has
decided on a tax-based incentive for the strategic industrial  projects  for
the following reasons: Firstly, the tax-based approach  will  contribute  to
ensuring  that  projects  receiving  the   benefit   are   sustainable   and
profitable. Secondly, tax-based  incentives  are  effective  for  profitable
firms, and additional allowances  will  provide  impetus  for  the  firm  to
undertake their  investment  as  quickly  as  possible  after  the  Minister
approves the project as strategic and to accelerate the production in  order
to  generate  sufficient  income  against  which  to  utilise  the  benefit.
Thirdly, the tax-based measure ensures  that  the  fiscus  stimulus  is  not
diluted; the deduction can only be used against  income  from  a  particular
project receiving the benefit. The tax  measure  will  have  a  more  direct
impact on strategic projects than tax-based  incentives  which  benefit  the
company irrespective of whether the project is  profitable  or  sustainable.
Lastly, the tax-based benefits are  less  susceptible  to  manipulation  and
fraud than cash-based incentives.

Based upon these remarks, the ANC supports the Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Chairperson, I am very much impressed to  see
the amount of detail that the distinguished members of  the  committee  have
given to the Bill. It is a complex piece of legislation. I  think  that  one
recognises that the changes this year are all on  the  production  side.  It
is, clearly, a very important commitment as part of  stimulating  growth  in
the economy. Having said that, of course, there is a degree by which we  act
in the environment of faith. But all of  this  was  well  reflected  by  the
three participants in the debate. It is clear that the Bill has the  support
of all parties in the House. I would like to thank all parties for that  and
the committee for their endeavours in discussing the Bill  in  the  kind  of
detail that they have.

Last  but  not  least,  in  expressing  appreciation,  may  I   wish   these
distinguished delegates well over this recess, but they should bear in  mind
that there is a lot of constituency work to do to explain what we have  done
in this House over the past six months. I wish them  well  over  the  period
and  invite  them  to  drive  safely.  I  also  appeal  to  them  to  return
invigorated after the recess. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

         ADMINISTRATION OF ESTATES LAWS INTERIM RATIONALISATION BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Order disposed of without debate.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                              FAREWELL MESSAGE

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  Before  I
conclude, may I take this opportunity to thank the hon the Minister and  his
Deputy for attending to these proceedings  and  engaging  this  House  in  a
lively debate.

Hon members, this is the  last  day  of  the  session,  but,  having  had  a
technical breakdown in the Chamber of the NCOP, I am not  promising  anybody
any party. Members are expected to resume  their  official  duties  from  20
August 2001. Maybe I should say a few  words  on  behalf  of  the  Presiding
Officers. We would like to extend our sincerest appreciation to hon  members
of this august House for the excellent work that they performed during  this
session. Almost all members who participated in the debates  of  this  House
acquitted themselves in a manner befitting public representatives.

We have noted with admiration a remarkable improvement  in  the  quality  of
the members' debates in this  House.  Furthermore,  we  noted  that  members
began to include matters of provincial importance in their speeches.

The gradual improvement in the participation of provincial  MECs  and  other
special delegates has added value to the quality of proceedings before  this
House. Therefore we appeal to members, and, in  particular,  the  Whips,  to
continue  ensuring  that  provinces  are  afforded  ample   opportunity   to
participate in the  business  of  this  House.  Sufficient  time  should  be
allocated to special delegates, and, in particular, MECs  and  premiers.  It
does not make sense to invite special delegates to the House and, when  they
do come, give them three or five minutes to speak. I would  like  to  appeal
to you to extend to them  our  thanks  and  appreciation  for  the  valuable
contribution that they have made.

Our special thanks also go to the Chief Whip, the Whips, the Chairperson  of
Committees and her deputy, and chairpersons of committees. We wish to  thank
all staff members, including staff at Regis House,  for  the  sterling  work
that they all  performed  during  this  session.  It  has,  indeed,  been  a
pleasure working with all of you and the staff.

Members are urged to  spend  the  few  days  that  have  been  allocated  as
holidays with their families. The rest of the  days  should  be  devoted  to
constituency work, as the people who brought  us  here  must  be  given  the
necessary attention and should not only be visited  when  we  require  their
votes.

Finally, the NCOP as a bastion of co-operative  governance  cannot  function
without the co-operation  of  all  stakeholders  in  general,  the  National
Assembly and the nine provinces in particular. Hon members, bon voyage.

The Council adjourned at 17:20.
