                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr B NAIR: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Sharks are playing against ACT Brumbies in the final
       of the Super 12;


  (2) further notes that it is the first time a South African side will be
       playing in the final of this tournament; and


  (3) wishes the team well and urges the Sharks to bring the cup home.

[Applause.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the decision of the ANC majority to force a debate on the
       allegations surrounding the position of the Speaker of the National
       Assembly and her role in relation to the investigation into the arms
       deal;


  (2) believes that the matter raises issues related to privilege, freedom
       of speech and the relationship between the Executive and Parliament;


  (3) remains convinced that these are complicated and fundamental issues
       that cannot be resolved in the course of the debate; and


  (4) therefore calls on the majority party and its allies, the IFP, to
       reconsider their position on this matter and to appoint an
       appropriate committee.

[Interjections.]

Mr P A C HENDRICKSE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the DA's imminent disintegration has been compounded by -


       (a)  little Ryan Coetzee's letter to Tony Leon to marginalise
           Marthinus van Schalkwyk;


       (b)  the tyrannical leadership of Peter Marais who wants to relocate
           informal traders without proper consultation;


       (c)  Gerald Morkel's lack of consultation on his proposed alliance
           with California;


       (d)  the inability to deal effectively with the untenable escalation
           of crime in Cape Town;


       (e)  the revelation of a plot to oust the over-ambitious Hennie
           Bester; and


       (f)  the fact that the DA is not really a party because the DP and
           the New NP still hold separate congresses; and


  (2) reminds the Disintegrating Alliance that the ANC warned that their
       marriage of convenience would end in tears.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mnr J DURAND: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)  drie regters van die Pretoriase Hooggeregshof se salaristjeks
           deur die bank geweier is; en


       (b)  verskeie provinsiale regters se salaristjeks verlede maand
           geweier is en dat regter Jimmy van Rensburg, waarnemende
           regterpresident van die Oos-Kaap, se salaristjek vir die tweede
           agtereenvolgende maand geweier is;


  (2) glo dit beklemtoon weer eens die ANC-regering se gebrek aan
       dienslewering aan alle Suid-Afrikaners; en


  (3) 'n dringende beroep doen op die ANC-regering om hulle prioriteite reg
       te kry en hulle eerder daarop toe te spits om dienslewering aan alle
       Suid-Afrikaners te verbeter, deur onder andere oorwerkte regters se
       salarisse te betaal, as om miljarde rande aan wapens en luukse
       vliegtuie vir die President te bestee.]
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J DURAND: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the salary cheques of three judges in the Pretoria Supreme
              Court have been dishonoured by the bank; and


       (b)  the salary cheques of several provincial judges were
              dishonoured last month and the salary cheque of Judge Jimmy
              van Rensburg, acting judge president of the Eastern Cape, was
              dishonoured for the second month in succession;


  (2) believes that this emphasises once more the ANC Government's lack of
       service delivery to all South Africans; and
  (3) urgently appeals to the ANC Government to get their priorities right
       and rather to concentrate on improving service delivery to all South
       Africans by, inter alia, paying the salaries of overworked judges,
       than to spend millions of rands on weapons and luxury aeroplanes for
       the President.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its delight at the latest figures released by Morgan
       Stanley Capital International, with South Africa surfacing as the
       biggest gainer among emerging markets;


  (2) notes that Morgan Stanley Capital International is the world's
       leading compiler of share indices for investors, and that their
       positive rating will have a marked effect on short-term foreign
       investment in South Africa;


  (3) urges the Government to consolidate these gains, ensuring longer-term
       foreign investment by firmly and unambiguously addressing corruption,
       HIV/Aids and regional foreign policy; and


  (4) calls on the Government to make full use of current downward
       inflationary pressures by reducing the price of fuel as a matter of
       urgency, to ensure that ordinary South Africans are the ultimate
       beneficiaries.

Ms P K MOTHOAGAE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) recognises that molestation of pupils by school teachers is a gross
       violation of the rights of pupils;


  (2) welcomes the statement by the Director-General of Education that
       principals who cover up such activities will be disciplined;
  (3) urges members of the House to assist in exposing such practices; and


  (4) believes that such molestation is extremely detrimental to the
       development of young people and that more needs to be done to equip
       our school system to protect, nurture and provide a safe environment
       for our young people.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the PAC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that President Joseph Kabila has unbanned political parties in
       the Democratic Republic of Congo;


  (2) further notes that the announcement to unban all political parties
       was made at the ceremony held to mark the anniversary of the fall of
       the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko on 17 May 1999; and


  (3) hails this move as a correct signal for creating a conducive climate
       to bring democracy and political stability in the DRC.

Dr C P MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  van die sinlose moord op die 18-jarige Ashley Kempen, 'n
           matriekleerling van die HoÃ«r Jongenskool Paarl, by sy ouers se
           vulstasie in Klapmuts;


       (b)  dat hy op 'n kort afstand ses keer met 'n 9-mm pistool geskiet
           is tydens 'n gewapende roof by sy ouers se vulstasie; en


       (c)  dat hy vermoor is deur die 23-jarige Eric Skefile, 'n swart man
           wat tot onlangs by die vulstasie van die Kempens werksaam was,
           en twee trawante;


  (2) sy opregte meegevoel uitspreek met Ashley se ouers, mnr en mev Shane
       Kempen van Klapmuts; en


  (3) 'n dringende beroep doen op die ANC-regering op nasionale vlak, maar
       veral op die DA-regering op provinsiale vlak om misdadigers soos Eric
       Skefile in die Wes-Kaap sonder genade te hanteer en hom permanent te
       verwyder uit die samelewing.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the senseless murder of 18-year-old Ashley Kempen, a matric
           pupil at Paarl Boys' High School, at his parents' petrol station
           in Klapmuts;
       (b)  that he was shot six times at close range with a 9 mm pistol
           during an armed robbery at his parents' petrol station; and


       (c)  that he was murdered by 23-year-old Eric Skefile, a black man
           who was until recently employed at the Kempens' petrol station,
           and two henchmen;


  (2) expresses it sincere condolences to Ashley's parents, Mr and Mrs
       Shane Kempen of Klapmuts; and


  (3) makes an urgent appeal to the ANC Government at national level, but
       particularly to the DA government at  provincial level, to treat
       criminals like Eric Skefile without mercy in the Western Cape and to
       remove him permanently from society.]

Mr J H MOMBERG: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock and dismay the special International Cricket Council
       Report on corruption in the game of cricket;


  (2) recognises that persistent reports on corruption in cricket tarnish
       the image of the game as a gentlemanly sport;


  (3) condemns corruption in cricket;


  (4) commends cricket authorities for their efforts in eradicating the
       scourge of corruption in this game;


  (5) urges all national cricket bodies to study and implement the
       anticorruption recommendations of the International Cricket Council
       Report; and


  (6) calls on the United Cricket Board to ensure that anticorruption
       measures are in place for the 2003 Cricket World Cup to be held in
       South Africa.

Ms J A SEMPLE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Ekurhuleni mayor has bowed to DA pressure by back-
       tracking on the decision to spend R500Â 000 on an armoured vehicle;


  (2) recognises the valuable role played by a strong, principled
       opposition and a free media;


  (3) further notes -


       (a)  allegations that the ANC chief whip in the metro is paid as a
           full-time councillor when she should be paid as a part-time
           councillor and that she has the use of council transport and
           drivers on top of receiving a travelling allowance;


       (b)  that the mayor spent over R30 000 of council money on tickets
           for the Lewis vs Rahman fight to give to his mayoral committee
           and other ANC hacks; and


       (c)  that between R400 000 and R500 000 was spent on radio
           advertisements promoting the fight and the mayor himself; and


  (4) therefore calls on the ANC to put the interests of the residents of
       Ekurhuleni first by getting their snouts out of the trough, and
       spending ratepayers' money on the upliftment of the poor.

Mr P A C HENDRICKSE: Chairperson, on a point of order.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Who is raising the point of order?

Mr P A C HENDRICKSE: Here at the back, Chairperson.

The CHAIRPERSON: Point of order granted.

Mr P A C HENDRICKSE: Chairperson, the hon member just said ``getting their
snouts out of the trough''. A pig has a snout, and I think that the member
is implying that members of the ANC are pigs, which I do not think is
parliamentary.

The CHAIRPERSON: Order! I will have to look at the motion again, hon
member, and then we will give a ruling on that. [Interjections.] Order! If
it is out of order, it will not be printed in the motion. However, we will
have to check on that.

Mr M F CASSIM: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that rail usage in South Africa is unfortunately limited to the
       poor and to daily commuters using the Metro service;


  (2) believes that all segments of our country should use rail for it to
       grow and modernise;


  (3) notes the introduction of the Premier Class facility that offers
       unique opportunities for conferences, parties, family get-togethers
       and that the uses to which it could be put are limitless;


  (4) notes that the Blue Train is an experience that is unique in our
       country and in the world;


  (5) wishes to encourage banks, financial institutions and all other
       enterprises offering prizes to consider a journey for two on the Blue
       Train, for this would be a win-win situation; and


  (6) notes that the IFP calls on the House and on all South Africans to
       put rail in their travel and holiday plans because greater use of
       rail would be environmentally friendly and economically important for
       South Africa.

Ms S K MNUMZANA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that 500 striking Engen workers marched to Wentworth Police
       Station and damaged property as scuffles between police and the
       workers broke out;


  (2) believes that workers have a right to strike but within the
       parameters and regulations set out by the labour relations laws of
       the country;


  (3) condemns the destruction of property; and


  (4) calls on all South Africans to respect the law enforcement officers
       and agencies of our country and to utilise the available instruments
       of recourse in cases of misuse of power or violation of
       constitutional rights.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with appreciation that South Africa's High Commissioner in
       Zimbabwe, Mr Jeremiah Ndou, for the first time publicly expressed his
       concern over the invasion of especially white-owned businesses in
       Zimbabwe;


  (2) endorses his statement that South Africa cannot accept a perceived
       signal that foreign investment might not be protected in the region;
       and


  (3) calls on the hon President of South Africa to be equally vociferous
       in his condemnation of what is currently happening in Zimbabwe.

Mr C T FROLICK: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  according to a study by the SA Roads Policy Project, failure to
           upgrade South African's ailing road system has already cost the
           country between R100 billion and R150 billion in capital assets
           and the figure is rising;


       (b)  failure by the Government to address this issue has led to a
           backlog, which will cost R15,2 billion a year for 10 years to
           correct the accumulated deterioration in the existing network;


       (c)  at present only 60% of this figure is being spent; and


       (d)  the UDM urgently calls on the Government to effectively and
           urgently deal with the state of our national roads, without
           which efficient delivery on housing, schools and clinic
           projects, will be crippled.

Mnu M U KALAKO: Mhlali-ngaphambili, ndenza isaziso sokuba xa ihlala iNdlu
kwakhona ndiya kwenza isiphakamiso egameni le-ANC:


  Sokuba le Ndlu -


  (1) iqaphele intsindabadala yodushe oluthe gqolo ukuqhubeka kumazwe
       akuMbindi-Mpuma;


  (2) ivakalise udano lwayo kwiNkulumbuso yakwaSirayeli nebithembise
       ngokumisa uhlaselo kodwa lube lusaqhuba; nokuba


  (3) ikhuthaze onke amaqela achaphazelekayo kule mbambano ukuba abuyele
       kwitafile yeengxoxo zoxolo; nokuba


  (4) imemelele kwihlabathi jikelele ukuba lincedisane noku linike uncedo
       lobuntu kumaxhoba olu dushe ngokukhawuleza okudibene nokungxama.
(Translation of Xhosa notice of motion follows.)

[Mr M U KALAKO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that at the next
sitting day of the House, I will move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the continuing crisis in countries in the Middle East;


  (2) expresses its disappointment at the Prime Minister of Israel, who had
       promised to stop attacks but they are still continuing;
  (3) encourages all the parties involved in this crisis to negotiate
       peace; and


  (4) calls on the entire world to assist in this process and give help to
       the victims as soon as possible.]

       with building a prosperous, peaceful Africa where the democratic
       practices of all its nations further the aspirations of and
       opportunities for all African people, an Africa which plays a leading
       role in international affairs; and


  (3) commits itself to serving our African continent in pursuit of these
       goals.

Agreed to.

                      GOOD WISHES TO SHARKS RUGBY TEAM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr C H F GREYLING: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) wishes the Sharks success in their Super 12 final clash against the
       ACT Brumbies in Australia tomorrow; and

                             APPROPRIATION BILL
Debate on Vote No 13 - Arts, Culture, Science and Technology:

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson,
colleagues, comrades, ladies and gentlemen, I find the budget speech
preparation process to be a very effective mechanism for Ministers to take
stock of the progress that they have made as far as their Ministry's
challenges are concerned. I believe that this year we have begun to see
something of a breakthrough in the work of the Ministry of Arts, Culture,
Science and Technology.

Allow me to explain. When I took up the position of Minister of Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology in 1994, a great deal of my time and energy
was spent on trying to persuade South Africans and many of my colleagues in
Government of the importance of arts and culture in the economy, in nation-
building and in the imaging of South Africa. I spent almost as much time
making a case for research and development, and technology transfer as key
levers of economic development.

Much of our time was spent on proving that the cultural industries were an
important economic sector with the potential to create jobs and to
stimulate rural economies; that science and technology were vital
components of ensuring global competitiveness and improving the quality of
life of all South Africans; and that our culture, our heritage and our
sciences were key to unleashing our imaginations and our creative
potential.

Much of our work over the past five years has been on integrating culture
and science into the core economic and social development programmes of
national Government. I believe that there has been a breakthrough in the
national acceptance of the importance of arts, culture, science and
technology as central to achieving the economic and social development
imperatives of this Government.

In January this year the cultural industries were included as one of the
key growth sectors within Cabinet's economic and employment cluster.
Technology, along with infrastructure and human resource development, was
declared as one of the three key crosscutting imperatives for economic
development.

By the end of June we will have developed a national strategy on
biotechnology as a result of a direct mandate from Cabinet. South African
music, film, theatre and visual arts are being used with great success to
showcase and promote our country in Britain this month, as part of the
Celebrate South Africa programme. In these and in a number of other ways,
technology, science, culture and arts have finally been placed firmly on
the national agenda as having a central role to play in achieving our core
national objectives.

I will now dwell on some highlights, beginning with science and technology.
The role of science and technology in contributing to national growth is
now broadly accepted, not just here at home but internationally. Science
and technology are now recognised as major contributors to industrial
productivity, economic growth, environmental sustainability and
international competitiveness. The role of science and technology in South
Africa has become increasingly important over the past decade.

Globalisation is a reality that brings with it a number of significant
challenges for developing nations. The full benefits of global scientific
advances over 200 years of scientific progress and industrial growth are
enjoyed only by no more than one fifth of the world's population. As
markets are increasingly globalised, the barriers to entering certain
technological areas and becoming globally competitive are growing; and the
costs of licence technology, that is, the technology trade deficit, are
growing.

As we have seen with the recent legal wranglings with pharmaceutical
companies, access to biotechnology, in particular, is a major international
issue that is redefining power relationships between the South and the
North. It is widely accepted that successful nations will increasingly be
those with high levels of technological innovations.

As members of Parliament will be aware, the National Research and
Technology Foresight Study launched in March last year provided a
structured opportunity to look ahead and consider the role that may be
required of science and technology in the future of our economy. Since the
launch of the foresight study, we have been involved in the drive to
develop a technology foresight culture within the country. The foresight
study provided South Africa with glimpses of what technological futures
will exist, and what can be expected in terms of emerging technologies over
the next 10 to 20 year period in the 12 sectors covered by the study.

These openings into the future now require a detailed mapping out of the
landscape through a structured and planned exercise, the output of which
will be a set of technology road maps. Technology road maps will be
developed in the following three sectors which have been identified by the
foresight study as having the highest potential for economic growth and
development. These are information and communication technologies, advanced
materials, and bio informatics and biotechnology.

In all three of these sectors, we will be looking at what technological
resources need to be developed in order to maximise current and future
market opportunities. The underlying purpose of the exercise is
strategically to position South Africa in the technology driven global
economy. It is expected that all technology road maps will have been
finalised by the end of this year.

The application of biotechnology has enjoyed significant influence in the
transformation of the agricultural, health and other sectors globally, as
well as in South Africa. People around the world continue to benefit from
the way in which biotechnology has transformed and advanced all these
sectors.

As a Government we need to manage the development of biotechnology to
ensure that any risks are minimised, and that positive socioeconomic
impacts are maximised. To this end, we are engaged in the development of a
national biotechnology strategy. The strategic study will outline current
biotechnology trends in South Africa and map the way forward with respect
to legislation, practices, research and technology development and
utilisation, funding sources to promote biotechnology research and
development, private sector and state support to sector growth and skills
development.

In addition, the study will highlight areas of uncertainty, knowledge gaps
and varying perspectives about the impact, effects of and benefits from
biotechnology developments and applications. On the basis of this
information, a national strategy on biotechnology will be developed.

The second key area of focus for us is information technology. A number of
Government departments are focusing on this important area, including the
Department of Trade and Industry, the Department of Communications, and the
Department of the Public Service and Administration.

Two things have become clear with regard to Government's approach to
information technology. Firstly, there is a need for a vast increase in the
amount of research and development that is being conducted in this sector.
A recent study completed by my department shows that total expenditure on
research and development in South Africa is only about 0,7% of gross
domestic product, which is between a half and a quarter of what it should
be.

Of this, some studies estimate, less than 5% goes into information and
communication technology research. Clearly, there is room for improvement.
We will continue to engage with the national Treasury to find ways of
allocating more Government funds for IT research and research in general.
In addition, information technology research is high on our list of
priorities for collaborative research with our international partners.

The second issue is the need for increased co-ordination between various
Government departments dealing with information technology, so as to
minimise duplication and increase efficiency. We believe that it is part of
our responsibility to co-ordinate the various Government IT initiatives and
to maintain a national overview with regard to progress being made in the
development of the IT sector. We will be attending to this in the months to
come.

In the important area of technology diffusion, the Technology Stations
Pilot Programme was launched by the department long-term vision of setting
up technology stations in technikons, which will function as self-
sustainable entities that can provide technology solutions to small and
medium enterprises. It is hoped that the development of these technology
stations will encourage a culture of innovation among small businesses that
will, in turn, improve product development and manufacturing productivity
and, of course, create more jobs. Technology stations have already been set
up at four technikons, and there are plans to expand the programme.

Under the leadership of the National Research Foundation, the construction
of the SA Large Telescope, known as Salt, at Sutherland is well under way,
with funding from a range of international partners now secured. We have
identified astronomy and space science as key opportunities for South
African basic science. To this end, we have accepted the donation of a R50
million Satellite Laser Ranging System from Nasa, and we are consolidating
the Magnetic Observatory at Hermanus into our system of national
facilities. The High Energy Stereoscopic System, a gamma ray observatory
being constructed in Namibia with German, South African and French
expertise, demonstrates our commitment to promoting leading-edge scientific
development across the SADC region.

Another key facility which has come on line since my last budget speech is
the National Laser Centre. The National Laser Centre is a classic success
story of transforming a competence developed previously in the nuclear
energy field into one that now serves high tech industry. It really proves
that one can turn swords into ploughs. I would like to take this
opportunity to wish the new director of the National Laser Centre, Dr
Philemon Mjwara, the best of luck.

Late last year, a hitherto unknown population of coelacanths was discovered
off Sowdana Bay in northern KwaZulu-Natal. We are currently setting up a
project under the National Research Foundation to investigate this
significant discovery further. New techniques of gene sequencing make the
study of this living fossil even more fascinating. The key question here is
how the genetic makeup of the fish remained so stable over hundreds of
millions of years. I believe this also further proves that South Africa and
Africa are the birthplace of all life.

I would now like to move on to the Arts and Culture part of my portfolio.
The lekgotla of Cabinet's economic and employment cluster took place in
January this year. At this lekgotla a number of priority areas were mapped
out for the maximisation of the capacity of cultural industries to
contribute to economic development and employment. This is really the
culmination of the recommendations made in the cultural industry's growth
strategy that was initiated by my department in 1997. My colleague Mrs
Mabandla will provide the House with the specific details on this matter.

We are now giving serious attention to the major challenges relating to the
archives and records function. An efficient archival service operating at
both national and provincial level is one of the most important systems
available for addressing issues of good governance and public
accountability, and for identifying and preserving the resources necessary
for correcting the distortions and imbalances in the way in which the
history of our country has been presented in the past. To this end, we have
successfully completed a pilot Oral History Project that was linked with
the development of the Women's Monument at the Union Buildings. A full-
scale national oral history project is now being developed.

One of the biggest challenges we face is the need to fulfil the
constitutional mandate to devolve certain archival functions to the
provinces. Progress has been made in this area, but there are a number of
challenges facing us. In a number of the provinces, for instance, there are
no institutions to which one can devolve this function.

In order to keep up with the rapidly changing technological environment,
the National Archives has produced a set of guidelines for the management
of electronic records in government agencies. The archives are working very
closely with the State Information Technology Agency - Sita. The National
Automated Archival Information Retrieval System includes a new website
through which academic researchers, school children and interested persons
from whatever background can obtain guidance on the availability of
archival information. This is a big step forward in our policy of taking
archives to people.

Language impacts profoundly on all aspects of national life in South Africa
and on the ability of Government to provide equitable access to services
and programmes. Language is also an empowering tool for all our people to
participate in politics and the economy, and to converse about their own
lives in their own situation.

The Draft Language Policy and Plan for South Africa, which is a product of
a protracted consultative process with Government departments, civil
society and other role-players, is currently being finalised. The language
policy is intended as an enabling framework for promoting South Africa's
linguistic diversity. The purpose of this policy is to set out a coherent
language policy and implementation plan for a multilingual dispensation
within the parameters of the Constitution and in concert with broad social
planning and transformation in South Africa. The language plan will develop
and promote the official African languages.

I have described the impact of our programmes in relevant sectors in South
Africa in some detail. Our external programmes are, in many ways,
complemented by our internal focus on transforming the department. I
believe we have made great strides in this respect. Currently, 67% of the
department's top management is made up of black managers, and 23% of top
management are black women. Of our total staff complement below the levels
of top management, 59% are black. We believe that this greater
representivity in the make-up of our department is a central factor in the
progress we have made in the past few years.

In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my statement that we are seeing a
breakthrough in the use of science, technology, arts and culture as tools
in achieving our national objectives. I hope that my colleagues in other
Government departments will continue to work with us in ensuring that we
maximise the potential of these important sectors. After all, science and
technology is a transversal and crosscutting entity. [Applause.]

Prof I J MOHAMED: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister and hon
members, it is a pleasure for me to support, on behalf of the ANC, the Vote
of the Department of Arts, Culture Science and Technology - Dacst.

In the 1999 Vote debate I reviewed the transformation of the department
over the five-year period from 1994 to 1999. We need to examine what has
happened since then and where we are headed in the medium term.

Before the ANC came to power in 1994, there was no dedicated department of
arts, culture, science and technology. We must congratulate Dacst on the
excellent work it has done in building this department.

I recall briefly my assessment in 1999 to set the context of my
presentation. Firstly, the Dacst Vote as a percentage of the national
budget increased steadily from 1994 to 1999. The share of science and
technology of the Dacst Vote increased significantly over this period.
Secondly, the allocation to the eight science councils and the four
national facilities, amongst which are the National Accelerator Centre and
the SA Astronomical Observatory, also increased in real terms.

Thirdly, the department put various programmes and structures in place to
promote science and technology. Amongst these are the National Advisory
Council on Innovation - Naci, the Foresight Study, the Innovation Fund and
the Public Understanding of Science and Technology. It also appointed
review panels to assess the performance and programmes of the science
councils and of the national facilities.

The Naci advises the Minister on cutting-edge technology to help us to
compete in the technology-driven global market. The Innovation Fund
supports, on a competitive basis, innovative technologies to help drive our
economic growth and transformation. The Foresight Study aims to identify
major future technologies so that we can carve niche markets in a fiercely
competitive global economy.

The Public Understanding of Science and Technology popularises this area
and tries to bring the youth, and particularly the marginalised groups,
girls and women on board, thus increasing the pool of future scientists. I
may mention in particular that camps for young girls have been set up to
introduce them or to stimulate their interest in science and technology,
particularly as we know that girls are sidelined in our school system.

My conclusion was that Dacst had admirably succeeded in bringing about a
major transformation in the science and technology terrain. This work has
continued and grown apace during the past two years.

I now turn to the period 2001-02 and expenditure in the medium term. The
Dacst Vote increased by 13,7% this year, and is estimated to increase by
8,7% next year and 7,7% in 2003. The share of the science and technology
allocation as a percentage of the Dacst Vote is 59,9% and stabilises near
this figure in the next two years. This confirms the relative importance
attached to science and technology, and particularly as the Minister has
said that he thinks he has won the case in the Cabinet and the population
at large regarding understanding the importance of science and technology.
I hope that is so, and these figures do confirm that.

The department, in accordance with recommendations by Naci to the Minister,
distributes a pool of money called the science vote to the science
councils, the national facilities, the National Research Foundation and
other science programmes and organisations. The science vote increased from
approximately R598 million in 1997 to R1,012 billion in 2001, which is an
increase of 59,1%. The estimated increase for 2002 is 8,6%, and for 2003,
6,2%.

There are several new programmes and institutions, but I will mention only
two - the Minister has also mentioned these - the Laser Trust created from
the laser collection of the Atomic Energy Corporation when its Molecular
Laser Isotope Separation uranium enrichment plant was shut down and the
Indigenous Knowledge System. The first provides lasers for technological
industries, and the second explores ways and means to preserve, build and
protect the rich indigenous knowledge and to bring it into the mainstream
of science and technology. The department organised study tours to India
and China, in which the portfolio committee participated, to study their
rich experience in this area.

The department has also signed various international agreements which will
be of benefit to our country and that of our partners. The SA Large
Telescope, which the Minister has also mentioned, and which is now under
construction in Sutherland, is an example. It will be used to study
galaxies thousands of light years beyond our own galaxy - the milky way.

I have mentioned two areas of concern. Firstly, the investment by the
private sector in research and development as a percentage of gross
domestic product is falling. This will retard our scientific and
technological development. It is clear that to encourage funding in
research and development by the industry, Government must increase
investment even further in research and development, so as to signal its
confidence in our scientific and technological system and economy.

Secondly, the Dacst review panel of the Atomic Energy Corporation said that
the Safari nuclear reactor was a serious drain on state funds. It
recommended that an independent inquiry investigate the desirability of
continuing with the Safari reactor. We in minerals and energy learned the
other day in an answer to a question I put to the Nuclear Energy
Corporation of South Africa, Necsa, that there was a subsequent review
which declared Safari a national facility, and this was accepted by
Cabinet.
It is very disappointing that we should unearth this in response from the
Department of Minerals and Energy - DME - to our questions to Necsa.
Surely, Dacst and DME, since they are serving in the same economic cluster,
would have discussed this and should have disclosed it to their respective
portfolio committees.

Finally, I put it to the National Nuclear Regulator - NNR - that there is
talk that radio active material was stolen from Necsa. Because of time
constraints, the question could not be answered at the portfolio committee
meeting. The NNR official who was making the presentation confirmed to me
after the meeting that a truck or vehicle carrying radioactive material was
either hijacked or stolen. Neither Dacst nor DME informed their respective
portfolio committees about this. I am mentioning Dacst simply because it
serves in the same economic cluster as DME.

Eskom has set up a feasibility and environmental impact study of the Pebble
Bed Modular Reactor. If we handle the incident I mentioned in this way, we
must not be surprised at the public distrust of those propagating nuclear
energy as a source of energy and stiffer opposition to the Pebble Bed
Modular Reactor and nuclear energy in general.
It is a pity that I must address these issues here, but they warrant urgent
consideration. I trust that this incident will soon be put behind us and we
will go forward with the task at hand.

I congratulate the Minister and his department on their budget. [Applause.]


Mr V C GORE: Chairperson, hon Minister and members of this House, before I
begin I would like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment as the
Chairperson of the executive committee of the Commonwealth Science Council.
We wish him well in this very important position.

Today's debate, in my view, is about three things, firstly, the importance
of science and technology as an ultimate tool in the delivery to the people
of South Africa, secondly, the ANC Government's track record, and their
shortcomings and failures in this regard, and, thirdly, what the DA can and
will do, in other words, the DA's plan of action to get science and
technology working for the citizens of South Africa.

The starting point of this debate must surely be the importance of science
and technology to deliver to South Africa. I do not think that many members
of this House realise the importance of technology and what role it can
play in our lives. It is because of this short-sightedness of members of
the ruling party that many of our social ills have yet to be solved.

A shocking example of this is the senseless deaths of pensioners in
Government's pension payout queues. I wish the hon Minister of Social
Development were listening, because these deaths would clearly be
avoidable, if only the Department of Social Development effectively
implemented a successful technology strategy.

Corruption in the Public Service is another example. If the ANC were as
serious about stamping out corruption as they claim to be, then the hon
Minister for the Public Service and Administration would have concentrated,
from the start, on implementing a successful technology strategy.

In terms of crime, instead of making arms deals which benefit the
privileged few, some of whom may well be hon members of this House, the
Minister of Safety and Security should be investing in technology that
keeps the streets of South Africa safe. Cape Town, which falls under the DA
provincial government, has successfully installed closed-circuit cameras
which have proved effective in reducing crime in the CBD. If the hon
Minister had any commitment to eradicate crime, then he would realise that
he needs to implement a successful technology strategy.

Each example could have been resolved had a successful technology strategy
been implemented, and that is where the ANC Cabinet has failed, some may
argue, to the extent of criminal negligence, which is certainly the case in
terms of the pension payouts.

Science and technology must be viewed as a building block for economic
development, education and ultimately service delivery. It is therefore
crucial that any policy direction should be a unified one which
incorporates both the educational and economic aspects.

Unfortunately, this is not the case at present. The ANC Government has
failed to achieve an acceptable level of co-ordination between the
Departments of Education, of Trade and Industry and of Arts, Culture,
Science and Technology, in effectively implementing the priorities as set
out in the science and technology White Paper.

This inability to establish a technology power base will be detrimental to
our pursuit of a knowledge-based economy. The concept of a one-stop shop is
definitely required in the drafting and implementation of any policy or
legislation affecting science and technology.

Regarding technology and its impact on the economy, the bottom line is that
if we can get the economy working, then we will get South Africa working on
a social level as well. It is therefore necessary to remind ourselves that
the state does not and cannot create wealth. The state - I hope the ANC is
paying attention - must, because of this fact, create an enabling
environment. Moreover, this is one of the major pitfalls of the ANC
administration. Despite the noteworthy attempts by hon Minister Ngubane,
the required enabling environment has not been created.

The ANC are to be applauded for creating a department of science and
technology. However, this step becomes nothing more than another link in
the bureaucratic chain if the department is not utilised effectively. The
National Advisory Council on Innovation was another good idea in theory. In
practice, however, the council has failed to become a source of inspiration
for innovation, mainly due to its highly bureaucratic approach and
insufficient support mechanisms.

Another example of the hon Minister's good intentions paving the road to
poverty is the funding priorities of organisations which his department
supports, such as the IDC. Successful international trends clearly show
that there needs to be a shift away from supporting big business to a more
aggressive focus on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises.

In this regard, we hope and pray that the CSIR's Brain and Macs will
deliver and stimulate SMME creation. Clearly, these examples all boil down
to one thing: The ANC has failed to create a nurturing and enabling
environment for the development and promotion of science and technology.

The impact of this shortcoming is significant as technology is required to
assist privatisation, which ultimately would lead to capital flowing into
our economy. Foreign investors need guarantees that their investment is
sustainable. A state-owned company that is unable to compete in a
technology-based market is therefore at risk and has less potential for
sustainable business.

The results of this are that, firstly, it slows down the much-needed
privatisation process, secondly, we might not attract the best possible
investors, and finally, problems which could otherwise be avoided could
arise out of the privatisation process. However, this is not the most
important problem facing us. In fact, a far more challenging problem is
that we are a low-skills, high-wage-based economy. For the benefit of hon
members of the ruling party who do not understand why this is a serious
problem, allow me to expand.

If a car-manufacturing company had two plants, one in South Africa and one
in Singapore, and has invested highly in a skills-based economy, in a case
in which this company needs to adapt or retrench workers, it would
certainly adapt its operation in the Asian country as skilled workers are
more adaptable, and choose to retrench workers in South Africa, as not only
are we generally a less skills-based economy, but also our labour is
competitively overpriced. What this means is that in order to improve our
economy we need to build a knowledge-based economy, in which workers are
highly skilled and our cost of labour competitively priced.

The ANC has failed in this regard. Cosatu rules the roost when it comes to
wages, much to the detriment of workers and South Africa at large, whilst
the ANC has as yet been unable to effectively implement a strategy which
sees an increase in our skills base, particularly in the area of science
and technology.

Having said that we need to turn our attention to science and technology as
it relates to education. The statistics with regard to matric education
reflect a very poor state of affairs. The proportion of South African
university degrees in maths and science has also seen an overall decline,
despite improvements on the figures from the early 1990s. It is obvious
that there are no short-term solutions and that we need to be in this
process for the long haul. However, it is not acceptable to simply sit back
with an attitude of riding out the storm. We need to take positive, bold
and proactive steps to rectify the situation, and we need to take these
steps now.

This is what we propose: We need to develop strategies to retain the
current skills base; we need to take the threat of the current brain drain
seriously; we need to ensure that our immigration policies attract skilled
people in the areas where they are lacking; and we need to train more and
more doctors, engineers and scientists, and create an environment in which
they feel safe to wake up in the morning and travel to work to do an honest
day's work and then go back home, confident in the knowledge that their
family members have not been hijacked, raped, assaulted or murdered.
[Interjections.]

This is how we create a better life for all, that is by providing a helping
hand, not a handout. We cannot and must not underestimate the value of
investing in technology. We must take the lead from countries such as the
UK whose contribution to science and technology has increased by about 20%
over the past few years, and the Canadian government which has pledged to
double its contribution over the next two years.

In conclusion, the only viable solution to poverty alleviation in South
Africa is through wealth generation. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

[Mrs T J TSHIVHASE: Chairperson, if we look at the changes, inasfar as arts
and culture are concerned, for many years the department has tried to
dismantle the apartheid exclusions and bring forth the skills and cultural
heritage suppressed and hidden for centuries by the colonialists.

The vision of the ANC-led Government is to give expression to positive
thoughts, and to improve the quality of life of the people of this country,
in particular those who have suffered the burden of apartheid exclusion.
This could be done by uncovering the traditional skills, creativity,
products and unique diversity of Africa, while maintaining South Africa's
diversity.

In this year's state of the nation address, President Thabo Mbeki stated
that we must, and will, ensure that wars, disease and underdevelopment are
no longer seen as being synonymous with Africans. The other important
challenge is the achievement of an international consensus on a humane,
just and equitable world order.]

The President further stated, and I quote:


  ... African child should ever again walk in fear of guns, tyrants and
  abuse; that no African child should ever again experience hunger,
  avoidable disease and ignorance; that no African child should ever again
  feel ashamed to be an African.

[All these challenges are central to the present agenda of African unity.
The essence of African unity is, therefore, that it is incumbent upon all
African countries to get together as a unified force, to take action to try
to address challenges confronting us. We, as the ANC, understand our
Government is trying to develop African unity, which must be taken into
consideration.

The starting point in this regard is that South Africa is an African
country. President Thabo Mbeki correctly observed that a better Africa and
a better world are genuinely in the interest of South Africa's people.
Our role in enhancing African unity is located within the African
Renaissance and other processes related to it. It is about the political,
economic, social and cultural rebirth of the African continent.

It is important that South Africa is playing an important role in
developing this continent. We must also encourage South African
businesspeople to go and invest in other African countries.

We must have the same vision about the future. In the last seven years, the
department has tried to dismantle, slowly but surely, the relics of
apartheid, and has tried to ensure that the delicate balance between
privilege and unique heritage is maintained.

This budget reflects a steady growth in the allocations to arts and culture
during the years 2000-2004. This reflects the seriousness with which arts
and culture are regarded by the ANC. We support this budget.]

It is in this context that the establishment of the Commission for the
Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and
Linguistic Communities becomes relevant. We must intensify our efforts to
enhance African unity. Africa's time has come! Africa must unite for
change!

[We, as the ANC, can see that this Government has played a huge role in
bringing about change inasfar as arts and culture are concerned, because we
feel that now we are true South Africans. We no longer feel despised, we
wear our own clothes and speak our languages as we wish. These are enormous
steps taken by the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology.

We are proud to be Africans, because being an African is to be someone
different from others. We are not looking at race, but the development of
our country, which is now being taken into consideration. We are proud and
we support our budget.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Mr Chairperson, colleagues, one day all too soon,
humankind's most cherished dream will be realised. At that precise moment,
humankind will simultaneously be seized by its greatest terror. If contact
with alien life is to be made, then the time for that cannot be all that
far away. Therefore, even as we are seized by considerations of
globalisation, we must also start lifting our eyes to cosmic challenges and
opportunities.

As we leave our cosmic childhood behind, we will need to conquer new
frontiers, and science and technology will define those frontiers. We have
so much catching up to do and so many negative legacies to erase. We simply
have to go along a vertical trajectory. The policy tool for taking us
forward is the National System of Innovation.

Table 13.9 shows that in 1997-98, R22,299 million was spent on science,
technology and knowledge system development and maintenance. In 2000-01
this figure had shot up to R188,277 million. This is nearly a quarter of
the departmental budget.

The outputs for this massive expenditure need to be examined beyond
principles of statements and strategies. We need outputs in terms of
figures and rands and cents. We have been in discussion with the director-
general in the portfolio committee in developing quantifiable and
measurable outputs.

What we would therefore like to see under outputs would be, firstly,
measurable improvement in the competitiveness of South African industries;
secondly, a measurable and quantifiable increase in the pool of skills in
respect of new technology; thirdly, a percentage increase in patent
activities; fourthly, percentage growth in industrial output, harnessing
new technologies; fifthly, the extent of multiplier and accelerator
effects; and sixthly, the measurable total economic impact arising from
this programme.

The portfolio committee lauds the many initiatives undertaken by the
department. We say to the Minister and to his team: ``You have done very
well indeed.'' In the years in which the Minister has been at the helm of
South Africa's science and technology, he can be very proud of his
contribution to this country.

We are 100% behind the department in initiating 57 new technological
innovation projects in biotechnology, of which the Minister spoke. Like
shattered Japan after World War II, the new South Africa needs to push
rapidly to the front of the technological field. We must strive to be at
the forefront in respect of biotechnology.

The question, therefore, arises: What more should we be doing to become
world leaders in this area? After all, let us look at what South Africa
has. We have an entire floral kingdom in one country, and there are only
about six such floral kingdoms. We also have an indigenous knowledge system
which is deeply rooted in the understanding of flora and plants. Can we,
with these local advantages, therefore race ahead of this field? Also, are
our universities and research institutes keeping pace with the progress
that is being made?

The department, as I have said, must be lauded on its initiatives. But as
our challenges are too steep because of historic reasons, we have to say
that the reward for good work and for good foresight is to do still more
and more till all the needs of this country are answered. Such departmental
initiatives may just, therefore, be the catalyst that really sets off the
African Renaissance. If that happens, we will fulfil the solemn promise of
a better life for all.

The Ministry has the backing of Parliament - and by that I mean not only
the portfolio committee but, I hope, of every single member who is here -
because our Ministry will depend on what happens in the hon members'
constituencies to go forward. [Interjections.] Thank you, I am glad that
someone is giving support. I wish it was more voluble from all of the hon
members, and I encourage hon members. [Applause.]

I am certain that there is a great pot of gold at the end of the
biodiversity rainbow. I am even glad that the FF is acknowledging this. I
say thank you to Dr Mulder. [Applause.] This is our challenge in this
financial year.

Now let me turn to the department's corporate goal of achieving greater
efficiency and exploiting the economic potential of the arts. The Minister
outlined this in great detail. Once again, I say to the Minister and his
team: ``Well done.'' This is the direction in which South Africa has to
head and we are very grateful for the visionary leadership that the
Minister and the team are giving to Parliament and to the country.

The goal of greater efficiency and exploiting the economic potential is
also dealt with on page 244 of the Estimate of Expenditure. Indeed, we
fully subscribe to this goal. Once again, we need to look at mathematical
and measurable outputs. In this respect, let us ask the following
questions. What was the number of newcomers to the economic arena of the
arts? How many new and sustainable jobs were created here? What was the
value of our exports in this matter? What percentage of GDP was realised
from this sector?

In the UK the arts have been conservatively estimated to contribute Â£60
billion or 4% of their GDP. It is also the fastest expanding segment of the
British economy. Can we make comparable claims, and do the figures here
support such an assertion? The pertinent question we need to ask therefore
is: Can we, through the department, pull the necessary strings for 100 000
new jobs to be created in the field of the arts? This is the pressing
question of our times. Our democracy, reconciliation and even our social
stability depend on our satisfactory answers to the cries of the jobless
and the unemployed.

Here are some of our suggestions regarding the things that could be done:
Firstly, let us declare the year 2000 the year of music. Secondly, let us
declare annually a cultural city of the year. In 1990 the city of Glasgow
was declared the European city of culture. The regeneration that has taken
place and all the developments that have followed in that city are things
that we can witness and admire.

Thirdly, let us pursue a three-language goal for all South Africans, use
rewards and incentives to drive this in a given period of time so that
within 18 to 24 months all South Africans know, at least, three languages,
one of which should be a black language. Fourthly, let us identify and
promote language acquisition along a broad front - Eastern and Western -
which will directly support tourism - and I am sure Ms Mahlangu will be
happy about that - and trade with those countries that are still new and
undeveloped markets.

Let us also create an optimal, if not universal, viewership of South
African-made films. What percentage of South Africans, can we ask, saw
Chicken Biznes? How many of my colleagues here saw the film? I can tell
members that it is a film well worth seeing. What can we do to develop
cinema audiences, particularly in townships and particularly for products
that are made in South Africa?

Similarly, let us support travelling groups. In England there is a group
called Illyria which has enormous success in this respect, and I think they
could teach us a thing or two which we should be happy to learn. Let us,
with provincial and municipal governments, create multidimensional craft
and tourist centres to support beadwork, wood carving and leather work. In
this respect, let us push harder for bead manufacturing in our country. We
know we are about to enter this, but let us do it sooner and quicker and
bigger.

Let us also get Cabinet to agree that South African crafters and developers
can obtain - and this is an important point for which all of Parliament
should give support - locally mined gold, locally sourced diamonds, locally
mined platinum and steel at local domestic rates, not at Zurich rates and
not at London rates. [Applause.] This is prohibitive, and I think
Parliament can no longer tolerate the situation. We mine it here, and
therefore we should give it domestic rates. I hope that Dr Davids will take
this up.

With regard to script writing, the more we develop it, the more we will
have local TV, theatre and films. Let us also take another look at our
galleries and museums this year. Are we getting a 200% increase in the
people going through the turnstiles? Are our museums headed for growth?
What can we do to interact with them to ensure that we put our museums
where they should be? Colleagues should remember that these museums are the
repositories of R6 billion worth of assets, and that is a conservative
estimate. That is the treasure that we have, and we should exploit it
further.

Next is design and branding, and I know this is the Minister's hobbyhorse.
I know that he will ride this hobbyhorse and we will support him in making
sure that we brand properly, because part of South Africa's problem is
basically perception. And if we can correct perception through better
branding, this country is headed for great times.

Finally, I want to give attention to a programme called Linnux. We should
offer at least 10 000 bursaries for South African students to study Linnux.
Linnux is a computer programme that is free of charge, and its potential
for development is unlimited. In this respect we should also think of a
free code for our teachers so that they can develop applications for
schools. We believe that in this respect there will come a time in which
there will be fewer and fewer politicians in Parliament and more and more
scientists. We hope that with these computer programmes there will be
greater encouragement, especially in our black schools, in technology
education. This is the era of IT, and if IT misses our schools, it is going
to miss a very important segment of our population.

I wish to support the programme of the department and the budget on behalf
of the IFP, and to say that it is a great privilege to do so.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson,
let me begin by saying that I feel very privileged to be talking in this
House in the midst of an audience of esteemed future scientists and future
arts and culture experts. [Applause.] I can only say to the young people
that, indeed, the future is theirs.

In many ways the past few years have been devoted to setting up the
necessary policy frameworks and institutional capacity needed to transform
and develop our science and technology, arts and culture. We are now at a
stage where we can begin to concentrate on focused interventions in meeting
the task set out in our mission statement, which is to realise the full
potential of arts, culture, science and technology in social and economic
development, in nurturing creativity and innovation and promoting the
diverse heritage of our country.
I would like, at this stage, in fact, to congratulate the Department of
Arts and Culture. We are a small department of very dedicated people. I
also want to congratulate those who have the responsibility in our science
council to improve the quality of life of our people and make our economy
grow.

One of the agencies that the department supports from our budget is the
National Research Foundation - NRF. We have mandated the NRF to develop
research capacity from natural sciences to social sciences. The continuing
challenge of change and the diverse priorities and expectations of the
country are reflected in the NRF's new portfolio focus areas of research
promotion and capacity-building.

In some focus areas investments are targeted at topics such as information
and communication technology, globalisation and economic growth, while
others promote research in areas where South Africa has unique research
opportunities or the potential to be world leaders in a specific field.
These focus areas provide a framework for researchers to grapple with
important research issues and to provide an innovative training environment
for future South African research leaders.
The NRF acts as a catalyst within the research community to strengthen our
research capacity and enhance research excellence, productivity and
relevance. The Sociology of Work Unit at Wits University, the Child
Development Research Unit at the University of Natal, the Health Behaviour
Research Unit at the University of the North and other research centres are
being enabled to conduct their critical areas of work through the support
of the NRF.

The newly-instituted Health Behaviour Research Unit at the University of
the North, for example, focuses on the behavioural, mental and social
circumstances of disease. Its four main projects deal with understanding
health behaviour that leads to prevention, intervention and rehabilitation
with reference to chronic diseases, HIV/Aids and sexually transmitted
diseases or family or community violence and substance abuse.

We are acutely aware of the fact that the arena of scientific research is
still dominated by white men. However, great strides are being made in
ensuring that women scientists are taking up their rightful place as
research leaders. At Rhodes University, for example, Prof Tebello Nyokong
and her research group are involved in international collaboration in the
emerging field treating certain cancers with light which is called
photodynamic therapy. This novel therapy has enormous potential for the
affordable treatment of several kinds of cancer and for developing advanced
skills in the country. Health for a quality of life is a strong research
area at Technikon Pretoria where Prof Elsa Albertse is heading a project to
combat malnutrition in South Africa.

In the School of Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of
Natal, Prof Pat Berjak and her team make a vital contribution to
agriculture with their custom-designed conductivity meter for testing the
quality of seeds. These are only a few examples of women scientists using
their knowledge and talents to improve industry, health and the general
quality of life of all South Africans. We are also involved, through the
NRF, in a concerted programme to develop, train and offer support to black
research academics, at both the historically black and historically white
tertiary institutions.

In countries all over the world, there is a growing consciousness of the
need to develop and protect indigenous knowledge systems. South Africa has
a rich and well-established indigenous knowledge system, as Mr Cassim has
indicated. We are working at addressing the intellectual property and other
related issues in policy on indigenous knowledge systems. A significant mix
of South African society, policy makers, civil society, academia and the
scientific research community have been grappling with the complex issue of
indigenous knowledge, challenges and responsibilities of the state and
society in respect of promoting and protecting the rights and status of the
holders of such knowledge who are, in most cases, communities rather than
individuals. However, the current framework appears inadequate to support
and nurture the promotion of indigenous knowledge systems in our country.

The Ministry of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology recently commissioned
a study to be conducted in India. The aim of the research visit was to
study the Indian government's approaches and historical experiences
relating to the promotion, protection, legal framework, research base,
community participation and commercialisation of indigenous knowledge
systems. Lessons from this study will inform the current evolving
legislative process.

In addition, Dacst earmarked R10 million in the year 2000 to be granted by
NRF to selected researchers and projects in order for them to develop our
understanding, use and protection of indigenous knowledge systems. So far,
the NRF has awarded 41 research grants in this area, which will involve
more than 300 team members and research partners, as well as almost 250
postgraduate research students. This nucleus of dedicated researchers will
grow rapidly in the current and forthcoming years as our understanding of
the importance of this field grows.

We believe that we have been successful in transforming the science and
technology system away from its focus on supporting the defence objectives
of the previous government and towards serving the socioeconomic
development objectives of the newly elected democratic Government. Science
and technology is, indeed, playing a key role in improving the quality of
life of all South Africans and ensuring that we remain competitive within
the rapidly globalising world economy.

We have also reached a point within the arts and culture sectors where our
investment in an enabling policy framework and independent arm's-length
institution is beginning to pay off. The National Arts Council - NAC - was
allocated R10 million, if hon members still remember, in the 1997-98
financial year, R15 million in 1998-99 and R25 million in 1999-2000. Their
allocation has increased partly to try to keep pace with the unprecedented
demands for grants from a wide range of arts projects. The availability of
project funding from the NAC has served as a catalyst for a range of arts
initiatives in a wide variety of previously neglected disciplines serving
previously neglected audiences around the country.

Now that the administrative systems have been properly set up and
provincial arts councils have been established, it is hoped that the NAC
will begin to expand its role beyond that of a mere distributor of funds
and focus more on its own initiatives to develop the full range of arts and
culture in this country. Indeed a number of challengers lie ahead. For
example, a breakdown of the disbursement of funds over the three years
shows that a disproportionate amount of funding requests are still being
received from theatre, music and opera sectors. Only 9% of allocations have
gone to craft initiatives and 5% to literature projects.

In addition, 49% of funding went to projects in Gauteng, 17% to KwaZulu-
Natal and 17% to the Western Cape. The other provinces still remain
severely underdeveloped and underrepresented in terms of arts and culture
activities. One of the key projects currently under way at the NAC is
designed to combat some of these discrepancies. The NAC has designed the
crafts development initiative in collaboration with my department and a
number of other departments and organisations. The initiative is an
integrated interventionist strategy aimed at developing the crafts industry
in each province.

Working with provincial crafts development committees, the NAC will be co-
ordinating a range of training initiatives designed to turn crafters into
successful owners of sustainable small businesses. Training in business
skills, quality control, product development, marketing and strategic co-
operation are only some of the areas that will be covered in these training
programmes.

In his state of the nation address in February this year, our President
spoke of the cultural industries as one of the sectors of our economy that
require special attention because of their potential to contribute to the
objectives of higher growth rates and job creation. We are taking this
directive forward in a number of initiatives aimed at operationalising the
recommendations made in the cultural industries' growth strategy.

The National Film and Video Foundation of SA has now taken over the
allocation of national funding for the development and promotion of the
South African film industry. We believe that our film industry has
tremendous potential to make its mark in South Africa and internationally.
However, this requires that we invest the relatively limited resources
available as strategically as possible. It is absolutely vital that we
begin to invest in our most talented film producers so that the rights of
their films remain with them and within the country rather than in other
countries.

If South African films are to succeed, we need to find innovative ways of
investing in them. The National Film and Video Foundation of SA is
currently investigating mechanisms to begin a loan financing scheme whereby
some of its funds are allocated as loans and are recovered and reinvested
in the fund once a film has proved to be financially successful. This money
can then be used to produce other films.

Just as human resource development is a key area of focus for us in the
area of science and technology, it is also a challenge in the arts and
culture sector. The Skills Development Act requires the establishment of
Sector Education and Training Authorities, and arts, culture and the
cultural industries fall predominantly within the media, advertising,
print, packaging and publishing Seta.

We have been part of the process to set up the maps Seta and the tourism,
hospitality, sport and education training authority. The sheer volume of
employment opportunities has surprised even us. We are currently working
with Seta, as well as the South African Qualifications Agency, to accredit
a range of skills, programmes, qualifications and learnerships within the
arts and culture sector. A large percentage of South Africans working
within the arts and culture sector have nonformal training institutions
such as in community art centres. Others have not got into the industry via
apprenticeships, but do not have any formal qualifications. We need to
address this.

I have just had a signal that I must conclude my speech. In conclusion I
would like to say to all those working with us to keep up the good work. I
also want to inform my colleague the hon Minister that I am very happy
about the kind of relationship we have and I am confident that we will
deliver in the area of arts, culture, science and technology.

Let me then congratulate those that have been appointed to very strategic
positions in our associate institutions, such as Sahra. Firstly, I would
like to congratulate Mrs Pumla Madiba; Mr Dominee; Miss Lindiwe Gadu, CEO
of Freedom Park; Dr Tema, chief director, public liaison; Dr J Matsila,
technology development; Pakamani Mthembu, director in the Ministry;
Nobubele Ngele, human resource management; Mandy Gilder, director, national
archives; Sydney Selepe, arts institutional governance; and Mrs Premi
Abalraju, who joins my office.

There are lots of challenges ahead, but I have confidence that we are going
to deliver the goals we have set ourselves. [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Chairperson, on Wednesday I said in Question Time that the
planned legislation for a Government language policy got lost in the
corridors of the Union Buildings. I am still convinced of that. When a
Constitution or a law cannot be enforced, it is of no use. At best, it
becomes an interesting discussion document. As a result of this, we have
Chapter 9 in the South African Constitution which creates different bodies
to be watchdogs over democracy and to give the Constitution teeth - powers
- to act. I can give hon members a lot of examples: the Human Rights
Commission, the Gender Commission, etc.

The Government also put relevant laws on the Statute Book to fight
discrimination against women, racism, etc. But seven years later, the only
watchdog and legislation that is not in place is that on culture and
language. The Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of
Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities is not in place. Language
policy and legislation is not in place. Can anyone blame the FF for
arguing, in this House and outside, that this is just not a priority for
this Government?

This Minister is not necessarily the guilty one. The ANC Government does
not know how to handle this issue. Today is Africa Unity Day. It is not
only the ANC that does not know how to handle this issue, most African
countries are struggling to handle this: How to promote African unity and
nation-building on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to give
recognition to Africa's diversity of languages and cultures. That is the
balance that we must get right in Africa.

Of course poverty is a problem in Africa and in South Africa. Of course
HIV/Aids is a problem. If you acknowledge my language, you acknowledge me
as a person and you give me dignity. Maybe that is more important than
anything else - all of these other problems.

On Wednesday I asked the Deputy President what the Government planned to do
to promote other official languages, apart from English. I told this House
about the Xhosa-speaking woman in front of me in the queue at a Government
office and how she struggled to get her problem solved because the woman on
the other side could only speak English.

Is the Government willing to take active steps to force Government
departments to use other official languages apart from English? To force
them. That is the only way. Promises and goodwill are not enough anymore. A
first step would be to give powers to the Pan South African Language Board
to enforce these findings. Let me give the House an example. The Pan South
African Language Board, PanSALB, found the Department of Public Works and
Telkom guilty of using only English. That was more than a year ago; nothing
happened. The department and Telkom just ignored these findings.

Sonder 'n taalbeleid bestaan daar tans groot verwarring by die verskillende
departemente. Elke departement doen sy eie ding op sy eie manier en dit
veroorsaak verwarring. Die Suid-Afrikaanse statistiekdiens sÃª hulle het
mense nodig om te help met die opname van die sensus. Hulle soek
``previously disadvantaged persons'', maar hulle adverteer dit in Engels in
die Afrikaanse koerante. Is bruin Afrikaanssprekendes nou `disadvantaged'
aan daardie kant, is hulle nie welkom nie, of waar pas hulle in?

Die Departement van Justisie praat oor 'n hofbeleid. Hier het ek die syfers
van die Noord-Kaap waar 72% van die hofsake in Afrikaans was en 1% in
Engels. Die Minister sÃª slegs Engels moet gebruik word. Ek verstaan dit
nie. [Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In the absence of a language policy great confusion currently exists among
the various departments. Each department does it own thing in its own way
and this is causing confusion. The South African statistics service says
they need people to help with the recording of the census. They are looking
for previously disadvantaged persons, but they advertise in English in the
Afrikaans newspapers. Are coloured Afrikaans speakers now `disadvantaged'
on that side, are they not welcome or where do they fit in?

The Department of Justice talks about a court policy. I have here the
figures of the Northern Cape, where 72% of the court cases were in
Afrikaans and 1% in English. The Minister says only English must be used. I
do not understand that. [Time expired.]]

Ms S D MOTUBATSE: Chairperson, today I am happy that I am participating in
this important debate on the budget of arts and culture. I emphasise the
word important, because I acknowledge the role that could be played by this
sector in the transformation of our society. We have been able to use arts
and culture as a mirror to see where we come from, our present situation
and also to predict the future. Through arts and culture we were able to
express our emotions, especially during the apartheid era, when we were
able to express the emotional agonies that we were going through.

In our rural areas, we have men and women, both young and old, who cannot
read or write, but who are able to express their intellectual ability
through arts and cultural dances that they perform. The most important
aspect of arts and culture is also to connect spiritually with our Creator
and with our ancestors. Some of the activities that are currently being
demonstrated here show just how important this sector is for our society.

Like others, I would like to say to our Minister, Dr Ngubane, the Deputy
Minister, Sis Brigitte and the director-general, that surely this
department is on track. We are happy that the Minister's team is here also
to hear our views.

The report that we have received from the department shows the
transformation plan clearly. I must say that through this transformation we
have seen the increase of local and international respect for this sector,
South African arts and culture. I would also like to echo the sentiments
expressed by Mr Cassim, that this sector has come a long way and that it is
taking the right direction.

The establishment of the community centres gives ordinary men and women a
chance to improve their work, and we think that this is a step in the right
direction. Training for these talented people does improve the quality of
their lives and their work, and it has economic spin-offs for most of our
artists who were living like hoboes in the past.

The empowerment programme, especially for the rural communities,
particularly rural women, is the key to the whole transformation process.
However, I want to bring another aspect to this debate, because much as we
want to expose them or want them to gain momentum in what they are doing,
there is also a need to protect them.

There is a lot that is happening currently. We have so many thieves, and we
have seen some people just parachuting to certain areas and studying the
art or the dances of our people and replicating them somewhere else. Now,
the challenge is: How do we protect these people? For example, currently
there are designs on the BA, but we are not sure about the contracts which
were entered into with those artists who did this work. So, it is important
for us to protect those people.

The other challenge is to ensure that our people who have been working hard
are protected. For example, we have, in literature, writers such as O K
Matsepe, who have written important educational books for our society, but
we have not really done much to expose their work.

We want to support the training and education programme as outlined by the
departmental plan. We want to ensure that it opens the way for the other
cultural groups which were also not in the mainstream.

The establishment of the National Arts Council, I must say, was another
milestone for our country. The changes in the funding policies and
procedures are surely targeting the previously disadvantaged, and I hope
that the panel advisory groups will assist in expediting the establishment
of some of the Setas, because they can enter into negotiations with
different groups. Anyway, we are aware of certain challenges as well.

In my conclusion I must thank the department and also the Minister for the
progress that has been made thus far. I also want us to be wary of some of
the activities that we cannot really support as Parliament. For instance,
we think that arts and culture should be there to promote good values in
our society and to build the younger generations. We as parliamentarians
therefore cannot support the dirty dances, and those kind of artists need
to be challenged and educated, and should not expect funding if they do not
change their ways.

I support the Vote. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I would like to
request you to recognise the many young people who are in the public
gallery this morning, and I would like to welcome them to Parliament.
[Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, all people in the world develop and advance on
the basis of their culture and history. Wise nations absorb whatever they
can from outside which improves what they have without abandoning their
own. This is what African nations must do if they are not to completely
lose their identity in the world.

We must make human resources the main structure of our social and economic
organisation. Modern science and technology have a crucial role to play in
the struggle for our continent's economic prosperity and technological
advancement.

The acquisition of knowledge and advanced technology will enable us to
process our raw materials on this continent and export them as finished
products. This will ensure that we get a good price for our products and
eradicate poverty. It is a tragedy that we in this country have exported
our uranium as raw material for peanuts to other countries, such as the
USA, in order for them to develop nuclear weapons with which to endanger
the world and acquire nuclear technology, which we do not have.

This country must launch an Africanist cultural revolution to rid itself of
Western decadence, which is destroying the moral fibre of African nations.
We must reintroduce the precolonial culture of hard work which prevailed in
African societies. It is only through our own sweat and the discarding of
the colonial mentality of depending on the leftovers from the tables of
others, that we can prosper and restore Africa to her dignity and her lost
power.

The indigenous technology which has been destroyed by colonialism must be
researched and preserved. Our ancestors dug gold and copper in Mapungubwe
long before Jan van Riebeeck arrived in 1652. They made iron tools and they
knew how to preserve food for years when the harvest was bad.

The economic system indigenously called ``mafisa'' in Sesotho and
``ukunqoma'' in isiXhosa, eliminated poverty. Nobody was without
employment. We must research this destroyed indigenous knowledge. We must
not look down on African epistemology. African herbs with medicinal value
must be researched as well as naturally grown edible vegetables. A nation
without knowledge of its own is no nation.

African languages must be developed, especially their terminology of
technology. African languages are lagging far behind in the race to cope
with modern technology. Secondly, we must not allow our cultural concepts
to be polluted by foreign languages. For instance, what is this nonsense
about the so-called ``bride price'' and ``bride wealth'' for ``bohadi'' or
``lobola''? Why does the English language not admit that it cannot
translate some concepts in the African culture which have no equivalent in
their culture instead of using misleading terms such as ``bride price'' and
``bride wealth''?

We do not sell our women. This colonialisation and misinterpretation of
African concepts must be stopped. The history of this country must be
recorded correctly. It must not be left to sectarian Eurocentric forces to
write it for their parochial self-interest and false political propaganda.
A falsified history is a mutilated history - it is no history. It is a
glorified myth. It will not stand the test of time. Future generations
would rewrite it when they discover untruth in it.

Our children must know the role which the women of Africa have played in
our history, for instance, Mkabayi on the night King Shaka was
assassinated; Queen Mmanthatise, the commander of men in the battle in the
wars of national resistance against colonialism; Mmantsopa the prophetess;
Nahenda who was hanged for leading the 1905-06 war of national resistance
in Rhodesia against British imperialism; Queen Nzinga of Angola who fought
against slavery; Queen Kandeka who commanded her own African army in
defence of Africa against the Romans, and who defeated Julius Ceasar's
powerful and most feared army of the times - she lost an eye in that war;
Queen Nefertiti and Queen Nefertari, who were involved in the creation of
ancient African civilisations.

We need to remember that for most of our time in our African existence on
this earth, we fed ourselves. We clothed and housed ourselves. We educated
ourselves. We governed ourselves. We built our own civilisations. If we
created a better world before, we can do so again. We are the only people
who can make universal promises and keep them, because we have no designs
on the land and resources of others.

The PAC supports this Vote. [Applause.]

[Ms N D MBOMBO: Chairperson, I would like to greet all the comrades,
particularly Mbovu, the hon Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology, the woman who is married to the Bhele clan, the hon Mrs
Brigitte Mabandla, and the hon Dr Serote.]

I am happy today because we have young politicians, young scientists and
young technologists up there, who in ten years' time will be on this podium
and saying something that I am going to say now.

Today I am talking about community art centres. The overall aim of the
Portfolio Committee on Arts, Culture, Science and Technology on the
countrywide availability of community art centres for our rural communities
especially, is based around the concept that the advancement of African
culture is accomplished by creating a positive climate, thus contributing
to the quality of life, through involvement in the social and economic
upliftment of all African communities, that is the total transformation of
our communities.
The whole concept is in line with the ideals of the African Renaissance.
The community art centres are meant to cultivate and nurture skills and
creativity of the disadvantaged communities, so that quality African
products in arts and culture will emerge, as well as to foster active
consciousness of African languages, science and technology. Thus emphasis
should be placed on the optimum use of these centres by the communities.

That will instill and inspire community ownership thereof, a situation
likely to avert their being vandalised. In certain towns one sees a
situation in which youth take turns in volunteering to guard their own
community centres.

The portfolio committee adopted a business plan through which the community
art centres will be fully utilised to restore the vibrancy of all art forms
in order to demonstrate the marriage between languages and Indigenous
Knowledge Systems - IKS - in bringing arts and culture and science and
technology together.

The plan also emphasises the creation of partnerships between interested
parties and stakeholders. Since one of their aims is the full utilisation
of these centres by our youth, we are eagerly looking towards and waiting
for institutions such as Telkom and Eskom to assist considerably in helping
our youth become computer literate in these centres and training them in
technology and related activities.

In the spirit of building and creating partnerships with stakeholders, as
articulated in the business plan, the Department of Arts, Culture, Science
and Technology has been requested, as a pilot project, to identify a
handful of community art centres, which it will assist with funding and the
necessary expertise and skills, in an endeavour to create models out of
them and also for hands-on experience on perceived problems in the running
and control of these centres.

We are grateful that the vision of these centres of eventually becoming
schools of excellence is not far-fetched, if one looks at the progress and
achievements of other centres, such as the Ntuzuma Arts Centre, which are
working within the spirit of the vision as outlined in the business plan.
The centres are also places of entertainment, as games and the teaching of
our culture and art are simultaneously taking place.
With the establishment of the Indigenous Knowledge Systems Unit in the
department, we are eagerly looking forward to visible IKS activities in the
centres, including story telling to our youth on traditional knowledge and
culture. As our portfolio committee's other responsibility is to improve
the lot of those whose cultures, artistry, creativity and scientific and
technological innovations were marginalised in the past Ã¿.Ã¿.Ã¿.  [Time

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, the hon Mr Aucamp
who normally speaks for only one minute, has an unbelievable four minutes
... [Interjections] ... and he has actually removed his cardigan in order
to make sure that he is equal to the task.

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, people will leave this chamber if they know it is
going to be four minutes! [Laughter.]

'n Debat oor kuns en kultuur is nie baie gewild nie, dÃ­t sien ons
vanoggend. Geen party gaan daarmee 'n verkiesing wen of verloor nie. Wie
raak nou opgewonde oor kuns, kultuur en wetenskap as jou lewe en eiendom
deur misdaad bedreig word, as die rand se waarde tuimel, as Minister Trevor
Manuel die skroewe aandraai en as die massas daagliks moet veg vir blote
oorlewing?

Ons in Suid-Afrika moet daarteen waak dat die stryd om oorlewing nie so
oorheersend word nie dat ons die estetiese van die lewe verwaarloos, of dat
die gelykmakende effek van globalisering ons laat verdof tot vaal,
identiteitlose gemeenskappe nie. Ons moet sorg dat ons vir ons kinders meer
nalaat as McDonald-agentskappe en Visa-banktellermasjiene. Ons mag nie
``plastic'' word nie. Ons moet daarvoor sorg dat wanneer die toeris deur
die strate van Pretoria of Kaapstad stap, dit anders moet lyk en klink as
in New York of in Parys, dit moet 'n ander ervaring wees.

Deur die eeue heen word die gehalte van 'n beskawing gemeet aan sy
nalatenskap ten opsigte van kuns en kultuur, die estetika van sy bouwerke,
sy beeldhou en sy literatuur. Ons mag nie toelaat dat kuns en kultuur die
Aspoestertjie en die stiefkind word en dat diÃ© verhewe deel van ons
menswees in Suid-Afrika deur die ``rat race'' van elke dag se bestaan
oorheers en gemarginaliseer word nie. Daarom steun die AEB die befondsing
van kuns en kultuur in ons land.

Suid-Afrika is uniek vanweÃ« die rykdom en verskeidenheid van sy kulture.
Deur ons kultuurverskeidenheid bied ons 'n wÃªreld binne een land. In watter
ander land ter wÃªreld kan jy van boeremusiek tot kwaito luister, van
operasang tot die klank van simfonie-orkeste, die trom en die marimba van
Afrika? Ons moet diÃ© verskeidenheid voed en koester. Ons moet leer om
mekaar se kulture oor en weer te waardeer en respekteer. Die een mag nooit
vir die ander 'n bedreiging wees nie, daarvoor is die vlaktes van Suid-
Afrika te oop en sy horisonne te wyd. Ons mag nie toelaat dat kulturele
imperialisme die unieke eiesoortigheid van ons verskillende
kultuurgemeenskappe verdring tot 'n vaal en eentonige eendersheid nie.

Die AEB pleit dat ons diÃ© verskeidenheid in groter mate verdiskonteer in
die wyse waarop die staat met kuns en kultuur omgaan. Elke
kultuurgemeenskap moet oor eie strukture vir kuns en kultuur beskik wat
sonder inmenging deur die sentrale regering bedryf kan word. Staatsgeld
moet op billike wyse aan die onderskeie kulture en strukture beskikbaar
gestel word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[A debate on arts and culture is not a very popular one, this we can see
this morning. No party can win or lose an election with arts and culture.
Who becomes excited about arts, culture and science when one's life and
property are threatened by crime, when the value of the rand is tumbling,
when Minister Trevor Manuel is putting the screws on and when the masses
have to fight on a daily basis for mere survival?

We in South Africa should guard against the struggle for survival becoming
so overwhelming that we neglect the aesthetics of life, or that the
equalising effect of globalisation causes us to fade into pale,
identityless communities. We should ensure that we leave behind more than
McDonald agencies and Visa bank teller machines for our children. We must
not become plastic. We have to ensure that when a tourist walks through the
streets of Pretoria or Cape Town, they look and sound different to those in
New York or Paris; it should be a different experience.

Through the ages the quality of a civilisation has been measured by its
heritage with regard to arts and culture, the aesthetics of its buildings,
its sculpture and its literature. We must not allow arts and culture to
become the Cinderella and the stepchild and allow this lofty part of our
humanity in South Africa to become dominated and marginalised by the rat
race of everyday existence. Therefore, the AEB supports the financing of
arts and culture in our country.

South Africa is unique because of the wealth and diversity of its cultures.
Through our cultural diversity we present a world in one country. In which
other country in the world can one listen to everything from boeremusiek to
kwaito, from opera to the sound of symphony orchestras, the drum and the
marimba of Africa? We must nurture and cherish this diversity. We must
learn to appreciate and respect one another's cultures. The one must never
be a threat to the other, since the plains of South Africa are too open and
its horizons too wide for this to happen. We must not allow cultural
imperialism to suppress the unique distinctiveness of our different
cultural communities in a pale and monotonous uniformity.

The AEB's plea is that we should take this diversity into account to a
greater extent in the manner in which the state deals with arts and
culture. Every cultural community should possess its own structures for
arts and culture which can be managed without interference from the central
Government. State funds must be made available in a fair manner to the
different cultures and structures.]

The building blocks for real nation-building are the recognition and
advancement of the different cultures in South Africa. One overall state
department of arts and culture is not the answer. I want to plead for the
devolution of powers of Government on issues intimately interwoven with the
culture of the community itself.

The mission of the Department of Arts and Culture should be to decentralise
as much as possible, not only geographically, but also culturally. In this
regard, the long overdue Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the
Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities, as set out in
section 185 of the Constitution, can play an important role. The
establishment of different cultural councils envisaged in the draft Bill is
of the utmost importance in the promotion of the heritage of our diversity.

If the section 185 commission were to legally and financially empower
cultural communities which belong to civil society to take control of their
own affairs, that would be a positive step in the right direction.

As gekyk word na die begroting van die departement, moet heelwat meer geld
gedesentraliseer word. Daar moet nie bloot lippediens aan die erkenning van
die multidimensionele samelewing bewys word nie. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[When one looks at the budget of this department, one sees that much more
money must be decentralised. Mere lip service should not be paid to the
acknowledgement of this multidimensional society.]

The Department of Arts and Culture, in co-ordination with the section 185
commission, is in a position to lead South Africa towards the full
realisation of the slogan that is on our coat of arms, which says: ``Unity
in diversity''. We dare not fail in this challenge. [Applause.]

[Legofi.] (Translation of Setswana speech follows.)

[Dr M W SEROTE: Chairperson, I would like to speak like I did yesterday. I
shall start off by saying that it is very good when there is an
understanding between the Minister, the Deputy Minister and the leadership
of the arts and culture portfolio committee in Parliament. These talks are
about what we should do in order to go forward. I would like to associate
myself again with this statement, by saying that it is good when things are
like this.

I would like to inform the Minister and the Deputy Minister that I did not
sleep last night, but lay awake. I was wakeful because I was asking myself
about the past year. I scrutinised the amounts that we are talking about
today, and the five aspects below, and I was wondering what I was going to
say. Now I do not know how to say it, because the school children are here.
Anyway, I will talk. They should also know that even the Minister and the
Deputy Minister are allocated marks in Parliament. At the time when I was
dropping off to sleep, when I was about to fall sleep, I said, no, there is
progress in our department. I said that, out of five, I allocate four.
[Applause.]

We have heard many speakers who spoke before me. They talked about amounts,
how they are used, and how we are proceeding, etc. What I would like to
stress is that the duty of the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology is one of those that stresses the hon Mr Thabo Mbeki's vision
that I was talking of yesterday, when he talks of the African re-awakening
as well as the Millennium Africa Recovery Programme.

When I look at all that we are doing in this department, especially in the
field of science and technology, I realise that we have upheld the aims of
building South Africa so that it would help Africa in its re-awakening. It
is for that reason that, in my opinion, it is proper that we should be
happy today and tell our children who are here about all that we are doing
to build so that when they reach this stage, they should add on to and
strengthen it. [Applause.]

There are five aspects that I would like to present to the Minister for
discussion. The road that we have travelled is a long one. Many things have
happened. I thought that the time for a meeting had arrived, so that the
Minister's department, his assistant and the head of the arts and culture
committee, including us as members of Parliament, and the community at
large, should meet again and say that we have walked the walk, and that
these are the things that we have done. Do we have the ability?

Secondly, it is pleasing for Parliament to think that as a committee, in
respect of financial matters, how we are associated with it at its
beginning, and not at the end. Again, I thought that this is one thing that
we should sit down and talk about.

Thirdly, I think that the route that we took in re-awakening tradition has
started to bear testimony to what we are doing, because soon we will be
sitting in Parliament discussing a Bill on how to protect and take them
forward, etc.

I was saying that when we are here, we should think that the time has
arrived to think about the projects that we can pursue. As members of
Parliament, we are hereby putting these two projects before the Minister
for him to assess whether they are acceptable.

The first one is to find out whether is it possible to start discussions
with the community about building places where beads could be made, as such
a place does not exist in South Africa. Is it possible to think of a
beadwork firm?

Secondly, recently the pharmaceutical companies took us to court. We came
back smiling because we defeated them. We went to court to talk about the
existing medication and medicines that are unavailable in our country.
These are the medicines of the traditional healers. I think that most of
the existing Western medicines are derived from the traditional ones. Is it
not possible today for the Government to start building a school for
traditional healers?
I was talking to the Minister and others, saying that there is a place
called Vlakplaas. When most of us as black people here think of Vlakplaas,
we get angry because of the inhuman things that were done there. I think
that if we were to build such a school at Vlakplaas, we would be cleansing
it, especially when we will be ensuring that training of traditional
healers will be moved forward. This is a project that I would like us to
discuss with the Minister.

We are extremely proud that the legislation which established the
Foundation for Education, Science and Technology has been passed, as we
expected it would be.

I believe that the Minister will remember that there was a man known as Dr
Verwoerd, who said in 1955 that if one were to teach science and technology
to the black people, one would make them think that they were whites. When
I look as this FEST, it changes that perception because it talks of
informing the community about science and technology. It talks about how a
community can make use of science and technology. It again teaches them
that science and technology is knowledge that builds, that does the work
and is progressing.
I should emphasise this point, because it adds to what we said, namely that
1998 was the year of science and technology. We have moved forward and now
we are looking at the community at large and not talking of one year but
many years to come, because we know that we are not doing this only for
ourselves as South Africans, but for Africa as a whole. We are also looking
at how to help the people in the world.

In conclusion, we are very glad about the development of the languages. We
have already heard that we are continuing with the inclusion of a languages
section in the national body. When we had discussions with Mrs Marivate and
her colleagues, there was evidence that there was a lot of progress in our
country. I am saying that we should not be impatient, because we have only
been doing this for seven years. There is a lot of work that has been done
and it will soon bear fruit.

I am glad that the Minister has brought all the members from his
department, ie the sections on culture, languages, science and technology.
We would be extremely happy today if this House were full of men and women
of this Parliament, because I presume that they know that this department
is the foundation of the community and tradition. [Applause.]]

Mr S E OPPERMAN: Mr Chairperson, I agree with the mission statement of the
department that we need to realise the full potential of arts and culture
for our social and economic development and to nurture creativity and
innovation in order to promote the diverse, but exciting, heritage of our
nation.

In this regard I want to congratulate the hon the Minister and our High
Commissioner to London, the honourable Cheryl Carolus, and the members of
her team, such as Lorna de Smidt, for the excellent work they are doing,
especially now during the ``Celebrate South Africa'' campaign, although we
do not support everything we saw.

It is only when identity, values, ethics, customs, beliefs, knowledge,
ideas and concepts which reside in our hearts are expressed in our daily
walk. It is only when we live it, and live it with a passion, that we can
add value to the mission statement.

If we can instill this intangible culture in people, then, and only then,
will they also take care of our scenic parks, wildlife, sites of historic
importance, national monuments, works of art, museum collections, etc, and
unfortunate incidents like the stealing of a bronze statue in Pretoria,
which commemorated the drowning of 607 black soldiers in the English
Channel in 1917, will no longer occur.

So we need a coherent and practical vision without which we will not have
the ability and the willingness to apply the required responsibility in
creating real capacity to recruit and develop human resources of quality.

We need to recognise and have mutual respect for our cultural diversity.
With this attitude, we will enhance political stability and create many
social and economic opportunities.

WÃªreldwyd is kultuurgegronde bedrywe soos musiek en sang, video en
televisie, drama en kunsuitstallings van die grootste bydraers tot
ekonomiese groei. Amerika het dit reeds in die jare twintig besef en het
byvoorbeeld hul rolprentbedryf tot 'n formidabele bedryf ontwikkel.
Ons het geen probleem dat byna 60% van die begroting aan wetenskap en
tegnologie toegewys is nie, dit is 'n noodsaaklikheid. Die gedeelte van die
koek vir die kunste moet egter vergroot word. Die kunste is nie alleen
arbeidsintensief nie, maar kan ook werkskepping op baie groot skaal
bevorder. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Around the world culturally based activities like music and singing, video
and television, drama and art exhibitions are among the biggest
contributors to economic growth.  America already realised this in the
1920s and they have developed their film industry into a formidable
industry, for example.

We have no problem with the fact that nearly 60% of the budget has been
allocated to science and technology; this is essential.  However, the
portion of the cake for the arts must be enlarged.  The arts are not only
labour-intensive, but can also promote job creation on a very large scale.]

It is no use making speeches year after year about poverty alleviation if
we do not create the environment in which to make our dreams and policies
real.

If arts and culture is such an important creator of wealth in the world
economies, why are we removing arts-related subjects from our educational
curricula, instead of emphasising the importance of literature, art and
music in our schools? We need to discuss this with the Minister of
Education. If arts and culture were so important, why do we remove and hide
works of art here in our Parliament?

There must surely be a place somewhere for those artworks if we believe in
the promotion of our diversity. We cannot run away from our past, however
painful it may be. It is only when we explore the past and apply its
lessons as honestly and as objectively as possible that we can make sense
of the present and exert a possible influence on our future.

If arts and culture is one of the keys to the alleviation of poverty in our
country, why are we not using the opportunities through the state-
controlled media to educate, inform, inspire and transform the cultural
landscape of South Africa?

As die bevordering van kuns en kultuur ons erns is, moet ons aandag gee aan
byvoorbeeld ons vertaaldienste in die Parlement, in ons komitee en ook in
die openbare galery. Die behoefte daaraan is vanoggend weer baie duidelik
geÃ¯llustreer. As deel van ons hoop lÃª in die bevordering van kuns en
kultuur, moet die vestiging van standhoudende toneelgeselskappe onmiddellik
aandag kry en daar moet afgesien word van die georkestreerde pogings teen
opera, ballet en simfonie-orkeste. Dan moet die opgradering van biblioteke
weer hoog op die prioriteitslys geplaas word en moet logistieke, morele en
finansiÃ«le steun verleen word aan al ons museums, ook ons oorlogmuseums
binne en buite ons land. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[If we are serious about promoting arts and culture, we must, for example,
give attention to our translation services in Parliament, in our committees
and also in the public gallery.  The need for this was once again very
clearly illustrated this morning. If part of our hope lies in the promotion
of arts and culture, the establishment of lasting theatre companies must
receive immediate attention and the orchestrated onslaught against opera,
ballet and symphony orchestras must cease. In addition the upgrading of
libraries must once again be placed high on the priority list and
logistical, moral and financial support must be given to all our museums,
including our war museums within and outside our country.]

If we are really serious about the promotion of arts and culture, we must
stop the political interference in the councils and in the boards. We
cannot pretend that all is well in the department, that we have all the
answers, that there is no corruption, that the performing arts are not
struggling and that everyone is happy in the arts and cultural community.

The hon the Minister needs to deal with these problems openly, without fear
or favour. I know that unless we do these things and openly deal with the
problems confronting us, we will miss out on all the opportunities before
us, opportunities that we can grab to benefit all our people. [Applause.]

(Translation of Sesotho paragraphs follows.)

[Mr S L DITHEBE: Chairperson and distinguished guests in the gallery, I
will address the House in Sesotho, even though I know that you will not be
able to understand the language, and you do not have interpreters from
Sesotho into English or whichever other language you can understand.
However, the importance of choosing to speak in this language is that, as
we have 11 languages, we are proud of these languages, and we must be proud
of the beauty of our languages.

Mr Cassim, when he spoke here, said that 4% of the GDP of the economy in
the United Kingdom comes from what we call the ``creative arts'', and this
brings me to an important issue, the issue of films. This means that we, as
South Africans and the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology,
must make sure that a lot of people take an interest in viewing South
African films.

We train a lot of people who write scripts and the content of the films
that we make is uniquely South African. That is because we cannot be like
monkeys, copying everything that Hollywood does, and still think that we
will be able to contribute to the creative arts and the economy.

Every year we pay Americans R1 billion to view soapies like The Bold and
the Beautiful and Days of our Lives. The question is, should we be doing
that, even though we have the ability and the South African talent to
produce South African films? I do not want people to misunderstand me. I do
not mean that we should live in isolation, without any contact with the
world.

We know that British films, as well as those from America, will always be
viewed by South Africans. However, we should also give them some
competition, so that we should move from the position we are holding in the
worldwide list of film-making countries which is a little below position
40, and go up to the top 10 countries in film-making, world-wide. South
Africa has a beautiful heritage, which we are proud of.]

That glorious history of the triumph of the human spirit, a  history of
hope that transcended the power of the human being, is what guided us in
the most difficult years of this country, when we fought apartheid. Film is
one of those vehicles that we used even though there was a special
directorate dedicated to censorship of films. We used films in order to
carry on with our mass mobilisation and the final destruction and
obliteration of apartheid.

When the portfolio committee delegation, of which I was part, visited
London some two weeks ago, I had an opportunity to speak to somebody at the
Tricycle Theatre at Kilburn. This gentleman asked me whether he could have
access to video footage of the TRC hearings in which, in particular, our
Chief Whip was demonstrating how he was tortured and suffocated by the
notorious security cops at that time. He said that they wanted to make a
film of those incidents or of those stories that people recounted at the
TRC hearings, and that he wanted to take an actual look at the video
footage.

The question that arose in my mind and which I asked myself was: If this
man in London, who is not a South African, could think of this, why is it
that South Africans have not been the first ones on the ball and made a
film out of this in order to communicate to the world the pain and
suffering we went through?

I am not suggesting that people in other countries should not take interest
an, in the history of our country, whichever way they would like to depict
that to the rest of the world in order for the world to gain a better
understanding. All I am saying is that this takes me back to the issue of
developing audience and scriptwriting, as well as the content of the films.
It means therefore that we should take advantage of this and have more
people who are trained in scriptwriting so that they will have the capacity
to depict our own story and our own history to the world in the manner that
I have described earlier.

Some of the hon members here have spoken in very scathing terms,
criticising the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology for
having failed to do this, that and so forth. I would like to single out
specifically what the hon Gore said about a lack of technology here and
there, as if technology is a panacea for everything.

I would like to say that it was not by accident that this department is
called the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology. It is
because we realised, for the reasons our chairperson elucidated, that to
study science and technology, in as far as the black people of this country
are concerned, is something, we all know, they have been deprived of.

However, I want to say that former President Nelson Mandela spoke at length
about the RDP of the soul. And arts and culture can play a very critical
role in ensuring that our people develop that spirit of anticorruption and
antidishonesty, so that in our private and public lives we can carry
ourselves in such a way that there are no incidents of dishonesty or
corruption, or any other social ills that are not of any benefit to our
country.

I would also like to respond to those members who referred to the question
of languages. Unfortunately, each time some of these members speak of the
section 185 commission, they speak of it in very parochial terms, so as to
defend only a particular language, notably Afrikaans. [Interjections.] Why
is it that they do not say that the Constitution says that certain
languages, the nine African languages for instance, have had diminished use
and status historically, and therefore that we should get involved in the
crusade of transformation, transformation as a means to reconciliation? In
other words, let us say that while Afrikaans may not be at the level where
we want it to be, we nonetheless want to support the nine African languages
so that they can be on para with Afrikaans, English and other languages.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, if you could
just give me a moment first. Order!

Hon members we have in the gallery today two very eminent persons whom I
would like to recognise on behalf of Parliament and the people of South
Africa. These are Mr Francesco Frangialli who is the Secretary-General of
the World Tourism Organisation and our own Dr Dawie de Villiers who is the
Deputy Secretary-General of the same body. [Applause.] If both these
honourable members would perhaps stand, so that ...

An HON MEMBER: They did.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Did they? Thank you. Members
will recall that the honourable Dr Dawie de Villiers was a very important
member of this Chamber and also a former Cabinet Minister. At present they
are both based in Madrid in Spain. They are on their way to Namibia and
they are paying a fleeting visit. On behalf of everyone, I welcome them.
Mr Minister, you may now proceed.

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson, I, too,
welcome the presence of such eminent people as Dawie de Villiers and the
other honourable gentleman. However, I am even more thrilled that so many
young people are here today when we discuss this Vote which is very
critical for their own future.

We have committed ourselves to developing and bringing arts and cultural
activities to communities. Therefore we embarked on the programme of
community art centres primarily to give young people a chance to have the
arts brought to where they live in their communities. We need to provide
more funding for this, but above all, we need to provide people who can
train them in playing musical instruments, putting up their dramas, plays
and so on, and appreciating literature, and therefore developing
spiritually and creatively to become future leaders and contributors to our
economy.

I would like to thank the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology, Dr Serote, for his contribution, and I am
happy that he ranked us at more that 80% - I do not think it was only 80%,
I am sure it is more than that. I also want to thank the director-general
and the top management of the department, and other people who work with
us, for a job well done. The challenges are huge, but the commitment, the
creativity, the innovation and the determination is there, as has been
acknowledged by this House with the contributions that have been made.

I would like to assure the hon Opperman that wherever Dacst detects
corruption, it acts very swiftly. There are two prominent examples where
disciplinary hearings have been instituted against senior people in the
department and appropriate sentences passed. We do not condone any form of
corruption.

As far as transforming the arts and culture landscape is concerned, we have
to do this. This does not mean the centralising of arts and culture
administration, but it simply means that we have detected the shortcomings
in the system and the way our institutions work, and are rectifying this
for the good of the people of South Africa.

As far as Vlakplaas is concerned, its demons must be exorcised. Possibly,
the Indigenous Knowledge Systems and the healer school there could be a
very useful ways of doing that. But we must also remember that the horrors
of the past must be exhibited. For instance, Dachau in Germany and other
concentration camps are there today so as to teach the future generations
the tragedy and horror which is created when political power goes very
wrong. We will consider the hon member's proposal, and we will take
appropriate steps to engage with the portfolio committee on how Vlakplaas
is going to be dealt with.

Similarly with the beads factory, we have commissioned a study by the CSIR.
There is a real prospect that we are going to have a South African beads
factory which will help the crafts industry tremendously. [Applause.]

We support the idea of the imbizo. We have declared this year the Year of
the Crafter. Sometime in October we want to have a huge exhibition and a
national conference on crafts, because, as has been appropriately
identified by many members here, it is a source of easy jobs and accessible
and affordable incomes for rural communities, and is also a very important
tool in urban regeneration. We shall also call other imbizos in the course
of this year, something which we will discuss with the portfolio committee.

The idea of spirituality having a central position in our programme, I
think, is a very good one. This issue is very important when we refer to
the values that we need to generate and encourage in our society. That
point was also taken very well.

Prof Mohamed mentioned something about irregularities in the nuclear
regulator sector. We will deal with this with the Minister of Minerals and
Energy, but I can assure hon members that I do not think that the
regulatory framework poses any threat to the South African society.
Nevertheless, we will take this issue up because we need absolute
certainty.
The Safari Nuclear Reactor is not a national facility as yet. However, it
is being used for educational purposes, research development and
methodology development for students. It has therefore earned its keep, and
it has been very successful in selling Molybdenum-99 and doped silicon.
This has earned just as much revenue as Government gives to them.

We have spent about R3 million of the Innovation Fund money on technology
support for crime prevention. We have investigated improving a gun pistol
or any other automatic weapon in such a way that it is regulated through a
chip. It can identify a biometric identification so that only the owner of
the gun can fire it through these biometric tests. In other words, one
needs to put one's thumb print on a special receptor which will be
electronically conveyed to the control mechanism before one can fire the
gun. We think that if we can develop this type of technology, which will be
a first in the world - and the work on it is continuing - we could combat a
lot of crime in this country. [Applause.]

We look forward to a dedicated discussion with the portfolio committee
regarding the issues raised by Mr Cassim because there are lots of
synergies that we will gain out of joint management of the Arts, Culture,
Science and Technology expenditures. There should be levels of
accountability concerning these expenditures, not only in terms of the
Public Finance Management Act, but also in terms of accountability to the
people of this country. The portfolio committee will become a very
important partner in monitoring that expenditure and in exacting that
accountability.

I would like to mention the Human Sciences Research Council, which I feel
we did not mention sufficiently. There has been a new leadership at this
council. They are very involved in HIV/Aids research, and for this reason
they have appointed Prof Olive Shisana, the former Director-General of the
Department of Health, who went on to become Professor of Public Health at
Medunsa. She is now with the Human Sciences Research Council, heading the
HIV/Aids research team. We realise that it is not just about the immune
system only. It is not only about vaccines and drugs, but also about human
behaviour. If we can understand, through effective study and research, the
human determinants of behaviour and how those determinants can be modified
through messages and education, we would have done a great deal to combat
this scourge.

As I have said, I would also like to point out the fact that we are not yet
ready with the Language Policy and Plan for South Africa. We took the
document to Cabinet and it was quite clear that to establish language units
in every department would involve a mechanism whereby each and every person
who writes to a department is answered in his or her own language. This is
a critical part of our democratic development. We need these language units
in every department, but the costing of setting them up was clearly not
done properly. Therefore the national Treasury is busy with this process.
We shall come back to Parliament, probably around September, once Cabinet
has adopted our proposals and the costing by the national Treasury has been
done to finalise the language plan.

It is not as if it is in the doldrums, it is an active process that is
going on. Obviously it is protracted because of the very nature of language
in a multilingual society such as ours. We need all types of provisions so
that it is equitable, fair, and complies with the mandates given in the
Constitution.
On the whole, I think this has been a very good debate. I am very happy
that there has been so much interest. Normally, in any budget debate there
is a lot of heckling, but in this one there was no heckling. This is a sign
that we are all paying attention to this very serious issue of the
application of science and technology to improve our competitiveness in the
world and export revenues, and therefore should have enough money to
provide social and health services, grow our economy and create new jobs.
But, more importantly, we need to provide for community needs in the area
of arts, culture, science and technology.

I do hope that the funds from the lottery will soon be coming our way. With
those funds we can then reach out and create new centres such as halls for
the arts, schools for drama and many other activities in the communities.
This will give expression to the huge talent and creative power that we
have which comes out of the very diverse nature of our languages and
cultures.

South Africa has received people from all over the globe. It is a home for
everyone because, after all, it is the origin of humankind. I would like to
thank hon members for their support. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

                                AFRICAN UNITY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr M RAMGOBIN: Chairperson, colleagues and our children, who are the
future, the ANC is on record on the issue of transformation, that our
efforts to change people's material conditions cannot take place in a
vacuum. We go on to say that this should happen in terms of spiritual
sustenance in the form of a defining and self-assertive culture of an
emerging democratic nation.

We are going to say that it is, it is in this context that the call for an
RDP of the soul should be seen, a cultural revolution without which all the
other efforts will lose meaning and dissipate. This is in respect of our
country. Given that we are observing African Unity Day, that Africa
continues to be in urgent need of development and reconstruction, the ANC's
sensitivity on the RDP of the soul is also applicable with humility to our
continent as a whole.

It is in the spirit of this sentiment that President Thabo Mbeki pronounced
on 9 February here, in pursuance of the ANC's 8 January statement:


  Together, we must turn into reality a new internationalism that does not
  permit of the co-existence, within human society, of opulence and
  grinding poverty, of thriving modernity and dehumanising
  underdevelopment.


  ... We march into the new era of the African Century as Africans who have
  made the determination that this century will be a hundred years in which
  we cease to be victims of our circumstances but become victors.

The President went on to say:


  As we strengthen the bonds of friendship and solidarity with our fellow
  Africans, we have an obligation to help ensure, in our country and
  everywhere else on our continent, that no African child should ever again
  walk in fear of guns ...

I say, no African child should ever again walk in fear of guns.


  ... tyrants and abuse; that no African child should ever again experience
  hunger, avoidable disease and ignorance; that no African child should
  ever again feel ashamed to be an African.

In observing African Unity Day, what has to be done and how do we make this
century Africa's century? For the revitalisation of our continent, we need
the rest of the world as our partners, not as donors. In deference to this
position, Millennium Africa Plan was put on the map of the world, the World
Economic Forum, held in Davos.

Presidents Mbeki, Obasanjo and Bouteflika were tasked with the
responsibility of presenting Map as a development strategy for the
continent. In broad terms, what is the programme? At the top of this, among
other things, is the question of political governance.

The African Union has to be ceased with the responsibility that governments
are legitimate and enjoy the support of the African masses, that they are
strong enough to defend the sovereignty of the countries, that they are
able to address the developmental interests of these masses, and that they
must be able to engage with the global processes that characterise a world
economy.

The eradication of poverty, and the protection and conservation of the
physical environment are also of critical importance. In pursuing the World
Economic Forum's theme at Davos of bridging the divide, our President was
unequivocal about what was envisaged in the Marp plan to give unity to
Africa.

According to the outlines, priority areas would cover, among other things,
creating peace, security, stability and democratic governance, human
resource development; the harnessing and development of Africa's resources;
the development of infrastructure; investment in information and
communication technology; and the development of financial management and
mechanisms. To advance these goals, participating countries will form a
compact committee, committing them to the programme and a forum of leaders
will make decisions about subprogrammes and also review progress on their
implementation.

But can all this happen in a vacuum, as our President has asked. The answer
is, no. We need to address some of the vital components that will help fill
this vacuum.

In the current conditions prevailing on the continent, it is unfortunate
that belief systems, both organised and not organised, are not likely to be
of much help. Until now, and, it is hoped, for not much longer, these
systems afforded careers for what is termed, "pendants and priests." Their
objectives, by and large, were limited and did not allow for the masses of
men and women to have life in its abundance. All the institutions need to
re-examine their roles and reflect on how Africa is where it is today.

We need to be told why ubuntu, a concept which was born in the crucible of
Africa's consciousness, is no more than a platitude. We in Africa need to
contest conformity, without which the individual will be or is denied the
opportunity to develop his or her own convictions.

Schools or learning have to give rise to a society of thinkers, not
conformers to preset ideas, dogmas and rituals which divide us into unreal
circles of our own disunity. We have to consciously give rise to a
community of cultural ideas and like-mindedness in fundamental aims and
ideals. In a universe of self-perpetuation in ever-changing circumstances,
the universal spirit of self-criticism and open-mindedness, based on reason
cannot take place when more than 80% of Africa's intellectuals - her brain
power - are in Europe and America. We need to bring them back.

In many ways our leadership in the ANC, with the power of our Constitution,
is saying that Africa's women have to be liberated. We say that Africa
cannot be free for as long as one half of her keeps the other half in
bondage. We are emphasising that there is a direct link between democracy
and development.

The formation of the OAU was a declaration of faith which demanded that our
continent, governments, leaders, NGOs and others have a responsibility to
pursue policies that raise the quality of life and basic services, and that
we will collectively stop violent conflicts, proxy wars and mercenaries
aimed at the exploitation of Africa's natural resources and the constant
assault on our environment.

Today, as ever before, it is the duty of Africa's leaders to institute
transparent, legal and regulatory frameworks for all, but especially for
the financial market and auditing of private companies, individuals and the
public sectors, thus providing a hedge against corruption and all other
tendencies which have the power to corrode the souls of nations.

The challenge we are facing is to ensure that progress is characterised by
both originality and a sense of adventure. The adventure that I as an
African am arguing for in the sphere of education and consciousness, is
that education should not only enrich the minds of our people with new
knowledge, but also help us to rise to our full spiritual stature. It must
excite in us the value of spiritual realities of selflessness, and it must
steer our minds from the things which are merely temporal to the things
that are eternal.

We as Africans have to pursue ultimate values, as our ancestors did, and
should not be seized with mere utilitarian ends. The ability to co-operate
with others and to coexist with mutual forbearance is not only the true
test of education and consciousness, but also a fundamental and
foundational requirement for African unity.

I would like to give more credence to what I have been saying in the words
of the late Dr Kwame Nkrumah, when he said, and I quote:


  Thus may we take pride in the name of Africa, not out of romanticism, but
  as an inspiration for the future. It is right and proper that we should
  know about our past, for just as the future moved from the present, so
  the present has emerged from the past. Nor need we be ashamed of the
  past. There was much in it of glory. What our ancestors achieved in the
  context of the contemporary society gives us confidence that we can
  create, out of the past, a glorious future, not in terms of war and
  military pomp, but in terms of social progress and peace, for we
  repudiate war and violence.


  Our battles shall be against the old ideas that keep men trammelled in
  their own greed, against the crass stupidities that breed hatred, fear,
  and inhumanity. The heroes of our future will be those who can lead our
  people out of the stifling fog of disintegration through serfdom, into
  the valley of light where purpose, endeavour and determination will
  create a brotherhood.

[Time expired.]

Mr D K MALULEKE: Chairperson, hon members, fellow South Africans, I find it
fitting and proper to make Amilcar Cabral my entry point to the subject
under discussion today. Cabral asserts that, and I quote:


  Hope is true and well founded only when it grows out of the unity between
  action that transforms the world and critical reflections regarding the
  meaning of that action.

Hope, action and reflection run through the very fabric of Africa as a
golden thread beckoning and challenging Africa. Dreams and visions may and
should be there, giving birth to hope. But unless appropriate action and
constant reflection are in place, Africa is doomed to see elusive mirages
and thus be on a vicious circle journey to nowhere for ever.

Africa Unity Day compels us to look at our distant and recent past, not out
of nostalgia, but out of the critical reflective need to take stock of how
we as Africans have comported ourselves and conducted our affairs on this
journey to nationhood on a Pan-African scale. The turbulent fifties and
sixties could well be described as Africa's ``the best of times, the worst
of times'', or ``the three steps forward, and two steps backwards''. To use
a clichÃ©, one may ``profoundly ponder and wonder''.

In the fifties a star was born, namely Ghana, giving the entire African
continent hope of a new dawn of freedom and liberty. Ghana and many African
states since then have seen their rise and fall. Some are still reeling
punch-drunk or power-drunk to this day.

Amidst all this hope and despair a vehicle came into being in the form of
the Organisation of African Unity, OAU, hopefully not the acronym ``IOU'',
spelling out Africa's perpetual indebtedness and with cap in hand in front
of the benevolent coffers of the world's nations that are up and going. The
date 25 May 1963 is indeed a symbol of a historical beacon that rekindled
the flames of hope since the remarkable Pan-African yearning of the
nineteenth century and the earlier diaspora. In the words of Tom Boya, the
inception of the OAU can be likened to the discovery of Africa by the
Africans, ie Africa's desire to be understood and to be recognised for her
viewpoint and the perspective of her own people.

Thanks to Emperor Haile Selassie for his generosity in providing the
temporary secretariat and donating funds to them to meet the first year's
expenditure in order to kick-start the fledgling OAU. It is a great pity
for Africa that Kwame Nkrumah, Emperor Haile Selassie and others went down
as corrupt despots. The bane of Africa seems stubbornly to be corruption,
nepotism, despotism, the arrogance of the abuse of power and tribalism or
ethnicity. All these are still the albatross around Africa's neck.

Coming to the sunny side of the African street, we reflect on the
objectives of the OAU. Overall, these intentions and objections were
undeniably noble, for most represented unity and freedom in Africa. The
other objectives randomly sketched are: to promote the unity and solidarity
of African state; to co-ordinate and intensify the operation and efforts to
achieve a better life for the people of Africa; to eradicate all forms of
colonialism from Africa; to promote international co-operation, having due
regard to the Charter of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Marked principles were espoused, such as the sovereign equality of all
member states; peaceful settlement of disputes by negotiation, mediation,
conciliation and arbitration and unreserved condemnation of political
assassinations in all its forms and subversive activities on the part of
neighbouring states or any other states. The aforementioned are worthy and
noble ideas. How much has the OAU achieved? How far away from the problems
that necessitated the formation of the OAU has Africa moved? Doing things
together with a common mind and purpose is good and essential for unity and
mutual respect, including reciprocal mutual support.

Have we realised any sustainable solution to the problems that afflict us?
Sadly, it seems the answer is no. Conflict after conflict obliterates our
chances of sustainable solutions, thus pushing the attainment of peace,
stability and prosperity out of Africa's immediate reach.

Ethnic cleansing and genocide plague this continent. The catalogue of
morbid conflict is long. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia,
Eritrea, Sierra Leone, Burundi et al are sad indictments staring us in the
eye. Quo vadis, Africa? Whither, South Africa? Waarheen, Zimbabwe? U ya
kwihi, Zimbabwe?  [Where to Zimbabwe?] [Interjections.] Is it not time that
each and every African state got its act together before venturing on to
lofty ideas? Charity begins at home, before the big picture or grand
visions.

Transformation within each member state's territory needs to take place in
earnest. Getting the skeletons out of the cupboard, inculcating tolerance
within each state and relentlessly inculcating a culture of human rights
and democracy are what need to be done here and now. Poverty, corruption,
dictatorship, the flagrant abuse of power and the violation of fundamental
rights are not compatible with any form of African unity, fraternity and
renaissance. In the words of Dr Salim Ahmed Salim:


  Let this African Unity Day be truly our rededication to the elimination
  of poverty, misery and bloodshed from the continent.


  Upholding the rule of law, the freedom of speech, belief and association,
  and the unconditional respect for democratic constitutions, can ensure
  peace, stability and prosperity to Africa. Let deeds speak louder than
  words for Africa's sake and glory.]

I hope you understood exactly what I said. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, the Minister of Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology was so impressed with the members' interest
in arts and science that he wishes to enrol all of you and to invite you to
a luncheon in the Marks Building at 13:00. [Interjections.] I am sure the
hon Mr Modisenyane will say ``Vrystaat!'' to that.

Ms I MUTSILA: Chairperson, allow me to dedicate my speech to all women of
the continent of Africa, and all South African women in particular. I pay
my tribute to Sophia Pedro of Mozambique who gave birth on top of a tree
and many unsung heroines of her calibre who surrendered their lives in
order to save their children.

I salute women in Rwanda who stood firm during the genocide to save their
men, children and the nation at large during severe testing times. I salute
all women in war in stricken countries, because when two elephants fight,
the grass is trampled. Women and children are the most affected by those
wars.

Africa is one of the richest continents in minerals and many natural
resources, and yet it is rated among the poorest of the poor continents.
Why? Colonialism, apartheid and many such forces caused Africa to be what
it is today. Malnutrition and diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and
HIV/Aids, bad sanitation, illiteracy and poverty are major setbacks to
Africa's development. This is cause for the women of Africa and the nation
at large to stand up and work side by side to bring Africa back to its
rightful perspective.

Throughout Africa, poverty levels differ across different race groups and
between men and women. Approximately 60% of all black South Africans live
in poverty, compared to only 2% of whites. This difference is even larger
in rural areas. Out of all black people living in rural areas, 64% have an
income too low to enable them to afford the minimum necessary for food,
clothing and fuel.

Given this background, it is common cause for Africa to unite and fight for
a better life for all. Our President Thabo Mbeki, said, and I quote:


  Our Government will have to intensify its work to make its own
  contribution to the strengthening of the continental movement for
  reconstruction and development. As a movement, we will also work to
  strengthen our links with other progressive forces on our continent.
  Together with them, we will have to work on a programme of action focused
  of the promotion of the objectives of the African Renaissance.

Concern regarding gender justice and equality has existed at many levels.
At the political level, one of the ways in which these concerns about
injustice, violence, discrimination and inequality are being addressed, is
advocating that women become actively involved in politics and, indeed, at
all levels of decision-making.

A Government by men for men cannot claim to be a government for the people,
by the people. Women are best placed to articulate their own needs and
concerns. Women bring different styles and values to politics. One of the
resolutions taken by SADC women was networking and information-sharing in
partnership with women MPs, the national gender machinery, NGOs and other
stakeholders. Women of Africa shall unite in sensitising both men and women
from all walks of life about the fact that gender equality is a matter of
development, democracy and human rights.

When loving hands become fists, when violence and sexual crimes committed
against children and women pervade our societies, what would one do? What
would one do if one were abandoned because of circumstances surrounding
them? If one were sexually abused by an alcoholic father, raped by a gang
of sex-hungry men and forced to act in porn movies, would one give up on
life and think the worst of oneself or would one be a survivor? Women in
Africa chose to unite in order to be survivors and speak out. They are
fighting these atrocities head-on.

We are all aware that over many years it has been the women who struggled
and sacrificed in the face of the most vicious repression. Women have been
at the forefront of transforming conditions on this continent. That is why,
when men in Burundi could not negotiate peace, our former President,
Comrade Mandela, called on women in Burundi to take over the leadership.

In Africa, rural women became the victims of migrant labour, a colonial
policy designed to dehumanise and demoralise the African society. The
apartheid system for migrant labour meant strict control of black people's
movement and of where they may live and work. Black South Africans were
broken into two parts: one labour unit separated from the other, which was
a man with a family and with hopes and aspirations. Men and women could not
perform their godly given roles as husbands and wives, as mothers and
fathers and as members of the community.

In 1969, the hon Froneman, an NP MP, said, and I quote:


  African labour forces must not be burdened with superfluous appendages
  such as wives, children and dependants who could not provide service.

In 1973, the congress of the Afrikaanse Studentebond resolved that all
Bantu women and children in white areas should be shipped back to the
homelands, and that only men should be left in the white areas, as long as
they needed them. They went on to say that, and I quote:


  We do not want the Bantu women here simply as a adjunct to the
  procreative capacity of the Bantu population. A Bantu wife should be
  allowed into the town only if she were needed in the labour market.

These are the terrible and horrible atrocities which African unity seeks to
redress and rectify. The African Renaissance is yet another brick in the
ANC reconstruction and rebuilding campaign that will transform the African
continent. The ANC-led Government believes that there should be a culture
of nondiscrimination and diversity. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, I want to congratulate - and I am sure
hon members will agree with me - the hon Ms Mutsila, who brought a very
interesting dimension, namely women, into the debate. As the seven most
important people in my life are all women, that is my mother, my wife, my
three daughters and my two granddaughters, I want to promise the hon Ms
Mutsila that we will all fight with her for the rights of women.
[Applause.]
I intend to deliver my speech in Afrikaans.

President Mbeki het in 1996 sy bekende ``ek is 'n Afrikaan'' toespraak
gehou. Ek het die treffende aanhalings daaruit male sonder tal gelees en
elke keer het die Afrika-tema dieper en dieper in my siel ingetrek.

Wat my, as Afrikaner, veral diep tref van die President se woorde, is die
gedeelte wat lui ``I am the grandchild who lays fresh flowers on the Boer
graves on St Helena and the Bahamas ... I am an African''.

Ek, Koos van der Merwe, is ook 'n Afrikaan. Ek is 'n kind van Afrika,
sonder Afrika kan ek nie bestaan nie. Daarom wil ek Afrika graag vandag
besing en sy lof prys. Ek doen dit in een van die 2Â 000 tale en dialekte
wat in Afrika gepraat word. Ek praat in 'n taal wat juis in Afrika
ontstaan, gevorm en gegiet is. My moedertaal is die enigste Afrikataal wat
in sy naam erkenning aan Afrika gee - Afrikaans.

Wanneer ek soggens Parlement toe ry en saans terug, sing ek soms ``ken jy
die land waar die Boerevolk woon, land met sy berge terrasse gekroon, land
met sy ruimtes so wyd en so vry, ai, dis die land, dis die wÃªreld vir my''.

Ja, President Mbeki, ek is ook 'n Afrikaan, ek swem graag in die
vriendelike Zuluwaters van die Indiese Oseaan van KwaZulu-Natal. Ek sit
gereeld op Tafelberg en kan nie genoeg staar na die mooiste kaap van alle
kape nie. Ek ry deur die eensame leegheid van die Vrystaat en doen my
diepste dinkwerk daar.

Ek bring soveel moontlik gehaltetyd deur in die Bosveld om die kampvuur
waar mens nooit genoeg kry van die reuk van die hardekoolvuur en die
dansende figure in die vlamme nie, waar mens jou verbeel jy sien in die
vlamme hoe Mabalel dans met die klingelinge wat haar enkelringe vergesel.
Ek probeer nog steeds my Sesotho sa Borwa [Southern Sesotho] verbeter sodat
ek lekker met my Sotho-vriende kan kuier, vernaam Gertrude Mzizi, Sotho-
prinses.

Ek besing graag my land Afrika, veral ``by Rietfontein se leidam waar die
reier staan en droom en gepluimde peerboomtakke bloeisels sprinkel in die
stroom''. Ja, dan besing ons almal Afrika, ``ek sing van die wind wat te
keer gaan, ek sing van die reÃ«n wat daar val, ek sing van ons vaal ou
Karooland, van blomme wat bloei by die wal''.

Langs die snoesige kampvuur, met 'n ribbetjie op die gloeiende kole, hoor
ek in die verte iemand sing. Hy sing so pragtig, hy sing van tevredenheid
met Afrika. Hy sing ``op my ou ramkietjie met nog net een snaar, speel ek
in die maanskyn deurmekaar. Wat gee ek om as die mense sÃª ek is mal, as die
varings my aanhoor by die wal?''

Afrika is ons vader. Afrika is ons moeder. Sonder Afrika is ons almal
weeskinders. Ons is in Afrika geanker. Ons huise is op die rots Afrika
gebou, soos H A Fagan se uitdaging ``kom nag, kom weer en wind, kom oseaan;
dit is 'n rots waarop my huisie staan''.

Ek is al dikwels gevra wat my dan hier in Afrika hou as soveel van ons
mense reeds uit die land padgee. Dan antwoord ek met 'n Duitse lied, met
erkenning aan die digter van die Suidwesterlied, ``en sou iemand ons vra,
wat hou ons dan hier vas; dan kan ons maar net sÃª, ons bemin Afrika''.

Ons praat vandag oor eenheid in Afrika. Wanneer 'n mens na diÃ© uitdaging
kyk, word jy egter yskoud, want dit lyk na 'n totaal onbegonne taak. Daar
woon meer as 800 miljoen mense in Afrika. Teen die jaar 2020 sal daar sowat
1,7 miljard mense in Afrika wees. Daar is 53 state, met meer as 2Â 000 tale
en dialekte. Sedert 1952 was daar 85 gewelddadige of ongrondwetlike
regeringsveranderings, en 90 regeringsleiers is afgesit.

Sedert die jare 60 het 25 presidente en eerste ministers gesterf. Sedert
1970 is meer as 30 oorloÃ« geveg, meestal burgeroorloÃ«. Agt miljoen mense is
uit hul land verdryf. Die lewensverwagting van sub-Sahara-Afrika is maar 48
jaar. Sewentig persent van alle HIV-positiewes leef in Afrika, en so kan ek
voortgaan, op 'n baie tragiese noot.

Wat is dan die boodskap? Die boodskap is dat die pad van Afrika-eenheid
baie steil en vol dorings is, dat Afrika se realiteit nie eenheid, vrede en
voorspoed is nie; nee, Afrika se realiteite is veel eerder wrede verdeling,
oorlog, bloedvergieting, armoede en siekte. Niks moet ons egter stuit in
ons strewe om Afrika op te hef nie.

Ook ons Afrikaners ken Afrika se realiteit van verdeeldheid en sy pad van
bloed. Ons is deel van die stryd tot die dood toe van broer teen broer. In
1914 het ons mekaar in 'n bloedig rebellie beveg en een van ons leiers,
Jopie Fourie, is deur 'n vuurpeloton tereggestel. Daardie tragiese voorval
het 'n digter laat skryf ``daar trek 'n koeÃ«l met spoed, met spoed, hy's
nat van Afrikanerbloed, hy kom uit Afrikanerroer, hy trek deur
Afrikanerhart, en smart die boodskap wat hy voer''.

Ons Afrikaners het ook vrede in Afrika gesoek en ons digters het gehelp om,
soos volg, vrede te soek en te kry: ``daar sal ek vrede weer besef, waar
Thebes in die stil woestyn sy magtig rotskruin hoog verhef en Mara in die
sand verdwyn''.

Die IVP erken dat Afrika se pad na eenheid baie moeilik is, maar ons glo
dit is nie 'n onmoontlike taak nie. Ons glo ons moet 'n meesterplan beraam
om 'n einde aan alle konflikte te maak en politieke stabiliteit te
verseker. Ons moet Afrika-oplossings nastreef, ons moet vrede maak met ons
geskiedenis, 'n geskiedenis van slawerny, kolonialisme, rassisme, politieke
onverdraagsaamheid, oorlog en bloedvergieting.
Vassteek by die verlede, gaan ons sekerlik nie help nie. Ons moet die
toekoms aanpak met krag en entoesiasme en met selfversekerheid, oortuiging
en toewyding. Ons moet President Mbeki se millenniumplan vir Afrika
ondersteun. Ons moet die Suid-Afrikaanse vredesresep na Afrika uitvoer, ons
wat wrede verdeeldheid, bloedige stryd, haat en wraak, met ernstige
onderhandelings, in sukses omgeskakel het.

Laat ons dan in ons strewe na Afrika-eenheid, soos volg, almal saam met die
volksdigter Langenhoven sing: ``op jou roep sÃª ons nooit nee nie, sÃª ons
altyd, altyd ja, met ons land en met ons nasie sal dit wel wees, God
regeer'' en Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[In 1996 President Mbeki made his ``I am an African'' speech. I read the
striking quotations in it many times and each time the African theme crept
deeper and deeper into my soul.

What made a special impression on me as an Afrikaner was the part of the
President's words that went: ``I am the grandchild who lays fresh flowers
on the Boer graves on St Helena and the BahamasÃ¿.Ã¿.Ã¿. I am an African''.
I, Koos van der Merwe, am also an African. I am a child of Africa, without
Africa I cannot exist. That is why I want to praise Africa today. I am
doing so in one of the 2 000 languages and other dialects that are spoken
in Africa. I am speaking a language that originated, was moulded and cast
in Africa. My mother tongue is the only language of Africa that recognises
Africa in its name - Afrikaans.

When I drive to and from Parliament in the morning and evening, I sometimes
sing ``ken jy die land waar die Boerevolk woon, land met sy berge terasse
gekroon, land met sy ruimtes so wyd en so vry, ai, dis die land, dis die
wÃªreld vir my''.

Yes, President Mbeki, I am also an African, I take pleasure in swimming in
the friendly Zulu waters of the Indian Ocean off KwaZulu-Natal. I regularly
sit on top of Table Mountain and cannot get my fill of staring at the
fairest cape of all capes. I drive through the lonely desolation of the
Free State and there I do my deepest thinking.

I spend as much as possible quality time at the campfire in the Bushveld,
where one can never get enough of the fragrance of the hardwood fire and
the dancing figures in the flames, where one imagines seeing Mabalel
dancing in the flames, accompanied by the tinkling of her ankle rings. I am
still trying to improve my Sesotho sa Borwa [Southern Sotho] so that I
could have wonderful conversations with my Sotho friends, especially
Gertrude Mzizi, Sotho princess.

I take pleasure in singing about my country, Africa, particularly: ``by
Rietfontein se leidam waar die reier staan en droom en gepluimde
peerboomtakke bloeisels sprinkel in die stroom''. Yes, then we all sing to
Africa: ``ek sing van die wind wat te keer gaan, ek sing van die reÃ«n wat
daar val, ek sing van ons vaal ou Karooland, van blomme wat bloei by die
wal''.

Next to the cosy campfire, with a rack of ribs on the glowing coals, I hear
someone singing in the distance. He is singing so beautifully. He is
singing about his satisfaction with Africa. He is singing: ``Op my ou
ramkietjie met nog net een snaar, speel ek in die maanskyn deurmekaar. Wat
gee ek om as die mense sÃª ek is mal, as die varings my aanhoor by die
wal?''

Africa is our father. Africa is our mother. Without Africa we are all
orphans. We are anchored in Africa. Our houses have been built on the rock,
Africa, as H A Fagan challenges: ``Kom nag, kom weer en wind, kom oseaan -
dit is 'n rots waarop my huisie staan''.

I have often been asked what keeps me here in Africa when so many of our
people have already left the country. Then I reply with a German song, with
acknowledgement to the poet of the SÃ¼dwesterlied: ``Ã¿.Ã¿.Ã¿. en as iemand ons
sou vra, wat hou ons dan hier vas; dan kan ons maar net sÃª, ons bemin
Afrika''.

We are talking about unity in Africa today. When one looks at this
challenge, however, one's blood runs cold, because it seems to be an
impossible task. Over 800 million people live in Africa. By the year 2020
there will be about 1,7 billion people in Africa. There are over 53 states,
with more than 2 000 languages and dialects. Since 1952 there have been 85
violent or unconstitutional changes of government, and 90 government
leaders have been deposed.

Since the sixties 25 presidents and prime ministers have died. Since 1970
more than 30 wars have been fought, mostly civil wars. Eight million people
have been driven from their countries. The life expectancy of sub-Saharan
Africa is a mere 48 years. Seventy percent of all those who are HIV
positive live in Africa and I can continue in this very tragic vein.

What is the message, then? The message is that the path to African unity is
very steep and strewn with thorns, that the reality of Africa is not unity,
peace and prosperity, no, Africa's realities are much more probably
division, war, bloodshed, poverty and disease. Nothing should stop us in
our endeavour to uplift Africa.

We Afrikaners also know Africa's reality of division and its path of blood.
We are part of the struggle to the death between brother and brother. In
1914 we fought one another in a bloody rebellion and one of our leaders,
Jopie Fourie, was executed by a firing-squad. That tragic event inspired a
poet to write: ``daar trek 'n koeÃ«l met spoed, met spoed, hy's nat van
Afrikanerbloed, hy kom uit Afrikanerroer, hy trek deur Afrikanerhart, en
smart die boodskap wat hy voer''.

We Afrikaners also pursued peace in Africa and our poets helped to seek
peace and to find it: ``daar sal ek vrede weer besef, waar Thebes in die
stil woestyn sy magtig rotskruin hoog verhef en Mara in die sand verdwyn''.

The IFP admits that Africa's road to unity is very difficult, but we do not
believe that it is an impossible task. We believe that we must devise a
master plan to put an end to all conflicts and ensure political stability.
We must pursue African solutions, we must make peace with our history, a
history of slavery, colonialism, racism, political intolerance, war and
bloodshed.

Getting stuck in the past will certainly not help us. We must tackle the
future with strength and enthusiasm and with self-confidence, conviction
and dedication. We must support President Mbeki's millennium plan for
Africa, we must export the South African recipe for peace to Africa, we,
who transformed cruel division, bloody struggle, hatred and revenge into
success by means of serious negotiations.

Let us then pursue African unity as follows. Sing along with the people's
poet Langenhoven: ``op jou roep sÃª ons nooit nee nie, sÃª ons altyd, altyd
ja, met ons land en met ons nasie sal dit wel wees, God regeer'' and Nkosi
sikelel' iAfrika. [Applause.]]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members will agree that the hon
Koos has it in him to become a more than useful poet.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson ...

An HON MEMBER: Do not talk about Cuba.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, my geography is not that bad. I know Cuba
is not on the continent of Africa. [Laughter.]

Die agb lid Koos van der Merwe is reg, Afrika se verskeidenheid is sy
grootste rykdom. Die probleem is net dat hierdie verskeidenheid nie altyd
erken word nie, en ek sal daarna terugkom tydens my toespraak. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The hon member Koos van der Merwe is right, Africa's diversity is its
greatest wealth. The problem is only that this diversity is not always
recognised, and I will return to this issue during my speech.]

The Financial Times described Africa as a snakes-and-ladders board, with
the snakes marked "famine or flood, corruption and coup," and ladders
marked "ceasefire, peace pact, foreign investment and multiparty
elections". Let us hope for Africa's sake that the ladders will beat the
snakes, that the ups will beat the downs; if not, African unity will be out
of the question.

The ups will beat the downs when senseless conflicts that plague the
continent are brought to an end. During the last decade Africa suffered
from five major conflicts per year, peaking at 11 major conflicts in 1998.
The root causes of these conflicts will have to be addressed. The question
is: Should Africa, at the dawn of a new century, not reconsider its
arbitrary colonial barriers which have triggered many conflicts on the
continent? The conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea is a case in point.

Ethnicity is a further major contributor to conflicts on the continent. As
a matter of fact, the root cause of virtually every prevailing conflict on
the continent is violation of the rights of people belonging to ethnic,
religious and linguistic minorities by majority governments.
The time has come for Africa to take the United Nations Declaration on the
Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic
Minorities seriously. Closer to home, a special effort should be made to
end the conflict in Angola, which impacts negatively on the economic
development of this region. Angola is a country with enormous economic
potential. If the war were to stop, Angola could attract as much as R4
trillion in oil-related investment, with important spin-offs for the entire
region. Instead of concentrating on peace efforts in the Middle East, the
Great Lakes area and Western Africa, no matter how important peace in these
regions may be, South Africa should spend its time and energy on ending the
war in Angola.

I can think of nobody better than former President Nelson Mandela to take
the initiative. If he can pull off a peace deal in Burundi, why not in
Angola? Nobody will invest in a conflict-torn region. No wonder Africa
South of the Sahara gets less than 1% of direct foreign investment. Unless
the conflict is brought to an end, African unity will remain a pipe dream.

The ups will beat the downs when Africa changes the face of its leadership.
Authoritative opinion agrees that power-drunk leaders who tolerate no
opposition within or without party ranks, and who use the power of the
state to interfere in party-political matters, damage investor confidence.
Hopefully the House will therefore understand the concern of the opposition
when the Minister of Safety and Security named three prominent ANC leaders
in respect of a so-called plot against the hon President. [Interjections.]

In Zambia a cabinet Minister's arm was broken when he objected against a
third term for Chiluba. Dapo Oyewole pointed out that the recurrent blunder
of African societies is that they think that good revolutionaries will make
good leaders. According to him, these revolutionaries often lack the
pertinent knowledge and skills necessary to manage the social economic
affairs of the state. If leaders who govern for the good of the people
rather than for themselves come to the fore, the bad experience of 40 years
will be something of the past and African unity will become a reality.
[Interjections.]

The ups will beat the downs in Africa if Africa can get free access to
world markets. Free access to the markets of the industrialised countries
would result in growth worth billions of rands per year for Africa.
European restrictions on the import of food from Africa annually block
agricultural products worth $700 million from entering their countries.
Government-subsidised agricultural products makes it extremely difficult
for Africa to compete on an equal footing. The Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development spent more than R2 300 billion on agricultural
subsidies. That is the equivalent of the total gross national product of
Africa south of the Sahara.

A taxi driver in London told Kaizer Nyatsumba: ``I have always said that
Africa could feed the world if it was properly managed, and that would be
good for Africa itself and for the rest of the world.'' That is indeed
true, but Africa must be given a fair chance to compete on world markets.
In this regard South Africa cannot preach to others. We will also have to
lower our tariffs, and import more from Africa. South Africa's imports from
the rest of Africa decreased from R1,7 billion for the period 1997-98, to
R980 million for the period 1998-99.
The ups will beat the downs when debt relief becomes a reality. Africa's
debt amounted to $310 billion in 1997, and this exceeds the total value of
goods and services produced by the continent.

Daar is een voorwaarde aan verbonde. Die geld wat beskikbaar kom as gevolg
van die afskryf van skuld, moet aangewend word vir armoedeverligting.
Afrika moet verenig, nie teen die Noorde of industriÃ«le lande nie, maar in
hulle strewe om konflikte uit te roei, armoede te bekamp en in hulle strewe
om deel van die wÃªreldhandel te word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[There is one condition attached to this. The money which is made available
as a result of the cancellation of debt should be applied for poverty
relief. Africa should unite, not against the North or industrial countries,
but in their struggle to eradicate conflict, to fight poverty and in their
pursuit to become part of world trade.]

It is unacceptable that 16 states have yet to ratify the treaty which
established the African Union. Hopefully, they will do so in the near
future. [Applause.]

Ms M M MAUNYE: Mr Chairperson, comrades, hon members, for Africa to enjoy
the full benefits of its resources, it must be prepared to claim its place
and rise above the raging conflicts, poverty and underdevelopment.

The Organisation of African Unity is a reflection of the vision of the
African leaders. The continent was ruled by colonial powers, and therefore
Africans had to meet the challenge of liberating themselves. The liberation
of South Africa in 1994 was the end of colonialism on the continent. The
defeat of the NP and the defeat of white supremacy in the 1994 elections
was a clear indication from our people that they would not be led by
foreign powers any more.

From 1963 to date, Africa and the world have undergone tremendous changes.
When the OAU was founded, African soil was used by superpowers as a filter
in order to test the success of their policies. The continent was viewed as
an important sphere of success of the superpowers and their objectives. As
a result of the conflict, the development of the continent and its people
was sacrificed.

Parliaments passed protocols creating the African Union and the African
Parliament. This was possible because of the unsung success of the OAU. The
OAU succeeded in uniting the African people to fight for their total
liberation. Despite this success, new challenges emerged, such as
globalisation, information technology, preventable diseases and HIV/Aids.
Because of underdevelopment, these challenges found the continent
unprepared.

The Marp programme must be supported by everyone because it seeks to change
the balance of forces in the continent. Only collective action by the
continent will ensure that the world recognises its responsibility to the
continent.

The African Union represents the continuation of the dreams and aspirations
of the founding fathers of the OAU. These dreams were based on the
understanding that African countries and their people share a common
destiny.

We will only be able to achieve sustainable growth, development and social
progress if we act together as a continent. In March this year, South
Africa signed the Constitutive Act of the African Union in Sirte. The
signing was a demonstration of our commitment as South Africa to the
African Renaissance. Military juntas, like that in the Comoros, were barred
from participating because of Africa's resolve not to accept undemocratic
governments.

This continent is the first to create a body for parliamentarians to
discuss common continental concerns. This is a positive development. Our
country has the honour of hosting the last summit of the OAU, which will
give birth to the African Union. This is very significant in that our
country is recognised as a fully fledged member of this great continent and
is at the forefront of Africa's intention to liberate herself.

The focus of this African Union will be, among other things, to promote
democratic principles, popular participation and good governance; to
promote sustainable social and cultural development; to promote the
integration of African economics; to raise the living standards of African
people and to co-ordinate and harmonise the policies between the existing
and future regional economic communities.

One fundamental principle of the union is the promotion of gender equality.
We are confident that women will be represented in all organs of the union.
This is critical to our struggle for the all-round development of African
people. The Millennium Africa Recovery Programme will provide the way and
the route to realising what is enshrined in the Constitutive Act of the
African Union.

We hope that through the African Union, African people will take ownership
of the continent and its development, and work towards the implementation
of Marp. On 8 January the ANC said:


  The achievement of all the goals of the African Renaissance, the African
  Century, require that we transform ours into a continent of democracy;
  respect for human rights of all our people, of peace and stability.

In conclusion, we should not fail to recognise and affirm the role and
commitment of President Mbeki, in his Government, to the cause of Africa.
It is our fervent wish and daily prayer that all the sweat and time our
President invests in this project will be based on the sweet fruits of
liberation. Equally, we must recognise and acknowledge the leading role the
ANC is taking in this regard.

We say, ``Well done. Do more.'' Now is the time for Africa to unite and
take its rightful place. [Applause.]

Mr M E MABETA: Mr Chairperson and hon members, in the limited time at my
disposal I will just make a few comments without reading from my script.

Firstly, I want to explain what the OAU is not. Secondly, I want to explain
what African unity means and what role South Africa can play. Thirdly, I
would like to explain what challenges there are for right-minded South
Africans in helping the vision of the OAU, African unity and South Africa's
role.

Ms N E HANGANA: Underline the words ``right-minded South Africans''.

Mr M E MABETA: Despite it weaknesses, the OAU as an offspring of Pan-
Africanism has been spectacularly successful in becoming, in theory and
substance, the institutionalisation of the ideal of African unity. It is
understandably weak in some key areas, not because it is a government, but
because of the objective conditions that have shaped the sociopolitical
structures of the countries that came together to form the OAU. It is
because of actions and interests of states such as the old apartheid South
Africa that we have African states that are unable to play their proper
role in forging an African unity. [Interjections.]

The strength of the OAU lies in the fact that it provided both the moral
and the political foundation for the inception of the ideal of African
unity. This has been possible at this point in time because of the success
of the liberation movements in our continent to create a solid base from
which to challenge the eating habits of the industrialised countries.

South Africa's role in all of this is to spearhead efforts in the domestic
transformation of the countries that are member states of the OAU, and
which will tomorrow be full member states of the African Union and the
African Parliament. This is why, for example, all right-minded South
Africans appreciate the role played by our leaders who have successfully
initiated the basis for negotiations amongst the contending political
parties in the Great Lakes, Burundi and all over our continent.

I am, in fact, saddened by the fact that instead of praising or regretting
the memories of Steve Biko, someone spends time talking about, for example,
a broken arm in Zambia.

The important challenge for us as South Africans is simply to nurture and
support those institutions that are geared towards advancing the
development of an institutional framework so that the different organs of
an African Parliament can effectively work against repeating the weaknesses
of the OAU. [Time expired.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Mr Chairperson, the challenges to African unity and the
continent are not new; they have just taken different forms.

African unity is still threatened by wars, old and new. African unity is
still threatened by poverty and disease caused by old and new origins.
African unity is still threatened by foreign domination and old enemies
with new tactics. African unity is still threatened by corrupt leadership,
some old and others new in the trade. African unity is still threatened by
dictators and despots who simply refuse to leave office with impunity. The
usual excuse is that the people themselves are calling on these leaders to
remain in office.

But all is not doom and failure. The Millennium Africa Recovery Plan,
spearheaded by the leaders of South Africa, Nigeria and Algeria has brought
about a ray of hope, despite the obvious challenges it faces. What is
significant with Map is that Africans themselves are the authors and
implementers of the plan. We must all unite behind this plan and do what we
can to support it in order to ensure its success. We must unite against
countries which still regard the issue of slavery and reparations as a
legal issue, and not a human rights subject. We must unite against
religious intolerance; we must unite on common issues and leave divisive
issues for further debate. Mayibuye iAfrika! [Come back, Africa!]
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, dis gepas dat ons vandag op Afrika-
eenheidsdag 'n debat oor Afrika-eenheid in hierdie Huis hou. Die VF het
reeds by herhaling ons verbintenis teenoor die vasteland van Afrika betuig.
Ons is van Afrika en ons toekoms is hier.

Voor my huis is daar 'n vlagpaal waar daar elke dag 'n ander vlag wapper.
Vandag is dit die beurt van die OAE-vlag. Die onderwerp van die debat
vandag is Afrika-eenheid. Die vraag is: wat presies beteken die begrip
Afrika-eenheid? Praat ons van eenheid ter wille van eenheid of wat wil ons
maak met Afrika-eenheid nadat ons dit bereik het? Feit is, wat ook al onder
die begrip Afrika-eenheid verstaan word, daardie eenheid gaan nie sommer
maklik bereik word nie. Die Koue Oorlog, die oorlog tussen Oos en Wes is
verby, maar daar is 'n nuwe, veel ernstiger oorlog, naamlik 'n ekonomiese
oorlog tussen groot ekonomiese blokke: die EU, Nafta, die Asian Tigers en
Japan in die Verre Ooste.

Die tragedie is dat ons vasteland nie deel is hiervan nie. Die vraag is:
hoekom nie? Die antwoord: omdat Afrika nie 'n ernstige rolspeler in die
wÃªreldekonomie is wat ernstig opgeneem moet word as 'n faktor nie. Die
ideaal van Afrika-eenheid is goed en reg en ons steun dit, maar dit sal nie
bereik word as Afrika nie dramatiese veranderinge aanbring en ondergaan
nie, veranderinge op ekonomiese gebied, maatskaplike en sosiale gebied,
maar ook op politieke en demokratiese gebied.

Dit sal kom deur die erkenning van verskeidenheid en die akkommodering
daarvan, want ``een mens, een stem'' binne Afrika se bestaande arbitrÃªre
koloniale grense bring nie noodwendig demokrasie nie, maar loop in baie
gevalle uit op tirannie van meerderheidsgroepe en meerderhede wat dit
misbruik en minderhede onderdruk, wat lei tot konflik, wat 'n uitwerking
het op ekonomiese groei, en Afrika is derhalwe nie 'n rolspeler nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Mr Chairman, it is fitting that today, on Africa Unity Day,
we are having a debate in this House about African unity. The FF has
already repeatedly expressed our commitment to the continent of Africa. We
are from Africa and our future is here.

There is a flagpole in front of my house and I fly a different flag every
day. Today it is the turn of the OAU flag. The subject of today's debate is
African unity. The question is: Exactly what does African unity mean? Are
we speaking about unity for the sake of unity, or what we want to do with
African unity after we have achieved it? The fact is that whatever African
unity is understood to mean, that unity will not be achieved very easily.
The Cold War, the war between East and West, is over, but there is a new,
much more serious war, namely an economic war between big economic blocs:
the EU, Nafta, the Asian Tigers and Japan in the Far East.

The tragedy is that our continent is not part of this. The question is: Why
not? The answer: Because Africa is not a serious role-player in the world
economy which has to be taken seriously as a factor. The ideal of African
unity is good and right and we support it, but it will not be achieved if
Africa does not effect and undergo dramatic changes, changes in the
economic sphere, in the social welfare sphere, but also in the political
and democratic sphere.

This will come about through the recognition of diversity and its
accommodation, because ``one person, one vote'' within the existing
arbitrary colonial borders of Africa does not necessarily bring democracy,
but in many cases leads to tyranny by majority groups and majorities
abusing it and oppressing minorities, which leads to conflict, which
impacts on economic growth, and for this reason Africa is not a role-
player.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, 21 May this year marks the 43rd observance of
Africa Liberation Day. This day was set aside by a Pan-Africanist, Kwame
Nkrumah of Ghana, on the occasion of the first conference of the then only
8 independent African states held in Accra on 15 April 1958. May 25, in
1963, was proclaimed by the founding fathers of the Organisation of African
Unity as Africa Liberation Day in Ethiopia.

Africa Liberation Day is a revolutionary institution. It emphasises the
primacy of Africa and emerges from the relentless and long, but incomplete
struggle of the African people, to reverse the imperialist gains of the
Berlin Conference, which partitioned Africa like wedding cake for colonial
powers, making the African continent a British Africa, French Africa,
Portuguese Africa, Italian Africa, German Africa and Belgian Africa. The
colonialists looted Africa's wealth, exploited Africa's workers, and
underdeveloped Africa.

On the 43rd Africa Liberation Day all martyrs of Africa's freedom must be
remembered. Many of them were executed by colonialist forces or massacred.
Some died in many battles of liberation and were never properly buried. But
it is clear that no force on earth can defeat the Pan-African idea, without
which Africans cannot regain their lost power. Pan-Africanism is an
imperative response to the imperialist forces and their agents who have
tried hard to kill this political African philosophy.

The PAC is heartened by the gains of the Pan-Africanist movement which are
now resulting in the establishment of the Pan-African Parliament and the
African Union. Africa Liberation Day ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr R H DAVIES: Chairperson, regional economic integration has long been
central to the quest for African unity.

The first generation of independent African leaders understood very clearly
that colonialism had left them with the heritage of fragmented small
economies, tied into a global division of labour as producers of cheap raw
materials. These leaders recognised that the promotion of economic unity
was fundamental to the realisation of the objectives of growth and
development. This objective remains enshrined in the major policy documents
of the OAU, shortly to become the African Union.

The treaty of the African Union, which we ratified in this Parliament a
little while ago, calls for processes of promoting economic integration in
the subregions of our continent as a step towards realising the goal of an
African economic community.

Much has changed since the goals of African economic integration were first
sketched out in the 1960s. But I want to argue that the promotion of
regional economic integration has, if anything, become more rather than
less imperative in our current circumstances.

We live in an era known as globalisation. This is a process of rapid
integration of national capital, commodity, and, perhaps, skilled labour
markets into single global markets operating under multilateral rules. This
has been associated with the transition from an international to a
multinational mode of operation of the world economy, and also with what
Manuel Castells has called a transition to globally networked capitalism.

It has been a highly an uneven and unequal process. An article in the
recent edition of The Economist by Robert Wade cited a number of recent
studies, including one conducted within the World Bank, to argue that, and
I quote:


  ... global inequality is worsening rapidly.

One interesting feature which we are witnessing is the strengthening of
regionalisation within globalisation. While the theoretical literature has
long argued that weaker economies have much to gain from regional
integration within globalisation, the truth that we are seeing in the world
today in practice is that the stronger economies are forming themselves
into powerful regional blocs.

The European Union is on the verge of enlarging itself by incorporating a
number of countries in Eastern Europe. We have more recently seen the
signature of the FTA of the Americas. In these circumstances, I believe
that we need to underscore the fact that the promotion and strengthening of
regional integration in areas of Africa and in the south in general, is not
an optional extra but an absolute imperative.

The ANC, as a liberation movement, has, of course, been part of the
processes of determining the African vision long before we came into
Government in this country. Our involvement in these processes gave us a
strong appreciation of the continental imperatives and also of the
processes in progress on the continent. This enabled us to take firm
decisions when we finally we ended up in Government.

One such decision was a decision taken within a few months of the
installation of our democratic Government in 1994 to become part of the
Southern African Development Community. I think we need to appreciate that
that decision was, in fact, rather controversial. There was considerable
skepticism in the ranks of powerful economic forces of the old order about
whether, in fact, we were part of Africa at all. There were advisors and
experts associated with the previous regime that were advising the new
Government to stand aloof from organisations like SADC and to impose strong
conditions on our becoming members.

I am glad to say that we did not accept that advice. The fact that we did
not do so enabled us to become part of important processes in the Southern
African region. The fact that we got into SADC at the time that we did
enabled us to play a very important part in the evolution of the SADC Trade
Protocol. We were able to exercise our influence to ensure that that
protocol moved in the direction of providing for a process of negotiations
within a trade negotiating forum. We were also able to become a voice
arguing for the principle of asymmetry, in other words, a greater opening
up of the stronger economies should be a feature of the SADC Trade
Protocol. That trade protocol is now in place, and I believe that it will
make a significant contribution to equalising the trade relations which we
have in the Southern African region.

SADC has long emphasised the concept of developmental integration, and this
means two important principles. Firstly, it means recognising that we are
dealing with economies of different sizes and levels of development, and
therefore need to resist the temptation of polarisation which is inherent
in such a situation. I believe the asymmetry in the trade protocol goes
somewhere towards addressing that concern.

Secondly, the concept of developmental integration means recognising that
the barriers to intraregional trade are not necessarily only or even
primarily tariff regulations or other forms of regulatory barriers, but
also arise from the fact that what we have in our region is underdeveloped
infrastructure and inadequate production structures.

Almost all studies of regional integration in Southern Africa have
concluded that what we need is not trade integration in isolation, but a
programme incorporating sectoral co-operation, policy co-ordination and
trade integration that is capable of promoting development-oriented growth
in our region. SADC has itself long defended such a programme of sectoral
co-operation and, indeed, during its first decade this was a major focus of
its activities.

What has been clear is that this aspect of the programme has not been as
effective as we would have liked it to have been. A report to an
extraordinary summit of SADC which was held in Windhoek last month said
that only 20% of the present portfolio of projects will meet the criteria
of being priority regional projects and that most of these were dependent
on diminishing donor support. This is not to say that we do not have
progress in implementing sectoral co-operation. The cross-border Strategic
Development Initiatives have been important projects, but have operated on
a bilateral or trilateral basis.

I am pleased to see that at that summit SADC took some important decisions
on institutional reform in order to strengthen its capacity to address
these issues. The summit agreed to initiate a regional indicative strategic
development planning process and to rationalise the 19 sector co-ordinating
units into four directorates concerned with economic co-operation and
integration as well as the restructuring of the organ on defence and
security co-operation.

Our efforts in promoting regional economic co-operation are not confined to
our own region. There are important initiatives such as the binational co-
operation with Nigeria and our active engagements in continental processes;
including our hon President's role in the formulation and now the process
of generating support for the Millennium Africa Recovery Programme. We are
also involved in actively promoting the free trade agreement with the
Mercosur countries and are involved in exploratory talks with a number of
other regions in the south.

I believe that African Unity Day is a very appropriate occasion for us to
take stock of our progress in promoting economic integration. I would
conclude that we have taken some important steps, but that much remains to
be done and that many challenges still lie ahead.

I want to congratulate the Speaker for putting this debate on the
programme. I believe we need more opportunities in this Parliament to focus
on broad strategic questions like this, and not as some of the speakers in
this debate have tended to do, rapidly reduce all discussions of issues of
Africa to problems in individual countries, important though those may be.
[Applause.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÃ: Chairperson, I want to inform the previous speaker that
no matter how many communities one tries to belong to, if one does not have
unity in one's own country, one will never succeed.

Alhoewel dit wyd en syd gepropageer word, sal Afrika-eenheid nie 'n
werklikheid word indien Afrikane nie ontslae raak van hul leiers wat weier
om minderheidsgroepe te aanvaar en hul regte te eerbiedig nie. [Although it
is propagated far and wide, unity in Africa will not become a reality if
Africans do not get rid of those leaders who refuse to accept minority
groups and respect their rights.]

Once there are leaders who believe that they must, at all cost, remain in
leadership positions for 15 years or longer, so long will unity evade the
nations, regions and the African continent. While such people remain in
powerful positions in political parties, government, business or
administration, they will continue to discriminate against those who
threaten their point of view and the power base and so prevent unity.
[Interjections.]

May I also say that unity is not promoted in debates like this one where
the majority party does not allow the minority party members equal debating
time. If there is a wish to promote unity in South Africa, it must be done
through the rules and the principles of democracy. In a democracy every
member of Parliament has an equal right to put forward his party's point of
view. How can there be unity in this Parliament if this principle is
ignored?

The ANC and the IFP will not allow minorities to speak in this debate for
longer than two minutes. [Interjections.] If we seek unity, let us take the
leaf out of the history book of Europe's oldest democracy, and build our
democracy on the foundation laid by the smallest, but one of the world's
wealthiest nations on that continent, the Swiss nation.

Their unity has grown out of their desire to be one nation, with roots that
have grown out of French, German and Italian originally. These are their
official languages and their strength lies in the fact that although these
three are dominant majority parties, they have entrenched in their
Constitution the rights of the small group, the Romansch group.
[Interjections.] They realise the lesson of unity that we should follow if
we want to unite the African nations. [Interjections.] [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Deputy Chair, namhlanje ngifuna ukunibingelela egameni
lobumbano lwe-Afrika. Simunye! [today I will greet everyone in the name of
African unity. We are one!]

The MF, together with the African people, believe that identity is not
possible without unity. The Millennium Africa Programme, Map, is an
economic recovery programme for the African continent, which has as its
principal co-ordinators South Africa, Algeria and Nigeria. The idea of
African Unity Day stems from the background of Pan-Africanism, in which
visionaries interpreted African reality through literature or political
writing which inspired African political thought.

After the attempt to create African unity in the mid 90's was unsuccessful,
more than 34 countries assembled in Nigeria and signed a treaty pledging to
create an African economic community by 2005. The proposal was integral to
the establishment of a broader goal, a Pan-African caucus for the
development of the continent as a whole.

Although all this planning sounds very promising, I must express that if
the quality of leaders who form this union is not able to provide real
leadership in their nation, there will be a problem in marketing such a
forum.

The MF supports all initiative towards the African Union programme and is
confident that our people have the ability to stand united and form a
strong nation, irrespective of race, sex, colour or creed. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, 'n dominee was op 'n keer te besig met
die skape en die beeste en so aan, en diÃ© Sondag het hy toe nie 'n preek
nie. Hy vat toe 'n preek van die vorige jaar. Toe hy in die konsistorie kom
nÃ¡ die preek, sÃª die ouderling vir hom hy word lui, want hy het dieselfde
preek as die vorige jaar gelewer. Hy vra toe vir hom: ``Broer, het jy al
gedoen wat ek gesÃª het?''

So wil ek ook nou vra. Verlede jaar met hierdie selfde debat het mense soos
ek en Dr Boy Geldenhuys mooi vir die OAE en vir Afrika gepreek, maar hulle
het nog nie gedoen wat ons gesÃª het nie. Afrika klou vas aan sy probleme.
Die OAE het vier doelstellinge gehad: om eenheid te bewerkstellig, om die
vasteland te bevry van kolonialisme en apartheid, om vrede in Afrika te
bevorder en ekonomiese vooruitgang.

In die eerste twee het die OAE wel geslaag. Daar is 'n mate van eenheid,
daar is 'n organisasie, Afrika is bevry van apartheid en kolonialisme, maar
vrede het nog nie neergedaal nie, en ekonomiese voorspoed nog minder. Ons
sien dit in Angola, Mozambiek, die DRK, Brazzaville, Ruanda, Burundi,
Soedan, SomaliÃ«, EthiopiÃ«, EritriÃ«, Zimbabwe en ook in die moorde op blanke
boere in Suid-Afrika. Ons kan nog nie van vrede in Afrika praat nie.

Waarom? Daar is twee redes. Eerstens, Afrika het te behep geword met
totalitÃªre mag. Koloniale onderdrukking het plek gemaak vir Uhuru-
onderdrukking. Nkrumah het gesÃª dat 'n mens eers die koninkryk van die
politiek moet soek en dat die res sal volg. Dit werk ongelukkig nie so nie.
Staatsgrepe, eenpartystate, staatshoofde wat vir vier termyne aan bewind
bly, komplotte en gerugte van komplotte is aan die orde van die dag.

Die tweede rede is dat Afrika alles van die kolonialisme by die venster
uitgegooi het, behalwe die koloniale grense. Hierdie grense is onnatuurlike
grense. Dit plaas verskillende volke in een land bymekaar. Die meetsnoere
het nie op mooi plekke geval nie.

Afrika sal slegs vrede en stabiliteit kry as hy 'n model kan vind om
hierdie verskillende gemeenskappe wat onnatuurlik in dieselfde staatsgrense
saamgevoeg is te kan akkommodeer, deur die regte van minderhede te erken en
dit te verdiskonteer, anders gaan donker Afrika altyd 'n harde realiteit
bly. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)
[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, a minister was once so busy tending his sheep
and cattle, that on this particular Sunday he did not have a sermon ready.
He then took a sermon from the previous year. When he went into the vestry
after the sermon the elder told him that he was getting lazy because he
delivered the same sermon the previous year. His response was to ask:
``Brother, have you done what I told you to yet?''

This is the same question I now want to ask. Last year during the same
debate people like Dr Boy Geldenhuys and I preached to the OAU and Africa,
but they still have not done what we told them to. Africa is clinging to
its problems. The OAU had four goals: to effect unity, to free the
continent from colonialism and apartheid, to promote peace in Africa and
economic prosperity.

The OAU succeeded with the first two. There is a degree of unity, there is
an organisation, Africa has been freed from apartheid and colonialism, but
peace has still not descended and neither has economic prosperity. We see
this in Angola, Mozambique, the DRC, Brazzaville, Rwanda, Burundi, Sudan,
Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Zimbabwe and also in the murdering of white
farmers in South Africa. We still cannot talk about peace in Africa.

Why not? There are two reasons. Firstly, Africa is too obsessed with
totalitarian power. Colonial oppression has made way for Uhuru oppression.
Nkrumah said that one first had to seek the kingdom of politics and the
rest would follow. Unfortunately it does not work this way. Coup d'etats,
one-party states, heads of state who remain in office for four terms, plots
and rumours of plots are the order of the day.

The second reason is that Africa has jettisoned everything to do with
colonialism, except the colonial borders. These borders are unnatural
borders. They place different people together in one country. The
demarcation lines did not fall in the right places.

Africa will only find peace and stability if it can find a model to
accommodating these different communities that ware joined together within
the same state boundaries, by recognising the rights of minorities and
taking them into account, otherwise darkest Africa will always remain a
hard reality.
The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Chairperson and
members of this House, I would like us to dedicate this particular Africa
Day input to those Africans who had the vision and the courage to ensure
that we work consistently and with resilience towards African unity.

I would also like us to dedicate this input to those Africans who laid down
their lives to ensure that this continent will in future be united and
prosperous, and that we will ensure that there is freedom from all abuses
that we have experienced.

Hence, it is a challenge for us to deal with the level of Afropessimism
that exists, both in and outside the African continent. It is with great
and grave regret that we saw this Afropessimism come through in this House
today in different guises. It is sad. So, for many, in view of the
Afropessimism, South Africa was that part of Africa. A critical starting
point in overcoming Afropessimism in our country is to embrace South
Africanness and to globally embrace the Millennium Africa Recovery
Programme.

We should guard against those who wished here today to distort democracy
and project misunderstanding of what they believe democracy is and should
be. I wish that many would take their cue, quite ironically from the hon
Van der Merwe, who reflected his Africanness, not by coming with negative
sentiments, but by saying: Let us look at the positive side. We have seen
that with many others. I isolated the hon Van der Merwe because generally
the positive sentiments came from the right side of the House, but it also
came from other members.

But let me refer to Ngugi wa Thiong'o who said, and I quote:


  To decolonise our minds, we must not see our own experiences as little
  islands that are not connected with other processes.

Too many a time we assume that it is preaching, and not practice, that will
make the difference. I think we should move towards the practice, because
then we will preach, using every year's sermon and there will be no change,
for someone else is not going to do it.

So, today we should accept and acknowledge that we are inexplicably linked
to the challenges that face Africa. We are connected in identity, time and
space with Africa. We are Africans. Let us contextualise that today Africa
- the hon Mabeta made this reference as well - is a product of centuries of
slavery which constituted a massive export of cheap labour and loss of
capital. Colonialism sought to lower the cost of labour and raw materials
through direct political intervention and reduce the productive capacity by
forcing the production of cash crops and products for the colonising
countries.

There are a range of issues that need to be taken forward. The stark
realities were reflected on by various members, starting with the hon
Ramgobin. We also had hon Davies reflecting on the importance of regional
integration and so forth. Our President most aptly summarised these
realities at the Third African Renaissance Festival, as follows:


  ... that the reality that has accumulated over many centuries is that
  Africa is defined as ``of necessity, the marginalised''. This
  determination leads to actions that result in the further marginalisation
  of the continent. The more this succeeds, the more difficult it becomes
  to reverse this process of marginalisation. The difficulty includes the
  generation of significant resources from the continent itself to reverse
  this process. To bring this human tragedy to an end, it is necessary that
  the peoples of Africa gain the conviction that they are not and must not
  be wards of benevolent guardians, but the instruments of their own
  sustained upliftment.

We need to lead this process. We need to reflect that we are not the wards
of any benevolent guardians. As Africans, we must embrace the new vision
for Africa. This is an Africa free of poverty and excessive inequality; an
Africa in which peace, stability, democracy and human rights thrive; an
Africa free from environmental degradation; and an Africa thriving with
innovative human excellence, adequate infrastructure and sustainable
economic activity.

This is the vision of the Millennium Africa Recovery Plan announced by
visionary leaders such as Presidents Mbeki, Bouteflika and Obasanjo. Africa
Day should be an occasion on which we commit ourselves as African leaders
and Africans to eradicating poverty and placing our countries on the path
of sustainable growth and development.

Marp is based on a partnership approach and outlines a concrete programme.
It does not preach, but outlines a concrete programme that is multifaceted.
The key areas of the programme include creating peace, security, democratic
and good governance, with the capacity to deliver direct and sustainable
economic activity.

It reflects on investing in Africa's people through an integrated and
comprehensive human development programme. It talks to the diversification
of Africa's production and exports through expanding industrialisation in
sectors with competitive advantage, beneficiation and promoting tourism
growth. It goes on to a range of issues. We need to ensure that this
programme that focuses on creating conditions for increased investment, not
on aid for Africa, is made a reality. We need to take it forward. Therefore
Afropessimism cannot emanate from within this House.

The OAU's summit decision to usher in African unity on 26 May 2001 is a
significant initiative, and hence our debate today, as reflected by hon
Davies, is an important debate. It provides an excellent opportunity as an
African Union for socioeconomic regeneration and liberation from poverty
and human rights abuses. There are a range of initiatives, even in relation
to revitalisation of the public service on the continent, to take this
forward.

In conclusion, let me reflect on three issues from this debate today. The
three important issues are that it was essentially women in this House who
today reflected in a positive way on what is required to push back
Afropessimism, joined by progressive males and those who are willing to
contemplate progress. It was not the pessimists, it was not the
reactionaries, and it was not those clinging to the negative who came
forth. There was also a reflection today on the need for diversification
and the need to consider diversity.

I now want to remind hon Aucamp by actually making a Biblical reference on
the need for diversity and how we can bring things together in a real sense
...

... deur te gaan na die boek Rut waar Rut met haar skoonma, Naomi, gepraat
het:


  Moenie by my aandring dat ek u moet verlaat om agter u om te draai nie,
  want waar u gaan, sal ek gaan. Waar u vertoef, sal ek vertoef. U volk is
  my volk. U God is my God. Waar u sterwe, sal ek sterwe en daar begrawe
  word.


Vir ons is dit belangrik vandag om wel in aanmerking te neem dat ons een
nasie wil bou. Ons is deel van een vasteland en dit gaan ons nie help om
negatief te wees nie. Dit gaan ons nie help om pessimisties te wees. Ons
sal moet werk om daardie nasie een te maak. Gaan lees wat Rut gesÃª het.
Gaan lees en dink na oor hoe ons dit wel 'n realiteit kan maak, want umuntu
ungumuntu ngabantu. ['n Mens is 'n mens oor ander mense.] Ons is deel van
Afrika en sal dit 'n realiteit maak. [Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[... by looking at the book of Ruth, where Ruth spoke to her mother-in-law,
Naomi:


  Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: For
  whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: Thy
  people shall be my people, and thy God my God: Where thou diest, will I
  die, and there I will be buried.

To us it is important today to take into consideration that we want to
build one nation. We are part of one continent and it will not help us to
be negative. It will not help us to be pessimistic. We shall have to work
to make that nation one. Go and read what Ruth said. Go and read and
consider how we can actually make that a reality, because umuntu ngumuntu
ngabantu [a person is a person because of other people]. We are part of
Africa and we shall make that a reality.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 13:06.
