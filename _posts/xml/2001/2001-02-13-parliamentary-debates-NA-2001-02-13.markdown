                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms P N MNANDI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the people of South Africa voted an overwhelming victory
       for the ANC in last year's local government elections ...

[Interjections.]


  (2) believes that this reflects the confidence of South Africans in the
       leadership role of the ANC and its agenda of transformation;


  (3) commends and thanks the majority of our people for having voted for
       the ANC during these elections, thereby confirming that the ANC is
       the leading agent for change in South Africa; and


  (4) calls on our people to continue to actively participate ...

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr J SELFE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the exceptional performance of the Democratic Alliance in the
       local government elections of 5 December 2000 in which 1 347 DA
       councillors were elected around South Africa ...

[Interjections.]


  (2) further notes that in this election the ANC's support dropped from
       66,3% in the 1999 election to 59%, while the DA support grew from
       16,9% to 23%;


  (3) notes the determination of the DA to deliver to all the people in the
       26 councils it controls, alone or in coalition with other parties, in
       stark contrast to the ANC's record of delivery only to a connected
       elite; and


  (4) records the fact that South Africa has now moved to a two-party
       system in which the DA represents the real and much better
       alternative to the current Government.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) is appalled by a media report that two members of a police vehicle
       theft unit in Mpumalanga were arrested while transporting parts of a
       stolen car in a government vehicle;


  (2) compliments the traffic officers that followed all the leads and
       pulled out all the stops that led to the arrest of these police
       criminals; and


  (3) appeals to all members of the public who witness criminal activity to
       report this so that the law can take its course.

[Applause.]

Mr S D MONTSITSI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes with satisfaction the state of the nation address delivered by
       our President, Thabo Mbeki, on 9 February 2001;


  (2) further notes that the speech received widespread acceptance from all
       progressive and right-minded South Africans;


  (3) calls on all patriots to heed the clarion call towards a unified
       offensive to eradicate poverty, fight corruption, and accelerate the
       pace of transformation and development; and


  (4) commends the President for his visionary leadership.

[Applause.]

Mnr F BEUKMAN: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -
  (1) met kommer kennis neem van die toename in voorvalle van moord, roof
       en ander geweld op die N2-roete vanaf Kaapstad na Somerset-Wes, wat
       die veiligheid van motoriste en passasiers in gedrang bring;


  (2) sy simpatie uitspreek teenoor die familie en naasbestaandes van mnr
       Bertie Louw van Firgrove wat in 'n aanval op die pad gedood is;


  (3) die Wes-Kaapse regering bedank vir die stappe wat gedoen is om die
       teenwoordigheid van die veiligheidsmagte op die roete te versterk;


  (4) 'n beroep op die sentrale Regering doen om meer hulpbronne beskikbaar
       te stel ten einde die veiligheid van padverbruikers op die roete te
       verseker;


  (5) 'n beroep op die Suid-Afrikaanse Nasionale Padowerheid (SANP) doen om
       die nodige stappe te doen om die foutiewe noodtelefone te herstel en
       nie-werkende beligting in orde te kry; en


  (6) 'n beroep op die SANP doen om 'n statusverslag oor die betrokke roete
       aan die Parlement as 'n saak van openbare belang voor te lê.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr F BEUKMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern the increase in the number of murders, robberies
       and other violent incidents on the N2 route from Cape Town to
       Somerset West, which is jeopardising the safety of motorists and
       passengers;


  (2) expresses its sympathy with the family and next-of-kin of Mr Bertie
       Louw of Firgrove, who was killed in an attack on the road;


  (3) thanks the Western Cape government for the steps which have been
       taken to strengthen the presence of security forces along the route;


  (4) appeals to central Government to make more resources available in
       order to ensure the safety of road users along the route;


  (5) appeals to the South African National Road Authority (SANRA) to take
       the necessary steps to repair the faulty emergency telephones and
       restore all malfunctioning lighting equipment; and


  (6) appeals to SANRA to present Parliament with a status report on the
       route in question as a matter of public interest.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay and disappointment the meddling of the executive in
       the work of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts midway into the
       investigations into the alleged malpractices in the R43 billion arms
       deal;
  (2) notes with shock the impasse between the executive and Scopa, which
       led to the replacement of highly qualified and competent members of
       the committee;


  (3) is concerned that the actions of the executive and their interference
       in the work of the committee may be prejudicial to the findings and
       recommendations of Scopa, and that the undue influence and
       interference in this matter raises a strong suspicion of a huge cover-
       up of possible malpractices and flawed procedures with regard to the
       appointment of contractors as reported by Scopa in the National
       Assembly's preliminary report; and


  (4) calls on the executive to refrain from meddling in and tampering with
       the work assigned to committees appointed by the House and further to
       refrain from undermining the integrity of this House.

[Applause.]

Mrs Z A KOTA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes the reports that the Office of the Deputy President's is
       requesting Government Ministers, provincial premiers and mayors to
       sign performance contracts with the Office to ensure that rural
       development projects are implemented;


  (2) further notes that the President's state of the nation address
       reflected on concrete programmes and areas where there will be pilot
       projects on rural development;


  (3) believes that this is further proof of the Government's commitment to
       providing a better life for all;


  (4) commends the Deputy President for this initiative; and


  (5) calls on our people to join the Government in realising the
       objectives of rural development.

[Applause.]
Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that the House of Lords in Britain has added its
       approval to that of the House of Commons for the use of embryo cells
       in research on cloning;


  (2) further notes that any cloning of humans is morally repugnant and an
       unjustifiable intrusion into human life, which is sacred, since no
       matter what the intention behind it, the consequences for society and
       individuals are ominous;


  (3) acknowledges that the ACDP has previously submitted a Private
       Member's Bill with regard to the prohibition of human cloning in
       South Africa in 1998, and that this Bill was rejected on the grounds
       that the issue was dealt with in the draft National Health Bill
       which, to date, has not been tabled in Parliament; and
  (4) calls on the Government urgently to reassess the need for a separate
       Bill prohibiting human cloning, as the timeframe for the tabling of
       the National Health Bill is not clear.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die AEB sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis hom uitspreek teen die onheilspellende tendense wat blyk uit
  die reaksie van die Minister van Veiligheid en Sekuriteit op die
  vreedsame optog en petisie deur veral lede van die Portugese gemeenskap
  van Suid-Afrika, naamlik dat -


  (1) persone of gemeenskappe se reg op petisie en vreedsame betoog
       ingevolge artikel 17 van die Grondwet selektief toegepas word;


  (2) hierdie reg, sowel as die reg van 'n gemeenskap op veiligheid
       (artikel 12), afhanklik gemaak word van die mate waarin so 'n
       gemeenskap die ou bestel van apartheid en/of kolonialisme beveg het
       al dan nie;


  (3) die Regering die geregverdigde aanspraak van Suid-Afrikaners op die
       regeringsplig ingevolge die Grondwet verwar met minagting van die
       Regering en die President;


  (4) mense wat hulle aansprake teenoor die Regering verwoord met die
       troefkaart van rassisme gedemoniseer word in stede daarvan dat hul
       aansprake ingevolge die Grondwet vervul word; en


  (5) die moontlike pleeg van misdaad deur lede van 'n gemeenskap
       klaarblyklik daardie gemeenskap se reg op beskerming teen misdaad
       relativeer.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the AEB:


  That the House expresses itself against the ominous trends which are
  apparent from the reaction of the Minister of Safety and Security to the
  peaceful protest march and petition particularly by members of the
  Portuguese community of South Africa -


  (1) the right of persons or communities to petition and peaceful protest
       in terms of section 17 of the Constitution is being selectively
       applied;


  (2) this right, as well as the right of a community to safety (section
       12), is made dependent on the extent to which such a community
       opposed the old system of apartheid and/or colonialism, or not;


  (3) the Government is confusing the justified demand of South Africans
       that the Government do its duty in terms of the Constitution with
       contempt for the Government and the President;


  (4) people who express their demands to the Government are demonised with
       the trump card of racism, instead of their demands in terms of the
       Constitution being met; and


  (5) the possible commission of crimes by members of a community
       apparently relativises that community's right to protection against
       crime.]

Mr M R BALOYI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the sterling contribution made by the Fedmis Company by
       constructing a school with eleven classrooms worth R270 000 for the
       community of Makhushane Phalaborwa in the Northern Province;


  (2) further notes that Fedmis is also involved with mathematics and
       science projects in the same area in partnership with the Phalaborwa
       Mining Company;


  (3) commends Fedmis and the Makhusane community for this initiative;


  (4) acknowledges that this demonstrates community and private sector
       partnership for the development of our communities; and


  (5) calls on other companies to follow the example of Fedmis and
       contribute toward a better life for all.
[Applause.]

Mr M L DA CAMARA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with disgust the contemptuous attack on the South African
       Portuguese community by Minister Steve Tshwete ...

[Interjections.]


  (2) further notes that the Minister's attack constitutes his only
       response to a peaceful and legal march by law-abiding citizens in
       their attempt to demonstrate their frustration with the epidemic
       levels of crime they face;


  (3) therefore calls on the Minister to -


       (a)  refrain from vilifying patriotic citizens with unsubstantiated
           accusations based on arbitrary grounds of a shared heritage and
           language;


       (b)  acknowledge the right of citizens to petition their government
           peacefully on any issue of their choosing, regardless of their
           heritage or whether they support the ANC or not; and


       (c)  apologise unconditionally to the organisers and the Portuguese
           community in general.

[Interjections.]

A comunidade Portugesa Sul Africana é Leal á A(')frica do Sul. [The South
African Portuguese community is loyal to South Africa.] [Applause.]

Mnr B M DOUGLAS: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die IVP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem van 'n toename in bende-oorloë op die Kaapse Vlakte,
       waarvan skoolonderrig en kinders op fisieke en sielkundige wyse die
       vernaamste ongevalle uitmaak;


  (2) sy medelye betuig met die familie en naasbestaandes van 'n SAPD-lid,
       inspekteur Johan van Rooyen, wat in een voorval tussen bendes in
       Hanover Park noodlottig gewond is; en


  (3) die Manenberg Peace Organisation gelukwens met hul sukses om vrede
       tussen strydende bendes te bewerkstellig.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.

[Mr B M DOUGLAS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) takes note of an increase in gang wars on the Cape Flats, with
       schooling and children physically and psychologically constituting
       the primary casualties;


  (2) expresses its sympathy with the family and next of kin of an SAPS
       member, Inspector Johan van Rooyen, who was fatally wounded in an
       incident between gangs in Hanover Park; and


  (3) congratulates the Manenberg Peace Organisation on their success in
       achieving peace between warring gangs.]

Mr N P NHLEKO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC and the Portfolio
Committee on Public Service and Administration:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the framework agreement that has been signed by the Government
           and labour during the job summit on 29 to 31 January 2001 at the
           University of the North, Pietersburg;


       (b)  the sense of responsibility and commitment that has been
           displayed by both parties with an intention to transform the
           Public Service; and


       (c)  that the agreement itself is a progressive step in creating a
           platform setting out objectives for transformation,
           restructuring and labour relations;


  (2) congratulates the Department of Public Service and Administration, in
       particular, and the public sector unions for their commitment to the
       acceleration of service delivery through transformatory strategies
       reflected in the framework agreement signed; and


  (3) calls on the parties to respect and honour the agreement for the
       benefit of the ordinary South Africans.

Dr R T RHODA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -
  (1) notes with shock that -


       (a)  another gang-related attack occurred in Eerste River yesterday,
           which left four more people dead and one person seriously
           injured;


       (b)  earlier this year, 14-year-old Karen Adriaanse was caught in the
           crossfire during a gang fight in Manenberg Road and died in
           hospital;


       (c)  more and more young and innocent children are becoming victims
           of these senseless killings; and


       (d)  last year, the SA Army had to move in to patrol vulnerable
           schools in Manenberg and some schools look like prisons in order
           to protect children from gang violence;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  all children have the right to be brought up in a safe
           environment; and


       (b)  gang activities have been terrorising communities for far too
           long and must be stopped now; and


  (3) urges the Minister to deliver on his promise that special attention
       will be paid to gang violence during 2001-2002 and take the necessary
       measures to rid communities of gang activities.

[Interjections.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: The motion preceding the
last motion was moved by a member of the ANC and was stated as being on
behalf of the ANC and a portfolio committee. Is that in order? I do not
think so.

A party motion cannot be on behalf of the committee. We know they rule the
committee, but it is not a good idea to state it so openly here!
[Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Order! The point of order is well taken. Motions are moved on
behalf of a party.

Chief N Z MTIRARA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with grave concern issues raised by the Leader of Government
       Business in a letter addressed to Madam Speaker on 31 January 2001
       which was tabled in this House on 6 February 2001;


  (2) is alarmed at the Deputy President's attempt to undermine the
       integrity and competence of the Standing Committee on Public
       Accounts;


  (3) notes, in conclusion, that Scopa is accountable to the National
       Assembly and not to the Leader of Government Business; and


  (4) calls on the Deputy President to refrain from attempts to govern by
       orders and intimidation rather than by legislation and the
       Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.

[Interjections.]

          EXTENSION OF TRIAL-RUN PERIOD OF QUESTIONS FOR ORAL REPLY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move the draft
resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That, with reference to the resolution adopted by the House on 13 October
  2000, the period for the trial run of questions for oral reply be further
  extended until 28 February 2001.

Agreed to.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

      (The late Mr P F Mbongo, Ms C C Mahlalela and Mr I B Ntshangase)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move:
  That the House -


  (1) notes the premature deaths of the honourable Petrus Fihli Mbongo, the
       hon Cengi Christine Mahlalela and the hon Isaiah Boy Ntshangase since
       the adjournment of the House in November 2000;


  (2) recognises the valuable contribution that the hon  members made to
       our democratic Parliament, also as dedicated members of the
       parliamentary committees;


  (3) believes that the hon members served the people of South Africa with
       selfless dedication;


  (4) mourns the passing of our fellow members; and


  (5) extends its heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones of the
       deceased and expresses the wish that they be filled with strength and
       fortitude in their time of sadness.

Hambani kahle, maQabane. [Go well, Comrades.]

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Madam Speaker, as this House adjourned for an extended
period of constituency work and local government elections at the end of
last year, none of us thought that during this recess we would lose three
members of this House.

On 7 December, the ANC learned with shock and sadness of the untimely
departure of the hon Cengi Christine Mahlalela from the Mpumalanga
province. Three weeks later, we also learned with shock of the untimely
departure of the hon Petrus Fihli Mbongo from the Gauteng province. A few
weeks later, the hon Isaiah Boy Ntshangase slipped into a coma and passed
away on 4 February.

The ANC deployed these comrades to this House because of their qualities,
virtues and experience in the traditions of the organisation they espoused.
They were deployed to this House to advance a transformation agenda that
the ANC and its allies are implementing.

They knew their responsibilities and made their contribution as individuals
and as part of the ANC collective, to build a society that is free from
racism and racial prejudice, to address the massive inequality of our
society, to bridge the divides in our society and build a united nation, a
nation that is composed of individuals who understand that they are united
by the fact that we are all human beings, sharing a past and working
towards a common destiny and future.

Comrades Ntshangase, Mbongo and Mahlalela knew what the ANC expected of
them and they did not fail the movement to the very end. It is sad that we
only remember the significant contribution of our comrades to society when
they are no more. Would it not have been better if these comrades were with
us today, so that they could hear what their comrades, colleagues and
elected representatives from all political persuasions in Parliament think
of their contributions of creating a better life for all?

They will always be in our minds for their contribution in the struggle for
national liberation in our country. They carried out this task with zeal
and commitment. Their efforts bore fruit with a number of transformative
policies debated and adopted by this House.

It is appropriate for us to commemorate these three gallant fighters of our
nation by coming to terms with the lessons that we need to learn from them
and their achievements. They gave selflessly during the struggle and
continued to do so in this new era. This commitment must inspire us to ask
the question: What can I do to contribute towards the social change in our
country?

It is in response to this call that these comrades took an unwavering
stance and consistently pursued the agenda of a better life in their
communities and in Parliament. We also learned from these comrades the need
for ANC comrades to adapt to new realities and sharpen our strategic
intervention. The ANC dips its revolutionary banner in honour to these
fallen heroes. We vow to continue with the ideals that these comrades lived
for.

We further extend our heartfelt condolences to their families, friends and
loved ones. They are not alone in their hour of darkness, sorrow and
grieving. Their pain is ours, their loss is ours. [Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I wish to associate the DP with the motion
moved by the hon Chief Whip.

There was a time when the death of a member of Parliament was a rare
occurrence but, unhappily, this is no longer so. Increasingly, this House
has been called upon to pass motions of condolence, and the present one is
particularly sad. Having to mark the passing of no less than three
colleagues who have died since we last met, is a bitter experience. They
have all gone long before their normally expected and allotted time. We
salute the memory of these three MPs and we extend our sympathies to their
families, their party, and all those who loved them.

Mr E J LUCAS: Madam Speaker, the IFP wishes to associate itself with the
motion of condolence in respect of the late Mr P F Mbongo, Ms C C Mahlalela
and Mr I B Ntshangase. We believe that these hon members served the people
of South Africa with dedication.

Furthermore, the IFP wishes to express its sincerest condolences to the
spouses, families, relatives and friends of the deceased. May they be
filled with strength and fortitude in their time of sadness. May God grant
them peace.

Mnr C H F GREYLING: Mevrou die Speaker, ons vereenselwig ons graag met die
voorstel van roubeklag soos dit deur die Hoofsweep van die
Meerderheidsparty op die Ordelys geplaas is as 'n voorstel sonder
kennisgewing.

Namens die Nuwe NP wil ek graag ons opregte meegevoel betuig met die
naasbestaandes, vriende en kennisse van die oorledenes. Alhoewel ek die
oorledenes nie persoonlik geken het nie, weet ons almal dat dit 'n baie
traumatiese ervaring vir die naasbestaandes bly wanneer so 'n gevoelige
verlies ervaar word, en ons spreek ons diepe spyt uit oor die dood van die
drie lede wat kollegas in hierdie Huis was.

Ons wens die familie, vriende en ANC-partygenote van die ontslape kollegas
sterkte toe en vertrou dat hulle vertroos sal word vir die groot en
onmeetbare verlies wat hulle gely het deur die afsterwe van die drie lede.
Ons eer hulle nagedagtenis. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C H F GREYLING: Madam Speaker, we would like to associate ourselves
with the motion of condolence as placed on the Order Paper by the Chief
Whip of the Majority Party as a motion without notice.
On behalf of the New NP I would like to express our sincere sympathy with
the next-of-kin, friends and acquaintances of the deceased. Although I did
not know the deceased personally, all of us know that such a great loss is
always a very traumatic experience for the next-of-kin, and we express our
deepest regret at the demise of the three members who were our colleagues
in this House.

We wish the family, friends and ANC party associates of the late colleagues
strength and trust that they will be comforted in the great and
immeasurable loss they have suffered through the demise of the three
members. We honour their memory.]

Dr S E MZIMELA: Madam Speaker, I rise to express the UDM's support for the
motion which has just been put and to express our own deepest sympathy to
the bereaved families of Messrs Mbongo and Ntshangase, as well as Ms
Mahlalela.

Our sorrow is accompanied by faith and prayer that the deceased may find
eternal rest. To each of our departed colleagues we say: requiescant in
pace [Rest in peace.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, the ACDP was sad to hear of the deaths of
the following members: Mbongo, Mahlalela and Ntshangase. We pray that God
will comfort their families at this time.

Dr C P MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, dit is vir ons in die VF altyd jammer en
hartseer as daar 'n medekollega en lid van hierdie Raad te sterwe kom. Dit
is dinge wat ons almal hartseer maak en wat 'n party sleg tref.

Ons wil van die VF se kant af vandag ons steun uitspreek vir die voorstel
soos ingedien deur die agb Hoofsweep van die Meerderheidsparty. Ons dink
vandag nie net aan hierdie kollegas wat ontslaap het nie, maar ook veral
aan hulle families wat agterbly en wat hartseer is. Ons vertrou egter dat
hulle vertroosting en aanvaarding sal vind. (Translation of Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, to us in the FF it is always regrettable and
sad when a fellow colleague and member of this House passes away. This is
something that causes us all grief and hits a party hard.

On behalf of the FF we want to convey our support today for the motion as
introduced by the hon Chief Whip of the Majority Party. We are thinking
today not only of these colleagues who passed away, but specifically of
their families that remain and are sad. We trust, however, that they will
find comfort and acceptance.]

Mr G E BALOI: Madam Speaker, the UCDP expresses its condolences to the
families of the late Mahlalela, Mbongo and the very young and talented Mr I
B Ntshangase, who passed away during the parliamentary recess. About Ms
Mahlalela and Mr Mbongo, I cannot say much because I did not know them very
well. As for Ntshangase, much can be said. He was still in his early years
and very active. He was jocular and always smiling. His political career
was promising. It ended in a very short space of time.

South Africa, with its new democracy, is being crippled by the death of
young people. Although God is never wrong, He plans His things accordingly.
These youngsters are the ripe corn that should be reaped and stored.

We as the UCDP wish to say to the families of the deceased that they must
have faith in the living God. Ma Bathembele kuYehova qha; uyaphilisa. [They
should have faith in the living God; He can heal.]

These beloved children died while in the service of their mother country,
South Africa. Let their souls rest in peace forever.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, this is not the first time since I came to
this Parliament 18 months ago, that we have been informed of the deaths of
three hon members in one day. The PAC is saddened by the unexpected bad
news of the passing away of the hon Petrus Fihli Mbongo, the hon Cengi
Christine Mahlalela and the hon Isaiah Boy Ntshangase. The PAC conveys its
deepest condolences to their families, to all their relatives and to the
ANC. This is a national loss for all of us. It is devastating but we must
derive inspiration from their lives and their dedication to national
service.

Ha ba tsamaye hantle. Ba bolelle Shaka, Hintsa, Moshoeshoe, Sekhukhune le
Makhado, mmoho le bahale bohle ba rona, hore naha ya rona le moruo wa yona
ha di so be matsohong a bana ba thari. Boitseko bo tswela pele.
(Translation of Sesotho paragraph follows.)
[Let them go well. They must tell Shaka, Hintsa, Moshoeshoe, Sekhukhune and
Makhado, and all our heroes, that our country and its economy are not yet
in the hands of the Africans. The struggle continues.]

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, the FA would also like to extend its
condolences to the family and friends of our late colleagues. Although we
belonged to different political parties, we interacted in a positive manner
as colleagues in the various portfolio committees and in this House, in
order to seek and build a better South Africa. We honour their memory.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, hon members, it is sad that we have to
stand here and express our condolence on the loss of three important
members of our Parliament, namely I B Ntshangase, C C Mahlalela and P F
Mbongo. Their faith in South Africa never diminished and they patriotically
championed the cause of democracy.

Our late comrades used their skills and leadership qualities to develop the
sociopolitical status of South Africans. The MF conveys its heartfelt
condolences to the bereaved families, friends and the ANC. May God give
them courage and fortitude to bear the loss of our great comrades.

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, the AEB associates itself with the motion by
the Chief Whip. It is an extraordinary loss to lose three members of the
House in such a short period. I express the condolences of myself and my
party to the families, the next-of-kin and the friends of the deceased. May
the good Lord bless them in this period of great loss. May I also ask our
colleagues to think in their prayers today of the hon Mr Paul Ditshetelo of
the UCDP and his wife. Their eldest son died in a motor car accident on
Friday. The funeral will be on Thursday. Let us also think of our colleague
at this time.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Mohlomphegi Speaker, re re homotšegang go

[The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, we would like to extend
our condolences to the bereaved families of Mbongo, Ntshangase and
Mahlalela, as well as the ANC, on the loss of their loved ones.
Furthermore, we note that although death is a devastating phenomenon, we
should derive inspiration from the fact that it can only occur where there
was life, and that no one can die without fist having lived. Therefore,
what remains for us to do is to continue their heroic and self-sacrificing
contributions to the national service which they have rendered so
unselfishly.]

Agreed to unanimously, all the members standing.

                             PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, hon President, hon
Deputy President, fellow members of the National Assembly, on Friday we
were given an inspiring address by the President of our nation, an address
that has received acclaim from all quarters, an address that has given us a
firm understanding of the priorities and strategies of Government for the
coming year.

This positive framework has inspired the nation, providing us with a focus
to carry us forward in our task of transformation. We, the ANC, the
majority party in this House, want to focus in this debate on issues and
ways of taking the country forward. We do not want to be engaged in
unproductive mudslinging. Rather, we, as the elected representatives of the
people, must seek solutions for the myriad of problems that challenge our
nation.

We must measure our successes by outcomes, rather than acclaim. Our
President, in his address, dealt with a wide range of issues, but certain
issues stand out. The first is the unity of our people. Our President has
called for unity in action for change. He has reminded us that, as a
people, we share a common legacy, a legacy of division which we must work
together to eradicate. As a nation we must stand together, fighting for
change in the daily lives of ordinary people in the fight against disease,
illiteracy and prejudice, seeking to build a national consensus as we move
towards prosperity.

Of major significance in the address was the shift in focus from macro to
microeconomic issues to hasten economic growth now that we have achieved a
framework of fiscal stability. We all know that poverty is the current
challenge facing our country, that without a concerted and united war
against poverty, we will not achieve the transformation of the lives of the
people, of the lives of those who were so disadvantaged by our history.

The people have been patient, they have waited for a long time, through
hardship and famine. They cannot wait much longer. We must move with speed
and efficiency and resist the temptation to make political capital out of
poverty. We, therefore, particularly welcome the plans for rural
development and urban renewal in townships across the country. But, as the
President has pointed out, the success of these plans will depend on the
extent to which the people can be mobilised to participate actively in the
development of their own communities.

Indeed, it is in this regard that we, as members of Parliament, must play a
leading role. It is in our constituencies that we must be the link between
Government and the people. It is we who must build the commitment of the
people to participate in the programmes of Government, building their
futures, with Government as the facilitator rather than the benefactor.

On 8 January the ANC celebrated its 89th birthday. In its statement on this
day, the national executive committee of the ANC reminded us that:


  Over the centuries, slavery, colonialism and neocolonialism, have ravaged
  the African continent ...


  The situation has to be corrected by rebuilding Africa's economies to
  ensure that they are able to generate the necessary volumes of wealth,
  work for the people and the capacities that will ensure that we take our
  rightful place within the global economy.

It went on to say:


  The new world order that it being born must be defined, in part, by the
  fact that Africa and her people play an equal role with other people in
  shaping that new and more equitable global political, economic and social
  order.

It further outlined the ANC's commitment to urban renewal and rural
development, and the close co-operation of all spheres of government in the
implementation of all these programmes. It calls on community-based
organisations to be involved in this important and exciting work, and calls
on us to intensify our efforts to ensure that our population, as a whole,
is educated and armed with the right skills.

Next year the ANC will celebrate its 90th birthday - an important milestone
in the evolvement of the ANC throughout the different historical periods
into a genuine people's movement and an agent for change. Since its
inception, the core philosophy of our movement has been to unite and fight
against racism. From 1912 to date our core philosophy has been, in the
words of the Freedom Charter:


  South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and no
  government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of
  all the people.
In 1911, Pixley ka Isaka Seme, first treasurer-general of the ANC, said:


  The demon of racialism must be buried and forgotten. It has shed among us
  sufficient blood. We are one people. These divisions, these jealousies,
  are the cause of all our woes and of all our backwardness and ignorance
  today.

At our NEC legotla, as we entered our 89th birthday, we reaffirmed this
commitment in our very first resolution. Included in this resolution is the
commitment to -


  ... a mass campaign to raise public consciousness on racism, tribalism
  and xenophobia, and to unite the people of South Africa to end all racial
  disparities in our society.

In 10 years' time the ANC will be 100 years old. No other movement has such
a consistent commitment to equality and a nonracial democratic society.
[Applause.] We cannot predict the future, but I know one thing as sure as I
stand here, namely that the ANC will remain committed to nonracism, and
nonsexism, in its abhorrence of exploitation and discrimination.
The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: As will the opposition.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Today, having fought for democracy,
we are faced with the mammoth task of fighting poverty, illiteracy and
disease. This task does not rest with Government alone, nor does it rest
with the majority party alone. It is the responsibility of all South
Africans. None of us should become spectators, waiting for Government to
dish out benefits, programmes and solutions. None of us should become
spectators, waiting for Government to make mistakes. We all need to become
participants in the battle against poverty. Those in need must be empowered
to become active participants in building a better life for themselves.

Racism infects all our lives, coming as we do from a racially divided past.
Our prejudices are complex and deeply ingrained, often far beneath the
conscious mind. When we attempt to unpack this issue, it is often
interpreted as a fight against whites or as harping on the past. We, the
ANC, are not interested in a fight against whites, or any other sector of
our population. We are committed to the fight against exploitation and
prejudice; exploitation based on racial differences, class differences,
gender, religion and creed ... [Applause.] ... exploitation of the aged,
the disabled, the weak and the poor. It is on this that we base our
commitment to fight against poverty.

We have seen President Thabo Mbeki emerge as an international ambassador in
the fight against poverty. He receives recognition form the world's most
distinguished leaders. He is invited to all the most crucial international
forums. Just the other day he was telephoned by the President of the United
States, George Bush Jnr, who assured him of his and his new government's
commitment to our continent.

We must all recognise that we cannot fight for our prosperity in isolation
from our neighbours, and that, without the rebirth of our region and our
continent, we cannot hope for a prosperous future. We are blessed, in this
quest, to have a leader with the vision and commitment of our President.

It is sad that so many of our compatriots find it necessary to bad-mouth
our country abroad. Of course, people have the right to criticise. We, the
ANC, fought for this right, for which many of our comrades lost their
lives. I urge all those who are falling into the habit of negativity to
pause and ask themselves: Whose interests am I serving by my pessimistic
view of our new South Africa? What are the long-term effects of my
negativity? Do I benefit my country in any way?

Whatever our political beliefs, we must ensure that nothing we say or do
harms the prospects of our country. We must ensure that we are responsible
and constructive in our criticism, and that we engage in debate rather than
in slander.

We are privileged to serve our nation in this democratic Parliament. As the
majority party, we enjoy a mandate from the people. As ordinary members of
Parliament, we have the responsibility to ensure that the programmes of
Government are implemented. It is our task, as the majority party, to
ensure that Government fulfils the mandate of the people who elected the
ANC to govern in accordance with its policies and manifesto. It is our job,
as the party that has been chosen by the people to lead the nation, to be
at the forefront of guarding against inefficiency, maladministration and
corruption.
Increasingly, the focus of this House will be on oversight, especially now
that we have put in place the legislative framework of our democratic
constitutional state. As members, we must interact with our communities,
monitoring the implementation of legislation and policy. The work of our
parliamentary committees must also focus on going out into our communities,
of strengthening the links between Parliament and the people so that we can
build a truly participatory democracy.

Of course, it does happen that tensions do arise between the executive and
the legislative arm. Some people may disagree with me on this matter. This
is the nature of a parliamentary democracy. However, such tension must not
be allowed to obscure our wider objective of transforming the lives of the
people, nor undermine the relationship between and the integrity of the
different arms of government. These healthy tensions should also not be
blown out of proportion.

Our commitment has always been to the people, the poor and the
dispossessed. History has shown us that if one is close to the people, no
force on earth, no matter how powerful, can dislodge one. Our President
continues to have the fullest support of the ANC and the people of this
country as he leads a nation facing the challenge to transform itself into
one nation, united in its diversity, united in prosperity and united in its
commitment to making this the African century. [Applause.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, Mr President, colleagues, I
would firstly like to begin today by acknowledging Mrs Helen Suzman in the
gallery, who is an object example of excellence in public service and
courage in pursuit of principle. [Applause.]

I wish to begin today with a proposition that I believe is beyond argument
or appeal, that South Africa today is a better place than it was 10 years
ago. There is a simple but profound reason for this. The mace of personal
dignity, which is the moral core of liberal democracy, has created, in the
breasts of our people, hearts filled with hope for the future. The hope of
a better life was the essence of the contract struck between this
Government and the people of South Africa in 1994.

On Friday last week, the people of South Africa waited, some with their
hopes still intact, others with a battered, fading hope, and some perhaps
with their hope shrouded in a looming despair, for the state of the nation
address. The tone of the President's speech was, in my opinion, a relief
after last year. The President, to his enormous credit, preached the
harmony of unity, not the discord of division. I applaud him for that and
promise faithfully that the DA will stand as one with the Government in a
joint endeavour to forge one nation in South Africa.

The President also listed a number of achievements that deserve praise, and
there are plenty of praise singers who will no doubt draw attention to them
in this debate. He also announced a set of new initiatives designed to
liberate our economy, and we support these with enthusiasm. All these
positives we acclaim. However, in treating some of the greatest ills
afflicting our land with silence or slighting them into insignificance, the
President failed to face up to the terrible fears that haunt our nation.

Unemployment, crime, Aids and corruption are the great issues on which this
Government is judged. They ride across our land like the dread four
horsemen of the Apocalypse. And there is ultimately only one judgement that
counts, and it is not the judgment of the Leader of the Opposition or any
other member of what is, frankly, a small elite caste of politicians,
business people and journalists. The judgment that counts is the judgement
of the people of South Africa. It was with the people that the ANC struck
their agreement in 1994. It was the people who traded hopes for a better
life for votes in 1994. Again, in 1999, as we have just heard, they voted
for the renewed promise of delivery.

I must be very straight about this: the ANC Government is perilously close
to being found in breach of contract by the people of South Africa.
[Interjections.] The ANC may deny it, but the results of the local
government elections were an unmistakable warning to this Government,
because at the end of the day, the ANC will have to deliver, or it will be
replaced. [Interjections.] That is the truth, because the judgement of the
people will not be merciful or understanding, but it will be just.
[Interjections.]

To put it bluntly, on a matter that is related and which we have had a
great deal of noise about, I do not want to waste any energy or time on an
auction of patriotism. I believe I lead a party wholehearted in its
commitment to South Africa, its constitutional order and all its people.
The patriotism we embrace is a patrimony of the whole which includes the
whole nation, not any one section of it at the expense of any other.

However, I believe, as well, that a patriotic leader's primary duty is to
tell the truth to the people. The first essential step in delivering a
better life is to acknowledge, not the state of the nation in abstract
terms, but the state of the people in concrete terms. I am talking about
our homeless, our jobless, our communities terrorised by crime, our
families devastated by Aids, our struggling businessmen and women and, yes,
young professional people, some of whom are poised reluctantly to leave
their homeland. They despair and they leave, not because of what I say, but
because of what the Government does and does not do.

I mention these people, not to trumpet the negative, but to say to members
very frankly that, on several fronts, we are facing a crisis. Yet, the
President's speech seemed designed to veil the fact that, in significant
respects, we are in a crisis. It was a speech that read - in large measure,
and I agree with much of it - like a speech of a managing director. But in
times of crisis nations need leadership, not simply management.

This then raises the question: What is leadership? We are now in the new
age after the collapse of both apartheid and communism. We live in a new
world. Allow me to quote from a biography of a leader, president Harry
Truman, who lived and worked in another new age, the period just after the
devastation of World War II. It was said of him:


  He was not a hero, or a magician, or a chess player, or an obsession. He
  was a certifiable member of the human race, direct, fallible, and
  unexpectedly wise when it counted.


  He did not require to be loved. He did not expect to be followed blindly.
  Congressional opposition never struck him as subversive, nor did he
  regard his critics as traitors.


  He walked around Washington every morning - it was safe then. He met
  reporters frequently as a matter of course, and did not blame them for
  his failures. He did not use his office as a club or a shield, or a
  hiding place. He worked at it ... he said he lived by the Bible and by
  history. So armed, he proved that the ordinary American is capable of
  grandeur and that a president can be a human being ...

My point is that South Africa today is crying out for leadership that sees
with a clear eye, that speaks with an honest voice and that acts with swift
resolution for the good of all the people; leadership that faces difficulty
without flinching and does the right thing even if that goes against narrow
partisan interests; leadership that shoulders responsibility, that never
seeks scapegoats to blame or invents enemies to hate, that gives clear
direction and that trusts people and wins their faith in return.

Where the President of South Africa provides such leadership he will have
the support of the whole nation, and of my party as well. But let me add
that it is not the President alone that must provide such leadership. All
of us in this House have a duty to live up to the same standard.

Let me speak about these great unmentionables - HIV/Aids. It is wrong to
pretend, as the President seemed to do in his address on Friday, that Aids
is just another disease of poverty. It is not. It is a national catastrophe
of unimagined proportion. The people who are dying are not only the poor,
although the poor bear the brunt of the onslaught, because young people
with good living conditions are also dying in our country today before they
turn forty. Babies receiving the best of care are also dying in their
infancy.

For every Nkosi Johnson - who we understand was hospitalised today, and
whose bravery has caught the imagination of the whole of our nation - there
are thousands upon thousands of South Africans dying in pain, misery,
loneliness and obscurity. We have to heed the parable of the Good
Samaritan. We cannot walk by on the other side of the road.

We can devise the best prevention policy in the world and we can treat as
many people as possible, but unless the fight against HIV/Aids is fuelled
by inspired and committed leadership, it will fail. We need leadership
here. Frankly, that leadership has to come from the President. We also need
focus. To this end, the Democratic Alliance proposes that the Government
establish a Deputy Ministry within the Ministry of Health dedicated
entirely to the fight against Aids.

While the Government must shoulder the blame for the terrible mishandling
of HIV/Aids, my party also wishes to acknowledge some responsibility in
this regard. The terrible human cost of Aids outweighs, in my view, a
legitimate attachment to narrow definitions of intellectual property
rights. Therefore, the Democratic Alliance's historic opposition to
legislation that would allow parallel imports and compulsory licensing of
HIV/Aids drugs will cease from today, conditional on Government declaring
Aids to be a national emergency in terms of the Trips Accord and without
compromising medicines control.

The people of South Africa also want leadership in the struggle against
crime. Here I regret to say that I am compelled to state that the Minister
of Safety and Security is failing to provide that leadership. On the
contrary, instead of taking the fight to the criminals, he has declared
war, in the most vile and racist terms, on the law-abiding Portuguese
community of South Africa. His contempt for his own citizens is palpable,
his arrogance is despicable and his damage to our country is incalculable.

The hon Mr Tshwete's letter, which I have read carefully, is staggering in
its contempt for those South Africans whose only crime is to look to the
President and his Cabinet for leadership in the struggle against crime. If
they cannot look there, where are they meant to look? And yet the Minister
accuses the organisation of holding the Government in contempt, defining
itself as an opponent of the Government, racist and colonialist. It defies
belief.

The Government's contempt for the people, so naked and glaring in that
letter, is reflected also in its refusal to publicise the official crime
statistics. I listened carefully to what the President said on Friday. He
said he expects to able to lift the moratorium in June. It is not good
enough. We know just how often expectations on crime have been dashed by
Government. The Constitution grants each of us - crime victim and
parliamentarian alike - a fundamental right to know. It is not in
Government's gift to withhold or bestow this right at its whim or pleasure.
We will take action to enforce this right.

The people are desperate for leadership in the fight for jobs. On Friday
10, the President quoted Statistics SA selectively, with respect, saying
that total employment increased from 1996 to 1999. But what the hon the
President did not say is that this increased was caused entirely by the
informal sector which is usually a source of tiny and fitful income. We
should ask the people of South Africa whether they prefer to sell tomatoes
and wire toys at the roadside or to work for a salary in a formal job,
because the same survey from Statistics SA reports that employment in the
formal sector had actually dropped from 5,2 million to 4,8 million in the
very period that the President referred to.

One of the problems that we have - and this has been said a hundred times -
is with the labour laws. I do not need to make the case, once again, that
the cost of labour and all its costs inhibits economic and job growth. The
President himself seems to be of the same view. But why then did he merely
commit himself to ``consulting'' about reforming the labour laws. This was
an even weaker stand than the one taken last year from this podium by the
President when he promised amendments, which are like the Loch Ness
monster: much spoken about, but never sighted.
The people need leadership on this front and I am afraid it was not
provided on Friday. We also need to move ahead swiftly with privatisation
to ensure investors and industrialists a stable and predictable economic
future. I applaud the President for committing himself to ``a managed
liberalisation of state assets''. I sincerely hope that he puts more
emphasis on the noun and less on the adjective. But here again, bold
leadership is required. The people cry out for food on the table, decent
hospitals, reasonable shelters and proper schools. Yet, as Thomas Aquinas
once reminded us:


  Even God himself cannot make two and two equal other than four.

So, let us be frank and honest with the people. The President must tell
them that he cannot hold down the budget deficit. He cannot reduce debt and
massively uplift the poor through an increase in growth rates, unless and
until he goes for a massive downsizing of the Public Service and wholesale
privatisation. The people must be told that he will liberate R15 billion -
and not the projected R6 billion - of state assets annually. He must tell
them that the jobs summit of two years ago was an exercise in self-
deception which has produced precious little in the way of results.

He should take the people in his confidence. They must be told that he will
lead by example, with an employer-initiated retrenchment tool in the Public
Service, starting with the so-called supernumeraries whom we are now told
cannot be removed from their posts. He must tell the people that he will
use the proceeds of both these great exercises to get the interest rate
down, help extend credit and boost job creation. [Interjections.] If I were
that hon Minister, who so failed on the poverty front, I would keep quiet!
[Laughter.] These two steps, boldly taken, would go a long way towards
liberating our economy and with it the people of South Africa. We do not
need, as the President promised, just steps down the information
superhighway. We need a flying leap just to keep pace, not even to get
ahead.

The steps announced by the hon the President on Friday are welcome and long
overdue. But let us also tell the truth about the new technology. One
cannot try to harness it through control, centralisation and
overregulation. We need a highway of incentives and not a roadblock of
Telkom exclusivity or interference in the third cellular licence, the
confiscation of mineral wealth or the threatening of investors with
prescribed assets.

The people are crying out for principled leadership of political parties.
Yes, as the hon the Chief Whip of the Majority Party said, racism exists
and it exists in all parties. But it is instructive to contrast the way in
which the DA and the ANC deal with racism when it emerges in their own
ranks. One must just ask ex-councillor Yvonne Wood how quickly the DP moved
to expel her from her party - my party - when evidence surfaced of her
making racist remarks. [Interjections.] It took 24 hours.

I can tell hon members that if Dumisane Makhaye, one of the ANC's Ministers
in KwaZulu-Natal, had been a member of the DA and had acted in the racist
way he did in the KwaZulu-Natal legislature last week, he would have been
kicked out of his job and out of my party in 24 hours. [Interjections.] As
it is, he has received no censure from his party at all. [Applause.]

Finally, as the President reminded us, Africa needs leadership.
[Interjections.] The President said on Friday - and obviously those members
there disagree with him - that ``no African child should ever walk in fear
of guns, tyrants and abuse''. To that we can only say ``amen''. But this is
just what African children and adults, including judges, MPs and newspaper
editors, fear today and every day in Zimbabwe under the terror and
lawlessness of Robert Mugabe, whom President Mbeki has failed so
conspicuously to confront, let alone to condemn. [Interjections.] And, to a
lesser extent, we see the denial of basic freedoms in Swaziland and we see
its delay in Lesotho. We see a new imperialism ...

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: [Inaudible.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Israel was not in Africa when I last checked,
but your knowledge of geography is so brilliant I will defer to it.
[Interjections.]

We see a new imperialism and even a new colonialism, albeit of an African
type, in the current carve-up of the Congo, where Angola is swallowing up
the southwest, Zimbabwe and Namibia entrenching their southeastern
interests, Uganda in the northeast and Rwanda in the east. [Interjections.]

For Africa to rise there must be one universal standard of justice, liberty
and democracy for all and for everyone. When any African country fails to
live up to that standard, it must be denounced unequivocally, isolated and
despatched as a pariah, unworthy of the appellation ``African''.

Great leadership looks on times of enormous adversity as a special
challenge. Now is the time for this Government to honour the contract
entered into with the people of South Africa more than six years ago. Now
is the time to go back to the people, to trust them, to speak to them, to
listen to them, to give them the means and the opportunity to realise their
own talents. [Interjections.] The people, free from restraint, will make
South Africa great. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Speaker, Comrade President,
Comrade Deputy President, hon members, Comrade President's state of the
nation address was spot-on in its delineation of the challenges that face
us as Government, a nation and, indeed, a continent. Equally proper and
fitting were the strategies and policy position he outlined as core issues
that we should embrace for the realisation of the said goals.
The prevention, investigation and prosecution of crime are matters that
immediately come to the centre of that overall struggle to change and
transform our country into a better place for all our people. The pursuit
of that ideal cannot and should never be seen as the exclusive preserve of
the Government and the law-enforcement agencies. Indeed, the biggest
majority of our people, coming from all sectors of our population -
business, organised labour and other organs of civil society - have taken
the position that much as they fought at the forefront of the struggle
against the menace of apartheid tyranny, they are not, this time around,
going to define their role in the fight against crime and the creation of a
safer and more secure environment for all merely as one of political
posturing and finger-pointing, such as we have just seen from the hon
member here. [Interjections.]

On the contrary, they see themselves as active participants in the overall
effort to rid the country of the scourge of crime. As they do so, they are,
in ever-increasing numbers and across the racial divide, watching those
demagogues and charlatans who have, in pursuit of petty party-political
goals, decided to occupy a cosy seat somewhere in the pavilion, vainly
praying that the Government will fail.
Guided by the criminal justice departments, this broad array of forces
against crime is putting in resources of all sorts, such as CCTVs,
vehicles, funds, expertise, etc, for the consolidation of the community
policing fora across the face of the country to ensure the success of a
massive mobilisation campaign of all our people against crime. Furthermore,
all the law enforcement agencies are in full swing, giving criminals no
quarter.

As a result, the successes are immense and clearly visible to all those who
have eyes to see. Between March last year and February this year, total
arrests stand at 462 502, with 154 929 of those being for serious crimes.
[Interjections.] Over 18 000 illegal firearms were confiscated, and over
14 000 stolen vehicles were recovered.

Through undercover and conventional operations we eliminated over 200
syndicates, and arrested, prosecuted and convicted over 2 300 of their
members. We busted illicit laboratories, we seized counterfeit goods and
medicines, and prosecuted thieves and criminals involved in commercial
crimes, stocktheft, and theft of diamonds and gold, and effected seizures
and arrests related to endangered species.

With regard to family violence, child protection and sex-related crimes, we
secured 1 551 convictions in which children were victims, and 369 involving
adult victims. [Interjections.] The total period of imprisonment in respect
of the specific offences amounted to 22 551 years.

Over and above all these successes, the Police and the Scorpions recovered
billions of rands and seized properties worth billions of rands belonging
to thieves and criminals of all kinds. Given this record of resounding
success in just one year, only a fool, a liar and a braggart can stand up
and declare: ``This Government lacks the political will to deal with crime
and criminals.'' [Applause.]

In the course of this year we shall redouble our efforts to score even
better results. [Interjections.] The automation of criminal and civil
justice processes in the Johannesburg and Durban courts, their branch
courts, selected police stations, prisons and facilities belonging to the
Department of Social Development have been set for completion by March
2003. During the same period a national photo image system will be
implemented to increase the investigating capacity of the SAPS by creating
a digital photo album for identification and exhibit management purposes.

An inmate-tracking system which will alleviate blockages associated with
identification, verification and monitoring of prisoners in various
correctional services, social development and SAPS facilities should be
completed by March 2004. Already a contract has been agreed upon for the
introduction of an Automated Fingerprint Identification System which will
enhance the speedy and cost-effective identification of fingerprints.

Other projects include the implementation of an electronic data interchange
system whereby Correctional Services will notify the SA Police on the
release of sentenced prisoners; the extension of access to the SAPS Crime
Administration System and the Criminal Record Identification System to the
Departments of Justice, Correctional Services and Social Development, the
establishment of communication technology infrastructure, and the
establishment of a detention control system.

We shall continue with operations such as roadblocks and cordon-and-search
operations as part of Operation Crackdown, establish special training teams
to arrest persons for whom warrants of arrest have been issued for serious
and violent crimes, implement a zero-tolerance approach towards less
serious crimes, and improve our intelligence capacity around the profiling
of criminal syndicates.

The SA Police will increase its capacity at station level to sustain the
successes achieved through Operation Crackdown. Fifty fully equipped crime
prevention units will be established this year in order to implement sector
policing. A new specialised crime prevention training course will also be
introduced. Air-supported reaction forces will be established in Gauteng,
KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape in order to decrease
the response time for crimes such as vehicle hijacking, armed robbery and
other serious crimes.

The first of these reaction forces was established in Gauteng during
January this year as part of Operation Tshwane. The reaction force
contributed to the arrest of more than 20 hijackers during the first two
weeks of the operation. SAPS aircraft will also be fitted with tracker
systems for the purpose of tracking hijacked vehicles.

We will ensure the expansion of the organised crime approach during this
year by establishing additional organised crime task teams. For this
purpose, more than 500 SAPS specialised investigation units are being
transformed into two new types of units, ie organised crime units and
serious and violent crime units. Existing specialised units such as Sanab,
vehicle crime, commercial branch and stock theft units are now becoming
part of the organised crime units.

Correctional Services will expand its accommodation capacity through the
completion of new prisons in Qalakabusha, Empangeni, Kokstad, Devon,
Bloemfontein and Louis Trichardt, and new parole boards will soon be
replacing the present system. A White Paper on Correctional Services is
being developed and is aimed at formulating long-term policies in order to
address the major issues facing the department.

Furthermore, and as part of our overall drive to bring communities on
board, a single structure between communities and the relevant cluster
departments will be established to ensure an integrated approach to
community involvement in the integrated justice system. The cluster will
launch a major community mobilisation programme in the 124 priority police
station areas in co-operation with community structures. In relation to the
stabilisation of public order-related flashpoints, the cluster will
establish a rapid development stability force this year that will be used
in the event of serious incidents.

Violent crimes on farms will also receive special attention. I have already
agreed to appoint a committee comprising academics, persons from the legal
profession and other experts to investigate the causes of these crimes.
Major operations will be launched this year in the areas where most of
these crimes are occurring. One of the purposes of these operations will be
to recruit farmers and farmworkers into structures such as reservists and
other appropriate structures in order to establish a farm cell on each and
every farm. The SA Police Service will purchase four additional helicopters
to the value of R40 million in the course of this year to improve our
reaction time in rural areas.

Finally, the cluster will tackle the problem of corruption head-on. It is,
we must admit, a serious scourge, which has for some time now frustrated
the efforts of our Police Service, the courts and prisons to deal with
criminals as swiftly as possible.

On the issue of our statistics, I am making this point for the umpteenth
time: we are not going to release faulty statistics, precisely because we
want the public to consume what is reliable, so that the advice they
provide to the police and other departments in the security cluster is
advice that is based on reliable information. We are not going to allow a
situation where we are just going to be pushing merely because we want to
satisfy the egos and whims of the Sheilas ... [Interjections.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Madam Speaker, will the hon the Minister take a question?

The SPEAKER: Order! Minister, will you take a question?

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, the hon member should have gone to my press
briefing yesterday. Everybody was free to ask questions there. We are not
going to be listening to and satisfying the whims of the Sheilas and the
Tonys of this world, who are now the leaders of this party here, and who
never bothered to ask Vorster and Vlok.

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Vorster's dead now, and I used to ask Vlok.

The MINISTER: He is leading you from the grave. [Laughter.] That is why you
are so ``deurmekaar'' [confused].

We are never going to allow that kind of situation to develop. Those
members never asked the NP government about any statistics and they were
content with that situation. Some of them were praise singers of the
tyrannical machinery of the SA Defence Force. They were there, serving
them, and they never bothered to question them about statistics.
[Applause.] Now they want statistics, because they are abusing ...
[Interjections.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: It is your job! [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon Minister, your time has expired. [Applause.]
The DEPUTY MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Madam Speaker, the IFP is approaching
this debate with a keen awareness that South Africa has now reached a
crucial point at which the elements of our possible future success must be
brought together, kept together and aimed in the direction of victory. If
we fail to do it now, we will be remembered as those who snatched defeat
from the jaws of victory.

The social and economic picture portrayed to us by the President in his
state of the nation address points out that a lot has been done to move the
country forward towards the intended goal of generalised and equitable
social stability and economic prosperity. However, the President has also
pointed out that a lot remains to be done to achieve this goal.

During his address of last year, the President indicated that our country
was on course and at work. This year he told us about the progress made and
the chartered course we intend to pursue. We share the same objectives and,
with a few exceptions, we support the course and direction adopted. They
are in fact those that the IFP has advocated for many years and
consistently pursued through its political action in government and at
grass-roots level.
However, we have concerns and reservations about the pace at which we are
moving along our chosen path and the techniques and instruments we use to
make progress. Our achievements cannot be measured against the levels of
the needs we must satisfy, for against such benchmarks we are always bound
to fall short. However, our achievements must be evaluated against the full
measure of speed, efficiency, integrity and efficacy with which we operate.
Measured against this, we must critically accept that our results still
fall short and that what we have not done which we could have done, still
overshadows our achievements. We need the motivated contribution of all to
do more, better and faster.

The President has mentioned the restructuring of state assets in certain
critical fields such as telecommunications. This is an example of where we
could have done more from the beginning and where what we plan to do still
remains insufficient until we have enabled the full liberalisation of this
segment of our economy to enable South Africa to acquire and produce
services which can keep up with rapidly growing international standards.

The entire issue of privatisation, unfortunately, remains one of the fields
in which our policy initiatives in Government action have underperformed.
We could identify other areas where similar considerations could apply. For
instance the IFP greatly appreciates the emphasis the President has placed
on combining the macroeconomic focus of economic growth with the
microeconomic approach, which calls for bottom-up development stemming from
community work, self-help and self-reliance.

For two decades the IFP has placed emphasis especially on the need to
promote the microeconomic level, starting from our communities, by
empowering ordinary people to become the engines of bottom-up development.
For two decades we have pointed out that social development is also
economic development. We further argued that in our context our economy
grows every time the basic social conditions of our people improve. In this
respect we could also point out how much of what has been done can be done
better and increased in quantity by drawing more on the experience and
political philosophy of the IFP, which combines the emphasis on development
with the belief that more can be achieved by empowering people,
decentralising, liberalising and stimulating rather than controlling.
However, it is not our intention to place the Government at the coolface of
criticism, nor to work against a Government in which we proudly
participate. Our commitment is that of working within Government to improve
on governance. But in order to do so, we must acknowledge the realities and
shortcomings of governance in South Africa and have the confidence and
serenity to debate them openly. We need to create a climate in which
shortcomings may be pointed out as constructive criticism levelled by all
sides with the earnest intention of making a contribution. It should also
be received with the greatness and humility of someone who knows that under
the dramatic circumstances of our country, no one and nothing is beyond
improvement and everyone's contribution is needed.

The debate on the President's speech is a debate about the Presidency and
the leadership that the Presidency has given to the country in the
governance of South Africa. We therefore wish to avoid focusing on policy
details in respect of which we may differ or which we may see as open to
further contributions from all sides. We would rather place emphasis on the
tone and overall policy profile of the President's state of the nation
address. In this respect we must express our full satisfaction on how the
President has introduced this debate and the tone and policy profile with
which he seems to be approaching the arduous task of governing the country
this year. It is an approach which enables us to confront the many crises
with which our country is seized.

The harsh reality is that there are many crises which need to be turned
into challenges and then into opportunities. We need a collegial and
inspired leadership which can bring about the difficult alchemy of
transforming crises into opportunities. The IFP wishes to be one of the
catalysts of this alchemy, working together with Government to produce
lateral thinking and innovative solutions to see how we can turn around
even what seems to be an insoluble crisis.

To us the most important part of the President's speech is that which
infuses the confidence that we can change any crisis which the country is
now confronting if we change our attitudes. Some of us are our own worst
enemies when we fall prey to unjustified pessimism and a cannot-do
attitude. To us the most important portion of the President's address is
that which suggests a take-charge and can-do attitude, which can indeed
turn around crises into opportunities and break the vicious cycle of
impotence and hopelessness in our communities up to the highest levels of
government.

The crisis which is causing us most concern is the crisis of delivery which
was highlighted by the results of the local government elections, in which
large segments of those who were entitled to vote opted not to vote - a
mere six years after the enthusiasm and glory of a liberation election.
This is a sign of discontent we dare not ignore. It spells out a problem
within the governance of South Africa which must be acknowledged.

We believe that the President's speech is the key to addressing these
crises, as it places emphasis on turning discontent into initiatives at
community level, in which people can bring about change and progress
through their own efforts and initiatives. The IFP is eager to make this
contribution and become a catalyst to bring to the fore anyone else who can
help turn crises into opportunities.

The tone of the President's speech suggests that this is the time to build
bridges so that we can begin to trust anyone who is willing to help. If we
recognise that we are in a crisis, as the country still is, we cannot
reject contributions just because they do not come from within our own
inner circles. On the other hand, if someone comes to help put out a fire,
he should carry water like everyone else, rather than nit-pick over the
water which may be spilled by those who rush to the rescue.

We should not polarise the solution of the crisis confronting the country
into an artificial division between Government and opposition, between
black and white, between rich and poor or urban and rural. We will need
many bridges across these many divides. We have our identity, our
entrenched policies and political philosophies and, without the need to
change them, we need to use them in building bridges and become a bridge
ourselves whenever necessary. Bridges must be built from both banks.

It is necessary to transform negativism, pessimism and pure unproductive
criticism into constructive contributions, proposals and then to work with
Government for governance, for the benefit of the community as a whole
rather than merely against Government for short-term party political gain.
[Applause.]

Ms N N MAPISA-NQAKULA: Madam Speaker, Mr President, Mr Deputy President and
hon members, just over 45 years ago the ANC placed on the national agenda
in South Africa a political programme that was designed to transform the
country into a democratic dispensation of equal opportunity and
responsibility, of nonracism and nonsexism, and of freedom, peace and
justice.

The programme, spelt out in the historic Freedom Charter, was immediately
attacked by those who were opposed to change as a communist plot to subvert
the authority of the apartheid regime. Even those who claimed to be liberal
rejected the charter which political scholars depicted, and continue to do
so even now, as one of the best foundations for a better future for this
country's citizens, their children and their grandchildren. In fact,
reference to the document became a treasonable offence.

History will not be kind to those South Africans across the colour divide
who refused to be party to the congress of the people in 1955, despite
invitations from the ANC to formulate a policy that would have created the
necessary conditions for a better life for all our people. Had we all
seized the opportunity as a people we would have avoided the subsequent
years of strife and tribulation.

I know that there are some fellow human beings who do not like it when we
recall this history, but we need to recall our past in order to understand
our present and secure our future. The painful memories of the past will
not become our nightmare. Instead, they will become our lodestar to a
better life for all, and will prevent a relapse into that terrible past, if
we continue to consolidate our democracy. I would like to tell Mr Van
Schalkwyk that when all is said and done, the democracy that we are
enjoying at this time was defined in the Freedom Charter.

Consolidating our democracy means the fulfilment of our democratic goals.
It means we must accelerate our transformation programme. The ANC's
democratisation programme is anchored around the establishment of a strong,
efficient developmental state which will use the resources at its command
to meet the needs of all the people, especially the poor. We move closer to
the completion of the building of the developmental state by strengthening
local government, as Comrade President asked us to do when he opened this
session of Parliament last Friday.
Umkhomba-ndlela oqulathwe kuSomqulu weNkululeko othi `` abantu baya
kulawula'' uya kuzalisekiswa xa amaqumrhu asekuhlaleni (ward committees)
emiselwe. Ngawona aza kwenza uqhakgamshelwano nonxulumano phakathi koluntu,
ekuhlaleni kwakunye nooceba (councillors). Ke, nawo amalungu ePalamente
anoxanduva lokuba yinxalenye yokwakha nokuqinisa la maqumrhu. (Translation
of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[The meaning of the clause in the Freedom Charter that says: ``The people
shall govern'', will be realised when ward committees have been
established. These ward committees will provide for good communication
between communities and councillors. Members of Parliament have a
responsibility to be part of them so as to strengthen them.]

Our people will not just be the end users and consumers of the services
that local government structures will deliver. They will be part of the
decision-making processes, and, in keeping with the policy of the ANC, will
be at the centre of the task of building our developmental state. They will
be organised for this task wherever they might be - at their workplaces,
sports organisations, churches, schools and so on - so that as a united
people, who are united in action for change, as Comrade President said,
they set forth to defeat hunger, homelessness, and all the diseases that
are the direct result of ignorance.

We have covered a lot of ground, from the days of our negotiations at the
World Trade Centre, in building our young democracy. It is a mark of our
collective belief in our common destiny that we have moved with such speed
in transforming the lives of our people and the face of our country. Our
very first act of transformation was to abolish apartheid and give freedom
to all our people. We said in the words of the Freedom Charter:


  South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and no
  government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of
  all the people.

It was through the will of the people that we articulated the interim
Constitution and the electoral law that gave us the first-ever democratic
election in our country in 1994. It was the will of the people that took us
to the finalisation of our Constitution which political scholars have
described as one of the most progressive in the world.

A number of developments have taken place over the past decade. Admittedly,
a lot more needs to happen before we can say we have satisfied all the
requirements of our democratic transformation. Indeed, there are people who
still suffer from want, poverty, homelessness, and preventable diseases.
There are many, especially within the African community, who are
illiterate. But some who were landless yesterday have land today. Some of
those who relied on wood and cow dung for energy have electricity now. Some
of those who have shared the water in our rivers and streams with animals
have clean drinking water. It is, obviously, not enough. More must be done,
as Comrade President told us on Friday, and more will be done this year to
bring more services to our people, especially those who live in the
countryside, where basic facilities were a rare commodity in the past. The
provision of the new service will result, in many instances, in the
creation of jobs for the jobless.

Isimemelelo asenze ngoLwesihlanu uMongameli sinika ingqiniseko yokuvulwa
kwamathuba emisebenzi kwabo bangekho ngqeshweni. [The provision of the new
service that the hon President talked about on Friday, gives the assurance
that there will be the creation of jobs for the jobless.]
Our World Trade Centre peace talks will go into the annals of our history
as the time when we came to our senses and pulled back our people from the
abyss of self-destruction. The international experience is by and large
different from what happened in our country. Transitions elsewhere became
an orgy of blood-letting of serious proportions. We should never forget
that it was in the main the representatives of the struggling masses of our
people who were prepared to make concessions to take forward the
negotiation process.

We knew that there would be side effects. We knew that we would create a
bloated Public Service as a consequence of the sunset clauses. The
leadership knew that some of the agreements would not be popular with the
masses. But, all the weaknesses of the negotiated settlement pale into
insignificance when compared to the bloodshed that would have been our lot
had we not done what we did.

We need to build on this experience and establish a firm programme of
nation-building that will be pervaded by an abiding sense of oneness. There
are many people of goodwill out there who will participate unreservedly in
such a project. Those are people who believe in our country and who want to
be part of the building blocks of a new country and a new nation. They are
proud to be called agents of change.

Among these are white farmers who go out of their way to help develop black
farmers in their neighbourhood. They are white teachers who organise
classes for black children and their parents to defeat illiteracy. They are
white business people who help their black fellow human beings to enter the
economic mainstream as equal participants in the transformation of that
sector. In doing so, they are contributing towards the demolition of the
economic walls that kept this country's wealth in the hands of the few.

Unfortunately, these stories do not hit the headlines regularly. They are
deliberately ignored. Fortunately, those who render the services do so out
of conviction and a deep sense of commitment and do so while not seeking
publicity for themselves. Their commendable advances contribute to the
ideal of affirmative action. The ANC has always recognised that affirmative
action does not mean that the principles of diversity and capacity building
should not be used to promote and advance the interests of our people. Our
democracy is based on equal citizenship, equal opportunity, equal
protection and equal responsibility. However, the process of raising our
people to the same level is very difficult. In the circumstances,
affirmative action is a necessary instrument to address inequality.

The challenges that we face are formidable. Those who want us to fail will
accelerate their programme of destabilisation but the forces for change are
strong under the strong and respected leadership of our President. They
will complete the work of transforming our country where selfless service
to the people will be the norm. We will meet the challenges to educate and
train our people for development. We will raise the country's standard of
living and we will provide a better life for all.

This is what the President has committed himself to and the whole world
recognises the potential that South Africa has under his leadership. Our
peace-loving people - remembering the stipulation in the Freedom Charter
that our country will never be prosperous until all our people live in
brotherhood, enjoying equal rights and opportunities; and that only a
democratic state, based on the will of the people, can secure to all their
birthright without distinction of colour, race, sex and belief - will unite
in action for change as requested by Comrade President. [Applause.]

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Madam Speaker, all of us would like South Africa to
succeed. All of us here would like to ensure that when it is our children's
turn to take over the reins of power in this country, they will inherit a
successful country and a proud nation based on optimism.

The desire to succeed in our country cuts across all the divisions. We must
keep that flame alight. Sometimes that flame is dimmed but the potential is
there to reignite it and channel the desire for excellence. Similarly,
there is also a deep-seated patriotism that needs to be nurtured.

If we talk about stumbling blocks that we must still overcome, fault lines
in our nation that we must address, this must always be done against the
background of the successes that we have had up to now. Special efforts are
needed in our country, with its history and the make-up of our nation. We
must avoid a situation in this country, where the people of the country
unite and work together while the leaders are still squabbling and creating
artificial divisions.
If we look at how apartheid came into being, it was a process which was
laid, brick by brick, over many decades. The foundation for it was laid in
earlier centuries. Then another layer was added and another law was passed
and, eventually, we were left with this whole edifice. One looks back and
asks oneself: How did we get here?

This is comparable to what we find today and what many people experience
with regard to racial polarisation. Let me tell you how we experienced the
debate on race and the two nations concept. It started out with incidents
like the so-called campfire song, the hon member Peter Mokaba's ``kill the
boer, kill the farmer''. That was followed by remarks such as those by the
hon member Mluleki George in 1998, the introduction of racial quota laws in
almost all spheres of life and, eventually, we are confronted with the
formal concept of ``We are two nations. One black and one white.''
[Interjections.]

One asks oneself: How did we get here? Because we were not supposed to end
up here. How did we end up in a situation, once again, where some people
feel that there are first-class citizens and there are second-class
citizens, with race being reintroduced as the determinant of one's status
in the nation?

In the hon the President's speech on Friday, he said:


  We share a common destiny from which none of us can escape because,
  together, we are human, we are South African, we are African.

If this means that the hon the President has now abandoned the two-nations
concept, then it means ...

The MINISTER IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT: no!

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Mr Pahad says no. Then it means that all the
ingredients are there to restart the process of reconciliation. Maybe Mr
Pahad should stop speaking for the President. It will only do good in this
country. [Interjections.]

The cement that binds the wall that some people wanted to erect between the
two artificially defined nations is still wet. The hon the President will
find many hands on this side of the House willing to assist in tearing down
that wall and willing to use all our energy in building one South African
nation.

We are encouraged by the hon the President's undertakings to play his role
as President, to share a common destiny. I have to remind the hon the
President that on 10 June 1997, he proposed the concept of a national
agenda and a national consensus on certain national issues. The hon the
President said, and I quote (Hansard 1997, col 3645):


  ... we as a people must travel together as the new Voortrekkers.

Regrettably, not much came of that. On 10 November 1998, in the NCOP, the
hon the President talked about a common nationhood that we share in this
country, but two years later, the concept of two separate nations was
introduced. So, if this time around the hon the President truly commits
himself as we do, to share a common destiny from which none of us can
escape because together we are human, we are South African and we are
African, then there must be a new sense of urgency and of action.

If it had not been for the vicious attack in the latest edition of the
ANC's newly launched publication, the ANC Today. I would not have referred,
today, to my visits to the Pietermaritzburg station, the Cradock Four
Cenotaph and Chief Albert Luthuli's hometown. After the initial welcome of
the visits by a national ANC spokesperson, the vindictive and venomous
attack certainly requires a response. The essence is that all leaders at
all levels, from all political persuasions, have a duty in this country to
contribute towards reconciliation if they are true patriots.

For myself, I would like to say that unfounded criticism will certainly not
deter me. Well-intentioned criticism I welcome. The problem with the kind
of attack launched by the ANC yesterday in that publication is that the
message to many South Africans out there who want to reach out to their
fellow South Africans is ``You are damned if you do and damned if you do
not''. [Interjections.]

People are criticised in this country for not doing enough for
reconciliation, but when they do, the ANC's propaganda machine rolls into
action in an attempt to discredit everything that is not according to an
ANC script. 'n Ruimheid van gees [A generosity of spirit], which people
always thought was the hallmark of the ANC when it comes to the issue of
reconciliation, has been replaced by a vindictiveness and narrowmindedness
from some quarters.

People are free and should be free to join whichever party they support and
identify with. In that regard, I have been struck by the bitter criticism
by some of the white ANC members and supporters in recent news reports. I
would specifically like to exclude people like Mr Alec Erwin, Mr Kasrils,
Mr Momberg and others.

However, one cannot escape the impression that some members of the ANC have
appointed themselves as gatekeepers and high priests, attempting to
monopolise the moral authority to decide whose reconciliation is genuine
and whose is not. These self-appointed gatekeepers are more of a hindrance
than a help to the process of reconciliation.

What these self-appointed gatekeepers must understand is that success in
the new South Africa will only be achieved if all of us, from different
backgrounds and different political histories, work together to make South
Africa a success. South Africa cannot succeed if only those who were part
of the struggle of one political party are allowed through the gates.

We want Government to rule with all races, for all races and not against
any race. We want to belong to one nation, and not to two. And Government,
therefore, must be for all the people. Government must not ever be - or
become - a narrow partisan activity. Mr S'bu Ndebele, leader of the ANC in
KwaZulu-Natal, said in December:


  To all Africans, coloureds and Indians who voted for the DA, be warned
  there is going to be consequences for not voting for the ANC. When it
  comes to service delivery we will start with the people who voted for us,
  the ANC, and you will be last.

[Interjections.] He, too, remains high in the saddle, securely in place and
unreprimanded by his party or his leader. Yet this is a monstrous
subversion of democracy. This is a fundamental breach of our contract. This
is a denial of the achievement which has made us all proudly democratic
South Africans.

The ability to hold the Government accountable and the ability to criticise
it, are two vital building blocks of a healthy democracy. Unfortunately,
criticism of this Government is often seen as unpatriotic, disloyal and
racist. We just have to look at the latest tolerance of the hon Ministers
Tshwete and Maduna directed against the Portuguese community. Earlier the
Chief Whip of the ANC said it was a priority for the ANC to fight
xenophobia. And now?

Kaizer Nyatsumba recently referred in an article to what he called -


  ... a crisis of confidence, where more and more people across the colour
  line increasingly take whatever the Government says with much more than a
  pinch of salt.

These are strong words. Mr Nyatsumba makes a very telling point by
observing that -


  ... the vast majority of those criticising the President and the
  Government love their country deeply, are fully committed to it, and they
  do so out of exasperation and in the hope that their criticism would be
  taken seriously and that it would make a difference.

Certainly, the hon the President will agree that these are patriotic
sentiments.

Let us also talk about credibility. In his speech, the President talked
about intensifying the fight against corruption, but in practice we are
confronted with the Heath unit saga and the Feinstein incident. The
question to the President is: Where is the credibility?

A second example is contained in the President's speech on Friday in which
he said:


  During the past year, the economy also continued to improve in an
  impressive manner.

To substantiate this, the President quoted from the December 2000 Quarterly
Bulletin of the SA Reserve Bank, but he omitted the important but more
sobering aspects contained in the same bulletin, for instance -


  ... the formal labour market recorded a further decline in employment
  numbers in the first half of 2000.

And:


  ... foreign investment in real sector job creating projects remained low.

I wish to ask the President: Where is the credibility?

Thirdly, we were promised a renewed fight against crime but what we got was
a veil of secrecy over the crime statistics. Where is the credibility?

Fourthly, our Constitution promises accountability of Government to the
elected representatives of the people, namely this Parliament. But more and
more we see the steady and calculated erosion of parliamentary
accountability. Where is the credibility?

When we say: Look at the whole picture, both the good and the bad, it is
not talking down the country as the President said in his interview on
Sunday. It is rather a case of levelling with the country.
Mevrou die Speaker, wat betref lewering, begin meer en meer Suid-Afrikaners
vra: Watter party aan bewind, kan sy beloftes uitvoer en die dienste lewer
wat die mense graag wil hê? Dit is goed vir Suid-Afrika dat daar plaaslike
en provinsiale regerings is wat in die hande is van meer as een party,
sodat mense in die toekoms partye se rekords van toe hulle aan bewind was,
met mekaar kan vergelyk.

In die Wes-Kaap waar ons die regering vorm, was die matriekslaagsyfer 80%.
Die tweede plek word beklee deur 'n provinsie met 13% minder as dit, terwyl
die nasionale gemiddeld staan op 58%. Die ekonomiese groei in die Wes-Kaap
is ver hoër as die nasionale gemiddeld. Die Wes-Kaap het die laagste
werkloosheidsyfer in Suid-Afrika en dit het die grondslag gelê vir die feit
dat die Wes-Kaap nou vir twee jaar agtereenvolgens die PMR-toekenning gekry
het vir die besbestuurde provinsie.

Die patrone van verlede jaar se plaaslike regeringsverkiesing het begin
uitwys dat goeie regeringsbestuur ou lojaliteite begin inhaal wanneer mense
hul kruisie trek. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Madam Speaker, with regard to delivery, more and more South Africans are
beginning to ask: Which party in power can execute its promises and deliver
the services that people would like to have? It is good for South Africa
that there are local and provincial governments in the hands of more than
one party, so that people will in future be able to compare the records of
parties when they were in power.

In the Western Cape, where we form the Government, the matric pass rate was
80%. The second place is filled by a province with 13% less than that,
whilst the national average is 58%. The economic growth in the Western Cape
is far higher than the national average. The Western Cape has the lowest
unemployment rate in South Africa, and this is the foundation for the fact
that the Western Cape has now, for two consecutive years, received the PMR
Award for the best managed province.

The patterns of last year's local government election have begun to
indicate that good governance is starting to overtake old loyalties when
people cast their vote.]

In conclusion, the DA said last week that the relationship between itself
and the Government should be one of constructive co-operation. For
constructive co-operation to work to the advantage of all the people, the
governing party must show a willingness to engage the opposition. It is not
helpful if the Government, despite its large majority, feels so insecure
that it is oversensitive to criticism and suggestions.

Too many people in the ANC cannot distinguish between so-called ``counter-
revolutionary behaviour'' and true patriotism. The DA is a party for all
people. It is a party born out of true patriotism. [Interjections.] The
time has arrived to act on Mr Mandela's advice that true patriots in all
parties - the good men and women - must stand up to make this country a
success. [Applause.]

Mr J H MOMBERG: Madam Speaker, Mr President, Mr Deputy President, I did not
intend to react to the hon Mr Van Schalkwyk's visit to Cradock and KwaZulu-
Natal. May I say to Mr Van Schalkwyk that there is no anti-feeling because
he has visited these areas. The feeling, however, is that he went there to
gain cheap political points. [Interjections.]

If he had gone to those areas on his own and not with an entourage and a
small train, he would have achieved much more. In 1992 I went to Cradock at
the invitation of Comrade Goniwe. I sat with the widows of the Cradock
Four. In 1985 I was one of the people who perpetrated crimes against those
people. I went to those widows and said to them that we were sorry for what
we did to their husbands. I did not take reporters and photographers along
with me. I think it should be welcomed that the hon Van Schalkwyk went to
Cradock and KwaZulu-Natal. However, the issue is that he went there to gain
cheap political points. [Applause.]

I want to thank the hon the President for the dignified way in which he has
led our country over the past years, despite the most vicious campaign ever
conducted against a leader of this country. I suppose it says a lot for our
democracy that it tolerates such vilification. Not even at the height of
the Botha repressive years did political parties and leaders ever stoop as
low as we have experienced over the past year.

I believe that a major contributing factor to this campaign of vilification
is the unexpressed opinion, mostly of whites, that, because the President
is black, he is not supposed to be a good president. Therefore, it is in
order for every Tom, Dick and Harry to vilify, misinterpret and misquote
him. [Interjections.] They were part of those people who left an almost
bankrupt Third World South Africa to the ANC in 1994. Now they seem to be
angry at the President for not waving a magic wand to turn us into a First
World country.

I want to deal today with the debate concerning the declaration of
commitment by white South Africans which was initiated by Carl Niehaus and
Mary Burton on 16 December 2000. It is crucial that we all understand
exactly what the declaration entails. It seems as if many people
misunderstand this declaration on purpose in order for them not to sign it.

The declaration makes no reference to an apology and does not infer that
anybody is guilty of a criminal deed. It merely states that whites
acknowledge that apartheid caused massive social, economic, cultural and
psychological damage to black South Africans. It commits whites to
redressing these wrongs. That is all it is.

Die verklaring vra dat blankes moet erken dat die blanke gemeenskap as
geheel verantwoordelik was vir die instelling en instandhouding van
apartheid. Geen blanke kan tog weier om sodanige erkentenis te maak nie.
Ons weet mos dat apartheid uitbuitend en onderdrukkend van aard was, dat
blankes die stelsel geskep en in stand gehou het ...

'n AGB LID: Jy het hom geskep.

Mnr J H MOMBERG: ... dat blankes deur die stelsel bevoordeel is en swartes
daardeur benadeel is, dat 'n groot deel van die swartes steeds onder die
nadele van apartheid gebuk gaan en dat blanke bevoordeeldes steeds die
voordele daarvan geniet.

Enige blanke wat eerlik en opreg gewillig is om die waarheid oor ons
apartheidsverlede vierkantig in die oë te kyk, het geen ander keuse as om
met hierdie verklaring saam te stem nie. Mense wat nie bereid is om hierdie
opsigtelike waarhede rondom apartheid te erken nie, is hardvogtig,
selfsugtig en kortsigtig.

Die onreg wat oor 300 jaar teenoor swartmense gepleeg is deur die stelsels
van kolonialisme en apartheid is waarskynlik so groot dat dit nie deur ons
geslag volledig reggestel kan word nie. Soveel te meer is dit ons plig om
te erken dat 'n onreg gepleeg is en dat ons ons vir die onmiddellike
regstelling daarvan sal beywer. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[The declaration asks that whites acknowledge that the white community as a
whole was responsible for the creation and maintenance of apartheid. Surely
no white person could refuse to make such an admission. Surely we know that
apartheid was exploitative and repressive, that whites created and
maintained the system ...

An HON MEMBER: You created it.

Mr J H MOMBERG: ... that whites benefited from the system and that blacks
were prejudiced by it, that a large number of blacks are still suffering
the disadvantages of apartheid and that privileged whites are still
enjoying its advantages.

Any white who is honestly and sincerely willing to face up squarely to the
truth about our apartheid past has no choice but to agree with this
declaration. People who are not prepared to acknowledge these conspicuous
truths concerning apartheid are callous, selfish and shortsighted.

The injustice that black people have been done over 300 years by the
systems of colonialism and apartheid is apparently so huge that it cannot
be fully rectified by our generation. It is all the more our duty to admit
that an injustice was committed and that we will strive for its immediate
rectification.]

It is funny: I thought that now that the hon Leader of the Opposition has
got married, he would at least look friendly, but he is still unfriendly.
[Interjections.] [Laughter.]

Die vraag ontstaan of hierdie regstelling vrywillig moet wees of deur
staatsoptrede behoort te geskied. 'n Magdom apartheidswette is van 1910 tot
1970 deur die blanke parlement in die Wetboek geplaas. Aangesien die
uitbuiting dus statutêr was, behoort die billike regstelling daarvan ook
statutêr te wees. Dit is my oortuiging dat die Parlement volle
verantwoordelikheid vir restitusie sal moet aanvaar.

Dit tref my dat jongmense dikwels geneig is om te sê: ``Maar ons het geen
aandeel aan apartheid gehad nie.'' Niemand verkwalik hulle daarvoor nie,
maar dit is dieselfde jongmense wat gretiglik die voordele wat apartheid
aan hul ouers en grootouers gebied het, aanvaar as deel van hul eiendom.
Hulle moet 'n slag gaan stilstaan en besef daardie voordele is nie so
verdiend soos hulle graag wil hê dit moet wees nie. Die voordele vanweë
kolonialisme en apartheid oor 'n tydperk van 300 jaar in wit hande, is nie
so verdiend soos wat baie blankes graag wil glo nie. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The question arises whether this rectification should be voluntary or
whether it should take place through state action. A myriad of apartheid
laws were placed on the Statute Book by the white parliament between 1910
and 1970. Since the exploitation was therefore statutory its fair
rectification should also be statutory. It is my conviction that Parliament
should accept full responsibility for restitution.

It strikes me that young people often tend to say: ``But we had no part in
apartheid.'' No one blames them for this, but these are the same young
people who eagerly accept the benefits that apartheid brought their parents
and grandparents as part of their property. They should stop for a moment
and realise that those benefits are not as deserved as they would like them
to be. The benefits arising from colonialism and apartheid over a period of
300 years which are in white hands are not as deserved as many whites would
like to believe.]

It is therefore with a feeling of despair that I witnessed the reaction of
some leaders of the DA to this declaration. The hon the Chief Whip of the
DP, Mr Douglas Gibson, earned himself the title: ``Mampara of the Week'',
for his astonishing statement:


  I am not going to say I am sorry that I am white, I am not responsible
  for apartheid, and I do not think I benefited from apartheid.

What utter rubbish! [Interjections.] [Applause.] I am not even going to
talk about the pathetic response of the hon Dene Smuts. [Interjections.] A
lot was said about the visits of the hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk. I believe
that if the hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk had signed that declaration, he
would have made a far greater impact than by going to those places.
[Interjections.]

In conclusion, may I say that only when whites accept the fact that they
were beneficiaries of apartheid, and that blacks were the victims, will we
be able to start building a true nation. As Carl Niehaus once said:


  An unalienable characteristic of apartheid was self-promotion and pride.
  However, in the new South Africa it is demanded of us whites to learn
  what it means to be modest, to integrate in our very existence a real
  sense of humility. One must be prepared to confess one's guilt without
  preconditions, and be prepared to correct one's mistakes.

On behalf of those whites who are prepared to admit to their share of the
evils of apartheid, I say to you: Continue on your road to building one
nation, we will be right behind you. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, hon President, Deputy President and hon
members, we in the UDM recognise the President's speech as a restatement of
the positive aspects of Government policy which seek to build a united
nation, alleviate poverty, build a domestic skills capacity, stimulate
economic growth, etc. We are in full agreement with most of what the
President had to say in this regard. We also commend the President for his
realistic approach in terms of which he set achievable goals.

We recognise those achievements which the Government believes represent
their commitment to deliver on their past promises. [Interjections.]
However, the President will have a difficult task convincing the multitudes
of the unemployed and disillusioned school-leavers who are cynically
beginning to believe that our education system is delivering a generation
of unemployable misfits, that there have been improvements in the economic
situation. It is also not reassuring to our poor millions that there have
been real increases in incomes, as the President has claimed. If there have
been any, it would be necessary to quantify them and show in what sections
of the population these gains have been experienced.

We have also sensed a recognition, by the President, that all is not well
with the Gear policy. For the first time he has made reference to
microeconomic strategies. It is hoped this train of thought will be
developed further, in order to identify practical measures to deal with
unemployment and job creation on the ground.

The President touched on the crime crisis, and was not convincing in
defending the Minister of Safety and Security's gagging of the publication
of crime statistics. He also did not cover any ground-breaking proposals on
how crime should be reined in.

Any attempt to downplay crime levels in the country would be grossly
misleading the South African public. Political expediency must not be
allowed to deny the gravity of the crime situation, neither should wishful
thinking impair our judgment and militate against Government resolve to
take responsible decisions and adopt effective measures to deal with
criminals decisively, as well as create an environment conducive to
security and safety. Wishful platitudes depicting decreasing crime levels
are hurtful to the kith and kin of crime victims who have been mugged and
murdered in their driveways, gunned down or raped in their homes as well as
the hundreds of victims of antiwitchcraft purges and ethnic cleansing in
the rural communities.

We welcome the current vibrant public debate on arms procurement and can
state categorically that democracy has been a winner in this process,
because our country and the world witnessed a free expression of ideas by
different political parties. It is no exaggeration that our democracy was
effectively tested. Government must now ensure that this debate is brought
to a conclusion so that its integrity and credibility does not continue to
be questioned as is currently the case.

Government should not be seen or perceived to be protecting and defending
perpetrators of corruption. The public is justified in believing that the
executive is doing just that because it has been instrumental in generating
the current tension between itself and the legislature over the arms
procurement probe. It is cause for concern when the President and his
executive demonstrate so much anger and hostility at the prospect of the
involvement of the Heath Special Investigative Unit in the probe, as
originally recommended by Parliament.

At this juncture the UDM would like to call for the following cautionary
measures in the hope that they will assist the process. We call for honesty
and sincerity from members of this House by adhering to decisions once they
have been taken. It is especially important for the role of our Parliament
in its oversight responsibility that it is not forced to play a subversive
role against its own members. We have individually and collectively, from
the Speaker of the House to a member of the smallest party, a moral and
legal responsibility to protect our democracy and all the independent
institutions against any kind of intrusion from the executive. We must
govern by legislation, not by regulation.

The current debate on arms procurement, the participation in it by members
of the Cabinet, the Presidency and political parties, public institutions
and the Speaker of the House, have focused attention on the issue of the
separation of powers and the supremacy of our Constitution more than ever
before in our new democracy, and we dare not falter. It is unfortunate that
in this debate the role of some participants is perceived to be dubious and
ambiguous, to say the least.

The vibrancy exhibited by the media and individuals in this debate clearly
indicates that our democracy is at its best. But it is unfortunate that the
issues causing the exciting vibrancy have been cleverly clowded so that the
debate appears to be about the hon Mrs De Lille, her alleged attack on our
Government and the resulting demonisation of this member of Parliament by
the all-powerful ruling party that appears too nervous to let the course of
the investigation go uninterrupted. [Interjections.]

The outcome is that the public is misled into thinking that the debate is
about the hon Mrs De Lille, Judge Heath and the President, when in reality
it is about the Auditor-General's report which was tabled last year.
Therefore, for the executive to publicly castigate and challenge the
authority of the Auditor-General without engaging his office is tantamount
to rejecting the authority of our very Constitution.

It was this report that led Scopa to recommend to this House that an
investigation mechanism be created to look into the awarding of tenders in
the procurement processes and whether any conflict of interest existed.
Inevitably, the existence of any conflict of interest would have to
indicate whether the beneficiaries thereof were certain members of the
executive, friends or relatives of the executive, certain military
personnel, the ruling party itself and individuals in the ruling party.

Last year all parties in this House accepted the brief and the terms of
reference on the investigation. However, if one reads the letter from the
Presidency emanating from the Deputy President and utterances by some
Cabinet Ministers, it becomes clear that they are questioning the
parliamentary consensus on the desirability of the investigation.

This situation has been exacerbated by the actions of the Speaker of this
House when she joined the bashing of Scopa by the executive without giving
the chairperson of that committee a hearing. In addition, and perhaps most
importantly, the President himself has cast aspersions on those who have
shown a passionate interest in this investigation as if they were not
interested South Africans, but hostile foreigners with a subversive agenda
against our very national interests.

The behaviour of the executive in the arms procurement saga instructs us to
be vigilant and cautious of their willingness to respect and uphold our
constitutional bodies that are put in place to protect and entrench
democracy in our society. For example, despite the continuous revelations
by the media that intricate networks of friends, relatives and business
partners,  closely linked to some of the executive members, have ties to
the arms industry, the executive has not challenged these allegations. The
fact that these allegations go unchallenged, even though they contradict
the executive's own statements on arms procurement, is further proof that
the credibility of the executive is questionable on this matter.

From our point of view we cannot discount the executive's role in forcing
the ANC to renege on a parliamentary decision to establish four units -
including the Heath Special Investigating Unit - to investigate, and
instead demand that only three units be established. What the ANC cannot
explain is how they obtained the mandate to reject a parliamentary
resolution and replace it with a new one that is favourable to them.

A close scrutiny of the players involved in the arms procurement saga
indicates that there is a cabal of clever manipulators who are holding our
highly respected leaders in the struggle to ransom and are thus able to
drive empty companies under the guise of black economic empowerment. It is
the same group that has embarrassed this country in the third cellular
licence saga.

The important question for us is: In what other transactions is this cabal
involved? Could it be the same group that was paid some R100 million by
Government to secure an arms deal between South Africa and Saudi Arabia?
Has the same cabal donated millions to any political party in South Africa?
How I wish we could widen the terms of reference to also include their
involvement in the cellular licence saga, so that the people who seem
hellbent on looting the resources of this country could be brought to book.

Some of the people involved in these cabals are friends and relatives of
some of the executive members. Since the Auditor-General's report on arms
procurement cites a conflict of interest, the executive, which presided
over the proceedings in the allocation of tenders, cannot investigate
itself and therefore Parliament must devise a mechanism such as a judicial
commission or the four units, as agreed, to undertake a wider, credible
investigation of the place and role of some of the executive members in the
networks behind the arms procurement deals. The media, without any denial
from the ruling party, has come out with names of relatives and close
associates of some prominent executive members who are alleged to have
benefited in the awarding of arms procurement tenders.

This, in our view and in the minds of many South Africans, amounts to a
conflict of interest where these politicians are concerned. It reinforces
the suspicion that the executive has something to hide, which explains the
scurrilous accusations levelled at the Heath Special Investigating Unit,
Scopa and the Auditor-General. The executive, and the President in
particular, owe it to the RSA to keep their hands off the probe and allow
unfettered investigation to get to the root of the problem. If the
executive is aware that some of their relatives and associates are involved
in some of the bidding companies, common decency obliges them to recuse
themselves from any decision-making process where the granting of tenders
in the procurement of arms is concerned.

The executive cannot set conditions for its own investigations, because it
is the subject of this investigation and therefore has no moral or
constitutional standing to insist on any preconditions. In view of the fact
that they have already excluded the Heath Special Investigating Unit, which
alone has the power to cancel any tainted contracts, they are under a
compelling obligation to review their earlier decision.

[I heard the hon the Minister of Communications making a noise, too. She
still has not resolved the issue of the granting of the licence for the
third cellular network. We want her to investigate the arms deal saga as
well as those people involved in the granting of this third cellular
network licence.]

Die MINISTER VIR DIE STAATSDIENS EN ADMINISTRASIE: Mevrou die Speaker, mnr
die President, mnr die Adjunkpresident en lede van hierdie Huis, ons
verwelkom die President se alomvattende toespraak aan die Suid-Afrikaanse
nasie. Dit is een wat klem lê op aksie; aksie vir verandering, aksie vir
die konsolidering van 'n nie-rassistiese, nie-seksistiese Suid-Afrika. Dit
fokus ook op die noodsaaklikheid van aksie vir ontwikkeling op die
vasteland van Afrika.

Dit is egter ongelukkig so dat ons vandag weer eens deur toesprake van
verskeie lede van die opposisie - en nogal diegene wat as leiers beskou
word! - herinner word dat hulle geensins verstaan wat nie-rassisme in 'n
nasie beteken nie. Hulle het klaarblyklik nog steeds nie die
vryheidsmanifes van die ANC gelees en definitief nie bestudeer nie. Daarom
verstaan hulle nie wat dit beteken nie as ons sê Suid-Afrika behoort aan
almal, swart en wit. Hulle sal dus ook nie ten volle verstaan wat dit
beteken wanneer ons sê die mense regeer nie. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Madam Speaker, Mr
President, Mr Deputy President and members of this House, we welcome the
President's comprehensive speech to the South African nation. It is a
speech which emphasises action; action for change, action for the
consolidation of a non-racial, nonsexist South Africa. It also focuses on
the necessity for action for development on the African continent.

Unfortunately today we are once again being reminded by speeches of various
members of the opposition - and those who are regarded as leaders what is
more! - that they have no idea what nonracialism in a nation entails.
Obviously they have still not read the Freedom Charter of the ANC, and they
have definitely not studied it. That is why they do not know what it means
when we say that South Africa belongs to everyone, black and white. They
will therefore also not fully understand what it means when we say that the
people govern.]

The Public Service is a microcosm of the South African society. It embodies
all the potential and strengths of our society. But at the same time it
reveals all the weaknesses and challenges that are facing society in
general: The challenges of overcoming racial and gender divides in the
workplace; the difficulty of balancing the demands for a highly skilled,
technological, knowledgeable, adaptable and professional workforce and
managerial core versus the socioeconomic responsibility of the largest
employer in the country inheriting a public service that was not recruited
and maintained in a manner that supports the current demands; the demands
of keeping up with global and supranational governments which are rapidly
advancing in technological spheres versus our own constraints where in many
instances public servants at lower levels are hardly literate,  let alone e-
compliant.

These are but a few of the dynamics in the Public Service. In my
contribution to this debate today, I would like to look at improved service
delivery and transformational challenges for the Public Service. These are
obviously closely related. In fact they are two sides of a coin. We cannot
achieve the scale, extent and nature of service delivery that we seek to
achieve in our political and policy programmes without transforming the
Public Service. We will not be able to ensure responsiveness to the needs
of our nation if our Public Service does not mirror the same diversity.

We will not be able to spread the fruits of our policies to those who were
previously excluded by the state if we do not consciously find ways of
making our resources go further, working in new organisational forms where
our role is one of levering resources, setting up frameworks and becoming a
strong player in various service delivery networks.

We will not be able to provide services in an empowering way if we do not
manage to shift the mindset of officials from being self-important and all-
knowing to that of embracing the spirit and meaning of serving and working
in a developmental way, willing to learn and act, and reflecting on the
effect of the activities and processes followed on those who are supposed
to benefit from them.

In terms of improving service delivery, we adopted an approach that could
broadly be captured under the banner of developmental democracy. This is to
ensure that we have a developmental state and Government in place. We know
the situation was such that we could not just get away with improving
existing services and policies. We had to cut to the fundamental value base
of society at the time, and our first term of office was largely spent on
the task of getting our policies aligned to the value systems of an
equitable, nonracial democratic society and we still need to deepen this as
we are not quite there yet.

However, we have members such as Mr Leon who advocate a massive cut of the
Public Service. What does he mean by this? If he and Van Schalkwyk cannot
even get their speeches in synergy and avoid duplication, how on earth do
they imagine that they can conceptualise this thing he calls ``massive
cuts'' of the state? Absolute bloodletting! Much like that poster of theirs
which stated, ``Nail and jail them'' without contextualising it. I believe
this is a blatant disregard of the intelligence of the broad electorate. If
one lies to them and say it nicely, they might just believe it.

Further, our ideal is to put a nonracial and nonsexist society in place,
and the Public Service needs to make this happen. We have spread the net of
our services much wider than was previously done. We believe that we have
begun and gone some way up the road in putting the necessary building
blocks in place that will allow us to achieve notable successes in the
medium term and increasing more effective service delivery. I highlighted
some of these in the media briefing of the governance cluster yesterday, on
behalf of the cluster as a whole. I will merely talk about some of these.

We are aligning strategic planning and budgetary frameworks. A strategic
planning framework has been developed that takes due consideration of the
sequencing of different decision-making processes. In this way, the
political agenda will be the primary driver of Government programmes and
the Budget will become an instrument in executing policy rather than a
policy statement in its own right.

The multidepartmental and the interdisciplinary review process that we will
strengthen midyear when the medium-term expenditure committee sits, has
multiple purposes. It will assist in decision-making and prioritisation of
public expenditure.

It will simultaneously assist in identifying risks either through
programmes and projects beings pursued with insufficient resources
allocated to it or look at trends of previously over-stated activity and
subsequent underspending. In this regard the review process can create
opportunities for departments through peer review processes to assist in a
constructive way by putting in place the necessary capability that can
support implementation at key moments. A process like this had the added
spin-off of serving as an incentive to departments to increase performance
since their relative performance will be exposed to their peers.

Integrated planning and budgeting further allows us to make significant
strides into making programmes the key vehicles for delivering our policies
rather than hoping that various projects that line departments may conceive
in isolation, will in the end all add up and allow us to deliver against
our goals and objectives.

The people we serve are not interested in dealing with the structural
dysjunction in the various agencies of Public Service delivery. To them
Government is a largely monolithic institution and hence we need to ensure
that we facilitate service delivery in line with those justified
expectations.

A better, integrated strategic planning and budgeting framework also
permits us to prioritise easier and more clearly and make some clean and
hard decisions regarding the allocation of skills resources, and we have
seen the effect of these in the President's speech when the President
outlined a clear sequencing of the role out of the integrated rural
development strategy and the urban renewal strategy. These frameworks and
the support processes and legislation that underpins it will also, in view
of the agreements that were made at the recent jobs summit, contribute to
our human resources public service  being more easily redeployed where it
is necessary.

It is very easy to get overwhelmed by the immense need that faces so many
of our people on a day to day basis. However, we have learnt that to spread
ourselves too thinly results in bewilderment in the administration, loss of
focus and commensurate inability to get on with the job. So tighter
focusing of our efforts, with a very clear targeting of programmes on those
who are most in need whilst maintaining on-going activity, we believe, is
the recipe for successful implementation.

The transformational challenges of the Public Service go deeper than only
changing the face of the institution. However, achieving a different
composition is a necessary prior step to many more far-reaching
transformation processes to kick in. As we have said so many times before,
the critical issue is to achieve a skills and competency profile that
supports the developmental tasks that the Public Service we are striving
for should deliver upon. Only if it has that kind of profile can it
underpin the developmental state appropriately. It is not about a knee-jerk
massive cut that is uninformed.

The targets that have been set in the White Paper on the transformation of
the Public Service have been that after five years 50% of managers will be
black and 30% of appointments should be filled by women. These targets
pertained to the managerial level.

Comrade President correctly reminded us that we have not managed to meet
the targets in terms of gender representation. I would like to dwell on
this very briefly. When we took office in 1994 only 4% of women in the
Public Service were found on levels which we currently capture as senior
management - that is to say, directors and above. Of the 4% in the then
Public Service the most senior were 10 chief directors.

No women were appointed either as directors-general or as deputy directors-
general. The bulk of the 4%, which is 75 to be exact, were at director
level. We need to take on the challenge to take this further, as we have
committed ourselves to doing, and we will do so under the leadership of
Comrade President.

Now, this brings me to the topic that causes much discomfort to some
people, as we have heard in this House earlier today. That is the issue of
ensuring that we build a nonracial society. Clearly, the Public Service
should be nonracial, because we know that if we do not fully transform the
Public Service, the centre of what was institutionalised racism, we will
not achieve what is required by the developmental state. It is not simply
about bringing people together in the workplace. It is not simply about
changing the faces. It is about introducing a new culture.

There is still much to be said, but I would like to conclude by saying that
it is under the leadership of this President that, as the ANC, we improved
on our majority in the general election of 1994. It is, secondly, under the
leadership of this President that the ANC further deepened the commitment
it made in the Freedom Charter - the commitment to delivering service to
all South Africans. It is under the leadership of this President that the
Public Service, trade unions and governments came together and
acknowledged, for the first time in the history of our country, ``... that
they share a common commitment to a broader interest of serving the South
African nation.''

The President's name, Mvuyelwa, captures what we experience under his
leadership. The South African nation is truly happy to have him at its
helm. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy President, Ministers
and hon members, when we refer to our history and our past as a painful
past, it is indeed true. But we must do so without allowing any bitterness
to permeate our lives, because bitterness cannot effect true
transformation. Yes, when we are reminded of our sad history, we must
acknowledge the mistakes of the past; we must take from the past  what is
good, and when we refer to mistakes made by our previous governments, we
must do so not merely to condemn, but mainly to learn how not to repeat
those mistakes. We must not develop the tendency or spend too much time
continuously highlighting our obvious legacy, but we must, as a nation,
spend most of our energies on building a better South Africa for all our
people.

The President is correct when he says that we should not be -


  ... discouraged or overwhelmed by the litany of negative messages about
  our country ...

As patriotic citizens of our country, we should not paint a picture of doom
and gloom of the transformation process that is taking place in our nation.
We should be realistic without being negative. We should be critical
without being destructive.

We in the ACDP are committed to the constructive process of building a
better South African society and, of course, we bring to this process a
unique dimension. Like the present Government, we also believe that it is
imperative that we improve the quality of life of all our people, but
especially that of the poorest of the poor, the widows, the orphans and the
outcasts of society. We, however, believe that true transformation begins
with the renewal of our minds, which then leads to acts of transformation.

We also believe that transformation begins at home. The qualities that we
want to see in a new and better South Africa must be promoted by us in our
homes. If we want justice, fairness, respect for our elders and parents,
and if we want peace and harmony in our nation, we must begin by
implementing this in our own families, because the family is the microcosm
of the broader South African society.

If we have a breakdown of law and order in our families, if children defy
the authority of their parents and elders, if we utter racist and
xenophobic remarks at the supper table and if we continually denigrate
others at home, then we must not be surprised if our society broadly
reflects the same values. If we truly desire transformation, let us begin
at home.

Transformation is not the duty of Government only but it should be a
process which permeates our whole society. It is for this reason that we,
in the ACDP, have emphasised the central role played by family structures.
We get this from biblical law and that is why we do not want Government to
pass any law that undermines the authority of the family.

Four of the 10 commandments deal directly with the family. These laws
command us, firstly, to honour our parents. Secondly, they command us not
to commit adultery. Thirdly, they command us not to steal and lastly, not
to covet anything that belongs to our neighbours. These are not the laws of
Moses which he wrote by himself but they are laws which come directly from
God to bless not only the nation of Israel but every nation which obeys
God.

I would like to say to the President that if our nation decides today to
start obeying these four basic commandments, we will see a remarkable
improvement in our society. The family which consists of mother, father and
children is not a primitive institution, but God's plan for humanity.

Regarding the issue of local government elections and the establishment of
new municipal councils, we wish to congratulate all those councillors who
have been elected to office. We are mindful that the challenges to new
councillors will be enormous. Not only will the structures be new, but
programmes to improve the quality of life of all our citizens will also be
challenging. We are also aware of the fact that due to the lack of
resources, many of these programmes remain on the blackboard. Perhaps the
time has come for this Government to review the equitable share of the
national budget to local government.

On the issue of the fight against poverty and underdevelopment, it is our
view that we cannot measure progress alone by counting the amount of houses
built or under construction, and the amount of homes receiving electricity
and clean water. Of course, these things are all good and they help in the
fight against poverty. But they do not transform a family from a family of
poverty to one which can sustain itself. Thus the answer lies not just in
the provision of these goods and services, but in developing a culture of
self-sustainability. Perhaps this is where we as a nation and not just
Government should put all our efforts. Let the people be empowered with the
skills to build their own homes and create their own employment when they
cannot find jobs.

Crime must be exposed and rooted out where it is prevalent in the areas
where they stay. We welcome the importance that the President has placed on
economic growth and job creation. The President struck a positive role when
he emphasised -
  ... Government's resolve to rein in Government spending as part of a
  broader strategy ... conducive to enhanced economic growth ...

Two weeks before the opening of Parliament we attended workshops on
macroeconomic policy and performance budgeting. We want to encourage
Government to change its method of reporting on the Budget and concentrate
on outcomes and performance. We therefore commend Government on signing
performance contracts with directors-general of various departments.

In conclusion, I would like to say to the President that his opening speech
struck a positive note with national and international business. There are,
however, certain critical issues to which my colleague, Adv Madasa, will
respond when he takes this podium. [Applause.]

Mr K M N GIGABA: Somlomo, siyabonga kuMzizi ngomhlahlandlela asiphe wona
kuleli sonto elidlule. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Mzizi for
the guidelines that he has given us.]

The youth of our country are the happier for all the programmes we
announced to ensure their participation in the development of this country.
Indeed, the President was correct to argue that gradually, step by step,
our country proceeds further away from its painful past. For that journey
to succeed, our people are dared to act as masters of their own destiny, to
act in unity and unite in action for change.

Having taken it upon themselves to dismantle apartheid, our people must
commit further sacrifices to build the future that they want. In this
effort, our youth must act like a generation at work to build a better
life. So, because youth interests are inseparable from those of their
people as a whole, we must always act in a manner consistent with this
understanding of what our people see as their interests.

Accordingly, we must know that our patience for arts, culture, sports,
recreation, education and jobs is all intricately linked with the
achievement of the goal of a better life. Conscious of this, I am hopeful
that our youth will rise to the call and act for their own development, as
well as that of our nation as a whole.
Some of the problems observed from our youth are derived from the
continuing challenge of youth underdevelopment as well as the achievement
of the democratic victory which has fostered an attitude of mind among some
that they must sit and wait impatiently for their needs and aspirations to
be addressed by Government and society, without any contribution on their
part.

Again, we must reiterate the statement that youth interests are inseparable
from those of their people as a whole. At the same time, it is urgent that
this country should develop a deeper understanding of youth as a sector.
Often, in our society, we apply shallow and conservative methods to
understand the youth and, hence, fail dismally to make sense of them and
mobilise them.

Nonetheless, we still have a challenge to mobilise the youth to be active
in the transformation process. Such a challenge calls for the active
participation of all to instil in our youth a greater sense of social
discipline, social responsibility, national service and civic duties.
Therefore, we must not delay in introducing the national youth service
programme, to mobilise and engage youth in literacy, adult basic education
and training, Aids and other campaigns.

Further, there must be no delays in introducing civic education as part of
the mandatory school curriculum. Ways must be found to strengthen and
provide capacity to youth organisations, to enable them to fulfil their
task of inculcating the youth with the culture of national service and
civic consciousness. The youth must come to know that it took inordinate
sacrifice to liberate this country from the evil of apartheid.

Of course, so too must they know that any action on their part, contrary to
what we have outlined above, will result in the prostitution of the heroic
legacy of our liberation struggle by some that wish to demean it and its
icons.

Of course, Marx was correct in saying:


  ... whilst in everyday life, every shopkeeper is well able to distinguish
  between what somebody professes to be and what he really is.

Our historians have not yet won this trivial insight. They take every
windbag at its word and believe that everything it says or imagines about
itself is true. Sadly, to this day, we still have not mastered this trivial
insight with regard to political parties and persons. Thus we are rendered
gullible to all manner of manipulation.

In the theatre of social action it is no fiction that each party or person
has particular concrete material interest that they represent through their
policies and programmes. Accordingly, we have an obligation to look beyond
what they say or imagine about themselves.

To be a party for all the people, any organisation must - and in the
context of South Africa - be a party for nonracialism, nonsexism, unity,
democracy and a better life for all. And it will not be such a party simply
because it itself says so, but because its policies, principles and
programmes are so and the South African people see it as such.

The fact is that our people do not think that the DA is racist simply in
spite, or because it calls itself so. They do so in spite of it disclaiming
to be racist. Of course, its leadership derives its careers, titles and
politics from the persistence of racism. At its inception, it defined its
political niche as defending white interests.

Accordingly, it is a party deeply steeped in the defence and resuscitation
of the past. Necessarily, and having thus defined its political niche, it
must act in the principled, opportunistic, divisive and offensive manner
that has become so characteristic of this new hybrid. It is this sheer and
brazen opportunism that has no regard for decency that led the hon Mr
Martinus Van Schalkwyk to visit the sites he visited, obviously, out of
opportunism dressed up as reconciliation.

Ngokwesiko lama-Afrika, amaliba abakithi abangasekho ayindawo
ehloniphekileyo engasetshenziselwa nje inzuzo yeze yezombusazwe. Akufanele
ukuthi amaliba amadlozi esizwe enziwe umdlalo.

Isenzo sikamhlonishwa, uMnu Van Schalkwyk, sibonisa ngokusobala ukuthi leli
qembu lakhe alikawahloniphi futhi liwenza inhlekisa ama-Afrika kanye
namasiko awo. Ngithi kuMnu Van Schalkwyk, ngokwesiko, umuntu akavele nje
antaze aye emalibeni abalele engazange agunyazwe ngabomndeni, azithobe
phambi kwabo futhi bakhipha abazomphelezela.

Lesi senzo siyichilo elibi futhi eliyinhlamba kulezi zigagayi zomzabalazo
wenkululeko iqembu lakhe elazibulala, lazilahla isitimela sihamba, lazimuka
izikhundla zazo futhi lazidingisa. Kepha nakalokhu, alikaze licele uxolo
nentethelelo kubo bonke abamnyama. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs
follows.)

[According to African tradition, graves are sacred places which cannot be
used for mere political gain. The graves of the nation's spirit should
never be toyed with.

Mr Van Schalkwyk's behaviour shows clearly that his party has no respect;
instead it jokes about the Africans and their customs. I would like to tell
Mr Van Schalkwyk that according to African tradition, a person cannot just
roam around the graveyards without first asking and this then being
sanctioned by the family of the deceased, which will send somebody to
accompany him to the graveyards.

His action is a great humiliation and insult to the freedom fighters who
were killed by his party, as it threw them on the railways, demoted them
from their hereditary positions and then exiled them. In spite of this, his
party has never asked for forgiveness from all black people.]

This gimmick continues to invite rage from the victims of the policies
pursued by the NP and the DP, for which there has been no apology. Of
course, it is correct and necessary that the white community should
acknowledge the past and identify with these icons of the struggle against
apartheid as their own icons. For such freedom icons as these lived, fought
and died so that the gift of freedom could be conferred on all - oppressor
and oppressed. And such such, they deserve our collective national homage.

The hon Mr Van Schalkwyk's visit to the graves of these icons becomes vain,
opportunistic, hypocritical and, hence, an insult to those who struggled
for freedom and democracy in the conspicuous absence of an apology from
either the New NP, DP or DA for the crimes of apartheid for which all these
organisations are co-responsible. [Interjections.] To this day, they did
nothing to mobilise material resources for reconstruction and development,
given the cold truth that the colonial and apartheid policies resulted in
grave outcomes for this country and continent.
White supremacy, necessarily, was achieved at an unbearable cost to the
black majority. The future South Africa is being erected precisely upon
this correct understanding of the gross racial and social disparities borne
by the colonial and apartheid past. And this is a programme for all the
people.

On the contrary, as a bulwark for white privilege and capitalist class
interests, by definition the DA represents the overwhelming minority. To be
a party for all the people, it must first shed its very core principles
and, accordingly, the principal reason for its own existence.

To the hon Mr Leon, even a leader of a racial minority has at least some
decency in him, which he obviously lacks. [Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Mme Mmusakgotla, Motlotlegi Mopresidente, Motlatsa-Tautona
le batlotlegi mo Ntlong eno ... [Madam Speaker, hon President, Deputy
President and hon members of this House ...]

... the nation eagerly awaited the President's address. Everyone was all
ears, so to say, and the anxiety and expectations ran high. The address has
been received in a variety of ways. In a democracy this is not unexpected.
People are entitled to their own views and interpretations. Of course
fanatic zealots are intolerant of different views, except of the views of
their party.

We, the DP and our alliance partners, listened very attentively and
carefully to the President's delivery. We did not rant and rave in the
uncouth manner in which some of the ANC members are in the habit of doing,
thus tarnishing the dignity of rational debate, as well as the dignity and
image of this august body, Parliament.

We give the President his due credit for taking heed of different voices
that prevail in this House and in our society in general. Indeed, humility
rather than a haughty hubris is a mark of good leadership.

We shall be pointing out these issues and aspects that we see as not
watertight or good enough. We shall praise and admonish with vigour and
honesty when such a need arises. We are the legitimate voice of the voters
too. We owe nobody any apology for being the opposition, so as to provide
that essential element of a true and working democracy. Let me remind all
of us, and the country at large, that the DA has arrived and is destined to
be the alternative government driven by its liberal democratic core values
and principles. [Interjections.]

We, together with the President, are willing to fight and expose
corruption, nepotism, crime, poverty, woman and child abuse and the scourge
of HIV/Aids. Unemployment is a nightmare that needs to be eradicated. Our
stance shall be genuinely critical from the very onset, because we intend
separating the chaff of rhetoric from the grains of transformational
reality.

Uncritical collaboration and total unconcern are ``no-nos'' for us. We are
going to speak out and create public opinion if needs be, despite the
bellicose diatribe of our detractors and the ``Goebbels-orientated'' spin
doctors on the other side.

To the hon the President and the House at large I wish to say that I am
certain that they have not forgotten the wisdom of Paulo Freire when he
asserts that -


  ... human existence cannot be silent, nor can it be nourished by false
  words or hollow promises but only by true words with which men and women
  transform the world. To exist humanly is to name the world; to change it
  because saying true words is not the privilege of some men and women, but
  the right of every person - including that of the opposition.

Scribes and commentators say that the President's address was ``a mild
mixed bag of messages kindling hope''. That may be so; but it should be
like that, especially after the wells of human or race relations have been
poisoned by senseless short-sighted party zealots and fanatics perpetuating
neo-racist stereotypes and hatred towards anybody who is not black or
belongs to the ANC.

We condemn racism in all its forms and manifestations. We cannot combat
racism selectively from one side of the spectrum. Racism is a human malady
or cancer that knows no colour. Bigots come in all colours, shapes and
sizes. Racism is the twin brother or sister of ethnicity or tribalism. Let
us not also shy away from xenophobia, which is the cousin of these two
kinds of vermin.

Unity in action can only be realised if the pillars of justice, fair play
and reconciliation, in their undiluted forms, are in place and are lived up
to and practised to the letter, not merely as a form of expedient
mobilisation, a rhetorical tool or a slogan. Issues of diversity,
nonracialism, and freedom of belief and expression and association do not
cease to be real issues of life and death simply because uhuru has dawned.
Sustainable and consistent conscious effort needs to be made by all in our
society, including bigheaded loud vessels. ``Unity in action'', ``a better
life for all'', ``equity and opportunity'' should be the slogans of our
nation and country.

We all have a special role to play if we are open to it. That special
purpose, albeit a burden, is almost divine and can therefore never be taken
away from one, given the sense of divine mission. The ruling party should
therefore begin to be tolerant of other parties' democratic right of
participation in debates and their concrete contribution intended to shape
the character and soul of our country. ``If this is not the rubric of
national discipline,'' Francisco Claver would say, ``then I believe there
is nothing to hope for from our people''.
Much of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's tasks remain unfinished
business, especially reparation to the victims of gross human rights
violations. The skeletons of inadequate disclosure or nondisclosure are
still in the airtight cupboards of the ANC. [Interjections.] This militates
against profound forgiveness and reconciliation despite ``izindlobongela''
[hooligans or thugs] who are making noise.

Let us desist from playing the race card and the short-sighted political
pyrrhic victories. I want to say to the hon the President that he should
unite this nation, and not divide it, that he should heal the nation and
not poison race and human relations. All citizens, irrespective of their
culture, race, colour, gender, belief and political affiliation, or lack of
same, are citizens of this country, deserving to be treated as such.
[Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The hon
Minister of Justice, during the speech which was just being made ...
[Interjections] ... saw fit to imitate Mr Dumisane Makhaye, whose actions
in the KwaZulu-Natal legislature were mentioned here today, by holding his
nose and waving like that. [Interjections.] [Laughter.]
Some people think it is amusing, other people think it has a very
unfortunate racist connotation. [Interjections.] I ask you to make a ruling
that it is unparliamentary and that you should order the hon Minister of
Justice to behave himself. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Gibson, by no stretch of the imagination can I say
that when a person holds or touches his or her nose it is unparliamentary.
[Interjections.] I mean, I did not see that ... [Interjections] ... and the
House is full of members of all races. It can therefore not be said that
this was directed at any particular group. [Interjections.]

Ms S C VOS: Madam Speaker, hon colleagues ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Yes, hon Doidge?

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Madam Speaker, my apologies to Ms Vos, who was taking the
podium.

I am not sure what this word ``izindlobongela'' means. Is it parliamentary?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: ``Izindlobongela'' are not animals. What is
unparliamentary is to refer to any member as an animal. ``Izindlobongela''
are not animals.

An HON MEMBER: Hooligans.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: It means hooligans, yes, or thugs. [Interjections.]

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Madam Speaker, the previous speaker at the podium did use
that term.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Doidge, I do not believe that we can really say
that ``izindlobongela'' is necessarily unparliamentary. I do not think so.
I will therefore make the ruling that we should leave ``izindlobongela''
alone.

Ms S C VOS: Madam Speaker, hon colleagues, Mr President, the IFP listened
very closely to the citizens of this country during the recent local
government elections. We listened very closely to the President's message
too, and now, more than ever, we are determined that the IFP is going to
continue to be a party to providing constructive solutions to our nation's
needs.
We know we have a vital contribution to make, and we intend to attempt a
multifaceted approach to the development of our land and its people. The
IFP and the ANC alliance share a constituency which embraces the majority
of South Africans, and together we seek to serve men, women and children
who, irrespective of race, creed or colour, desperately need us to help
them help themselves.

There are policies, programmes and priorities about which our parties
differ. Together in government, and here in the opposition benches, we will
work to effect creative compromise. The IFP believes it has its own unique
contribution to make in building a new and better South Africa, and we
intend, while working with you, to achieve our common goals, and to
redouble our efforts to prove that the IFP message is indeed the right
message. [Interjections.]

Listening to you, evaluating what Government has been able to achieve since
1994 and recognising the areas in which it has failed, we are more than
ever convinced that responsible and effective Government delivery can only
be achieved if our citizens recognise that self-help and self-reliance are
the keys to their social, economic and spiritual salvation. Our many
hundreds of elected IFP officials, representing national, provincial and
local governments, have been ordered to effect responsible, honest
government in their promotion of development, more development and more
development, and to reflect in all that they do the priorities of citizens
in the circumstances in which they find themselves.

They are required to reach out and to work with our traditional, religious,
business and community leaders in all spheres of social and economic
upliftment. But specifically, we are asking that they stress that we do not
just want more houses, more roads, more clinics and more hospitals, and so
on. We want more houses for families who love and protect each other, and
for parents who appropriately nurture their children. We want homes, not
just houses, for people who value the wisdom of their elders and genuinely
care for the aged and the infirm. We want roads to effect development, but
we want roads for the use of people who obey the law and drive safely. We
want hospitals where staff do not steal and care-givers do not abuse their
patients. We want to see communities working together in hope and taking
pride in their societies, and we want them to have the integrity and the
courage to be able to co-operate with our criminal justice system to
eradicate from their midst all those who sow misery and destruction, and
impede human and socioeconomic development.

We are insisting that a message is spread that all spheres of government
have responsibilities and obligations, but so, too, do citizens. If we do
not work as equal partners with our communities, the future of this country
will be placed on a perilous path, and we all know it. If we do not spread
the word that there will be effective and severe consequences for all who
are dishonest and who stand in the way of the upliftment of their fellow
South Africans, we stand no chance of succeeding in our noble quest.

We want to see delivery and more delivery, but we do not believe it will be
possible without individuals and communities also trying to make very real
efforts to improve themselves and their circumstances in a variety of ways.
[Interjections.] It is for this reason that the IFP is calling for a
serious debate on values in our nation. If we are not a nation imbued with
moral values, how do we really believe we can achieve anything?

The rot of entitlement, spawned by the deprivations of apartheid, will
curse our country for generations to come if we do not inculcate in hearts
and minds that only hard work brings rewards, that the real value in any
society is that of its citizens who reflect, in their daily lives, honesty,
compassion, integrity and diligence in all that they do.

Apartheid was an evil which produced an evil. It bequeathed us a sick,
traumatised, poverty-stricken society which, in itself, is manifesting
other kinds of evil: murder, robbery, gratuitous violence, the rape of
women and children, rampant domestic violence, abandoned children, growing
evidence of sexual deviation amongst our youth, children who produce
children and parents who neglect the obligations and responsibilities of
parenthood.

This trauma has produced dysfunctional homes and communities and all of the
President's and our grand plans will come to nought, unless we not only
offer and effect appropriate socioeconomic delivery, but also equally
demand that individuals and communities look to themselves and their own
behaviour. Here, too, we must effect delivery and recognise the need for
help in the healing process. There must as well be swift action and
stigmatising and stamping out antisocial behaviour.

Last week the front page of the Sowetan showed a picture of a woman lying
abandoned, all alone on a street, dying of Aids. Nosipho Xhape, 29 years,
of Doornkop informal settlement, died only hours after that picture was
taken. She had been thrown out of her home by her partner when he learned
the reality of her illness. She was told that she was useless as she could
no longer cook and clean. As I said, she died only hours later, the day
before the President's address, and her last words were of her love for her
children.

That this can happen to one woman is shocking enough in our society.
Welfare officials will tell hon members that it is happening across the
length and breadth of our land. Millions live in fear of the ruthless
behaviour of their fellow South Africans throughout our land, and we know
that poverty and unequal power relations are primarily to blame.

Elderly black women are tragically the most physically and economically
abused persons in South Africa. Their pensions feed the unemployed, their
homes nurture the homeless, their goodness reaches out in caring for their
children struck down by HIV/Aids, and they care for the orphans that are
left behind. But the fact remains that they, too, are brutalised in their
homes, and nobody is listening to the last victims of apartheid. What are
we doing to help the last victims of apartheid?

The fact remains, we cannot build this new society that we want to build if
brutality in all its forms undermines all that we attempt to do. Let us
help each other to change this. [Applause.]

Mrs J CHALMERS: Madam Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy President and
members of the House, I should like to begin by congratulating the
President on his state of the nation address. It was a speech well received
by South Africans and the outside world. For me what was particularly
important and encouraging was the focus the President put on microeconomic
issues, for those are the issues that impact directly on the poor. These
are development issues, issues that can make a difference in the creation
of jobs, particularly in the rural areas.

The President made the point that we the people of this land share a common
legacy of a painful past. He also emphasised that this was a legacy that we
did not desire and that we are therefore committed to moving away from it.
Poverty is an unwanted lodger in 60% of all South African households, and
our country is battling to emerge from a scenario of huge differences
between the haves and the have-nots. Seventy per cent of the poor, ie those
living below a minimum living level, stay in the rural areas, and even now
poverty remains closely related to race. ``Why?'' I ask, for ours is a land
blessed with rich natural resources.

Suffice it to say that for many long years our people were deprived of
their birthright, their land and their voice, and the ugly spectre of
poverty became their lifelong companion on their journey of life. The ANC
understands what this means, for a great many of my colleagues on this side
of the House have first-hand experience of what deep poverty means,
something those on the immediate left can hardly lay claim to.
[Interjections.] The ANC understands what poverty is all about and can
identify with the desperate need people have to climb out of the poverty
trap.
Yet, ours is a rich land with an extraordinary wealth of natural resources,
above and below the ground. We have many rich and varied cultures, we have
technical and business expertise that is respected worldwide. We have
schools, technikons and universities, we are producing a wealth of
agricultural products, yet 60% of our people are living below the poverty
line. Turning this around is going to take a commitment from every citizen
of this land - the wealthy, the middle income groups and the poor alike.

Many of us have been touched and damaged by the problems that confront us,
but each of us also knows something of the creativity, the courage, the
caring and the energy that manifests itself in all sorts of ways as we move
around the country and we are hugely encouraged by the delivery that is
happening. We are encouraged too by what is happening in our schools for it
was in the classrooms that past education systems condemned our children to
remain locked into a state of serfdom and poverty, and it is there that
they are beginning to shake off the shackles.

Mine is a rural constituency where, in terms of the new local government
dispensation, three small towns have been amalgamated into one council.
There is high unemployment there - 90% in one of the towns. Each town has
special attributes - one a main railway line, another is historic and
picturesque with good water and a third is surrounded by game farms. They
have stable communities, little crime, schools, good roads, many homes now
have electricity, water and sanitation. In fact, they are a lot better off
than many South Africans. There is great potential for tourism,
agriculture, crafting or producing goods for local markets. As one young
comrade said to me: We are a mine waiting to be mined. But the cry goes
out: There are no jobs, we appreciate the new services but we cannot pay
for them.

I have spent long hours discussing with my comrades: ``What can make it
happen?'', and I would like to recount something of what I have been
hearing! Firstly, there is a lack of channelling of resources to the rural
areas - and I do not just mean money. The practice of funding projects in
remote rural areas and then leaving people to fend for themselves has been
extremely destructive, especially to people's confidence and hopes. Serious
thought should be given to enabling communities through appropriate
interventions and sustained backup from dedicated advisors to tender for
local projects and development instead of allowing such job-creating
intiatives to go to outside consultants and contractors. This happens too
often with the result that I hear them saying: money is moving out of our
area and is being disinvested.

Secondly, we have to acknowledge that in many areas the incoming
councillors are taking over bankrupt municipalities. The desire has been
expressed to me for an audit - certainly of the more needy municipalities -
to ascertain their financial strengths and administrative capacity with a
view to helping them start on a sound footing. Communities across the board
are a rich source of knowledge about poverty and methods to combat it, and
it follows that technologies and methods to combat it should be matched to
the strengths and needs of local communities.

Thirdly, of major concern, is the fact that banks, clothing chain stores
and now the post offices - certainly in their present form - are leaving
the small towns. The reason given is that there is insufficient money
circulating to keep them there. Cosatu's proposal of a bank citizens' grant
is still very much in its infancy, but interesting. It could provide a more
substantial safety net for the poor and inject a regular amount of money
into society. It is worth our consideration.
Fourthly, is the concern that there seems to be an ongoing inability at
provincial level to ensure that resources are well-managed and
appropriately used. There is a substantial gap between decisions taken and
delivery and a worrying lack of co-ordination between need and capacity.
And the communities bear the brunt of this dysfunctionality.

Lastly, I would make a plea for a number of causes. Tourism is a huge job
creator, yet there is virtually no funding for the ``off the track'' small
towns, however attractive they may be, to promote those attractions.
Creative ways must be found to assist the new municipalities sell their
towns, possibly the Department of Education and Training could come up with
guidelines to make this happen.

There are deep concerns in the rural areas about the escalation of the
money-lending scenario. It is becoming nightmarish, seriously inflationary
and now a real factor in the lives of the poor. It is clear that people
need money, but other options should be made available to them, building on
community strengths. Those options do exist. I would hope the rural
development programmes make them a priority focus. There is also a critical
need for a regrowth of road and rail public transport if we are to come
back from isolation and provide support for and access to markets for our
rural communities.

Finally, when civil society attempts to assist a community, whether they be
churches, farmers, housewives or whoever, let us aid, empower, that group
and not obstruct it with red tape and bureaucracy. NGOs too are an
essential part of the fight for empowerment in management skills and, most
importantly, for ways to conquer the HIV/Aids epidemic. Public and private
partnerships are a necessary aspect of the battle. To quote our President:


  We march into the new era of the African Century as Africans who have
  made the determination that this century will be a hundred years in which
  we cease to be victims of our circumstances, but become victors.

Our President has made that commitment and it is now up to all of us to
follow his lead. [Applause.]

Mr J J DOWRY: Madam Speaker, Mr President and Deputy President, before I
start with my speech, I would like to react to Mr Gigaba, who made a
vicious and racist attack on Mr Van Schalkwyk, using the IsiZulu language,
knowing that it would not be understood by Mr Van Schalkwyk. It is a
trademark of somebody who does not have backbone. So, I would like to tell
him that his facts are totally wrong. Mr Van Schalkwyk went to the families
of the icons, of those people, before visiting the graves. He had the
blessing of Mrs Goniwe and she actually allowed him to go to the grave and
do what he wanted to do. He did the same with Chief Luthuli's grave. So, it
is totally wrong to attack him without having the necessary facts.

Die agb President se openingsrede van Vrydag het in 'n aantal opsigte hoop
gebring. Daar was egter ook heelwat leemtes ten opsigte van kritieke
vraagstukke wat ons in die gesig staar.

In dié toespraak het die President nie sy kras ontleding van Suid-Afrika as
'n land van twee nasies herhaal nie. Die onderliggende toon van sy
toespraak was baie meer versoenend as verlede jaar s'n. Ons sal egter nou
graag wil sien dat hierdie versoenende toon verder gevoer word, en ons sal
oor 'n jaar wil terugkyk en sê daar is werklike inhoud gegee aan versoening
en nasiebou in hierdie land.

Hier moet 'n mens ook dadelik iets byvoeg oor nasiebou. Een van die dinge
wat mnr Gigaba ook hier gesê het, is dat daar voortdurend verskoning gevra
moet word. Om 'n nasie te bou moet 'n mens ook in jou binneste die vermoë
vind om te kan vergewe. 'n Mens moet kan vergewe. Daar moenie net
aanhoudend om verskoning gevra word nie. 'n Mens moet darem ook in 'n
stadium probeer om te vergewe. Mahatma Gandhi het eenmaal gesê: ``The weak
can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.'' Ek wil aan
die hand doen dat agb lede hier ook moet probeer vergewe sodat hulle ook as
sterk mense gesien kan word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The hon the President's opening address on Friday brought hope in a number
of ways. However, there were also quite a number of shortcomings with
regard to critical issues facing us.

In this speech the President did not repeat his extreme analysis of South
Africa as a country of two nations. The underlying tone of his speech was
far more reconciliatory than last year's. However, we would now like to see
this reconciliatory tone taken further, and a year hence we would like to
look back and say that real content was given to reconciliation and nation-
building in this country.

Here one must immediately add something about nation-building. One of the
things which Mr Gigaba also said here is that apologies must constantly be
tendered. In order to build a nation, one must also find the ability within
oneself to forgive. One must be able to forgive. One must not constantly
ask for forgiveness. Surely at some stage one must also try to forgive.
Mahatma Gandhi once said: ``The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the
attribute of the strong.'' I want to suggest that hon members should also
try to forgive so that they can be seen as strong people.]

There are a number of major omissions from the President's address. South
Africa faces huge problems with the rapid spread of the killer disease
HIV/Aids, fighting the scourge of poverty and the unacceptable levels of
crime. The South African Government also suffers a credibility problem
because of its kidglove approach to corruption. We expected the President
to give leadership and also to deal with burning issues like the
``armsgate'' scandal. However, he only mentioned some of these issues in
passing, as if they were run-of-the-mill issues.

I want to refer specifically to the issue of job creation. It is a while
ago that the ANC-led Government announced its intention to selectively
review labour legislation. Despite this commitment, little has been done
and one of the major obstacles to job creation remains intact. With an
unemployment rate of more than 36%, it is a priority to review labour
legislation and to remove those aspects that create an unnecessarily rigid
labour market.

If we want to deliver human dignity to our people and fight poverty, we
must create jobs through economic growth. Not only must we remove the
obstacles to job creation, but we must also create an environment that is
attractive to foreign direct investment in general. We cannot expect a
foreign investor to invest in South Africa if he has to fear for his own
life or that of his family. Other major areas of job creation that we have
to focus on are creating a spirit of enterprise, encouraging SMME
development and developing the tourism sector.

Die Wes-Kaap, wat in verskeie opsigte reeds die toon aangee met goeie
regering, is nie verniet die provinsie met die laagste werkloosheid,
laagste vlakke van korrupsie en buitengewoon hoë ekonomiese groei nie. Dit
is omdat ons in hierdie provinsie weet hoe om te regeer en hoe om 'n
omgewing te skep wat vir buitelandse toeriste en beleggers aantreklik sal
wees.

Wat ons in die Wes-Kaap doen, doen ons baie beslis nie net om die een
Golden Arrow-toekenning na die ander in te palm nie, maar omdat ons werklik
omgee vir al die mense. Suid-Afrikaners verdien meer as om in voortdurende
armoede of in vrees vir hulle lewe voort te leef of om van hulle
menswaardigheid gestroop te word omdat hulle nie werk het en kos op hulle
tafel kan sit nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The Western Cape, which in various respects already leads the way with
regard to good governance, is not the province with the lowest rate of
unemployment, lowest levels of corruption and exceptionally high economic
growth for nothing. It is because we in this province know how to govern
and how to create an environment which will be attractive to foreign
tourists and investors.
What we are doing in the Western Cape we are certainly not doing  merely to
snap up one Golden Arrow Award after another, but because we truly care
about all the people. South Africans deserve more than to live in
continuing poverty or in fear of their lives or to be stripped of their
human dignity because they do not have work and cannot put food on their
table.]

In the telecommunications field we welcome the hon the President's
announcement of the establishment of two bodies to assist the Government,
to avoid falling far behind the rest of the world in this sector. We hope
that a third cellular licence will also be announced as soon as possible,
as this will be in the interest of the consumer, the economy, and will also
enhance job creation in our country.

Die aanwending van moderne kommunikasie- en inligtings-tegnologie is 'n
moet vir skole en veral vir die handel, en daarom verwelkom ons die
President se belofte dat die Regering spoedig aandag aan dié sektor sal
gee. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The implementation of modern communication and information technology is a
must for schools and for commerce in particular, and we therefore welcome
the President's promise that the Government will soon give attention to
this sector. [Applause.]]

Ms N E HANGANA: Madam Speaker, Comrade President of the people and members
of Parliament, ...

... ndingathanda ukuthi kuMongameli, abagxeki, abanyelisi nezibhoxi
bangamthuka, bamnukuneze, bamthini, kodwa, bona abantu abayaziyo inyaniso
bayamlandela. Makabakhokele ke ngoko uMongameli kuba bamthembile. [I would
like to say to the hon the  President that those whose intentions are
simply to criticise and deride development processes, can hurl as many
insults as they like at him, but those who know the truth will always stand
by him. The hon the President must lead them, for they have confidence in
him.]

Ride on, Comrade President, the nation is fully behind you. [Applause.]

The people have reaffirmed their confidence in the ANC. The ANC's
resounding victory in the last local government elections confirms the
confidence the South African people have in the ANC. The ANC was the only
organisation which contested all 237 municipalities and it won an outright
majority in 162 municipalities. [interjections.] The ANC's overall share of
the vote increased slightly from the previous local elections from 38,8 to
59,4%. [Applause.] It has increased, inyukile [It has gone up].

An HON MEMBER: They do not understand.

Ms N E HANGANA: They are too stupid to understand.

The majority has clearly demonstrated the confidence they have in the ANC
in continuing to lead the struggle for a better life. This in turn places
the responsibility on the ANC to consolidate and redouble its efforts to
bring about fundamental change in the South African society.

The masses of the people expected the ANC, amongst others, to continue to
champion their cause, to be tough in carrying out our transformation
programmes, to mobilise them into developmental initiatives and to improve
their lives. Therefore the ANC will intensify its programme for
reconstruction and development and conduct a sustained campaign against
poverty and underdevelopment by using instruments of the state and that of
the people.

Among those priorities are the finalisation of the industrial strategy to
promote job creation, assisting SMME's and co-ops with access to capital,
building capacity through Government procurement policies, speeding up
rural development and urban renewal strategies, expansion of the
infrastructure and development programmes, diversifying its ownership of
resources to the new Minerals Bill and speeding up of the comprehensive
social security policy.

The ANC is the only organisation attempting to achieve a fundamental
nonracial society. [Interjections.] Nonracism gets lost when we attack
racism and we are perceived as being anti-white. I am unpacking the two
nations analysis and our ideal of building one nation which is united in
its commitment to prosperity for all and working for the benefit of the
many, and not just a few.

The ANC improved its overall percentage vote in the Western Cape.
[Interjections.] It achieved a 3% gain from the last local government
elections. The ANC now controls three councils in the province, compared to
the DA's eight, with 14 councils hung. [Interjections.] The DA's share of
the vote fell by 1,6%.

One of those ANC councils in the Western Cape is the town of Beaufort West
which, after the President's visit to launch the ANC manifesto in the area,
won with a resounding victory of 63%. [Applause.] At that launch the
President made fundamental commitments to the poor of this country - free
water and electricity ... [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Thanks to the pretty girl.

Ms N E HANGANA: That hon member was not one of them.

That commitment of Comrade President has been implemented by the ANC
council in Beaufort West and all the poor communities in that area are
saying: ``The President has given this to us''.

Let us look at the DA-controlled unicity by way of considering the two
scenarios before us. When the councillors tabled a question which enquired
about the implementation of the programme relating to free water and
electricity, the answer they got from the DA-led council, which appeared in
the Cape Argus, read as follows: Why is the ANC in a hurry?

Here it is in the Cape Argus! Now why is the DA not treating the basic
needs of the poor as a priority? Have they already forgotten their campaign
slogans, such as ... ``Keep the ANC out''? They managed to instil fear in
the hearts and minds of whites by ringing the alarm bells on equal rates.

The gap between the rich and the poor is ever widening, and in the Western
Cape it is going well for the wealthy. These are the two nations we are
talking about. The apartheid economic plan like the Canal Walk and the
Grand West are all concentrated in the north-western part of the area. The
fact of the matter is that the majority of the communities live in
Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha, which have no infrastructure that empowers
communities. [Interjections.] The poor in the city earn less than R1 000,
and constitute a third of the city's people.

Let me quote from an article in yesterday's Cape Argus, which refers to
what the ANC will be doing for the poor in this province: ``Mitchells
Plain, Khayelitsha set for Mbeki's operation upgrade.'' How do they like
that? [Interjections.] It clearly illustrates that the ANC respects the
mandate it had been given by the voters. We do not use the suffering of our
people for political gain.

In his address, the President very briefly touched on past imbalances and
human rights violations, a past of high levels of crime, violence and
corruption. The Leader of the Opposition was pained by the President's
dwelling on the past. Let me tell him one or two things. This Government is
at pains to try to address the garbage of the past and we shall continue
talking about our painful past until they drop dead. [Interjections.] The
DA is desperately trying to create the impression that they, particularly
Mr Tony Leon and Mr Douglas Gibson, are the crusaders of democracy. They
have now recently been joined by another chihuahua from the PAC, Patricia
de Lille. [Interjections.]

Mr Gibson arrived in South Africa as a foreigner during the late 1960s. Is
that right? Am I correct? And he is familiar with the history of what black
people went through in this country. Is that correct? I now want to ask him
and the rest of the phoneys where they were when the oppressed of this
country were crying out loud, maimed, killed, jailed and forced into exile?

In the late 1970s and 1980s, hundreds of white young men refused to be
conscripted into the apartheid army. [Interjections.] They were very brave
young white men who were prepared to be imprisoned by Jimmy Kruger and
Adriaan Vlok. Where were Mr Tony Leon and Mr Douglas Gibson? [Laughter.] We
who were on the receiving end of the brutal army never heard them utter a
single word. Tony Leon went and served gracefully in an apartheid army that
raided and killed black people in the townships. [Applause.]

The DA always claims that the Western Cape is the best run province. Let us
look at how it is run. The Western Cape Province, which is led by the DA,
has the highest number of TB cases in the whole country amongst the poor.
Secondly, it has the highest crime rate. Ndiyaxoka Thangana? [Am I lying,
Thangana?] [Laughter.] [Interjections.] Just over three weeks ago, school
kids were shot dead in gang-related violence. Where was Mr Tony Leon? He
never uttered a word. He was silent. He is never vocal on issues affecting
the safety and welfare of the poor. Mr Leon will never become the president
of this country. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, besides the hon member Hangana, one of the
factors which contributes to South Africa's economic problems is the Afro-
pessimism which partly arises from the levels of corruption in some
countries. However, our own Government's handling of the proposed arms deal
inquiry could not have given a better impression of a cover-up if it tried.

After the Auditor-General reported material deviations from generally
accepted procurement practice, the Standing Committee on Public Accounts
decided unanimously to call for further investigations. The Auditor-
General, the Heath Special Investigating Unit, the Public Protector and the
Office for  Serious Economic Offences started planning how to co-ordinate
their activities.

After allocating responsibilities among themselves, they summarised their
progress and included the following statement:


  Heath Special Investigating Unit - The team requires the special skills
  and experience of the Unit, and therefore requests Scopa to make a
  recommendation to the President to approve a proclamation for the Unit,
  as the contribution of the Unit to the investigation could be
  significant.

However, early in January this year, Government clearly decided to take
action and do its best to discredit Judge Heath, the Auditor-General's
Review and Scopa. The Ministers of Defence, Finance and Trade and Industry,
and for Public Enterprises made dramatic appearances on TV and referred to:


  ... the ill-informed conclusions drawn from the Auditor-General's review
  and the Scopa report.

A week later, the hon the Deputy President, Mr Zuma, wrote an astonishing
letter attacking Scopa and its chairperson. Much of his letter was based on
the following assertion:


  Scopa states that it is interested to carry out an investigation because
  our Government, foreign governments and the prime contractors, major
  international companies, are prone to corruption and dishonesty.

That was a statement which Scopa never made. Further on in his letter, the
Deputy President said:
  We hope this strange manner of proceeding was not driven by a
  determination to find the executive guilty at all costs, based on the
  assumption that we have already mentioned, that the executive is prone to
  corruption and dishonesty.

This is an astonishing statement to make in respect of a parliamentary
committee, the majority of which are the ANC's representatives!

What seems to escape the Deputy President and other Cabinet Ministers is
that a number of the allegations are made in respect of improper behaviour
or corruption on the part of people who are close friends, colleagues or
relatives of the executive itself. For anyone to believe that the executive
are therefore impartial in this matter is stretching credulity a bit far.

On the same day, the President made a special live television broadcast. By
using selective quotes and false information the President made a fool of
himself and embarrassed South Africa in the process. His dramatic display
of an organogram which he falsely linked to Judge Heath was just one of his
blunders. He correctly pointed out that two advocates had indicated that,
on the basis of the documents which they had seen, and I quote:


  ... at this stage there is no prima facie evidence in law that any person
  or persons committed a criminal offence.

What he withheld from the public is the fact that the same advocates had
also reported that, and I quote:


  We are of the view that the preparatory criminal investigation being
  conducted ... is warranted and justified.


  In addition there are sufficient grounds for a special investigating unit
  to conduct an investigation, and, in our our opinion, such an
  investigation is warranted. We agree with the conclusions of ...

and they referred to it as the special committee on public accounts


  ... namely that the investigation would be best conducted by a
  multidisciplinary team consisting of the Office for Serious Economic
  Offences ... the Auditor-General, the Public Protector and the Special
  Investigating Unit. Due to the scope of the investigation, it is, in our
  opinion imperative that all the agencies referred to above should be
  involved at the earliest possible stage.

But even that was not the end of it. Ten days later, the Chair of the ANC's
Scopa study group was summarily dismissed and a group of ANC heavies was
brought in. Furthermore, the ANC Chief Whip, who is one of those against
whom accusations had been levelled, has indicated that he will personally
be attending some of the study group's meetings. What Government has
succeeded in doing is to destroy the credibility of Scopa, the
investigation into the arms deal and their professed commitment to rooting
out corruption.

In his farewell speech to Parliament on 26 March 1999, former President
Mandela said, and I quote:


  You have ensured that this Parliament is no rubber stamp in the hands of
  Government and given birth to a new democratic political culture.

How hollow those words would sound today.
This ANC Government has done grievous harm to South Africa's reputation,
our prospects for investment, economic growth and job creation. They have
given Afro-pessimists all over the world an opportunity to say: I told you
so. [Interjections.] They must have known that their words and actions
would harm South Africa. Yet, they went ahead anyway. The only conclusion
that one can draw is that they fear that if the whole truth were to be
revealed, the harm to the ANC and its Government would be even greater.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Adv J H DE LANGE: Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order: As you heard,
Mr Ken Andrew accused the President of basing and saying certain things on
false evidence. That is definitely unparliamentary. I ask that that be
immediately withdrawn. I would like to inform you that there is a
possibility that the ANC will look into the matter and also whether this
should not be investigated further as an accusation of a decision based on
false evidence by the President. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order!
Adv J H DE LANGE: Madam Speaker, that member does not have any brains thus
he should just ``shup''. I ask that the words that it was based on false
evidence be immediately withdrawn.

The SPEAKER: Order! Mr De Lange, I heard the word ``false'' attached to
``information''. I may be wrong. I will consult Hansard and report to the
House first thing tomorrow morning.

Adv J H DE LANGE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. [Interjections.]

Mr V G SMITH: Madam Speaker, Comrade President, hon members, from the onset
let us indicate that the majority of members in this House and, indeed, the
majority of members in South Africa salute the hon the President for his
vision as encompassed in his state of the nation speech on Friday.

Public interest on the role of portfolio committees of Parliament,
Parliament itself as an institution and the relationship between
Parliament, the executive and the judiciary has been at an all-time high,
thanks to people like the hon Andrew and the hon Holomisa. This interest or
focus was, to a large extent, brought to the fore as a result of the report
to the National Assembly by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts late
last year. We will not comment on the actual procurement, its merits or
otherwise. However, we wish to focus this discussion on the perceptions
created and signals sent to the public at large by various individuals and
organisations for reasons best known to themselves.

We wish to deal with these perceptions within the context of the
President's state of the nation address last Friday, where he observed, and
I quote:


  We share a common destiny from which none of us can escape because,
  together, we are human, we are South African, we are African.

Despite this call, there seems to be a golden thread throughout recent
comments, and even today, that seeks to distinguish the efforts and
capabilities of individuals at the expense of the greater collective. Added
to this seems to be the desire to show up this Government as one that
possesses no will to stamp out corruption or, at worst, to be corrupt
itself. History will show to all that care to be objective that never
before has there been any political party or any other institution in South
Africa that can claim to have championed the fight against corruption like
the ANC. [Applause.]

Prior to 1994, the notion of transparent and open government did not exist
in this country. Those that, today, claim to be custodians of these
impeccable standards and morals had the ability to remove corrupt officials
and governments in the past, yet stood by and, indeed, in some instances
were members or active participants of these organs of state that were
corrupt to the core, including the homelands.

When, at the beginning of this year, the New NP and its partner,  the DP,
overhauled the entire team that served on the public accounts committee,
with exclusively white members, their expressed intention, according to
their spokespeople, was to introduce individuals that were seen to be party
heavyweights and, therefore, up to the task. One wonders why this action
was not seen for what it really was: That of ensuring that the party line
on certain matters would be projected and, therefore, by definition, in my
own view, politicising the Standing Committee.

The media, print and electronic, and all the other critics were silent.
When the majority party embarked upon a similar operation all hell broke
loose, because independent thinkers within the party were being sacrificed
in preference to party loyalists, according to the opposition. Furthermore,
one of these very opposition party members who were redeployed to the
public accounts committee is on record in a morning daily newspaper as
having remarked that the committee was ... ``running a grave risk of
reaching the end of the nonpartisan consensual style that marked its
operations'', simply because of interventions made by the ANC to its own
membership on the public accounts committee.

All kinds of dangers were suddenly to emerge, not least that of threatening
the culture and apolitical nature of this committee, thereby diminishing
the committee's ability to provide acceptable levels of oversight. I think
it is important, at this point, to remind this House that all members of
Parliament are here on the ticket of a political party. It is strange and,
in fact, nonsensical to be a member of Parliament on a ticket of a
political party and then expect to act independently of the party that made
it possible for one to be a member of Parliament in the first instance.
[Applause.]

The suggestion that the standing committee will be more effective if its
character is apolitical cannot go unchallenged. I want to reiterate that
the ANC, as a political movement, has, since its inception fought for,
achieved, and will defend, the principle of transparency and noncorruption
within Government and beyond. Why is there today a perceived threat of
rampant corruption under the leadership of this Government? Why is it that
these people who led the liberation of this country for decades cannot be
trusted? Why is there the sustained effort to undermine the Government and
the leaders of the majority party?

Mr M J ELLIS: Why was Andrew Feinstein told to resign?

Mr V G SMITH: To the hon Tony Leon, why are those who had the ability to
correct these very actions prior to 1994 today the ones who make the most
noise?

On Wednesday last week the nation was assured by the convenor of the joint
team that is responsible for the investigation of the arms procurement
deal, consisting of the Auditor-General, the Public Protector and the
Office for Serious Economic Offences, that, indeed, the investigation was
on track and, more importantly, that their competencies were sufficient to
cover every aspect of the investigation.

Yet, there are still elements within and outside this Parliament that
insist on the inclusion of the special investigating unit. The perception
that the investigation conducted by the three components, in the absence of
the participation of the special investigating unit, cannot produce a
report of integrity, is very disturbing.

In addition, to insist, as some do, that the special investigating unit in
its current form must be part of the investigation flies in the face of the
recent ruling by the highest court in this land, namely that the inclusion
of the special investigating unit in its current form is unconstitutional.
Therefore, the President was correct in refusing to sign a proclamation
authorising the inclusion of such a unit at this time. [Applause.]
Yet again, one must question the motives that drive these sentiments. Is
this not yet another attempt to undermine the collective, because of the
absence of an individual organisation? Surely, no one can question the
determination and capability - academically or otherwise - of the three
agencies, as well as this Government, involved in the investigation. The
question is why then is there a consistent message send out by certain
individuals and organisations that there has to be a cover-up, by this
Government, of corruption, despite the reassurances given to the public
accounts committee and the nation last week? I suspect, as bitter a pill as
it might be to swallow, that these perceptions are informed by an element
of racism, despite the correct call by the President for all the people of
this country to unite in action for change. [Interjections.]

The integrity, morals and abilities of the three agencies responsible for
the investigation, as well as that of the Government, are being questioned.
Is it because the leadership of these three agencies and that of the
current Government happen to be black? [Interjections.] The majority party
and Government have been consistent in saying that the investigation must
continue as rapidly as possible. The majority party and Government are on
record as having said that wherever corruption is uncovered, those
implicated must be dealt with unconditionally and in accordance with the
law of the land. Let everybody, including the hon Holomisa, who have reason
to believe that there is corruption in the arms deal, assist by providing
concrete evidence to the investigating team, instead of being mischievous
and destructive.

The people of this country liberated themselves even from an evil as great
as apartheid. We have no doubt that the people of this country will
liberate themselves from corruption and crime wherever it exists. This will
all be achieved without the help of those prophets of doom that are
hellbent on undermining all attempts to see this country develop to the
potential that South Africa and its people possess. Hon members, comrades,
the struggle to achieve a better life for all continues. Victory in this
regard is certain, and we the people shall overcome all obstacles despite
the DA. Maatla! [Power!] [Applause.]

Debate suspended.

The House adjourned at 17:55.

     thereby giving concrete expression to the common vision of a united,

     Considering that by the Algiers Declaration (AHG/Decl.1 (XXXV)) of 14

     Community;


     Determined to promote democratic principles and popular participation,
     to consolidate democratic institutions and culture and to ensure good
     governance;


     Further determined to promote and protect human and peoples' rights in

     other relevant human rights instruments;


     Conscious of the obligations and legal implications for Member States
     of the need to establish the Pan-African Parliament;

         Park Primary School which was used by children of members of

     The Speaker of the National Assembly
     Dr F.N. Ginwala
     P.O. Box 15
     CAPE TOWN
     8000


     31 January 2001


     Dear Madam Speaker


     I wish to thank you for your response to my letter in which you
     addressed some of the issues I had raised in my letter to the
     chairperson of the Standing Committee On Public Accounts.


     Your letter has assisted in clarifying the background to the issues,
     and the procedures followed by the National Assembly, which led to the
     preliminary report adopted by the National Assembly on the 3rd November
     2000.


     I further wish to concur with your observations that there are more
     issues that SCOPA needs to address before final conclusions are reached
     on the best way forward. In this regard, I appreciate your efforts to
     guide SCOPA in the process of finalising this matter.


     I am also pleased to learn that the National Assembly is due to receive
     a report from this Committee, and that you have also requested them to
     respond to my letter of the 19th January 2001. I also hope that in the
     pending report to Parliament, SCOPA would be able to address the
     matters raised in the first National Assembly report with more clarity.
     Amongst the issues that SCOPA would have to respond to are the
     following:


     _ What evidence was gathered by this Committee, upon which it bases its
         assertion that defence acquisitions are usually attended by
         malpractice, with the purchasing countries being victims of such
         malpractice?


     _ What evidence does the Committee have that in this specific instance,
         such malpractice occurred, as well as evidence of the resultant
         harm to South Africa?


     The National Assembly's preliminary report further makes allegations
     regarding flawed selection procedures with regard to the appointment of
     contractors. It would be helpful therefore if the Committee, in the
     subsequent report, answered the following questions:


     _ On what information does SCOPA base its conclusion that improper
         influence might have been exerted in `certain of these
         selections'?


     _ Which of these selections are being referred to and who are the
         influential parties?


     _ What evidence caused SCOPA to reach the conclusion that influential
         parties might have influenced the choice of sub-contractors?
     _ Why did SCOPA omit to invite the Ministers who were involved in this
         process to clarify and answer questions, prior to the finalisation
         of the National Assembly's preliminary report?


     Madam Speaker, I am certain that, if the Second Report of SCOPA to
     Parliament responded to these questions, that will assist the National
     Assembly in its earnest search for the truth in this matter.


     Yours sincerely


     Jacob Zuma
     Leader of Government Business


     Referred to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts for consideration
     and report.
