                            ROAD SAFETY STRATEGY

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  delegates,  I  come
before hon members today to talk about the  very  important  issue  of  road
safety, but this is not a routine pep talk on  driving  carefully  over  the
approaching holiday season. This is the announcement of a  launch  date  for
my department's completely new strategy for safer roads in South Africa.

On 20 November at the the MTN Sundome in Gauteng I will have  the  privilege
of going to the public of South Africa with our new document,  The  Road  to
Safety 2001-2005. I can tell hon members that there is already  considerable
excitement and expectation, not only in  Government  but  right  across  the
transport industry. The Road  to  Safety  -  that  is  the  heading  of  the
document - represents  a  decisive  moment  of  opportunity  to  change  our
country's whole approach to road safety.

The strategy is a product  of  over  18  months  of  intensive  consultation
between Government, the entire land transport sector, technical  innovators,
safety pressure groups, NGOs and many civil society organisations.  We  have
listened to everyone and incorporated many suggestions. We think  that  what
we have now come out with is a solid, practical, doable set  of  programmes,
projects and baseline positions for legislation  and  negotiation  with  the
industry.

We think that the strategy is solid for two main reasons;  firstly,  because
it already has strong industry support behind  it;  and,  secondly,  because
its central  approach  is  to  build  partnerships  and  a  sense  of  joint
ownership at every level.

What is so significant about The Road to Safety? What  is  its  relationship
to  the  Arrive  Alive  programme?  The  answers  to  both   questions   are
interlinked. The key thing about the strategy is that it is  proactive,  not
reactive. We have taken time out to step back from the  daily  pressures  of
enforcement, adjudication and persuasion and looked at the whole picture  of
what makes roads safe or dangerous for the users. We have pulled  everything
apart  and  put  it  back  together  again  in  blocks  that  fit  together,
reinforcing and supporting one another at every point.

We started out from the absolute basics: facts and questions.  For  example,
drivers drive on roads. How qualified are they to drive and what  are  their
attitudes? Pedestrians walk along and cross our roads.  How  well  are  they
trained and educated to do these apparently simple things? Drivers drive  in
vehicles. How fit are these  vehicles  to  be  on  the  road?  What  is  the
condition of our roads infrastructure? Where, when and how do  most  of  the
crashes on our roads take place? How do we  get  the  right  combination  of
forces to the right places at the right times? What are our enforcement  and
regulatory systems? Where are they failing? What are  the  key  issues  that
have in the past given rise to public  cynicism  about  the  possibility  of
winning  the  battle  for  safety?  How  do  we  fight  against   widespread
aggression, irresponsibility and contempt for the law amongst  many  of  our
road users? And, finally, how do we  convince  people  that  the  battle  is
winnable? How do we build the critical mass  of  public  support  that  will
lead to a new  culture  of  voluntary  law  compliance,  responsibility  and
mutual respect? There are many questions.

The Road to Safety asks all these questions and gives  us  a  framework  for
answering them positively. It does not pull any punches about what is  wrong
with the systems and structures that we  have  relied  on  up  to  now.  The
strategy shows how they can and  must  be  corrected  and  transformed.  The
strategy does not run away from the  problem  of  resource  constraints.  It
recognises that there is no bottomless well  of  fiscal  resources  to  fund
every  urgently  necessary  corrective  project.  Instead,  it   prioritises
creative and  imaginative  use  of  existing  human  resources,  skills  and
ingenuity wherever they may be located in our society. It  throws  the  door
wide open to partnerships of every kind in every sector of road safety.

The  Road  to  Safety  challenges  all  three  spheres  of  government.   It
challenges the transport industry, civil  society  organisations,  and  each
and every individual South African to come  to  the  party.  It  proposes  a
combination of various elements, that  is  Government  intervention  through
systems overhauls and legislation; an all-out war on  fraud  and  corruption
in driver licensing and vehicle testing  and  registration;  regulation  and
self-regulation in the road freight and public passenger transport  sectors;
the application of technological innovations in the  vehicle  safety  field;
the user-pays principle  wherever applicable;  public-private  partnerships;
and passenger and community empowerment initiatives.

In short, the strategy says that the responsibility for safety on our  roads
belongs to all of us, and that each one of us can make a contribution.  This
can be anything from joint sponsorship of  a  major  project  to  taking  an
active role in one's community road safety forum, to taking  one's  friend's
car keys away when she or he says, ``Ag, I have only had a couple  over  the
limit,'' and not allowing her or him to drive.

I will save the details of the projects  and  processes  that  the  strategy
sets forth until  the  day  of  the  launch,  which  is  20  November  as  I
indicated, when I will ask all of our people to  sit  down  and  think  very
hard about the different kinds of contributions which they could make.  What
I want to say today is: From now on, The Road to  Safety  is  our  guide  to
action and commitment while at the  same  time  the  Arrive  Alive  campaign
continues  stronger,  more  focused  and  more  concentrated  on  its   core
operational functions of enforcement,  education  and  communication  -  365
days a year, seven days a week and 24 hours a day. Just as the whole aim  in
the Road to Safety strategy is to get proposals off  paper  and  into  real,
concrete, jointly owned projects, so in Arrive Alive  do  we  want  to  show
members  what  we  have  already  started  to  achieve  by  making  a  clear
separation between strategic reform and day-to-day operations.

From October last year, when I signalled the beginning of this  major  shift
in the orientation of the Arrive  Alive  campaign,  we  have  been  steadily
finding our way towards better co-ordination and accountability. When I  say
``we'', I mean  national  and  provincial  governments  together.  All  law-
enforcement and communication programmes undertaken at national,  provincial
and metropolitan or local level are now considered to be part of the  Arrive
Alive campaign, even though some activities do not  qualify  for  additional
Arrive Alive funding.

Provincial Arrive Alive business plans now have to be  developed  in  strict
accordance with the national plan, and  all  key  operational  action  plans
must follow the logic of this plan. To qualify for funding,  all  provincial
and local traffic  authorities  must  submit  detailed  monthly  reports  on
expenditure and programmes undertaken.

Arrive Alive's terms of reference have been expanded  to  include:  firstly,
much better co-operation between traffic law enforcement and  the  judiciary
to increase the provision of dedicated regional and roadside traffic  courts
and to radically speed up the adjudication process and the  finalisation  of
summonses  and  notices  issued;  secondly,  greatly  improved   information
collection, analysis and reporting systems for  better  decision-making  and
better reporting on achievements; thirdly, more sharply targeted  awareness,
communication and  advertising  initiatives  in  support  of  specific  law-
enforcement  actions;   fourthly,   the   more   systematic   education   of
schoolchildren, adults and communities on pedestrian and other  road  safety
issues; and  fifthly,  community  participation  in  the  identification  of
hazardous locations on the road and street network,  supported  by  low-cost
remedial engineering works to make the road environments safer.

Let me just comment on this last point. I will tell  the  members  what  was
achieved in just one such project that I visited last year,  right  here  on
our doorstep in the Western Cape in the  Winelands  District  Council  area.
This is a live issue for a number of members  of  the  Public  Services  and
Minerals and Energy select committees  who,  on  Monday  this  week,  joined
their colleagues from the National Assembly portfolio committee  on  a  very
similar fact-finding trip to the Winelands. For those members  of  the  NCOP
who did not make the trip, let me paint a picture for them and  invite  them
to visit the project, to see for themselves what can be done if there is co-
operation between all stakeholders and role-players.

What  was  done  was  that  five  different  localities  were  identified  -
Simondium,  Koelenhof,  Vlottenburg,  Jamestown  and  Elsenberg.  The  local
communities and schools were fully engaged in  identifying  the  key  danger
spots, and there was detailed and thorough consultation among     all  these
people - the council, that is the local authority; the  traffic  department,
its engineers and the local NGO which  is  called  Women  on  Farms.  It  is
remarkable what results one achieves when  women  begin  to  participate  in
programmes. The result of this particular consultation was  that,  together,
they came up with simple practical solutions that were affordable, and  they
worked.

On the physical side, these included: first,  new  pedestrian  walkways  and
bridges; second, specially widened sand and  cement  sidewalks;  third,  new
overhead lighting; fourth,  traffic  island  improvements;  and  fifth,  new
speed reduction warning signs and new pedestrian traffic lights. That is  on
the physical side - some work which had to be done  with  a  little  bit  of
expense, but manageable under the circumstances.

On  the  human  side,  the  steps  included  the  widespread  promotion   of
pedestrian reflective bands in all the local schools.  In  other  words,  we
have children wearing reflective bands so  that  they  are  easily  visible.
Also, there is the daily monitoring of  pedestrian  crossings,  which  means
community participation.

Thirdly, we have the use of additional local transport to help children  get
to school safely in the mornings and get home safely in the  evenings.  This
means  a  programme  of  co-operation  between  the  different   levels   of
government,  local  law-enforcement  authorities   and   local   communities
together with the schools. As I was saying, this co-operation has worked  in
so far as this particular project is concerned.

One may ask: What were the results from a safety point of view?  I  can  say
to the members now that, the space of one year, from 1998-99  to  1999-2000,
collisions between vehicles  and  pedestrians  came  down  by  41%  in  this
district, and pedestrian deaths dropped by an incredible  82%  in  the  same
period - a remarkable result because of simple things which we could all  do
together without a great deal of expense. In just  this  one  area  of  road
safety, we can start to get a glimpse of what  we  could  achieve  over  the
next five years by generalising but practicalising  a  partnership  approach
to every corner of the country.

I respectfully suggest to hon members  that  this  is  one  area  of  active
participation in which all of us could immediately become involved  when  we
go back to our home bases after Parliament rises. My  department,  with  the
support of the CSIR, is ready to make available some very  practical,  well-
tested toolkits, if I could put it that way, for setting up  community  road
safety initiatives of the kind I have  just  outlined.  My  staff,  both  in
Pretoria and the few who are here in Cape Town, are ready and waiting to  be
of assistance as well.

In conclusion, I want to say that what we do not want - and I am  sure  that
this House also does not want it - since this is just a debate is merely  an
academic discussion. I think what hon members and delegates  would  want  is
information which would empower them to go back to  local  communities,  and
to participate in programmes, or launch or initiate  such  programmes  which
will make a positive impact on the road safety situation on our roads.

I want to suggest that one of the key areas of intervention is  with  regard
to pedestrians' safety, and in the same way that these pilot  projects  have
yielded the results, I am very confident that if we were to go to our  local
communities and initiate programmes based on that experience, we  can  begin
to make a difference on our roads throughout our country.

With one eye on the launch of the Road  to  Safety  programme,  which  takes
place on 20 November, and with another on  the  long  summer  holiday  lying
ahead of us, let me invite members respectfully to join us in this  exciting
new beginning for road safety in our country, and, at the  same  time,  wish
everyone a safe and peaceful festive  season  and  new  year.  May  all  the
members arrive alive! [Applause.]

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Chairperson, on behalf of the Select Committee on  Public
Services, I want to congratulate the hon the Minister of Transport,  Comrade
Dullah, on the presentation of the final draft of The Road to Safety:  2000-
2005.

The road safety strategies of our  Government  are  the  blueprint  for  the
complete overhaul of  our  country's  road  safety  and  traffic  management
system and structures.

The final draft that has been presented today by the hon  the  Minister,  or
rather, the statement that he has just  read  to  us,  has  gone  through  a
rigorous process of consultation and fine-tuning, and we  proudly  say  that
it carries the blessings of all relevant stakeholders  because  its  aim  is
very clear, which is to create a framework for co-ordinated  action  between
all stakeholders, which will lay a firm basis in terms of which  road  users
will display greater responsibility and mutual respect.

To ensure strict compliance with road  traffic  legislation  and  to  create
enforcement and adjudication measures that will work, the Minister must,  as
a matter of fact, ensure that  we  enforce  the  law,  especially  on  long-
distance trips where drivers should be forced not to drive  more  than  four
hours, especially in the public transport sphere, where  they  must  relieve
each other. Some measures proposed for  road  safety  in  terms  of  vehicle
fitness include additional funding for provinces  to  ensure  compliance  of
public vehicle stations and consultation with flight  and  public  transport
operators and unions on the implementation of a standard  national  code  of
practice, and this has been long overdue.

The increase in funding to the provinces is most welcome,  because  it  will
enable the provinces to review the operational  systems  and  procedures  of
their  vehicle  testing  stations  and  implement  new  management  systems,
procedures and training standards.

In addition  to  these  focused  areas  of  the  road  safety  strategy,  it
highlights a number of areas where problems exist, such  as  inconsistencies
in sentences for road traffic offences, the high rate  of  youth  casualties
on the road, the low level of specialist road safety  knowledge  and  skills
among teachers, and the fragmentation of statistics on road accidents.  Some
of the measures proposed to address the problems  include  interacting  with
the Department of Justice and the National Director of Public  Prosecutions.


Having outlined the most important objective of the  road  safety  document,
all that remains to be said revolves around  the  actions  proposed  by  the
document  together  with  the  Arrive  Alive  campaign.  The   question   of
retreading of tyres needs to be looked at, because they  are  the  cause  of
most accidents.

Forward to the zero  tolerance  approach  to  speeding,  driving  under  the
influence of alcohol and overloading. MEC Sbu Ndebele  said  in  his  speech
yesterday that the Minister must  arrest  those  who  drink  and  drive  and
penalise them when they are sober. [Applause.]

Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, will the next  speaker  be  making  his  maiden
speech since he is speaking here after two and a half years? [Laughter.]

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: Deputy Chairperson, it is in fact not my maiden speech.
In addressing the Road Traffic Transport Board in July  2001,  the  hon  the
Minister of Transport stated that:


  South Africa's new road strategy will be a partnership involving all  our
  people. It must become an instrument  for  turning  road  safety  into  a
  national crusade.

Therefore, when the hon the Minister  of  Transport  speaks  of  a  national
crusade, one is perhaps entitled to feel optimistic that the  depth  of  the
magnitude of the problem is appreciated by the Minister.

The Arrive Alive campaign has proved  that  focused  attention  to  speeding
vehicles and the booking of reckless drivers does have a positive effect  on
bringing the road deaths and injuries down. We welcome the manner  in  which
the Arrive Alive campaign has been restructured to go beyond  the  focus  on
roads only during the ultra-busy holidays periods at Easter  and  Christmas.
A planned and co-ordinated  year-round  enforcement  strategy  with  visible
policing will be a vital component in  this  regard.  We  also  welcome  the
issuing of reflective armbands and  sashes  in  red  spot  areas  near,  for
example, schools and churches, and the greater availability of  Breathalyser
testers.

The setting up of  roadside  courts  and  issuing  of  spot  fines  and  the
proposed ``sin bin'' for sleeping-off by  intoxicated  drivers  are  further
positive moves which should be augmented and supported. The  menace  on  our
roads remains the inordinately  high  number  of  unlicensed,  speeding  and
drunken drivers, the overloading of cargo trucks and, last  but  not  least,
the growing amount of fraud  and  corruption  in  driver  training,  licence
testing, vehicle testing of  roadworthiness  and  the  vehicle  registration
system.

Any strategy for road safety will fail if inadequate attention  is  paid  to
these all-important areas. In other words, law enforcement is  of  paramount
importance in the whole strategy of road safety in South Africa.

The final point, in conclusion, is that the lack of road  use  knowledge  by
mostly rural people remains a national tragedy. When one peruses  statistics
pertaining to road deaths, one is dismayed by the number of pedestrians  who
become victims unnecessarily. This is unacceptable  in  a  country  such  as
ours and requires immediate attention. [Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, hier aan die begin van my  toespraak  wil  ek  die
agb Minister bedank vir die ywer wat hy en sy departement aan die dag lê  in
hul pogings om ons paaie te beveilig en  ons  padsterftes  te  laat  afneem.
Soos wat my party die Arrive Alive projek gesteun het, en steeds nog  steun,
steun ons ook heelhartiglik die Road to Safety 2001-2005 wat op 20  November
geloods gaan word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, at the beginning of my speech let me  thank  the
hon the Minister for the diligence he and his department have  displayed  in
their efforts to safeguard our roads and reduce the number of  road  deaths.
In the same way that my party has supported, and still supports, the  Arrive
Alive project, we also wholeheartedly support the Road to Safety  2001-2005,
which is to be launched on 20 November.]

In the briefing by the department, the selection  committee  was  told  that
the Road Safety project would now become the  parent  of  the  Arrive  Alive
campaign. At the time, it sounded a bit odd to  me,  because  I  have  never
heard about a child being born before the parent.

Ek  glo  dat  die  bedoeling  opreg  is,  en  dat  Arrive  Alive   nou   die
veiligheidsarm gaan wees wat sewe dae 'n week, 24 uur 'n dag,  en  reg  deur
die jaar sy rol as  verkeersbestuurskoördineerder  sal  kan  speel.  Ons  is
dankbaar dat dit nie meer net 'n seisoenale aksie sal wees nie. Ek  wil  ook
die hoop uitspreek dat die doelstellings wat  gestel  word,  naamlik  'n  5%
afname van padsterftes per jaar tot 2004  en  10%  jaarliks  tot  2009,  wel
bereik sal kan word, en dat sukses behaal sal word  oor  die  hele  spektrum
van padveiligheidsprojekte.

Al  die  projekte  wat  die  agb  Minister  vandag  bekend  gestel  het,  is
belangrik. Om egter die belangrikste doelstellings te  kan  bereik,  benodig
die  agb   Minister   die   nodige   fondse.   Die   opgradering   van   die
padinfrastruktuur  en  die  bekamping  van  oorbelading  van   swaarvoertuie
alleen, benodig miljarde rande. Behoorlike wetstoepassing, met ander  woorde
zero toleransie vir spoedoortredings, bestuur onder die invloed  van  drank,
dwelms en selfone, en ook om korrupsie en bedrog wat  gepleeg  word  by  die
toetsing   van   voertuie   en   die    uitreiking    van    bestuurs-    en
padvaardigheidslisensies te beveg, gaan ook miljarde rande kos.

As daar nie aansienlik meer goed opgeleide verkeersbeamptes, wat  behoorlike
salarisse ontvang, aangestel  gaan  word  nie,  sal  dié  doelstellings  nie
bereik word nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I believe the intention to be sincere, and that the  Arrive  Alive  project
will now become the safety arm which, for seven days a week, 24 hours a  day
and throughout the year, will be able to play its role  as  traffic  control
co-ordinator. We are grateful that it will no  longer  be  just  a  seasonal
action. I also want to express the hope that the goals that have  been  set,
namely a reduction in road deaths of 5% per year  until  2004  and  10%  per
year until 2009, can be reached and that success  will  be  achieved  across
the whole spectrum of road safety projects.

All of the projects introduced by the hon the Minister today are  important.
However, in order to reach the most important goals the Minister  needs  the
necessary  funds.  Upgrading  the  road  infrastructure  and  combating  the
overloading of heavy vehicles alone requires billions of rands.  Proper  law
enforcement, in other words zero tolerance for  speeding  offences,  driving
under the influence of alcohol, drugs and cellphones, as well  as  combating
the corruption and fraud committed  in  the  testing  of  vehicles  and  the
issuing of drivers' and roadworthy licences is also going to cost billions.

If significantly more well-trained  traffic  officers,  who  receive  decent
salaries, are not going to be appointed, these goals will not be reached.]

There is a huge task lying ahead for  us  all.  I  believe  that  with  this
realistic approach to road safety, the Department can  reach  its  goal.   I
therefore beg today for the support of all members in  this  House  and  for
Parliament's support in the form of sufficient funds. I would like  to  wish
everybody in this House a very happy Christmas and festive  season,  and  to
all the people travelling on the roads a very  safe  and  pleasant  journey.
Please arrive alive and intact. [Applause.]

Mnu M J BHENGU: Sihlalo,  ngicabanga  ukuthi  lingatholakala  isu  mhlawumbe
lokuba kube khona ukuphepha emigwaqeni esiyisebenzisayo.

Kukhona isu lokuphepha elingenziwa lalabo  abashayela  izimoto,  kube  khona
elingenziwa lalabo abasebenzisa umgwaqo, abahamba ngezinyawo kanye  nelalabo
abathuthwa yizimoto. Ngakho-ke kusho ukuthi mhlawumbe umNyango  lo  ungazama
ukuthi wenze uphenyo lokuhlola ukuthi kungenziwa kanjani lokho.

Lokho kudingeka kube uphenyo olunzulu oluzokwenza ukuthi kwehle  lokhu  kufa
okungaka okwenzekayo kubantu bakithi. Sibonile ukuthi isiqubulo lesi  esithi
``Arrive Alive'' sisebenzile. Kodwa-ke asisebenzanga  ngokuphelele.  Kukhona
okusadinga ukuthi kwenziwe kumbe kusona noma kube  khona  isu  elisha,  noma
mhlawumbe sona isiqubulo senziwe ngcono. Ngiyavumelana mina nalo mbono  othi
makube khona okuthize okwenziwayo  mayelana  nokuthi  kucutshungulwe  ukuthi
kushaywe umThetho wePhalamende  oqinisa  imithetho  yemigwaqo  ukuze  abantu
abasebenzisa umgwaqo bazi ukuthi kukhona imithetho enjalo.

Sengathi ingenyuka inhlawulo yalabo abangayigcini imithetho yemigwaqo  ngoba
abantu  bakithi  abasayihloniphi  impilo  yabantu  njengokuthi  nje   umuntu
ashayele   ephuzile   noma   esebenzisa   umakhalekhukhwini.   Izinto   lezo
engicabanga ukuthi kungafuneka ukuthi  imithetho  iqiniswe  kuzo.  Ngakho-ke
ngicabanga  ukuthi  ngiyavumelana  ...  (Translation  of   Zulu   paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, I think a plan to bring  about  safety  on  our
roads can be found.

A plan can be made for those who drive  cars,  those  who  use  roads,  like
pedestrians and  passengers.  Therefore,  this  means  that  the  Department
should investigate how this can be done.

This means that there should be a thorough investigation into how to  reduce
the number of people who are dying on our roads. We have  noticed  that  the
Arrive Alive campaign has worked well,  but  not  satisfactorily.  Something
needs to be done to it or we need to come up  with  a  new  plan.  Maybe  we
should come up with  an  improved  campaign.  I  support  the  opinion  that
something must be done concerning the investigation into passing an  Act  of
Parliament which will strengthen road laws so  that  road  users  will  know
that such legislation has come into existence.

I would like the penalty for those who violate road rules to  be  increased,
because some drivers do not respect people's lives,  like  those  who  drive
while they are drunk or using a cellphone. Those are the things on which  we
should strengthen laws. Therefore I think I agree with ...]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I am rising on a point of order.  There  is
no translation service at the moment.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): I am told there is  no
translation. Anyway, continue Mr Bhengu.

Mnu M J BHENGU: Sihlalo,  ngakho-ke  ngibona  ukuthi  uNgqongqoshe  ubhekene
nenselele  lapho  yokuthi   kulesi   sikhathi   esawengamele   lo   mNyango,
kubalulekile  ukuthi  azame  ukwenza  uphenyo  olunzulu   lokuthola   ukuthi
ngempela, ngempela  yini  engenziwa.  Akulungile  lokhu  esikubona  kwenziwa
amatekisi namabhasi, ebulala abantu bakithi  ngendlela  enje,  lapho  umuntu
ethola ukuthi kufa khona amashumi ngamashumi noma amakhulu ngamakhulu.  Yize
umuntu engenaso isibalo senani labantu abafayo, siye  sibone  ukuthi  bayafa
abantu bakithi.

Ngicabanga ukuthi luyadingeka uphenyo.  Imigwaqo  ehamba  izimoto  ezithutha
abantu bakithi ayilungile. Nayo iyaphonsa esivivaneni  sokuthi  bafe  abantu
bakithi. Ngakho-ke ngiyavumelana nalo mbono oshiwo  uDokotela  uNel  wokuthi
akube  khona  i``holistic  approach.''  (Translation  of   Zulu   paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, I feel that the hon the Minister is faced  with
the challenge, while he is still the Minister of this department,  which  is
important, to try to launch a thorough investigation into what needs  to  be
done. What taxis and buses are doing  is  unacceptable,  as  they  kill  our
people, and people die in tens or hundreds.  Although  I  do  not  have  the
statistics, we see that our people are being killed on the roads.

I think we need an investigation. Roads used by cars that  transport  people
are not good. This contributes to the  death  of  our  people.  Therefore  I
share Dr Nel's opinion that there should be a holistic approach.]

Mr M J TLHAGALE: Chairperson, hon Minister and the honourable House, I  wish
to commend the hon the Minister for the trouble he takes  to  ensure  safety
on our roads. Precautionary measures are being advanced for  the  safety  of
the  public  in  general,  but  they  are  very  often  bedevilled  by   the
consumption of alcohol over the prescribed  limits.  Very  often  our  young
people are the worst culprits regarding the consumption of alcohol  and  the
abuse of drugs.

The case of Odendaal of the Free State, who, whilst under the  influence  of
liquor, tied Mosoko Rampuru to his bakkie and dragged him until he died,  is
one of the appalling incidents that  bedevil  race  relations.  However,  as
some commentators see it, elements of  racism  could  have  been  paramount,
rather than the consumption of alcohol.

Speeding is another contributing factor that is frustrating the road  safety
strategy and the Arrive Alive campaign. Many  pedestrians  have  lost  their
lives as a result of speeding, and very often a  speeding  vehicle  is  less
controllable than a slow-moving vehicle.

The use of a cellphone whilst driving is a distraction and has  resulted  in
many collisions owing to the divided attention of the driver. One  is  aware
that it has been outlawed, but  its  prohibition  has  not  been  vigorously
enforced so as to serve as a deterrent to other prospective drivers.

The new road safety strategy that the hon the Minister  intends  to  put  in
place shortly seems to be comprised of achievable elements, and it  has  our
undivided support. [Applause.]

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, hon Minister and members, there are two  critical
choices facing any nation in terms of its road safety strategy.  Choice  one
is to adopt an attitude  that  says  that  road  fatalities  are  a  natural
consequence of having motor vehicles on the roads.  In  this  case,  a  road
safety strategy  would  merely  revolve  around  reacting  to  accidents  by
providing on-the-spot assistance and medical treatment.

The second choice, which is the one we have made, is  to  accept  that  road
accidents are  occurrences  that  are  caused  by  a  number  of  underlying
problems which, if  properly  addressed,  can  reduce  the  number  of  road
fatalities.

As a country, we have committed ourselves  to  a  preventative  approach  to
road safety. We believe that safer, more secure roads with  better  drivers,
more reliable vehicles and a better regulated  public  transport  system  is
not only much more cost-effective, but will also save lives.

The new road safety strategy that was just  announced  by  the  Minister  of
Transport provides a framework for the achievement of the  above  objectives
by co-ordinating the actions among national, provincial and local  transport
departments. It directs itself  towards  addressing  the  underlying  causes
that have given rise to our road safety problems  by  taking  responsibility
for system and structural reforms, by mobilising  fiscal  resources  and  by
building   partnerships   with   the   private    sector,    nongovernmental
organisations and communities.  Its  key  objectives  are  to  prevent  road
accidents, to save lives and money, to  preserve  our  road  infrastructure,
and to achieve a systematic reduction in road  fatalities  between  now  and
the year 2009.

Addressing the underlying causes that have given rise to the high number  of
road fatalities has a subjective and an objective nature. On the  subjective
side, the problems include  the  disregard  for  road  traffic  legislation,
aggression towards other roads users and disregard for the  basic  rules  of
safe road usage. These are  human  errors  that  need  to  be  addressed  by
changing the mind-set of road users. On the objective side, the causes  that
have given rise to the carnage on our roads relate to  the  quality  of  our
roads, driver competence, vehicle fitness,  and  regulatory  and  monitoring
systems.

Over the past few years a number of  initiatives  have  been  undertaken  to
address both the subjective and objective  causes  that  give  rise  to  the
large number of fatalities on our roads. For example, new measures were  put
in place to deal with vehicle and driver fitness.

In terms of driver fitness,  legislation  has  already  been  enacted  which
formalises  and  regulates  driver  training  schools,   the   accreditation
criteria for owners have been tightened  and  properly  graded,  and  skills
requirements for trainers have been introduced.

In  terms  of  vehicle  fitness,  a  major  concern  is  the  allegation  of
corruption  taking  place  at  some  vehicle  testing  stations  where  some
unroadworthy vehicles are passed in exchange for money. Investigations  have
been  undertaken  into  these  vehicle  testing  stations  to  assess  their
compliance with statutory requirements and to root out corruption.

The Road to Safety strategy builds on this and other initiatives. I have  no
doubt that this strategy will ensure the  long-term  sustainability  of  our
whole road safety initiative.

hon the Minister: Forward with the  Arrive  Alive  campaign  and  also  your
campaign on safety.]

Debate concluded.

                      TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF  COMMUNICATIONS:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  comrades  and
friends, after having participated in some of  the  discussion  sessions  at
ITU Telecoms 2001, which is being held  in  Johannesburg  this  week,  I  am
convinced that in South Africa the  fruits  of  more  than  nine  months  of
intense consultations with stakeholders are beginning to ripen.

Our country remains on  the  right  path  regarding  the  direction  of  the
telecommunications sector.  We  stand  at  the  threshold  of  delivering  a
telecommunications  law  that  will  make  a  difference  in  the  lives  of
millions. Whether we are rich or poor, the scourge of poverty  is  with  us.
Our people are yearning for telecommunications legislation that can help  to
address this scourge.

They expect of all of us, the executive, the legislatures and  the  industry
players, to deliver a sector that will not  just  be  about  technology  but
will contribute to the reconstruction and development of society,  a  sector
that addresses the needs of the majority of our people.

Today I stand before this House to highlight some of the  issues  that  will
enable us to bridge the digital divide  that  will  enhance  local  economic
development, promote economic empowerment and provide  safety  and  security
for all.
The importance of this Bill  for  provinces  is  often  underestimated.  The
issue of the roll-out of infrastructure is pertinent  to  the  economies  of
provinces. This roll-out means jobs and increased access.  Universal  access
means access to tools, particularly  information  and  communications  tools
for the development of communities.

Experience has shown that big companies do not always service the lower  end
of the market, if at all. Experience has shown  that  restructuring  without
creating  competition  often  leads  to  substituting  public  monopoly  for
private monopoly. By introducing small, medium  and  micro  enterprises,  we
have tried to handle this contradiction.

The Bill provides  for  the  licensing  of  small  and  medium  enterprises,
including co-operatives in areas where the teledensity is less than 5%.  The
more successful these groups become, the more competition will exist in  the
sector, and this will therefore lead to the lowering of tariffs.

SMMEs licensed in  these  areas  will  be  allowed  to  provide  Voice  over
Internet Protocol, fixed,  mobile  and  public  pay  telephones.  This  will
ensure that  rural  areas  and  marginalised  small  towns  are  effectively
brought into the new economy. Priority  will  be  given  to  the  small  and
medium enterprises which are owned by women, youth and the disabled and  are
controlled and managed by them. The focus will particularly  be  on  blacks.
Some of the funding  for  this  initiative  will  come  from  the  Universal
Service Fund, which has been increased to 0,5% of all operator turnover.

This Bill allows for public  emergency  communications  which  will  be  re-
engineered to offer  compatible  and  nationally  accessible  services.  The
importance of this for local government cannot be underestimated.  A  single
emergency number, 112, has been allocated. This  number  will  be  available
free of charge and will override any other call. Young and old, literate  or
illiterate, rural  or  urban,  will  be  able  to  easily  access  emergency
services. Provincial and local governments are urged to work with us in  the
expansion of this service.
Provision has been made for the creation  of  a  private  telecommunications
network for public schools and further education and training  institutions.
The network will ensure that public schools have access to the Internet.  To
facilitate this, public schools will  be  entitled  to  a  50%  discount  on
Internet connection. We  ask  provinces  to  ensure  that  school  governing
bodies, school administrators and teachers champion access to this network.

The Bill also allows for the empowerment of the disadvantaged. According  to
the Bill,  up  to  30%  of  all  major  operators  will  be  set  aside  for
empowerment purposes. This  will  benefit  blacks,  women  and  people  with
disabilities. The provincial and national  social  and  business  structures
and their leadership, for example societies, stokvels,  women's  groups  and
professional associations, must create for themselves vehicles so that  they
can participate in the empowerment process.

With regard to the outstanding amendments, this  House  has  been  presented
with the following considerations: the introduction of carrier  preselection
at the end of 2003 and  number  portability  in  2005.  Both  of  these  are
competition enablers.

This House has also been given  the  task  to  look  at  the  definition  of
``fixed-mobile''. The definition of ``fixed-mobile'' has  been  reworked  to
clarify that fixed-mobile is not the same as mobile  licences.  Through  the
work that  members  of  this  House  have  done,  they  can  bear  testimony
themselves to the fact that our country is heading  for  a  big  information
revolution.

But this revolution could be stillborn unless we support the  regulator  and
defend its integrity. I have no doubt that through unity in action, we  will
succeed.

I particularly wish to thank the  members  of  this  House  and  the  select
committee under the leadership of Mr  Fenyane  who  spent  days  and  nights
unravelling the complexities of this  Bill  for  management  liberalisation,
managing  the  competing  interests  which  were   very   heavily   invested
interests. It was no easy task.

I am particularly grateful  for  their  sensitivity  and  their  concern  to
ensure that there is co-operation with the executive. This co-operation  did
not compromise their independence from the executive but rather allowed  the
final product to be in  the  best  interests  of  all  and  particularly  to
contribute to a better life for all in our country.

I therefore would like to invite members to adopt the  Bill,  including  the
suggested amendments. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP:  Hon  members,  before  we  proceed  with  the
debate, I just want to draw members' attention  to  the  fact  that  I  have
requested a photographer to take a photograph of this  sitting.  The  reason
for that, and for allowing a stranger on the floor of  the  House,  is  that
this Chamber as it looks this week will be very  altered  by  February  next
year when we reconvene. Therefore we thought it important to have  a  record
of ourselves and this Chamber in this year at this time. Hence the  presence
of the person just now.

If I could ask members to desist from moving in and out  so  that  we  could
indeed have the photograph taken and conclude the matter.

Mr S L E FENYANE: Chairperson, let me at the outset indicate  that  research
in the telecommunications industry  projects  that  Africa  will  experience
phenomenal growth in this  industry  despite  apparent  downturns  on  other
continents. The research company DMI Knowledge projects an annual growth  of
33% for the mobile market and 25% for the land line or  fixed  line  market.
It is predicted that in the next five  years,  between  R6  billion  and  R8
billion will be poured into the continent of Africa in this industry.

These developments paint a rosy  scenario  for  Africa  and  compel  one  to
acknowledge that immense opportunities beckon for  job  creation  and  rapid
economic growth. Let me hasten to inform  members  that  in  our  exultation
about the probable benefits that might accrue in our favour, we  should  not
lose sight of the fact that in this industry the only thing that is  certain
is uncertainty, precisely because communications as an industry  is  at  the
core of capitalism in the new world order.

The Bill in front of us has  been  drafted  in  sync  with  these  projected
developments, mindful  of  the  fact  that  the  industry  is  fraught  with
volatility that is punctuated with a profusion  of  twists  and  turns.  The
Bill addresses managed liberalisation of the telecommunications industry  by
introducing a competitor to Telkom in the year 2002. Consumers  will  decide
either to use Telkom or the second  national  operator.  It  is  hoped  that
competition will reduce the price of telephony drastically.  Hope,  however,
should not be confused with reality.

According to the IDG report, only 4 million people in Africa have access  to
the Internet, and about 2,5 million of  these  people  are  found  in  South
Africa alone. In order to enhance Internet usage the  Bill  makes  provision
that would allow public schools a  50%  discount  on  calls  to  access  the
Internet. Our children would then be afforded the opportunity  to  surf  the
Internet for their homework and assignments.

In order to address the  plight  of  women  and  historically  disadvantaged
persons, the Bill makes provision for the regulator, Icasa, to  give  regard
to licence applications which include women as equity  shareholders  -  that
is, key features  in  major  applications  for  telecommunications  licences
should be a 30% set-aside equity shareholding for persons from  historically
disadvantaged groupings and the presence  of  women's  groupings  as  equity
shareholders.

The Bill makes provision for the use of the Universal Service Fund  to  help
SMMEs in the provision of telecommunications infrastructure and services  in
designated underserviced areas where teledensity is currently below 5%.  The
department is painfully aware that SMMEs are not able to access  funds  from
commercial banks in South Africa as a result of the surreptitious  redlining
of certain areas by these commercial banks.
During the drive for the African Rennaissance it has  been  discovered  that
African countries are currently not able to speak with one  another  without
the use of a middle person who resides outside of  Africa.  The  Bill  makes
provision for Sentech to play a pivotal role  in  the  rerouting  of  inter-
Africa telecommunications traffic so that when one country in  Africa  talks
to another in Africa, it should do so through a facility  that  is  situated
in Africa.

Sentech currently has the capacity to carry this traffic  from  one  country
to another in Africa. It also has the capacity to carry this traffic  beyond
the borders of  South  Africa.  In  line  with  international  developments,
Sentech will also be granted a licence to provide  multimedia  services  for
the  promotion  of  conversions  of  telecommunications,  broadcasting   and
information technology.

Allow me to share with members the following observation that  has  inspired
me immensely. It is said that there exists  in  the  Namib  Desert  a  plant
called Welwitschia mirabilis, which has miraculously withstood the  harshest
conditions known to mankind. This plant survives by harvesting  moisture  in
the air that it captures in its leaves. It then  shares  the  moisture  with
the few animals that chew  on  its  leaves  for  their  survival.  As  these
animals chew its leaves, they strengthen the Welwitschia  plant  and  afford
it the power to overcome illness. Other desert animals use  this  plant  for
shade and during their visitation they respond to the call  of  nature  next
to the plant, thus fertilising the base of that plant to keep it  nourished.


They  do  other  ill-defined  things  there,  and  the  plant  gets  further
fertilised  in  the  process.  This  plant   symbolically   indicates   that
surviving, even in the desert, is possible if those who are condemned to  be
there by fate collaborate, co-operate and share for their  mutual  survival.
It symbolically indicates that  there  is  hope  in  hopelessness,  help  in
helplessness and strength in weakness.

In the same vein we say South Africa will help Africa. In the process  South
Africa itself will be  helped.  We  ask  politely  that  Sentech  should  be
allowed to interconnect Africa so that when Judgment Day dawns we should  be
able to answer the Almighty and say in unison:  Father,  we  have  liberated
Africa from the morass of ignorance and want.

Mok Onitsha of Nigeria said:


  I have been flayed, slaved, scoffed, jailed,
  Eating in chains, bludgeoned before maids;
  I've fought in others' armies, been hailed,
  Feasted with gods, oh, and sung with birds


  Hero, beggar, fool, I've all by turns,
  Known dietetic sweetness and mental treason;
  Cold heart, hot temper, each in me burns,
  Stubborn with power, beauty in all season.

This should be history when we talk  about  Africa,  particularly  regarding
matters of economic growth  and  telecommunications  development.  What  the
Bill is attempting to do through Sentech is  to  introduce  the  concept  of
handicapping in telecommunications.  Those  who  play  or  follow  golf  are
familiar with this concept of handicapping. It is a  theory  that  seeks  to
level the golfing playing fields  so  as  to  allow  the  less  accomplished
competitor the opportunity to take part and stand a chance  of  winning  the
competition.

Indeed, our survival will be sustained if we can  enhance  the  survival  of
others around us. We can make it if we try. I move that we support the  Bill
and thereby rewrite and redefine the  telecommunications  history  of  South
Africa. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: We hope you are also going  to  be  poetic,  Dr
Nel. [Laughter.]

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, hierdie baie belangrike stuk wetgewing kom oor  'n
lang pad vol slaggate, amper so erg soos in die Vrystaat, en hy het ook  erg
wipplank gery. Gedurende die  hantering  van  die  wet  in  die  portefeulje
komitee was daar 'n ongekende aantal  instellings  wat  voorleggings  gemaak
het waarvan die dokumentasie, volgens een van die sprekers in die  Nasionale
Vergadering, bykans 70 kilogram geweeg het. Dit  is  ook  geen  wonder  nie,
want hierdie wetsontwerp hanteer die voortbestaan en  die  rigting  van  die
pad vorentoe van 'n multimiljardrandbedryf  wat  'n  baie  belangrike  diens
lewer waarin miljarde rande van buitelandse belegging betrokke is.

Daar was selfs ook 'n verteenwoordiger van die Amerikaanse  handelsinstituut
wat insette gelewer het.

Hewige  debatte  is  gevoer  en  vyf-voor-middernagwysigings   is   in   die
wetsontwerp aangebring. Daar is nie minder nie as 13  bladsye  wysigings  in
die portefeuljekomitee en twee bladsye in  die  gekose  komitee  goedgekeur.
Baie belangrike veranderings is op die nippertjie aangebring.

My party steun ook graag die wysiging wat daarvoor voorsiening maak dat  dit
nie vir die tweede nasionale operateur nodig sal wees  om  die  laaste  deel
van telefoonlyne na wonings self aan te lê en te  betaal  nie.  Dit  beteken
dat die tweede  operateur  meer  mededingend  sal  kan  wees,  wat  net  tot
voordeel van die gemeenskap kan wees, ook  vir  dié  wat  nie  voorheen  die
voorreg gehad het om 'n telefoon in hulle huise te kan hê nie.

Ons steun ook die wysiging wat die definisie van die sogenaamde  vasgestelde
selfoonlisensie só verander het dat die operateur  van  hierdie  nuwe  soort
diens nie meer as die trefmyle van een selfoonmas mag  gebruik  nie  en  ook
nie toegelaat sal word om oor te skakel van die een mas  na  'n  ander  nie.
Dit behoort die selfoonoperateurs baie gelukkig en die klimaat meer  gunstig
te maak vir buitelandse beleggings, wat broodnodig is  vir  die  suksesvolle
instelling van die tweede operateur.

Ten spyte van dit alles  is  my  party  van  mening  dat  Telkom  steeds  'n
monopolie oor sekere dienste  het  wat  die  "Value-added  Network  Service"
insluit. Ons het die gevoel in die gekose komitee gekry  dat  Telkom  steeds
bevoordeel word. Telkom is wel toegelaat om 'n  mondelinge  voorlegging  aan
die gekose komitee te doen, maar  Icasa  en  Sentech  is  op  grond  van  'n
tegniese  punt  verbied  om  voorleggings  te  doen.  In   die   skriftelike
voorlegging wat Icasa wel aan die komitee gedoen het, was  aanbevelings  wat
sinvol was, maar hulle is geïgnoreer. Ek voel dat hulle saak aangehoor  moes
wees.

Ek voel ook steeds sterk daaroor dat te  veel  mag  in  die  hande  van  die
Minister setel ten opsigte van die toekenning van die  nodige  lisensies  en
te min mag in die Onafhanklike  Kommunikasie-owerheid  van  SA,  Icasa,  wat
kragtens die Grondwet as reguleerder moet optree. My persoonlike  gevoel  is
dat daar nog vele hofsake kan volg. Om dié redes sien die  Nuwe  NP  nie  sy
weg oop om die wetsontwerp in sy huidige vorm te steun nie. (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, this very important  piece  of  legislation  has
come a long way, over a road full of potholes, almost as  bad  as  those  in
the Free State, and it also seesawed quite badly. When the  legislation  was
dealt with the Act in the portfolio committee  an  unprecedented  number  of
institutions  made  submissions,  and  the  documentation  in  this  regard,
according  to  one  of  the  speakers  in  the  National  Assembly,  weighed
approximately 70 kg. No wonder, because this Bill deals with  the  continued
existence and the direction of  the  way  forward  of  a  multibillion  rand
industry that delivers a very important service in which billions  of  rands
in foreign investments are involved.

There was even a representative from the American commercial  institute  who
made submissions. Heated debates took place and last minute amendments  were
made to the Bill. No fewer than 13 pages of amendments were approved in  the
portfolio committee and two pages in the select  committee.  Very  important
changes were made at the very last minute.

My party would also like to support the  amendment  that  provides  that  it
will not be necessary for the second  national  operator  to  lay  the  last
portion of telephone lines at residences and to pay for  this  itself.  This
means that the second operator can be more competitive, which will  only  be
to the benefit of the community, including  those  who  did  not  previously
have the privilege of having a telephone in their homes.

We also support the amendment that changes the definition of  the  so-called
`` fixed cellphone licence'' to such an extent that  the  operator  of  this
new sort of service may not use more than the range of  one  cellphone  mast
and will also not be allowed to  change  from  one  mast  to  another.  This
should make the cellphone operators very happy and  the  climate  should  be
more conducive to foreign investment, which is extremely necessary  for  the
successful establishment of the second operator.

Notwithstanding all of this my party is of the  opinion  that  Telkom  still
has a monopoly on certain services which include the  ``Value-added  Network
Service''. We got the impression from the select committee that  Telkom  was
still being  favoured.  Telkom  was,  in  fact,  allowed  to  make  an  oral
presentation to the select committee, but Icasa and Sentech were  prohibited
from making presentations on the  grounds  of  a  technical  point.  In  the
written submission which  Icasa  did  make  to  the  committee,  there  were
recommendations that were meaningful but they  were  ignored.  I  feel  that
their case should have been heard.

I also still feel strongly that there is too much power in the hands of  the
Minister with regard to the awarding of the necessary licences and that  too
little power is vested in the Independent Communications  Authority  of  SA,
Icasa, which, according to the  Constitution,  must  act  as  regulator.  My
personal feeling is that many court cases could ensue. Due to these  reasons
the New NP does not see its way clear to supporting the Bill in its  current
form.]

Ms C S BOTHA: Chairperson, I am reading this on behalf of Mr Lever.

Telecommunications has always played an important role in our economy.  With
the advent of the digital age and what has become known as ``convergence  of
technologies'', telecommunications has taken on a  new  significance  as  an
engine of economic initiative and growth.

If  we,  as  an  economy,  wish  to  draw  the  maximum  benefit  from   the
opportunities  that  the  technology  developments  have   to   offer,   the
regulatory environment must be appropriate to attract and allow  investment,
development, innovation and growth in the industry. The amendments  in  this
Bill and the policies they give effect to have to be measured against  these
aspirations.

The extent of lobbying that took place in regard to this Bill is  indicative
of the fact that the stakes are extremely high. Lobbying  took  place  right
up to the very last minute. No doubt the  lobbying  will  continue,  as  the
amendments that the select committee proposed and passed  will  be  referred
back to the portfolio committee for its consideration.

A disturbing feature of the process in the select committee is that  one  of
the major stakeholders, and this has been referred to by  Dr  Nel  as  well,
namely  Telkom,  was  allowed  an  opportunity  to  make  oral  and  written
representations  to  the  select  committee.  Other  stakeholders  were  not
invited to do the same. In fact, when other stakeholders requested the  same
opportunity, it was denied. These other stakeholders were  invited  to  make
written representations instead, and they were confined  to  making  written
representations only, and there was talk of confining representation to  the
proposed amendments  only.  I  wish  to  bring  this  to  hon  Mr  Fenyane's
attention.

There are a number of important principles that have to be brought out  into
the open and emphasised.  Firstly,  every  stakeholder  is  entitled  to  be
treated equally by the committees. This is a right, it is not  a  privilege.
Secondly, the select committee is an independent body, which is  obliged  to
apply its mind to the legislation in its  entirety.  Consequently,  although
it is within the purview of the committee to regulate the evidence which  it
is  prepared  to  hear,  it  should  be  slow  to  confine  stakeholders  to
particular topics, and it should never  treat  stakeholders  in  an  unequal
manner.
Turning to the Bill itself, licences in the telecommunications industry  are
meant to be issued by the independent  regulator.  This  Bill  bypasses  the
independent regulator and grants Sentech a licence by  statute.  It  further
guarantees Eskom and Transnet an equity interest in the  second  fixed  line
operator. While there may be synergies, benefits  and  potential  to  unlock
value in Transnet and Eskom by involving  them  in  the  second  fixed  line
operator, it would be healthier to amend their statutes,  if  necessary,  to
allow them to form a consortium with each other or  other  parties,  and  to
apply for a licence from the independent regulator. This is, after all,  why
we have set up an independent regulator.

The Bill introduces a concept called the fixed mobile service, and I do  not
know why they did not come up with a better  name  for  that  service.  This
initially created a lot of uncertainty over its intended purpose.  It  seems
that, originally, it might  have  been  intended  to  give  public  switched
telecommunication services the  right  to  obtain  mini  regional  cellphone
services. In its present form, the definition would appear to prohibit  this
- a change we support. It seems that a fancy term has been coined simply  to
describe a wireless local loop, which does not make it  any  clearer  to  me
either.

The select committee has approved a new clause requiring  the  regulator  to
set a framework for number portability and caller preselection.  We  support
these mechanisms which encourage consumer choice  and  competition,  but  we
express here, as we did in the committee, the view that the introduction  of
carrier selection in December 2003 is very late in the day  for  the  second
national operator. The  second  national  operator  will  have  the  use  of
Telkom's facilities as of right only until May 2004. Four or five months  of
carrier select or carrier preselection is a very short period  in  which  to
establish its consumer base. It is true that  the  second  national  carrier
can enter into agreements with Telkom to lease facilities  after  May  2004,
but, judged on past performance,  our  concern  is  that  Telkom  may  block
access or make it difficult.
The Bill does not properly meet  the  demands  of  true  liberalisation.  In
addition, it usurps important functions of  the  independent  regulator,  in
that it awards Sentech a licence and it also allocates equity in the  second
fixed line operator's licence to two state-owned entities, and it  allocates
radio frequency spectrum.

For these reasons, the DP opposes the Bill. [Applause]

Mr M J BHENGU: Madam Chairperson, I want to say that this Bill has  not  had
an easy passage through both Houses because of the 14  pages  of  amendments
in the National Assembly.  Now  further  critical  additions  were  actually
inserted by the NCOP and that attests to this fact.

I wish to congratulate the hon the Minister and the hon chairperson  of  our
select committee for the way they have handled such a  difficult  Bill.  The
IFP finds itself very much able to support this Bill,  because  these  last-
minute amendments which  have  been  effected  by  the  NCOP  have  actually
convinced us to see to it that we have to support it.

Carrier preselection  and  number  portability  are  essential  enablers  of
competition, and the time has come for Telkom's monopoly to come to an  end.
This House today is actually making this possible. For  the  IFP,  democracy
means the freedom for one to choose those who govern one. In the context  of
today's debate we believe that the  very  same  democracy  must  also  allow
South African consumers to choose.  There  are  service  providers  who  are
doing just that and this Bill is making one choose a reality in  enabling  a
second national operator in competition to Telkom, and  introducing  Cell  C
in competition to Vodacom and MTN.

Value is also being added to our signal distributor,  Sentech,  and  it  too
has  been  enabled  to  offer  competition  by  way  of  its   international
telecommunications gateway. At long last the value-added network service  or
Vans providers have also been given some  respite  from  the  iron  grip  of
Telkom, in that they have finally actually been more accurately defined.

We hope this  will  go  a  long  way  towards  dissolving  the  ongoing  and
acrimonious litigation between themselves and Telkom. It  will  also  enable
the Vans industry to more readily offer its customers  more  choice  in  the
way of new and innovative services. We  have  reservations  with  regard  to
many of the complex matters this Bill has attempted to address  relating  to
both telecommunications and broadcasting. We  all  know  that  a  multimedia
service is actually a broadcasting  service  and  the  definition  has  been
changed  from  a  digital  broadcasting  service  to  a   telecommunications
service.

But we need new and innovative policy  and  legislation  that  appropriately
deals  with  the  worldwide  rapid  convergence  of  telecommunications  and
broadcasting. This will not be easy because  in  South  Africa,  as  we  all
know,  the  issue  of  broadcasting  occupies  a  special   place   in   our
Constitution and must be regulated by an independent authority, which is  at
present the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa or Icasa.

The  multibillion  telecommunications  and  broadcasting  sectors  are   all
shouting with one voice that Icasa lacks  capacity  and  resources,  and  is
unable to  fulfil  its  statutory  mandates  and  is  subject  to  executive
interference. This has been amply demonstrated by the ongoing  pantomime  of
its  regulations  and  recommendations  being  routinely  scuppered   and/or
ignored by the department.

Most of its proposals regarding this very Bill are a case in point  and  for
confirmation I recommend a comparison between  Icasa's  submission  and  the
now hopefully final draft of the Bill. Icasa is therefore  unable  to  offer
stability and certainty to these interlinking industries and this must  also
be addressed as a matter of urgency.

Investors will tell us that they are nervous. [Time expired.]
Mr Z S  KOLWENI:  Chairperson,  policies  reflected  in  this  Bill  include
preferential procurement policy with a specific focus. Preference of  up  to
30% of the equity is held by persons in  historically  disadvantaged  groups
including  women.  This  30%  may  be   given   for   ownership   in   major
telecommunication licences. Giving preference to historically  disadvantaged
persons is a milestone and is encouraging.

SMMEs, including  co-operatives,  will  be  granted  a  licence  to  provide
telecommunications services, including ``Voice over Internet  Protocol''  in
areas with a teledensity of up to 5%.

In pursuing this dream the Department of Communications will have to  ensure
that the rural SMMEs benefit from  this  and  mechanisms  are  in  place  to
ensure the dissemination of information to these people  so  that  they  can
fully exploit this opportunity.
Sentech will be licensed to provide international gateway communication  and
multimedia services. For these purposes, Sentech will operate as  a  carrier
of  carriers  and  will  not  provide  international  services  directly  to
consumers  or  end-users.  Like  other  licensees,  Sentech  will  be  given
universal service obligations.

Public  emergency  centres  will  be  established  and  operated  through  a
nationwide accessible public emergency number, namely 112, free  of  charge.
All public  schools  will  be  entitled  to  a  50%  discount  for  Internet
connections. A private network will be established to link  public  schools.
This is encouraging. However,  schools  in  the  rural  areas  will  not  be
benefiting from this, as they do not have access to the Internet.

A private network will also be established to provide maritime services  for
the safety of life at sea. There will be no broadband  licensing.  Broadband
services  will  be  available  through   the   licensed   telecommunications
companies. Carrier preselection and number portability will begin  in  2005.
There will be no restriction on foreign ownership.

In conclusion, the policy directions  of  the  Bill  are  very  progressive.
However, they are meant  for  a  First  World  economy.  The  South  African
economy has a rural sector that still needs to  be  developed  in  terms  of
telecommunications. As long as this sector is still underdeveloped, it  will
enjoy minimal benefits out of this process.

Whilst this Bill is in line with the preferential procurement policy of  the
Government, there are still unresolved issues of fronting that need  special
attention.

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  thank  the
members for the support of this Bill. It is quite clear that  they  did  not
sit at the meetings but actually followed what was happening and  understood
the responsibility that has been placed  upon  all  of  us,  especially  the
responsibility  that  is  placed  on  the  Minister,  who  takes  the  final
responsibility. The Minister therefore cannot allow  that  havoc  occurs  in
the sector.

We all know that in this world, especially these days,  we  do  not  have  a
perfect market. The market is very  imperfect.  Many  people  say  that  the
market should decide. They are assuming that there is a perfect  market  out
there and there is not such a thing. Clearly, during this ITU conference  it
has constantly been told to us that the market is  not  perfect.  There  are
circumstances under which it may be perfect.

I have had discussions with people from different parts of  Europe.  Germany
took 15 years to get a regulatory framework in place. We  had  a  few  years
with people that did not have  the  same  kind  of  experience.  It  is  the
responsibility of all of us, including  the  Minister,  that  we  support  a
regulator and give such a regulator integrity. Nothing that  we  do  as  the
legislature, as the executive, even as Icasa itself, will  give  Icasa  that
integrity, unless we also have the support of the media. The  media  did  in
fact undermine its integrity. We need to  be  able  to  separate  fact  from
fiction, and not in fact exacerbate what  may  be  discussions  between  the
Minister and Icasa as a contestation for power. Such contestation  does  not
exist.

A regulator is indeed important,  particularly  a  credible  regulator.  But
that regulator  follows  policies.  It  is  important  that  the  discussion
between the executive and the regulator takes place in order  to  make  sure
that what the regulator does regulate is in synchronicity with the  policies
that have been out there.

Currently, no country, including the countries that we  referred  to  -  the
USA, etc - has been able to have a regulatory  environment  that  one  could
say is completely stable and in which nothing happens. If  we  look  at  the
litigation in the United States' courts at the moment,  and  throughout  the
world, especially after 11 September, the state  of  the  telecommunications
industry is in flux. This is important, and I think  we  are  being  praised
for having gone the way we have.

I spoke with many people from Russia yesterday. Since  the  changeover  from
the old system to the new, Russia still has not  had  a  regulatory  system,
and they are looking to us for guidance. I hope we will not  be  pessimistic
about ourselves and the directions that we have taken,  for  example  around
the issue of Sentech.

The Sentech direction that we have taken is not  unique.  If  one  looks  at
European countries, similar directions have been taken. Therefore,  I  think
what we did was to make sure that we are able  to  manage  the  changes,  to
look at what the future might  hold.   As  the  chairperson  of  the  select
committee  has  said,  we  do  also  have  responsibilities,  not  only  for
ourselves but also for the development of this continent in  terms  of  what
we have called our African Renaissance and the renewal of Africa.

We will do everything in our power to empower everyone who must  participate
in the sector. We hope that with your help as members  of  this  House,  who
will also be very close to the ground to see where problems may arise,  that
we will rise to the occasion and make sure that any problems are  taken  out
of the way, including  difficulties  that  may  exist  with  regard  to  the
regulator.

Dr Nel has mentioned the fact that ...

... dit was 'n lang pad. Dit was 'n pad vol slaggate. [...  it  was  a  long
road. It was a road full of potholes.]

He is right about that, and he is also right  about  the  vested  interests.
There was 70kg of paper that this committee had to go through, because  this
is an industry in which the interests amount to many billions  of  rand.  We
are small fry in it. The important task for this Government is to make  sure
that the small fry that are in  it,  as  we  are  in  South  Africa,  defend
particularly the rights of the consumers,  especially  those  at  the  lower
end, not those at the higher end.

Therefore, we needed to walk this path. I appreciate the  support  for  this
Bill, and wish to say for those that had concerns about the second  national
operator and the usurpation of the powers of the regulator,  that  that  was
not the intention and it shall not be the  intention,  because  we  need  an
independent regulator. We also want to  understand  what  we  mean  by  that
regulator.

For  me  it  is  the  integrity  of  that  regulator  that  is  particularly
important. It is not only important for South Africa, it  is  important  for
the region, the  continent  and  the  world.  I  thank  members  for  having
supported this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

                   PROVINCIAL TAX REGULATION PROCESS BILL

     (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Finance
                                  thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Chair,  hon  members,  the  Provincial
Tax Regulation Process Bill empowers provinces  to  take  another  important
step forward in exercising their constitutional powers and gives  effect  to
the vision of a unitary, but fiscally decentralised  system  of  Government.
The Bill is required not only for  constitutional  reasons,  but  for  sound
fiscal and governance reasons.

I would like to begin with the constitutional  and  legal  aspects,  and  in
this regard retrace our  steps  a  little  bit.  About  five  years  ago  we
gathered  in   the   Constitutional   Assembly   as   the   freely   elected
representatives of our people to work out  the  scheme  of  government  best
suited to the people of our democratic Republic.

Conscious of the divisions,  inequalities  and  unfair  discrimination  from
which we emerged, we  adopted,  as  the  supreme  law  of  our  Republic,  a
Constitution, so as to, amongst other things, build a united and  democratic
South Africa able to take its rightful place as a  sovereign  state  in  the
family of nations.

We devised for this single  sovereign  and  democratic  state  a  government
constituted as national, provincial and local spheres of  government,  which
are distinctive,  interdependent  and  interrelated.  To  ensure  that  this
distinctiveness, interdependence and interrelation could,  in  practice,  be
real we set out principles of co-operative government and  intergovernmental
relations, with which each of these spheres and organs of state within  them
would have to function.

These principles of co-operative government and intergovernmental  relations
require that each sphere of government and its organs of state  respect  the
constitutional status, institutions, powers and functions of  government  in
the other spheres; not assume any power or function except  those  conferred
on them in terms of the Constitution;  exercise  their  powers  and  perform
their functions in a manner that does  not  encroach  on  the  geographical,
functional or institutional integrity of government in another  sphere;  and
co-operate with one another in mutual trust and good faith by,  among  other
things, fostering friendly relations and  co-ordinating  their  actions  and
legislation with one another.

In giving effect to this vision, Chapter 13  of  the  Constitution  required
national Government to table and pass several pieces  of  legislation.  Much
of this has been achieved, as demonstrated by the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal
Relations Act of 1997, the Financial and Fiscal Commission Act of 1997,  the
Public Finance Management Act of 1999, the Borrowing  Powers  of  Provincial
Government Act of 1996, and four division of revenue Acts.

This  Bill  is  the  last  piece  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  legislation
applying to provinces and required by the Constitution.

Through the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Relations  Act,  the  nine  MECs  of
Finance and the Minister of Finance have developed a great  team  spirit  as
they seek to translate these fine constitutional principles  into  practice.
The Budget Council, which will be meeting in this city two  days  from  now,
indeed promotes and facilitates intergovernmental relations in a manner  few
ever contemplated. On the constitutional and legal front, we have  completed
all the enabling legislation necessary  to  support  our  provincial  fiscal
framework.

Now I would like to point out the fiscal  and  economic  rationale  for  the
Provincial  Tax  Regulation  Process  Bill.  The  economic   arguments   for
devolving some taxation powers  to  subnational  governments  are  generally
accepted in highly developed countries. They  revolve  around  the  need  to
promote fiscal accountability of governments to their electorate.

The theory that supports decentralisation of taxation authority is the  idea
that revenue sources match expenditure responsibilities. Although  there  is
consensus on this guiding principle, this  seldom  occurs  in  practice  and
taxation powers vary widely. For example, ratios of  own  revenue  to  total
revenues range from around 4% in Italy to 80% in  the  USA  and  Canada.  To
bridge their remaining imbalances, most countries combine authority for  own
revenue sources with transfers from  the  national  government.  Though  the
conventional arguments may apply less in a  developing  country,  and  other
factors such as redistribution between and within provinces  must  be  taken
into account, the economic arguments also apply if only on the margin.

In South Africa, given our revenue-sharing model, we are at  the  lower  end
with regard to provincial taxation powers.  Our  provincial  total  revenues
this year are budgeted at about R121 billion, with  less  than  4%  of  that
total coming from own revenues, in other words, from revenue raised  in  the
province:  mainly  motor  vehicle  licences,  hospital  fees  and   gambling
proceeds. For as long as this fiscal capacity remains so low, our system  of
government is open to moral hazard or the risk of rewarding those  provinces
that manage their finances poorly.

Before focusing on our approach to provincial taxation, we  must  take  into
account other fiscal arrangements, particularly  those  related  to  grants.
The system of equitable share and conditional grants was  first  implemented
in 1998 after considering the 1996 and  1997  recommendations  of  the  FFC.
This system is both transparent  and  fair.  Further,  provinces  have  also
developed their capacity to manage and spend these funds  in  a  responsible
manner, proving that they are now ready to exercise  their  taxation  powers
more effectively.

The FFC first raised the issue of provincial taxes in reports  of  1996  and
1997. Thereafter, at the request of the budget council, the Katz  commission
investigated provincial tax options. However, considering that South  Africa
has a unitary rather than a federal  system  and  given  the  phase  of  our
evolution as a Government, the commission recommended caution  in  assigning
significant  revenue  sources  to  provinces.  Devolved  taxes  will   allow
provincial governments to differentiate the  level  of  services  that  they
offer and be held accountable for the overall level of  expenditure  instead
of only for the efficient allocation of a fixed total.

The taxation powers of provinces also  take  into  account  that  developing
countries such as  South  Africa  operate  in  a  global  environment  where
macroeconomic targets such as tax-to-GDP ratio matter.  The  whole  approach
to taxation that we are adopting ensures  that  we  do  not  compromise  our
capacity for macroeconomic or fiscal management.

Coming to the Bill itself, it is  a  cautious  step  in  the  assignment  of
revenue  sources  to  provinces.  The  executive  representatives   of   the
different provinces who sit on the  Budget  Council  have  subjected  it  to
scrutiny and debate. We are most indebted to them. They  have  ensured  that
this Bill, in its part fulfilment of the requirements of  section  228(2)(b)
of the Constitution, advances co-operative government. As  set  out  in  the
long title of the Bill, its purpose  is  to  regulate  an  intergovernmental
process that must be followed by provinces in the exercise  of  their  power
in terms of section 228 of the  Constitution  -  to  impose  taxes,  levies,
duties and flat rate surcharges on the tax basis of any tax,  levy  or  duty
imposed by national  legislation,  and  to  provide  for  matters  that  are
related to that.

The Bill provides  for  a  process  that  is  driven  and  directed  by  two
fundamental principles: firstly, that  the  provinces'  power  to  impose  a
provincial  tax  must  not  be  exercised  in  a  way  that  materially  and
unreasonably  prejudices  (a)  national  economic  policies,  (b)   economic
activities across provincial boundaries and (c)  the  national  mobility  of
goods, services, capital  or  labour,  and  secondly,  compliance  with  the
principles  of  co-operative  government  set  out  in  Chapter  3  of   the
Constitution which we have  referred  to  above.  These  are  the  two  main
principles that underpin this particular Bill.

The process set out in the Bill is itself aimed at  assisting  provinces  to
ensure that their taxation powers are exercised within  the  limits  of  the
Constitution. It provides, in the event of a dispute between a province  and
national Government about compliance with constitutional  requirements,  for
referral to  the  Constitutional  Court  for  its  determination  whether  a
proposed tax is constitutional. As earlier  indicated,  the  Bill  partially
fulfils the requirements  of  section  228(2)(b)  of  the  Constitution.  To
ensure compliance with the requirements of  this  section,  it  contemplates
that Parliament should enact further legislation.

This further legislation will be in respect of  a  provincial  tax  proposal
that does  not  materially  and  unreasonably  prejudice  national  economic
policies,  which  includes  the  tax  policy  for  the  Republic.   Economic
activities across provincial boundaries and the national mobility of  goods,
services, capital or labour determine, among other things, the tax  base  on
which such provincial tax may be  levied,  the  rate  band  within  which  a
province may impose such provincial tax and the collecting  agent  for  such
provincial tax if it is not going to be the SA Revenue Service.

This two-phase regulatory process takes into account the dual  qualification
provided to the specific and  guaranteed  taxing  power  of  the  provinces,
namely that,  one,  the  provincial  taxing  power  not  prejudice  national
economic policies and related matters and, two, the provincial taxing  power
must be regulated by an Act of Parliament.
The thrust of section 228 of the  Constitution  is  accordingly  simple.  It
vests a circumscribed taxing  power  in  provinces.  The  exercise  of  such
power, however, may not be used to trample upon national economic  policies.
Such exercise must also be regulated by an Act of Parliament.

The Bill's approach is practical and constitutional. It accepts the  reality
that, given that there will, in many instances, be major  variances  between
taxes  or  categories  of  taxes,  we  could  not,  as   crafters   of   the
Constitution, have  conceivably  contemplated  that  when  it  came  to  the
regulation of varying taxes we would have been so naive as to  believe  that
one size fits all.

The Bill also takes into account that those who are paid by the word,  twice
for a verb, that is my learned friends  the  lawyers,  have  been  quick  to
remind  us  that  the  Constitutional  Court,   when   giving   a   positive
certification to what we had crafted on  the  provinces'  taxing  powers  in
1996,  held  that  the  term  ``regulate''  in  section  228(2)(b)  of   the
Constitution connotes a broad managing or controlling rather than  a  direct
authorisation function. Such broad managing or controlling of  the  exercise
of provincial taxing powers is, in the words of  the  Constitutional  Court,
``to ensure the coherence of the taxing system''.

Regulation,  in  terms  of  section  228(2)(b)  of  the  Constitution,   is,
according to the Constitutional Court, therefore,  aimed  at  directing  and
commanding that which has been authorised to be regulated.

Earlier I ventured to say that we crafted the Constitution as a bridge  from
a divided apartheid state to a united nonracial,  nonsexist  and  democratic
state. The residents of Soshanguve will readily  provide  anecdotes  of  the
very short drives, if not walks, that they took to neighbouring Mabopane  to
purchase whatever goods they needed.

They took such  drives  and  walks  because  they  saw  fit  to  exploit  an
incoherence in the taxing system. It made sense to them  to  take  advantage
of the unrealistic tax regime of the  former  Bantustan  of  Bophuthatswana.
The residents of King William's Town will give  the  same  jurisdiction  for
what became a sudden boom in the economy of Bisho.

These stories of inequitable cross-border trade and, at times,  cross-border
smuggling  emphasise  that  high  in  the  minds  of  the   freely   elected
representatives of the people in the Constitutional Assembly must have  been
the fact that if the Republic's  taxing  system  was  to  be  coherent,  the
provinces' power to impose taxes, levies, duties and surcharges  had  to  be
directed and commanded to ensure that, amongst other things, the rate  bands
within which such taxes are imposed do not, in fact, contribute  to  harmful
tax competition among the provinces and are  within  our  macroeconomic  and
fiscal framework. This must be right.

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, Deputy Minister,  members  of  the  House  and
special delegates, first of all I  want  to  talk  about  the  first  public
hearings that the select committee had in 1999 when it was  considering  the
seventh Katz commission report which, among  other  things,  was  cautioning
that, before thinking of introducing this  tax  and  giving  powers  to  the
provinces,  South  Africa,  as  a  country,  should  be  in  a  position  to
understand the implications those taxes would have, taking into account  the
inequities that existed throughout the country in different  provinces.  For
instance, Gauteng could  afford  to  introduce  such  taxes,  but  in  other
provinces the situation was different.

What came out of those hearings  was  again  confirmed  when  we  had  other
hearings during August and September 2001, when we were considering the  FCC
report for the next financial year. When we went to  the  Eastern  Cape  the
members of the legislature expressed serious  concern  about  this  type  of
tax, that it should not disadvantage poor provinces vis-à-vis those who  can
afford it. In this case I am talking largely about Gauteng and  the  Western
Cape life. The rest are very poor and have extremely low fiscal capacity.

However, in considering this legislation, we should take into  account  what
the Deputy Minister has mentioned, that South  Africa  is  a  unitary  state
with a centralised fiscal system. Therefore the  provincial  tax  regulation
has to be viewed in that context. Currently most provinces have a  very  low
fiscal capacity, and they get 96% of their budget from  central  Government.
Only 4% is what they can tax. This is an indication that  as  much  as  this
Bill is important, it may not  yield  the  necessary  results  that  we  are
hoping for. It will go a  long  way  in  addressing  some  of  the  problems
because a cent is better than nothing.

Again, both the 2000 and 2001 Intergovernmental Fiscal Reviews  were  tabled
and reflected that provinces do not collect the very same  taxes  that  they
can collect currently, and to us that poses  a  question  whether  provinces
have the capacity to  collect  these  taxes  or  whether  there  are  proper
mechanisms on how these taxes are supposed to be collected.

In considering  the  legislation,  the  committee  invited  the  SA  Revenue
Service to the committee to respond to the  following  issues.  Firstly,  we
wanted to check whether  there  would  be  any  financial  implications  for
provinces in the event  the  SA  Revenue  Service  became  their  collecting
agency. Secondly, we wanted to check whether the SA  Revenue  Service  would
be able to have the administrative capacity to collect this tax. The  answer
was that they would be able to collect tax on behalf of the  provinces,  and
that they had restructured  the  revenue  services  and  therefore  had  the
capacity to do so.

In response to the first question regarding the  financial  implications  to
provinces, the SA Revenue  Service  said  that  the  financial  implications
would not be more than 2% of  what  it  would  have  collected.  So  in  our
understanding that question has already been  addressed,  and  we  hope  the
situation and the scenario does not change.

This Bill does not prescribe  what  type  of  legislation  provinces  should
introduce. It is only enabling legislation which should guide  provinces  on
what particular processes they are supposed to  follow  if  they  intend  to
introduce tax. If one province has applied for a particular tax,  all  other
provinces can piggyback on that motivation and go ahead and introduce it.

The Bill goes to a great extent in outlining how the  MEC  should  go  about
doing things and about the role of the Minister and others,  but  I  am  not
going to go into that detail.

The last two points I would like to make before I sit down are  as  follows.
I think it is important  to  dispel  some  of  the  notions  raised  in  the
committee, such as the fact that the Bill  cannot  pass  the  constitutional
test. The committee was given several legal opinions by the department,  and
we also checked with the parliamentary law advisers as to whether  the  Bill
was indeed constitutional, since it does not describe or give  the  Minister
powers that are beyond his jurisdiction. What it does is to  simply  outline
the process and the framework. From time to time provinces will be  able  to
introduce their particular taxes and prescribe their tax base,  analyse  the
financial implication on citizens and how is it going to  be  collected  and
so on. I urge the NCOP to support the Bill.
Dr E A CONROY: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Adjunkminister en kollegas, beide  my
dogters het op 'n vroeë ouderdom  hul  onafhanklikheid  probeer  bewys  deur
etenstye self in beheer van die lepel te probeer wees. Soms het van die  pap
onvermydelik op die vloer beland, maar in die proses  het  hulle  toe  reeds
begin om vir hulself te sorg. Kragtens artikel 227 van die Grondwet is  elke
provinsie geregtig op  'n  billike  deel  van  die  inkomste  wat  nasionaal
gevorder word om hom in staat te stel om basiese dienste te  verskaf  en  sy
toegewese funksies te verrig.

Ons  as  verteenwoordigers  van  provinsies  in  hierdie  agb  Huis  behoort
heeltemal begrip te hê  vir  die  provinsies  se  begeerte  om  ook  op  die
nasionale gebied hul selfstandigheid te toon. Ook  die  opstellers  van  die
Grondwet het begrip daarvoor gehad, want in artikel  228  word  daar  verder
bepaal dat 'n provinsiale wetgewer belastingsheffings  en  regte,  maar  met
die uitsondering vir inkomstebelasting, BTW, algemene  verkoopsbelasting  en
eiendomsbelasting of doeaneregte ter aanvulling van sy inkomste kan oplê.
Die bevoegdheid van 'n provinsie om belastingheffings, regte en  bobelasting
op te lê, word kragtens dieselfde artikel in die Grondwet  egter  beperk  in
soverre die genoemde bevoegdhede nie uitgeoefen mag word  nie,  op  'n  wyse
wat  die  nasionale  ekonomiese  beleid,  die  ekonomiese  bedrywighede  oor
provinsiale grense of die  nasionale  beweeglikheid  van  goedere,  dienste,
kapitaal of arbeid wesenlik en onredelik benadeel.  Subartikel  2(b)  bepaal
egter duidelik dat die vordering van  provinsiale  belastings  ingevolge  'n
wet van die Parlement gereguleer moet word en  dit  is  daarom  dat  hierdie
wetsontwerp oor die reguleringsproses van provinsiale  belasting  vandag  in
hierdie  Huis  gedebatteer  word.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Mr Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister and colleagues, both  my
daughters tried to prove their independence at a very early  age  by  trying
to be in control of the spoon at meal times.  Sometimes  some  of  the  food
would unavoidably end up on the floor,  but  in  the  process  they  already
started looking after themselves. In accordance  with  section  227  of  the
Constitution every province  is  entitled  to  an  equitable  share  of  the
revenue raised nationally  to  enable  it  to  provide  basic  services  and
perform the functions allocated to it.

We, as the representatives  of  the  provinces  in  this  honourable  House,
should have complete understanding for the provinces' desire to  show  their
autonomy at national level.  Even  the  drafters  of  the  Constitution  had
understanding for this, because in section  228  it  is  further  determined
that a provincial legislature may impose tax levies  and  duties,  with  the
exception of income tax, VAT,  general  sales  tax  and  property  rates  or
customs duties, to supplement its income.

The power of a province to impose tax  levies,  duties  and  surcharges  is,
however, limited in accordance with the same section in the Constitution  in
so far as  the  mentioned  powers  may  not  be  exercised  in  a  way  that
materially and unreasonably prejudices the  national  economic  policy,  the
economic activities across provincial boundaries, or the  national  mobility
of goods, services, capital or labour. Subsection 2(b)  clearly  determines,
however, that the collection of provincial taxes must be regulated in  terms
of an Act of Parliament and it is for this reason that this Bill  about  the
regulation process of provincial  taxes  is  being  debated  in  this  House
today.]

This is an enabling Bill which is intended to  give  effect  to  the  above-
mentioned powers derived from the Constitution. Provinces, however, are  not
obliged by the Bill to raise their own  taxes  and  neither  does  the  Bill
specify certain taxes which a province may collect.  It  merely  focuses  on
the process whereby their rights in terms  of  the  Constitution  should  be
regulated. It also defines the manner in which the Minister of Finance  will
exercise his policy oversight role.

Hierdie  wetsontwerp  het  nie  net  met  die  regulering  van   provinsiale
belastingbevoegdhede te maak  nie,  maar  verwys  spesifiek  na  die  proses
waarvolgens   die   bevoegdhede    uitgeoefen    mag    word.    Provinsiale
belastingvoorstelle moet byvoorbeeld tien maande  voor  die  begin  van  die
belastingjaar aan die Minister van Finansies voorgelê word.

Die voorlegging moet 'n gedetailleerde ontleding bevat van onder andere  die
redes en die motivering vir die voorgestelde belasting,  sleutelaspekte  van
die beoogde belasting soos die belastingbasis, of die ekonomiese  aktiwiteit
waarop   die   belasting   gebaseer   gaan    word,    aspekte    van    die
invorderingsadministrasie,  beramings   van   die   inkomste   wat   daarmee
gegenereer gaan word en die ekonomiese impak wat dit  sal  hê.  Laastens  is
daar  die  besonderhede  van  die  proses  van  konsultasie  wat   met   die
belanghebbendes gevoer is. Wat  die  invorderingsadministrasie  betref,  het
die Suid-Afrikaanse inkomstediens  reeds  aangedui  dat  dit  oor  voldoende
kapasiteit beskik om belastings doeltreffend namens provinsies en sonder  'n
noemenswaardige toename in administrasiekoste in te vorder. (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This Bill does not only deal with the regulation of provincial tax  powers,
but refers  specifically  to  the  process  whereby  the  powers  should  be
exercised. Provincial tax proposals should, for  example,  be  submitted  to
the Minister of Finance ten months before the start of the tax year.

The submission should contain a  detailed  breakdown  of,  inter  alia,  the
reasons and the motivations for the  proposed  taxes,  key  aspects  of  the
envisaged taxes such as the tax basis or the economic  activities  on  which
the tax is going to be based,  aspects  of  the  collection  administration,
estimations of the income which would be  generated  through  that  and  the
economic impact which this would have. Lastly, there are the details of  the
process of consultation with  the  people  concerned.  With  regard  to  the
collection administration, the South African  Revenue  Service  has  already
indicated that it has sufficient capacity  to  collect  tax  effectively  on
behalf of the provinces without a  significant  increase  in  administration
costs.]

The  Auditor-General  made  some  disturbing  findings  in  his  report   on
financial management by provincial administrations in that:
  Some provinces did not collect all the income that was due to them, and a
  number of registering authorities did not pay licence fees  collected  on
  their behalf to the provinces concerned. Income was lost as not all motor
  vehicles were licensed, and patient fees were  materially  undercollected
  at certain hospitals.

In addition, tariffs for patient fees and licences were  neither  consistent
nor reviewed timeously, and the collection of gaming income was  not  always
effective.

Although we have some reservations as to whether the provinces are  able  to
exploit  optimally  all  the  other  sources  of  income  already  at  their
disposal, the National Treasury has indicated that this problem  is  in  the
process of being corrected. The New NP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr T B TAABE: Madam, Chair of Chairs, I  noticed  that  there  are  probably
quite a number of presiding officers here this  afternoon.  I  do  not  know
whether ... No, let me leave it at that.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, are  you  coming  up  with
the preamble to your speech? [Laughter.]

Mr T B TAABE: Let me not respond to that,  Madam  Chair,  and  just  quickly
deal with the issues at hand.

Madam Chair, hon Deputy Minister and hon members of this House, I wanted  to
deal with the broader constitutional and legal  aspects  of  the  provincial
tax regulation process, but given the manner in which  the  Deputy  Minister
dealt with the constitutional and legal aspects of the legislation, I  think
it would be an exercise in futility, honestly, on my  part  to  want  to  do
that. I feel also that I need to deal very quickly  with  clause  4  of  the
Provincial Tax Regulation Process Bill before  this  House  this  afternoon.
This clause basically establishes that Sars be the collecting  agent  for  a
provincial tax approved in terms of this process.

The point is made in this particular clause that this should  be  the  case,
unless the Minister designates another person or body for this purpose.  The
Bill goes further to say that the Minister of  Finance,  in  this  instance,
will only designate another agency to  be  the  collecting  agent  when  the
province submitting that tax proposal proves that such other agency will  be
able to collect the  tax  more  efficiently  and  cost-effectively  than  an
institution such as the SA Revenue Service.

I must point out that the view of the Select Committee on  Finance  in  this
regard is to fully support this position, precisely because of a  number  of
reasons. Firstly, if this does not happen, any  duplication  in  respect  of
the collection agencies will lead to  inefficiencies,  and  secondly,  might
very well lead to additional compliance costs  for  the  taxpayer.  We  felt
that Sars would then be the only logical collection  agency  for  provincial
taxes that are linked to tax bases that it  already  administers,  that  are
likely to affect a large number of taxpayers and for which an  agency  would
otherwise have to be created.
The point was also made, and we are in full agreement on  this,  that  given
the wide range of possible provincial taxes, there may  be  cases,  however,
in  which  another  agency  will  have  the  necessary  infrastructure   and
involvement in a particular sector that makes it the logical choice  to  act
as the collection agency for that tax.

We also felt that in order to ensure that Sars, in this instance,  is  aware
of and has had an opportunity to evaluate the administrative feasibility  of
a proposed provincial tax, it was therefore proposed that a  requirement  be
inserted in terms  of  clause  4  in  that  Sars  be  consulted  before  the
submission of the proposed provincial tax to the Minister. We felt  that  it
was quite significant that such a clause be inserted.

In closing, I wanted to deal with an issue which was raised very sharply  at
the level of the select committee and by other provinces in relation to  the
possible impact of provincial taxes on local government  taxes.  This  issue
was raised very sharply, and we are of the  view  as  the  select  committee
that a provincial tax cannot directly impact on  any  local  government  tax
for the following reason. Local government can only impose two types of  tax
in terms  of  the  constitutional  powers  vested  in  section  229  of  the
Constitution, which is, one, property tax and, two, surcharges on  fees  for
services provided by a municipality, for example electricity and water.

The point was made, with which we fully agree, that any  other  tax  is  not
right, but could be authorised by national legislation. A case in  point  is
obviously the current RSC turnover and payroll taxes,  which  are  basically
dealt with at the level of the committee. The view was that  this  tax  will
have to be phased out,  or  authorised  by  national  legislation  once  the
transitional period is over.

Hon members of the select committee are quite familiar with the issue  I  am
raising here, and that provinces cannot  impose  a  property  rates  tax  in
terms of section 228(1)(a) of the Constitution, which  specifically  forbids
this power, that is the power to  impose  a  tax.  A  province  also  cannot
impose a surcharge on a property rates tax in terms of section 228(1)(b)  of
the Constitution.

In closing, we are of the view that all  right-minded  South  Africans  and,
indeed, members of this House must support the amendments basically  to  the
Provincial Tax Regulation Process Bill. [Applause.]

Mnr J L THERON: Voorsitter,  agb  adjunkminister,  die  Grondwet  van  Suid-
Afrika maak daarvoor voorsiening dat provinsies die mag  het  om  belastings
te  hef.  Die  Grondwet  bepaal  ook  dat  die  provinsiale  belasting  deur
nasionale wetgewing gereguleer moet word.

Wat is die voordeel van die wetsontwerp? Die wetsontwerp op  die  regulering
van provinsiale belasting het besliste voordele wat  onderstreep  kan  word.
Dit is beslis 'n positiewe stap dat provinsies belastings kan hef.  Dit  sal
beslis die  provinsies  se  posisies  versterk  sodat  hulle  ekonomiese  en
sosiale opheffing en groei in  hul  provinsies  kan  bewerkstellig.  Dit  is
verder ook beslis 'n positiewe aspek dat die  provinsies  self  kan  besluit
watter belasting hulle wil hef tot voordeel van dié bepaalde provinsie.

Dit  is  so  dat  die  situasies,  byvoorbeeld  die  ekonomiese  en  sosiale
ontwikkeling in die verskillende provinsies verskil en daarom  is  dit  goed
dat elke provinsie belasting kan hef  wat  die  beste  sal  voldoen  aan  sy
bepaalde omstandighede.

Dit  is  duidelik  en  voordelig  uit  die  voorgestelde   wetsontwerp   dat
provinsies nie belasting kan  hef  nie  wat  teenstrydig  is  met  nasionale
ekonomiese beleid, ekonomiese aktiwiteite wat oor provinsiale  grense  strek
of die nasionale beweeglikheid van goedere, dienste, kapitaal of arbeid  sal
beperk.

Dit is  positief  dat  die  wetsontwerp  duidelik  uitspel  dat  provinsiale
belastings nie die samehang van die nasionale belastingstelsel oor  al  drie
vlakke van regering mag benadeel nie.

Dit is 'n positiewe aspek dat die finansiële en fiskale  komitee  eers  moet
kommentaar lewer voordat die parlement provinsiale belasting in 'n  wet  kan
aanvaar.

Volgens die finansiële en fiskale komitee sluit  die  beste  belastings  wat
provinsiaal gehef kan word, die  volgende  in:  'n  toeslag  op  persoonlike
inkomstebelasting, 'n heffing op brandstof en belasting op  weddenskappe  en
dobbelary.

Die komitee toon aan dat die toeslag op  persoonlike  inkomstebelasting  die
belangrikste bron van belasting  inkomste  is.  Die  finansiële  en  fiskale
komitee beveel aan dat belastingruimte  geskep  moet  word  vir  provinsiale
belastings  sodat  die  vlak  van  die   belastinglas,   volgens   nasionale
doelwitte, behou word.

Wat is ons voorbehoude? Ons het belangrike voorbehoude oor die  voorgestelde
wetsontwerp. Die belangrikste hiervan is dat die wetsontwerp oorreguleer  en
te veel mag in die hande van die Minister van Finansies plaas.

Eerstens, selfs wanneer  al  die  konsultasieprosesse  van  die  provinsiale
wetgewing  afgehandel  is  en  die  minister  tevrede  is  dat  aan  al  die
grondwetlike aspekte voldoen is, kan daar  steeds  onaanvaarbare  oponthoude
wees voordat provinsies toestemming kry om die belastings in te stel.

Tweedens, die toestemming wat provinsies kry vir provinsiale belasting  hoef
nie noodwendig ooreen  te  stem  met  die  oorspronklike  voorstel  van  die
provinsie  nie,  dít  nadat  reeds  aanvaar  is   dat   die   belasting   in
ooreenstemming met die voorskrifte van die Grondwet is.

Derdens, die ruimte of band wat aan die provinsies toegestaan word, kan  ook
te beperkend wees. 'n Provinsie  kan  byvoorbeeld  besluit  om  'n  bepaalde
belasting teen 6% in te stel en die  minister  kan  besluit  'n  ruimte  van
tussen slegs 2% en 4% word toegelaat. Dit  kan  noodwendig  nadelig  op  die
provinsie se vermoë tot dienslewering en sy prestasievermoë inwerk.

Vierdens is ons  ook  nie  oortuig  dat  die  minister  nasionale  belasting
genoegsaam gaan  verlaag  om  só  vir  die  provinsies  ruimte  te  skep  om
belasting te hef nie. Ons vertrou dus dat provinsiale belasting nie  gebruik
gaan  word  om  belastingkoerse  op  te  jaag  nie.  Ons  weet   almal   dat
belastingkoerse in Suid-Afrika te hoog  is  en  verlaag  moet  word  om  die
ekonomie te stimuleer en werk te skep. Ons  vertrou  dat  dit  nie  weer  'n
kwessie van gee met die een hand en neem met die ander sal wees nie.

Vyfdens, is daar  die  kwessie  van  gelyke  belasting  in  provinsies.  Die
probleem wat hier  aangepak  moet  word,  is  dat  dié  provinsies  wat  die
belasting die nodigste het, die kleinste belastingbasis het.  Ons  meen  dit
is 'n ernstige probleem wat aangepak sal moet word.

Dit  is  belangrik  dat  gelykheid  in  provinsies   aangepak   moet   word.
Dienslewering in al die provinsies behoort naastenby op  dieselfde  vlak  te
wees. Daar kan dus nie toegelaat word dat die omvang van  belasting  wat  in
die provinsies gehef word, te veel van mekaar verskil nie.
Ten slotte, in die lig van al die bogenoemde voorbehoude,  is  dit  duidelik
dat  ons  nie  die  wetsontwerp  kan  steun  nie.  Die  DP  stem  teen   die
wetsontwerp. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister, the Constitution of  South
Africa  provides  that  provinces  have  the  power  to  impose  taxes.  The
Constitution also determines that provincial taxation must be  regulated  by
national legislation.

What is the benefit of the Bill? The Provincial Tax Regulation Process  Bill
has definite benefits which can be underlined. It is  certainly  a  positive
step that provinces can impose  taxes.  It  will  certainly  strengthen  the
provinces'  positions  so  that  they  can  achieve  economic   and   social
upliftment and growth in their provinces. Furthermore, it is also  certainly
a positive aspect that provinces themselves can decide which tax  they  want
to impose to the benefit of the province in question.

The situations, for example the  economic  and  social  development  in  the
different provinces, differ and  for  this  reason  it  is  good  that  each
province can impose taxes which will best meet the needs of  its  particular
circumstances.

It is clear and beneficial from the  proposed  Bill  that  provinces  cannot
impose taxes  which  are  inconsistent  with  national  economic  policy  or
economic activities which  extend  across  provincial  boundaries,  or  will
restrict the national mobility of goods, services, capital or labour.

It is positive that the Bill clearly spells out that  provincial  taxes  may
not negatively affect coherence in the national tax system across all  three
tiers of Government.

It is a positive aspect that the Financial and Fiscal Commission must  first
comment before Parliament can adopt a provincial tax in an Act.

According to the Financial and Fiscal Commission, the best taxes  which  can
be imposed provincially include the following: surcharge on personal  income
tax, a levy on fuel and taxation on betting and gambling.

The commission has indicated that the surcharge on personal  income  tax  is
the  most  important  source  of  tax  revenue.  The  Financial  and  Fiscal
Commission recommends that room should be created for  provincial  taxes  so
that the level of the tax  burden,  according  to  national  objectives,  is
maintained.

What  are  our  reservations?  We  have  important  reservations  about  the
proposed Bill. The most important of these is that  the  Bill  overregulates
and puts too much power in the hands of the Minister of Finance.

Firstly,  even  when  all  the  consultation  processes  of  the  provincial
legislation have been completed and the Minister is satisfied that  all  the
constitutional  aspects  have  been  complied  with,  there  can  still   be
unacceptable delays before provinces receive  permission  to  implement  the
taxes.

Secondly, the permission which provinces receive for provincial  taxes  does
not necessarily have  to  correspond  with  the  original  proposal  of  the
province, and that once it has already been accepted  that  the  tax  is  in
accordance with the prescripts of the Constitution.

Thirdly, the scope or  band  granted  to  the  provinces  can  also  be  too
restrictive. For example, a province can decide to implement a specific  tax
at 6% and the Minister can decide that a range of only between 2% and 4%  is
allowed. This could impact negatively on the province's ability  to  deliver
services and its ability to perform.

Fourthly, we are also not convinced that the  Minister  is  going  to  lower
national taxation sufficiently to create room for the  provinces  to  impose
taxes. We therefore trust that provincial taxation is not going to  be  used
to drive up tax rates. We all know that tax rates in South  Africa  are  too
high and must be reduced to stimulate the economy and create jobs. We  trust
that this will not once again be a  matter  of  giving  with  one  hand  and
taking with the other.

Fifthly, there is the issue of equal  taxation  in  provinces.  The  problem
which must be tackled here is that those provinces which need the taxes  the
most, have the smallest tax bases. We feel that this is  a  serious  problem
that will have to be addressed.

It is important that equality in provinces be  addressed.  Service  delivery
in all the provinces should be at nearly the same level.  We  can  therefore
not allow taxes imposed in the provinces to  differ  from  one  another  too
greatly.

In conclusion, in the light of all the aforementioned  reservations,  it  is
clear that we cannot support the Bill. The DP votes against the Bill.]

Mr J F AULSEBROOK (KwaZulu-Natal): Madam Chair,  hon  Deputy  Minister,  hon
members of this House, firstly I will deal with the process that this  Bill,
with too many other Bills, goes through in the NCOP.

As a second House, we are too often put under extreme  time  constraints  to
process legislation and, as a result,  are  expected  to  rush  through  the
formalities that amount to little more  than  rubber  stamping  Bills  after
they have gone through the NA process. This Bill is a classic example and  I
appeal  to  members  of  this   House   to   honour   their   constitutional
responsibility and not to allow the NCOP to become a mere appendage  of  the
NA. In this case, members of the Select Committee on Finance would not  even
consider dramatic improvements, let alone drafting  improvements  and  other
more substantial changes that are in the interest of all provinces,  because
of these timeframes.

Turning to the Bill itself, in supporting this Bill which is before  us  and
as envisaged in section 228 of the  Constitution,  we  as  a  province  will
approach the implementation with great caution and suggest  other  provinces
do likewise. Creating tax room nationally for provinces to surcharge  income
tax at this present time, has no rational argument to support it.

Let us consider the FFC's proposal to review  the  current  equitable  share
formula in anticipation of this Bill being adopted. It  reaffirms  the  view
that the following provincial taxes constitute the  most  feasible  form  of
provincial own revenue sources. One, a surcharge  on  personal  income  tax,
two, another fuel levy and, three, gambling and betting taxes.

We in KwaZulu-Natal are not  in  favour  of  changing  the  equitable  share
formula to accommodate the impact of  provincial  taxes  on  our  provincial
revenue. The quantum of these taxes is, in any  case,  likely  to  be  quite
small as a proportion  of  the  total  provincial  revenue  and  it  is  not
considered necessary or wise to destabilise the provincial  equitable  share
formula to accommodate the changes  anticipated  from  the  introduction  of
provincial taxes.
We do subscribe to the  rationale  of  the  provincial  fiscal  effort,  but
strongly believe that the provincial revenue has  to  be  tightened  on  the
basis of what is currently  available,  both  in  terms  of  estimation  and
collection  before  we  venture  into  more  complex  methods  of  improving
provincial revenues.

We share the National Treasury's  concern  over  the  FFC's  proposal  on  a
provincial surcharge on personal income tax. This is likely to be  difficult
to administer and its introduction would at best be premature.

The approach, as was contained in the draft Provincial Tax Regulation  Bill,
was instead favoured by us,  whereby  it  was  left  to  the  discretion  of
individual provinces to propose specific provincial taxes in their  area  of
jurisdiction. We however believe that the complexities ...  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr V C XABA (KwaZulu-Natal): Madam Chair, hon Deputy  Minister  of  Finance,
today we are debating a ground-breaking piece of legislation.

KwaZulu-Natal welcomes the Bill as it takes our policy development  forward,
thus maturing our young democracy.

The Bill lays a firm foundation for future  debates  on  the  imposition  of
tax. This is a positive development. However, it must be borne in mind  that
a proposal for a new tax does not, in any way, suggest an additional  source
or sources of revenue, but  introduces  an  additional  form  of  tax  which
individuals and/or businesses will have to be further burdened with.

This development should be welcomed in that it does not  say  to  provinces,
from the day the Bill is made law, that they must begin to  formulate  their
tax proposals. Instead it sets out a process which a province which  desires
to impose tax should follow.  It  seeks  to  regulate  an  intergovernmental
process that must be followed by provinces in  the  exercise  of  the  power
given to them in terms of the Constitution to impose certain taxes,  levies,
duties and so on.

However, it must be  stated  that  concerns  have  been  expressed  that  if
provinces do impose their own taxes at this  stage  that  may  result  in  a
situation where a change in the tax  rate  can  influence  the  movement  of
resources across provincial boundaries. It has  also  been  said  that  that
might actually create competition amongst provinces  which  may  lead  to  a
province with a  strong  tax  base,  like  Gauteng  or  the  Northern  Cape,
imposing affordable low rates and thereby becoming attractive to  businesses
across the country.

Battling provinces, which happen to be largely rural, like the Eastern  Cape
and KwaZulu-Natal, may find it not attractive  at  this  stage  to  consider
provincial tax or taxes of a  substantive  nature  as  this  may  squeeze  a
number of people or businesses  that  are  beneficial  to  their  respective
provinces out of those provinces.

Another concern which has been  expressed  is  that  any  suggestion  of  an
additional tax burden on individuals or businesses can  complicate  our  tax
laws and increase administrative costs, which may negate  the  proposed  tax
benefit.

The experience of countries which have succeeded in tax  law  reforms  shows
more benefit in simplified tax laws. That is the direction South Africa  was
also moving towards. There is also fear  that  if  the  national  Government
were to provide tax room to free up space for provincial  taxes  that  might
diminish the amount to be divided between the spheres of government.

So it is a Bill that must be welcomed with some measure of caution.

Mr J P GELDERBLOM: Madam Chair, after the success of Pieter  Marais  in  his
court interdict today ... [Applause.] [Interjections.] ... it is  an  honour
to be here this afternoon.

The Western  Cape  supports  this  Bill  ...  [Applause.]  ...  although  we
continue to question the constitutionality of the  provision  that  separate
regulatory legislation is required for each type of provincial tax  which  a
province may choose to impose.

It is apparent from this provision, as contained in clause  2(2),  that  the
Provincial Tax Regulation Process Bill is but the first of an entire  series
of regulatory Bills governing the area  of  provincial  taxes.  This  raises
serious constitutional  reservations  which  are  best  summarised  by  Prof
Christina Murray in an article in  last  month's  issue  of  Idasa's  Budget
Watch:


  In its current formulation, the Bill does not seem to be  the  Act  which
  gives effect to the terms of section 228 of the Constitution. Section 228
  envisages an Act ``in terms of which a taxing power will be regulated''.


  This Bill does not set out the terms on which the provincial taxing power
  can be regulated. It merely  creates  the  procedural  framework  to  the
  enactment of the Act that will give effect to the terms  of  section  228
  and give the Minister the task of introducing regulatory legislation at a
  later stage.


  This means that the Bill is at best only part of the legislation required
  by section 228. It regulates  the  process  a  province  must  follow  to
  exercise its taxing powers,  but  does  not  regulate  the  taxing  power
  itself, nor does it provide a framework for the regulation of the  taxing
  power by regulations made by  the  Minister.  That  is  left  for  future
  legislation, contemplated in clause 3(6) of the Bill.


  Moreover, although the Bill seems to promise the section 228  legislation
  in its requirement that the Minister must introduce  it,  the  Bill  does
  not, and could not guarantee that it will be passed. It is always open to
  Parliament to decline to pass a Bill introduced by the executive.

Generally, however, the Bill has  been  though  a  process  of  considerable
ameliorative amendment, and  we  are  particularly  gratified  that  it  now
acknowledges  the  specific  role  of  provincial  legislatures  in  passing
provincial tax legislation.

There are, however, three areas of concern which I wish  to  highlight.  The
first of these relates to the costing of this Bill in terms  of  section  35
of  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act.  As  the  Financial  and   Fiscal
Commission has pointed out, the Bill has cost implications for provinces  in
the sense that  they  are  required  to  conduct  detailed  studies  of  the
financial implications and impacts of any proposed tax.

Secondly, the Bill is silent on the mechanism to be employed  in  the  event
of a deadlock in the negotiation process with the SA Revenue Service,  which
is the designated collecting agent for a provincial tax.  Again  I  turn  to
the submissions of the FFC to the select committee.  While  the  regulations
on collection require  that  agreement  be  reached  with  Sars  before  the
imposition of a tax, it is not clear what the capacity  limitations  of  the
collection agent are.  Therefore,  the  capacity  limitations  of  Sars  may
prejudice certain provinces when  they  wish  to  impose  new  taxes.  There
should be an indication of how disputes or disagreements  between  Sars  and
provinces are going to be addressed.

Thirdly, we are concerned about  the  limited  information  that  is  to  be
submitted to the provincial legislatures in terms of  section  5(3).  It  is
our opinion that the same information which is  furnished  to  the  national
Minister of Finance in terms of section 3(2) should also be  made  available
to the provincial legislatures.

This legislation has been a long time in the making and  the  provinces  can
only welcome the fact that the Bill has now reached the end of its  road  in
the legislature. It goes a long  way  towards  satisfying  our  belief  that
while the collection of revenues from existing provincial sources could,  in
many instances, be improved upon, those provinces  which  have  demonstrated
effective management  of  both  their  income  and  expenditures  should  be
entitled to explore further revenue  sources  with  greater  elasticity  and
creativity.

There now only remains the need to accelerate  the  process  of  identifying
appropriate provincial tax options and including them on the  allowed  list.
This matter has been under consideration for several  years,  and  it  is  a
source of concern  that  efficient  and  well-managed  provinces  should  be
further hamstrung while the Treasury grapples  with  the  possible  problems
which may be posed by those provinces which are  less  able  to  efficiently
manage budgeting and cash management processes.

In conclusion, the Western Cape supports  the  Bill,  subject  only  to  the
constitutional reservation which I have raised. [Applause.]

Mr M I MAKOELA: Madam Chairperson, during  this  interesting  period  it  is
emerging that patriotic and committed citizens of this country,  those  with
progressive minds, have come to realise that opposing just for the  sake  of
opposing has no more place in the politics conducted in this House.

It is a pity that Mr Theron has gone, but we  will  save  that  for  another
occasion. Let me once more emphasise that, as has already been mentioned  by
the hon the Deputy Minister and the  chairperson,  South  Africa  is  not  a
federal state, but a unitary state. Therefore, as much as  the  Constitution
confers upon provinces certain powers to safeguard  the  national  interests
and uniformity of purpose, the overriding powers  will  always  reside  with
the national Government.

Hence the assignment to the national Government by  section  228(2)  of  the
Constitution of the role of  co-ordinating  and  monitoring  the  provincial
powers of the imposition of certain taxes by an Act of Parliament,  and  the
requirement that all proposals for the imposition of  new  provincial  taxes
will have to go  via  the  national  Government,  through  the  Minister  of
Finance to safeguard, among other things, the coherence in the national  tax
system across all three spheres of government.
Contrary to reservations  in  some  quarters,  this  does  not  in  any  way
diminish the powers of provinces to determine their own  taxes nor  does  it
seek to impose the  will  of  the  Minister  and,  therefore,  the  will  of
national Government on provinces, but only determines a uniform  process  to
be followed should a province decide to impose certain taxes.  The  Northern
Province welcomes the Bill. This is contrary to what the hon Aulsebrook  has
just mentioned in that  KwaZulu-Natal  raised  some  reservations  that  the
provinces supported. The Northern Province did not support that.

We welcome the Bill because it opens  the  way  for  provinces  to  exercise
their   constitutional   powers   and,   more   especially,   because    the
responsibility   for   initiating   provincial   tax   proposals   and   the
determination of the kind of taxes to be imposed rest with  provinces,  with
no restriction on specificity as long as the kind of  tax  proposed  is  not
prohibited by the Constitution.

The main objective for  this  Government  remains  the  improvement  of  the
quality of life of all the people in the country. Therefore any  opportunity
that will enable provinces to raise extra revenue, thereby  improving  their
capacity  to  roll  out  programmes  that  will  help   correct   historical
inequities in the accessing of public services, social  development,  health
and education, should be highly welcome by this House. We therefore  support
the Bill. [Applause]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  thank  hon
members for  their  participation  and  support  for  this  Bill,  with  the
exception of one or two people in this House who did not. I  would  like  to
just pick up on a few of the points raised by various members.

I think it was the hon Theron, if I am not mistaken, who  raised  the  point
on the limitations that could be placed on the rate that  could  be  charged
by a province and how that might impact on  service  delivery.  I  think  in
raising this issue the important thing not to forget is also  the  potential
negative economic impact of  excessive  rates  that  may  be  charged  by  a
province. So one must not only think in terms of the revenue  that  will  be
realised because one is charging a higher rate, but  also  link  this  to  a
point raised by the gentleman from  KwaZulu-Natal.  He  said  that  we  must
recognise that the sources are the same. This is simply  an  additional  tax
that one is imposing. We need to be conscious of those things.  We  must  be
conscious of the fact that one is not necessarily talking about  a  new  tax
base, one is really talking about the same people or businesses which  would
be paying these very same taxes.

The issue around timeframes that has been raised in processing  legislation,
I think, is really something we should not  be  arguing  about,  but  rather
recognising  as  something  to  improve  upon.  The  issue  of  harmful  tax
competition - the whole issue about a tax impacting on  economic  activities
across provinces or impacting on the movement of goods and  services  across
provinces - is actually a much wider issue. We are dealing with  this  issue
not just in the context of SADC this issue is being dealt with worldwide  in
terms of how tax dispensations can actually pervert economic consequences.

Right now we are dealing with this issue in the context of SADC,  because  I
think we are potentially approaching  what  is  called  ``the  race  to  the
bottom'' in which each country wants to have the lowest floor of tax  rates.
Now, in the context of trying to build a region that might not promote  that
objective. I am just saying that the issue around  the  impact  of  the  tax
across provinces is an important issue, which, I think, we need to  keep  in
full view all the time so that we do not have what  I  would  call  perverse
consequences in  the  way  this  would  impact  on  economic  activities  in
provinces. So while it is important for us to have  this  legislation,  this
is an issue that we need to approach cautiously.

Regarding the concern that there might be delays  in  the  Minister  passing
the regulatory legislation, I do not know why that issue is arising  because
that is a legal requirement. This is what clause 3(6)(b) of the  legislation
says. So I do not know why there would be concern that  the  Minister  might
delay passing that regulatory framework.

Again, with regard to disputes with the Revenue Service, I also do not  know
why that concern is arising, because we designate  the  Revenue  Service  as
the agency that will do the collections unless, of  course,  another  entity
is identified to do that on the basis that we can show that such  an  entity
can do that efficiently and effectively. So I do not  know  why  that  issue
does arise.

I think that those are minor concerns, some of  which  I  do  not  think  we
should be overly worried about. I would like to thank all  hon  members  for
participating in the debate. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     PENSION FUNDS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson and hon  members,  we  introduce
today, for the  consideration  of  this  House,  the  Pension  Funds  Second
Amendment Bill, commonly referred to as the Pension Surplus Bill.

The Bill is an expression of our movement towards a more democratic  society
in that it redresses past injustices by providing a mechanism  to  equitably
and in a sustainable manner apportion actuarially determined surpluses  that
have  accrued  over  the  years  and  introduces  new  obligations  for  the
provision of minimum benefits in private  pension  funds,  registered  under
the Pension Funds Act of 1956.

This Bill ensures that past practices, which unjustly affected  our  people,
are rectified, and provides mechanisms  to  ensure  that  surpluses  do  not
arise or are not artificially created to serve the greed of  the  privileged
few who remain behind in such funds.
The broad themes surrounding the pension surplus debate concerned the  right
of access to surplus and the coverage of such a surplus.  It  addressed  the
question of whether it  is  appropriate  to  use  surplus  to  redress  past
inequities. We adopted what we  term  a  stakeholder  approach  as  we  were
drafting this legislation. Through this approach we  say  that  the  surplus
that exists in a pension fund,  although  belonging  to  the  fund,  may  be
apportioned between the broad categories of employees  and  members  of  the
fund in a prescribed manner after taking into account the financial  history
of the particular fund.

The following principles guided Government's position  on  this  stakeholder
approach: equity; the  elimination  of  risk-sharing  between  employer  and
employee;  protecting  the  savings  performance  of   the   industry;   the
separation of the past from the future; and the  preservation  of  stability
in this sector.

Broadly speaking, these are the issues that we used to help guide us  as  we
entered the debate and the negotiations around this particular  legislation.
We believe that this approach  is  one  that  should  be  equitable  to  all
parties, in particular the risk and the reward should be shared between  the
stakeholders.

Furthermore, the solution should not adversely impact the  general  economic
situation  in  the  country.  We  also  had  macroeconomic  concerns  as  we
approached this particular debate. This stakeholder approach is contrary  to
the views of labour, which states that the surplus  belongs  to  members  of
the fund. It is contrary to the views of business,  which  states  that  the
surplus is  by  right  that  of  the  employer,  as  it  bore  the  risk  in
guaranteeing the pension promise to its member employees.

As an important principle, therefore, Government felt that  former  members,
current members and the employer should all  participate  in  the  actuarial
surplus. No one group has an exclusive claim,  except  to  the  extent  that
former members and pensioners needed to be  topped  up  to  minimum  benefit
levels as a prior charge to redress  issues  of  inequity.  Thereafter,  all
should participate in a distribution of the residual surplus,  after  taking
into account the financial history of the fund. The latter will  inform  the
board as to where the surplus came from  and  guide  them  as  to  who  best
should enjoy it.

Under this dispensation, in regard to former members: If they received  less
than the amount needed to satisfy their  reasonable  expectation,  there  is
moral justification for topping them  up,  because  they  were  inadequately
informed and educated at the time of transfer or retrenchment.  All  members
have a reasonable expectation that benefit improvements would be  considered
if there is a surplus in a fund. If no such improvements were awarded  while
the former members belonged to the fund, despite the generation of  surplus,
the former members were denied a chance of benefit improvements  after  they
were moved out of that fund.

With regard to  members,  they  will  have  a  reasonable  expectation  that
benefit  improvements  will  be  considered.  As  far  as  the  employer  is
concerned, conservatism by the actuary and  unexpected  real  returns  often
meant that employers paid  more  than  was  needed  to  fund  the  benefits.
Therefore the employer  has  a  reasonable  expectation  of  enjoying  lower
future contributions, a so-called contribution holiday.

In adopting this stakeholder approach, the Pension  Funds  Second  Amendment
Bill attempts to propose a solution, with Solomonic  wisdom,  to  the  long-
standing legal problem of who owns the pension surplus accruing  in  private
pension funds with an estimated value of  R80  billion  as  at  31  December
2000.

The Bill specifically only  provides  for  the  apportionment  of  surpluses
existing,  at  the  time  of  the  enactment  of  the  Bill,   between   the
stakeholders, being members, former  members  and  the  employer.  The  Bill
lawfully gives these stakeholders rights to such assets and  prescribes  how
such assets may be utilised.

The Bill further provides for minimum benefits in respect of  pension  funds
to be paid in future in defined circumstances, such as cases of transfer  or
retrenchment.

These minimum benefits are introduced to  ensure  that  members'  reasonable
expectations are satisfied in future. Members will  now  receive  reasonable
value in future in respect of their  contributions,  rights  and  reasonable
expectations, leaving any surplus generated in future to be managed  by  the
board of the fund in accordance with its rules.

These minimum benefits are extended backwards as a  standard  against  which
former members' benefits or transfer values will be compared.  Amounts  paid
to former members will be topped up to this standard as part of the  surplus
utilisation. A technical committee representative of the  stakeholders  will
determine  the  actuarial  assumptions  underlying   the   minimum   benefit
standard. There will be  wide  consultation  before  the  principles  behind
these assumptions are fixed. The  committee's  recommendation  will  require
the approval of the Minister  of  Finance  before  being  published  in  the
Gazette.

By requiring a top-up to the amounts paid in respect of former  members  who
left a fund after 1 January 1980,  and  in  equitably  apportioning  surplus
after this top-up, the Bill in many respects answers the plea of workers  to
right some of the wrongs of the past. In introducing minimum benefits to  be
paid in future, the Bill will prevent wrongs which still happen  today,  and
which, if nothing is done, will continue to happen in future.

In establishing rights to surplus once apportioned, the Bill will  answer  a
plea from employers, and the retirement fund industry,  to  bring  certainty
to the use to which surplus assets can be  put.  In  doing  this,  the  Bill
answers a plea from our Supreme Court of Appeal to legislate so as  to  give
the courts guidance and to avoid the  current  situation  where  the  courts
have to address the issue on a case-by-case basis, with  guidance  primarily
from foreign retirement funding environments. In one of the cases that  took
place in our courts, the only other experience that could  be  found  was  a
Canadian experience on how  to  deal  with  the  issue  of  distribution  of
surplus.

This Bill represents the completion of  a  long  and  gruelling  process  of
negotiation. I would just like to briefly sketch, for  the  benefit  of  the
members, the background to and the history of this  Bill.  Until  late  1999
employers were effectively denied any opportunity  to  access  in  cash  the
surplus assets in pension funds.

Following the Financial Services  Board's  Appeal  Board  decisions  in  the
Lintas and the Paarl Widows' and Orphans' Pension Fund cases, the  registrar
was instructed to allow funds to amend  their  rules  to  pay  the  residual
surplus on liquidation to  the  employer  in  certain  circumstances.  These
rulings opened a  floodgate  to  payment  of  assets  from  a  pension  fund
directly to the employer on liquidation of the fund.

This was potentially very serious, because  the  mass  transfer  of  members
from defined benefit funds to defined  contribution  funds,  many  of  which
were sponsored by trade unions, as opposed to the employer,  had  left  many
defined benefit funds with lots  of  surplus  funds  ripe  for  liquidation.
Further, these funds had few members, many of  whom  were  senior  employees
with whom the  employer  could  easily  strike  a  balance.  In  these  ripe
circumstances, efforts to access the funds  for  the  benefit  of  employers
intensified. Obligations  started  piling  up  at  the  Registrar's  Offices
seeking to access these surplus funds.

In September 1999 the  Supreme  Court  of  Appeal  in  the  Tek  Corporation
Provident Fund case ruled that neither members nor the employer had  legally
enforceable rights to the surplus. After quoting from a  Canadian  judgment,
the Supreme Court of Appeal stated that the broad policy  issues  raised  by
surplus debates ``would be better resolved by legislation than by a case-by-
case consideration or individual plans''.

The court stressed the need for trustees to exercise their fiduciary  duties
to work towards the aims of the fund concerned, as embodied  in  its  rules.
It also proposed that the stakeholders of the fund, including the  employer,
negotiate the distribution of the  surplus  and  amend  the  rules  to  give
effect to the distribution.

As Government we recognised that a change to the law was urgently needed  if
the process was to be managed without inequity to  a  significant  group  of
former members. Its concerns were based on the belief  that  past  transfers
and retrenchments were inequitable, with hindsight, and part of  the  reason
for this was an inequality of knowledge and access  to  professional  advice
at the time of the original events.

The issue  here  is  that  there  was  an  imbalance  that  existed  between
employers  and  employees,  or  workers,  at  the  time  a  lot  of  workers
transferred out of pension funds into either defined contribution  funds  or
provident funds. The bulk of the members had moved out of the funds  already
on transfer terms which had been negotiated in the formative years  of  many
of our trade unions, without the parties having an  equal  understanding  of
defined benefit funding and equal access to professional advice.

Sometimes these former  members  left  with  only  their  own  contributions
accumulated with a low rate of interest. Seldom did they enjoy any  form  of
the actuarial surplus or the difference  between  the  fair  value  and  the
actuarial value of assets, which protected the fund against a  fall  in  the
stock market.

In  the  absence  of  Government  action  to  introduce  an  equitable   and
acceptable Bill, former members of funds would be denied any  voice  forever
regarding any claim to and any share in  the  accrued  surplus.  This  would
largely have been the case if  the  process  suggested  by  the  courts  was
allowed  to  proceed   without   legislative   intervention,   because   the
negotiations suggested would have excluded former  members,  such  as  those
who had already transferred out of defined benefit funds.

Once the surplus was paid out to  the  employer  and  the  residual  defined
benefit funds had been liquidated, former members would  be  forever  denied
access to surplus, much of  which  had  been  accumulated  while  they  were
members.

As both  business  and  labour  were  important  stakeholders,  the  pension
surplus issue was referred to Nedlac to gain  consensus  on  the  principles
and content of  the  Pension  Surplus  Bill,  which  was  envisaged  as  the
principal output of that process. I think, for obvious reasons,  the  Nedlac
process failed to deliver a consensus. Literally, the parties stood  on  the
extreme opposite ends of this particular issue, with the  workers  believing
that the surplus is theirs and nobody else's  and  business  believing  that
surplus in a  fund  is  theirs  and  theirs  only.  One  could  not  achieve
consensus in that situation.

The  process  in  Nedlac,  however,  was  extremely  helpful  in   providing
Government with a  better  understanding  of  the  basis  of  both  parties'
concerns. After 18 months of  discussions  in  Nedlac,  it  was  clear  that
business and labour were far apart on the  major  issues  of  principle  and
were not coming any closer despite intensive discussions.

Business  failed  to  effectively  table  a  mandated  position   on   which
negotiations could even begin. This remained the position even  at  the  end
of the Nedlac process when, as Government, we had  to  make  a  decision  to
legislate by taking the matter out of  Nedlac's  hands  and  finalising  the
Bill on the stakeholder principle and its underlying principles.

A number of parties made written and oral representations. We would like  to
commend organisations such as Cosatu, the  Association  of  Retired  Persons
and  Pensioners,  the  Actuarial  Society  of  SA  and  the  Life   Offices'
Association for the detailed input they submitted and their argument on  the
main points of principle. We would also  like  to  thank  the  Pension  Fund
Adjudicator for his input on discrimination and  dispute  resolution.  These
comments helped us to refine this particular Bill.
The gazetted Bill provided for equitable apportionment  in  a  process  that
should satisfy regulations. The  draft  regulation  answered  the  important
questions such as: How far back should a fund go  to  determine  the  former
members who may participate? How much should these former members get?  What
methods could be used to distribute the balance of the  surplus?  These  are
matters that will be determined in regulations.

The principles behind those regulations are  the  following:  the  issue  of
adding back surplus that may have been improperly utilised by the  employer;
retrospective review back to 1 January 1980; topping up to  minimum  benefit
levels as a prior charge, in other words, if there is  an  existing  surplus
the first charge on that surplus is to top up to minimum benefit  levels  of
members or former members;  and  equitably  distributing  the  balance  that
exists. There are many issues that the regulations are going to  deal  with,
but I do not want to get into those particular issues.

In  conclusion,  the  implementation  of  this  Bill  will  not  be  without
practical difficulties. These will include the  existence  of  past  records
and accurate employer data, informing the general public of  the  provisions
of this Bill and tracing former members. These are  all  of  the  challenges
that are going to face us as we implement this Bill.

We are aware of these challenges, but we also think it is important  for  us
to deal with the inequities that took place in the  past,  and  to  come  up
with a dispensation to then regulate the issue  of  a  surplus  distribution
going forward. A successful outcome can only be  achieved  if  business  and
labour approach the principles embodied in the Bill within  the  letter  and
the spirit of the legislation.

To conclude, I would like to revert to  the  title  of  an  address  to  the
Institute of Retirement Funds' conference of May 2000.  The  slot  given  to
discussion of retirement fund surplus was aptly entitled:  ``Surplus  -  the
ongoing saga.''


  A good saga, ladies and gentlemen,  has  features  such  as  passion  and
  greed; people who have been denied what would satisfy their  expectations
  by others who were more powerful than themselves; a story which stretches
  across generations; and a happy ending.

The saga around the entitlement to the distribution of pension fund  surplus
has all of these features, except the last one - that of a happy ending.  In
placing the Bill before the House, may  it  be  the  beginning  of  a  happy
ending. [Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, I am not going to repeat most  of  the  things
the Deputy Minister has talked about. I think this was a  very  complex  and
difficult piece of legislature. Just to give members some idea, on  the  day
of the meeting we had to negotiate to bring the  two  stakeholders  together
in agreeing on the Bill as the committee was going to finalise it.

I think some of the indications tell us that even at this  late  stage  both
business an labour are not satisfied with the Bill  as  it  is.  However,  I
think the  process  must  continue.  The  select  committee,  including  the
officials who were present at the meeting, agreed  that  the  Bill  must  be
passed with the few amendments that the committee  proposed,  and  that  the
department should  come  back  to  Parliament  from  time  to  time  if  any
difficulties are experienced in the process of implementation. It was  clear
that if we were going to agree on the  issues  raised  by  both  labour  and
business, we were not going to pass this legislation by today.

I just want to talk about three issues. I think one of  the  most  important
points to come out of the committee was  around  the  principle  of  record-
keeping.

I think, as all hon members know, that records can only be  kept  for  seven
years and, therefore, some hon  members  expressed  concerns  regarding  the
practicality of getting records  dating  back  to  1980.  However,  we  were
assured by the Financial Services Board  that  different  pension  funds  do
have such records. So they will be able to  furnish  those  records  as  and
when they are needed.

Furthermore, even if those records are not found, a public process could  be
embarked upon in terms of which all those who used to be members of  pension
funds could be invited to come and submit  information.  And  I  think  that
from  time  to  time  pension  funds  do  give  their   members   individual
statements. We think that these fears are unfounded.

The second point is around  the  retrospectivity  of  the  Bill.  On  Monday
morning, before the committee met, we had a fourth  submission  from  a  law
firm which clearly indicated that they still had concerns  about  the  Bill,
and also that in their view the Bill was  unconstitutional.  We  think  that
the process should continue.

The fears that business in particular  has  expressed  around  these  issues
are, in our view, unfounded. They are unfounded  because  when  people  were
disadvantaged by different pension funds that discriminated against them  in
the 70s, 80s, 90s, etc, no one said that was unconstitutional. This Bill  is
supposed to correct the wrongs that  have  been  perpetuated  for  the  past
years; now some people say that the Bill  is  unconstitutional.  So  in  our
view their fears are unfounded.

Some white businesspeople, who did not make submissions to the TRC to  state
what they did during the apartheid era, now have the guts  to  come  to  the
committee and say that the Bill  is  unconstitutional,  forgetting  all  the
things that they did. So in our view their fears are not justified.

I think the two issues that I have just dealt with show that  both  business
and labour fear the unknown. They both do not know what is going  to  happen
when this Bill is finally implemented. In the view  of  the  committee,  hon
members should allow the process leading to the implementation of  the  Bill
to run its course. Upon implementation, when problems arise, the  department
could then come before the committee and before members of  Parliament  and,
either through questions or motions, engage the Minister of  Finance  so  as
to get some progress in that regard.

Mainly, these are the  two  issues  I  wanted  to  touch  upon.  The  Deputy
Minister has dealt with the rest.

The committee has proposed three technical amendments,  which  I  call  upon
this House to support. [Applause.]

Ms C S BOTHA: Chairperson, hon Minister, the substance of the Pension  Funds
Second Amendment Bill has been a hot topic for years in  boardrooms  and  on
the shop floor. The reason is, to an extent, that  it  has  all  the  public
appeal of the story of Robin Hood. Unfortunately, as in the story,  although
the action has more appeal, it does not have legal sanction.

The objective of the Bill is to bring clarity to the question  of  ownership
and equitable distribution of current surpluses. It seeks  to  avoid  future
build-up of such surpluses. A substantial effort has  been  made  to  ensure
that the principles of fairness and equity are built  into  the  legislation
rather than forcing people to resort to these Robin Hood tactics.

Unfortunately, trying to combine in this procedure remedy for both past  and
future action creates a whole raft of legal problems. In the past  the  acts
that created this surplus were lawful in terms of  the  Pension  Funds  Act,
the rules of the fund, applicable jurisprudence and the common law.  And  as
a result stakeholders and investors who subsequently invested in funds  have
attained certain rights or at least benefit expectations. These actions  are
now  being  undone  with  retrospective  effect  and  are   being   declared
retrospectively improper.

Why should employers, we can well ask - and the point has been  argued  this
afternoon - who used pension fund surpluses to gain a  contribution  holiday
or to boost reserves of their companies or to give  additional  perks  to  a
select band of employees, not be made to give back these gains  when  it  is
quite clear that they obtained this prize - the pension fund  surplus  -  by
dubious argument rather than fair means? But this is  where  the  rub  lies.
However unfair the action seems from today's vantage point, it was done,  at
the time, within the ambit of the law, and,  as  the  Minister  has  pointed
out, was also international practice.

This is a major problem for the DP. Do we decide that two wrongs - I  direct
this to Mr Makoela - make a right, and that we can  retrospectively  correct
the wrongs of the past? Unfortunately, to do so one must do  it  within  the
legal framework. It would have felt, at  least  temporarily,  like  a  moral
victory, but we cannot. We are now erecting  a  new  paradigm  precisely  to
move away from government-by-force which allowed pension  funds  to  do  the
morally wrong thing within the sanction of the law.

There  is  another  major  practical  stumbling  block  -  the  tracing   of
contributors, as many as 900 000 in some funds, to whom back  payments  must
be calculated. Business South Africa proposed  that  the  back  payments  be
limited to the compulsory seven-year record-keeping  period,  but  the  Bill
has insisted on a 22-year period back to 1980. Common sense tells  one  that
this is going to be almost impossible to comply with.

Additionally, the Bill will allow funds that were either badly  administered
or depleted before this Bill became law and therefore have no  distributable
surpluses, to be freed from the compulsion to pay back.

If the present Bill becomes law, logic dictates that a case should  be  made
against such trustees in order to recoup the money. Instead, the  unfairness
is compounded by the comment of the  Financial  Services  Board,  which,  in
speaking for the Treasury and in refuting  the  objections  raised  to  this
anomaly, said: ``The employer can, instead of funding a deficit,  walk  away
from the fund in deficit through liquidating the fund and  distributing  the
inadequate assets amongst the members,  thereby  passing  the  risk  to  the
members''. Surely, this is an unacceptable line of argument.

As we will raise in connection with the Unemployment Insurance Bill, the  DP
also has a problem with the public sector being excluded from the  ambit  of
the Bill. This is creating a separate class of employer and giving  rise  to
new inequalities.

We do not dispute that the decisions were made  based  on  a  few  cases  of
failure of regulation  by  the  previous  government  within  unequal  power
relations  -  to  use  our  feminist  terminology  -  and  that,  therefore,
reviewing these decisions is now appropriate. Many of the proposals  in  the
Bill will remedy the situation. But in the light of what we perceived to  be
its constitutional ambiguity, its administrative burden  and  its  selective
attribution of stakeholder  responsibilities,  the  DP  cannot  support  the
Bill. [Interjections.]

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chairperson, I must really indicate  that  a  lot  has  been
factored upon in my statement.  But  I  just  need  to  gallop  through  and
highlight a few points. [Interjections.]

The key objective of the Bill is to make provision for the apportionment  of
actuarial  surpluses  for  minimum  benefits.  Business  South   Africa   is
concerned about the retrospective nature of this Bill. It believes  that  it
is improper to apportion a surplus which exists in the fund to  persons  who
left the fund more than 20 years ago.

In their view those persons were treated correctly in  terms  of  the  rules
and contractual obligations of the fund at that time. The  Select  Committee
on Finance was, of course, as our chairperson has mentioned,  privileged  to
be briefed by the Financial Services Board on the retrospective  element  of
the Bill, in terms of which it argued that members of the pension funds  are
provided  every  year  with  a  benefit  statement  that  entails   critical
information  used  to  determine  the  benefit  payable.   Therefore,   that
information could be used as data that would go back 20 years.

In conclusion, I must make the point that the ANC stands firm  on  its  view
that the Bill, as presented by the Portfolio Committee  on  Finance  in  the
National Assembly, reflects an appropriate compromise between the  views  of
Cosatu and Business SA. Therefore, as  the  ANC  we  support  this  amending
Bill. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Adjunkminister en  kollegas,  hierdie
wysigingswetsontwerp is daarop gerig om die Wet op  Pensioenfondse,  Wet  24
van 1956, te wysig, deur die daarstelling van minimum  waardes  wat  in  die
toekoms  deur   aftreefondse   onder   gedefinieerde   omstandighede,   soos
byvoorbeeld verplasing en afdanking, betaalbaar sal wees.

Die belangrikste wysiging is egter  genoodsaak  deur  die  surplusfonds  van
ongeveer R80 miljard wat deur die jare deur pensioenfondse opgebou  is.  Die
groot vraag wat ontstaan het is: Aan wie behoort die  surplus?  Behoort  dit
aan  die  werkgewers  of  behoort  dit  aan  die  werknemers?  Met   hierdie
wysigingswetsontwerp word daar  gepoog  om  'n  billike  toedeling  van  die
bestaande surplusfonds tussen lede, voormalige  lede  en  die  werkgewer  te
bewerkstellig en 'n proses daar te stel waarmee 'n billike verdeling  verkry
kan word.

Om 'n beeld van die onderhawige probleem te vorm, is dit nodig dat  daar  'n
duidelike  onderskeid  getref  word  tussen,  eerstens,  die   gedefinieerde
voordeelfonds, met ander woorde die fonds wat bepaal dat  'n  sekere  bedrag
aan die werknemer betaal sal word die  dag  wanneer  hy  of  sy  aftree,  en
tweedens, die gedefinieerde bydrafonds.  Laasgenoemde  is  'n  pensioenfonds
waarin beide die werkgewer en werknemer vasgestelde  bydraes  stort,  waarná
die bedrag, wat aan die werknemer by aftrede  uitkeerbaar  is,  gelykstaande
sal wees aan beide sy of haar en die werkgewer se bydraes, asook  die  rente
wat intussen daarop verdien is en die beleggingsgroei  wat  die  bedrae  oor
die jare gerealiseer het.

Hoewel intensiewe konsultasies  en  onderhandelings  oor  hierdie  kwelvraag
binne die raamwerk van Nedlac plaasgevind het, en  waartydens  besigheid  en
arbeid klaarblyklik beide met logiese en  oortuigende  aktuariële  argumente
vorendag gekom het, kon aanvaarbare konsensus nie bereik word  oor  wie  die
surplus  toekom  nie.  Aangesien  daar  nie  in   die   onderhandelings   'n
aanvaarbare ooreenkoms tussen die  besigheidsektor  en  arbeidsektor  bereik
kon word nie, moet hierdie  aktuarieel-tegniese  wysiginswetsontwerp  as  'n
aanvaarbare kompromis tussen die twee uiteenlopende sienings  aanvaar  word.
Die Nuwe NP  steun  die  wysigingswetsontwerp.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Mr  Chairman,  hon  Deputy  Minister  and  colleagues,  this
amending Bill is aimed at amending the Pension Funds Act, Act  24  of  1956,
by the setting  of  minimum  values  that  will  in  future  be  payable  by
retirement funds, under stipulated circumstances, for example transfers  and
dismissals.

The most important amendment is however necessitated by the surplus fund  of
about R80 billion that has been built up by the pension  funds  through  the
years. The big question that has arisen, is: Who  does  the  surplus  belong
to? Does it belong to the employers or does  it  belong  to  the  employees?
This amending Bill is seeking to procure a reasonable apportionment  of  the
existing surplus funds to members, previous members and the employer and  to
bring about a process through which a fair dispensation could be achieved.

To form a picture of the problem in question, it  is  necessary  that  there
should be a definite  distinction  between,  firstly,  the  defined  benefit
fund, in other words the fund which states that a certain amount  should  be
paid to the employee on the day on which he or she  retires,  and  secondly,
the defined contributory fund. The latter is a pension fund  in  which  both
the employer and the employee deposit set amounts,  thereafter  the  amount,
which is payable to the employee on retirement, will be equal  to  both  his
or her and the employer's contributions, as well as the interest  earned  on
it in the meantime and the  investment  growth  that  was  realised  by  the
amounts over the years.

Although intensive consultations and negotiations on this thorny issue  took
place within the framework of  Nedlac,  during  which  business  and  labour
apparently both came up with logical and convincing actuarial arguments,  an
acceptable consensus on  who  is  entitled  to  the  surplus  could  not  be
reached. Because an acceptable agreement could not be achieved  between  the
business  sector  and  the  labour  sector  during  the  negotiations,  this
actuarial-technical  amending  Bill  should  be  seen   as   an   acceptable
compromise between two divergent views. The New  NP  supports  the  amending
Bill. [Applause.]]

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, Deputy Minister, the ANC supports  the  objectives
of the Pension Funds Second Amendment Bill. The  Bill  clarifies  the  vexed
question of ownership and the equitable distribution  of  current  surpluses
in respect of defined benefit pension funds. The  Bill  further  avoids  the
build-up of such surpluses and provides for and brings  clarity  to  minimum
individual reserves and minimum benefits in respect of pension increases.
Much effort and substantial  consultation  has  gone  into  the  legislation
currently before this Parliament. A substantial  effort  has  been  made  to
ensure that the principles of fairness and equity are incorporated into  the
legislation. However, I would like to pay special attention to the  proposed
section 30(3) of the Bill that makes the employer liable  for  the  deficit.
If a fund is terminated or dissolved and the fair value  of  its  assets  is
less than its minimum individual reserves, the shortfall would  represent  a
debt to the fund by the employer, while Business SA considers that it  would
be unreasonable to require an employer to meet such a deficit as  the  Board
of Trustees and not the employer would have been responsible for  investment
decisions. Business SA, therefore, argued  that  this  provision  should  be
deleted.

Our response, however, is that this  argument  is  weak  for  the  following
reasons. Firstly, the employer appoints as many as 50%  of  the  members  of
the board. For the board to adopt an investment strategy which is  imprudent
would require the participation of these employer-appointed members who  can
be expected, in any event, to report back to the employer on an  issue  such
as an investment strategy.

Secondly, nothing prevents the rules from requiring  that  the  employer  be
consulted before the investment strategy  is  adopted  by  the  board.  This
would protect the employer against such imprudence.

During the hearings on this  Bill,  Business  SA  argued  that  members  and
former members of pension funds should have no  right  of  recourse  to  the
dispute resolution process. The members of the Select Committee on  Finance,
however, endorsed the Bill in this regard.

The Bill seeks that members and former members have a right to  complain  to
the board. The board of pension funds is obliged to inform the registrar  of
these complaints and the action taken. The registrar then has the  right  to
refer he matter to the  specialist  tribunal.  If  the  members  and  former
members are aggrieved at the registrar's refusal to refer the  apportionment
to the specialist tribunal, they  may  lodge  an  appeal  to  the  Financial
Services Board's appeal board.

The registrar will therefore decline to  refer  cases  in  which  there  are
outstanding complaints at his peril. In all likelihood, unless  a  complaint
is obviously trivial, referral to the specialist tribunal will take place.

The ANC votes in favour of the Bill before this House. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, again I  would  like  to  thank
members for  participating  in  the  debate,  particularly  those  who  have
supported the Bill. I see that the hon Sandra Botha is not here.

An HON MEMBER: She is here.

The DEPUTY  MINISTER:  Oh,  is  she  here?  [Laughter.]  [Interjections.]  I
thought she had run away. I would like to say to her  that  the  problem  is
that she kisses frogs. [Laughter.] She must stop  kissing  frogs,  then  she
can read the South African situation  correctly,  because  I  think  she  is
missing the point. The point here is not so much about legality.

In any case, even if we were arguing issues of legality, it  does  not  mean
that something that is legal at a particular point cannot be wrong. I  think
that is part of the history of South Africa. A lot of things that were  done
under the auspices of the law were actually wrong. We  can  go  elsewhere  -
the German situation and the crimes that were committed  against  the  Jews,
for example. Those are issues that are being dealt  with  today,  and  these
were things that were done within a legal framework.

When I say that she is missing the point, I think the issue  here  is  this:
In the past a lot of  abuse  occurred  in  pension  funds  as  members  were
transferred or retrenched out of pension funds either into  provident  funds
or, as I said, retrenched. People were transferred or retrenched  and  given
less than their fair value of what belonged to them in the pension fund.  In
cases in which surpluses were used in the past by employers, they used  that
in an inequitable fashion.

What is even worse today, which would really, really  duplicate  the  wrongs
that were done in the past, is that we have funds today out  of  which  most
of the members have been transferred,  and  those  funds  remain  with  huge
surpluses and few members. If we say that we are going  to  distribute  that
surplus to the few members who are remaining, when there were  gross  abuses
that were done in the past against those members who  were  transferred  out
of those funds, then one is missing the  point  -  the  issue.  The  Pension
Funds Act did not sanction the kinds of abuses that  occurred.  The  Pension
Funds Act is the legislation that we still use  today.  We  are  looking  at
reviewing it, simply because there are  so  many  changes  that  have  taken
place. It is an old Act, but it is still an Act we are using  to  date,  and
we are not challenging the validity of that legislation.

The issues we are trying to address are equity and fairness.  That  is  what
we are dealing with here. I think we must note the ruling of the  courts  in
the Tek Corporation case, in terms of which it was said that it is best  for
us to have a legislative framework to manage the  whole  issue  of  surplus,
and who has a right and how one distributes surplus.

We are very clear on this. The legislation separates - it is not confused  -
the past from the future. The past comes in to the extent that  we  feel  we
must address issues of historical inequity that took place. We will do  that
once and for all, and then going forward we  will  have  a  sound  framework
within which to manage  the  issues  of  the  surplus  that  accumulates  in
pension funds.

The issue of liquidation of funds, which was raised by  a  member  here,  is
something that we have considered as an absolute last  resort  in  order  to
avoid situations in which pension funds can  collapse.  Out  of  this  whole
process we would still like to see healthy pension funds  in  South  Africa,
which is something that we have today. We would not like to undermine  that,
even as we address the historical inequities that took  place.  This  is  an
option that arises really almost as a last  resort  when  there  cannot  be,
through the processes that we establish, a way of  dealing  with  a  deficit
that may exist in a particular fund.

Those are just some of the issues that I thought I  should  pick  up  on.  I
would like to thank members again. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution (Democratic Party dissenting).

       POLICIES AND CHALLENGES PERTAINING TO PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson, I thought the  Deputy  Minister
of Finance was talking about my pension. [Laughter.] It gives me  particular
pleasure to speak here this evening and to commend  this  House  for  taking
the decision to debate this very  important  human  rights  cause.  Could  I
therefore convey my sincerest congratulations to all of the members who  are
responsible for focusing their attention today on  the  question  of  people
with disabilities.

This cause requires a far higher public profile than it has at  present.  It
seems to me that it is not  only  the  Office  on  the  Status  of  Disabled
Persons, but  certainly  the  elected  institutions  that  we  have  in  our
country, including the media, that have to give a higher public  profile  to
this particular subject.

Let me start with a quotation from President Mbeki, who  at  that  time  was
the Deputy President, in a foreword he  wrote  to  the  Integrated  National
Disability Strategy. This is what he said:


  Among the yardsticks by which to measure a society's  respect  for  human
  rights, to evaluate the level of  its  maturity  and  its  generosity  of
  spirit is by looking at the status that it accords to  those  members  of
  society who are most vulnerable, the disabled people, the senior citizens
  and its children.


  The concept of a caring society is  strengthened  and  deepened  when  we
  recognise that disabled people enjoy the same right as we do and that  we
  have a responsibility towards the promotion of their quality of life.


  We must stop seeing disabled people as objects of  pity  but  as  capable
  individuals who are contributing immensely to the development of society.

The central challenge  therefore  that  all  of  us  face  is  how  best  we
integrate people with disabilities into all  avenues  of  life.  Since  1994
much progress has certainly been made. Yet we cannot  but  admit  that  vast
challenges remain, not the least of which a deeply ingrained  mind-set  that
relegates the disabled to the margins of society. We must not  be  satisfied
until  there  is  full  integration  and  participation  of   persons   with
disabilities in society, as a basic tenet of human rights.

This must go hand in hand with the  eradication  of  inequalities  based  on
race, gender and religion, all  of  which  were  so  powerfully  experienced
under apartheid. Let us ensure that in every aspect of  life  -  from  train
and taxi to Tuynhuys, from hamlet and hospital  to  metropolis  -  there  is
justice for disabled people.

It would be ironic  were  it  to  happen  that  freedom  was  achieved  from
apartheid, freedom was  achieved  from  sexism  and  gender  discrimination,
freedom was achieved from mind control, detention and  repression,  and  yet
disabled persons in our society remained unfree.

The challenges we have faced since 1994  essentially  had  to  do  with  the
extent to which we could translate these  universally  held  positions  into
concrete  realities  for  people  with  disabilities;   how   to   implement
programmes, to change mind-sets and to transform  the  social  landscape  to
create a truly democratic people-centred society  where  South  Africans  in
general, and people with  disabilities  in  particular,  can  share  in  the
benefits of such a society in the broader sense.

In view of our human rights approach, we have deliberately moved  away  from
the medical/welfare model of disability that viewed it  within  the  context
of pity, and located power  over  disabled  persons  in  the  hands  of  the
medical and welfare professions. We consider the restoration of the  dignity
and the right to determine one's  own  future  to  be  cornerstones  of  our
process of integrating people with disabilities into society.

We would rather  see  disabled  people  working  productively  within  their
capacity, to contribute to the economy  and  to  their  own  wellbeing  than
sitting in the sheltered atmosphere of hand-outs and no real work; and  very
little activity generally. Where they require physical  or  other  forms  of
assistance, it is the duty of society to provide this.
From the beginning  of  our  democracy,  we  took  deliberate  decisions  to
include people with disabilities on our  election  lists  and  our  national
legislature  in  consequence  included  no  less  than  ten   members   with
disabilities.

It is a matter of some pride, it seems to me, that it would be  accurate  to
say, I think, that we have  more  people  with  disabilities  in  our  South
African  Parliament  than  almost  any  other  parliament  in   the   world.
[Applause.]

Can I digress for a minute and appeal to  the  representatives  of  all  the
political parties here, including the ANC? When we have  the  next  election
in 2004, I  hope  all  political  parties  will  include  more  people  with
disabilities when they draw up their lists. Parties should not put  them  at
the bottom of their lists, they should put them at the top so that they  can
get elected. [Applause.]

This really is an appeal to all the  political  parties.  I  am  not  making
propaganda for the ANC. The truth of the matter  is  that  the  overwhelming
majority of people with disabilities come from the  ANC  list.  This  is  an
appeal to all the other political parties.

We have got to ensure that more people with disabilities  get  elected  into
national Parliament, into provincial  legislatures,  into  local  government
positions. I can add that almost every single important commission  that  is
set up by either the  Cabinet  or  through  the  parliamentary  process  now
includes a person with a disability.

After the  second  democratic  election  in  1999,  we  established  in  our
Parliament a joint monitoring committee on disabled youth and children.  The
chief was one of them. This parliamentary committee has all the  powers  and
responsibilities  of  parliamentary  committees  to  monitor,  evaluate  and
oversee the programmes of Government in these areas. I hope  they  do  their
job, but, never mind.

We also established in the Presidency the Office on the Status  of  Disabled
Persons, which takes specific responsibility for advancing,  evaluating  and
monitoring the  administrative  policy  on  disability,  ensuring  that  all
Government departments pull their weight and also clearly liaising with  all
civil society structures dealing with the issues of disability.

We are currently starting a liaison and communication side of  this  office.
It is very important to understand  that  this  office  is  located  in  the
Presidency.  The  President  himself   has   to   take   overall   political
responsibility for this question.

Since  not  only  elected  structures  need  attention,  a  representatively
constituted SA Federal Council for the Disabled  was  established  to  bring
together all disability groupings and NGOs to make  a  fully  representative
body, pushing for the transformation of the disability sector.

In addition we have several pieces of legislation that directly address  the
concerns of disabled persons, specifically as they relate to  discriminatory
practices in the workplace. The most notable among these are  the  Promotion
of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act and  the  Employment
Equity Act.

The former deals directly with the question of  environmental  accessibility
and defines reasonable accommodation in the workplace.  The  latter  outlaws
discrimination on the basis  of  disability  when  recruiting  personnel.  I
would suggest that, in addition to having a welcome look into its  heart  on
the question of race, the advertising industry should consider the  position
of disabled people too and actively  include  them  in  its  activities  and
campaigns and thus help to change traditional mind-sets.

Yesterday President Mbeki spent quite some time speaking about  imbizos  and
how it is necessary to go to the rural areas,  off  the  nice  tarred  roads
onto  the  most  difficult  potholed  roads.  I  ask  that  when  the   NCOP
representatives go on their provincial  visits,  they  should  go  to  these
areas and see what is happening to people with disabilities.
Are we doing enough? Are the local government structures doing  enough?  And
if we are not, then they  should  come  back,  compile  a  report  and  make
concrete proposals as to how we can address these issues. I just  hope  that
the NCOP itself will begin to take this as one of its  critical  tasks  when
it carries out its own provincial visits. Hon members  of  the  NCOP  should
not just leave it to the portfolio committee. To fulfil one's  duty  in  the
committee is very important, but it cannot function unless the rest  of  the
members of Parliament also take it seriously.

But there are other things. The Department of Labour drafted us  a  code  of
good practices for when we are monitoring and evaluating. What one needs  to
do is say that here is Government's policy, here  is  legislation,  what  is
happening  in  this  country  in  terms  of  the  implementation   of   this
legislation?

For example, are we  doing  enough  within  the  Public  Service  itself  to
implement our own legislation? What is  happening  in  the  private  sector?
That is what I would understand by monitoring and  evaluation,  not  sitting
there and deciding whether this Minister is a good Minister and whether  the
committee is going to call this Minister to its meeting. The  Minister  will
come to your meeting.

The question is: Do we have the capacity, do we have the drive, do  we  have
the commitment to do the hard work? It is very hard  work  to  monitor.  One
must go and read, one must go and talk, one must  look  for  indicators  and
that is why I said earlier that I hope  that  the  parliamentary  committees
will do  their  bit  of  the  work,  because  if  we  do  not,  people  with
disabilities will remain within the legislation itself.

I want to make a last point. The OAU has declared the first decade  of  this
new millennium as the African Decade of Disabled Persons.  It  seems  to  me
that it is necessary for our elected institutions to  ensure  that  when  we
talk about implementing this new partnership for African  development,  that
this African decade for persons with disabilities remains  a  central  focus
of what we want to do in that part.
In  my  view  if,  on  our  side,  we  are  not  doing  enough,  it  is  the
responsibility of institutions like Parliament to come and  say,  ``You  are
not doing enough, you need to do more,'' and so on and so forth.

My appeal to this House is that we have to do something about  this  African
decade. The truth of the matter is that if we do not do  anything  about  it
in South Africa, very little is going to happen elsewhere on our  continent.
We therefore do have a very important responsibility towards people  on  the
rest of our continent. [Applause.]

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, hon Minister in the Presidency,  hon  members,
hon Chairperson of the GMC who is sitting up there in the gallery,  we  once
more express our sincere  appreciation  to  the  Chairperson  and  the  team
around her, those wise men and women, for having agreed and  having  allowed
us to hold this important and significant debate on policies and  challenges
pertaining to people with disabilities.

We invited persons from the disability sector to be  part  of  this  debate.
The intention was that some of us would sit over there, listening to  us  as
we speak. I regret to inform the Chairperson that  some  of  our  colleagues
from this sector could not join us, due to the fact that our gallery is  not
fully accessible. It is not fully accessible.

Earlier today the Chairperson of the NCOP did indicate that,  starting  from
next week, this House will be repaired or refurbished. We hope that when  we
come back next year, it will be accessible to people with disabilities.

Before 1994 the apartheid regime treated people with  disabilities  as  sick
persons who should be given pensions or grants, people who should be  locked
up and kept out of sight. They were not believed to  have  the  capacity  to
work for themselves and their families. No effort  whatsoever  was  made  to
integrate or empower them. Obviously the approach  of  the  previous  regime
was therefore based on what is called ``the medical model''.

With the advent of the ANC to power,  the  new  Government,  in  conjunction
with Disabled People  South  Africa  and  the  disability  rights  movement,
changed from that model to  a  social  model.  This  model  moves  from  the
premise that disabled people are first and foremost human  beings  and  need
to be treated as such.

It means that disabled people need to be integrated into the  mainstream  of
society as much as possible. This,  therefore,  breaks  down  into  disabled
children going to mainstream schools, living at  home  with  their  families
and being provided quality assistive devices so as to enable  them  to  lead
active lives like all of us.

They  should  have   access   to   accessible   transport.   Hopefully   the
recapitalisation programme will take this into consideration. We have had  a
number of meetings with the Minister of Transport,  and  he  indicated  that
this is part of the criteria which are being used, namely that  as  we  plan
the new transport system we will have to consider accommodating people  with
disabilities. We should also be  treating  disability  as  a  criterion  for
affirmative action.  Disabled  people  should  generally  have  their  human
rights  protected  and  entrenched,  as  is  the  case  now   in   our   new
Constitution.

Moreover,  disabled  persons  should  also  be  provided  with   space   and
opportunity to use their creative, artistic  and  intellectual  capacity  to
the maximum, obviously not only for their own  benefit,  but  also  for  the
benefit of the entire community.

We are proud to announce that  the  ANC-led  Government  has  pioneered  the
cause of giving disabled people a resounding voice in the  affairs  of  this
country through passing legislation to promote the human rights of  disabled
persons. Examples of such documents and legislation are the White  Paper  on
the Integrated National Disability Strategy, the  White  Paper  on  learners
with special needs, the South African Library for the Blind Act, the  Labour
Relations  Act,  the  Employment  Equity  Act,  the  Basic   Conditions   of
Employment  Act,  the  Promotion  of  Equality  and  Prevention  of   Unfair
Discrimination Act and many others. I could go  on  and  on,  but  we  would
finish very late.

The other critical achievements include the Constitution  and  its  Bill  of
Rights, which prohibits  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  disability  and
recognises sign language as a language of the deaf people and as a  language
that needs to be protected.

Another major recognition of the  right  of  people  with  disabilities  and
their contribution globally culminated in the founding of the  international
day for people with disabilities, which is  3  December.  Disabled  Peoples'
International pushed for its founding, and it was adopted by the UN and  the
OAU in 1992. The objective of the day is to highlight progress achieved  and
what further work needs to be done with regard to people with disabilities.

Our Government is more than committed to mobilising the state as a whole  in
this critical terrain of  struggle.  Many  of  our  people  on  the  African
continent are disabled, and this is as a result of conflicts  and  wars  and
their legacies. There are other painful consequences of war  and  conflicts,
such as unemployment and displacement.

It is against this backdrop that we welcome the declaration  of  an  African
Decade of Disabled Persons by the disabled people's  organisation  in  1988.
Subsequent to this declaration the 35th assembly  of  heads  of  states  and
governments of the OAU declared 3 December  1999  to  3  December  2009  the
decade of disabled persons in Africa, and also  expressed  their  unwavering
commitment and support for the efforts of these organisations.

Let met remind  members  that  our  President  launched  the  South  African
chapter of the decade on 5 December 1999. This decade is significant,  given
the level of disability caused by the past  and  present  conflicts  on  our
continent, Africa.

Due to the fact that I do not  have  enough  time,  will  you  allow  me  to
conclude by saying: As members of Parliament, as  citizens  of  this  lovely
country, South Africa, we have  a  responsibility  to  occupy  our  rightful
place on the global stage, and at the same time make a meaningful  input  in
the development of humanity.

As I said in the previous debate, hope  was  a  rare  commodity  during  the
apartheid period, but under this new era of democracy, hope is  no  more  an
illusion. [Applause.]

Mev J WITBOOI: Voorsitter,  agb  Minister  en  lede,  vir  solank  'n  groot
liggaam soos die Wêreld Gesondheid Organisasie nog nie daarin kon  slaag  om
die woord ``gestremdheid'' raak te omskryf nie, sal ons hierdie  debat  moet
voortsit.

Hoe definieer ons gestremdheid? Is die  fisiese  gestremdheid  wat  met  die
eerste oogopslag waarneembaar is die enigste tipe  gestremdheid  wat  in  ag
geneem word wanneer beleid oor die aspek geformuleer word?  Hoe  akkommodeer
en hoe handel ons met daardie tipes  gestremdhede  waarvan  ons  eers  bewus
word tydens direkte interaksie met andere?

My persoonlike ondervinding het my genoop om tydens my  werksaamhede  in  my
bedieningsgebied, en ook tydens my daaglikse omgang  met  mense,  dieper  te
kyk na hierdie ``stille gestremdheid'' in ons  gemeenskappe.  Vergun  my  om
vandag in die tyd tot my  beskikking  oor  hierdie  stille  gestremdheid  te
praat.

Ek is die ma van 'n 23-jarige,  hoogs  intelligente  en  andersins  begaafde
jongman wat baie swaar hakkel. Die pad na  volwassenheid  was  nie  vir  hom
maklik nie. Tydens sy primêre skooljare moes hy baie keer die  spotnaam  van
hakkelaar verduur. Ek het baie keer saam met hom seergekry  en  ineengekrimp
wanneer mense in sy teenwoordigheid grappe oor hakkelary tot  groot  vermaak
vertel het.

Sy   eerste   werk,   wat   hy   na   sy   N3-sertifikaat   as   motor-   en
dieselwerktuigkundige aanvaar het, het hy  as  'n  gebroke  jongman  verlaat
omdat hy deur 'n ongevoelige  werkgewer  as  gevolg  van  sy  spraakprobleem
uitgelag is. Baie dae en maande se pastorale berading het hom nie  heeltemal
van hierdie nare ondervinding genees nie, en hy,  soos  ek  later  uitgevind
het vele ander in soortgelyke omstandighede, vermy vandag nog  omstandighede
waar hulle  in  'n  poging  om  werk  te  bekom  aan  mondelinge  onderhoude
blootgestel word. Hulle wil nie meer seerkry nie.

Ek  wil  vandag  hier  vra  dat  hierdie  gebrek  ook  as  'n   gestremdheid
gedefinieer moet word, en dat wanneer werknemers 'n aanduiding moet gee  van
hoeveel gestremdes hulle aan diens het,  daar  gekyk  sal  word  na  hoeveel
doofstommes  en  mense  met  spraakgebreke  van  hierdie  werkerskorps  deel
uitmaak.

Daar is 'n potensiële sterk mark van jongmanne en  -vroue  wat  hulself  nie
sal spaar om Suid-Afrika te maak werk  as  hulle  net  gehelp  word  om  uit
hierdie  wurggreep  van  stille   gestremdheid   te   beur   nie.   ``Stille
gestemdheid'' omdat hulle net stil word, en later heeltemal wegraak.

Ek dank die Minister vir die vordering reeds  gemaak  om  die  lewensgehalte
van die gestremdes te verbeter. Die komiteevoorsitter en -lede  moet  bedank
word vir die ekstra myl wat hulle loop om die vordering te monitor.  Dit  is
'n voorreg om op die komitee te dien.

In die Weskus, waar ek vandaan kom, is daar 'n  gesegde  wat  lui:  ``Jy  is
soos 'n kraan wat drup''. Dit beteken jy hou nie op nie. Ek gaan  nie  ophou
praat nie, want die doofstommes kan nie praat nie, en die hakkelaars is  nog
nie gereed om vir hulself te praat nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mrs J WITBOOI: Chairperson, hon Minister and members,  for  as  long  as  a
huge body such as the World Health Organisation cannot succeed  in  defining
the word ``disability'' we will have to carry on with this debate.

How does  one  define  disability?  Is  the  physical  disability  which  is
perceivable with the first glance the only type of disability  which  should
be taken into account when policy is  formulated  around  this  aspect?  How
does one accommodate and deal with those types of disabilities of  which  we
only become aware during direct interaction with others?
My personal experience has compelled me to look more closely at  this  quiet
disability in our communities during my activities in my  ward  as  well  as
during my daily association with people. Allow me today, in the time  at  my
disposal, to talk about this quiet disability.

I am the mother of a 23-year old, highly intelligent and otherwise  talented
young man who stutters severely. The road to  adulthood  was  not  easy  for
him. During his primary school years  he  had  to  endure  the  nickname  of
stutterer on many occasions. On many occasions I felt the hurt with him  and
cringed when people in his presence made jokes about stuttering.

His first job, which he accepted after he obtained  his  N3  Certificate  as
motor and diesel mechanic, he left as a broken  young  man  because  he  was
laughed at by an unfeeling employer as a result of his speech problem.  Many
days and months of pastoral counselling did not entirely heal  him  of  this
terrible experience, and he, like  many  others  in  similar  circumstances,
later found out, still chooses to avoid circumstances where  in  an  attempt
to find work they are subjected to oral interviews. They do not want to  get
hurt any longer.

Today I want  to  ask  here  that  this  imperfection  also  be  seen  as  a
disability, and that when employers have to give an indication of  how  many
disabled people they have in their employ they should look at how many  deaf
mutes and how many people with speech disabilities make  up  part  of  their
workers' corps.

There is a potentially strong market of young men and  women  who  will  not
spare themselves to make South Africa work if they are only  helped  to  get
out of this stranglehold of quiet disability. ``Quiet  disability''  because
they become quiet and eventually later completely disappear.

I thank the Minister for the progress made to improve the  quality  of  life
of disabled people. The chairperson of the committee and  committee  members
should be thanked for the extra mile they walked to  monitor  the  progress.
It is a privilege to serve on this committee.

On the West Coast, where I am from, there is a saying which goes: ``You  are
like a dripping tap''. This means that you never stop. I  am  not  going  to
stop talking because the deaf mutes  cannot  talk  for  themselves  and  the
stutterers are not yet ready to talk for themselves.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, I read this on  behalf
of my  colleague  the  hon  Raju.  There  is  a  serious  lack  of  reliable
information on the nature and prevalence  of  disability  in  South  Africa.
This is because, in the past, disability issues were viewed  chiefly  within
a health and welfare framework.

Another factor is the tendency of society to view people  with  disabilities
as  a  single  group.  Thus,  people  in  wheelchairs  become  the   popular
representation of persons with disabilities. This, of  course,  ignores  the
diversity of disability and the variety  of  needs  experienced  by  persons
with different types of disability. It is critical to note  that  disability
does not only affect the disabled individually, but also the family and  the
immediate community.

The majority of people with disabilities in South Africa have been  excluded
from the mainstream of society and have thus been prevented  from  accessing
fundamental social, political and economic rights.

The political and economic inequalities of the apartheid  system  played  no
small part in the exclusion experienced  by  people  with  disabilities  and
their families. Social  attitudes,  too,  have  perpetuated  stereotypes  of
disabled people as dependent and in need of care.  Democratic  South  Africa
must ensure that the discriminatory  and  weak  legislative  framework  that
sanctions and reinforces exclusionary barriers is a thing of the past.

In the South African situation, poverty, unemployment and  social  isolation
play a  dominant  role  as  key  forms  of  exclusion  responsible  for  the
cumulative disadvantage of disabled people. People  with  disabilities  face
extreme levels of inequality and discrimination. Different social,  economic
and   political    factors    interact    and    create    underdevelopment,
marginalisation,  unequal  access  to  resources  and  a  lack  of   service
provision.

One of the challenges  for  the  Government  is  to  seriously  address  the
critical problem of inaccessibility faced by people with disabilities.  This
refers to buildings, communications intended  for  deaf  and  blind  people,
services such as public transport, and opportunities for social  interaction
such as sport and recreation.

Only yesterday the hon the President addressed this august House  and  spoke
passionately of how South Africa cannot ignore the  plight  of  poor  people
with regard to proper access to roads, clinics, housing,  education,  social
welfare, etc. If the challenges of infrastructure are immense  for  ordinary
citizens, how much greater is this challenge to provide  infrastructure  for
the wellbeing of people with disabilities?

The issue of gender equality is currently receiving high priority, with  the
status  of  women  high  on  the  Government's   agenda.   Capacity-building
programmes and organisations addressing special  social  problems  of  women
are on the increase, and rightly so. My party pleads this  afternoon  for  a
similar  commitment  and  resolve  to  place  the  needs  of   people   with
disabilities on a par with the needs of women. Indeed, the  Constitution  of
the Republic of South Africa dictates that the improvement of  the  equality
of life of disabled persons is just as important as the improvement  of  the
quality of life of women, youth and children.

We therefore ask Government bureaucracy not  to  make  life  more  difficult
than they are when addressing the pragmatic  needs  of  our  distressed  and
disabled fellow South Africans. [Applause.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Hon Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  special  delegates,  hon
colleagues, firstly allow me to congratulate  the  hon  Lewis  Ndzimande,  a
member  of  the  National  Assembly  and  a  disabled  person  who  is   the
chairperson  of  Disabled  People  of  SA.  Secondly,  also  allow   me   to
congratulate  the  chair  of  the  joint  monitoring  committee,   the   hon
Hendrietta Bogopane, who is chairing so excellently.  We  also  congratulate
the other members of this committee. [Interjections.]

It is my pleasure to address this House  on  policies  and  challenges  that
pertain to people with disabilities. I would like to pay  special  attention
to the role of Parliament in advancing the rights of disabled people.

When our parliamentarians  review  and  monitor  legislation,  and  exercise
their oversight role on national departments and the national Budget,  great
care must be taken  to  ensure  that  parliamentarians  include  disability-
friendliness  as  one  of  their  variables  in  executing  their  oversight
functions.

By so saying, there is terminology which we use that is  not  acceptable.  I
am not going to dwell too much on it. But, for example, instead of saying  a
particular person uses a wheelchair, we say he or she  is  wheelchair  bound
or is confined to a wheelchair. Such  utterances  are  not  needed  in  this
community. We should rather say: This particular person uses  a  wheelchair.
Amen.

People with disabilities are very vulnerable to the misuse of  language  and
terminology where terminology  has  the  effect  of  labelling  people  with
disabilities,  stereotyping   them,   discriminating   against   them   and,
ultimately, creating a culture of nonacceptance of diversity.

While our national Constitution and Acts such as the Promotion  of  Equality
and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, outlaw discrimination based  on
disability, parliamentarians need to  take  additional  measures  to  ensure
that this legislation has relevance for the many disabled people.

Government is in favour of an  affirmative  action  programme  for  disabled
persons in terms of which all Government departments  and  statutory  bodies
have  disabled   people   comprising   at   least   2%   of   their   staff.
Parliamentarians, when exercising their  oversight  functions,  must  ensure
that all requirements that pertain to disabled people are fulfilled.  It  is
alarming that some national departments have not employed a single  disabled
person.

The plight of disabled persons, moreover, is not the  concern  of  just  one
sphere of government. All spheres of government are equally responsible  for
highlighting the needs of disabled people. The specific  needs  of  disabled
people are not limited to national, provincial or local  competencies.  They
are multisphere needs of a concurrent competency.

The usual response to the needs of  disabled  people  is,  for  example,  an
increase in welfare grants to disabled people, and disabled  children  being
relocated to special schools  that  are  remotely  located  from  the  urban
centres. The more appreciated approach to the needs of disabled persons  and
which the ANC Government supports is  one  of  integration  into  mainstream
society.

Allow me this time to commend and congratulate the headmaster of  a  school,
the Harry Oppenheimer Agricultural High, which is in  Potgietersrus  in  the
Northern Province. Two disabled learners were taken from the  Letaba  School
for  the  Disabled  and  admitted  to  the  Helen  Franz  School   for   the
Handicapped. The principal admitted them without asking a lot of  questions.
They are doing so well, and their teachers are saying they are happier  than
they were at their previous institutions.

Disabled persons may have specific needs, such  as  access  to  wheelchairs,
sign language or  Braille  facilities.  In  all  other  instances,  however,
disabled persons are  capable  of  functioning  just  like  any  nondisabled
person.

There is one example with which members of this House  should  be  familiar,
namely Advocate Zak Yacoob, who is currently a Constitutional  Court  judge.
Some of us present may recall that he is  a  well-known  political  activist
and anti-apartheid lawyer from the days of the UDF. He  is  openly  labelled
as the ``blind advocate''. The question of his competency is not taken  into
consideration but his physical disability gives him that name.
The approach to the needs of disabled  persons  is  not  to  increase  their
reliance on welfare grants but to facilitate their  access  to  society  and
permit them  to  live  ordinary  lives  while  their  individual  needs  and
specifications are addressed. Persons with disabilities have the same  needs
as nondisabled people with such minor  exceptions  as  access  to  assistive
devices. In all respects,  such  as  the  right  to  have  families  and  to
procreate, the ability to be managers  and  the  right  to  be  economically
independent, they are exactly the same as the rest of society.

The words of the disabled lawyer Albie Sachs are most  enlightening.  He  is
also a well-known freedom fighter  and  a  Constitutional  Court  judge.  He
said, after returning from exile, that he felt liberated for the first  time
only after meeting  disabled  people  in  South  Africa  and  learning  that
disabled people were fighting  and  not  waiting  for  their  rights  to  be
achieved. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member,  I  am  afraid  that  your
time has expired.
Mrs C NKUNA: Very well, Chairperson.

There is a document  that  the  House  should  look  at.  It  is  about  the
employment of disabled people. When looking at this document,  we  see  that
the equation is not balanced with  regard  to  the  employment  of  disabled
people. The disabled are not allowed and not given an opportunity  to  apply
for these posts. With regard to telephone switchboard  operators,  there  is
that short note which states that they should apply for that. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I think what we miss today is  the  presence  of
our colleague, Mr Willem. We moved a resolution today giving  him  leave  of
absence. He  is  our  colleague,  he  is  disabled.  He  is  confined  to  a
wheelchair. He has had  a  stroke  and  he  would  have  made  a  tremendous
contribution to this debate, had he been with us. We miss him and  wish  him
well. We are sorry that he has not been able to make the great  contribution
that he would have liked to make today.

When we talk about disabled people, we are not talking  about  a  peripheral
group. Some 13% of the public are disabled in one way or another.  The  aged
people are. Some people are temporarily  disabled,  others  permanently.  It
has been my privilege to spend  a  lifetime  working  amongst  disabled  and
disadvantaged people.

The Minister has said that we should do something about it. I  think  he  is
right. One of things that we can do about it is to visit every  one  of  our
villages  and  towns  in  our  constituencies  to  see  whether  the  public
buildings are accessible to people that are disabled in one way or  another.
We can do  that  and  we  can  draw  the  attention  of  our  town  or  city
authorities to problems.

Lying at the heart of the  problem  of  the  disabled  is  the  question  of
access. If one does not have access to a building,  one  can  have  all  the
skills in the world but one will not  be  able  to  work  there.  Access  to
buildings and physical access to jobs is absolutely  vital.  The  Government
has made enormous progress in recent years and we  are  grateful  for  that.
[Time expired.]

Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, I think it is a bit unfair for Mr Durr to  always
receive only one minute. We cannot help it. It is how Parliament  works  and
we must respect the Rules of Parliament. We are all party to making them.

A nation which neglects and discriminates against its disabled  citizens  is
itself a disabled nation. It therefore means that  such  a  nation  requires
special  attention  to  unlock  it  from  its  ignorance   and   disability.
Accordingly, no country, no  people  can  ever  claim  to  be  free  if  its
disabled citizens are not free.

Thanks to the people of this country under  the  leadership  of  an  ANC-led
Government, gradually, step by step, we have set our country on the  correct
path, towards prosperity for all its people.

Accordingly, as we move forward  on  this  path  of  building  a  prosperous
society and improving the quality of  the  lives  of  all  our  people,  the
disabled citizens of our country are not  spectators.  They  themselves  are
active participants in the reconstruction  of  our  country.  Clearly,  this
demonstrates the resolve of our people and its Government in  ensuring  that
we create a people-centred, people-driven reconstruction of our country.

The ongoing work being done by our Government  and  other  progressive  NGOs
like the DPSA in ensuring the integration of the needs of our disabled  into
the mainstream needs to be commended.

Over the  past  seven  years  we  have  seen  the  gradual  development  and
implementation of progressive policies which cater for the special needs  of
all our disabled. Whether it is with respect to education, health,  housing,
or economic development, all our policies, without exception, have been  and
continue to be sensitive to the needs of our disabled citizens.
Practical steps are being taken to ensure that we adhere to our  progressive
policies. For example, Housing has budgeted for the provision  of  assistive
devices for disabled people needing houses.  The  state  has  also,  through
Public Works, embarked  upon  the  reconstruction  of  most  of  our  public
buildings to ensure that they are accessible to the needs of  the  disabled,
so that they can participate in public processes.

We have recently  seen  the  case  of  Baby  Tshepang,  a  young  baby  from
Upington. She is lying quietly in the Kimberley hospital under extreme  pain
and grief. She is the face of the many  children  in  our  society  who  are
subjected to the worst form of human abuse by  those  who  are  supposed  to
take care of them.

I am raising this, primarily because amongst those  who  are  disabled,  are
those who have been abused in the past. Baby Tshepang is also  going  to  be
disabled, not because of natural acts, but primarily because  of  those  who
cannot control their natural desires. Clearly such acts by morally  bankrupt
individuals must be condemned in the strongest terms by all  our  people.  I
think all the members of this House will contribute to the funds set  up  to
address the needs of Baby Tshepang. She should be able to recover from  that
horrendous act and be able to address her permanent disability,  because  of
those acts which were uncalled for.

Once again the festive season is upon us. Let us appeal to  all  our  people
to uphold the rule of law. Let us not drink  and  drive,  primarily  because
that increases the rate of disability in our communities. Let us  not  drive
recklessly, because we might  increase  the  rate  of  disabilities  in  our
communities. Let us do everything possible to make sure that at the  end  of
the year, when we return again to Parliament, all our people  are  safe  and
that we have not increased the number of disabilities, primarily because  of
our reckless behaviour on our roads. It is important to  take  this  message
out to all our people: It is important to uphold the law, so that we do  not
create unnecessary disabilities within our communities.

I wish to call upon all our people and members of this House and  Parliament
as a whole. On 3 December we will be recognising the  International  Day  of
Disability. Let all of  us  in  our  own  constituencies  be  part  of  such
activities and make sure that we mark these activities with  the  importance
they deserve and highlight issues of disability.

The DPSA has produced a booklet. It is called an empowerment tool. It  is  a
pocket guide book on disability and equity. I deem it  appropriate  for  all
our members to have such booklets, primarily because they are important  and
they are able to explain in detail the work that we are doing as  Government
and NGOs on the plight of the disabled. What is required from all of  us  is
to contribute towards improving the quality of  life  of  the  disabled  and
making sure that they are part of the mainstream of our society.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson, as I said the last time  I  was
here, I wish I came more often to this House. It is a  very  pleasant  House
to be in. Let me thank all  the  speakers  who  spoke  for  the  views  they
expressed. I would like to touch on one of the views.

However, I want to start with the advert that has been  distributed  by  Mrs
Nkuna. First of all, I  thought  there  was  only  one  Parliament  in  this
country and that it was in this  building,  but  I  see  it  is  called  the
Western Cape provincial parliament. I thought they  were  a  legislature.  I
think it is wrong. It actually is discriminatory to have  two  adverts.  One
of them encourages disabled persons to apply; in  another  one,  nothing  is
said at all.

I will ask the Office on the Status of Disabled Persons  to  actually  write
and complain to the provincial  legislature  about  it.  I  say  thanks  for
bringing this to my notice. I was going to ask you a question,  Chairperson.
When hon member Maloyi was speaking, he said,  ``Chairperson,  allow  me  to
conclude''. Now what would have happened if the Chairperson  did  not  allow
him to  do  so?  [Laughter.]  What  was  he  going  to  do?  But  since  the
Chairperson gave him time to conclude and he did not give time  to  Mr  Durr
to conclude, I am not sure that there is not some form of discrimination  in
this House.

Can I start with some of the things that Mrs Witbooi spoke  about.  I  think
all of us were moved by her input today. One of the  things  she  said  when
speaking about her own son was that she also  shrank  in  pain  when  people
made jokes about her son's stutter. And that is precisely the  problem.  For
too long those of us who have members of our families who have  disabilities
shrank in pain, instead of standing up and fighting  this  thing.  When  she
did that, she was still young. I think we should stop shrinking in pain,  we
should shriek with anger. We should not allow this to  happen,  not  to  our
own families, not to anybody else we know, and not to anybody  even  in  the
public. I think we have now reached a stage at which it is  possible  to  do
so.

The other specific issue that she raised, which I think needs  some  serious
thought, is the proposal  that  perhaps  a  speech  defect  should  also  be
regarded as a disability. I think, certainly, the Presidency would  want  to
look at that and see what the implications are of that. I  do  believe  that
it is worthwhile looking at, because she is right - sometimes we do not  pay
sufficient attention to that part of it. I thank her very much for  bringing
that to my notice.

I hope Ms Gouws reads more of Mr Raju's speeches. One can tell that he is  a
good speech writer, but he has a better person  to  read  the  speeches  for
him. [Laughter.] He might do it more often - write the speeches and ask  her
to read them.

It is true what Mr Raju said, if he said it and not Ms  Gouws.  There  is  a
lack of reliable information in some respects. What we  are  hoping  for  is
that the new census that we are carrying out will give us  a  more  accurate
picture  about  not  only  the   quantitative   numbers   of   people   with
disabilities, but, to some extent, also the breakdown. This  is  because  if
one looks at the census form correctly, one sees  that  there  are  specific
questions that are asked in the census  form  that  relate  to  people  with
disabilities.

We tried to put the question in such a way that somebody like  me  who  does
have a hearing aid, though I do not have it at the moment, does not  go  and
put himself down as being disabled, because then  the  numbers  will  become
impossible to deal with. We put this in a specific manner in the  hope  that
a great deal more specifically related information  will  come  out  of  the
census over the next two years.

Mr Raju also said that gender equality is high on  the  agenda,  perhaps  we
should do the same for people with disabilities. I prefer to look at  it  in
another way. We should not put up a Chinese wall - whether  we  are  dealing
with the Office on the Rights of the Child, the  Office  on  the  Status  of
Disabled Persons, and the Office on the Status of Women, all three of  which
are in the presidency - and then say there is poverty and underdevelopment.

It is how we take an integrated, cohesive approach that matters, because  if
we can empower an African women who is disabled in a rural area, we will  be
able to deal with all of these questions at  the  same  time.  I  accept  Mr
Raju's approach, with which I have  full  sympathy,  but  I  think  what  is
necessary for us to do is also to concentrate on  seeing  how  we  can  have
this more integrated, cohesive approach to the particular question, so  that
at the same time we are also able, for example, to find ways  and  means  to
strengthen the capacities of the African girl child in the rural areas.

I think that is the kind  of  approach  that  we  should  take.  That  would
inform, it seems to me, the work that the parliamentary portfolio  committee
needs to do. If one brings the things together, then one will have a  better
picture and idea about whether or not even the limited  resources  that  are
allocated for these kinds of specific programmes are actually achieving  the
objectives that were set out. That is quite important for us to do.

Lastly, I agree with the speakers who said that it was  absolutely  critical
that we are very directly involved all the time with regard to dealing  with
issues of conflict  resolution  on  our  continent.  If  we  think  we  have
difficulties and problems with regard to people with disabilities,  we  just
have to go to Mozambique, Angola, Sierra Leone and  the  Congo  to  see  how
much bigger, how much worse this specific problem is in those areas.

The way we want to deal with conflict resolution on the  continent  is  also
to create the conditions in which we do not increase the  number  of  people
with disabilities on our continent. That would apply  to  not  drinking  and
driving over Christmas. I hope the hon member listens to  his  own  message.
[Laughter.] If he listens to his own message we will listen to him. I  thank
the NCOP very much and whenever  the  hon  members  invite  me  they  should
please note that I shall be here. I love this House. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! I wish to  take
this opportunity to recognise our visitors on  the  gallery,  some  of  whom
have disabilities. I wish to say that we are very  grateful  that  they  are
with us and have heard what members have said. Thank you very much.
Before we go on, I have been alerted that Mr Lucas will  read  a  motion  on
this issue.

                  BARRIERS FACING PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, the deputy chairperson, Mr Maloyi,  was  supposed
to do this, but he decided to abandon his duty. [Laughter.] I  move  without
notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the extensive barriers which still exclude persons
       with  disabilities  from   society   and   from   opportunities   for
       development, training, employment and equal participation;


  (2) further notes that these barriers manifest themselves most profoundly
       in the -


       (a)  high percentage of disabled children  of  school-going  age  who
           find themselves outside the formal school system;


       (b)  marginalisation experienced  by  disabled  children  within  the
           formal school system;


       (c)  inaccessibility of most tertiary institutions  to  persons  with
           disability;

                        NATIONAL PARKS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, hon Ministers present  here,  hon  members,  the
National Parks Amendment Bill is supported by all the parties here.  We  are
not going to debate this Bill, but only highlight what it entails.

This Bill seeks to bring the SA National Parks in line with  the  definition
``association not for gain'' contained in paragraph (b)(ii)(cc) of  the  VAT
Act. The Bill also proposes and opens up the possibility for the SA  Revenue
Service to allow  donations  by  taxpayers  to  the  SA  National  Parks  as
deductions from income tax.

This Bill stems from the fact that the SA National Parks  is  registered  as
an enterprise for purposes of the Value-Added Tax Act of 1991. In  terms  of
the VAT Act, the SA  National  Parks  must  pay  VAT  on  any  consideration
received by it  in  relation  to  its  supply  of  goods  or  services.  The
definition of ``consideration'' in the VAT Act includes any payment for  the
supply of goods or services  whether  in  money  or  otherwise  and  whether
voluntarily or not.

This connotation means that according to  the  SA  Revenue  Service  the  SA
National Parks is obliged to pay VAT  on  any  donation  or  sponsorship  it
receives. Therefore, in  terms  of  this  definition  payments  made  as  an
unconditional gift to any ``association not for gain'', as  defined  in  the
VAT Act, are, however, not regarded as ``consideration''.

This Bill, therefore, tries to bring the SA National Parks within the  ambit
and scope of some other society, association or  organisation  with  objects
similar to its own. It does this by providing for donation  or  transfer  of
its assets,  after  liquidation  or  winding  up,  to  some  other  society,
association or organisation with objects not for gain.

All the parties support this amending Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Declaration of vote:

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, although the DP supports the  Bill's  aim  to
bring some parks within the ambit of an ``association not  for  gain'',  the
DP is still deeply concerned about the way in which some parks are  managed.

Dr Robinson started in 1991 with a cash shortage of R22 million. He  retired
six years later, in 1997, and left a surplus of R14,3 million.  During  this
time investments grew from R26,7 million to R100,3 million,  which  means  a
27% rise.

Mr Msimang, who took over from Dr Robinson,  turned  this  cash  surplus  of
R14,3 million into a deficit of R3,8 million in one year. After 3 years  the
deficit stands at  R52,7  million,  which  translates  into  a  R67  million
deficit overall. Investments dropped to R36,8 million, of which ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon member!
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson,  I  think  the  hon  speaker  is
really confused about the declaration by a political party and  a  statement
that should be part of a debate. In terms of the Rules what she  is  stating
is certainly inappropriate for a  declaration  by  a  political  party.  She
should address, in a declaration, the aspects in the  Bill  that  the  party
supports or has reservations about. But, certainly,  she  cannot  come  here
and make a speech or provide details on things  that  we  are  not  familiar
with.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I am sure the  hon  member  has
understood that.

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Yes, I have, but  I  have  said  what  I  wanted  to  say.
[Laughter.]

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                       MEDICAL SCHEMES AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)
The MINISTER  OF  HEALTH:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  thank  you  for  the
opportunity to present the  Medical  Schemes  Amendment  Bill.  The  central
purpose of this Bill is to further  regulate  an  industry  on  which  large
numbers of our people depend for essential health services.

As with most pieces of regulatory law, this  Bill  has  been  contested  and
debated quite hotly on its route to this House. I believe that  the  process
has refined the Bill and made it a  better  piece  of  legislation.  I  also
believe that the legislation remains true to its original  intention,  which
is to encourage private provision of health services for those  sections  of
our society who can afford to purchase it by building  safeguards  into  the
system and ensuring it works better for the beneficiaries.

Many members will recall the hard battle we fought  to  pass  the  principal
Act, that is the Medical Schemes Act, in 1998.  At  that  time  the  medical
schemes  industry  was  experiencing  significant  cost   escalations,   and
coverage of the elderly and sick was in decline.  The  financial  regulation
of schemes was also weak and the financial  stability  of  many  schemes  in
doubt. The time was  long  overdue  for  Government  to  step  in  and  take
responsibility for the  sector,  recognising  that  health  care  is  not  a
commodity that can be left purely to the dynamics of the marketplace.

The principal Act  aimed  to  achieve  four  main  objectives,  that  is  to
reintroduce community rating  in  medical  schemes;  to  improve  access  to
medical schemes for people  who  were  previously  excluded;  to  mandate  a
prescribed minimum benefit package to ensure that all members had  essential
hospital cover; and to improve financial management and  governance  of  the
schemes.

The Act was not universally popular and its critics predicted that it  would
result in further cost escalations and a  reduction  in  scheme  membership,
which would threaten the future of many medical schemes.

Although the Act has only been in operation since January  2000,  I  believe
that there are already signs that our critics overreacted at the  time.  The
audited returns provided to the Council for Medical  Schemes  are  beginning
to show the early impact of the Act. Firstly, membership of medical  schemes
has not decreased despite economic conditions that  are  not  favourable  to
the growth of this sector.

While we would like to have seen a substantial increase in numbers, we  have
had to content ourselves with the fact that the proportion of  members  from
vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, has shown some growth.

It is difficult to say precisely which features of the  1998  Act  had  this
effect, but it is likely that the amnesty provision played a very  important
part. This allowed members to join schemes  at  an  advanced  stage  without
higher premiums being imposed. Of course  the  success  of  our  legislation
must be measured not only in terms of the growth in membership, but also  in
the composition of membership.

The viability of  medical  schemes  lies  in  the  notion  of  cross-subsidy
between members who are young and healthy, and those who are older and  have
a much greater need of health care. We need to monitor the  ability  of  the
sector to attract younger members in the period ahead.

One of the more troubling trends revealed by  the  audited  returns  is  the
fact that a sharp rise in administration costs is the  main  factor  in  the
overall increase in medical schemes' spending. In 2000 administration  costs
grew  by  26%,  while  claims  went  up  by  just   6%.   Furthermore,   the
administration costs are much higher in the open schemes than in the  closed
schemes where membership is tied to employment in  a  particular  sector  or
business organisation. This  is  certainly  a  trend  that  is  not  in  the
interests of members and that also requires careful monitoring.

On the good news front, the average solvency  ratio  of  schemes  is  at  an
encouraging 20,5%, twice the statutory minimum of 10%. But,  again,  we  see
significantly different  patterns  in  the  open  schemes  from  those  that
prevail in the closed schemes, with the  closed  schemes  having  much  more
substantial reserves.

The solvency level for open schemes presented  a  mixed  picture.  While  it
averaged at 13% last year, about one third of these schemes were  below  the
statutory requirement. We are monitoring  the  situation  extremely  closely
with a view to possible intervention.

Experience with the Act has not only vindicated our  own  policy  positions,
but also taught us some very  valuable  lessons.  The  amending  Bill  I  am
presenting to hon members today is a response to some of these lessons,  not
the least of these lessons being insight  into  the  nature  of  regulation.
When it comes to medical schemes we have a vested interest in their  healthy
growth and their stability. Regulation with development is the  notion  that
guides our actions. We would regard  our  endeavours  as  a  failure  if  we
achieved clear administration  and  good  consumer  practices,  but  stifled
growth in the sector.
With this in mind, we approached the question of regulation  with  the  view
that self-regulation is first and foremost  desirable.   Government  control
and punitive action should be held in reserve as the ultimate  sanction.  We
have tried to embody this essence in the Bill I am about to present.
The Bill itself seeks to strengthen the Medical Schemes Act  of  1998  in  a
number of ways. Firstly, it seeks to improve  protection  for  members.  The
most  significant  portion  of  amendments  regarding  reinsurance,  waiting
periods and marketing of medical schemes are all intended to enhance  member
protection. Secondly, it seeks to enable the regulator, that is the  Council
for Medical Schemes, to take a proactive rather than a reactive approach  in
dealing with medical schemes.

Thirdly, the  Bill  seeks  to  promote  efficient  administration  and  good
governance of medical schemes by,  among  other  things,  insisting  on  the
independence of individuals in key positions.  The  Bill  also  reduces  red
tape by allowing schemes to make more routine decisions  without  having  to
revert to the council for approval.  As  is  the  case  with  most  amending
legislation, the Bill also tidies up definitions  and  clumsy  phrasing  and
eliminates duplication.

It is impossible in the time allotted to cover every detail  of  what  is  a
fairly technical piece of legislation. So I am going to highlight  only  the
most significant provisions. I  will  begin  with  the  thorny  question  of
reinsurance. This has been the most contentious  and  the  most  challenging
issue we have had to address in this year. I must say  that  the  extent  of
the opposition we have had to face in addressing this issue  has  been  most
worrying, when one considers the magnitude of problems that we uncovered  in
examining this practice of medical schemes.

The view that we have taken is that reinsurance can be a very valuable  tool
in protecting schemes in times of financial difficulty,  but  it  cannot  be
applied  as  a  one-size-fits-all  solution   for   all   medical   schemes.
Ultimately, every member who contributes to a medical scheme has  the  right
not to be charged an artificially inflated premium. Every member  should  be
free of the risk that the  scheme's  solvency  is  compromised  because  the
trustees have  not  exercised  due  care  in  entering  into  a  reinsurance
contract.

Health  care  coverage  in  this  country,  as  we  all  know,  is   already
prohibitively expensive, and we cannot afford any  unjustified  expenditure.
Experience has taught us that reinsurance  requires  careful  evaluation  to
ensure that the interests  of  members  are  not  in  any  way  compromised.
Although some medical schemes have taken the  view  that  the  registrar  of
medical schemes should not interfere in the scheme's decision  to  reinsure,
we insist that the practice must fall under his or her watchful eye.

After much debate, we have agreed on a formulation that not  only  satisfies
our policy concerns, but  also  addresses  the  concerns  expressed  by  the
industry about the need to strengthen the  powers  and  responsibilities  of
medical schemes' trustees.

Our approach is a more proactive  one,  which  would  prevent  inappropriate
reinsurance arrangements  rather  than  simply  seeking  to  deal  with  the
consequences  of  such  arrangements.  The  final  formulation  allows   the
registrar to keep track of all insurance contracts  and  to  raise  concerns
when such contracts are not in the best interests of schemes' members.

However, the final decision on whether or not to reinsure  is  left  in  the
hands of the board of trustees who, after  all,  must  take  full  fiduciary
responsibility for the financial position of their schemes. The  interaction
between the registrar and the trustees is indeed a process in which the  two
parties complement each other and  where  the  expertise  of  the  registrar
serves as a resource for the trustees.

On  the  question  of  waiting  periods,  we  have  had  very   constructive
discussions with the industry.  The  intention  of  waiting  periods  is  to
protect schemes against adverse selection, that is  opportunistic  behaviour
by some medical scheme members who may delay joining  a  scheme  until  they
require expensive medical treatment and  then,  having  had  the  treatment,
simply leave the scheme afterwards.

Unfortunately, the formulation in the principal Act has had some  unintended
consequences in which some schemes have used it to  impose  waiting  periods
on members who are not necessarily engaging in opportunistic  behaviour.  To
address this, we have inserted two definitions of  waiting  periods  in  the
amending Bill and these stipulate the circumstances  in  which  general  and
condition-specific  waiting  periods  may  be  imposed  on   members.    The
underlying principle is to consider the member's history  of  membership  in
other schemes, and to use this as a basis for  determining  whether  waiting
periods may apply.

In addition, the Bill stipulates that members who change schemes because  of
a change in employment or because their employer changes or  terminates  the
scheme, may not face waiting periods. The provisions aim to  strike  a  fair
balance between protecting schemes from  adverse  selection  and  protecting
new members from inappropriate use of waiting periods.

The impact of brokers on the stability of medical schemes is another  matter
we have been concerned about. Although the principal Act placed a  limit  on
the remuneration of brokers, there is evidence to suggest that this area  of
regulation needs tightening up. Some schemes have  experienced  a  situation
in which members shift between schemes without any clear gains in  terms  of
benefits. The question therefore arises whether perverse incentives  enjoyed
by brokers are responsible for this  unnecessary  movement  that  pushes  up
administration costs.

For this reason, the Bill enhances the powers of the  Minister  to  regulate
the conduct and remuneration of  brokers.  The  Bill  also  strengthens  the
consumer's protection by restricting the marketing  of  medical  schemes  to
those individuals and entities  that  are  actually  registered  as  medical
schemes in terms of the  Act.  It  also  prohibits  conditional  selling  of
medical scheme products in terms of which members are  coerced  into  buying
other products in order to be allowed to join particular medical schemes.
The consumer is further protected by additional powers that are assigned  to
the Minister in terms of the Bill.  These  include  the  power  to  regulate
managed health care contracts and to impose penalties on medical schemes  or
administrators for late payment of claims. The latter  will  strike  a  cord
with many health care providers who have struggled to  get  payment  out  of
the schemes.

Managed health care appears to have yielded mixed results  in  our  country.
Our own experience  and  the  nature  of  the  complaints  received  by  the
regulator suggest that there is still much work that needs  to  be  done  in
this area. At provincial level, we need to  increase  our  understanding  of
the potential impact of managed health care on our public hospitals.

In the area of promoting  good  governance  of  medical  schemes,  the  Bill
firmly introduces the clause  on  ensuring  the  independence  of  principal
officers, trustees  and  auditors  of  medical  schemes.  It  does  this  by
prohibiting  any  broker,  or  any   person   employed   by   the   scheme's
administrators, from taking on any of these positions. It  further  promotes
transparency and ensures the independence  of  trustees  by  requiring  that
trustees  disclose,  on  an  annual  basis,  any  remuneration  or  benefits
accruing to them.

The complexity of the medical schemes' environment has brought  home  to  us
the need to pre-empt problems, rather than try  to  remedy  them  after  the
fact.  For  this  purpose,  the  Bill  empowers  the  registrar  to  request
financial statements from the scheme  as  frequently  as  once  every  three
months, and to determine the degree  of  urgency  that  applies  in  getting
responses to her or his queries.

It is also vital that the registrar has the power to  order  inspections  of
schemes in order to monitor compliance with the Act but  we  recognise  that
the registrar's powers in this regard must be balanced with  the  rights  of
the trustees to exercise full responsibility for  their  schemes.  For  this
reason, we have tried to reverse those instances in the principal Act  where
we have overregulated. For instance, medical schemes are no longer  required
to get prior approval from the Council  for  Medical  Schemes  in  order  to
undertake a number of fairly routine activities.

I view the passing of this Bill by the NCOP as a vote of confidence  in  our
vision of a national health system in which the private and  public  sectors
have complementary roles to play in increasing access  to  health  care  for
all.

We all have a responsibility to build this nation so that  the  promises  of
our future eclipse the shame of our past. One critical way of doing this  is
to assert our  common  humanity  through  providing  caring  and  supporting
social services, including, of course, health services for all. To do  this,
we must control the overall cost of health care and ensure that  the  burden
of this cost is spread fairly amongst all of us.

Our free services must be reserved for the large number  of  extremely  poor
people who cannot afford to  buy  health  care.  Reasonable  and  affordable
options must be available for those who  cannot  purchase  health  services.
This Bill, therefore, has implications for the nation as a  whole,  and  not
simply for those who provide or subscribe to medical schemes.

A year ago South Africans were  generally  ashamed  when  the  World  Health
Organisation put our country near the  bottom  of  a  global  log  table  on
health care. What the World Health Organisation  was  saying  was  that  our
services represented very poor value for money, not  that  the  care  itself
was substandard. It will take much more than this Bill to elevate us in  the
WHO rankings, but every action in the right direction counts and we  believe
that passing this Bill today is a significant step in the right direction.

I would like to thank the Department of Health and the Council  for  Medical
Schemes for the sterling work they have put  in  to  prepare  this  amending
Bill. I must also acknowledge the contributions made by the medical  schemes
and  other  industry  stakeholders  in  improving  some   of   the   earlier
formulations. On this evidence, I am convinced that  we  are  equal  to  the
task that lies ahead and that, ultimately, we will create a national  health
system which extends quality care to all our citizens.

I feel confident that the NCOP will give its  full  support  to  this  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, hon  Ministers  and  colleagues,  I  rise  on
behalf of the chairperson of the Select Committee on  Social  Services,  Mrs
Loretta Jacobus, who is unable to be here today.

It is not a mere coincidence that this amending Bill follows  quite  closely
on the heels of the principal Act. The national  Department  of  Health  saw
fit, as is their brief, to keep an eye on what were groundbreaking  policies
in the medical schemes industry, that is  the  Medical  Schemes  Act,  1998.
What they found there prompted the drafting of this amending Bill.
Firstly, I would like to compliment the department on their  quick  response
to  a  potentially  volatile  situation.  However,  the  response  from  the
industry has been mostly lukewarm. They once again raised the issue  of  the
industry being  undermined  by  what  they  perceived  to  be  too  frequent
regulatory intervention and unyielding authorities.

We  all  remember  the  harsh  criticism  that  was  levelled  against   the
department at the time of the passing of the  principal  Act.  The  gist  of
this  criticism  accused  the  Government  of  single-handedly  bringing  an
industry to its knees, but contrary to the predictions of doom, the  medical
scheme industry is still alive and well today.

What Government has never backed away from, is ensuring that health care  in
the public sector and the private  sector  is  affordable,  transparent  and
nondiscriminatory and that those administering the services  to  the  public
do so with a social conscience. In private health care, I believe  that  the
Government is fully prepared to give prior  consideration  to  affordability
rather than profit.
The ideal would, of course, have been a mandatory  social  health  insurance
system that is affordable and accessible to all. But in the absence of  such
a state-owned and maintained social health insurance system, we  will  still
have to ensure that our people have the best services possible and  are  not
ripped off by unscrupulous members of the medical schemes industry, bent  on
profits above human and health needs.

We are here today because the national department has  been  inundated  with
information pointing out violations on the ground and how  some  sectors  of
the industry abused the principal Act for financial  gain  through  perverse
incentives.

The amendments as refined by the parliamentary committees therefore seek  to
redress some negative fallout that has crept into the industry.

The five steps taken have already been mentioned by  the  hon  the  Minister
and I will not repeat them. I am sure that the hon Ms  Jacobus  would  agree
to that.
When this Bill was being  discussed  in  the  committee  stage  all  parties
supported  it,  except  of  course  the  usual  objectors,  namely  the  DP.
Therefore the Select Committee on Social  Services  endorses  this  amending
Bill as submitted. [Applause.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, the main objectives  of  the  amendments  are  to
regulate the practice of reinsurance, regulate waiting  periods  and  expand
the powers of the registrar.  These  should  be  in  the  interests  of  the
consumers, but it appears  that  the  service  providers  are  going  to  be
prejudiced by overregulation.

Bearing in mind the increased burden on the public health  sector  and  that
healthy private-public partnerships are vital to a healthy  nation,  the  DP
supports the amendments in principle, with the  notable  exceptions  of  the
amendments in the proposed section 29A ad section 29(c).

The amendments in the proposed  new  section  29A  focus  on  the  issue  of
waiting periods. It  prejudices  most  medical  schemes  and  removes  vital
protection  against  adverse  selection.  No  provision  is  made  to   curb
voluntary scheme-hopping by the opportunistic consumer.

Clause 29(5)(c) is prescriptive  and  challenges  the  constitutionality  of
legal contracts. There is very little acknowledgement of the positive  value
of legitimate reinsurance to the consumer.

The ever-growing power of the council and the registrar is  concerning.  The
proposed amendment to the Medical Schemes Act has far-reaching  implications
for all concerned. Thank you, however, to the council and the Department  of
Health for properly consulting all relevant stakeholders.

The DP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, hon Minister, the  medical  schemes  industry  of
South Africa is an important industry and  is  playing  a  pivotal  role  in
making the delivery of health services in South Africa possible.

For many reasons it is an industry that is in a status of flux and  requires
clarity to operate effectively during periods of change. Important to me  as
a medical doctor, is the protection of  the  interests  of  members  of  the
public. In an attempt to do so, the Bill addresses different issues.

Firstly, to protect the interests of the beneficiaries, inter  alia,  clause
7 prohibits medical  schemes  from  discriminating  on  the  basis  of  age.
Secondly, this Bill prohibits the marketing of unregistered schemes, and  in
future it will be an offence to market or promote any entity  without  being
registered as a medical scheme.

Clause 14  allows  the  registrar  to  request  financial  statements  on  a
quarterly basis from the board of trustees. This will  protect  the  members
of medical aids which  get  into  financial  trouble  against  the  schemes'
closing down unexpectedly and leaving members uncovered.

One of the greatest problems that medical schemes are  experiencing  at  the
moment is that their administration costs are increasing  dramatically.  One
of the many reasons could be the fact that patients  abuse  the  schemes  in
many ways, inter alia by waiting until they are very ill  before  joining  a
medical scheme, the so-called adverse selection, as  the  hon  the  Minister
has already mentioned.

Clause 10 of the Bill provides for waiting periods. Medical schemes can  now
impose a general waiting period of three months and a  condition,  namely  a
specific waiting period of 12 months, for patients suffering  from  specific
chronic ailments, upon a person who  applies  for  membership.  This  could,
however, be seen as unfair and  discriminating  and  the  implementation  of
this clause will be easier said than done.

The reinsurance issue has been dealt with by the Minister comprehensively.

My party sincerely hopes that this amendment Bill will bring more  stability
to the medical scheme industry. I believe that if that happens, at  the  end
of the day the beneficiary will benefit the most.

The New NP, in spite of some reservations, do support the Bill.

I request all members of this  House  to  please  not  abuse  their  medical
scheme. Do not cut the throat  of  the  goose  that  lays  the  golden  egg.
[Applause.]

illnesses that need to be paid for regularly,  like  chronic  diseases.  The
problem occurs when a member is told by the scheme that there  is  no  money
for a particular illness, therefore he must pay for  himself.  Sometimes  he
is told to pay, because he will be refunded  when  he  brings  the  doctor's
letter. This becomes a problem to a member, because money  is  always  taken
from his salary to take care of such things. When one is  told  to  pay,  it
becomes difficult, especially if one has been making contributions.

Another thing that gives members of medical aid schemes problems, is when  a
scheme gives a small amount  of  money  which  does  not  cover  a  member's
needs.]

This amending Bill has been hailed as a means of  bringing  affordable  care
to the poor, but from the look of things it is going to be a  hard  blow  to
the contributor, who will pay more, but get less benefits.  At  the  present
moment our medical scheme allocates R5 000 for optical care, but only  gives
members 50% of this  allowance,  regardless  of  the  reason  given.  It  is
therefore more profit-centred than patient or client-centred.

The IFP feels that there has been insufficient consultation  regarding  this
Bill. There are  financial  aspects  which  may  lead  to  unexpected  nasty
problems in future, and which could have been  avoided  before  passing  the
Bill.

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, hon Ministers present in the House,  the  Bill
before this House seeks to assist members of  medical  aid  schemes  to  get
value  for  their  money  by  extending  some  of  their  rights  to   their
dependants.

In  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  country's  Constitution  for
nondiscrimination on whatever grounds,  the  Bill  prohibits  discrimination
against clients on the grounds of age. Gone are  the  days  when  a  medical
scheme could declare that its membership is open to members up to a  certain
age, thus excluding the older people. Members of the board  of  trustees  of
the medical schemes would henceforth be neutral people  in  order  to  guard
against conflicts of interest.

In these hard times we notice the proliferation of medical schemes, some  of
which are dubious. Clause 6 of the Bill seeks  to  curb  these  unscrupulous
vultures by providing protection to consumers.

Since I have only one and a half minutes at my disposal, I only want to  add
that the UCDP supports the Bill. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, I would like to  thank  all  those  who
have participated in this debate on  the  Medical  Schemes  Amendment  Bill.
Thank you very much for supporting it. What surprised me is  that  the  ACDP
did not participate in this debate. I do not  know  whether  supporting  the
Bill is an end of the year present for me. As a matter of fact, Mr  Durr  is
not even here.

Let me just say I do not think I should go into a lengthy  discussion  about
this debate, because the principal Act itself was debated at  length.  I  do
not know for whom Ms Gouws has been speaking, because, as  I  mentioned,  we
have really  had  very  constructive  discussions  with  the  industry,  the
providers therefore, on all the  aspects.  But  I  want  to  thank  her  for
nevertheless supporting the Bill. I think it is also  an  end  of  the  year
present for me.

I would like to thank everybody.

Ngithanda ukusho kuNkk  Vilakazi  ukuthi  ngibona  ukuthi  akawufundisisanga
kahle lo  mThetho-sivivinywa  ngoba  into  ozama  ukuyenza  ukukhusela  bona

ukuba amalungu ama-medical aid schemes. Iyona njongo-ke leyo  yalo  mThetho-
sivivinywa.

Ngiyethemba-ke ukuthi abantu abangamalungu e-IFP bayavumelana  nathi  ukuthi
kuyaqala ngqa  eNingizimu  Afrika  ukuthi  sibavulele  ithuba  lokuthi  nabo

leliya lungu lizame-ke ukuwufundisisa ngempela lo mThetho-sivivinywa.

Ngenkathi  siwudingida  ngale  emKhandlwini  kaZwelonke,  bavumelana   nathi

osekukudala behlupheka  emphakathini  nasemindenini  yabo.  (Translation  of
Zulu paragraphs follows.)
[I would like to mention to Mrs Vilakazi that I think she did not  read  the
Bill well, because it aims at protecting the people she was referring to  as
powerless, poor, and experiencing hardship and people who  are  eligible  to
be members of medical aid schemes. That is the aim of this Bill.

I hope IFP members agree with us that it is the first time in  South  Africa
that we are giving them an opportunity to  become  members  of  medical  aid
schemes. I would like to ask that hon member to read the Bill carefully.

When we discussed it in the National Assembly, members  of  the  IFP  agreed
with us, except Rabinowitz. We even  asked  her  on  whose  behalf  she  was
speaking, because  as  far  as  we  know  this  Bill  protects  all  people,
including those who, according to members of Parliament, are being  excluded
by us.

It is the purpose of this Bill that we should  try  always  to  improve  the
level of our people who have been experiencing hardship  for  quite  a  long
time.]

Thank you very much for supporting the Bill.

Ngifuna ukusho ukuthi  sesifike  esikhathini  lapho  iPhalamende  lizosukuma
livale kulo leli sonto.  Lokho  kuzosipha  ithuba  lokuthi  siye  kophumula.
Kodwa, ngaphambi kokuba siphumule kufuneka sikhumbule ukuthi  kufuneka  siye
kubantu  esibamele  siyothi  ukusebenza  kancane.   Ukuphumula   ngesikhathi
sikaKhisimuzi  noncibijane  kusho  ukuthi  sizothola  ithuba  lokuthi   sibe
nezihlobo zethu  nabangani  bethu,  sithakase  futhi  sijabule.  Obesekusele
ukuthi mina ngifisele  amalungu  uKhisimuzi  omuhle  nokuthi  unyaka  omusha
awuqale ngendlela efaneleyo. Sesiyobonana ngonyaka  ozayo.  Ngiyawethembisa-
ke  amalungu  ukuthi  ngaleso  sikhathi  ngiyobe   sengiwugogo   okwesibili.
[Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[I would like to say that we have now reached the time that Parliament  will
close this week. That will give us an opportunity to  rest.  But  before  we
rest, we should go back to people whom we are representing and do some  work
for them. To rest during Christmas and New Year means that we will  get  the
opportunity to meet with our friends and relatives,  and  be  happy.  Now  I
need to wish members of Parliament a happy Christmas and to  start  the  new
year in a proper way. See you next year and I promise you, by  that  time  I
will be a granny for the second time. [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                  PRIVATE SECURITY INDUSTRY REGULATION BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson, hon  members,  when
the new democratic Government was elected in 1994, it clearly expressed  its
commitment to addressing broad issues relating to  transformation.  As  part
of this transformation  process,  the  need  to  review  legislation  passed
during the apartheid era was identified in  order  to  bring  South  African
legislation  into  line  with  the   new   democratic   and   constitutional
dispensation which we have today.

One of the legislative reforms was the  passing  of  the  Security  Officers
Amendment Act of 1997, which required the Minister of  Safety  and  Security
to reform the regulatory framework of  the  private  security  industry.  In
terms of that amending Act the Minister was required to draft  a  new  Bill,
and it is this Bill that we have before  us  and  that  we  are  considering
today.

As part of drafting the new Bill, various sectors were taken  into  account,
including the fact that the existing  Security  Officers  Act  of  1987  had
become outdated, given the changes  in  the  nature  of  the  industry.  The
industry has changed significantly and is no longer confined solely  to  the
guarding and  protection  of  persons  and  premises.   These  changes  have
resulted from, one, the growth and  proliferation  of  new  sectors  of  the
private security industry, such as  the  providers  of  security  equipment,
private investigators and technologically advanced service  providers;  two,
the capacity of private security  companies  to  obtain  arms  legally,  and
three, concerns that the industry possibly contains some elements  who  have
the potential to engage in abuses and the implications  of  such  abuse  for
the security of the state.

The industry has shown phenomenal growth. According to  statistics  supplied
by the Security Officers' Interim Board, there  were  in  excess  of  6  000
active private security businesses registered with the  board  by  the  year
2000. Of these, 3  232  were  active  registered  guarding  businesses,  609
active registered  cash-in-transit  businesses  and  878  active  registered
armed  response  businesses.  It  has  been   estimated   that   there   are
approximately 652 persons involved in private  investigations,  and  844  in
other categories.

During this period, there  were  approximately  165  314  active  registered
security guards employed by the  industry.  This  figure  excluded  security
guards employed  as  in-house  security  personnel  who  are  not  currently
registered  as  security  guards.  The  estimates  for   in-house   security
personnel varied from 60 000 to  200  000.  The  Private  Security  Industry
Regulation Bill now brings in-house security providers under the  regulatory
framework.

A further consideration was that the industry was fraught  with  infighting,
competing interests and allegations of wrongdoing. There  was  a  perception
that the inclusion of representatives of employers and  employees  from  the
private security industry in the regulatory  board  did  not  contribute  to
proper  and  effective  regulation  because  of  the  vested  and  competing
interests. This had serious implications for the credibility of  the  board.
All these  concerns  needed  to  be  addressed,  and  the  Private  Security
Industry regulation Bill has been crafted to do this.

The Bill expands on the objects  and  functions  of  the  future  Regulatory
authority, to enable it to regulate the industry and to  exercise  effective
control over security service providers, both  in  the  public  and  in  the
national interest, as well as in  the  interest  of  the  security  industry
itself. The future regulatory authority is  tasked  to  encourage  ownership
and  control  of  security  businesses  by  persons  who  are   historically
disadvantaged, as well as to promote their empowerment and advancement.

In addressing the need for proper and effective regulation of the  industry,
the Government felt very strongly that those  entrusted  with  the  task  of
regulating the  industry  should  not  have  any  interest  in  the  private
security industry. The reasons for this are obvious.

Indeed, the Bill provides for such a regulatory  authority  which  will  act
through a council that is independent of the  industry.  The  Government  is
convinced  that  such  independence  will  contribute  immensely  to  better
regulation in the interests of all concerned.  However,  the  voice  of  the
industry will not be ignored. Indeed, provision to listen to the  voices  of
the private industry through committees which the council  is  empowered  to
appoint, is captured in the Bill. In cases of need  the  council  will  have
access to the inputs and expertise of the representatives from  the  private
security industry through such committees.

National security and the protection  of  the  individual  are  the  highest
priorities of any responsible government. The Government  is  acutely  aware
of the sensitive nature of the private security industry  and  the  need  to
avoid  and  eliminate  the  dangers  associated  with  the  involvement   of
irresponsible persons  in  the  industry  and  that  includes  international
criminal syndicates, which in some cases have used the security industry  as
a cover for their nefarious activities.

It is in this context that the Bill provides for strict entry  requirements.
One of the entry requirements is that any person who wants to be  registered
as a security service provider must be a citizen of  South  Africa  or  have
permanent resident status in South Africa.

Since the advent of our new democratic order and our  country's  entry  into
the international community of  nations  as  well  as  the  implications  of
globalisation there has been a renewed interest on the  part  of  foreigners
in investing in various business ventures in  South  Africa,  including  the
private security sector. This interest manifested itself  in  the  past  few
months when several  South  Africa  businesses  were  purchased  by  foreign
businesses for individual amounts ranging from  approximately  R400  million
to R630 million each.

The decision to allow foreign investment in the security  sector  does  not,
in any way, compromise the security of our  country,  given  the  fact  that
there are sufficient safeguards in the Bill itself to ensure  that  this  is
the case. The decision allows the use of capital and expertise from  foreign
sources to the best advantage of South Africa as a whole. The  advantage  of
such foreign shareholding  and  investment  would  be  the  bringing  in  of
skills, expertise and technological know-how, which will  benefit  not  only
the security industry, but also the broader South African economy.

In addition, one such obvious spin-off of the foreign  shareholding  element
will be the enhancement of black economic empowerment. As a matter of  fact,
this specific issue was widely canvassed by the department and  the  leading
companies from abroad that are currently involved in the industry. There  is
no doubt that this commitment by these companies  will  translate  into  the
consolidation of the emerging black businesses in this sector.  Indeed,  the
future regulatory authority has, as indicated earlier, the important  object
of encouraging ownership and control of security businesses by  historically
disadvantaged persons and promoting the empowerment and advancement of  such
persons. This aspect of the transformation and empowerment  agenda  must  be
vigorously pursued.

As part of the protection  of  our  national  interests,  the  Bill  further
provides that any applicant who is a former member of any military  security
police or intelligence force or service in South Africa  or  elsewhere  must
submit  a  prescribed  clearance  certificate  from  his  or  her   previous
employer. It does, also, clearly prohibit persons who are  employed  by  the
SAPS,  the  SANDF,  the  Scorpions,  NIA,  the  secret   service   and   the
Correctional Services  from  moonlighting  as  security  service  providers.
Moonlighting is frowned upon and will be a criminal offence.

The Bill further provides for a  code  of  conduct  for  both  the  security
service providers and the inspectors. The inspectors have been given  powers
to ensure that security service providers comply with  the  requirements  of
the Bill. The private security industry has  acquired  capabilities  and  is
undertaking operations  which  may  infringe  on  every  person's  right  to
privacy and as such infringe upon  constitutional  rights.  These  practices
need to be limited by regulation so as to ensure that the  rights  enshrined
in the Constitution continue to be  protected.  We  are  referring  here  to
things such as the tapping of people's telephones and so on, which  some  of
these security companies are capable of.

I am confident that the Bill contains sufficient provisions to regulate  the
private security industry in the interest of all  stakeholders.  Whilst  the
regulatory authority is tasked to regulate and control the private  security
industry, the authority itself will not be above  scrutiny.  The  regulatory
authority will be accountable to the Minister and ultimately to  Parliament.


The process of drafting this  Bill  has  been  a  very  difficult  one.  The
contributions from all concerned have been very useful  and  appreciated.  I
want to take this opportunity to thank the various people  who  assisted  in
this process,  including  the  chairperson  of  the  select  committee,  the
members of the select committee and the national secretariat and  the  legal
division of the SA Police Service, as well  as  the  interdepartmental  work
group which contributed to developing the policy which  informed  the  Bill.
[Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, many of  us  have  seen  the  best  of  our
presiding officers and the Chief Whip in  this  Chamber.  Some  of  us  were
fortunate enough to see the best of them last night.  It  was  a  marvel  to
watch. [Interjections.]
The Ellis Park soccer disaster on 11 April 2001 has taught  us  a  very  big
lesson. The commission of inquiry led by Judge  Ngoepe  is  busy  trying  to
find out exactly what took place before the actual disaster on that  fateful
night. Lawyers are at each other's throats, trying to clear their clients.

The question which is being  asked  by  the  commission  is:  Which  private
security company was in charge that day? There was more  than  one  security
company in charge of security that night. They were there to make sure  that
those soccer fans were safe. They were happy to be there.

But immediately after that disaster, no  security  company  wanted  to  take
responsibility for what had happened. The commission is trying very hard  to
know which security company was in charge of security. Of course, it is  not
going to be easy for the commission to establish who was responsible.

Why is it so difficult? It is so because at present security  companies  are
not properly registered  or  not  registered  at  all.  They  are  not  even
regulated. In some instances, there is  no  record  as  to  how  many  staff
members are there, and who are managing that company. The  Private  Security
Industry Regulation Bill seeks to solve some of these problems.

The Bill provides for the registration  of  security  offices  and  for  the
inspection  of  security  service  providers.  It  establishes  a   security
industry  regulation  authority  to  regulate  the  security  industry.  The
Government's concern in this industry is  basically  that  once  people  are
engaged in the business of providing security and are making  money  out  of
the provision of security to others, they need some form of regulation.

As members might be aware, the definition of ``security service''  has  been
broadened  to  include  categories  such  as  in-house   security,   private
investigators and locksmiths. This is significant because  security  service
providers must register in order to provide services.  Failure  to  register
means that they practise illegally. Broadening the  definition  of  security
service providers increases the categories of people that must register  and
therefore increases the categories of  people  that  will  be  regulated  in
terms of the Bill.

There is a transitional clause in the Bill that allows for  the  phasing  in
of regulation of different categories of service providers.

The Bill  also  establishes  an  independent  security  industry  regulatory
authority to exercise effective control over the practices of  the  security
service providers. The numbers quoted by  the  Deputy  Minister  shows  that
private security personnel outnumber the police by a ratio of  approximately
4 to 1. This justifies strongly why strict regulation is necessary.

I think we should acknowledge the positive role played by  private  security
in  combating  crime.  In  many  shopping  centres,  industrial   areas   or
residential areas, the use of  security  companies  has  increased  as  have
their personnel and their operations.  When  merely  walking  from  here  to
Regis House one is likely to meet no fewer  than  five  different  uniformed
guards or security personnel. Are they registered?

The Bill introduces the council for the authority. Members who are going  to
serve in this body must demonstrate that they are  not  connected  with  the
private security industry. The  role  of  the  council  is  to  oversee  and
control the function of the authority. There will be other structures  which
will assist in the smooth running of the industry.

This Bill will, in a way, solve the problem of the  fly-by-night  operators.
These companies have no plans, no  offices  and  no  constitution,  and  are
often run by a husband and wife team. They use their bedroom as  an  office.
Their planning and their meetings are held in their  bedrooms  after  hours.
Obviously, this kind of arrangement cannot be tolerated. That is the  reason
why the regulation requirements have been expanded and broadened  to  ensure
stricter entry.

One other issue which causes some discomfort to  some  stakeholders  is  the
fact that the code  of  conduct  is  legally  binding  to  security  service
providers whether registered or not. As long as security  service  providers
are paid after providing a service, they have to be regulated. They have  to
be bound by that code of conduct.  We  cannot  give  them  a  blank  cheque,
particularly in our time.

Many of us have a problem with foreigners  who  own  security  companies  in
South Africa. There is no way a foreigner can  protect  our  people  without
being  in  partnership  with  local  citizens.  We  need  their  skills  and
expertise. Very few countries, if any, would allow a  foreigner  to  protect
the other country's citizens without the involvement of the local people.

In this Bill we allow  foreigners  to  be  shareholders  in  these  security
companies. This is done to dispel the myth that  this  Bill  is  against  or
will discourage foreign investment. Any person outside the borders  of  this
country  can  operate  in  this  country  as  long  as  they  meet  all  the
requirements.

Having removed all these uncertainties, I, Mathupa Mokoena, cannot  see  any
tangible reason why this Bill cannot be supported.

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, I am reading this speech on behalf  of  the  hon
Lawrence Lever. For reasons that are all too familiar  to  us,  the  private
security industry has become a major industry in  our  economy  and  employs
more people than the SA Police Service.

The private security industry has not been without its controversies.  There
were  the  abuses  in  training  and  certification  procedures  that   were
publicised in the nation's media. An element  in  the  industry  abused  its
workers and paid them less than the minimum wage, and there  were  a  number
of  other  unscrupulous  practices.  Fly-by-night  operators   plagued   the
industry. Everyone agrees that the industry needs to be properly regulated.

Unfortunately, the  passage  of  this  Bill  itself  through  the  portfolio
committee in the National Assembly was  not  without  its  controversies.  I
refer here to the provisions that, in effect, would  have  excluded  foreign
investors from this industry. These provisions were initially placed in  the
Bill, despite the fact that  as  a  nation  we  are  desperately  trying  to
attract  foreign  direct  investment  to  alleviate  the  plight  of   those
suffering as a result of the pressing problem of structural unemployment  in
our economy.

Fortunately, by the time the Bill reached the select committee,  sanity  had
prevailed and this prohibition had been removed from this  Bill.  There  is,
however,  no  telling  how  much  damage  the  mere  suggestion  of  such  a
prohibition  had  on  our  nation's  campaign  to  attract  foreign   direct
investment.

There are, however, still problems with this Bill. The  industry  is  to  be
regulated by a regulatory authority. This  regulatory  authority  is  to  be
governed and controlled by a council, which is to be  set  up  in  terms  of
clause 6 of the Bill. This council will be appointed  by  the  Minister,  in
consultation with the Cabinet, and will consist of a  chairperson,  a  vice-
chairperson and three additional members.

Employers and employees in the private security industry will not  have  any
direct  representation  on  the  council,  despite  the  fact  that   levies
collected from the industry will support the regulatory  authority.  It  was
argued that no person who has a vested interest in the industry should  have
control of the council. There is merit in this argument.

However, the DP is not asking for  the  industry  to  have  control  of  the
council, but merely for it to have representation on  the  council.  It  was
further argued that the industry could  be  represented  through  committees
established in terms of clause 13(1) and clause 13(2) of the Bill.  This  is
true, but there is no obligation to set up these committees.

In short, the DP objects to the fact that the stakeholders in  the  industry
are not guaranteed any representation on  the  council  or  its  committees,
even if such committees are established.
The other major difficulty with  the  Bill  relates  to  the  provisions  of
clause 26 dealing with suspension of  registration  as  a  security  service
provider. In terms of this section, if  there  is  a  prima  facie  case  of
improper conduct or commission of an offence ranging from  high  treason  to
crimen injuria, the registration of the security  service  provider  may  be
suspended.

For the sake of those of us  who  are  not  lawyers,  prima  facie  in  this
context means any allegation from anyone which on the  face  of  it  is  not
false; and crimen injuria means calling someone a nasty name with intent  to
hurt their feelings. The difficulty here is that people in the industry  can
be deprived of their livelihood if somebody  makes  a  malicious  allegation
which later, on proper investigation, turns out to be false,  and  there  is
no proportionality in that they can be deprived of their livelihood  for  an
insignificant offence.

There are other less  important  difficulties  in  that  the  definition  of
``locksmith'' is too broadly cast, and the poor unfortunate  individual  who
repairs shoes and cuts keys on the street corner will have  to  comply  with
the provisions of the Bill, unless these people are  expressly  excluded  by
the Minister. Accordingly, the DP opposes the Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs  E  N  LUBIDLA:  Chairperson,  governments  throughout  the  world  have
expressed alarm at the rapid increase  of  private  security  industries  in
their respective countries. In South Africa we have gone a step  further  by
exploring the implications of the burgeoning private security industry,  not
only on the state but on society in general.

Our exploration into  the  implications  of  the  growing  private  security
industry has led us to conclude that effective regulation of  this  industry
is in the best interests of the country.

While  we  must  acknowledge  the  important  role  the  industry  plays  in
contributing to meeting the demands of South Africans in  respect  of  their
safety and security and in terms of providing employment  opportunities,  we
must at the  same  time  recognise  the  dangers  of  leaving  the  industry
unregulated.

A significant portion of the industry  is  run  by  ex-military  and  police
officers. Some people would say: So what? Why should we  worry  about  that?
The reason why we should worry about this is because the  industry,  by  its
very nature, gives rise to certain sensitivities, owing to the  capacity  of
some businesses to be highly  armed  to  engage  in  investigations  and  to
intercept and monitor voice-activated equipment. This can easily  be  abused
by elements who gained experience in the military or police.

Secondly, in some instances there are  currently  members  of  our  security
services who may have an interest in private security businesses.  This  has
implications for our national security because of the potential conflict  of
interests between such members charged with protecting the interests of  the
state and the interests of the private security industry.

The regulation of the industry is not only important for the  protection  of
our national security,  but  is  also  vital  to  prevent  monopoly  of  the
industry by a few companies.

The past few years have seen a number of  takeovers  and  mergers  that  are
placing control of the industry in the hands of a  few  security  companies.
This has serious implications for Government policies which seek to  address
economic  inequalities  by  promoting  small  and  medium   businesses   and
increasing  economic  opportunities  for  historically  disadvantaged  South
Africans.

In addition, there are a number of other problems  in  the  industry,  which
will continue unless some sort of regulation is exercised over  the  private
security industry. Here,  I  am  specifically  referring  to  the  abuse  of
employees by employers, such as underpayment and long hours of  work;  abuse
of the public by security officers; registration  as  security  officers  or
companies as a means to access arms and  Government  contracts;  involvement
in criminal activities; and unscrupulous behaviour such as  smear  campaigns
to undermine competitors for lucrative contracts.

The objectives and principles of the Private  Security  Industry  Regulation
Bill  are  to  ensure  that  the  industry  operates  in   a   professional,
transparent and accountable manner. It also  places  an  obligation  on  the
industry  to  uphold  the   principles   of   democracy   and   to   promote
transformation. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Die onaanvaarbaar hoë vlakke van misdaad, en veral dié wat  die  persoonlike
veiligheid en sekuriteit van mense bedreig, het 'n ongekend e groei  in  die
private    beveiligingsbedryf    tot    gevolg    gehad.    Dit    is     'n
multimiljardrandbedryf waarin buitelandse aandeelhouers  blykbaar  sowat  R3
miljard belê het.

Die wetsontwerp het buitelandse aandeelhouding aanvanklik  verbied.  Ons  is
bly daar is uiteindelik besluit om daarvan afstand te doen.  Dit  is  egter,
soos reeds aangedui, steeds 'n vereiste  ingevolge  klousule  23(1)  dat  'n
beveiligingsonderneming slegs deur  'n  Suid-Afrikaner  of  'n  persoon  wat
permanente verblyfreg in Suid-Afrika het, bestuur kan word.  Slegs  sodanige
persone kan  direkteure  van  'n  beveiligingsmaatskappy  wees.  Hoewel  die
meeste buitelandse aandeelhouers blykbaar nie daarvan  gehou  het  nie,  was
hulle bereid om dit te aanvaar.

Die  Nasionale  Vergadering   het   verskeie   goeie   wysigings   aan   die
oorspronklike wetsontwerp aanvaar. Die definisie van 'n private  ondersoeker
is byvoorbeeld vereng sodat ouditeure, advokate,  prokureurs  en  forensiese
wetenskaplikes nie daardeur geraak word  nie.  Poligrafiste  is  byvoorbeeld
uitgehaal en  daar  is  ook  'n  wysiging  aangebring  dat  die  regulerende
owerheid  aan  die  parlement  moet  verslag  doen.  Die  invoeging  van  'n
gedragskode vir inspekteurs was 'n goeie wysiging.

Soos in die debat in die Nasionale Vergadering aangedui, bestaan daar  egter
steeds sekere probleme oor  dié  wetgewing.  Ons  meen  byvoorbeeld  dit  is
verkeerd om sleutelmakers as verskaffers van beveiligingsdienste  te  beskou
en in die proses aan die  verreikende  regulering  van  die  wetsontwerp  te
onderwerp. Onses insiens sal dit 'n baie negatiewe invloed op klein sake  in
die bedryf hê.

Ons wil ook hê werknemers  en  werkgewers  in  die  beveiligingsbedryf  moet
verteenwoordiging op die raad  van  die  beveiligingsbedryf  se  regulerende
owerheid kry. Dit is  moeilik  verstaanbaar  dat  dié  mense  wat  die  geld
verskaf sodat die owerheid kan funksioneer, nie in die  raad  verteenwoordig
is nie.

'n Derde probleem wat uitgewys is, is dat die minister té veel  mag  het  om
riglyne vir die raad neer te lê en om selfs verantwoordelikheid  vir  sekere
funksies van die raad te aanvaar  indien  daar  in  die  uitvoering  van  'n
funksie nie aan die sogenaamde aanvaarde standaard voldoen word nie.

Dit  is  ongetwyfeld  baie  belangrik  om  die  private   beveiligingsbedryf
behoorlik te reguleer. Die oorgrote meerderheid  Suid-Afrikaners  kan  egter
nie die dienste van die private beveiligingsbedryf bekostig  nie  en  daarom
kan dié bedryf nooit die  rol  vervul  van  'n  polisiediens  wat  behoorlik
toegerus is wat personeel en toerusting betref nie.

Ek wil die hoop uitspreek dat ons in Suid-Afrika daarin  sal  kan  slaag  om
misdaadvlakke in die volgende paar jaar só te laat daal  dat  die  vraag  na
private beveiligingsdienste eerder sal afneem as toeneem.

Soos in die ander Huis kan ons ongelukkig, as gevolg van die  redes  genoem,
nie die wetsontwerp in sy huidige vorm volledig ondersteun  nie.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, the protection  of  every  person's  right  to
life and personal safety and security and everyone's right not to  have  his
or her property unlawfully taken away  from  them,  is  fundamental  to  the
welfare and social and economic development of every individual.

The unacceptably high levels of crime, especially those  that  threaten  the
personal safety and security of people, have led to unprecedented growth  in
the private security industry. This  is  a  multibillion  rand  industry  in
which  foreign  shareholders  have  apparently  invested  approximately   R3
billion.

The Bill initially prohibited foreign shareholding. We are pleased  that  it
was decided  to  do  away  with  this  in  the  end.   However,  as  already
indicated, according to clause 23(1)  it  is  still  a  requirement  that  a
security enterprise may only be managed by  a  South  African  or  a  person
having permanent residential status in South Africa. Only such  persons  may
be directors of a security company. Even though  most  foreign  shareholders
apparently disliked this, they were prepared to accept it.

The National Assembly accepted  various  good  amendments  to  the  original
Bill. The definition of  a  private  investigator,  for  example,  has  been
narrowed so that auditors, advocates, lawyers and forensic  scientists  will
not be affected by it. Polygraphists, for example,  have  been  removed  and
there has  also  been  an  amendment  to  the  effect  that  the  regulatory
authority must report to Parliament. The addition of a code of  conduct  for
inspectors was a good amendment.

As indicated in the  debate  in  the  National  Assembly,  however,  certain
problems still exist with regard to this legislation. For  example,  we  are
of the opinion that it  is  wrong  to  regard  locksmiths  as  providers  of
security services and in the process to subject  them  to  the  far-reaching
regulation of the Bill. In our  opinion  this  will  have  a  very  negative
influence on small enterprises in the industry.

We would also like employers and employees in the security industry to  have
representation  on  the  council  of  the  security  industry's   regulatory
authority. It is difficult to understand why those people  who  provide  the
money for the authority to function are not represented on the council.

A third problem which has been pointed out is  that  the  Minister  has  too
much power in laying down guidelines for  the  council  and  even  accepting
responsibility for certain functions of the council in the  event  that  so-
called acceptable standards are  not  adhered  to  in  the  execution  of  a
function.

It is definitely very important to properly regulate  the  private  security
industry. The greater majority of South  Africans,  however,  cannot  afford
the services of the private security industry and  therefore  this  industry
can never fulfil the role of a police  service  that  is  properly  equipped
with regard to personnel and equipment.

I would like to express the hope that we in South  Africa  will  succeed  in
reversing the crime levels during the next few years to such an extent  that
the  demand  for  private  security  services  will  decrease  rather   than
increase.
As in the other House, we unfortunately cannot, as a result  of  the  above-
mentioned reasons, fully support the Bill in its current form. [Applause.]]

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister and members of the House,  it
gives me great pleasure as a member of the Select Committee on Security  and
Constitutional Affairs to be accorded  this  tremendous  opportunity  to  be
able to address members on  this  important  piece  of  legislation.  It  is
important precisely because  it  gives  us  once  more  the  opportunity  to
execute the mandate of the majority of our people on whose behalf I  proudly
speak in this Chamber this afternoon; to lead them and to create  conditions
of security in the areas where they live, work, play, worship  and  probably
enjoy themselves.

The protection, therefore, of every person's  rights  to  life  and  to  the
security of the person as well as the right not to be deprived  of  property
is fundamental to the wellbeing and to the social and  economic  development
of every person. It is in this  context  that  the  strategic  role  of  the
security industry in protecting these rights is realised.

It has become clear that regulatory reform of the private security  industry
in this country is an absolute necessity. The  fact  is  that  the  existing
Act, as was  pointed  out  earlier  by  the  hon  the  Deputy  Minister,  is
obsolete.

In case - if I may, through you, Madam Chair, offer a free English lesson  -
it is not clear to the hon Theron of the  DP  what  ``obsolete''  means,  it
means that this legislation that we are trying to deal with  this  afternoon
is basically  outdated.  I  could  probably  go  on  to  to  assist  him  by
explaining  exactly  why  we  feel  that  there  is  a  necessity  for   the
legislation to be amended in the manner in which we are amending it.

The fact is that the very nature of this industry has changed. The  question
could then be asked: Where do we begin?  Clearly,  we  must  deal  with  the
concerns of our people about the elements  in  the  industry  who  have  the
potential, as has been pointed out earlier on, to  engage  in  abuse,  given
the very nature of the activities of some members within the industry.

The industry is no longer confined - this point too  was  made  earlier  on,
and I think it is important that we emphasise  it  -  to  the  guarding  and
protection of persons and premises. It is very important that we repeat  the
point over and over again, for the sake of those who  want  to  oppose  this
legislation, so that they begin  to  understand  exactly  what  informs  the
views that we are articulating in this House this afternoon.

This shows that there is a strong case for the regulation being proposed  in
this legislation. We do not need private armies in this  country  that  want
to masquerade as legitimate private  security  entities  so  that  they  can
continue with what the Deputy Minister  has  referred  to  as  the  kind  of
nefarious activities that they have been carrying out in this  country,  and
are still engaging in. I think  it  was  necessary  for  this  point  to  be
emphasised.
The Deputy Minister has dealt with the prerequisites,  as  provided  for  in
the legislation, for registration, membership  and  whatnot,  so  I  am  not
going to deal with them, but I felt that it would be important to deal  with
an issue of national interest.

Regulation is necessary,  in  the  first  place,  to  protect  the  national
interest in respect of the  potential  threats  to  state  security  because
certain  elements  abuse  their  powers  and  functions.  Secondly,  it   is
necessary to deal with the potential impact  of  the  conflict  between  the
activity ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  I  am  sure
Kgoshi Mokoena was right to say that the impact of  yesterday  is  beginning
to show. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY:  Chairperson,  I  will  be  very
brief.

The first point I wish to make is  that  when  the  Bill  emerged  from  the
Cabinet it did not have any provision to prevent an investment. The  DP  and
others never tire of  telling  the  executive  not  to  interfere  with  the
portfolio committees, whereas they are the ones who came with  the  idea  of
preventing an investment. We are the ones who had to overrule the  portfolio
committee. Now, how does one deal with a situation where  someone  announces
that they are going to oppose  the  Bill  because  the  executive  made  the
mistake of  providing  for  foreign  investment?  And  that  is  a  terrible
blunder, because we did not.

The Bill, as published originally, has nothing like  that.  Some  people  in
the portfolio committee thought: ``Let us teach the  executive  a  lesson,''
and usually they are supported by the opposition.  They  are  the  ones  who
always say that the executive must not interfere and allow Parliament -  the
portfolio committees are now referred to  as  Parliament  -  to  change  the
laws. That is what has happened. So please, let us not  hear  this  sort  of
thing anymore, that somebody  came  with  a  Bill  which  provided  for  the
exclusion of investment. That statement did not  come  from  the  executive,
for which it had to  take  the  flak  from  foreign  countries  in  view  of
agreements that we have signed on the matter of investment.

But what I would like to say is that we are only talking  about  investment,
not control. We still insist that the boards and  the  control  of  security
companies must be in the hands of South Africa. That is common  practice  in
most countries. They do allow one or two members, for  instance  in  France,
Brazil,  etc,  on  the  board.  But,  generally,  all   countries   restrict
membership of the boards of private security companies  to  their  citizens,
and there is nothing strange about that.

The biggest companies in this country are  regulated  by  the  registrar  of
companies and  they  are  not  represented  in  the  regulatory  body  which
regulates public and private companies. Why is it  so  strange  to  have  an
independent regulatory body regulate what is now  a  big,  private  security
industry  and  why  should  the  industry  regulate  itself?  It  is  not  a
professional body. These are not doctors or something, but businesses.

One has people sitting on the regulatory body,  representing  big  financial
interests, and who, therefore,  can  manipulate  the  regulatory  authority.
Whilst it is regarded as a necessity, I do not think that it is  proper  for
people to have big companies  as  part  of  the  regulatory  authority.  Who
regulates Anglo American Corporation or any of the big companies?  Are  they
represented in the regulatory machinery of this country? They  are  not?  So
let us be really reasonable about this.

South Africa has become a blackmailers' paradise,  with  allegations  flying
this way and that way, in the media,  in  Parliament,  everywhere,  with  no
judicial process. It has become a habit, which certainly was  not  the  case
some years ago. Now it is easy for one to make  any  allegations  about  the
President or somebody  else.  As  a  result,  we  receive  complaints  about
possible allegations against private security companies,  whereas  everybody
is busy making allegations, with no judicial process, inside and outside  of
politics.

The locksmiths have for years been lobbying to be included in  this  private
security industry, and they have got reasons for doing so.  I  do  not  know
why people now turn around and say they must ask  the  locksmiths  why  they
have been agitating to  be  included  and  not  excluded  from  the  private
security industry regulations. I know what they are trying to do.

We are talking about locksmiths, but what about the shops where one  can  go
and produce a key and ask for its duplicate?  I  think  the  locksmiths  are
trying to pull one by demanding that we close those  very  convenient  shops
in which we buy keys. The chaps that run the shops that sell keys, etc,  are
not locksmiths and are not members of the organisation  of  locksmiths.  One
must ask them why they have always demanded to be included in the industry.

As soon as people bear arms, they are  not  the  same  as  people  who  sell
chocolate. The private security companies are very necessary, but they  have
to have modern firearms and they have to carry all these heavy  weapons.  Is
one saying that one does not require to regulate such people? Does one  want
such people to be private armies, going around without regulations? How  can
we accept that type of thing? One has 200 000 chaps armed to the teeth in  a
country that has no regulations. What is that?

So we want to regulate the type of arms they carry and all kinds of  things,
because they are  armed,  and  people  who  are  armed  are  different  from
everybody else. This is not just a business, it is run  by  people  who  are
armed and represent  a  security  problem  because  they  are  organised  as
armies. How can one just allow them to roam about the place  without  strict
controls?

So I think, really, that we must think about it and realise that  there  was
a need to produce a piece of legislation such as this one. I  do  not  think
that in terms of this Bill the Minister of Safety  and  Security  will  have
powers that he does not have already. What powers are we talking about  that
he does not have in relation to  security?  The  Minister  must  have  those
powers in order to be able to exercise proper control over armed  groups  of
people.

If one wants to protect one's house or garage without weapons and without  a
group of armed men around one, there will be no restrictions. There will  be
no regulation. We do not regulate people with a  whole  lot  of  weapons  in
their houses. They have licences for rifles and hunting rifles.  We  do  not
regulate that. We only regulate the possession of the firearm,  but  if  one
has people who are now organised people as  a  group  and  are  armed,  then
whatever their purpose is one must have proper regulation.

Let us not have double standards - that it is all  right  for  Australia  or
France to regulate the private security industry, but South Africa must  not
regulate the security industry. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance  with  section  75  of  the  Constitution  (New
National Party dissenting).

                         UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  I  take  this
opportunity to welcome the Minister of Sport and Recreation, and ask him  to
address this House of behalf of the Minister of Labour.

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Chairperson, today  on  behalf  of  my
colleague, I present to this Council the new  Unemployment  Insurance  Bill.
The finalisation of the process of introducing this Bill to the  NCOP  marks
a new chapter in the history of  the  Unemployment  Insurance  Fund,  as  it
attempts to address the systematic inefficiencies of the past.

A very brief historical review of the fund shows that within five  years  of
this decision the fund started to  experience  financial  difficulties.  The
state responded to calls for assistance during  1984,  1989  and  1994.  The
Bill before the Council goes to the heart of  the  current  problems  facing
the fund. It is aimed at ensuring that we achieve a  lasting  resolution  to
the financial woes that, for a very long time, have plagued the fund.

During the period of attempting to resolve the funding crisis, the fund  has
continued tirelessly to  provide  a  safety  net  for  the  most  vulnerable
workers in our country. Through various  administrative  interventions,  the
fund has never had occasion to turn  away  any  legitimate  claimant.  Today
also represents the fulfilment of the commitment  the  Minister  of  Labour,
Membathisi Mdladlana, made in June  1999,  when  he  unveiled  his  15-point
programme of action to restructure the fund.

Unemployment insurance  is  an  important  policy  area  as  it  contributes
towards the improvement of  the  social  safety  net  to  mitigate  economic
hardships  for  the  unemployed.  The  Bill  pays  particular  attention  to
extending unemployment insurance coverage beyond the  current  levels.  This
is aimed at enhancing the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of the  fund
and at creating an environment conducive to improved compliance.

Amongst the reforms being proposed is the  increase  of  coverage  to  bring
every working person within the UIF net. This is to ensure that  the  fund's
income is increased, whilst low-income earners  are  compensated  at  income
levels that are acceptable and are able to deal with the  issue  of  poverty
relief. It is estimated that these measures will bring in additional  income
of R215 million a year, together  with  the  benefits  of  better  and  easy
management of wage audits and earnings declarations.

It is also anticipated that with  the  transfer  of  revenue  collection  to
Sars,  which  is  to  be  enabled   through   the   Unemployment   Insurance
Contributions Bill, the fund will stand to benefit from  its  current  tough
compliance regime.

Where is the background to this? The  need  for  the  restructuring  of  the
Unemployment Insurance Fund arises from the obligations placed on the  state
by the Constitution,  the  policy  environment  of  the  Reconstruction  and
Development Programme and labour market policy considerations.

The Department of Labour's approach has been informed by the report  of  the
Presidential Commission to Investigate Labour Market  Policy  in  1996,  the
International  Labour   Organisation's   country   studies   and   extensive
consultation with the relevant stakeholders.

The restructuring of the Unemployment Insurance Fund seeks  to  address  the
following shortcomings within the current legislation: one, the limited  and
nonviable  nature  of  coverage;  two,  weak  enforcement   and   compliance
measures; three, the lack of financial sustainability and the  depletion  of
the fund's financial reserves; four,  the  rigid  benefit  structure;  five,
discrimination against certain categories  of  employees;  and  lastly,  the
lack of a comprehensive database of contributors.

In 1996 a three-person task team, comprising experts from  labour,  business
and academia, was  appointed.  Their  task  was  to  perform  a  situational
analysis  of  the  administration  of  unemployment  insurance,  conduct   a
comparative analysis based on international norms, and make  recommendations
regarding the findings and the financing thereof.

The task team recommended that: one, coverage be  extended  to  all  workers
with  minimum  exclusions;  two,  gender  discrimination   be   removed   by
separating maternity and unemployment  benefits;  three,  a  progressive  or
graduated benefit schedule be  implemented;  four,  the  existing  types  of
benefits be retained; five, stricter enforcement and compliance measures  be
introduced;  six,  a  computerised  database  be  introduced;   seven,   all
stakeholders be included in the processes and structures  of  the  UIF;  and
lastly, limited executive powers be given to the UIF board.
In November 1998, after several reports were tabled on the financial  status
of the fund, Cabinet approved the  release  of  the  task  team  report  for
public comment. In December 1998 a report was released on the  restructuring
of the UIF. The document was published in the Gazette  and  the  public  was
invited to make relevant submissions to the  unemployment  insurance  board,
which was given the responsibility of drafting new legislation.

On 2 February 2000  Cabinet  approved  two  new  Bills  -  the  Unemployment
Insurance Bill  and  the  Unemployment  Insurance  Contributions  Bill.  The
latter  Bill  deals  with   the   collection   of   unemployment   insurance
contributions from employers, and is  intended  to  consolidate  collections
under a single  administration.  As  we  have  said,  Sars  will  take  that
responsibility.

The  Unemployment  Insurance  Bill  will  be  administered  solely  by   the
Department of Labour, and the Unemployment  Insurance  Fund  will  have  the
singular responsibility for  the  administration  and  the  adjudication  of
claims. This practice and approach is in line with those adopted by  similar
institutions the world over.

With regard to problems being addressed, the draft legislation will  address
a number of difficulties currently that are facing the UIF as  a  result  of
weaknesses within the  current  legislation.  The  fund's  obligations  have
expanded in an unsustainable manner. This is due to the fact  that  coverage
has been extended to a growing number of low-income contributors whose  risk
of unemployment is high, whilst the relative number  of  those  with  a  low
risk of unemployment has dwindled. Higher-income  earners  with  the  lowest
probability of unemployment are excluded.

Currently, litigation procedures impose scant fines on  employers  who  fail
to make their unemployment insurance contributions. In addition,  the  costs
entailed in taking a defaulting employer  to  court  are  unduly  high.  The
current system  of  contribution  collection  and  payroll  declarations  by
employers is very inadequate and requires a complete overhaul.  The  use  of
contributors' record  cards  as  the  only  means  of  determining  benefits
payable to contributors has exposed the fund  to  potential  abuse  by  both
employers and employees, especially employers.

The  Act  discriminates  against  women  and  certain  other  categories  of
contributors and potential beneficiaries. What are the key changes that  are
being introduced? We  have  spoken  about  the  wide  coverage.  Within  the
framework of the new legislation, coverage  of  workers  within  the  labour
market will be extended.

For the first time  in  the  history  of  unemployment  protection  in  this
country, it will  include  domestic  and  seasonal  workers,  and  employees
earning above the current UIF annual  income  threshold  of  R97  188.  This
inclusion of higher-income groups as UIF contributors will be determined  by
a maximum income threshold to be determined from time to time by the law.

Regarding the graduated benefit schedule, when the UIF was first  introduced
in South Africa in 1946 - some of the hon members were not yet born  then  -
the legislators intended that the income replacement ratios  of  the  lowest
paid workers should be much higher than  those  of  the  better  paid.  This
graduated benefit schedule lasted only until 1977 when it was replaced  with
the current scheme of 45% income replacement. It is now proposed  that  this
graduated benefit schedule be reintroduced and that  benefits  be  based  on
income replacement ranging from 60% for low-income earners to  38%  for  the
middle and high-income earners.

Maternity benefits were first introduced by the UIF  in  1954,  again  older
than  even  the  Minister  -  of  Labour,  not  of  Sport  and   Recreation.
[Laughter.] A female contributor must be paid benefits for  maternity  leave
whether or not she is capable of and available for work.  The  UIF  provides
45% of the last wage for a maximum period of six  months.  However,  drawing
maternity benefits  means  that  women  workers,  therefore,  use  up  their
unemployment benefits. Given that it is obviously only women who  apply  for
maternity benefits, this provision  discriminates  against  women.  The  new
legislation,  therefore,  proposes  to  eliminate  this  discrimination   by
separating maternity and unemployment benefits so that employees who  go  on
maternity leave can do so without having to  draw  down  their  unemployment
benefits.

The new UIF Bill seeks to address the legacy  of  high  levels  of  employer
defaulting and  noncompliance  by  proposing  the  introduction  of  tougher
penalties and fines on those employers who fail to comply. This  measure  is
further strengthened by proposals to bring the UIF collection  regime  under
the ambit of Sars.  It  makes  life  easier  because  it  will  not  be  the
department but Sars which does the collection. Those employers  who  default
will have to deal with Sars.

The Bill will bestow on the department wide-ranging powers aimed at  dealing
with aspects of noncompliance such as underdisclosure of employee  earnings,
working and drawing nonpayment,  and  deliberate  misrepresentations.  These
measures are deemed sufficient to bring an end to the  scourge  of  employer
and employee fraud. It will  also  enhance  our  capacity  to  identify  and
prosecute defaulters. These measures will also bring further enhancement  to
the controlled environment within which the fund has to operate.

It is further proposed that an electronic contributor database  be  created,
which will contain individual contribution  records  for  each  contributor.
This will eliminate paper-based operations including the current  blue  card
system. It will also eliminate the potential for fraudulent  claims  because
each claimant can be prequalified for benefits even before  she  reports  to
the office of the Unemployment Insurance Fund. Above all, this measure  will
increase compliance by requiring employers to submit declarations  of  those
in their employ, their income and any other details that may  be  prescribed
by the law.

The Government's approach to the Unemployment Insurance Fund is  that  while
its primary role is to provide a social safety net for  the  unemployed,  it
should be  able  to  finance  its  statutory  obligations  from  the  income
generated from contributions and other sources  available  to  it.  Only  in
exceptional  circumstances  of  high  unemployment  arising  from   economic
restructuring can the state be expected to  assist  during  that  particular
transition. In the event where state funding has to be requested,  the  Bill
sets out clear and onerous procedures  and  requirements  for  such  funding
from the fiscus.

In  order  to  ensure  sound  financial  management  and  to   address   the
uncertainties regarding the financial viability of the fund,  the  UIF  Bill
sets out clear roles and guidelines on financial  management  in  line  with
the PFMA. The Bill also proposes the  requirement  for  the  performance  of
annual actuarial assessments  to  determine  the  soundness  of  the  fund's
finances and reserves to finance statutory commitments  and  to  advise  the
Minister of Labour on  the  availability  of  funding  alternatives  without
having to resort to the fiscus.

Regarding entitlement and benefits, the Bill proposes the retention  of  all
five  statutory  benefits,  in  other  words  for  unemployment,  maternity,
illness, adoption and dependence  of  disease.  However,  benefits  will  be
accumulated and limited up to 34 weeks in any given four-year  period.  This
measure will eliminate the loophole that exists in the current Act.

As members would have realised from the aforementioned, Government  is  very
serious about addressing problems facing the unemployed  by  providing  some
form of safety net. I note and concur with the select  committee  amendments
agreed to in respect of the definitions of employee and the remuneration  in
order to align these with the  Unemployment  Insurance  Contributions  Bill,
which was introduced today in the National Assembly. The  Bill  before  this
House is  the  culmination  of  the  joint  efforts  of  the  staff  of  the
Department of Labour, the National Treasury, the Select Committee on  Labour
and Public Enterprises and social partners. We wish to extend  to  them  our
gratitude on the dawn of the new Unemployment Insurance Fund. [Applause.]

Mr S L E FENYANE: Chairperson, I know that members have had a long  day  and
I am not going to extend the  torture  that  has  been  endured  by  members
throughout the day. I must also indicate that  the  Minister  of  Labour  in
loco duly surprised me by mentioning almost everything that I was  going  to
say. Moreover, since he is not the real Minister  but  just  a  Minister  in
loco, he indeed surprised me. I salute him for that. I shall  have  to  skip
many clauses that I wanted to make reference to. I shall  try  not  to  bore
members.

The Bill in front of us  deals  essentially  with  an  unemployment  benefit
fund. Its main purpose  is  to  establish  an  unemployment  fund  to  which
employers and employees should contribute to ascertain  its  sustainability.
At the moment, the Fund is typically  bankrupt.  It  depends  solely  on  an
overdraft facility for its financial upkeep. This Bill is a  product  of  an
elaborate consultative process that included labour,  business,  members  of
the academia, Nedlac and other eminent authority  figures  in  our  society.
The Portfolio Committee on Labour further subjected it to a rigorous  public
hearings process. All those who participated in  it  agreed  that  it  is  a
difficult piece of legislation to deal with.

I would like to urge members to support this Bill. I  know  that  there  are
other  outstanding  issues  in  this  Bill  which  have  not  been  properly
addressed. However, I would like to caution that we do not have  the  luxury
of time to dither and procrastinate, as the fund is in a deficit,  and  many
unemployed persons are queueing for benefits that may not accrue to them  if
we do not pass this Bill. We are definitely going to have to  revisit  these
outstanding issues.

However, let us pass the Bill now, since we  are  not  able  to  stop  time.
Neither do we  have  a  crystal  ball  which  can  help  us  predict  future
eventualities. Let us pass it now. I know members are  tired.  Let  us  just
pass the Bill. We will revisit it later to look at  other  things.  I  would
urge everyone to support this Bill. [Applause.]

Ms C S BOTHA: Mr Chairperson, at the outset, I would like to  say  that  the
DP would very much like to support more of the Bills the  ANC  passes.  Will
they please  write  them  in  such  a  way  that  we  are  able  to  do  so?
[Interjections.]

Almal is seker  bekend  met  die  sogenaamde  bloukaartstelsel.  Dit  is  'n
staatsintervensie om mense wat hul werk  verloor,  met  'n  gedeeltelike  en
tydelike betaling te ondersteun, terwyl hulle ander werk soek.  Dit  is  die
essensie  van  die  werkloosheidsversekeringswetsontwerp.  Daar   was   geen
prinsipiële verskille tussen  komiteelede  oor  wat  met  hierdie  wetgewing
bereik behoort te word nie. Die  voorstelle  wat  tot  verbetering  van  die
huidige funksionering van die fonds sal lei soos invordering deur  Sars,  'n
verbeterde databasis, beskermende maatreëls om  gebruikers  se  toegang  tot
voordele te vergemaklik en die staat se toetrede om huidige tekorte  aan  te
vul, word allerweë verwelkom. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I am sure that everyone is acquainted with the so-called blue card  system.
This is a state intervention aimed at supporting people who have lost  their
jobs with a partial and temporary payment, while they are looking for  other
jobs. That is the essence of the Unemployment Insurance Bill. There were  no
objections in principle amongst committee  members  as  to  what  should  be
achieved  by  this  legislation.  The  proposals  which  will  lead  to  the
improvement of the present functioning of the fund, such  as  collection  by
Sars, an improved  data  base,  protective  measures  to  facilitate  users'
access to benefits and intervention  by  the  state  to  supplement  present
deficits, are widely welcomed.]

However, there are some real practical problems with the execution  of  this
Bill. For example, I cannot see the provision  for  only  excluding  workers
who work less than 24 hours per month from UIF benefits even being  observed
in practice. This kind of provision will cause employers to  avoid,  if  not
evade  the  law.  Instead  of  achieving  its  objective  to  increase   the
sensitivity of our legal framework to the imperative to create jobs,  it  is
likely to hamper it.

We need to appreciate the administrative burden  imposed  on  employers  who
are likely to give temporary relief to the unemployed, if they  are  obliged
to observe this kind of record-keeping.  I  am  just  looking  at  practical
considerations as well as my own experience. It is simply not  realistic  to
expect this. At the same time, seasonal workers are  recognised  only  after
three months of employment. In itself, it is problematic to implement,  but,
at least, more manageable than the aforesaid.

However, the issue about which we feel most strongly  is  the  exclusion  of
the state from the ambit of the Bill. Not only does this create  a  separate
class of employer, for which the definition  of  employer  was  specifically
amended to allow this, but no cogent argument could be  brought  to  justify
this position. In fact, the department itself admitted  that  the  exclusion
could be successfully challenged in court.

This  exclusion  also  limits  the  principle  of  cross-subsidisation   and
resultant stabilisation of the fund for which it seems  patently  unfair  to
single out the private sector employer. It can also be challenged by  public
sector employees who are not covered by the provisions of the  Bill.  I  may
say that this was also asked to be addressed in the report by the  committee
in the National Assembly.

In the first draft of the Bill, domestic workers were  also  excluded.  This
committee or the whole of the committee objected unanimously.  The  12-month
window period, which is  now  being  given  to  the  department  to  produce
measures to include domestic and seasonal workers in  the  benefits  of  the
Bill, should not have arisen. There is no justification  why  this  was  not
accomplished in the period during which this  Bill  was  in  the  incubator.
Want ons is al sedert 1996 besig met hierdie wetsontwerp. [Because  we  have
been working on this Bill since 1996.]

We fully expect the department to remedy the situation within  the  12-month
limit that they have been given.

The Bill has been successful in dealing with maternity benefits  and  rights
from unemployment insurance, and progress is revealed in that  it  does  not
prevent women who have access to  maternity  benefits  from  also  accessing
unemployment benefits. However, it appears that the Bill  seeks  to  protect
both   the   state   and   employers   from   bearing   adequate   financial
responsibility. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr P J C  NEL:  Mevrou  die  Voorsitter,  een  van  die  grootste  wesenlike
probleme waarvoor die Regering van die dag te staan  kom,  is  verseker  die
geweldig  hoë  werkloosheidsyfer,  en  daarom  is  dit  so  noodsaaklik  dat
voorsiening gemaak word vir die oorlewing van diegene  wat  daardeur  geraak
word.

Die huidige finansiële status van die  Werkloosheidversekeringsfonds  is  'n
goeie aanduiding  van  watter  afmetings  werkloosheid  reeds  in  ons  land
aangeneem het. Hierdie is 'n  probleem  wat  bó  partypolitiek  verhef  moet
word, en dit is verseker 'n uitdaging vir alle partye om hande te vat en  na
oplossings te soek.

Die ou wet het baie leemtes gehad en die stuk wetgewing wat ons vandag  hier
hanteer, het dit ten doel om die swakhede aan te pak. Die Nuwe NP steun  dan
ook die wenslikheid van die wysigingswetsontwerp en die  wysigings  wat  dit
ten doel het om verbeterings in die ou wet aan te bring. Daar bestaan  egter
kommer oor vele leemtes in die wysigingswetsontwerp.

Die  huidige   finansiële   status   van   die   fonds   en   die   ernstige
kontantvloeiprobleme wat dit  tans  beleef,  wek  ernstige  kommer  oor  die
lewensvatbaarheid van die fonds in die toekoms.  Klousule  3  (1)(c)  bepaal
dat werknemers in die nasionale en provinsiale staatsdiens  uitgesluit  word
van deelname aan die fonds. Dit beteken dat die grootste  werkgewer  in  die
land uitgesluit word as bydraer tot die fonds.

Dit is na ons mening diskriminerend en inkonsekwent, en teenstrydig met  een
van  die  hervormingsmaatreëls  in  die  wetsontwerp,  naamlik  om  nie   te
diskrimineer teen  sekere  kategorieë  werkers  nie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Dit
klink vir my voorts asof dit ook  teenstrydig  met  die  bepalings  van  die
Grondwet kan wees.

Hierdie aangeleentheid verg  verseker  verdere  ondersoek  met  die  oog  op
hersiening.  Daar  is  ook  nog  nie  behoorlik  ondersoek  gedoen  oor  die
finansiële  impak  wat  die  voorgestelde  kraamvoordele  op  die  fonds  se
finansies gaan hê nie. Dít moet nog verder ondersoek word. Die voordele  vir
huiswerkers is nog nie deeglik deurtrap nie. Dít moet nog  verder  ondersoek
word.  Wat  baie  belangrik  is,   is   dat   die   Unemployment   Insurance
Contributions Bill is nog nie goedgekeur nie.

Hierdie stuk wetgewing het nog ver te veel los ente wat in die lug  hang  en
ek voorsien dat dit binnekort weer gewysig sal moet word. Ek  dink  die  agb
voorsitter van die gekose komitee stem met my saam. Die  Nuwe  NP  kan  nie,
met die beste wil in die wêreld, 'n wetsontwerp soos hierdie in  sy  huidige
vorm  steun  nie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation   of   Afrikaans   speech
follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Madam Chairperson, one of the biggest  real  problems  facing
the  Government  of  the  day  is  most  certainly   the   alarmingly   high
unemployment figures, and that is why it is so essential that  provision  is
made for the survival of those who are affected by this.

The present financial status of the Unemployment Insurance Fund  is  a  good
indication of what proportions  unemployment  has  already  reached  in  our
country. This is a problem that should be beyond party politics, and  it  is
certainly a challenge to all parties to take hands and seek resolutions.

The old Act had  many  shortcomings  and  the  objective  of  the  piece  of
legislation  that  we  are  dealing  with  here  today  is  to  tackle   the
weaknesses. The New NP supports the desirability of the  amending  Bill  and
the amendments that seek to make the improvements to the old Act.  There  is
concern, however, about many shortcomings in the amending Bill.

The current financial status of the fund and the serious cash flow  problems
that it is at present experiencing give serious cause for concern about  the
viability of the fund in the future. Clause 3(1)(c) provides that  employers
in the national and  provincial  public  service  should  be  excluded  from
participation in the fund. This means  that  the  largest  employer  in  the
country is excluded from being a contributor to the fund.

In our view this is discriminatory and inconsistent,  and  contradictory  to
one of the reform measures in the Bill, namely not to  discriminate  against
certain categories of workers. [Interjections.] Furthermore,  it  sounds  to
me  as  if  it  could  also  be  contradictory  to  the  provisions  of  the
Constitution.

This matter requires further investigation with a view to  review.  Nor  has
there been adequate investigation into the financial impact of the  proposed
maternity benefits on the finances of the fund. This should be  investigated
further. The benefits for domestic employees has  not  yet  been  thoroughly
considered. This should be investigated further. What is very  important  is
that  the  Unemployment  Insurance  Contributions  Bill  has  not  yet  been
approved.

This piece of legislation still has far too many loose ends up  in  the  air
and I foresee that it will have to be amended again in the  near  future.  I
think the hon chairperson of the select committee agrees with  me.  The  New
NP cannot, with the best will in the world, support a Bill such as this  one
as it stands at present. [Interjections.]]

Mnu   M   J   BHENGU:   Mphathi   wohlelo,    ngisukuma    nokusho    ukuthi
umThethosivivinywa lona kwale kancane ungaphumeleli, njengoba esho  uMphathi
woHlelo  umfowethu  uFenyane  nelungu  elihloniphekile   lakwaBotha.   Kwale

Ngisho ukuthi-ke ngiyavumelana nomfowethu uFenyana nxa ethi  kukhona  izinto

Ngiyabonga  ukuthi  umfowethu  uFenyana  uthe  kuzolungiswa.   Kodwa   nakhu

Ngicabanga ukuthi uma sifunde leyo nto kuyoba kuhle kabi  ngoba  akufunakali
ukuthi sibe izigxivizo zokushaya izitembu. [Ihlombe.] (Translation  of  Zulu
speech follows.)

[Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, I  stand  up  to  say  that  this  Bill  nearly
failed, as the chairman, Mr Fenyane, and hon  Botha  have  said.  It  nearly
failed, but through the expertise of Mr Fenyane it was  a  success,  because
he knows how to make things a success.

I mean I agree with Mr Fenyane when he says that there are a  few  important
things that need to be checked. What I think needs to be checked is  whether
this Bill is in line with the PFMA. That is the only thing I would like  the
chairman of our committee to look at because it is  crucial.  Therefore,  we
agree, because we know what it is like when someone has been retrenched  and
has no food. It is better if there is something like this, because he  could
get something so that his children can have food.

I would to thank Mr Fenyane, because that matter will be corrected. I  would
like to conclude by saying  that  what  the  President  said  yesterday  was
crucial. He said: "When this country talks, the whole world listens."  I  am
saying this because it is dangerous to make laws while we  are  standing  on
our feet, or even running. When one makes laws, one needs to sit  down.  One
must not be rushed, like telling him that he is running out of time.  If  we
do that it will mean that we are just rubber stamps, and that is  dangerous.
I think if we can learn that, it will be good, because we  should  not  just
be rubber stamps. [Applause.]]

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, I actually do  not
want to waste members' time by responding to the DP, which does not want  to
be transformed. [Interjections.] We are sweating so much every  day  to  try
and show them the way, but they are so hard to crack. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, the Bill before the House today  contributes  to
a move away from the legacy of the past, as Dr Nel has  said.  The  Act  was
passed by white men only; there  were  no  women  in  that  forum.  In  this
instance  it  deals  with  the  delinking  of  maternity  and   unemployment
benefits. The current position is that women drawing maternity benefits  use
up their unemployment benefits. This practice discriminates against women.

This Bill proposes that maternity and unemployment benefits be separated  so
that employees who go on maternity leave do so  without  having  to  deplete
their unemployment benefits. In support  of  this  Bill,  I  would  like  to
reiterate that this Government's  commitment  to  the  concept  of  equality
means more than treating all persons in the same  way.  Equal  treatment  of
persons in an  unequal  situation  will  perpetuate  rather  than  eradicate
injustice.

True equality between the different genders can  only  emerge  from  efforts
directed towards correcting these situational imbalances,  which  I  believe
this Bill has done enough to address. To combat gender-based  discrimination
we would like the Unemployment Insurance Board to be composed  of  both  men
and women, so as to recognise the importance  of  the  economic  and  social
contributions of women in this country.

This Bill also provides for a measure bringing  the  UIF  collection  regime
under the ambit of the functions of the SA Revenue Service and its  enabling
Act, the Income Tax Act of  1962.  This  will  address  the  high  level  of
employer default and  noncompliance  by  employers  by  introducing  tougher
penalties.
The UIF restructuring proposed in the Bill will,  inter  alia,  address  the
limited and nonviable nature of coverage, weak  enforcement  and  compliance
measures, the lack  of  financial  sustainability  and  development  of  the
fund's financial reserves,  the  rigid  benefits  structure,  discrimination
against certain categories of employees and  the  lack  of  a  comprehensive
database of contributors.

It  will  also  increase  compliance  by  requiring  employers   to   submit
declarations listing those in their  employ,  their  income  and  any  other
detail that may be prescribed in this default. [Interjections.]

This Bill provides, as  the  Minister  has  said,  that  these  benefits  be
accumulated up to and limited to 34 weeks in  any  given  four-year  period.
This means that it also provides a measure  that  will  eliminate  loopholes
that exist in the current Act.

In conclusion I must point out that this piece of  legislation  has  been  a
comparative analysis, based on international norms, and,  therefore,  we  in
the ANC proudly support the initiative [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Chairperson, I would like  to  mention
a point that was raised earlier, namely the  exclusion  of  state  employees
and domestic workers. The Bill provides for  the  Ministers  of  Labour,  of
Finance and for the Public Service and  Administration  to,  first  of  all,
investigate  the  possibility  of   including   civil   servants   and   the
implications thereof on the fiscus,  and  to  report  to  Parliament  within
seven months. The reason for this approach is that the  inclusion  of  civil
servants will result in the change of the remuneration  structure  of  civil
servants. Secondly, civil servants will  also  need  to  contribute  to  the
fund. For this reason it is important that such employees  be  consulted  at
the bargaining council.

Secondly, we are talking about the exclusion of domestic  workers.  Domestic
workers are not excluded. What is required  is  for  the  department  to  be
given 12 months to investigate the modalities of  collection  from  domestic
workers' employers and domestic workers themselves, given the unique  nature
of domestic workers.

I wanted to comment on this issue, but also to thank  all  the  members  who
have participated in this debate today. Yes, there will  be  some  questions
asked, but I do believe, even as an acting Minister, that the best thing  is
to move forward and add on whatever that needs to be added on,  but  not  to
break the process just to be spoilsports of some sort. Remember,  I  am  the
Minister of Sport. [Laughter.]

I believe that the parties that do not play ball as we expect them to,  need
to be taught what it is to play sport. Maybe they  will  understand,  later,
when they get tackled. Not that some of them are at an age  where  they  can
be tackled anyway. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.
The Council adjourned at 20:30

Papers:

1.    The Minister of Public Works:


     Written explanation, dated 12 November 2001,  from  the  Department  of
     Public Works in  terms  of  section  65(2)(a)  of  the  Public  Finance
     Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), setting out  the  reasons  why
     the  department  could  not  table  its  Annual  Report  and  Financial
     Statements for 2000-2001 in time:


     Dear Mr Mfenyana


     This Memorandum serves to inform the Parliament that the Department  of
     Public Works  is  unable  to  table  the  2001  annual  report  as  per
     provisions of section 40(1)(d) of the Public  Finance  Management  Act,
     1999 and Regulation 111J of the Public Service  Regulations,  1999  (as
     amended).


     National Treasury  Guidelines  for  Annual  Reporting  (December  2000)
     directs that the annual report should include  audit  reports.  Due  to
     outstanding issues, of material nature,  the  Auditor-General  has  not
     finalised the Department of Public Works' audit report.


     In view of the above, the tabling of  the  report  during  the  current
     sitting of Parliament is not possible.


     We hope for the Parliament's indulgence in this regard.


     Regards,


     TAMI SOKUTU

5.    Report of the Select Committee on Finance on  FFC  hearings,  dated  5
     November 2001:


     The Select Committee on Finance, having  conducted  hearings  with  the
     Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC), reports as follows:
     A.     Introduction


         This Report is an analysis of the debate  by  the  members  of  the
         Committee who attended hearings to discuss the  FFC  Submission  on
         the Division of Revenue for 2002-03. The FFC has been  mandated  by
         the Constitution, Chapter 13, to make  recommendations  as  to  how
         nationally collected revenue should be  divided  between  national,
         provincial and local government. In the  FFC's  latest  submission,
         June 2001, the emphasis has been placed on  formulating  policy  on
         the equitable division of revenue to local governments.


     B.     Provincial Revenue Powers


         This  section  of  the  FFC  submission  examines   approaches   to
         strengthening  provincial  tax  authority  to  meet   the   general
         constitutional requirements  and  the  general  principals  of  tax
         design. It leads to the devolution of  national  revenue  power  to
         provincial revenue autonomy. It is an issue which  has  raised  the
         most concerns in the FFC hearings in almost all of  the  provincial
         houses. Below is a list of concerns expressed and  debated  by  the
         members  present  at  the  FFC  hearings,  followed  by  a  general
         summation.


         1. The administration cost of a  decentralised  tax  authority  and
              fears of such cost being passed on to the local taxpayer.


         2.  Political  merits  of  decentralising  tax  authority  and  tax
              reliability,  with  accountability  of   these   decentralised
              levels.


         3. Fears of FFC recommendations creating  new  sources  of  revenue
              instead  of  exploiting  existing  sources,  alluding  to  the
              inefficiency of decentralising tax authorities and/or  to  the
              disincentives for provinces to fully exploit their own revenue
              potential.


         4.  Whether  the  Provincial  Tax  Regulation  Bill  satisfies  the
              constitutional requirements for regulating provincial  revenue
              powers.


         5. The  difficulty  of  implementing  an  equalisation  grant  when
              introducing provincial taxation.


         6. The gains in provincial revenue may be too small to  offset  the
              cost accrued in complicating the equitable share formula.


         Some of the concerns expressed above are all  issues  that  feature
         prominently in standard economic text on public finance  and  local
         government,  with  convincing  arguments  for   and   against   the
         decentralisation of revenue  powers  from  national  to  provincial
         government. The most talked about issue is the additional  cost  to
         the  tax-payer  due  to   the   collection   of   taxes   and   the
         administration to oversee such collection.


         Personal income tax by its nature is a broad-based income tax  with
         no substitutes and, in terms of  revenue,  is  the  most  efficient
         tax. In addition, the administration cost is minimal as  collection
         and distribution of personal income tax is  already  undertaken  by
         SARS. FFC recommendations that the  surcharge  on  personal  income
         tax be  identified  as  one  of  the  sources  of  provincial  tax,
         alleviate some of  the  problems  associated  with  additional  tax
         burdens placed on local authorities.


         Also, the FFC  recommendations  and  policy  stance  on  provincial
         revenue powers  are  subject  to  change,  pending  provincial  tax
         legislation. On this issue, nothing is yet categorical. For a  more
         detailed report of the consequences  of  revenue  decentralisation,
         refer to the Committee's Report on the Katz Commission Report.


     C.     Equitable Share Formulae and impact thereof


         The  formulae  developed  and  proposed  by   the   FCC,   is   for
         municipalities to  find  an  equilibrium  between  their  equitable
         share and the total  cost  of  all  service  responsibilities,  the
         maximum possible cost recovery and their revenue-raising  capacity.
         Points raised by members at the FFC hearing were:


         1. Provinces will be able to manipulate the formula  by  increasing
              CSR and decreasing CR and RRC and thus increasing their equity
              share.


         2. The interpretation of the constitutional  mandate  with  respect
              to basic services, i.e. what  is  to  be  implemented  in  the
              formula?
         3. The potential of municipalities  to  raise  their  own  revenue,
              which will be deducted from  their  equitable  share,  knowing
              that this  might  disadvantage  themselves  in  terms  of  the
              allocation from the national government.


         In regard to the formula and identification of  backlogs,  the  FFC
         has suggested that the  data  be  collected  nationally  to  expose
         inefficiency within municipalities. It is important  that  the  tax
         base  for  each  municipality  is   identified   to   ensure   that
         municipalities  maintain  efficiency  in  revenue  collection   and
         distribution in order to sustain equity share  equilibrium  in  the
         formula. This is also true  for  provincial  and  local  government
         formulae derived by the FFC.


     D.     Equitable Share: Income Disparity between Provinces


         In some districts the per capita income  from  regional  levies  is
         R10, while in others it is R1 000. This  is  not  only  because  of
         lack of revenue effort  but  also  because  of  a  lack  of  formal
         economic  activity  essential  for   broadening   the   tax   base,
         especially in the rural areas. The funding  of  basic  services  as
         suggested by the FFC should come  from  converted  regional  levies
         into a general revenue source and the  funding  for  infrastructure
         directly from national government.[4] This  is  in  agreement  with
         standard public finance theory, as the disparity between  provinces
         and municipalities in their ability to deliver free basic  services
         would  cause  people  to  vote  with  their  feet   and   move   to
         municipalities able  to  deliver  these  services.  Issues  raised,
         were:


         1. Economic activity  is  an  element  of  the  current  provincial
              formula: Eight per cent  of  the  provincial  equitable  share
              allocation consists of an "economic  output  share"  which  is
              based  on  the  distribution  of  total  remuneration  in  the
              country.


         2. Did the FFC model  take  into  account  the  skewed  development
              across provinces?


         3. The determination of capital grants in the capital  grant  model
              and the data to be used in asset compilation  of  the  various
              provinces.


     E.     Provincial and Municipal Borrowing


         Borrowing by provinces are  subject  to  the  Provincial  Borrowing
         Powers Act. While borrowing may be considered as a route to  tackle
         infrastructural backlogs, the temptation is there to subsidise  the
         tax-payer through this borrowing.


         The FFC suggest that long-term loans be at or near market rates  in
         order to entice the private sector into the market.  However,  this
         may be a bit  unrealistic,  as  a  market  discipline  approach  is
         almost unattainable on its own.


         The point was made that if provinces should borrow (Budget  Council
         agreed to no provincial borrowing at this stage), they should  have
         control over their revenue, as they are held accountable for  their
         borrowing  and  should  be  held  accountable   for   capital   and
         infrastructure development.


         Results of experiments conducted in respect of borrowing  by  local
         government suggest that municipallities  with  a  buoyant  tax  and
         transfer base tend to  finance  capital  expenditure  largely  from
         revenue.


         There is, however, problems  in  the  municipal  borrowing  sector,
         with  lenders  staying  out  of  the  market  due  to  factors   of
         uncertainty of  restructuring  and  redemarcation  processes  which
         have eroded the creditworthiness of some  municipalities.  However,
         if municipalities were dependant directly  and  entirely  upon  the
         financial markets, it  is  unlikely  that  they  would  have  equal
         access to loan finance. Smaller  and  poorer  municipalities  would
         probably have more difficulty in borrowing and would pay  more  for
         it.


         The nature of debt and its trends in  local  government  are  still
         under  investigation  by  the   National   Treasury,   and   debate
         continues.  The  Committee  is  anticipating  the  tabling  of  the
         Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill,  which  largely  deals   with
         financial management issues and borrowing by municipalities.


     F.     Free Basic Services


         There is a need for a guiding framework to define  constitutionally
         mandated basic services. The Committee  is  aware  that  government
         departments at all levels are unable to give an  indication  as  to
         how much it costs the government to provide a  particular  service.
         The Committee is of the view that this is important and  should  be
         thoroughly researched.


     G.     Health Care


         1. The FFC's proposal over the medium  term  is  to  determine  the
              proportion  of  primary  health  care  funding  allocated   to
              municipalities by  provinces,  and  to  ensure  that  this  is
              equitably distributed amongst municipalities.


     H.     Committee Comments


         1  The Committee endorses the view that  any  borrowing  should  be
              for capital projects or infrastructure development.


         2. The Committee proposes that the Department of Finance  considers
              the FFC proposal that there must be  a  framework  which  will
              guide the utilisation of the contingency reserves and which is
              informed by objective criteria.


         3. The Committee is concerned about the extent to  which  the  FFC,
              in their proposals, has taken  into  account  the  often  poor
              state of financial management capacity in the municipalities.


         4. Australia being used as a capital benchmark for  our  model  was
              raised  as  a  serious   concern,   since   the   social   and
              developmental conditions are not the same.


         5. What are the  terms  of  reference  within  which  the  FFC  are
              obliged to operate? Besides the FFC Act,  there  is  only  the
              Constitution and the Intergovernmental Relations Act, with  no
              other regulations governing FFC inputs.


         6. Provision  should  be  made  for  the  delivery  of  free  basic
              services.


     I.     Conclusion


         The  extent  to  which  provinces  make  use  of  or  discuss   FFC
         recommendations on a yearly  basis  is  questionable.  The  2003-04
         recommendations should be released  timeously  with  a  view  to  a
         smooth running process to ensure participation of legislatures  and
         local government.


         Amongst conceptual issues debated, was the constitutional  role  of
         the FFC, which stills seem to be vague. The  Committee  is  of  the
         opinion that the need is still there for a  thorough  understanding
         of the aims of the FFC,  i.e.  to  provide  a  fair  set  of  rules
         whereby provincial and local government is given an equal  starting
         point  from  which  to  maintain  an  equilibrium  in   local   and
         provincial government formulae. What this  fair  set  of  rules  is
         actually saying, is that  local  government  and  provinces  should
         equip  themselves  to  survive  the  market  forces  driving  their
         economies.


         Change is not often  easy.  It  is  these  markets,  with  all  its
         failures  to  deliver  on   public   goods,   which   will   ensure
         accountability, efficiency, optimal  allocation  of  resources  and
         good governance in the lower spheres  of  government  in  the  long
         run.


The Committee hopes that the 2001 census and other surveys will help to
give proper and adequate data for informed policy-making and to ensure
equitable distribution of resources.
