                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the  next  sitting
of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the following paragraph in the 1999 Election  Manifesto
       of the New NP:


       The New NP says  yes  to  government  where  provision  is  made  for
       multiparty  government  representing  all  communities,   and   where
       responsibility is shared to make South Africa work - where opposition
       parties are not  relegated  to  the  sterile  and  negative  role  of
       critics, but are regarded as constructive players  in  the  political
       system;


  (2) resolves that in a multi-ethnic  country  like  ours,  the  aforesaid
       political system is the best form of democracy in terms of which  all
       communities can  feel  part  of  the  processes  by  which  they  are
       governed, and in which everyone feels welcome  to  help  solve  South
       Africa's complex problems;


  (3) believes that  aggressive,  fight  back,  divisive,  winner-takes-all
       politics is not  appropriate  for  South  Africa  and  is,  in  fact,
       counterproductive  to  the   interests   of   voters   and   minority
       communities, and will not contribute to the solving of  the  problems
       of our country ...

[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  Mr  Matthee,
can you please take your seat? Hon members, we cannot expect  other  members
always to say what we want them to say. We are at  times  forced  to  listen
even to things that we do not want to hear.  [Interjections.]  Hon  Matthee,
please proceed.

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I continue:


  ... and will not contribute to the solving of the problems of our country
  such as crime, poverty, Aids and unemployment; and


  (4) also believes that the participatory model of  democracy,  which  has
       the quality of being completely responsive to all our citizens,  will
       help to bring back many  of  our  citizens  into  the  mainstream  of
       politics, where they can best contribute to the solution of the great
       questions that confront us all.

[Interjections.]

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson ... [Interjections.]

Bly jy stil as ek praat! [Tussenwerpsels.] [You keep  quiet  when  I  speak!
[Interjections.]]

Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting of the Council  I  shall
move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the decision by the Zimbabwean government  to  ban
       1 000 commercial farmers from working their fields;


  (2) further notes that this  is  in  total  contravention  of  the  Abuja
       agreement;


  (3)  believes  the  action  taken  by  the  Zimbabwean  president  to  be
       unconstitutional;


  (4) expresses concern as to the impact this decision  will  have  on  the
       already half a million food-starved Zimbabweans; and ...

Mr  A  E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  on  a  point  of  order:  It  is  not
parliamentary to move motions on behalf of, or against, other governments.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  It  is  notice
of a motion: It does not require our approval. Proceed, hon member.

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, could you ask that hon  member  please  to  stop
with his nonsense motions which he is always introducing.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! You are  eating
into your time, hon member.

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, I continue:


  (5) calls on the South African Government to use its regional  powers  to
       ensure that Zimbabwe keeps to its promise of orderly and  legal  land
       reform processes and to ensure an end to political violence in  order
       to boost investor confidence.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next  sitting  of  the
Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) calls upon the South African Police Service to make it compulsory for
       police officials to undergo post-traumatic stress counselling if they
       are exposed to traumatic stress in the line of duty;


  (2) notes that currently the medical aid allowance of R1 200 per annum is
       insufficient to allow police officials  to  undergo  the  appropriate
       counselling; and


  (3) further notes the personal tragedies that have occurred as  a  result
       of the absence of a proper post-traumatic counselling service.

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek  gee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die  volgende
sitting sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem -
       (a)  van  die  Nuwe  Nasionale  Party  se  teleurstelling  omdat  die
           soveelste  teikendatum  vir  die  goedkeuring  van   die   Suid-
           Afrikaanse Talewet nie gehaal is nie;


       (b)   dat  die  Nuwe  Nasionale  Party  die  Wes-Kaapse   Taalkomitee
           gelukwens met die aanvaarding van die  voorgestelde  provinsiale
           Talewet deur die Wes-Kaapse kabinet; en


       (c)  dat die Nuwe Nasionale Party alles in sy vermoë sal doen en alle
           instrumente tot sy beskikking sal gebruik om druk uit  te  oefen
           en behulpsaam te wees om die proses tot finaliteit te bring;


  (2) van mening is dat -


       (a)  Afrikaans en  ander  inheemse  taalgemeenskappe  nie  langer  in
           onsekerheid oor hul taalregte gevange gehou kan en mag word nie;


       (b)   die  Suid-Afrikaanse   Parlement   en   regeringsamptenare   se
           ongrondwetlike taalbeleid van alles Engels besig  is  om  in  te
           druis teen wêreldtendense waar veeltaligheid  en  die  erkenning
           van kleiner tale al hoe belangriker word; en


       (c)  die oordrewe gebruik van Engels nie die voortbestaan van Sepedi,
           Sesotho,  Setswana,  siSwati,  Tshivenda,  Xitsonga,  Afrikaans,
           isiNdebele, isiXhosa of isiZulu verder mag benadeel nie; en


  (3) kennis neem van mnr A E van Niekerk se uitnodiging aan  die  sprekers
       van bogenoemde tale saam met hom as taalombudsman 'n gesprekgroep wat
       veeltaligheid voorstaan hier in die Parlement te vorm en te  help  om
       die Parlement 'n vertoonvenster van veeltaligheid te maak en daardeur
       die trots vir die taal van ons voorvaders aan alle Suid-Afrikaners te
       demonstreer.


[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  at  the  next
sitting I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the New National Party's disappointment  because  the  umpteenth
           target date for the adoption of the South African languages  Act
           was not met;


       (b)  that the New  National  Party  congratulates  the  Western  Cape
           Language Committee on the adoption of  the  proposed  provincial
           languages Act by the Western Cape cabinet; and


       (c)  that the New National Party will do everything in its power  and
           use all instruments at its disposal  to bring pressure  to  bear
           and to be of assistance to bring the process to a conclusion;


  (2) is of the opinion that -


       (a)  Afrikaans and other indigenous linguistic  communities  can  and
           may no  longer  be  held  hostage  in  uncertainty  about  their
           language rights;


       (b)  the SA Parliament  and  government  officials'  unconstitutional
           language policy of having everything in  English  flies  in  the
           face  of  global  trends  in  which  multilingualism   and   the
           recognition  of  smaller  languages  are  becoming  increasingly
           important; and


       (c)  the excessive use of English must not further  adversely  affect
           the continued existence of Sepedi, Sesotho,  Setswana,  Siswati,
           Tshivenda, Xitsonga, Afrikaans, isiNdebele, isiXhosa or isiZulu;
           and


  (3) notes Mr A  E  van  Niekerk's  invitation  to  the  speakers  of  the
       aforementioned languages, together with him as language ombudsman, to
       form a discussion group advocating multilingualism here at Parliament
       and to assist in making Parliament a showcase of multilingualism, and
       in so doing to  demonstrate  to  all  South  Africans  pride  in  the
       language of our forefathers.

[Interjections.]]

Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, on a point of order.

Hierdie mosie van die agb lid is al oor en oor in hierdie Raad  gestel.  Kan
u asseblief kyk na die inhoud van hierdie mosie om te sien of  dit  enigsins
verskil van sy vorige mosies. [Tussenwerpsels.] [This  hon  member's  motion
has been put to this House on more than one occasion. Could you please  look
at the content of this motion to see whether it differs  somewhat  from  his
previous motions. [Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  members,
order! Please do not use the House. This is notice of a motion; it does  not
require anybody's approval.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK:  Voorsitter,  kan  ek  klaarmaak?  [Chairperson,  may  I
conclude?]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  Complete  your
motion, hon member. You have half a second.

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek herhaal net: Ek nooi  die  sprekers  van
bogenoemde   tale   om   saam   met   my   as    taalombudsman    'n    pro-
veeltaligheidsgesprekgroep hier in die Parlement te  vorm,  en  te  help  om
hierdie Parlement 'n vertoonvenster van veeltaligheid te maak,  en  daardeur
die trots vir die taal  van  ons  voorvaders  aan  alle  Suid-Afrikaners  te
demonstreer, en ek nooi die agb Theron uit om dit by te  woon.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I would just like to repeat: I invite  the
speakers of the aforementioned languages, together with myself  as  language
ombudsman,  to  form  a  pro-multilingualism  discussion   group   here   at
Parliament, and to help make this Parliament a showcase  of  multilingualism
and in so doing demonstrate the pride in the language of our forefathers  to
all South Africans, and I invite the hon Theron to attend.]

          INITIATIVES TO CLEAN UP AND STREAMLINE PUBLIC ENTERPRISES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the Minister of Public Enterprises on the bold step  he
       has taken by initiating a clean-up operation at Transnet,  especially
       in view of the heavy losses suffered by the national  airline  caused
       by ill-considered decisions and a lack  of  corrective  action  at  a
       level where one would have thought the  well-being  of  our  national
       carrier is of paramount importance; and


  (2) assures Minister Radebe of its support in any other similar moves  he
       may make  in  the  process  of  streamlining  and  updating  the  top
       financial and administrative management capacities of South  Africa's
       public enterprises.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson, I move without notice:

       being able to reach an agreement despite having  clung  initially  to
       their entrenched national positions;


  (2) congratulates China on its entry into the World  Trade  Organisation;
       and


  (3) further commends the WTO  for  the  declaration  assuring  developing

       will not be undermined by rules  protecting  rights  of  intellectual
       property.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its gratitude towards  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Arts,
       Culture,  Science  and  Technology  for  concluding  the  process  of

       and promoting language rights.]

                     MEDIUM-TERM BUDGET POLICY STATEMENT
Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister, hon  special  delegates,  hon
colleagues, on 1 November this year a Joint Budget  Committee  sat  for  the
first time in our Parliament's history, bringing  together  members  of  the
National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces.

The Joint Budget Committee began its life with a review of the 2001  Medium-
Term Budget  Policy  Statement.  In  forming  the  Joint  Budget  Committee,
Parliament  has  taken  a   quantum   leap   in   advancing   its   physical
responsibilities and oversight  role.  The  Joint  Budget  Committee  is  in
agreement with the gist of the 2001  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement.
The Joint Budget Committee acknowledges that  the  2001  Medium-Term  Budget
Policy Statement is consistent with Government's policy priority of  poverty
alleviation.

My participation in the Joint Budget Committee has taught me  a  lot.  Allow
me to share this with members. I am directing this also to the  Minister  of
Finance, in absentia, and to his Deputy. In England, the Chancellor, who  is
the equivalent of our  Minister  of  Finance,  presents  a  fairly  detailed
budget speech. Benjamin  Disraeli  delivered  the  shortest  speech,  in  45
minutes in 1867, but the longest ever was in  1853,  when  it  took  William
Gladstone almost five hours to deliver his speech.

Because of its length, the Chancellor may drink alcohol when delivering  the
budget speech - currently the only occasion on which alcohol is  allowed  in
the Chamber. Members  should  remember  that  I  am  referring  to  England.
Different Chancellors have shown a wide range of tastes in drink to  sustain
them while giving their budget speeches. For example,  Chancellor  U  Dalton
requested milk and rum, Dennis Harley requested brandy and  water,  and  Sir
George Hough requested gin and tonic. Perhaps our Minister should  submit  a
special request to the Speaker of the National  Assembly  before  delivering
his Budget Speech next year. [Laughter.]

In producing the 2001 Medium-Term Budget Policy  Statement,  Government  has
been mindful of the deterioration in the international economic  outlook  in
recent months. While remaining intensely mindful of our  Reconstruction  and
Development  Programme  objectives,  the  proposed  medium-term  expenditure
framework, as indicated in the 2001 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement,  is
a balanced response to social, economic and developmental challenges.
Spending on social services is estimated to rise by R5,5  billion  and  R7,5
billion for the outer years of the medium-term expenditure  framework.  This
allows for substantial real growth  over  the  medium  term  in  all  social
service functions,  including  provisions  for  the  Unemployment  Insurance
Fund.

Welfare spending will increase by 8,7% per annum. Spending  on  health  will
increase by 8,2% per annum. Additional spending on  the  integrated  justice
sector strengthens the capacity to fight crime. The  annual  average  growth
of 7,2% over the medium term for this  sector  includes  the  provision  for
phasing in 6 000 additional personnel in the South African  Police  Service.
This is ammunition to those  who  will  be  questioning  members  about  job
creation.

Strengthening social service provision over the medium term gives effect  to
Government's special focus on poverty alleviation. Social  services,  namely
schools and higher education, primary health  care  and  hospital  services,
social grants  and  welfare  services,  and  housing  play  a  key  role  in
improving economic and development opportunities and reducing  the  physical
and economic vulnerability of communities.
Additional resources allocated to the social service sector will  enable  us
to do the following. Firstly, it will enable us to increase  the  number  of
children benefiting from the child support grant, from 1 500 000 at  present
to 3 000 000 by the end of the fiscal year 2003. This should  not  encourage
irresponsible fathers to make children hoping that the Government will  take
care of them.

Secondly, the additional resources will enable the Department of  Health  to
cope  with  increased  health  needs  and  hospital  admissions  related  to
emerging communicable diseases such as Aids and malaria.

Thirdly, the additional resources will enable us to  expand  initiatives  to
improve the quality of  education,  through  strengthening  early  childhood
programmes and those aimed at learners with special needs.

Social security grants are effective mechanisms against  poverty,  providing
income support to more than 4 000  000  South  Africans  every  month.  More
specifically, Government has promoted delivery on  national  electrification
programmes as part of the integrated infrastructure development  initiatives
under the Reconstruction  and  Development  Programme.  The  electrification
programme, which aims at improving access to basic  electric  services,  has
surpassed its delivery target,  connecting  2  700  000  households  in  the
period 1994 to 1999. Viva the ANC Government, Viva!

In one of the communities around my village there is a place called  Mbamba-
mencisi, which in Xitsonga means that when it gets dark, one starts  looking
for matches. But now with the Government's programme, we have minimised  the
darkness in the villages, and that is why we are saying congratulations.

The next three-year programme will focus on connecting households  in  rural
areas. Already rural households are connected; only  a  few  are  left.  The
Minister of Finance calls this whole process, a huge ship, and  he  says  it
is difficult to turn this huge ship. [Time Expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!   Hon  Taabe,
before I proceed, would you apologise to  the  House  for  disregarding  the
Rules of the NCOP?

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, my sincerest apologies.

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister and colleagues, when one  is
on a long journey, wise people will advise that halfway  along  the  planned
route one should stop for a moment to look back and reflect on how  one  has
done so far, and to calculate whether  one's  resources  have  been  applied
judiciously up  to  that  point,  to  reflect  whether  one  has  sufficient
resources left to complete the journey  and  how  the  remaining  challenges
should be met, and only then to proceed on one's journey.

Dit was vir my 'n aangename voorreg om 'n lid van dié  parlement  se  eerste
gesamentlike begrotingskomitee te wees wat in  die  lewe  geroep  is  om  'n
integrale rol te speel in die skakeling tussen die uitvoerende gesag en  die
wetgewer in die aanloop tot die begroting vir volgende jaar. Ek het  beslis,
en ek is seker dat ek namens al my kollegas praat as ek dit sê,  met  dieper
insig aan die anderkant uitgekom.

Die onderliggende tema en breë beleidsvoorkeure in die samestelling van  die
huidige en bestedingsraamwerk vir die medium  termyn,  is  die  vermindering
van  armoede  ten   einde   ongelykhede   en   die   daarmee   gepaardgaande
kwesbaarheid, te verlig.

Slegs die tyd sal leer of ons daarin kon  slaag  om  dié  beleidsdoelwit  te
bereik. In dié stadium wil dit voorkom  asof  die  uitbreidingsgerigte  aard
van die begroting en die  voorneme  om  geld  beskikbaar  te  stel  wat  die
sosiale probleme van die minder gegoede en armer deel van ons bevolking  sal
aanpak, terwyl dit ekonomiese groei en  werkskepping  oor  die  medium-  tot
lang termyn stimuleer, die regte prioriteitsrigting is om in te slaan.

Die feit dat  die  minister  aangedui  het  dat  hy  nie  van  die  gestelde
inflasiedoelwit  van  3%  tot  6%  gaan  afwyk  nie,  is  'n  belangrike  en
lofwaardige aspek van die beleidsverklaring vir die medium  termyn,  en  dít
in 'n tyd waarin  die  gedepresieerde  rand  ingevoerde  kapitaalgoedere  al
duurder maak en Suid-Afrika se  mededingende  voordeel  in  die  uitvoermark
nadelig beïnvloed word. Ons hou saam met die minister asem op om te sien  of
sy voorspelling bewaarheid word.

Die herstrukturering van die Suid-Afrikaanse Inkomstediens tesame met  ander
hervormings, is daarvoor verantwoordelik dat groter inkomste  teen  'n  laer
belastingkoers ingesamel kon word. Dit het daartoe  gelei  dat  die  fiskale
posisie   verbeter   het   en   dat   daar    moontlikhede    vir    verdere
belastingverligting  vir  die  middel-  en  laer   inkomstegroepe   in   die
vooruitsig is.

Ek  wil  kortliks  verwys  na  ander  lofwaardige   prioriteite   wat,   ter
onderskraging van  die  reeds  genoemde  voorkeur  aan  die  verligting  van
armoede, in die beleidsverslag na vore tree.

Eerstens, 'n deurlopende beklemtoning van beleggings in en die onderhoud  en
rehabilitasie van infrastruktuur wat sal bydra tot die  land  se  vermoë  om
werk te skep en die ekonomiese groeivooruitsigte te versterk.

Tweedens, die baie belangrike punt van die  versterking  van  programme  wat
die impak van die MIV/Vigs-epidemie aanpak.

Derdens,  die  herbouing  van  plaaslike  bestuur  en   die   nakoming   van
ondernemings wat die lewering van gratis basiese dienste sal verseker.

Vierdens, die versterking van kapasiteit in die  sektor  vir  veiligheid  en
sekuriteit om misdaad te voorkom en te bestry.

Vyfdens,    die    herstrukturering     van     instellings     soos     die
Werkloosheidsversekeringsfonds en die Poskantoor om hulle in staat  te  stel
om dienslewering te verbeter.

Laastens, die deurlopende versterking  van  die  administratiewe  kapasiteit
van   die   belastingowerhede   en    die    skep    van    'n    finansiële
intelligensiesentrum om met die  wêreldwye  bestryding  van  geldwassery  te
help.

Die NNP kan hom met die mediumtermynbeleidsverslag vereenselwig.

Ek maak graag van die geleentheid gebruik om  die  Minister  van  Finansies,
die adjunkminister en hul  personeel  geluk  te  wens  met  'n  uitstekende,
deursigtige en gebruikersvriendelike dokument.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It was a pleasant privilege for me to be  a  member  of  this  Parliament's
first joint budget committee which was called  into  existence  to  play  an
integral role in  the  liaison  between  the  executive  authority  and  the
legislature in the run-up to the budget for next year. I  certainly,  and  I
am sure that I speak on behalf of all my colleagues when I  say  this,  came
out on the other side with greater insight.

The underlying theme and broad policy priority in  the  composition  of  the
current and spending framework for the  medium  term  is  the  reduction  of
poverty in order to reduce inequalities  and  the  vulnerability  associated
with them.

Only time will  tell  whether  we  were  able  to  succeed  in  this  policy
objective. At this stage  it  would  appear  that  the  extension-orientated
nature of the budget and the intention to make money  available  which  will
address the social problems of the less well-off and poorer  sector  of  our
population, while stimulating  economic  growth  and  job  creation  in  the
medium to long term, is the correct priority direction to take.

The fact that the Minister indicated that he is not going  to  deviate  from
the stated inflation objective of 3% to 6% is an important and  praiseworthy
aspect of the policy statement for the medium term, and that at  a  time  in
which the depreciated rand  is  making  imported  capital  goods  even  more
expensive and South Africa's competitive advantage in the export  market  is
being negatively affected. Together with the Minister  we  are  holding  our
breath to see whether his prediction will come true.

The restructuring of the South African Revenue Service, together with  other
reforms,  is  responsible  for  the  fact  that  greater  revenue  could  be
collected at a  lower  tax  rate.  This  has  led  to  the  fiscal  position
improving and the possibility for further tax  relief  for  the  middle  and
lower-income groups in future.

I want to refer briefly to other praiseworthy priorities which,  in  support
of the already mentioned priority of the reduction  of  poverty,  emerge  in
the policy report.

Firstly, a consistent emphasis on investments in  and  the  maintenance  and
rehabilitation of infrastructure which  will  contribute  to  the  country's
ability to create jobs and strengthen the economic growth prospects.

Secondly, the very important point about  the  strengthening  of  programmes
which will tackle the impact of the HIV/Aids epidemic.

Thirdly, the rebuilding of local government and the meeting of  undertakings
which will ensure the delivery of free basic services.

Fourthly, the  reinforcement  of  capacity  in  the  sector  of  safety  and
security, to prevent and combat crime.

Fifthly, the restructuring of institutions like the  Unemployment  Insurance
Fund and the Post Office to enable them to improve service delivery.

Finally, the continuous reinforcement of the administrative capacity of  the
tax authority and the creation of a financial intelligence centre to  assist
in the worldwide combating of money-laundering.

The NNP can identify itself with the medium-term policy statement.

I would like to take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  the  Minister  of
Finance, the Deputy Minister and their staff on an outstanding,  transparent
and user-friendly document. [Applause.]]

Ms B THOMSON:  Chairperson,  Deputy  Minister,  special  delegates  and  hon
members, we congratulate the Minister of Finance and the  officials  of  the
National Treasury for the excellent format of the  2001  Medium-Term  Budget
Policy Statement.

The Joint Budget Committee is pleased that the MTBPS process continues  with
an  emphasis   on   investment   and   infrastructural   growth.   It   also
differentiates  between   maintenance   of   existing   infrastructure   and
investment in new infrastructure. Expansion  of  infrastructure  could  only
create new employment prospects, thereby facilitating medium-  to  long-term
economic growth.

The Poverty Relief Fund provides  further  benefit  for  projects  aimed  at
alleviating the plight of the poor. Funding of  R1,5  billion  is  available
for projects that redress water resourcing, waste  management,  creating  of
infrastructure and protection of water  resources.  Infrastructure  projects
that are under way include crèches, community facilities, access  roads  and
water supply.

With regard to the building of schools, there has been a lack of  investment
in maintenance, and a large  number  of  schools  still  require  additional
repairs. The national Department of Education has established a  directorate
for physical planning in order to look into the spending  rates  of  various
provinces. The department will also establish means  of  ensuring  increases
in capital investment.

It must  be  borne  in  mind  that  education  and  training  are  long-term
investments which lay  the  foundation  for  an  improved  quality  of  life
through increased skills and  capabilities,  thereby  producing  a  positive
externality.  Externality  occurs  when  the  benefits   of   infrastructure
investment spill over to a wider population.

However,  with  the  inheritance  of  infrastructure   backlogs   especially
prevalent  in  housing,  health  and  education,  it  is  commendable   that
Government has undertaken to increase spending on infrastructure.

In the years ahead, several  investment  projects  such  as  water  projects
linked to Skuifraam  Dam,  road  linking  the  N4  north  of  Pretoria  with
Botswana and the gas pipeline from Mozambique to South  Africa,  to  name  a
few, will get under way. These investments in infrastrucural  projects  will
boost real public sector investment growth beyond the  budgetary  projection
of 8,8% per year and extend infrastructure services in  support  of  broader
social and economic development.

Delivery of any social  sector  commodity  would  simultaneously  require  a
supply of services such as water, electricity, roads and housing.  A  social
sector commodity cannot  be  provided  in  isolation.  For  instance,  roads
cannot be built leading to nowhere and houses should not  be  built  without
roads,  water,  electricity,  and  they  should  be  in  the  proximity   of
educational institutions.

The crucial element of any integrated strategy is  that  while  co-operation
is required within the social sectors, co-ordination amongst  the  different
spheres of government is equally necessary. There has to  be  both  vertical
and horizontal co-ordination simultaneously. This is the most daunting  task
confronting any government in transition and no blueprint  exists  for  such
undertaking.

The Joint Budget Committee is, however, concerned  about  the  lack  of  co-
ordination between Government  departments,  and  the  committee  would,  in
future,  recommend  inviting  national  departments  as  clusters   to   its
deliberations.

Ngibona ukuthi  lokho  kuyosiza  ukuze  omunye  umnyango  ungakhombi  omunye
esweni nomunye uvikele iso lawo.  [I  think  this  will  help  so  that  one
department does not point at another with it defending itself.]

With  reference  to  the  vertical  transfer  of  funds  from  national   to
provincial and  local  government,  Government  has  adjusted  the  vertical
equity share of the  spheres  of  government  to  enable  the  execution  of
spending priorities in favour of the poor.

A major challenge at provincial level is the provision of  social  services,
that is education,  welfare  and  health.  At  local  government  level  the
challenge is the delivery of  free  basic  services.  The  formula  for  the
horizontal division of the equitable share has been adjusted to reflect  the
shifts in spending on social services in provinces.

The weight of the  welfare  component  has  been  increased  by  1%  with  a
balancing reduction in the weight of economic components.  The  formula  has
also been updated to take account  of  the  average  provincial  educational
enrolment of the past three years.

The local government equitable share is projected to increase by an  average
of 13,9% per year over the medium term. The equitable share  is  distributed
to municipalities relative to the number of  households  in  poverty  within
their jurisdiction. The formula is targeted at households earning less  than
R1 100 a month, and aims to support the  delivery  of  a  basic  package  of
services including water, sanitation, energy and solid waste.

In conclusion, the division of revenue  set  out  in  the  2001  Medium-Term
Budget Policy Statement reflects the growth in  national  transfers  to  the
provincial  and  local  government  spheres.  The   increase   in   baseline
allocations for  the  provinces  allow  for  an  accelerated  infrastructure
development programme.
In the case of local government, increased allocation will  give  expression
to the provision of free basic services to households and also facilitate  a
smooth transition of the demarcation process. [Applause.]

Mnr J L THERON: Voorsitter, die titel van  my  toespraak  vanmiddag  is  The
long walk to economic growth and job creation. [Tussenwerpsels.] [Gelag.]

Die Minister van Finansies en die tesourie kan geluk  gewens  word  met  die
werk wat reeds gedoen is om die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie op  koers  te  kry.
'n Voorbeeld is die begrotingsbeleidsverklaring vir die  medium  termyn  wat
ons vandag debatteer. Dit  word  jaarliks  gedoen  om  groter  sekerheid  en
deursigtigheid te bewerkstellig. 'n Verdere voorbeeld  is  die  gesamentlike
parlementêre begrotingskomitee wat daarop ingestel is om ontledings te  doen
en bydraes tot die begrotingsproses te lewer. Sekere  grondliggende  aspekte
van die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie verg egter nog baie aandag,  en  daarom  my
titel The long walk to economic growth and  job  creation.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, the title of my speech this  afternoon  is  The
long walk to economic growth and job creation. [Interjections.] [Laughter.]

The Minister of Finance and the treasury  should  be  congratulated  on  the
work already done to get the South African economy on track. An  example  of
this is the budget  policy  statement  for  the  medium-term  which  we  are
debating today. This is  done  annually  to  ensure  greater  certainty  and
transparency. Another example is the Joint  Parliamentary  Budget  Committee
who are focused on doing analysis and making  contributions  to  the  budget
process. A few fundamental aspects of the South  African  economy,  however,
still deserves a lot of attention, and therefore my title The long  walk  to
economic growth and job creation.]

Firstly, I would like to look at the positive economic  fundamentals.  There
are a lot of possible aspects such as  the  objectives  in  the  Medium-Term
Budget Policy Statement, which we could  mention.  For  instance,  everybody
would agree on the objectives set out in the MTBPS, namely the reduction  of
poverty to alleviate the inequality and vulnerability and  greater  emphasis
on  investment  in  infrastructure  for   economic   growth;   strengthening
programmes that address the impact  of  the  HIV/Aids  pandemic;  rebuilding
local government and  meeting  commitments  to  ensure  free  basic  service
delivery; strengthening capacity  in  the  safety  and  security  sector  to
prevent and combat crime; the decision  to  take  a  holistic  view  of  the
taxation of  retirement  savings;  and,  lastly,  individuals  in  line  for
further tax relief, although we  should  not  forget  that  individuals  are
still very highly taxed in South Africa for what they receive in return.

Furthermore,  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  the  Deputy   Minister   have
confidence in the South  African  economy,  which  is  in  itself  positive.
However, in the joint budget committee the  following  was  also  mentioned.
Firstly, the strong fiscal position provides room for fiscal  policy  to  be
used to stimulate growth; secondly, the strong,  diversified  export  sector
performing well  owing  to  the  very  competitive  currency;  and  thirdly,
inflation is on a downward trend, meaning that we will not have to  hike  up
interest rates or run up foreign liabilities, such as in 1998.

Ek wil ook die probleemgebiede in die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie bespreek.  [I
would also like to discuss the problem areas in the South African economy.]

If we look at the other side, the long walk side, to balance the picture  of
the South African economy, the following could be mentioned:

Ek wil eerstens na ekonomiese groei kyk.  Groeikoerse  van  tussen  2,4%  en
3,7% per jaar mag realisties wees, gegewe  die  regering  se  ekonomiese  en
sosiale beleid, maar is  totaal  ontoereikend  vir  die  behoeftes  van  die
miljoene arm en werklose Suid-Afrikaners.

Suid-Afrikaanse  en  internasionale  ekonome  is  oortuig  daarvan  dat  ons
groeikoerse van meer as 6% kan bereik, maar  dit  blyk  dat  regeringsbeleid
nie hierin kan slaag nie. Soos bekend is die VSA in 'n resessie. Sowat  nege
maande later volg die res van die wêrelds  se  ekonomieë  gewoonlik  en  ons
volg dieselfde  patroon.  Indien  die  Suid-Afrikaanse  groeikoers  dus,  as
gevolg van  'n  wêreldwye  resessie  nog  verder  gaan  terugsak,  gaan  dit
ernstige ekonomiese en sosiale gevolge vir ons almal inhou.

Die MTBBV toon duidelik die rampspoedige  uitwerking  van  die  owerheid  se
privatiseringsproses wat heeltemal misluk het. Die een  geleentheid  na  die
ander gaan verlore om 'n doeltreffende privatiseringsprogram in te stel.

Die gesloer om Telkom- en M-selaandele te verkoop, beteken die inkomste  uit
privatisering sal vanjaar 83% minder wees en vir  die  driejaartydperk  2001
tot 2004, 18% minder. Die uitwerking hiervan is een  van  die  redes  waarom
die owerheid se leningsbehoeftes vanjaar met 128% tot R21,4  miljard  gestyg
het.

Die teleurstellings ten opsigte van die SAL en  die  poskantoor  sal  beslis
die vertroue in die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie beïnvloed.

Wat die tweede en derde vlakke van regering betref, lê daar beslis  ook  nog
'n lang pad  voor.  Wetgewing  word  tans  deur  die  parlement  gevoer  dat
provinsies belastings kan hef. Baie werk  sal  egter  nog  nodig  wees  voor
enige sukses behaal sal word.

Die Minister van Finansies het self in die begrotingskomitee gesê baie  werk
is nog op die derde vlak van regering nodig. Probleme op  dié  regeringsvlak
sluit in die druk  op  finansies  as  gevolg  van  gratis  dienste,  te  hoë
vergoeding van raadslede, hoë vlakke van verbruikerskuld as gevolg  van  die
wanbetaling  vir   dienste   en   die   beperkte   vermoë   van   die   nuwe
derdevlakowerhede  om  geld  reg   te   bestee   en   noodsaaklike   dienste
kostedoeltreffend te lewer.

Uit bogenoemde is dit duidelik dat die derde  vlak  van  regering  nog  baie
geld van nasionale  en  provinsiale  vlak  sal  nodig  hê  vir  noodsaaklike
dienslewering op grondvlak.

Ek wil afsluit. Uit dié prentjie  van  die  begrotingsbeleidsverklaring  vir
die medium termyn blyk die baie  positiewe  aspekte  waarmee  die  minister,
adjunkminister en departement gelukgewens kan word. Aan die  ander  kant  is
dit ook baie duidelik dat daar nog talle  ernstige  ekonomiese  probleme  is
wat aangepak moet  word.  Daar  lê  dus  nog  'n  lang  pad  voor  vir  hoër
ekonomiese groei en  groter  werkskepping  vir  die  ekonomiese  en  sosiale
welvaart van Suid-Afrika. [Applous.] (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Firstly, I would like to look at economic growth. Growth rates  of  between
2,4% and 3,7% per annum might be realistic, given the government's  economic
and social policy, but is totally inadequate for the needs of  the  millions
of poor and jobless South Africans.

South African and international economists are convinced of  the  fact  that
growth rates of more than 6% can be achieved, but is seems  that  government
policy cannot succeed in doing this. We all  know  that  the  USA  is  in  a
recession. Usually approximately nine months later the rest of  the  world's
economies will follow and we follow the  same  pattern.  Therefore,  if  the
South African  growth  rate  declines  even  further  as  a  result  of  the
worldwide recession it will have serious economic  and  social  implications
for all of us.

The  MTBPS  clearly  shows  the  disastrous  effects  of  the   government's
privatisation process which  has  failed  hopelessly.  The  one  opportunity
after the other is  being  lost  to  implement  an  effective  privatisation
programme.

The delay in  selling  Telkom  and  M-cell  shares  means  the  income  from
privatisation will be 83% less this year and 18% less  for  the  three  year
term 2001 to 2004. The effect  of  this  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  the
government's loan capacity this year has risen with 128% to R21,4 billion.
The disappointments with regard to SAA and the Post Office  will  definitely
influence the confidence in the South African economy.

With regard to the second and third levels of government, a very  long  road
still lies ahead. Legislation is currently being passed by  Parliament  that
provinces may raise their own taxes. However, a lot of work is still  needed
before any success can be achieved.

The Minister of Finance said in the budget committee that a lot of  work  is
still necessary on the third level of government. Problems at this level  of
government includes the pressure on finances as a result of  free  services,
the high remuneration of councillors, high levels  of  consumer  debt  as  a
result of the nonpayment of services and the limited  capacity  of  the  new
third level authorities to spend money properly  and  to  deliver  essential
services cost effectively.

From the abovementioned it is clear  that  the  third  level  of  government
still needs a lot of money from national and provincial level for  essential
service provision at grassroots level.
I wish to conclude. From this picture of the  budget  policy  statement  for
the medium term it seems there are  many  positive  aspects  for  which  the
Minister, Deputy Minister and department  could  be  congratulated.  On  the
other hand, however, it is  also  very  clear  that  there  are  still  many
serious economic problems which should be tackled.  A  long  road  therefore
still lies ahead for higher economic growth and  greater  job  creation  for
the economic and social wellbeing of South Africa. [Applause.]]

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister and the  House  at  large,  we
want to  thank  you,  Chairperson,  for  affording  us  the  opportunity  to
participate in this very important debate,  a  Debate  on  the  Medium  Term
Budget Policy Statement of Government.

It is important in that it gives us an opportunity to scrutinise or even  to
advise Government on the spending patterns in the medium  term.  The  ticket
on which the ANC Government was elected was that of bettering the  lives  of
our people. Whatever the Government does in the short term,  in  the  medium
term and even in the long term is informed by this commitment.

It is no mistake therefore, that Government identified  the  eradication  of
poverty as its priority and that that priority  can  be  alleviated  through
comprehensive programmes involving social services. It is therefore  fitting
that, in the medium term, Government will spend 58%  of  its  entire  Budget
annually on social services.

As we all  know,  the  greater  part  of  social  services'  function  is  a
competency of provincial governments. This money is  mainly  transferred  to
the provinces as part of their equitable share, and more than 80%  of  these
provincial equitable shares are spent  on  education,  health,  welfare  and
housing. The function of the  national  Government  in  this  regard  is  to
formulate relevant policies and to monitor adherence to  these  policies  by
the provincial governments as indicated in the MTEF.

The departments responsible for social  services  will  receive  a  sizeable
increase in their budget in the next three years to enable them to  live  up
to their challenges in improving the quality of life of our people.  I  want
to skim over the activities of these departments to give a bird's  eye  view
of what challenges each department faces and how each one of them  will  use
the added budget to address these problems in the medium term.

With regard to education, developed countries  and  those  who  are  on  the
developmental path know the eternal truth, which is that the best  long-term
investment that a country can make is an  investment  in  human  brains.  To
illustrate this, I want to use Japan as an example.

Japan, as hon members know, is a small country with  no  mineral  resources.
After the Second World War in  the  1960s  this  country  was  poor  and  it
produced products of very low quality, to such an  extent  that  if  anybody
had anything perceived to be of low quality, it used to be  referred  to  as
``Japan''.

Today it is one of the strongest economies in the world because it took  the
right decision, that is to invest in the grey matter between people's  ears.
To further illustrate what we are saying, I will  relate  a  small  episode.
There is a country in this world - there is no need to make mention  of  its
name because I like it very much -  which  produces  very  big  and  massive
trucks. Japan imports lots and lots of these trucks.  But  when  politicians
from this country went to Japan, they could not see a single  one  of  these
trucks on the roads.

They wondered what the Japanese were  doing  with  these  trucks,  and  they
launched an investigation. They discovered that when these trucks arrive  in
Japan, after removing the wheels, the Japanese throw the whole  truck  in  a
furnace so as to produce steel in order to make their own cars.

I am saying that Japan is so developed that it sees raw materials  in  other
countries' finished goods. [Laughter.] We are saying therefore  that  it  is
for that reasons that in South Africa we have to - and we  have  done  so  -
put the lion's share of social services' funds into education.

The additional funds for education in  the  MTEF  will  go  a  long  way  in
improving the quality of education in our country, be  it  in  the  form  of
additional  classrooms,  provision  of  sanitation,  electricity,   learning
material, early childhood development, etc.

Let us look at health. Many, many years ago when I was in  Form  1,  I  came
across a book which I loved very  much,  called  A  Student's  Companion.  I
memorised one idiom from A Student's  Companion  which  I  still  love  even
today, which says: mens sana in corpore sano - a healthy mind in  a  healthy
body. [Interjections.] Government has a responsibility to see to it that  we
have a healthy nation. That is why  health  services  is  an  important  and
integral part of social services, and has been identified by  Government  as
a priority. This is necessitated by the fact that the  greater  majority  of
our people do not belong to medical schemes and they rely on  public  health
services.

The additional funds that this sector will get in the MTEF will address  the
ever-increasing demands of the health services. This problem  is  compounded
by the fact that in recent years more people were admitted to hospitals  due
to communicable diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis,  malaria,  etc,  as  the
Minister of Finance stated in his MTBPS.

Regarding social services, we said  earlier  that  the  ultimate  answer  in
eradicating poverty and banishing hunger, disease and ignorance  is  through
educating and skilling the nation. But we cannot, in the meantime, fold  our
arms and wait for the positive outputs of our investment  in  education.  In
the meantime, the Government has put  in  place  poverty  relief  programmes
that put to shame even some  of  the  countries  that  are  relatively  more
developed than we are. We can therefore, as a country, pat ourselves on  the
back for being a caring nation.

Over and above the programmes  that  we  have  referred  to,  through  other
departments, Government has put in place an integrated strategy  that  deals
with the whole question of HIV/Aids. The strategy  focuses  on  giving  care
and support for children and youth affected by this disease by  implementing
life-skills programmes in schools,  voluntary  testing  and  counselling  of
victims and home-based care. All these welfare  programmes  are  responsible
for  the  rising  welfare  spending  of  about  8,7%  in  the  medium  term.
[Interjections.]

With the relaxation of influx control laws and the advent  of  democracy  in
1994, we saw the exodus of people from rural  areas  to  towns  and  cities.
This resulted in the mushrooming of many more  informal  settlements  around
our towns and cities. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr J P GELDERBLOM:  Chairperson,  I  am  grateful  for  the  opportunity  to
participate in the debate on the 2001 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement.
In the first instance, it would be appropriate to congratulate the  National
Treasury on its ongoing efforts to enhance transparency, accountability  and
political oversight of the Budget process.

Although the general direction of the Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement
can be supported, allow me to use this opportunity to single out an area  of
concern. I am referring to the question of funding of tertiary services  and
training - conditional grants for central hospitals, training  and  research
grants - in the health sector, discussed on pages  79,  80  and  81  of  the
policy statement, and, in particular, the redistribution of funds  from  the
Western Cape and Gauteng provinces.

It is not my intention  to  debate  the  principle  of  redistribution,  but
rather the inadequate time allowed for adjusting  to  the  lower  levels  of
funding  within  which  the  central  hospital  will  need  to  deliver  its
services. The policy statement provides that  it  be  phased  in  over  five
years. I have been given to understand that this is  a  compromise  solution
between the original National Treasury stance and that  which  is  advocated
by the Minister of Health who is asking for a period of three years.
The danger of short phase-in periods is that an inequitable situation  might
arise due to the overall lowering of the availability  of  health  services,
as such  services  will  not  necessarily  follow  the  shifting  of  funds.
Combined with substantial spending pressures or liabilities  resulting  from
the rapid take-up rate for  the  child  support  grant  and  other  national
initiatives, and given the fact that there is no clear  indication  at  what
level and time the former will stabilise, a more realistic  phase-in  period
for affected provinces would be at least eight years.

To mention but a few,  the  adjustment  to  lower  levels  of  funding  will
require another remix  of  resources  to  deliver  services  at  all  health
levels, causing instability within the system if not  properly  managed;  an
attempt at attaining the appropriate human resource skills mix  at  tertiary
and other institutions, which once again will be  hampered  by  the  hiring,
firing and redeployment of resources through mechanisms currently  operating
in  the  Public  Service;  revision  of  infrastructure  provision   through
adaptation; greater urgency  on  the  roll  out  of  management  information
systems; adequate provisioning of equipment;  institutional  re-engineering;
building capacity in receiving institutions; and redirection of budgets.
What is our  greater  concern  is  the  required  management  of  the  human
resources in the absence of a labour agreed upon,  affordable  and  flexible
tool. To date, I have not had the pleasure of seeing such a  tool,  although
personnel expenditure  is  estimated  to  represent  43,8%  of  consolidated
national and provincial expenditure, as stated on  page  72  of  the  policy
statement.

Moving beyond the policy statement another issue that needs to be raised  is
the development of  adequate  performance  indicators  to  enable  us  as  a
country to intelligently and objectively  assess  how  well  we  are  really
doing compared to our competitors in the critical  field  of  education  and
training, technology development and  application,  physical  infrastructure
and maintenance, health services and reducing inequality.

It seems to me that we have many nice-sounding policy statements  which  one
can fully support, but with  very  little  feedback  to  Parliament  on  the
degree of  success  of  their  implementation  and  the  attainment  of  the
different goals set in such policy statements. [Applause.]

Mr T  RALANE:  Chairperson,  Deputy  Minister,  special  delegates  and  hon
members, I endorse the views of my colleagues  and  friends  that  the  2001
Medium-Term  Budget  Policy   Statement   is   well   presented   and   very
comprehensive.  Moreover,  the  statement  before  this  House   demystifies
finance, thereby  making  key  financial  concepts  and  terminology  easily
accessible to the man in the street who is  assumed  to  be  uninitiated  in
financial matters.

Before I continue, I want to explain why finance is so intimidating.

A mathematician, an accountant and an economist apply for the same job.  The
interviewer calls in the mathematician and asks, ``What does  two  plus  two
equal?''.  The  mathematician  replies,  ``Four.''  The  interviewer   asks,
``Four, exactly?'' The mathematician looks at the interviewer  incredulously
and says, ``Yes, four exactly.''

Then the interviewer calls in the accountant and  asks  the  same  question.
The accountant says, ``On average, four, give or take 10%, but  on  average,
four.''

Then the interviewer calls the economist and poses the  same  question.  The
economist gets up, locks the door, closes the shades, sits down next to  the
interviewer and says, ``What do you want it to equal?'' [Laughter.]

On a more serious note, the MTBPS is  progressive  and  continues  with  the
objectives of our new democracy. Its progressive tendency  is  reflected  in
our tax policy and morale. Since 1994 Government  has  brought  the  company
tax rate down from 40% to 30%. The personal  tax  rate  structure  has  also
been revised each year, bringing substantial relief to  all  taxpayers,  and
particularly to lower-and middle-income taxpayers.

The 2001 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement tells us that the  2002  Budget
will again bring tax relief to individuals in  the  lower-and  middle-income
brackets. More importantly, we can expect in the next Budget a narrowing  of
the gap between the top marginal income tax rate and the company tax rate.

The 2001 MTBPS indicates that over the next year, Government will  undertake
a holistic review of the taxation of retirement  savings,  as  committed  to
Parliament during the deliberations on the 2001 Budget. In developing a  tax
regime for retirement savings, Government will be guided  by  the  following
principles,  firstly,  encouraging  savings;  secondly,  facilitating   post
retirement income security; thirdly, equity in the overall  distribution  of
Government resources allocated for retirement provision, including  the  old
age grant and tax expenditures for retirement savings, fourthly,  efficiency
and  neutrality  in  the  allocation  of  the  nation's  savings,   fifthly,
controlling tax avoidance opportunities; and, lastly, revenue stability  and
accountability for the provision of tax expenditures.

The redistributive or welfare role of the central fiscus  is  best  observed
by the tax exempt status awarded to public benefit organisations which  play
a decisive role in promoting  democracy,  fighting  poverty  and  delivering
vital social services to the people of South Africa. The tax  exempt  status
of public benefit organisations  allow  taxpayers  to  make  tax  deductible
donations. Government released a list of public benefit activities  that  an
organisation could engage in to be awarded the tax exempt status.

We are pleased to learn from the 2001 MTBPS that  Government  will  continue
to engage stakeholders to  identify  additional  public  benefit  activities
that should benefit  from  the  tax  privileges.  We  commend  the  National
Treasury for leading the fight against poverty.

The Budget committee  acknowledges  that  our  tax  system  has  experienced
substantial structural changes  over  the  past  few  years.  These  changes
include  the  following,  firstly,  broadening  the  tax   base;   secondly,
strengthening the overall  revenue  system;  thirdly,  entrenchment  of  the
principle  of  equity   to   enhance   taxpayer   morale;   and,   fourthly,
administrative reforms to ensure a stable tax revenue base.

With these few comments the  Budget  committee  congratulates  the  National
Treasury on a job well done. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I welcome the hon the Deputy  Minister
of Finance into the Chamber. I am not sure whether he  is  a  mathematician,
an accountant or an economist. [Laughter.] I call upon him  to  address  the
House.
The DEPUTY  MINISTER  OF  FINANCE:  Chairperson,  I  am  definitely  not  an
accountant. [Laughter.]

Once  again  I  would  like  to  thank  members  of  the  House  for   their
participation in this debate and for  their  enthusiastic  support  for  the
Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement. I must say that we really see  this  as
part of the comprehensive reform of  our  budgeting  system  that  has  been
unfolding in the country. The advent of the budget committee is yet  another
step in that unfolding reform of our budgeting system.

At the end of the day this must be about enhancing the  political  oversight
of Parliament over what we do in the executive  and  in  particular  how  we
deal with matters of how we allocate the  nation's  resources  and  for  the
purposes we allocate them. An important point in that regard is  that  there
is a series of documents that we table in Parliament, and at the end of  the
day it is going to be the ability to utilise those  documents  in  a  manner
that enables Parliament to  give  guidance  in  terms  of  areas  that  need
attention regarding how we allocate the resources of the nation  which  will
determine our success.

We tabled the Estimates of National Expenditure  in  which  each  department
outlines its policy priorities and programmes for the next three  years.  It
must be against that background that we  should  be  able  to  evaluate  the
annual budgets that departments get.

We also tabled the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review which looks at  the  past
three years to see how we have allocated our resources  and  the  impact  of
that in the different areas.

The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, against what is  contained  in  the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review, should also enable members  of  Parliament,
when looking at the past three years, as  we  do  in  the  Intergovernmental
Fiscal Review, to identify and factor that in as we engage with the  Medium-
Term Budget Policy Statement.

Generally, it is quite clear that with the challenges that  are  facing  the
country, and with the policy priorities that  we  have  identified  that  we
have to effect shifts that will see, over the medium  term,  more  resources
going towards provinces and local government, and if we take  this  together
with the fact that part of the focus in the coming year is going  to  be  on
fighting poverty and vulnerability it is therefore  relevant  to  us  to  be
allocating more resources towards provinces  and  local  government  because
one of the most effective weapons that are available to us to fight  poverty
and vulnerability is through our system of social grants. This,  in  a  way,
is a unique  instrument  that  is  available  to  us  which  is  not  widely
available in countries that are comparable to us.

It is our way of protecting the weak members of our  society,  and  this  is
one of the areas that we need to strengthen as we seek to fight poverty  and
vulnerability. There is also the fact that provinces have got to focus  more
on issues of rehabilitation and construction of new infrastructure.

Local authorities, and the extension of services  to  areas  that  have  not
been covered before to provide the free basic services  all  require  us  to
ensure that we support those particular processes with  increased  resources
towards provinces and local government.

Of course, there are particular challenges in local government. In a way,  I
think the challenges that are facing local government are really about  some
of the basic building blocks so that  the  local  authorities  are  able  to
deliver basic services efficiently; they are able to  bill  people  properly
for services that they receive and they are  able  to  collect  the  revenue
that is due to them, because this is biggest source  of  funding  for  local
authorities, as opposed to the provinces, where the greater portion  of  the
funding comes from the equitable share.

I just want to pick up on a few of  the  points  that  were  raised  by  hon
members. I want to tell the hon Nkuna it is indeed a  huge  ship,  which  is
difficult to turn around, but I think that when we look at the past  period,
we can say with confidence that we are succeeding in ensuring  that  at  all
these levels at which we operate, and at  which  our  system  of  democratic
government operates - national, provincial and local - we are succeeding  in
ensuring that we are all moving in step with each other.

One of the important issues about this budget policy statement is  that  all
of the Governments at national, province and local level will  be  preparing
their budgets  for  2002  based  on  the  policy  priorities  that  we  have
identified, and these policy priorities are not sucked out of our thumbs  on
our part, but they are based on a widely consultative process at all  levels
- at national, with the provinces and with local government. So  all  of  us
will be addressing common priorities. I think it is important,  as  we  turn
this ship around, also to make sure that all  of  its  parts  are  basically
moving in the same direction.

Instead of starting with those raised by the hon Conroy,  perhaps  I  should
start with the points raised by the hon Theron. Indeed, it is  a  long  walk
to economic freedom, economic growth, and economic development. I think  the
important thing is that, and this is part of what we have learned  over  the
past few years, success comes with consistency,  persistence  and  sometimes
we also need to be bold in tackling the things  that  need  to  be  done.  I
think that that lesson from what we have done so far should  really  sustain
us as we seek to challenge the greatest achievement of the past  five  years
or so, which has been the stabilising of our economy at the macro level.

The challenge that faces us now is those  microeconomic  reforms  that  will
make our economy function and that will enable the economy  to  create  jobs
and enable people to establish  enterprises  and  economic  activities  that
will  enable  them  to  generate  income  for  themselves.  This   is   what
microeconomic reform is all about - it  is  about  getting  the  economy  to
function.

The persistence and the consistency that has served us well  over  the  past
five years should also see us exercising the same kind of consistency as  we
seek to  challenge  some  of  those  micro-economic  reforms.  Part  of  the
confidence  that  we  have  in  our  economy  arises  from  some  of   those
achievements of the past - a strong fiscal position  and  an  export  sector
that is growing and that is diverse. This is quite different from the  South
Africa that depended largely on the export  of  raw  commodities,  where  we
mined gold and exported it.

A more diverse export basket is one of the  important  achievements  of  the
past seven years. I wish to tell the hon Conroy that  the  issue  about  our
exchange rate and depreciation is that there are potential negatives.  There
is the potential to import inflation, because some of things that we  import
are used as inputs into goods that we produce for export  purposes,  and  so
on.

There is that potential, but I think that the positive side is that  it  has
indeed seen very substantial growth in the exports of South Africa.  In  the
first six months of this year we have enjoyed a 10% growth in  our  exports,
and a 50% growth in our exports to the European Union. That  is  partly  the
result of the depreciation of our exchange rate. So, we must not always  see
the negative side of the depreciation of our currency.

Indeed, we have to invest in our future. Investment in our  future  must  be
about investing in the human training, as the hon Tolo said. It is the  best
thing we can do to address a host of challenges. A skills  shortage  is  one
of the structural weaknesses of the South African economy and what it  means
is that we must use all avenues and opportunities to  train  and  train  our
people, and so our basic schooling system  must  function  better,  and  the
Setas that we are  establishing  must  function  better.  We  must  use  all
opportunities and we must address some of the patterns which are  historical
to our country in  terms  of  access  to  education,  particularly  tertiary
education, and access to some of the highly specialised areas of knowledge.

I was talking to Prof Njabulo Ndebele yesterday and I was  quite  encouraged
when he told me about some of the trends  that  are  beginning  to  manifest
themselves at the University of  Cape  Town,  because  they  are  addressing
exactly those issues of access to tertiary education, but also of access  to
some of the key specialised areas of knowledge.

On the issue of tertiary services and the funding thereof raised by the  hon
Gelderblom, this is a challenge that we have to continue  to  grapple  with,
because the reality is that whilst most of our  tertiary  hospital  services
are concentrated in the Western Cape  and  Gauteng,  one  finds  that  other
provinces do have tertiary services as well  which  we  have  not  supported
adequately. It is an imbalance which we continue to grapple  with  in  order
to bring about a correction. As we do that, of course,  we  must  do  it  in
such a way that it does not impact negatively on some of our most  important
tertiary health facilities. It is really a matter of  balancing,  and  hence
the talk about phasing in whatever we need to do in that particular  regard.


I think perhaps I should end, on this note, and that is that I  will  convey
the choice that is available to the  Minister  of  Finance  for  his  Budget
Speech next year. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  I  am  sure  the

                     REVENUE LAWS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr H T SOGONI: Chairperson, Deputy Minister of Finance,  special  delegates,
hon  members,  I  represent  the  Chairperson  and  members  of  the  Select
Committee on Finance. I would like to make the following statement and  also
to urge hon members to support the Revenue Laws Second Amendment Bill.
Before doing so, allow me to convey a sincere word of gratitude to  the  hon
the Minister of Finance  and  his  department  for  patiently  and  expertly
taking us through the briefing sessions on this comprehensive and  technical
but very important legislation. With the help of the  Ministry  of  Finance,
the select committee managed to reduce a Bill of 132 pages into  this  brief
statement,  which,  however,  still  make  sense  of  what  the  legislation
contains in broad outline.

The committee further expresses sincere appreciation of the  valuable  input
also made by various stakeholders in their submissions during  the  in-depth
yet  constructive  and  objective  interrogation  to  which  the  Bill   was
subjected. The Bill introduces  amendments  to  most  of  the  revenue  laws
administered  by  the  Commissioner  for  the  SA  Revenue  Service.   These
amendments can be divided into several broad categories.

Sars has embarked on a process of restructuring its  operations  to  improve
collections and client service. This will fundamentally change  the  way  in
which Sars does business, and as a result various references in the  revenue
laws such as ``Receiver of Revenue'' have become obsolete. These  provisions
are updated to accommodate Sars's new structure.

On dispute resolution, the existing  objection  and  appeal  procedures  are
replaced by more streamlined procedures. The provisions of  the  Income  Tax
Act of 1962 are amended to enable the setting of rules that will  deal  with
the dispute resolution process from objection to the final procedures to  be
followed in the tax court. These procedures will apply  in  respect  of  all
the Acts administered by  the  commissioner,  other  than  the  Customs  and
Excise Act of 1964. However, the Bill also amends this Act to introduce  new
internal dispute resolution procedures.

A recent court decision held that a manufacturer  of  motor  vehicles  could
dispose of motor vehicles manufactured for and  used  by  employees  on  the
basis that these motor vehicles were not trading  stock  and  therefore  not
taxable. Accordingly, the Bill provides for an amendment to ensure that  the
proceeds of the disposal of all assets similar to those assets  manufactured
for resale are included in gross income.

Another court decision held that  it  is  possible  to  dispose  of  mineral
rights without triggering a recoupment of capital allowances in  respect  of
the associated capital assets. The  recoupment  provisions  are  amended  to
address this deficiency and to pre-empt disputes in closely related cases.

With the introduction of the residence basis of taxation  with  effect  from
the beginning of this year,  2001,  the  concept  of  a  controlled  foreign
entity or CFE has  become  more  important  in  South  Africa's  income  tax
system. In short, a CFE is a foreign  company  or  similar  entity  that  is
controlled by South African residents. The income of  that  company  may  be
attributed to the residents  under  certain  circumstances  to  prevent  tax
avoidance.

A number of amendments are proposed, the most  important  of  which  is  the
participation exemption in respect of the disposal of  one  CFE  by  another
CFE. This means that where a CFE holds more than a 25% interest in a  second
CFE, a dividend from or capital gain or disposal of the second CFE  will  be
exempted from tax. This will clear the  way  for  South  African  groups  to
restructure their foreign operations and to expand them.
As part of the work done in respect of foreign currency  and  capital  gains
tax, the ordinary income tax  provisions  in  respect  of  foreign  currency
gains or losses have  been  revisited.  The  Bill  integrates  the  ordinary
income tax provisions more closely with the capital  gains  tax  provisions.
One important change to the capital gains tax  provisions  is  that  foreign
currency gains on the disposal of foreign currency  equity  instruments  are
now subject to tax.

This ensures that an artificial  incentive  is  not  created  to  invest  in
offshore equities to the detriment of domestic equities. There are  existing
measures for certain forms of corporate restructuring, which permit a  group
of companies to restructure their operations to improve business  efficiency
free of tax. These measures  are  deficient  in  certain  respects,  amongst
which is the fact that they do not cater for capital  gains  tax.  The  Bill
corrects this situation by repealing these measures and inserting  new  ones
to permit tax-free restructuring by  domestic  companies,  as  long  as  the
shareholders  continue  to  have  a  substantial  interest  in  the   assets
transferred.

Unfortunately, international experience has shown that  these  measures  are
often abused to avoid tax. So a number of anti-avoidance rules have  had  to
be included. In order to simplify matters, though, many of these rules  fall
away after a period of 18 months. A number of amendments have been  made  to
correct  textual  errors,  close  minor  loopholes   and   provide   greater
certainty. The Bill introduces amendments to enhance control over  goods  in
state warehouses and over goods that enter or transit through the  Republic.
Goods that have been imported in contravention of  law  may  also  be  sold,
destroyed  or  distributed  to  indigent  persons  or  victims  of   natural
disasters under certain circumstances.

Following a court decision that an expropriation is not  a  supply  for  Vat
purposes, the Act is amended to ensure a Vat vendor treats an  expropriation
as a supply for VAT purposes. The definition of a  welfare  organisation  is
also brought into line with the public benefit organisation,  as  introduced
in the Income Tax Act of 1962. Other amendments are  also  made  to  improve
record keeping, encourage  e-filing  of  Vat  returns  and  to  enhance  the
administration of Vat by customs.

In  conclusion,  these  are  some  of  the  all-important  aspects  of   the
amendments contained in the Bill hereby submitted. Once more, on the  behalf
of the Select Committee on Finance, I urge the House to  support  the  Bill.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Declaration of vote:

Dr E A CONROY: Mevrou die Voorsitter, in enige huishouding is dit  nodig  om
by tye skoon te maak, om orde te skep, los drade op te tel  en  bymekaar  te
bring.

Die Wysigingswetsontwerp op Inkomstewette, 2000, wat ons laat  verlede  jaar
bespreek het, en die aantal wysigings aan die inkomstewette wat vanjaar  ter
sprake gekom het, het dit nou genoodsaak dat orde  met  behulp  van  hierdie
Tweede Wysigingswetsontwerp op Inkomstewette geskep word.

Die Nuwe NP steun hierdie wysigingswetsontwerp met die  voorbehoud  dat  ons
nié   saamstem   met   die   wysigings   wat   deur   die   instelling   van
kapitaalwinsbelasting genoodsaak word nie, aangesien ons  beswaar  teen  die
instelling van KWB reeds by 'n vorige geleentheid geboekstaaf is.  Die  Nuwe
NP is steeds van mening  dat  KWB  'n  onnodige  belasting  is  waarvan  die
inkomste nie die administrasiekoste sal regverdig nie, en dat  dit  ingestel
is in 'n stadium waarop ander lande reeds besig is om dit  as  'n  bron  van
inkomste uit te faseer. (Translation of declaration of vote follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Madam Chair, in any household it is necessary, at times,  to
create order, to pick up loose threads and bring them together.

The Revenue Laws Amendment Bill, 2000, which we  debated,  late  last  year,
and the number of amendments that have come under discussion this year  have
now necessitated the creation of order by way of this  Revenue  Laws  Second
Amendment Bill.

The New NP supports this Bill with the proviso that we  do  not  agree  with
the amendments that have been occasioned through the  carrying  into  effect
of capital gains tax, because our objection to the introduction of  CGT  has
already been recorded on a previous occasion. The New NP  is  still  of  the
opinion that CGT is an  unnecessary  tax  of  which  the  revenue  will  not
justify the administrative costs, and that it has been introduced at a  time
when other countries are already phasing it out as a source of revenue.]

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

     CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The  DEPUTY   MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson, this is the second Constitution amending Bill being dealt  with
within a short space of time by this House. The first one being, of  course,
the Constitution amending Bill which was debated on 30 October 2001.

Hon members of this House will recall that on  that  occasion  the  Minister
referred to this Bill, which deals exclusively with  financial  matters  and
which needs to be approved by both this House and the National Assembly,  in
terms of section 74(3) of the Constitution.
The National Treasury has been involved in a process of  reviewing  national
legislation on financial matters.  That  review  has  revealed  a  range  of
difficulties, both  legal  and  practical,  in  the  implementation  of  the
financial legislative regime contemplated in the Constitution.

The legislative review undertaken by the national  Treasury  has  emphasised
the need for a comprehensive, transparent, coherent and  accountable  budget
process. To ensure this, it is proposed that, firstly, sections 77  and  120
of the Constitution be amended to extend the definition of the  money  Bill,
to include Bills that abolish or reduce, or  grant  exemptions  from  taxes,
levies, duties or surcharges.

Secondly, section 73  is  amended  to  add  the  Division  of  Revenue  Bill
envisaged in section 214 to the list of legislation to be introduced in  the
National Assembly by the Minister of Finance only.

The amendment of section 73 takes into account what is really  provided  for
in the Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Act. It also  takes  into  account
the fact that budget legislation consists not only of  tax  legislation  and
Appropriation  Bills,  but  also  of  legislation  that  provides  for   the
equitable sharing of revenue raised nationally.

Section 216 is amended, firstly,  to  remove  the  words  that  obscure  the
content of the national Treasury by  wrongly  suggesting  that  the  Cabinet
member responsible for national financial matters  is  not  a  part  of  the
National Treasury, when, in fact, that Cabinet member is in law the head  of
the National Treasury and  the  functionary  in  which  the  power  and  the
authority of the National Treasury vests.

Secondly, the amendment makes it clear  that  stopping  funds  in  terms  of
section 216(2) is a mechanism  to  enforce  prescribed  Treasury  norms  and
standards. Thirdly, this amendment removes the implication  of  the  current
formulation that the only instance when the stopping of funds is allowed  is
when  a  serious  or  persistent  material  breach  of  Treasury  norms  and
standards is committed.

It accordingly makes it clear  that  the  national  Treasury  may  stop  the
transfer of conditional grants to provinces and municipalities  if  they  do
not comply with the conditions of the grant. Section 217(3)  is  amended  to
make it clear that to the extent that organs of state decide to implement  a
preferential procurement policy, such policy must be implemented within  the
framework set out in the Preferential Procurement  Policy  Framework  Act  -
the national legislation enacted pursuant to that section.

The amendment removes an anomaly caused by the pre-emptory requirement  that
national  legislation  must   prescribe   a   framework   for   preferential
procurement when, in terms of the current formulation, organs of state  have
the discretion to  simply  ignore  this  constitutionally  required  Act  of
Parliament.

We provided in section 220 of the Constitution for the establishment of  the
Financial  and  Fiscal  Commission,  or  FFC,  to  make  recommendations  to
Parliament, provincial legislatures and any other authority provided for  in
legislation.

While we provided that this important body would  make  recommendations  and
not decisions on  financial  and  fiscal  matters,  and  that  it  would  be
independent, impartial and subject only to the Constitution and the law,  we
structured it as if it were a financial and  fiscal  bargaining  forum  with
representatives of each province and of local government.

Besides the fact that the FFC's composition, in  terms  of  the  FFCs's  own
submission, is cumbersome and has resulted in many vacancies, it  also  goes
against the  fundamental  tenets  of  the  body  as  being  independent,  of
provinces as well, impartial, and subject to the Constitution and  the  law,
not to mandates given by the national  Government,  and  by  provincial  and
local government.

The amendment of section 221 will rectify this  anomaly  and  result  in  an
effective membership  of  only  nine  people.  Provision  is  made  for  the
enactment of national legislation to regulate the participation of  premiers
and organised local governments in the appointment  of  FFC  members.  There
is, of course, a  consequential  amendment  to  section  163  to  deal  with
organised local government participation in the FFC process.

Section 226 is amended to allow for the enactment of  framework  legislation
to ensure proper and uniform budgetary processes in the  provinces,  and  to
ensure that direct charges against provincial revenue funds are  treated  by
all provinces as  an  exceptional  form  of  authorising  expenditure.  This
amendment effectively ensures that  the  budget  process  is  comprehensive,
coherent and transparent.

The amendment of section 226 also ensures that the  allocation  of  national
Government funds to local government through  a  province  must  be  divided
among  municipalities  in  the  province   in   accordance   with   national
Government's criteria.

A  technical  amendment  is  affected  to  section  228(1)(b)  to  delete  a
reference to the words ``tax bases''  as  tax  experts  believe  that  these
words have no definite meaning in the context in  which  they  appear.  This
deletion enhances the provinces' power to raise taxes,  including  flat-rate
surcharges on certain national taxes.

Section  230  is  amended  to  ensure  that  it  only  regulates  provincial
borrowing powers, as municipal borrowing powers will now be  dealt  with  in
the new section 230A referred to earlier.
The amendment to section 230, as is the case with section 230A,  also  makes
it clear that loans  for  current  expenditure  may  only  be  raised  where
necessary for bridging  purposes,  and  accordingly  deletes  the  confusing
requirement that bridging finance be repaid within 12 months.

These   constitutional   amendments   improve   financial   governance   and
transparency, make provision  for  the  enactment  of  the  legal  framework
necessary to ensure cheaper  local  government  borrowing,  covering  longer
periods, which  is  essential  for  local  infrastructure  development,  and
clarify confusions and sometimes contradictory sections  in  Chapter  13  of
the Constitution.  It  is  technical,  but  it  is  very  clearly  set  out.
[Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I prepared  a  12-page  speech,  but  after
listening to the Deputy Minister I have no choice but to leave out 10  pages
and concentrate on only two pages. [Interjections.]

When dedicated people are at work,  they  alter  things  which  need  to  be
altered, improve things which need to be improved  and  accommodate  genuine
concerns raised by people who might  be  negatively  affected.  As  seasoned
politicians, we are doing the same in this Bill.

In the past few years our Constitution has been put under a  spotlight,  and
it was apparent that it is  not  without  shortcomings.  These  shortcomings
came from a range of practical difficulties that  were  encountered  in  its
implementation, especially the clauses dealing with financial matters.

The powers of the Minister of Finance are extended in this Bill by  amending
section 73(2). In terms of this section, only a Cabinet member or  committee
of the National Assembly may  introduce  draft  legislation,  but  only  the
Cabinet member responsible for national  finance  matters  may  introduce  a
money Bill in the Assembly. In other words, only  the  Minister  of  Finance
may introduce all legislation emanating from the provisions  of  Chapter  12
of the Constitution. This then means  that  only  the  Minister  of  Finance
would  be  constitutionally  competent  to  introduce  money  Bills  in  the
Assembly.

The Minister of Finance will do all these things mentioned  in  Chapter  12,
except when such legislation relates  to  the  financial  administration  of
Parliament or a provincial legislature, or deals with  the  remuneration  of
persons holding public profits mentioned in section 219, or regulates  rates
on property in terms of section 229.

In this Bill we have been careful not to do anything  that  will  negatively
affect provinces. The NCOP, as a link between the  national  Government  and
the provinces, will have a say on any  financial  legislation  that  affects
provinces from now on. As I said, the hon the Deputy  Minister  has  covered
lot of ground. I think the best thing for me to say now is that in  whatever
one is doing, if one realises or  discovers  that  one  is  facing  a  wrong
direction, one should  just  turn  around  and  face  the  right  direction.
[Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The Chair is not making a mistake;  Mr
Lever.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I did not suggest that you were.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Nor did I suggest that Mr Lever  was;  I  was
replying to somebody. Carry on, Mr Lever.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I hope this has not eaten into my time; not  that
I need much, because the Bill has  been  explained  rather  comprehensively,
but I will try to give a précis of it.

The Bill  contains  a  number  of  important  technical  amendments  to  the
Constitution of the Republic. The amendment  of  section  73  provides  that
only the Minister of Finance may introduce a  Bill  that  provides  for  the
equitable  division  of  revenue  raised  nationally  among  the   national,
provincial and local spheres of government. It also  provides  that  such  a
Bill may not be introduced in this House.

Section 77 is amended to replace and extend the definition of  money  Bills.
The word ``national'' is inserted  before  ``taxes''  to  distinguish  taxes
raised at national level from those envisaged in the amendments  to  section
120 of the Constitution. The effect of section 77, read with section 73,  is
that only the Minister of Finance may introduce a  Bill  which  establishes,
abolishes or reduces taxes, or authorises with certain limited exceptions  a
direct charge on the national revenue fund.

The amendments to section 120 brings the provincial equivalent  of  a  money
Bill into line with the changes made to the definition at national level.

The amendments to section 163(b) remove  the  obligation  on  Parliament  to
enact an Act  to  regulate  the  appointment  of  representatives  of  local
government to the Financial and Fiscal Commission. This procedure  will  now
be regulated by the procedures envisaged by the amendments  to  section  221
of the Constitution.

The amendments to section 216 clarify when and  in  what  circumstances  the
national Treasury may stop the transfer of funds to a province or  an  organ
of state.

The effect of the amendments to section 217 is to  provide  that  organs  of
state must procure goods and services in a fair, equitable, transparent  and
cost-effective manner, and that such organs of state  must  implement  their
preferential procurement policies  within  the  framework  set  out  in  the
relevant national legislation.

The contentious part of the Bill is contained in the amendments  to  section
221. Their effect is to reduce the number of members of  the  Financial  and
Fiscal Commission from 22 to 8 members.  Originally,  each  province  had  a
representative on the commission. In terms of the amendments, the  President
shall appoint three members to represent the provinces,  after  consultation
with the premiers of all the provinces.  Our  fear  is  that  an  opposition
voice will be excluded from the commission.

The Amendment to section 226  of  the  Constitution  provides  for  national
legislation which will set up a framework to determine when a  province  may
authorise a withdrawal of money as a direct charge  against  the  Provincial
Revenue Fund. It also provides  that  money  allocated  to  a  province  for
municipalities  in  such  province  be   paid   over   to   the   respective
municipalities.

The amendments to section 228 are merely for deleting the  words  ``the  tax
bases of'', as in the context of  section  228  they  had  no  meaning.  The
amendments to section 230 of the Constitution make  the  provisions  thereof
applicable to provinces only.  The  circumstances  in  which  municipalities
could commit themselves to debt were dealt with in  the  previous  amendment
to the Constitution. Despite the  one  reservation  set  out  here,  the  DP
supports the Bill.
Mr N  V  NGIDI  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson  this  Government  has  always
recognised the  involvement  of  provinces  in  the  national  processes  of
governance. The creation of the NCOP attests to that. We  thereby  maximised
the role of provinces in the national legislative  process.  This  not  only
helped the provinces to impact on national processes, but also ensured  that
national processes became as transparent as possible. We as provinces  would
like to jealously guard our continued role in national processes.

We as representatives from the KwaZulu-Natal  legislature  have  been  given
the mandate to support the Bill at hand, but that  support  is  conditional.
The condition is with regard to  the  changes  that  we  believe  should  be
effected in  clause  7  of  the  Bill.  We  cannot  agree  to  a  diminished
provincial  role  in  the  FFC  process,  hence  we  object  to   decreasing
provincial representation.

We  believe  that  decreasing  provincial  representation  will  stunt   the
commission's  performance  of  its  task  as  contained  in  section  220(1)
subsection 1 of the Constitution. We appreciate that the  commission  as  it
is currently composed is too big and cumbersome and that  there  is  a  need
for its reduction. But we believe that the reduction must not happen at  the
expense of provincial representation. It is for this reason that  we  agreed
with all the provisions of clause 7 of the Bill, except  in  so  far  as  it
purports to reduce provincial representation. Our mandate  is  to  agree  to
all provisions of the Bill, except  in  so  far  as  it  reduces  provincial
representation from nine to three.

There is one legal point that  needs  to  be  addressed,  and  that  is  the
question whether at this stage of the Bill we are in a  position  to  effect
any amendment. There is an opinion that says section 74 does not  allow  for
that, but we believe that it is possible to  do  so.  In  terms  of  section
74(6) of the Constitution, we need to table written statements.

The question is: What should  be  contained  in  the  written  comments?  We
believe ours is not just to say aye or nay to the Bill, but,  if  necessary,
to amend it. We submit that section 74(b) of the Constitution gives us  that
authority. As such, we propose that clause 7 of the Bill be amended in  this
manner, and that is that it stands as it is except in clause  7(1)(b)  where
we  believe  the  status  quo,  as  provided  in  section  221(b)   of   the
Constitution, should prevail.

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, dit is nogal interessant dat die agb lid  Lever
hom verwerdig het om oor die Grondwet te praat terwyl  sy  party  vandag  sy
rug  op  die  Grondwet  gekeer  het.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, it is quite interesting that  the  hon  member
Lever deigned to speak about the Constitution while his party  today  turned
its back on the Constitution.]

His party undermined the Constitution of South Africa today by  walking  out
of Parliament. [Interjections.] The Constitution provides for  a  democratic
government. It provides for participation of political parties. It  provides
for houses of parliament, a public protector, courts, a  judiciary,  a  Bill
of rights and freedom of  speech.  What  does  Mr  Lever's  party  do?  They
boycott  the  highest  institution  of  democratic  government,   which   is
Parliament. [Applause.] [Interjections.] What is more ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! What is out of order, Mr Lever?

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the sitting which the DP walked out of was not  a
sitting   of   Parliament,   but   an   informal   gathering   of   members.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Ackermann, you may proceed.

Mr C ACKERMANN: What is more, they cannot take criticism. This  is  a  party
that has criticised Cosatu time and time again for boycotting. But  what  do
they do? They boycott! [Laughter.]

This is not ``fight back'';  it  is  ``back  fight''.  It  is  ``back-side''
politics. This is turning our  back  on  the  very  voters  who  put  us  in
Parliament to preserve the Constitution of  South  Africa.  [Interjections.]
They are not the DP. They  are  the  Boycott  Party  of  SA.  Therefore  the
question is: Does South Africa still need such a party? The  answer  is  no,
we do not need them. We need a constructive opposition in South Africa,  and
that party is the New NP of SA. [Applause]. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, we have not  heard  the  hon  Ackermann  say  one
relevant word about the Bill before this House. I would like to ask that  he
be confined to the subject matter of this debate.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Mr Lever, the hon member is  still  on
the floor.  You  may  proceed,  hon  member.  You  were  talking  about  the
Constitution.

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, ek sal die Huis  nie  langer  vermaak  met  dié
party nie. Ek het simpatie met die standpunt wat hy ingeneem het, maar Suid-
Afrika het dié party nie meer nodig nie.

Die Nuwe NP sal die Grondwet van Suid-Afrika  en  dít  waarvoor  dit  staan,
verdedig. Ons glo nie die Grondwet moet  willens  en  wetens  verander  word
nie, maar ons glo ook ons moet nie rigied wees as die Grondwet verbeter  kan
word nie. Daarom sal ons dié Wysigingswetsontwerp steun.

Ons het  sekere  voorbehoude  oor  klousule  7,  die  samestelling  van  die
Finansiële en Fiskale Kommissie. Tydens onlangse verhore van  Salga  in  die
portefeuljekomitee het ons verneem daar het 'n  behoefte  ontstaan  met  die
samestelling van die nuwe plaaslike owerhede in Suid-Afrika. Op plekke  waar
die drie vlakke van regering in die plaaslike  owerheid  verteenwoordig  is,
soos  die  metropole,  distriksmunisipaliteite  en  gewone  munisipaliteite,
verteenwoordig provinsiale plaaslike organisasie nie altyd  al  drie  vlakke
van regering nie. Dit laat die gewig in provinsiale organisasies  swaai  ten
gunste van òf metropole, distriksmunisipaliteite òf gewone munisipaliteite.

Die wetswysiging maak voorsiening vir net twee lede van plaaslike  owerhede.
Miskien moet ons dié aspek hersien om te kyk of ons  nie  'n  balans  tussen
die drie sfere van plaaslike owerhede kan kry nie.  Die  klem  moet  nie  op
metropole  of  distriksmunisipaliteite  geplaas  word  en   hulle   sodoende
voorkeur geniet nie. Ingevolge die  reëls  van  die  Finansiële  en  Fiskale
Kommissie moet ons ook na klein plaaslike owerhede kyk.

Ek wil dit graag onder die Minister se aandag bring. Dit is iets wat in  die
afgelope week  na  vore  gekom  het  en  wat  nie  ter  sprake  was  in  die
portefeuljekomitee nie. In die toekoms moet ons miskien daarna kyk.

Die vraagstuk wat in klousule 9  voorkom,  naamlik  ``tax  base'',  lei  tot
verwarring. Ons het vandag van die agb lid van die Vrystaat ook  gehoor  van
``tax base''. Daar bestaan ook  'n  siening  dat  die  streekdiensterade  se
heffings op 'n ``tax base'' gebaseer is, naamlik  omset.  Derhalwe  sal  ons
graag wil weet, wat was die regering se  oogmerk  deur  te  sê  dat  dit  'n
tegniese verwydering is uit die wet. Wat was die oorweging?  Hoekom  is  die
benaming ``tax base'' wel uit die wet gehaal?

Met hierdie paar woorde en met hierdie lekker ``DP-bashing''  sal  die  Nuwe
NP hierdie wetsontwerp  ondersteun.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, I shall no longer  entertain  the  House  with
this party. I have sympathy  with  the  standpoint  he  adopted,  but  South
Africa no longer needs this party.

The New NP will defend the Constitution of South Africa and what  it  stands
for. We believe that the Constitution should not be  amended  wilfully,  but
we also believe that we should not be rigid if  the  Constitution  could  be
improved. For this reason we shall support this amending Bill.
We have  certain  reservations  about  clause  7,  the  composition  of  the
Financial and Fiscal Commission. During the recent hearings of Salga in  the
portfolio committee we leant that a need  had  arisen  with  regard  to  the
composition of the new local authorities in South Africa.  In  places  where
the three tiers of government are represented in the  local  authority,  for
example   the   metropolises,   district   municipalities    and    ordinary
municipalities, provincial local organisations do not always  represent  the
three tiers of government spheres. This shifts  the  balance  in  provincial
organisations  in  favour  of  benefit  of  either  metropolises,   district
municipalities or ordinary municipalities.

The statutory amendment provides for only two members of local  authorities.
Perhaps we should revise this  aspect  to  see  whether  we  cannot  find  a
balance between the three spheres of local authorities.  The  emphasis  must
not be placed on metropolises or district municipalities so that they  enjoy
precedence as a consequence. In terms of the  rules  of  the  Financial  and
Fiscal Commission we must also look at the small local authorities. This  is
something I  would  like  to  bring  to  the  Minister's  attention.  It  is
something which has arisen this past week and which was not  raised  in  the
portfolio committee. Maybe we should look at this in the future.

The  issue  which  arises  in  clause  9,  namely  ``tax  base'',  leads  to
confusion. Today we also heard the hon member from the  Free  State  mention
``tax base''. There is also a perception that the  levies  of  the  regional
services councils are based on a ``tax base'',  namely  turnover.  Therefore
we would like to know what the Government's intention  was  when  it  stated
that this was a technical exclusion from the Act. What was  the  motivation?
Why was the phrase ``tax base'' removed from the Act?

With these few words and with this enjoyable  DP-bashing  the  New  NP  will
support this Bill.] [Applause.]]

Prof M N KHUBISA (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson,  hon  members,  some  of  the
concerns of our province have been ably echoed by my colleague next  to  me.
This Bill seeks, among other things, to clarify  in  a  broader  manner  the
meaning of a money Bill. The Bill  includes  or  introduces  other  matters,
which are not found in the original text of the related clauses or  sections
in the Constitution, for instance in clause 2(a)  of  this  Bill  where  the
word ``or'' is deleted, and in clause  2(b)  where  ``or''  is  deleted  and
``duties or surcharges'' included.

This money Bill, again, in clause 2(c) goes on to include the  abolition  or
reduction, or granting of  exemptions  from,  any  national  taxes,  levies,
duties or surcharges. No one can deny the  fact  that  we  need  a  national
framework that embodies uniformity in  standards  and  norms  regarding  the
procurement procedures of funds by the organs of state.  This  is  necessary
and important if, as a country,  we  have  to  develop  means  and  ways  of
regulating how state organs use the finances of the state.

Let me say just two things, which are our concerns especially from  the  IFP
side. We feel that the Constitution should not  be  amended  piecemeal,  but
through a constitutional review process which is annual.  I  think  that  is
our concern. But let me hasten to  say  that  there  is  sense  in  removing
ambiguities and complexities from  any  law.  However,  as  the  hon  Deputy
Minister stated in her speech,  we  need  time  to  argue  matters  of  this
magnitude. Therefore, we need time to discuss  these  matters  because  they
are very important.

It is very important for the Government to  have  a  national  framework  to
ensure that organs of state are able to use  the  money  of  the  Government
according to the standards set, although I must say, there is some need  for
creativity in terms of which organs of state are  given  an  opportunity  to
work under their own set parameters and that the state  checks  whether  the
moneys are used correctly.

Having said that, let me hasten to say that as a province we  feel,  as  has
been said, that when we have the FCC, the number may be too big, because  we
have to deal with issues of efficiency and effectiveness.  We  propose  that
we remove the underlined words in clause 7(b) in order  that  the  provision
continues to read as it currently stands. [Applause.]

Mr S L ANDERSEN (Western Cape): Chairperson, initially the province  of  the
Western Cape expressed concern regarding the provisions of the  Bill  as  it
appeared at its first publication.  However,  since  its  first  publication
amendments have been made to the Bill. The province is pleased that most  of
the contentious clauses, to which  the  province  initially  objected,  have
indeed have been rejected by the parliamentary portfolio committee,  and  do
therefore not appear in the final draft of the  Bill  currently  before  the
Council.

In view thereof, the province wishes to express its support  for  the  Bill.
At the same time, while the province does support the Bill, it  also  wishes
to note certain  reservations  regarding  three  of  the  clauses.  Firstly,
regarding clause 4: proposed amendment of section 163, this clause  provides
that  an  Act  of  Parliament  must  determine  procedures  by  which  local
government may participate in the process envisaged in section 221 to  elect
its representative to the Financial and Fiscal Commission.

While we accept that the envisaged process which is being  provided  for  in
this clause and in the proposed amendment to  section  221  will  allow  for
participation, this amendment will mean  that  local  government  loses  the
right to nominate  persons  to  the  FFC.  There  is  a  difference  between
nomination and mere consultation.  In  practice  it  will  mean  that  local
government will only be consulted as to who their representatives are.  They
will  however,  not  be  able  to  have  the  final  say  as  to  who  their
representatives to the FFC are  as  they  would  have  had,  had  they  been
allowed to actually nominate persons.
Secondly, with regard to clause 7, the proposed amendment  of  section  221,
while this province realises that in terms of practicality there is  a  need
to reduce the  size  of  the  FFC  by  reducing  the  number  of  provincial
representatives to the FFC from  nine  to  two,  this  will  mean  that  the
provinces will only be collectively represented. It must be  borne  in  mind
that the economic  environment  and  financial  position  and  interests  of
provinces differ from one another, and that  each  province  should  ideally
have its own representative to address that province's particular needs  and
concerns.

Furthermore, the Constitutional Court, in ex  parte  of  the  Constitutional
Assembly, in recertification of the Constitution Republic  of  South  Africa
Act of 1996,  emphasised  the  importance  of  the  representation  of  each
province at the FFC. This was enshrined  in  the  constitutional  principles
upon which our Constitution is based, particularly constitutional  principle
27. Finally, while it is accepted that provinces and local  government  will
participate in the process being envisaged in the amendment of section  221,
provinces and local government will no longer be allowed to  nominate  their
representatives.
Thirdly, with regard to clause 9 - the proposed amendment to section  228  -
the proposed amendment of this section, will delete the words  ``tax  base''
from section 228. One cannot calculate a tax if there is no  tax  base  upon
which to calculate it.

Currently the Constitution will allow a provincial  legislature,  after  the
promulgation of the Provincial Tax  Regulation  Bill,  to  impose  flat-rate
surcharges on the tax bases of any nationally imposed tax levy duty.

In effect,  this  means  that  the  province  may  not  impose  a  flat-rate
surcharge as a percentage of national tax liability, ie  a  surcharge  or  a
tax on a tax. Thus, if the proposed amendment is effected,  it  would  imply
that a  province  may  impose  a  surcharge  on  a  national  tax  which  is
undesirable. Furthermore, by excluding the words ``tax base'', the  mobility
of provinces to impose provincial taxes and increase own revenue sources  is
severely restricted.

It is suggested that the words ``tax base'' should not be  deleted,  as  the
tax base is a higher income generator in comparison to tax potential on  tax
income, which is now proposed. The broader the tax base, the more  taxpayers
included in the base, and the greater the potential tax revenue for a  given
tax rate.

Finally, it should also be added that in the  new  proposed  Provincial  Tax
Regulation Process Bill mention is also made of a tax base. From  the  point
of view of consistency between statutes it may therefore  be  advisable  not
to delete the words from the Constitution. [Applause.]

Mr  T  B  TAABE:  Madam  Chair,  hon  Deputy  Minister   for   Justice   and
Constitutional  Development,  hon  members,  it  would   have   been   quite
interesting if we had the opportunity to  continue  the  debate  on  boycott
politics and boycott parties. We would probably have  had  a  very  exciting
afternoon of political engagement, at least at  the  level  of  this  House.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr T B TAABE: I will not dwell  on  such  issues.  I  think  our  overriding
responsibility is to support the amendments as proposed. Anything  else,  at
least at this juncture, is peripheral.
As I  have  pointed  out,  this  Bill  deals  with  a  number  of  technical
amendments which I would like to deal with  very  briefly.  Before  that,  I
think we as members of this House should take the opportunity to  thank  the
national Treasury for their resolve to ensure continuous review of  national
legislation on financial matters.

We should equally appreciate that such an exercise is bound  to  create  its
own complexities and difficulties in terms of legislation that  will  ensure
that we can comply with the dictates enshrined in our Constitution.

The Deputy Minister  this  afternoon  referred  to  the  legislative  review
undertaken by the national Treasury which emphasises the need  for,  in  her
own words, a comprehensive, transparent,  coherent  and  accountable  budget
process, which is sufficiently dealt with in sections  77  and  120  of  the
Constitution.

Equally important is section 217(3) which  makes  provision  for  organs  of
state who want to implement a preferential procurement policy. This  section
is quite unambiguous. It is quite unambivalent. It says quite  clearly  that
whatever organ of state implements a preferential  procurement  policy  must
do so within the framework set out in the  Preferential  Procurement  Policy
Framework Act.

Regarding this Bill, section 221 changes  the  composition  of  the  FFC  by
reducing the number of members from 22 to eight, thus obviating the  problem
of the FFC being a cumbersome body. We hope that with this provision, as  is
being suggested, a body as important as the FFC will be able to execute  its
mandate in a most effective and efficient way.

The technical amendments, as suggested, will assist us as  legislatures  and
other arms of Government to do the kind of work we are  supposed  to  do  in
terms of the Constitution, thus ensuring that, in  the  final  analysis,  we
can improve the lot of our people out there.

I would have loved to respond to the  statements  the  hon  members  of  the
opposition made. I will not, because I do not have time  this  afternoon  to
engage in all sorts of trivialities in this House. All sorts of things  were
said which to me were nothing but  errant  twaddle,  if  not  balderdash  at
worst. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam
Chair, we remain convinced that the new format  for  the  FFC  will  enhance
service to provinces. It is a principled position that we  have  taken.  One
of the issues that we have to deal with today is the rigid sticking  to  the
principle that provinces can only be represented if they have a  member.  We
feel this is not true.

We do not think each province requires its  own  member,  partially  because
many of the provinces experience very similar fiscal  challenges,  but  also
because we think the three people that will be nominated  to  represent  the
provinces would very much be able to champion the cause of  all  nine.  That
is certainly our feeling.

Mr Lever is worried about the possible  exclusion  of  an  opposition  voice
from the FFC. However, as section 221  currently  reads,  each  province  is
represented by one  person  nominated  by  the  executive  council  of  that
province. It is obviously unlikely  that  the  executive  council  concerned
would nominate an opposition representative.

In any event, the bottom line is still that the  FFC  must  be  independent.
Members of the FFC do not represent political principals. That is a  reality
of an independent body, and it is quite simple.

Mr Ackermann expressed concern about local government involvement.  It  went
beyond taking into account the provision  made  by  the  Bill  for  national
legislation that  will  provide  for  the  involvement  of  organised  local
government in the appointment of the FFC.

If that legislation comes up, the hon Mr Ackermann really needs to  play  an
active role in the formation thereof and get involved. Maybe he should  flag
that in his select committee's work. I wish him well on the way forward.

The reference to the words ``tax base'' in section 228 is  removed  because,
in our view and in the view of international experts, and in the context  in
which it exists, these words have no proper meaning. Where they do exist  in
other pieces of legislation, they probably  have  a  specific  meaning,  but
here they do not. We believe the removal of  those  words  further  enhances
the taxing  powers  of  provinces  as  they  will  now  be  able  to  impose
surcharges on the identified taxes and not just the tax bases that exist.
We are talking about viewpoints. Our viewpoint is that this  will  certainly
streamline the process. We do not  believe  that  there  is  a  Machiavelian
intent to wrest influence or power from provinces. They will  be  very  well
represented. Furthermore, if the FFC works better, as  the  FFC  itself  has
said, I remain convinced that the provinces will be  served  better  in  the
long run. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Before I give parties the  opportunity
for declarations of vote, I think it is necessary to point out to the  House
that  we  have  noted  the  amendment,  but  that  according  to  Rule  173,
amendments  have  to  be  placed  on  the  Order  Paper.  My  interpretation
therefore is that they cannot be moved from the floor.  I  just  wanted  the
House to know that I did not overlook that, but that I followed the Rules.

Declaration of vote:

Mr P A MATTHEE:  Chairperson,  our  mandate,  which  has  already  been  put
forward by both speakers from KwaZulu-Natal, is to propose an  amendment  to
clause 7 by removing the underlined words in paragraph (b) of  subsection  1
in order that the provision continues to read as it currently stands in  the
Constitution. Both speakers have referred to that. We  have  taken  note  of
what you have said regarding the amendment. Our position is,  however,  that
if this amendment cannot be considered today,  we  as  a  province  have  to
oppose the Bill as a whole. That is our mandate.

I would also like to bring to your attention, in  making  this  declaration,
as has been pointed out by the Western Cape delegate  in  his  speech,  that
although they have said they would  support  the  Bill,  they  have  serious
reservations as far as clause 7 is concerned.  In  actual  fact,  they  have
also referred to the certification judgment by the Constitutional  Court  in
which the representation of each province at the  FFC  was  emphasised,  and
which  is  enshrined  in  the  constitutional  principles  upon  which   our
Constitution is based.

The position is that this mandate is dated only 13  November.  Today  is  15
November. The letter sent to the province points out that there is  no  room
for a negotiating mandate, but that it will only be either a aye or  a  nay.
We really feel strongly about this as a province, and we submit to you  that
there might be a way in which this amendment can be  considered.  If  it  is
then rejected, that would be that, but if it cannot be considered, we  as  a
province have to object to the Bill and oppose the Bill as a whole.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, you have quite  correctly  drawn
the attention of my hon colleague to the procedure in the NCOP in  terms  of
its Rules. The specific rule - Rule  224  -  which  deals  with  section  74
legislation, that is legislation that deals with constitutional  amendments,
provides specifically that  before  amendments  can  be  considered  by  the
Council, they must be placed on the Order Paper. Furthermore, in  the  event
of a member placing an amendment on the Order Paper later  than  12  o'clock
on the preceding day, he or she can only do so with the  permission  of  the
Chairperson of the Council.

That is the provision. It  does  not  allow  any  latitude  other  than  the
latitude that should the member fail to do so prior to the  24-hour  period,
then he or she must seek the permission of the Chairperson of the Council.

It is my respectful submission that this is a peremptory provision.  We  are
talking about rules, and when we talk about the  Constitution,  we  have  to
show the discipline and respect for that particular Rule. Furthermore,  this
Bill was circulated  and  provinces  have  participated  in  the  processes.
KwaZulu-Natal  was  part  and   parcel   of   the   delegation   that   made
representations when the committees conferred jointly, and they  were  aware
of the fact that this matter was being referred directly to the Council.

Given that knowledge, there was sufficient opportunity for  the  member,  or
for the province, to make the appropriate application for  an  amendment  to
be placed on the Order Paper, and then considered. The  practicality  of  it
is that  we  cannot  expect  members  or  provinces  to  deviate  from  this
procedure, because we are  dealing  with  a  constitutional  amending  Bill.
Otherwise, provinces would  now  have  to  consider  the  amendment  without
having a mandate from their provinces to do so. This is the  same  prejudice
that is being pleaded by KwaZulu-Natal through its representative.

I find it quite extraordinary that Mr Matthee raises the  point  when  there
are special delegates present, who  are  the  duly  authorised  persons  who
carry the mandate  of  the  province.  However,  they  are  not  making  the
application. But Mr Matthee, who is a permanent delegate,  is  putting  that
position forward. I do not know whether such a mandate was conferred on  him
to move such an amendment in this House.

In a nutshell, unless an amendment appears on the Order Paper, it cannot  be
considered by Council, because each and every member of the Council must  be
fully aware of the exact contents of that proposed amendment.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, now the  ball  is  in  my
court as I am the Chair. My ruling is that the  Rules  of  this  House  will
prevail. Therefore we will proceed with the programme.

Bill agreed to in accordance  with  section  74(3)(b)  of  the  Constitution
(KwaZulu-Natal dissenting).

                  CRIMINAL PROCEDURE SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam
Chair, this Bill is self-explanatory, very easy and very uncomplicated,  and
it is way overdue. I just want to say  that  it  will  bring  to  our  court
management processes an enormous boon. It will have  a  positive  impact  on
court role management and court management. I do believe that that is to  be
welcomed by all.

I also know that in the committee process  there  was  general  support  for
this process, because it does not have a downside.

I am urging the Council to support the Bill. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L  MOKOENA:  Chairperson,  let  me  follow  the  Deputy  Minister's
example, because yesterday we went through a very difficult time.

In short, the select committee looked at this Bill and agreed that  we  were
going to support it, because it makes it possible for the accused  to  enter
into some kind of agreement with the prosecutor to expedite the case  if  he
or she is pleading guilty. So, we are simply formalising  that  process,  as
the Deputy Minister said.

Having said that, I support the Bill. [Applause.]
Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, the New NP supports this Bill which  introduces
a comprehensive new provision to give certainty to the system  of  plea  and
sentencing bargaining. It is a detailed and excellent piece  of  work  which
ensures that the rights of both the victims of crime  and  the  accused  are
not overlooked where such a plea bargain arrangement or  sentence  agreement
is made an order of court.

We also have to make use of this opportunity to thank the South African  Law
Commission for the excellent work that it has done in  this  fourth  interim
report on the simplification of criminal procedure as far as,  specifically,
sentence agreement is concerned.

It also refers in this report to the benefits that this  will  have  on  our
whole criminal justice system.  As we all know, and we have discussed it  in
this Council before and referred to it, there is a serious  problem  in  the
criminal justice system as far as the backlog in the  courts  is  concerned,
and as far as awaiting-trial prisoners in  our  prisons  are  concerned.  We
know that  there  are  even  some  of  those  awaiting-trial  prisoners  who
actually want to plead guilty. Some of those to whom we  have  spoken  could
plea guilty. This new amending Bill will certainly enhance  the  process  of
getting rid of the unacceptable backlog in our criminal justice system.

We want to express the hope and we trust that the goals that  are  set  with
this Bill will be met and that this will be used extensively and  also  that
legal practitioners will make use of this  Bill.  We  hope  that  this  will
enhance the whole criminal justice system in our country. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, in order  to  streamline  the  procedure  in  the
criminal courts, the South African Law Commission investigated the  question
of plea bargaining and sentence bargaining. The Law  Commission  found  that
although it was an informal process, the practice  of  plea  bargaining  has
been conducted in our courts for some time, and that  these  practices  were
considered legal. In the past there was, however, no sentence bargaining.

In order to provide an incentive to entering into a plea of guilty,  it  was
felt that the issue of sentence  bargaining  needed  to  be  introduced  and
strictly regulated. Only prosecutors who are authorised in  writing  by  the
National Director of Public Prosecutions may enter into  plea  and  sentence
agreements. It is hoped that in practice this means only senior  prosecutors
will be authorised to enter into plea and sentence agreement.

An additional safeguard in the Act is that only the accused who are  legally
represented may enter into plea and sentence agreements. This  is  necessary
to both obviate any form of coercion on  an  accused  to  plead  guilty  and
exclude this as a  ground  to  appealing  or  reviewing  any  conviction  or
sentence imposed as a result of a plea and sentence agreement.

In  terms  of  the  Bill,  a  prosecutor  will  have  to  consult  with  the
investigating officer  unless  this  would  cause  undue  prejudice  to  the
prosecution's case  or  would  affect  the  administration  of  justice.  In
entering into a plea and sentence agreement, the prosecutor  must  have  due
regard to the nature of and  circumstances  relating  to  the  offence,  the
personal circumstances of the  accused,  the  previous  convictions  of  the
accused, and the interests of the community. Where it is  reasonable  to  do
so,  the  prosecutor  must  allow  the  complainant  or  his  or  her  legal
representatives  to  make  representation  regarding  the  contents  of  the
agreement and the possibility of including, in the  agreement,  a  condition
relating to compensation or rendering of some benefit or service in lieu  of
compensation to the complainant.

There are a number of formalities relating to the form and  content  of  the
agreement. A court is not  permitted  to  participate  in  the  negotiations
leading to an agreement. Once  an  agreement  has  been  entered  into,  the
prosecutor shall inform  the  court  of  that  fact.  The  court  will  then
ascertain whether the formalities have been complied with,  and  afford  the
prosecutor an opportunity to correct any defects if the agreement  does  not
comply with the necessary formalities. After the contents of  the  agreement
have been disclosed, the court  shall  question  the  accused  to  determine
whether the agreement was entered into freely and voluntarily and  that  the
facts admitted by the accused constitute the offence to which he or she  has
pleaded. Further, the court will ascertain whether the accused confirms  the
contents of the agreement.

If for any reason the court is not satisfied that the accused is  guilty  of
the offence pleaded to, it shall enter a plea of ``not guilty''  and  unless
the accused waives this right, the trial shall proceed in  front  of  a  new
magistrate. If the court is satisfied that the  accused  is  guilty  of  the
offence pleaded to, it shall consider the sentence agreement. If  the  court
considers the sentence agreement just, it shall  convict  and  sentence  the
accused in accordance with the agreement.

If the court considers the sentence unjust, it shall inform  the  prosecutor
and the accused of what sentence it will consider just. The  prosecutor  and
the accused would then have a choice  to  either  abide  by  the  agreement,
subject to the right to lead evidence and present arguments on sentence,  or
withdraw from the agreement.

If under these circumstances the prosecutor and the accused choose to  abide
by the agreement, it may impose a  sentence  which  it  considers  just.  If
either party withdraws from the agreement, then  the  trial  shall  commence
afresh in front of a different magistrate, unless the  accused  waives  this
right.

This  piece  of  legislation  is  necessary  in  order  to  streamline   the
procedures of the criminal justice system and, as such, the DP supports  it.
[Applause.]

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, I will not take much of the  hon  members's  time
this afternoon. In relation to what has been said already by the hon  Deputy
Minister and other members, I want to say few  things.  One  of  the  issues
that I felt needed to be mentioned is that the Criminal Procedure  Act,  Act
51 of 1997, did not and  does  not,  in  any  way,  regulate  the  issue  of
sentence bargaining agreements, and this Bill, as  hon  members  know,  does
just that. I felt that it would be important to explain what  basically  are
the advantages of this legislation to our people in courtroom situations.

One of the advantages is that  the  proper  ends  of  the  criminal  justice
system are furthered, because swift and certain punishment  serves  the  end
of  both  general  deterrent  and  the  rehabilitation  of  the   individual
defendant. This  is  extremely  important.  A  plea  of  guilty  avoids  the
necessity of a public trial and may protect the innocent victim of  a  crime
against the trauma of having to give evidence.

Hon members probably recall what the situation has been in  our  communities
over the past few weeks in terms  of  the  heinous  crimes  that  have  been
perpetrated against innocent citizens of the country  out  there.  So,  this
would then facilitate  a  situation  in  which  the  innocent  victim  of  a
particular crime is able to deal with the trauma of having to give  evidence
before a court of law.

Lastly, I must say that a plea agreement again may also  contribute  to  the
prosecution of other more  serious  offenders.  The  glorious  army  of  the
African people of this country, the ANC, supports  the  amendments  to  this
Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson, I would like to thank  the  members  for  their  contributions,
which were positive, I might add. I also want to thank  the  officials  and,
in particular, Mr Labuschagne in our department, and  the  select  committee
for steering this legislation through this House. I would also like to  make
a rather unorthodox move with regard to the previous legislation.  I  forgot
to do that earlier, because I had so many pieces of paper.

I would like to put it on record that I am grateful to  the  Chair  and  the
select  committee,  and  also  to  the  members,  for  their  contributions.
Regarding that law it was very interesting, because we  obviously  had  huge
financial and a lot of legal inputs. This was an excellent  example  of  co-
operative governance. My thanks must go to Vuyo Kaagle of the Department  of
Finance and, of course, our own very valued  Mr  Johan  de  Lange  from  the
Department of Justice. Thanks to all the members for their inputs, and I  am
delighted that this Bill is going through.

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 17:12.

     on Designation of Ireland, dated 14 November 2001:


         The  Select  Committee  on  Security  and  Constitutional  Affairs,
         having considered the request for approval  by  Parliament  of  the
         Designation of Ireland in terms of the Extradition Act,  1962  (Act
         No. 67 of 1962), referred to it, recommends that  the  Council,  in
         terms of section 2(3)(a) of the Act, approve the said  designation,
         subject to the following conditions:


         1. No person surrendered by  Ireland  shall,  in  the  Republic  of
              South Africa -


              (a) be proceeded against, sentenced or detained with a view to
                  the carrying out of a  sentence  or  detention  order,  or
                  otherwise restricted in his or her personal  freedom,  for
                  any offence committed prior to his or her surrender  other
                  than  the  offence  in  respect  of  which  his   or   her
                  extradition was sought or an offence of which  he  or  she
                  may lawfully be convicted on a charge of  the  offence  in
                  respect of which extradition was sought, except -


                  (i)  with the consent of Ireland; or


                  (ii) where  the  person,  having  had  an  opportunity  of
                        leaving the Republic of South Africa, has  not  done
                        so within 45 days of final discharge in  respect  of
                        the offence for which the person was surrendered  by
                        Ireland or, having left the Republic of South Africa
                        after being so  surrendered,  has  returned  to  the
                        Republic of South Africa;

                  that offence, except so far as the offence under  the  new
                  description is shown by its constituent elements to be  an
                  offence which would allow extradition from Ireland.


         2. A person surrendered by Ireland shall not be surrendered by  the
              Republic of South Africa to another  country  for  an  offence
              committed before the surrender of the person by Ireland except

         considered the application by the National  Agricultural  Marketing
         Council for the implementation of proposed  statutory  measures  in
