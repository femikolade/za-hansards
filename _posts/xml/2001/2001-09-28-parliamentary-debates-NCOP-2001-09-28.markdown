              LAUNCH OF INANDA HERITAGE ROUTE IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -
       (a)  the launch of the Inanda Heritage Route  in  KwaZulu-Natal  last
           weekend, incorporating buildings historically linked to  Mahatma
           Gandhi, Dr John Dube, the first president of the  ANC,  and  the
           Ebuhleni Shembe Church; and


       (b)  that another important strand to KwaZulu-Natal's attributes as a
           tourism destination is added thereby;


  (2) acknowledges the great historical impact of Gandhi, who bequeathed to
       the world a uniquely effective philosophy of  satyagraha  or  passive
       resistance to racism and injustice;


  (3) accords due respect to the contribution of Dr Dube, a  visionary  who
       inspired the upliftment of an oppressed people, founding a vernacular
       newspaper and an educational institution, both of which  still  exist
       today;


  (4) appreciates the challenge  to  eurocentric  notions  of  Christianity
       posed in the Shembe Church;


  (5)  therefore  wishes  to  underline  the  importance  of  cultural  and
       historical tourism which provides elements of fascination to tourists
       in such records, relics and places; and


  (6) welcomes this new dimension to heritage  sites  in  the  Republic  of
       South Africa as a whole.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

           SOUTH AFRICAN PARLIAMENT'S ROLE AS A TOURIST ATTRACTION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mev die Voorsitter, ek stel voor sonder kennisgewing:


  Dat die Raad -
  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat parlemente regoor die wêreld groot  toerisme-
       aantrekkingskragte is, hetsy vir buitelandse of binnelandse toeriste;


  (2) in die lig van bogenoemde  sy  kommer  uitspreek  oor  die  toerisme-
       onvriendelikheid van die Suid-Afrikaanse parlementêre kompleks;


  (3)   aanbevelings   vir   die   opgradering   van   die    geboue,    'n
       besoekersontvangslokaal  en  die  vertoon  van  artefakte   wat   die
       geskiedenis van die Parlement uitbeeld, steun;


  (4) verder aanbeveel dat daar nie gedraal moet word met die opdrag vir 'n
       beeld van oud-president Mandela nie en dat ondersoek ingestel word na
       die daarstel van skilderye, onder andere van die  eerste  Kabinet  en
       die voorsittende beamptes van die eerste demokratiese  Parlement  van
       Suid-Afrika; en


  (5) glo Suid-Afrika verdien 'n  parlement  wat  'n  positiewe  beeld  vir
       besoekers uitstraal.
Ek  stel  hierdie  mosie  ook  in  die  lig  van  Wêreldtoerismedag  gister.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes  that  parliaments  throughout  the  world  are  great  tourist
       attractions, whether for foreign or local tourists;


  (2) in the light of the above-mentioned, expresses  its  concern  at  the
       tourism-unfriendliness of the South African parliamentary complex;


  (3) supports  recommendations  for  the  upgrading  of  the  premises,  a
       visitors' reception hall and the exhibition  of  artefacts  depicting
       the history of Parliament;


  (4) further recommends that there be no  further  delay  as  regards  the
       commissioning of a statue of former president Mandela,  and  that  an
       inquiry be conducted into  the  production  of  paintings  of,  among
       others, the  first  Cabinet  and  presiding  officers  of  the  first
       democratic Parliament of South Africa; and


  (5) believes that South Africa deserves a  parliament  which  radiates  a
       positive image to visitors.

I also move this motion in the light of yesterday's World Tourism Day.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to the motion?

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Yes, Chairperson.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! There is an objection. The  motion  will
therefore become notice of a motion.

          SHOOTING INCIDENT AT ZUG CANTON PARLIAMENT IN SWITZERLAND

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Voorsitter, ek stel voor sonder kennisgewing:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) sy uiterste skok en afgryse uitspreek met die gebeure gister in  Zug,
       Switserland, toe 14 persone tydens 'n sitting van die kantonparlement
       doodgeskiet is;


  (2) sy innige meegevoel betuig met die naasbestaandes en vriende van  die
       gestorwenes, en met hul Switserse kollegas  wat  hierdie  traumatiese
       ondervinding moet deurmaak in 'n demokratiese raadsaal wat geskep  is
       om die belange van almal in die betrokke gebied te dien; en


  (3) 'n dringende versoek rig tot die instansies wat vir die veiligheid en
       sekuriteit van ons eie parlementêre kompleks verantwoordelik is om 'n
       intensiewe ondersoek te doen na die status van  die  veiligheidsopset
       in die Nasionale Vergadering, die Nasionale Raad  van  Provinsies  en
       die kantoorakkommodasie van parlementslede ten einde 'n herhaling van
       die tragedie hier ter plaatse te voorkom.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its extreme shock and horror at yesterday's events in  Zug,
       Switzerland, in which 14 people were shot dead during  a  sitting  of
       the cantonal parliament;


  (2) expresses its heartfelt sympathy with the next of kin and friends  of
       the deceased and with its Swiss colleagues who  had  to  suffer  this
       traumatic experience in a democratic assembly  that  was  created  to
       serve the interests of all in the area concerned; and


  (3) makes an urgent appeal to those bodies responsible for the safety and
       security of our own parliamentary  complex  to  launch  an  extensive
       investigation into the status of the security set-up in the  National
       Assembly,  the  National  Council  of  Provinces   and   the   office
       accommodation of members of Parliament in  order  to  avoid  a  local
       recurrence of this tragedy.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        CULTURAL LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr D M KGWARE: Madam Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon colleagues, ladies  and
gentlemen, it is indeed an honour to be afforded this opportunity  again  to
confirm my Government's commitment to the process of  social  transformation
in our country.

It is rather significant that we have this particular  debate  in  the  week
that we are celebrating national Heritage  Day.  This  Heritage  Day  is  an
important part of what defines us as people and as a country,  the  starting
point of our march towards the better and humane future we  desire  for  all
our people. Unless we understand the  impact  of  this  heritage  ourselves,
none of us can correctly answer the question: Who and what am I?

Many among us believe that when we speak of our national heritage  we  speak
only of language, custom, culture and the  arts.  According  to  this  Bill,
national Heritage Day should focus on these areas in  all  their  diversity,
recognising the  reality  that  this  diversity  is  but  a  combination  of
different colours and materials bound together to form a  single  field.  It
is therefore expected that we should pass  this  day  celebrating  the  very
complexity of this cultural event. At the same time, some  of  us  take  the
opportunity to celebrate particular moments in our history that  define  who
and what we are.

It is against this background that our  vision  is  born  to  transform  the
cultural, linguistic, archival and heritage landscape  of  this  country  in
such a way that the associated institutions reflect the ideals  of  our  new
democracy, a vision that says, while museums and  other  arts,  culture  and
heritage institutions in the  past  have  served  the  interests  of  a  few
citizens of the country, they are now in a  position  to  serve  the  entire
South African population.

This poses a series of  challenges.  It  includes  the  development  of  new
audiences, the development  of  human  resources,  implementing  affirmative
action policy by grooming  new  managers  across  the  colour  spectrum  and
mounting  existing  economic  policies  that  are  friendly  to   indigenous
artefacts, indigenous knowledge systems, etc.

It is for this reason that the department has embarked on  a  transformative
programme that culminated in  the  merger  of  formerly  separated  museums.
Amendments contained in the Cultural Laws Amendment Bill  include  technical
references to the 1961 constitution, the Senate and the House  of  Assembly.
Thus any Verwoerdian collection in the Act therefore resides in the  museums
of the apartheid forces.

In addition, the Pan South African  Language  Board  is  amended  to  effect
consequential amendments to the section on the appointment of its board.  In
the Bill the National Archives of SA's  position  as  a  public  service  is
regulated and the National Archives Commission is transformed to create  new
national archives advisory councils.

In conclusion, it was indeed hard work  to  effect  the  amendments  to  the
Cultural Institution Act, the National Heritage Council  Act,  the  Heraldry
Act, the Pan South African Language Board  Act,  the  National  Archives  of
South Africa Act, the National Arts  Council  Act,  the  National  Film  and
Video Foundation Act and the South African Geographical Names  Council  Act.
However,  the  legacies  of  these  endeavours  are  bequeathed  to  a   new
nonracial, culturally informed generation.

We need to recognise that the DP and the New NP indicated in  the  committee
that they would not be voting in favour of this Bill  and  their  report  is
tabled, together with this Bill.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, the New NP objects  to  this  Bill  on  the
following grounds.  The  portfolio  and  the  select  committees  failed  to
include the principle that a member must vacate office if he  or  she  fails
to fulfil their duties in terms of the functions of the  council.  Secondly,
the committees failed to accept the principle that  councillors  should  not
be paid allowances or receive honoraria, but should only be  reimbursed  for
direct costs. Thirdly, the committees  refused  to  accept  that  a  council
should appoint its own chairperson.

However, we are in agreement with many of  the  amendments,  especially  the
tightening up of the process to appoint members of  PanSALB,  which  enables
the Minister to appoint the  board  through  a  shortened  process,  and  to
appoint fewer councillors, which will financially benefit PanSALB and  allow
them to spend more money on the duties they are  there  for,  than  on  mere
costs of councillors.

But the question  still  remains:  When  will  the  rest  of  the  board  be
appointed? Now that the Minister is able to  appoint  only  four  additional
members, it might just be quicker. I hope that the Minister  has  an  answer
for us regarding that.

The inclusion of the NCOP's select committee  in  various  deliberations  on
these amendments is the route that many other departments should also  take,
for this is an equal House of Parliament. In fact, it is  the  higher  House
of Parliament. Departments and Ministers should  realise  this  and  we,  as
members, should conduct ourselves accordingly.

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, the DP also cannot accept or support the  Cultural
Laws Second Amendment Bill,  because  whilst  a  number  of  amendments  are
perfectly reasonable ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP:  Order!  Mr  Raju,  we  are  considering  the
Cultural Laws Amendment Bill, not the Cultural Laws Second  Amendment  Bill.
The subject is the Cultural Laws Amendment Bill. [Laughter.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75  of  the  Constitution  (New  National   Party   and   Democratic   Party
dissenting).

                     CULTURAL LAWS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

               (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon.)

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson  and  hon
members of  the  NCOP,  I  am  now  introducing  the  Cultural  Laws  Second
Amendment Bill, which is the section 76 Bill.

The introduction of this Bill is an attempt  by  my  department  to  further
regulate the amalgamation of cultural institutions. The Bill seeks  to  give
the Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and  Technology  similar  powers,  in
respect of the members of councils established  by  or  under  the  Cultural
Institutions Act of 1998 and the National Heritage Council Act of  1999,  to
determine criteria for  the  allowances  payable  to  and  reimbursement  of
expenses incurred by such members.

The other amendments proposed to the Cultural Institutions Act of  1998  are
to empower the Minister to declare  that  a  cultural  institution  must  be
amalgamated within a flagship institution and to  exempt,  subject  to  very
strict controls and conditions, a declared institution from the  prohibition
of selling  any  specimen  collection  or  other  movable  property  without
ministerial approval.

Issues surrounding the  financial  management  and  governance  of  cultural
institutions associated with my department have focused a  lot  of  interest
in the public area. Much of  this  interest  has,  unfortunately,  not  been
positive. Members will recall the difficulties my department has had in  the
area of performing arts institutions with regard to mismanagement  of  state
financial resources. In all instances, I had to intervene in one way or  the
other.

It  is  against,  mainly,  this  background  that  my  department  found  it
necessary  to  take  a  new  look  at  the  legislation  that  governs   our
relationship with all our cultural institutions. We found that  despite  the
fact that the Government funds associated institutions, almost at  100%,  it
had absolutely no  say  in  how  the  state's  resources  were  managed.  My
department had no legal tool to intervene in instances of even  prima  facie
instances of mismanagement of the state's resources.

The creation of flagship institutions is very important if we  are  to  have
effective utilisation of  scarce  resources.  This  is  an  opportunity  for
cultural institutions to share skills,  finances  and  other  resources.  It
will now be possible for us to protect the  heritage  of  the  country  from
looting and from the illegal trafficking of our heritage. It  will  also  be
possible to  use  international  best  practice  in  the  area  of  heritage
management and conservation.

Through flagships, cultural institutions  will  have  business  plans,  will
produce annual reports and have clear programmes  of  transformation  within
themselves. The department will be able to measure areas  of  blockages  and
see if practices in the institutions are aligned with the overall policy  of
the Government.

The powers of the Minister to appoint the  chairpersons  of  boards  are  in
line with the Public Finance Management Act. This measure is  essential  for
purposes  of  accountability  and   consistency.   This   legislation   puts
responsibility upon the Government to put in place measures to  ensure  that
public finances are managed correctly. The appointment  of  chairpersons  by
the Minister is a vital tool to ensure that the Minister has tangible  means
to ensure effective use of state assets.

A clause has also been added requiring associated institutions to submit  an
annual business plan for the Minister's  approval.  This  is  essential,  so
that some input can be made by the Ministry in what  the  organisations  are
planning for the year and also to  promote  synergy  in  policy  and  budget
implementation of Government state-funded institutions.

This amendment is not aimed at  diminishing  or  increasing  the  powers  of
institutions, such as the SA Heritage Resources Agency. SAHRA's  rights  and
obligations are provided for in the Act. The state is bound by the  Act  and
I cannot act in contravention of it.

The Bill can also not change the provisions of  existing  legislation  where
the legislation already provides for measures protecting  the  same  object.
This may result in duplication of functions and unnecessary expenditure.

Declared cultural institutions are national institutions. The Minister  will
consult with the affected parties, including structures such  as  Minmec  on
the amalgamation of cultural  institutions  into  flagship  institutions.  I
urge hon members, therefore, to support this Bill [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  members,  since  1994  great
strides have been made to ensure that  cultural  institutions  are  in  line
with  the  Government's  vision  of  creating   efficient,   effective   and
economically viable citadels. This is exactly what the Cultural Laws  Second
Amendment Bill is designed for.

Museums have been and are listed as public entities, hence the  demand  that
they be  compelled  to  conform  to  the  scrutiny  of  the  Public  Finance
Management Act, as the Minister has already mentioned.  We  also  know  that
some individual museums are escaping the  scrutiny  of  the  Public  Finance
Management Act, hence  the  demand  for  tougher  and  higher  standards  of
financial reporting and internal auditing.
It is therefore  not  surprising  that  the  department  is  regarding  this
citadel as the bedrock of the demands  I  have  referred  to.  Citadels,  if
carefully planned,  will  ensure  that  there  is  a  culture  of  corporate
governance in this institution. This will present it  with  the  opportunity
to infuse their expertise and creativity in the promotion of  arts,  culture
and heritage. It will ensure that the institutions  are  in  a  position  to
utilise  their  assets,  human  resource  development,   marketing,   public
relations, management research, etc, to their full potential.

The advantage of these measures will be a saving on administrative costs  in
order to  spend  more  on  making  museums  more  accessible  to  previously
disadvantaged communities. It will also assist museums to  align  themselves
with other tourism strategies adopted by Government, thereby supporting  the
national efforts aimed at the creation  of  jobs.  Both  the  Cultural  Laws
Amendment Bill and the Cultural  Laws  Second  Amendment  Bill  ensure  that
these challenges are met. Because  these  institutions  are  entrusted  with
public funds, we had to ensure that they become fully accountable.

More than 85%  of  the  Arts  and  Culture  budget  is  transferred  to  our
associated institutions  to  develop  and  promote  arts,  culture  and  the
heritage of our country. Therefore, it becomes even more  critical  that  we
are able to account for and  exercise  control  over  the  usage  of  public
funds. It is through sound business principles  that  we  will  be  able  to
ensure that the judiciary duties and general financial  responsibilities  of
the institutions  are  aligned  with  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act.
Moreover,  these   Bills   provide   an   opportunity   between   associated
institutions  and  the  department  to  jointly  plan   and   evaluate   the
implementation of policy.

With this, we indicate very fully that the  committee  also  did  very  well
with a Bill that, once more, out of  the  nine  provinces,  eight  provinces
voted for, and only one, that is the Western Cape, voted against.

We support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, I  have  been
mandated by my province as somebody who has performed the briefings  of  the
standing committee to  represent  it  and  to  state  its  position  on  the
proposed legislation.

Cultural  issues  are  close  to  the  people's  hearts  and  are  therefore
sensitive. To legislate on them cannot be done without touching  the  hearts
of the people who are connected with them, especially if the management  and
control thereof were to change to a certain degree.

The purpose  of  the  Bill  before  the  House  is  to  amend  the  Cultural
Institutions Act of 1998 and the National Heritage Council Act of 1999.  The
amendment is  the  result  of  an  evaluation  process  of  the  legislation
administered by the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology.

The following significant amendments are made  to  the  two  above-mentioned
principal Acts. Firstly, according to clause 1, the Minister may, by  notice
in the Gazette, declare that a declared  institution  or  other  institution
must be amalgamated with other declared institutions to form a new  flagship
institution. Secondly,  according  to  clause  2,  the  Minister  may  in  a
particular case or in general exempt a declared institution from selling  or
alienating any specimen collection or other movable property.

The principal Act is amended to determine that the director  of  a  declared
institution serves by right of his or her position and has no voting  powers
- clause 3(a). The chief executive officer of a flagship institution  serves
by right of his or her position and has no voting powers - clause  3(b).  In
terms of clause 3(c)(b) the Minister, with the concurrence of  the  Minister
of Finance, must determine  criteria  for  the  payment  of  allowances  and
reimbursement of expenses incurred for services performed by  members  of  a
council.

As per clause 5, a member of the  council,  who  is  not  in  the  full-time
employ of the state, may be be  paid  allowances  and  reimbursed  for  such
expenses incurred for services performed by him or her,  and  the  Minister,
with the concurrence of the Minister of  Finance,  must  determine  criteria
for payment of the allowances and reimbursement of such expenses.

In other words, the thrust of this piece of legislation is  to  empower  the
Minister  to  enable  the  amalgamation   of   certain   declared   cultural
institutions with flagship institutions.  For  example,  some  museums  were
designated  flagship  institutions  by   the   department,   such   as   the
Bloemfontein-Kimberley flagship, the Nelson Mandela Museum  and  the  Robben
Island ferry terminal or museum project.

In conclusion, the proposed legislation was  considered  by  the  provincial
standing committee on 15 June 2001. The committee agreed to agree  with  the
spirit and essence of  the  Bill.  The  North  West  province,  accordingly,
supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Ms A ROSSOUW (Western Cape): Hon Chair, hon Minister  and  members,  despite
the fact that  we  are  considering  amendments  to  the  National  Heritage
Council Act of 1999, it may be noteworthy to  fellow  members  of  the  NCOP
that the original National Heritage Council Act has never  been  enacted  by
the hon national Minister.

It may be necessary to ask the Minister and his department why this  is  the
case. What is more,  some  18  months  ago  the  members  of  the  executive
committee responsible for culture in all the nine provinces  were  requested
by the hon the Minister to nominate two candidates, each  for  consideration
by himself, to  represent  the  nine  provinces  on  the  National  Heritage
Council.

Despite the willingness of individual South  Africans  to  avail  themselves
for this task, no further action  or  acknowledgement  seems  to  have  been
taken by either the Minister or his department in establishing the  proposed
National Heritage Council.

Members may be interested to know  the  objects  of  the  National  Heritage
Council. They are: to develop, promote and protect  the  national  heritage;
to co-ordinate heritage management; to protect,  preserve  and  promote  the
content and heritage which reside in orature; to integrate  living  heritage
with the functions and activities of the  Council  and  all  other  heritage
authorities and institutions at national, provincial  and  local  level;  to
promote and protect indigenous knowledge systems; and to  intensify  support
for the promotion of  the  history  and  culture  of  all  our  people  and,
particularly, to support research and publication on  enslavement  in  South
Africa.

Could the hon the Minister please indicate why the original Act has not  yet
been implemented and why it is already  necessary  to  amend  the  Act?  The
proposed amendments under consideration are the second set of amendments  to
the National Heritage Council Act of 1999.

The final mandate of the Western Cape legislature was debated  on  a  number
of occasions over the past couple of weeks.  Careful  consideration  of  the
proposed amendments and recent developments, however, made the Western  Cape
wary of these, and it is for that reason that the Western Cape mandate is  a
qualified one.

I would like to give  some  reasons  why.  The  hon  the  Minister  and  his
department have  over  the  past  couple  of  years  been  involved  in  the
development  of  flagship  institutions.  There  are  currently   two;   one
established here  in  Cape  Town,  known  as  Iziko  Museum  of  Cape  Town,
amalgamated a number of declared national cultural institutions, whilst  its
counterpart in Gauteng, known as  the  Northern  Flagship  Institution,  was
also formed by the coming together of  various  declared  national  cultural
institutions in Pretoria and Johannesburg.

But in the last couple of years the Minister and his department have  mooted
the idea of establishing further  national  flagship  institutions,  one  in
KwaZulu-Natal and another in a central part  of  the  country  spanning  the
Free State and the Northern Cape provinces. It  is  during  the  discussions
and negotiations thus far that some doubts and questions have arisen.

In the Free State and the Northern Cape provinces great  unhappiness  exists
regarding these proposals to  not  only  amalgamate  the  national  declared
cultural institutions such as a National Museum, the  Oorlogmuseum  vir  die
Boererepublieke, also known as the  Anglo-Boer  War  or  South  African  War
Museum in Bloemfontein, and the William Humphrey Art Gallery  in  Kimberley,
but to add to these also provincial affiliated museums such as the  McGregor
Museum in  Kimberley,  established  and  declared  in  terms  of  provincial
legislation more than eighty years ago.

In KwaZulu-Natal, a proposal was also tabled to create a  national  flagship
institution by amalgamating not  only  the  Natal  Museum,  the  Voortrekker
Museum,  the  art  gallery  in  Pietermaritzburg  and  the  newly  developed
national museum at Blood  River,  but  also  the  Durban  Museum  for  local
history and its related institutions, which was established  by  the  Durban
local authority many years ago.

The most recent proposal by the department  is  to  declare  the  performing
arts companies, that is, section 21 companies established in  terms  of  the
Companies Act, or as they are now referred to,  ``playhouses'', as  cultural
institutions.

Mrs R A NDZANGA: Chairperson, will the hon member take a question?

Ms A ROSSOUW (Western Cape): No. I am not prepared to take questions.

These will include the State Theatre in Pretoria, the Playhouse  Theatre  in
Durban, Sukovs in the Free State and Artscape in Cape Town.  One  need  only
refer to the definition of ``institution'' as set out in the Act  to  become
rather amused and speculative as to  the  grounds  that  the  Minister  will
consider in declaring these institutions as cultural institutions,  as  they
are  public  libraries,  museums,  zoological  gardens  or  other   cultural
institutions that he regards to be of kindred character. What is  more,  all
these  theatre  complexes  are  owned  and  maintained  by  the   respective
provincial governments. The playhouse companies are tasked to  manage  these
facilities.

Chairperson, it is with these and other recent developments in mind  that  I
must again point out that careful  consideration  should  be  given  to  the
proposal made by the  Western  Cape  to  the  standing  committee  when  the
proposed amendments to the Bill were considered  and  qualifying  its  final
mandate to support this Bill.

Our concern should be seen in the spirit  of  co-operative  governance.  All
three spheres of government must contribute to the  conservation,  promotion
and development of our collective heritage, but we must  carefully  consider
the legislative and other mechanisms  that  we  institute  to  fulfil  these
functions. The Western Cape is unfortunately not in the position to  support
the Bill. [Interjections.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, hon Minister Ngubane, hon  special  delegates  and
colleagues, on a personal note, I wish to state it is  always  nice  to  see
Minister Ngubane in our midst. I have always enjoyed a cordial  relationship
with the likeable  Minister  who  hails  from  my  province.  I  have  happy
memories of our association as former colleagues in the South African  Black
Alliance. Today I speak on behalf of the  DP  ...  [Laughter.]  The  DP,  of
course, is a component of another alliance, the DA, of  which  the  Minister
is aware.

The Cultural Laws Second Amendment Bill states, in its long title,  that  it
intends to amend the Cultural Institutions Act of 1998 in a number of  ways.
Some of these amendments are perfectly reasonable and welcomed by my  party.
There are certain amendments which the DP cannot accept or  support  in  the
wider interests of the South African public.

Section 5  of  Act  119  of  1998  deals  with  a  member  vacating  office.
Amendments envisaged to subsection (9) are good from  clauses  (a)  to  (f),
but clause (g) states that a member must vacate office if:


  ... on reasonable grounds, the majority of the council so recommends ...

Firstly, what do we mean by ``reasonable grounds''? Secondly,  what  if  the
majority of the council gang up or act in  concert  for  the  said  member's
removal, on extraneous or irrelevant reasons, just because  they  might  not
like his face or his or her new hairstyle?

Section 7 of the Cultural Institutions Act of 1998  is  amended  to  provide
for the Minister to appoint the chairperson of the council. We say that  the
council  members  themselves  should  be  able  to  elect  the  chairperson.
Ministers should not become patrons of office, nor should beneficiaries  who
become chairpersons or office bearers feel beholden  and  obligated  to  the
Minister responsible for their positions.

We feel that if a Minister has the power to make such an  appointment,  then
he compromises the integrity of the  person  appointed,  and  the  objective
execution of duties to be undertaken by such a  person  inevitably  suffers.
When council members or his or her peers appoint the  chairperson,  then  no
such stigma or aroma of  nepotism  or  favouritism  will  waft  through  the
corridors.

The DP is unhappy with these amendments and therefore withholds its  support
for the Bill.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I hope you do not see this  as  ganging  up
against the Minister from the DA's side. I want to  start  off  by  thanking
the department for many of the amendments they brought  to  us.  I  want  to
thank them for being prepared to assist us, although  they  did  not  always
get the opportunity to do exactly that.  I  want  to  switch  to  Afrikaans,
because I really want to get it off my chest, which is important.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL:  Moet  net  nie  baklei  nie.  [Just  do  not
fight.]

Mnr  A  E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Ek   wil   'n   bietjie   baklei,   want   hierdie
wysigingswetsontwerp het prosedureel nie goed verloop nie en dit  mag  nooit
weer herhaal word nie. Die  status,  die  rol  en  die  funksionaliteit  van
hierdie Huis is hier in gedrang.

'n Wetsontwerp is in wese 'n voorstel deur 'n departement van behoeftes  wat
die departement of Minister sien om hulle  werk  beter  te  doen.  Dit  moet
egter deur die verteenwoordigers van grondvlak af, van die provinsies af  in
hierdie  geval,  goedgekeur  word.  Dit  moet  vervolgens  aangepas  en  dan
goedgekeur word as dit moet.  Dit  is  hierdie  verteenwoordigers,  ons  wat
hierso sit, wat die besluit namens die provinsies of ons kiesers moet neem.

'n Departement kan aanbevelings maak of motiverings bied waarom  amendemente
aanvaar moet word of nie, maar 'n departement besluit nie namens ons nie.

Ek is egter  bevrees  dat  hierdie  wysigings  wat  verskillende  provinsies
voorgestel het, nie die oorweging en beredenering ontvang het wat  dit  moes
kry nie. Ons het bloot 'n dokument in 'n baie laat stadium  ontvang,  waarop
wysigings aangebring is en ander  wysigings  wat  beskryf  is  as  ``matters
raised''. Hierdie ``matters raised'' is drie wysigings van die  Wes-Kaap  en
vyf wysigings van Gauteng wat deur die agb Kgoali voorgestel is.

Hierdie wysigings het voorstelle van ons bevat. Die  lede  van  die  komitee
het nie  die  geleentheid  gekry  om  dit  weer  te  beredeneer  of  om  die
departement se motivering vir die nie-aanvaarding te hoor nie.  Ek  het  die
departement baie jammer gekry want hulle  het  ses  mense  van  Pretoria  af
gestuur wat gesit het en dit nie kon doen nie. Dit is onaanvaarbaar  en  mag
nie herhaal word nie. Noudat ek my plig gedoen het, kan ek  verder  gaan  en
aandui hoekom ons nie hierdie wetsontwerp kan  steun  nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: I just want to fight a little, because  this  amendment
Bill did not follow  procedure  and  this  should  never  be  repeated.  The
status, the role and the functionality of this House is being jeopardised.

A Bill is basically a  motion  by  a  department  of  the  needs  which  the
department or the Minister  perceives  to  enable  them  to  do  their  work
better. This should, however, be approved by the representatives  at  grass-
roots level, from the provinces in this instance. It should consequently  be
adapted and then approved if necessary. It is these representatives, we  who
are sitting here, who should take the decision on behalf  of  the  provinces
or the electorate.

A department can  make  recommendations  or  offer  motivations  as  to  why
amendments can be accepted or not, but a department does not decide  on  our
behalf. However, I am afraid that these amendments, which were  proposed  by
different  provinces,  did  not  receive  the  necessary  consideration  and
discussion they should have. We merely received a document at  a  very  late
stage on which amendments were effected  and  other  amendments  which  were
described as matters raised. These matters raised are three amendments  from
the Western Cape and five amendments from Gauteng  which  were  proposed  by
the hon Kgoali.

These amendments contained our proposals. The members of the committee  were
not  afforded  the  opportunity  to  discuss  it  again  or  to   hear   the
department's motivation for the non-acceptance. I felt very  sorry  for  the
department, because they sent six people from Pretoria  who  sat  and  could
not do the job. This is unacceptable and should not be repeated. Now that  I
have done my duty, I can continue and indicate why we  cannot  support  this
Bill.]

I am now talking on Ms Kgoali's behalf, but I see that  she  is  engaged  in
another meeting.

Clause 1(a) states that the Minister may, by mere  notice  in  the  Gazette,
declare that a  declared  institution  or  any  other  institution  must  be
amalgamated with the flagship, or as in clause  1(b),  be  amalgamated  with
other declared institutions to form a new flagship. This  clause  interferes
with the powers of provincial and local government. This clause ignores  the
principles of co-operative governance which we debated at  length  yesterday
with the Deputy President.

Consultation  and  agreement  with  the  provincial  MECs,  the   provincial
committees responsible for  culture  or  the  local  authority  are  totally
ignored and the power vests in the Minister alone. The question  is  whether
this is in line with our Constitution.

We feel very strongly, with the Gauteng province, the Western Cape and I  am
sure other provinces as well, about clause 7, as mentioned by  my  colleague
over there. This amendment gives the  Minister  the  power  to  appoint  the
chairperson of a council which he appointed ... [Interjections.]

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, on a point of order ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon member Kgoali, I did  not  recognise
you. You should indicate to me when you want to raise a point of order.  Let
us hear what you want to say.

Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, I am of the opinion that the hon member  is  out
of order. If Gauteng wants to state its case it will do so.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson,  I  hope  that  this  remark  will  not  be
deducted from my allocated time.

We suggested that the council members  should  appoint  the  chair  for  the
Minister. The Minister appoints the council  and,  surely,  he  should  have
confidence in his council at least to elect their chairperson.

As a matter of fact,  the  national  museum  in  Bloemfontein,  the  William
Humphreys  art  gallery  in  Kimberley,  the  Natal  museum,  the  Afrikaans
language museum, the  Council  for  Jewish  Science,  the  National  English
Literary museum, the SA Cultural History  Museum,  the  Iziko  museums,  the
Voortrekker  Museum  and  the  Pietermaritzburg  Natal  Arts   Council   all
suggested, in their submissions to the department, that the  council  should
be allowed to appoint their own  chairs.  But  the  department  ignored  all
these provinces, political parties and relevant institutions. I really  want
to know the reason.

Members of the department never got an opportunity to explain this.  I  hope
the Minister will do so. We really cannot support this.

Mr K PANDAY (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon  Minister  of  Arts,  Culture,
Science and Technology, Dr Ben Ngubane and hon members, when amendments  are
made to ensure that a department operates smoothly  for  the  betterment  of
all and, more so in this case, when the amendments  are  in  line  with  the
Public  Finance  Management  Act,  no  progressive  individual  should  find
difficulty in supporting the Bill as amended.

We from the province of KwaZulu-Natal,  the  kingdom  of  the  Zulus,  fully
support the Cultural Laws Second Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

During the negotiating mandate stage, KwaZulu-Natal  proposed  a  number  of
amendments and sought some clarification. It was  heartening  to  note  that
all our concerns were adequately addressed.

With regard to clause 1(b) KwaZulu-Natal suggested that  the  provisions  of
section 6(4)(a), (b) and (c) must be applicable to  a  flagship  institution
declared under section 3(4). Effectively, the chief executive officer  of  a
flagship institution declared under section 3(4) should  be  the  accounting
officer of the flagship institution, should serve a renewable term  of  five
years and must enter into a performance agreement with the relevant  council
before taking up his or her post of chief executive officer. We  record  our
appreciation to the department for  the  favourable  consideration  of  this
submission.

Clause 3 was also amended after our submission. The KwaZulu-Natal  committee
in the NCOP sought clarity on the reasons for a different time  limit  being
set in respect of tabling when Parliament is sitting, namely within 14  days
of receipt of the report, and when Parliament is not sitting,  within  seven
day of the next sitting of Parliament.

The motivation in the explanatory memorandum appeared  to  be  that  similar
amendments were proposed in  the  Cultural  Laws  Amendment  Bill.  However,
clause 2 of the Cultural Laws Amendment Bill provides that  a  copy  of  the
report must be tabled in Parliament within 14 days after receipt thereof  if
Parliament is then sitting or within 14 days after the commencement  of  the
next sitting of Parliament.

We were pleased to note that an amendment was effected, under  the  proposed
subsection 6 (8) on page 4, line 17, substituting ``seven days''  with  ``14
days''.

Arising out of a submission of KwaZulu-Natal, in clause 8 on  page  4,  line
42, the words ``as the council may determine'' were deleted.

KwaZulu-Natal sought  clarity  in  the  negotiating  mandate  stage  on  the
reasons for the change in the status quo. In  most  pieces  of  legislation,
the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister  of  Finance,  determines
the honoraria and  reimbursements  for  expenses.  The  committee  requested
information  to  ascertain  what  necessitated  the  change  in  favour   of
providing for  the  Minister,  with  the  concurrence  of  the  Minister  of
Finance, to determine broad criteria  for  the  payment  whilst  the  actual
determination was left to the council.

In addition, the committee sought clarity on what would be the  position  if
the Minister failed to determine the  criteria  timeously.  We  are  pleased
that this aspect has also been adequately addressed.

In conclusion, we wish to place on record our heartfelt thanks  to  the  hon
the Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, Dr B S  Ngubane,  for
the excellent work he is doing to promote culture in  this  diverse  country
of ours. The hon the Minister is the greatest  asset  in  South  Africa;  we
must treasure his presence on our soil. Long  live  the  hon  the  Minister.
[Applause.]

Mr R Z NOGUMLA: Chairperson, Minister and hon  members,  the  Cultural  Laws
Second Amendment Bill seeks to  make  provision  for  the  establishment  of
alternative institutions in order to ensure optimal  and  efficient  use  of
limited resources. This has become more urgent, given  the  fact  that  some
museums have become  public  companies.  In  so  doing,  they  now  have  to
subscribe to the demands and requirements of the Public  Finance  Management
Act. As I speak, some of these museums are operating outside  the  ambit  of
the Public Finance Management Act, hence the need for  higher  standards  of
auditing and financial reporting.

I am tempted to quickly respond to what the hon  Van  Niekerk  said  to  the
House. [Interjections.] Firstly, on behalf of my province, I appreciate  the
diligent work that has been done by the department. The  amending  proposals
that the member is raising have nothing to  do  with  the  attitude  of  the
department. The department did its homework. Those amendments were  supposed
to have been directed to our provinces. We discussed them in our  provinces.
We agreed with the amendments that were put forward,  and  also  with  those
that were accepted on our part by the department.

If the member, or that province, would like our provinces to agree with  it,
they should have approached us. They should have debated with  us,  and  not
accuse the department that they did not accept their amendments. They  would
not have accepted their amendments if there  was  no  consensus.  They  only
accepted amendments that were agreed upon by the committee.

This Bill also has  as  its  objective  the  inculcation  of  a  culture  of
corporate governance in these institutions. This will greatly contribute  to
the creation and promotion of arts,  culture  and  heritage.  It  will  also
ensure that the institutions make maximum use  of  the  resources  at  their
disposal. The spin-offs of this  pooling  of  resources,  and  the  inherent
savings, can be utilised for national promotion  and  awareness  initiatives
for the benefit of the wider community.

Another important feature  of  the  Bill  is  that  it  will  encourage  the
implementation of sound business principles and planning,  and  ensure  that
it  is  aligned  with  the  Public  Finance  Management   Act.   Performance
management, particularly at the level of CEO, forms  part  of  the  critical
elements that have been introduced through this  Bill.  The  appointment  of
boards which bring expertise, knowledge  and  skills,  and  people  who  are
regarded as custodians of the arts  and  cultural  heritage,  also  form  an
integral part of these amendments.

Such  custodianship  goes  with  the  responsibility  that  touches  on  the
integrity of the institution, the integrity in terms of  the  management  of
financial affairs of the institutions and the  integrity  in  terms  of  the
constitutional mandate which guarantees cultural rights to all the  citizens
of the country. These responsibilities  cannot  be  taken  lightly,  because
they are at the core of the democratic  principles  of  our  country.  If  a
board's operations run counter to such  principles  and  its  interests  are
inimical to the bigger interests of the nation, it  serves  only  to  derail
the huge gains that  have  been  made,  and  it  cannot  be  entrusted  with
custodianship.

In conclusion, my province is convinced  that  the  amendments  are  to  the
benefit of the public. They are geared to enhancing the performance  of  the
associated  institutions.  They  will  improve   governance   and   increase
productivity in the heritage sector.

The Eastern Cape supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon delegates,  if  one  wants  to
lead, one must  first  learn  to  be  led.  Then  one  can  understand  what
leadership is.

The other thing is that the question of mind-set in this particular  era  in
which we are living is critical. Hon members  need  to  understand  that  if
other people differ from them in their opinions and  views,  that  does  not
mean the end of the world. We are dealing here with transformation,  and  we
have to be very objective to accept what is good in front of us. I  want  to
put it very clearly that the department has played a  very  objective  part.
They have participated, and I am sure they are careful.

I  want  to  illustrate  briefly  two  issues  here.  When  we  met  on  the
negotiating mandate, we agreed that the  amendments  we  had  brought  about
must be sent to the provinces. They have been sent  to  the  provinces.  And
the provinces have responded  by  making  final  mandates,  because  we  are
dealing here with a section 76 Bill. It is not a question of  Kgware  as  an
individual. It is a matter of the collective from the  provinces,  and  that
mandate must be respected.

It was on that position that I had to put my foot  down,  particularly  when
some people come  with  individualism  and  self-interest  to  a  particular
committee. I want to put it very clearly that at that meeting I had to  take
a stance. I am not a person who is always hard. But if things  go  wrong,  I
have to put my foot down to protect the interests of the provinces. That  is
my duty, and that is what I am paid for.

To Ms Rossouw I want to say that there is an element of transformation.  The
Western Cape has done what it has done. It has a different view. However,  I
want to indicate that we are nine provinces. We are sisters.  We  are  nine.
We cannot be seen to be living as an island. We need to build together  with
her so that we move along in this process of transformation, and  that  will
assist the Western Cape in most of the cases. [Interjections.]

To the other hon member I want to say that mandate of the province that  the
member comes from, the Northern Cape - the same province that I come from  -
is in support. They have been discussing this,  unless  we  undermine  their
decision.  [Interjections.]  But  they   have   sent   their   mandate   in.
[Interjections.] So that member cannot be seen to  come  here  and  to  talk
differently from what that member's  province  has  said.  This  is  what  I
wanted to indicate  -  that  this  is  not  true.  [Interjections.]  Certain
elements of members have got their own vested interests in this issue.  This
is not a question of transformation.

I want to say that we have done very well, and the results are  very  clear.
The report is there. Out of nine provinces, we have  the  support  of  eight
provinces. I must also say that Gauteng  has  done  sterling  work  in  this
instance. If one takes the viewpoints that have been provided there,  it  is
quite good. Some of them have been captured very well in this. I  liked  the
suggestion that was put forward that if there are  some  other  issues  that
have been left out, we still  have  another  few  years  to  transform  this
country. We will not be able  to  do  it  instantly.  This,  I  think,  they
understood. I do not think we should be involving other  provinces  if  they
have a different view on this matter.

I just want to echo my colleagues in that I am prepared  to  participate  in
terms of conducting some workshops with them. They  might  undermine  me  at
this level, but I am capable of conducting a workshop around  transformation
in particular, so that they understand. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson, I  would
like to thank the representatives -  the  delegates  from  provinces  -  and
members of the National  Council  of  Provinces  who  have  supported  these
amendments. I would like to say to the hon Van Niekerk and hon Rossouw  that
we cannot keep the status quo: 1994 was a defining moment in the history  of
this country. From  the  narrow  perspectives  of  previous  governments  we
opened up South Africa to everyone.

The things they are fighting to maintain exclude  the  majority  of  people.
[Interjections.] The transformation that we have asked for  with  regard  to
our cultural institutions has not happened.

Therefore  it  becomes  important  that  we  hold  the  councils  and  their
chairpersons accountable to the Government priorities of transformation,  as
the hon Kgware and other members have so  eloquently  put  it.  We  are  not
trying to bulldoze anything here, or to  take  over  unnecessary  power.  We
want accountability. Even the Public Finance Management Act  demands  of  us
to be accountable.

A chairperson of a board is not an elected official. A  council  is  not  an
elected group of officials. They are there not only to assist  the  Ministry
and the department but also to  co-ordinate  with  the  community.  So  they
should represent community interests. But what have we seen up  to  now?  If
one goes to some museums one wonders if they  are  actually  addressing  the
cultural issues of South Africa. And yet we have been  able  to  be  patient
with all this. The people of this country have been  very  patient.  But  we
cannot just test this patience to the limit. We have to respond.

The museums are very important in the education  of  the  children  of  this
country. Are they performing that  function?  They  are  very  important  in
bringing together and reconciling cultures, and creating  understanding  and
dialogue. Are they performing that function? If we did a  serious  audit  of
the performance of our cultural institutions most of them  would  come  very
short.

I do agree that there are good intentions and that the chairpersons  of  the
northern and southern flagships are  fully  committed  to  serving  all  the
people of this country, but there are elements within  the  system  that  do
not understand this type of thinking.

All I am asking is that the councils and the  boards  share  their  business
plans with us, so that we can always introduce  a  dimension  of  a  greater
good for this country. They may not see it most of the  time.  They  may  be
very professionally competent but seeing the greater  good  in  whatever  we
do, at all levels of government, is the objective. That is  why  the  people
voted  for  this  Government.  We  are  determined,  in  a  systematic   and
responsible way, to exact accountability.

We have had very serious experiences of maladministration  because  we  were
observing what we called arm's  length,  but  that  arm's  length  has  been
abused. Therefore we need to create greater  accountability.  We  cannot  be
true to our mandate and to the  duties  that  we  owe  the  people  of  this
country if we do not do this, and these amendments aim at achieving  exactly
this purpose.

We are not trying to take museums away  from  local  government  in  Durban.
There is no such intention. But we  clearly  realise  that  the  Voortrekker
Museum, the Natal Museum and Ncome Museum must be administered and  governed
under the one board, so that there is saving of money;  there  is  only  one
board or one council to oversee work in all of them.

We will provide for honoraria and so on because when  we  take  people  from
their jobs to perform these tasks there must  be  something  that  at  least
compensates them for the time spent. Those will not be  exorbitant  amounts.
Those will be amounts negotiated with the Minister of Finance.  Wherever  we
give benefits they are always well thought out and well calculated.

The issue of the performing arts institutions is  a  very  serious  one.  We
have lost millions of taxpayers' money, public money, because  of  the  fact
that they were section 21 companies, and there  was  very  little  that  the
Minister could do. The Minister could only request. In fact, I  asked  Judge
Heath, when he was still looking into this issue, whether I could, in  fact,
just get the money out of the State  Theatre.  He  said  to  me:  ``No,  you
cannot. You will have to liquidate  the  company.''  If  that  had  happened
there would be no State Theatre today. We mothballed the  State  Theatre  to
enable it to pass through this very difficult phase where huge  claims  were
going to come up against it, and the equipment and all the  treasures  would
disappear. So we have been very responsible all along.

However, we are now bringing all these things under one  umbrella  in  terms
of these amendments. We do not want to harm  the  arts.  We  will  never  do
that. We will  never  interfere  with  the  programmes.  But  certainly  the
governance and the administration must be an accountable one.

As far as the PanSALB Board is concerned, the process is going  on  and  the
standing committees are working on this matter,  and  I  am  awaiting  their
recommendations and have not yet received them. As soon as that  process  is
finalised, there will be a full compliment of the PanSALB.

I think that most of the issues that were raised by members here  have  been
very relevant. The fact that it gives a stigma if the Minister appoints  the
chairperson is a language that I really do not  understand,  because  we  do
appoint the council. What is wrong with appointing the chairperson as  well?
This is done within the sphere of the responsibility  of  the  Minister  and
Cabinet approves it.

With regard to the fear that we are not consulting,  we  have  Minmecs  that
meet at least four times a year, and we discuss  this  with  the  executives
from the  provinces.  [Interjections.]  I  would  really  like  to  ask  our
colleagues because I do not like talking party  politics.  This  is  a  very
honourable House, a very allowed place. It represents the  people  of  South
Africa and their participation in  national  legislation  very  competently.
So, I do not expect the types of debates that one could  have,  probably  in
the National Assembly, at party-political level.

But nevertheless, I would like to appeal  to  the  DA  and  its  constituent
parts to please be constructive. They should just  contribute  something  to
the transformation of this country. [Applause.] They  should  not  stand  at
the margins  and  simply  shout  invectives  and  all  that.  We  are  about
transformation and confirming  and  consolidating  the  reconciliation  that
former president Mandela started in this country.  Let  us  not,  therefore,
fret away the huge  historical  opportunities.  [Interjections.]  These  hon
members' people elected them, but I do not think that they elected  them  to
do this rubbish. [Interjections.] They elected them  to  contribute  to  the
development of this country so that all of us and our children can  live  in
peace and prosperity. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
