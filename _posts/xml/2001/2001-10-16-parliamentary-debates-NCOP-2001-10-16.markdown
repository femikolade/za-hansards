                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, I will move at the next sitting of this House:


  That the Council -


  (1) views with alarm the steps taken on 15 October  by  President  Robert
       Mugabe to return his country to a socialist-styled command economy;
  (2) notes that the  inevitable  consequence  of  the  price  freezes  and
       unrealistic wage increases announced on 15 October will be -


       (a)  growing food shortages;


       (b)   additional  business  closures  and  further  cuts  in  primary
           production of food; and


       (c)  job losses and hyperinflation;


  (3) further notes that these measures, coming as they do in  addition  to
       the  illegal  commercial  farm  occupations,  with   some   350   000
       farmworkers already displaced, are likely  to  compound  the  growing
       economic chaos in that country; and


  (4) calls  upon  the  South  African  Government  to  begin  establishing
       reconstruction  plans  and  to   initiate   a   large   international
       redevelopment  trust  fund,  perhaps  under  the  umbrella   of   the
       Commonwealth Secretariat, to assist in stabilising that  neighbouring
       country in  the  inevitable  post-Mugabe  period,  once  the  current
       madness has run its course.

Mev J WITBOOI: Voorsitter, hiermee gee ek kennis  dat  ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Raad gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die  onreg  wat  die  Afrikaanse  en  ander  inheemse
       taalgemeenskappe aangedoen is deur die  eentalige  sensusopname,  wat
       net in Engels gedoen word;


  (2) van mening is dat dit onverklaarbaar  en  onaanvaarbaar  is  dat  die
       taaldiversiteit en die grondwetlike verpligting wat op die staat  rus
       deur die departement verantwoordelik vir statistiekdienste ge√Øgnoreer
       is;


  (3) voorts die mening uitspreek dat die korrektheid van die  sensusopname
       as gevolg hiervan onder verdenking sal wees;


  (4) kennis neem dat die hele aangeleentheid by  Pansat  gerapporteer  is,
       met die versoek dat hulle dringend ingryp  en  die  situasie  probeer
       red; en


(5)   die betrokke Minister versoek om in hierdie verband antwoorde aan  ons
       te verstrek.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mrs J WITBOOI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the  next  sitting
of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the injustice being done to  the  Afrikaans  and  other
       indigenous language communities as a result of the unilingual  census
       survey being conducted in English only;


  (2) is of the opinion that it is inexplicable and unacceptable  that  the
       language diversity and the constitutional obligation, which rests  on
       the state,  is  being  ignored  by  the  department  responsible  for
       statistical services;


  (3) furthermore expresses the opinion that the correctness of the  census
       survey will come under suspicion as a result of this;


  (4) takes note that the entire matter has been reported to PanSALB,  with
       the request that they intervene immediately to  try  and  rescue  the
       situation; and


  (5) requests the Minister concerned to provide us with  answers  in  this
       regard.]

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the street renaming debacle in the Western Cape has  taken
       a new twist that threatens to destroy the political alliance  between
       the DP and the New NP;


  (2) further notes that the ANC has warned from the  very  beginning  that
       any alliance aimed at perpetuating past privileges and the  exclusion
       of African people in the Western Cape is doomed to fail;


  (3) believes the singling out of Peter Marais proves that  the  mayor  is
       like a pawn in a much bigger struggle;


  (4) further believes that this is a struggle in which the DP,  which  has
       proved itself to  be  an  irredeemable  representative  of  apartheid
       privileges and which has been supported by very  few  voters  in  the
       province, is trying to steal control  of  the  Western  Cape  at  the
       expense of the poor and marginalised African and coloured majority in
       the province;


  (5) acknowledges the negative impact which the irreconcilable differences
       within the Democratic Alliance have on the implementation of national
       policy and programmes aimed at  improving  the  quality  of  life  of
       people in the province; and


  (6) therefore calls on the New NP to reconsider its alliance with the  DP
       because this represents the best hope for the poor  and  marginalised
       majority in the Western Cape ...

[Time expired.]

       HIV/AIDS EDUCATION UNIT IN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with appreciation  the  formation  of  the  HIV/Aids  education
       structure in  the  Department  of  Correctional  Services,  as  their
       strategy to fight HIV/Aids;


  (2) further notes that the creation of this structure  is  for  promotive
       and preventive measures in the fight against the HIV/Aids pandemic;


  (3) notes that, since the inauguration of this unit, more prisoners  have
       come forward for blood testing and counselling; and


  (4) applauds the department  for  introducing  educational  measures  for
       prisoners that will eventually lessen the spread of infection  within
       the prison.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

 AWARD OF HONORARY DOCTORATE TO DEPUTY PRESIDENT BY UNIVERSITY OF THE NORTH

                             (Draft Resolution)
Ms S N NTLABATI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with pride the conferring of an honorary  doctorate  on  Deputy
       President Jacob Zuma by the University of the North;


  (2) further notes that with this honour, Deputy President Zuma's name  is
       added to an eminent list which already bears  the  names  of  African
       luminaries such as the late comrades Oliver Tambo and Julius  Nyerere
       as well as former President Nelson Mandela;


  (3) believes this award is an acknowledgement of the role played  by  the
       Deputy President in  highlighting  the  importance  of  education  in
       building a nonracial, nonsexist, democratic and  prosperous  society;
       and


  (4) further believes that the conferral of this award will inspire others
       to pursue the same moral and intellectual virtues.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                  SIGNING OF PUBLIC SERVICE WAGE AGREEMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) welcomes the signing of the wage agreement between the Government and
       the public service sector unions;


  (2) expresses its relief that  the  signing  has  averted  a  potentially
       damaging strike  of  public  servants  that  would  have  had  severe
       consequences for the upcoming matric exams in particular and  service
       delivery in general;
  (3) commends the Minister for the Public Service and Administration,  her
       department and staff as well as trade union representatives  for  the
       amicable manner in which they have resolved the wage dispute; and


  (4) believes the agreement confirms the commitment of our ANC  Government
       as well as trade unions to work together in partnership to  implement
       a better deal for South African workers.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                  COMMEMORATION OF PRESIDENT SAMORA MACHEL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T S SETONA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the successful commemoration and celebration of the life of one
       of Africa's greatest, courageous patriots and a wise and  intelligent
       leader, the honourable former President Samora Machel of  Mozambique,
       which was held last Friday in Johannesburg;


  (2) recognises the importance of such occasions to  the  history  of  our
       people and especially to the youth of today;


  (3) commends the celebration of the lives of our leaders who played a big
       role on the African  continent  for  the  African  people  and  their
       liberation, an important role in the installation of  African  pride,
       identity, esteem and patriotism in  our  people,  in  particular  the
       young; and


  (4) thanks the family of the honourable former  President  Samora  Machel
       for their assistance in making this memorable occasion possible.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

             OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Chairperson and  hon
members, it is not often that I speak in this House twice  in  a  week.  The
circumstances are quite different  from  the  last  statement  that  I  made
before this House and there have been indications, already, that we are  all
aware  of  these  changed  circumstances  around  issues  related   to   the
conditions of service dispensation.

This afternoon we are  dealing  with  the  question  of  accountability  and
oversight in the Public Service and I am going to reflect fairly broadly  on
these issues.  As  all  hon  members  are  aware  the  White  Paper  on  the
Transformation of the Public Service captures  the  vision  for  the  Public
Service as we are  building  a  national  democratic  state  and  it  is  as
follows, and I quote:


  The Government is committed to  continually  improve  the  lives  of  the
  people of South Africa through a  transformed  Public  Service  which  is
  representative, coherent, transparent, efficient, effective,  accountable
  and responsive to the needs of all.

As I said last week, we cannot  achieve  this  through  mere  statements  or
rhetoric. It requires hard work,  commitment  and  focus  from  all  of  us,
including members of this House.

Accountability and transparency, according to this vision, are  two  of  the
key characteristics of the Public Service that we are trying  to  build  and
that will allow us to continually improve the quality of the  lives  of  our
people. As such, it constitutes part of the normative base of  the  emerging
new Public Service of South Africa.

Accountability is part of the contract between Government and the people  in
which the people, quite correctly, demand control  over  the  use  of  state
power, power that Government only enjoys through the grace of its  citizens;
or, as we stated in the Freedom Charter, only a government that  can  justly
claim authority will be able to take  the  whole  concept  of  ``the  people
governing'' forward. The people expect Government  to  explain  and  account
publicly for the way in which it governs and to take prompt  and  corrective
action when things go wrong.

South Africa is a modern democracy that has not shied  away  from  providing
institutional bases that are supportive of an accountability principle  that
combines best practice that is known, in this field. The  institutions  that
we have created  cover  both  horizontal  and  vertical  dimensions  of  the
accountability relationship.

The horizontal accountability dimension  typically  includes  the  range  of
institutions created by Government  to  check  abuses  and  inefficiency  of
itself and, obviously, of broader society in  those  instances  through  the
mechanisms that have been set up; that is, the internal  locus  of  control.
On  the  horizontal  dimension  we  find  the  judiciary,   of   which   the
Constitutional Court plays a particularly powerful  role,  the  legislature,
of which the NCOP is part,  and  all  the  committees  and  structures  that
support  the  work  of  the  legislature.  It  also   includes   Chapter   9
institutions such as the Auditor-General, the Public Service Commission  and
the Public Protector, to mention but a few.

However, it is only when these  institutions  of  horizontal  accountability
are   strengthened,   protected   and   underpinned   by   strong   vertical
accountability that any government is likely to bind itself to  the  broader
implications of horizontal accountability.

South  Africa  maintains  vertical  accountability  through  the   electoral
process. We are all thus  elected  representatives  and  have  to  create  a
conducive environment within which civil society  can  assume  the  role  it
plays and facilitate interaction with Government, the legislature, etc,  and
this includes the presence of a strong and responsible media.

In addition to the structured organisational  terrain,  we  have  created  a
legislative framework that empowers the  structures  of  accountability.  As
far as an accountable  Public  Service  goes,  some  of  the  most  powerful
legislation that we have put in place includes the Public  Service  Act  and
its accompanying regulations,  the  Public  Service  Code  of  Conduct,  the
Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, the Public Finance  Management  Act
and the Promotion of Access to Information Act.

Accountability is not a single event or even a series of events, nor  is  it
contained in the establishment of structures or organisations alone.  It  is
a complicated and densely woven  cloth  of  different  relationships  across
various institutions and role-players. It is  also  not  static.  Contextual
changes and developments continually influence it and accountability  adapts
and  responds  to  these  changes  in  a  very  dynamic   manner.   However,
accountability is also not straightforward. Other than what many would  wish
us to believe, the accountability grid contains a  myriad  of  dilemmas  and
paradoxes, and I am going to touch on a few of them this afternoon.

There   is,   for   example,   a   challenge   of   centralisation    versus
decentralisation dichotomy for accountability. The  most  recent  trends  in
the  area  of  public  administration  include   maximum   decentralisation,
devolution,  commercialisation  and  privatisation   of   service   delivery
arrangements. Please, let us let the  managers  manage.  As  representatives
from provinces, hon members come into contact with this  all  time.  Central
to  that  is  the  idea  of  enhancing  flexibility  and  allowing  improved
responsiveness to localised conditions.  However,  given  the  loosening  of
central  controls,  these  arrangements  also  present  new  challenges  for
maintaining proper  accountability  arrangements,  be  they  administrative,
financial or, especially, political. It requires,  one  could  argue,  great
finesse for the executive to  maintain  political  oversight  over  outcomes
produced and for Parliament and its structures to keep a watchful  eye  over
this.

Another  set   of   phenomena   with   equally   strong   implications   for
accountability are those where we are moving away  from  departmentalism  in
the interests of the  so-called  seamless  government,  and  where  we  move
across geographically defined spheres of government in the interests of  co-
operative governance.

The Minister for Provincial and Local Government was at the NCOP last  week,
regarding the discussion around the issue of finances and all that. He  also
reflected on the challenges,  I  believe,  around  some  of  the  myriad  of
relationships they need to manage from  a  national,  provincial  and  local
government level, looking,  for  example,  at  the  whole  Integrated  Rural
Development Programme that is being unfurled and how we deal with this.

In  this  instance,  sectors  are  encouraged  to  move  beyond  traditional
boundaries.  They  are  encouraged  to  review  the  departmental  level  of
government, and private, public and  community  sectors.  Partnerships  have
become a common mechanism for  delivery  against  public  goods.  Now  these
networked arrangements obviously have a number of advantages.

However,  hierarchical  accountability   is   a   contradiction   in   these
circumstances. Any of these organisational forms for service delivery  needs
particularly  strong  skills  in  terms  of  design  of  the  accountability
framework, as  part  of  the  attention  to  be  given  to  the  variety  of
dimensions in terms of performance being agreed upon. I think  these  are  a
kind of challenge hon members need to  confront  as  they  deal  with  these
issues.

Another area, or a second area that I want  to  touch  on  briefly,  is,  of
course,  assessing  the  impact  of  current  accountability   practice   on
improving Public Service delivery. What can we  do  to  make  it  work  even
better? As I mentioned earlier on, South Africa does not have a shortage  of
structures and institutions  operating  in  the  terrain  of  oversight  and
accountability.  The  performance   management   culture   that   is   being
incorporated  into  public  management,   together   with   approaches   and
techniques such as review, monitoring, evaluation and other tools,  will  go
some way towards strengthening the ability  of  administrative  agencies  to
meaningfully participate in accountability and oversight initiatives.

If there  is  a  single  aspect  that  is  tripping  up  accountability  and
oversight initiatives  it  is  the  shortage  of  systematically  collecting
accurate and timely  information,  both  qualitatively  and  quantitatively,
that would allow the  accountability  institution  to  authoritatively  make
conclusions about Government action in an appropriate manner.

In our own situation of being a developing country that  has  hitherto,  but
not necessarily adequately,  prioritised  issues  of  evidence-based  policy
decision-making, outcomes-based  policy  evaluation  and  sound  information
systems, I think we need to ensure that we have appropriate practices,  that
we have reliable, accurate and timely information, and that  we  should  not
see this as a luxury, but rather as a common phenomenon.
I said once before to  this  House  that  to  deal  with  issues  of  public
service, what do we need to do to make it better? To engage on questions  of
accountability may lead to what, I believe, someone  called  Marc  Lottering
calls the 12 languages - that is what he claims I speak -  a  language  that
uses terms and may not always be user-friendly. What I am  trying  to  point
towards is that there are certain technical things that we  need  to  review
rather closely in order to ensure that we  do  have  on  the  table  and  do
utilise appropriately the accountability frameworks that we have access to.

Let me talk a little bit about accountability institutions. When we look  at
the issue of capacity of those institutions, we need to  open  up  an  issue
that may be a little bit tricky and easily misinterpreted, but  I  am  going
to do that this afternoon. The questions are: Who is watching the  oversight
bodies? Who is checking that they act in efficient ways  and  are  avoiding,
as far as possible, duplication  of  efforts  seeking  greater  co-operation
between themselves?

We are starting to notice  reports  emanating  from  different  institutions
that are essentially dealing with the same issues. How  do  we  ensure  that
oversight bodies do not develop a turf war  between  themselves,  developing
empires that  were  never  intended  or  taking  up  personal  or  parochial
interests that are to the detriment of the broader  South  African  society?
Who is responsible for ensuring that  the  manner  in  which  accountability
institutions are working is  constructive  and  developmental,  rather  than
high-handed and judgmental?

Let me give one example. The Public Service  Commission  much  earlier  this
year or late last year did a report on leave in  the  Public  Service.  They
proposed solutions to this  particular  question,  and  made  proposals  and
recommendations that have already been  implemented  by  the  Department  of
Public  Service  and  Administration,  to  be  effected  within  the  Public
Service. Three weeks ago we had a similar report being presented before  the
Joint Committee on Public Finances by the Auditor-General.
I raise this issue because, I believe, this is  where  legislators  need  to
play a role. One needs to actually be  able  to  cross-refer  and  not  say,
``Oh, is this new?'' and rather say, ``This has come before. Let us go  back
to the other report and see whether the work has been done.'' I think  these
are some of the challenges of accountability.

We have a situation in which, I believe, we all together should  say,  ``How
do we bring things together in order to ensure that the accountability  that
is required is effected in the true sense, that the oversight role  that  is
required to be played, from the side of legislators, is done in an  informed
manner?

We need to ensure that we in the executive come and give account and  engage
with issues, as we are attempting to do  today,  in  order  to  take  things
forward. I think this, as an introduction, could probably contribute to  the
kinds of issues that should and will come up later. [Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  since  the
establishment of the NCOP in 1996 it has faced considerable  challenges.  As
a new institution with a unique mandate, it has had to flesh  out  the  role
outlined for it in the Constitution so that  it  can  provide  an  effective
bridge between provinces and the national Government.

One of these is its oversight role. Oversight, of course,  is  the  role  of
legislators in monitoring and reviewing the actions of the executive  organs
of the state. The South African Constitution has many  expectations  of  the
National Council of Provinces in relation to oversight. But oversight  is  a
broad term used for a wide range of activities in many different contexts.

The National Council of Provinces's role in oversight is to draw  provincial
and local experience into the national  debate  when  the  effectiveness  of
policy and its implementation is considered. This ensures  that  the  centre
remains sensitive to the conditions and  needs  of  everyone.  At  the  same
time, while drawing provincial and local government  together  in  a  single
forum,  the  NCOP  facilitates  sharing  of  experiences  and  ideas   among
provinces and local government.

Oversight can help identify common  problems  and  best  practices,  thereby
strengthening the capacity of every level of  government.  Because  of  this
special role, this Council must carry  out  its  constitutional  mandate  on
oversight in a way that is distinct from all other legislative bodies.  This
was underscored by the hon President Mbeki during his first address to  this
House in October 1999, when he said (Hansard 1999, col 579):


  It has been suggested that the NCOP should devise ways in which it  could
  have closer interaction with the provincial legislatures to ensure, among
  other things, that it has access to  the  reports  which  the  provincial
  executives present to the legislatures. This would enable the NCOP to get
  a firm grasp of the progress being made and the problems  experienced  in
  the process of governing the provinces.
  Because the Council also has the  possibility  of  interacting  with  the
  national executive, it has therefore  been  suggested  that  the  Council
  would thus be in a position to contribute to ensuring better co-operation
  between these spheres of government.

In considering the oversight role of the NCOP in relation to the  Department
for the Public Service and Administration, our point of departure should  be
the extent to which provincial departments have been  transformed,  and  how
they impact on service delivery. It is common  knowledge  that  the  Gauteng
province has made the  most  progress  with  regard  to  transformation  and
representivity, while the Western Cape reflects the least transformation.

Flowing from this,  we  also  need  to  examine  the  programmes  that  were
implemented to  bolster  human  resource  and  skills  development,  and  to
enhance service delivery. Human resource and skills development are  two  of
the major challenges facing our democracy. Thus  it  is  absolutely  crucial
for  the  improvement  of  living  standards,  increased  productivity   and
competitiveness in the world markets.

The imperatives  for  social  transformation  and  the  urgency  of  service
delivery to all  communities,  especially  the  poor,  require  a  competent
public service. Thus, training and development are crucial instruments.

Because this House provides the ideal platform for provinces  to  articulate
their historical disadvantage and successes, it is,  indeed,  an  honour  to
share with the Minister  her  department's  huge  strides  towards  removing
these inequalities  in  the  legislation  and  exercise  of  provincial  and
Government affairs. Some of  these  include  transformation  in  the  Public
Service, the Batho Pele policies and  a  series  of  White  Papers  on  such
issues as human resource management and affirmative  action  in  the  Public
Service, which culminated in the amendments to the Public Service Act.

In another effort to extend support to departments, the Department  for  the
Public Service and Administration engaged  donors  to  support  wide-ranging
interventions in areas of need. To this end, the  department  initiated  the
Integrated Provincial Support Programme  to  support  some  efforts  in  the
provinces.

Over the past year, the department has also  developed  innovative  ways  of
ensuring delivery through the use  of  appropriate  information  technology.
One of these is  the  creation  of  the  Government  Information  Technology
Officers Council. The main objective of this council is the creation  of  an
e-government initiative with an emphasis on the application  of  information
technology  to  intergovernmental  operations,  including  the   interaction
between central, provincial and local governments.

This,  of  course,  include   paperless   messaging,   electronic   document
management and archiving, and an integrated system  for  finance  and  human
resource management and training. The flagship of  this  initiative,  called
Project Kite, is at present situated in the Presidency.
It will also contribute, to a large extent, to the imparting of  information
to the provinces in  a  co-ordinated  fashion.  Moreover,  it  will  address
issues of common concern and improve provinces'  capacity  to  fulfil  their
responsibilities.  For  example,  it  will  lead  to  the  establishment  of
benchmarks.

We have seen over the past two years how  the  Government  has  shifted  its
focus from policy development to ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, I must say that it is a pleasure to have the  hon
the Minister here on repeated occasions. She may come more often.

We have just seen the introduction of the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review
2001, hailed by the  Minister  of  Finance  as  a  tool  to  strengthen  the
oversight function of Parliament. In  his  speech  before  this  House  last
week, he said:


  Problems are less an issue of money and policy. The difficulty lies  with
  the Public Service to achieve delivery, in short,  what  happens  in  the
  lives of people.

It is at this level that our responsibilities must be tested. Citizens  have
the right to know, not only what the  Government  intends  to  achieve,  but
what it has actually accomplished. Evaluating this information  is  a  major
responsibility of legislators, who must oversee Public  Service  performance
to  ensure  accountability  to  the  voters,  whether  as  taxpayers  or  as
recipients of public services.

This House is often the scene of provincial  reflection  on  activities  and
aims, rather than on  actual  performance.  Critical  evaluation  of  Public
Service performance requires loyalty to the voters, which  should  transcend
political priorities. Unfortunately, this approach has  been  observed  more
in the breach than in the execution.

The Government has been very successful in providing a  firm  framework  for
accountable  and  transparent  governance   in   national   and   provincial
government, in line with global trends, such as the passing  of  the  Public
Management Finance Act. At the same time, recommendations from a  body  such
as the Financial  and  Fiscal  Commission  have  not  been  adopted  by  the
Government, citing as a reason that it is not appropriate to have a  bottom-
up approach to determine  budgetary  priorities,  which  requires  political
judgment in making difficult trade-offs.

Yet we are constantly treated to the mantra of Batho Pele,  or  serving  the
poorest of the poor, as if  the  repetition  of  intent  will  automatically
convert to actual performance. I contend that this is the core problem  that
we, as servants of the  electorate,  are  having  to  deal  with:  a  choice
between real commitment to accountability and  service  to  the  people,  or
trade-offs between serving the  interests  of  a  political  elite  and  the
minimum service the public is prepared to accept.

It is at the level of our personal experience in our constituencies that  we
collect valid facts and statistics, and no better place  for  the  President
this week to be stuck with his presidential  motorcade  than  in  ankle-deep
mud for hours, while trying to  make  his  way  to  the  Makhenkesi  Stofile
technical school. As a result of this exposure on the ground, as opposed  to
viewing the reality from 30 000 feet in the air, President Mbeki has  urged:
``We cannot put in place electricity and development without  looking  after
our roads.'' That is immediate oversight and accountability.  He  should  do
more travelling amongst the people.

Codes of conduct, reams of legislation, commissions, institutions  and  good
intentions are all OK, but we  have  clinics  without  medicines,  and  even
without doctors. We have classrooms without books.

In my area there is a very well-run school with over 1 000 pupils,  but  not
a single computer to help with the administrative load. In Welkom  there  is
a police station servicing people, but with not a  single  vehicle  in  use,
and the sight of policemen on borrowed bicycles performing their  duties  is
a common one.

Inmates of Kroonstad prison  can  acquire  skills  training  as  carpenters,
builders, metal  workers  etc.  However,  on  account  of  the  Government's
preferential procurement policy, which has the professed  aim  of  spreading
Government contracts to new businesses, supplies of basic materials  are  so
uneven, and the procedure for obtaining supplies so bureaucratic,  that  the
training in many spheres is virtually at a standstill. So much for  seamless
Government.

The MEC for education in the Free State - I can  also  mention  this  -  has
probably spent more  on  spurious  lost  court  cases  than  on  the  actual
improvement of education in the  province.  Nationally  the  expenditure  on
education has declined by about 9,5% since 1996, but the  flow  of  hot  air
has increased exponentially.

At another level, it is now happening with tedious regularity that the  same
names which are tied up in positions where they could  have  benefited  from
the arms contract appear in other such positions where money is being  made.
Yet we are constantly reminded of so-called budgetary  constraints  when  it
comes to medicines  for  Aids  victims,  support  for  victims  of  domestic
violence, increases for social services and grants, pot-holed roads, etc.

The call for taking care of people with Aids has reached  desperate  levels.
On the one hand, we have the  Minister  of  Finance  in  the  IFGR  claiming
mounting pressure from the  HIV/Aids  epidemic.  One  of  the  most  serious
challenges facing the public sector, he said, is  the  impact  of  HIV/Aids.
And a more concerted plan is  required  to  increase  training  in  critical
areas such as education,  health,  policing  and  justice.  [Time  expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! I call upon  Mr
J Home to address the House. Is it Horne or Home?

Mr J HORNE: Chairperson, hon Minister, special delegates from the  provinces
and hon members of the House, the oversight and accountability role  of  the
Public Service can never be overemphasised, especially as it  is  a  service
to the man in the street, whether he or she is rich or poor.

The needs and prestige of the Public Service are  in  the  hands  of  public
servants. They either break them down or build them up. It  only  takes  one
corruption case in  the  Public  Service  to  destroy  its  image.  This  is
confirmed daily in the various forms of media such as newspapers, radio  and
TV stations.

The question might well be asked: Who is responsible for the  oversight  and
accountability role in the Public Service? I  believe  that  it  rests  with
everybody, from the most junior official  in  the  department  to  the  most
senior, namely the Director-General. The selection criteria for  persons  to
be employed  in  the  Public  Service  need,  therefore,  to  be  looked  at
carefully.

I have no problem with affirmative action, as long as it is  accompanied  by
a constructive training programme that is regularly monitored  to  determine
whether or not the incumbent is suitable for the position.  Putting  persons
in positions of authority without the necessary  effective  supervision  has
led to many malpractices in the Public Service.

There  are  many  shortcomings  in  the  Public  Service  that  need  urgent
attention. For example, there  need  to  be  effective  training  programmes
which must be monitored to determine the success thereof.

Public servants ought to be proud of  the  work  that  flows  through  their
hands  and  display  in  the  execution  thereof  the  necessary  sense   of
responsibility, insight and organisation. If they make this  their  approach
and adopt this attitude, it will  go  a  long  way  towards  protecting  and
promoting the image and  prestige  of  the  Public  Service  as  a  whole  -
something that is lacking at present.

Although the process of salary negotiations was not very easy  for  the  hon
the Minister, I would like to congratulate her  on  the  progress  that  has
been made in this regard. [Applause.]

Mrs  C  NKUNA:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  for  the  Public  Service   and
Administration Fraser-Moleketi, hon members  present  in  this  House,  when
citizens  vote  a  government  into  power,  they  entrust   it   with   the
responsibility of governing and managing resources. This has to be  achieved
through the Public Service, that is in line with the  democratic  principles
of the Government of the day. In this case the ANC Government.

We are moving away from a Public Service that was characterised by  lack  of
representivity and  legitimacy,  and  by  poor  and  discriminatory  service
delivery.  In  the  previous  dispensation,  one's  skin  colour  was  one's
curriculum vitae, and the best aspect of  it.  Now  people  have  to  apply,
submit their CVs and then be shortlisted, interviewed and appointed.

Our Public Service  was  characterised  by,  firstly,  centralised  control,
using the  top-down  management  system;  secondly,  lack  of  consultation;
thirdly, a lack of accountability and transparency; fourthly, an absence  of
an effective information system; and fifthly, poorly  paid  and  demotivated
staff. We now have the bargaining chamber, where the  unions  represent  the
workers and everybody negotiates salaries.  There  was  conflict  in  labour
relations, a lack of professional ethos and  of  a  work  ethic.  There  was
resistance to change. When I say ``resistance to change'', I am reminded  of
a principal who would tell the learners  that  the  ANC  was  not  going  to
govern this country, and that people were going to die before  their  actual
death. Yes, some are dead, some have survived and the ANC is governing.

The restructuring and transformation of the Public Service  was  first  done
in 1997 through the White Paper on  Transforming  Public  Service  Delivery,
and it dealt with the following aspects. The  first  was  consultation  with
citizens on the level and  quality  of  public  service  they  receive.  The
second was service standards: Citizens should be made aware of  the  quality
of service ... I apologise for the bad typescript.  Citizens  have  to  have
access to equal  services.  The  third  was  courtesy:  Citizens  should  be
treated with  courtesy  and  consideration.  The  fourth  was  openness  and
transparency:  Citizens  need  to  know  how  the  national  and  provincial
departments are run and who runs them. The community is able to make  a  lot
of noise because of openness and transparency. To me that is  delivery.  The
fifth was redress: Where a  department  or  the  Government  has  failed  to
fulfil its obligation, it has to apologise to the community.

The accounting officer must prepare financial statements for each  financial
year and also submit an annual report on the activities  of  the  department
during that financial year - thus ensuring that the  structure  and  content
of budget planning submission and annual reports are in alignment.

The question is: How should the Government account to  its  citizens?  Heads
of department must  prepare  an  annual  report  that  presents  fairly  its
performance against predetermined  objectives,  as  well  as  its  financial
position and submit it to the legislature at the end of  a  financial  year.
These annual reports are a mechanism by which a legislature can  assess  the
Government's performance by comparing what it intends to achieve  with  what
it actually achieves.

Sections 92(2) and 133 of the  Constitution  provide  that  members  of  the
Cabinet  and  of  the  executive  councils  of  the   provinces   are   both
individually and  collectively  accountable  to  Parliament  and  provincial
legislatures for the exercise of  their  powers  and  performance  of  their
functions. However, the Public Finance Management Act of 1999 provides  that
when the annual budget is tabled in Parliament the  accounting  officer  for
each department must submit measurable objectives  for  each  main  division
within the department vote.

Furthermore, section 40 of the Public Finance Management Act  provides  that
the accounting officer must prepare financial statements for each  financial
year and also submit an annual report on the activities  of  the  department
during the financial year - thus ensuring that the structure and content  of
budget planning submissions and annual reports are in alignment.
In conclusion, I would like  to  remark  about  the  brain  drain  that  was
referred to in this House some  time  back:  The  argument  that  a  lot  of
expertise is lost as a result people  being  left  out  of  the  appointment
processes. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, I first went to  the  dictionary  just  to  see
what these two words mean. An ``oversight'' means  a  mistake  made  without
noticing something, while ``accountability'' means answerability or to  have
to explain. Reduced to its  literal  meaning,  accountability  simply  means
that people should give reasons for conducting themselves  in  a  particular
manner, especially in a manner that is unacceptable. To give an example:  We
have teachers sometimes, or civil servants, who leave their posts to go  and
have liquor in the shebeens during working hours. We  also  have  situations
in which teachers abuse children. These forms of conduct  are  unacceptable.
These symptoms or actions signify a lack of accountability on  the  part  of
the  civil  servants.  The  argument  goes,  therefore,  that  every  public
functionary should at all times be in a position to give reasons for his  or
her administrative acts.

While we engage ourselves  in  interrogating  issues  that  are  within  the
domain of the Public Service, we  should  remind  ourselves  that  political
accountability holds equal significance for  the  purpose  of  avoiding  the
passage of policies that will not address the immediate needs of the  masses
on the ground.

The Public Service  is  riddled  with  corruption,  uninvolvement,  boredom,
dishonesty and reticence.  While  we  are  aware  that  civil  servants  are
equipped with work facilities such as duty sheets,  guides  on  methods  and
procedures,  staff  codes  and   financial   regulations,   the   need   for
administrative accountability amongst  civil  servants  remains  a  critical
issue.

Motivation is, to quote Mr Franken:


  ... a driving force in any individual which moves him or her to act in  a
  certain way. Practically spoken, it is what drives your employees to give
  their best for your business.

Proponents of this school of thought, such as Herzberg, Scott and  Mitchell,
rally around motivation as a factor that inspires high  responsibility.  The
mere salary and working conditions  will  only  keep  workers  on  the  job.
However, these factors cannot simply be underrated  because  nobody  can  be
motivated  to  work  without  pay.  Unfortunately  the  salary  and  working
conditions cannot promote workers' desire to increase performance. In  order
to  elevate  a  performance  to  an  above-average  level  or  even  to   an
exceptional level, civil servants have to be  committed;  they  should  have
ownership and maximise achievements.

Internal motivations have to be stimulated  within  the  civil  servants  to
enjoy the work itself; to have a deep and abiding belief in  the  importance
of the work done, the excitement and the pleasure of challenges. Most  civil
servants go to work because they must work and  not  because  they  want  to
work.
To  get  workers  to  enjoy  carrying  out  a  task  relates  to  pride   of
achievement. If the task itself is not a cause of pride for the  worker,  he
or she will not be motivated. The arguments advanced so far  revolve  around
one's conduct which should be accounted for in one's work environment.

Lastly, I would like to share this observation. The  problems  that  we  are
having in South Africa, apparently, which were perpetrated by the  apartheid
regime, arose because most black  workers  in  this  country  went  to  work
because they were merely tools. They never had ownership of  the  industries
in which they worked. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, one of  the  most  critical  challenges  in  the
transition to  establishing  democracy  in  South  Africa  is  the  need  to
reconcile the delivery of increased public services to the public.  What  is
most  noticeable  is  the  fact  that  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act
represents a radical departure  from  the  old  Exchequer  Acts  because  it
places more emphasis on accountabilty for  results,  that  is  outcomes  and
outputs.

The PFMA actually and essentially  locates  financial  management  within  a
performance management framework. The enhanced flow of  information  between
Parliament and national departments, provincial legislatures and  provincial
departments  should   greatly   improve   their   physical   oversight   and
accountability. Therefore we need to ensure that Parliament  and  provincial
legislatures play a pivotal role in ensuring that departments adhere to  the
reporting timeframes. They should also provide information that will  assist
their oversight function and become fully compliant with the PFMA.

The  results-oriented  approach  to  perfomance  management  requires   very
different skills which are in lamentably short supply in the public  sector.
Therefore accountability for results and value for  money  require  managers
that  should  have  initiative,  who  will  employ  the   public   resources
effectively and efficiently.

Therefore  a  delivery-oriented   Public   Service   would   hold   managers
responsible  for  their   results   rather   than   mere   compliance   with
administrative procedures. Managers must be given more managerial  authority
so that they can combine inputs at their disposal to  produce  output  cost-
effectively.  This  is  actually  in  line  with  the   provision   of   the
Constitution  which  says  that  all  members   of   Parliament   have   the
responsibility to practise these kinds of duties, but within the context  of
the provincial interest. [Applause.]

Mr T RALANE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, members, in his  book  The  Long
Walk to Freedom, former President Nelson Mandela wrote:


  I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista
  that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come.  But  I  can
  rest only for a moment, for with freedom comes  responsibilities,  and  I
  dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.

He was speaking for himself, from his experiences and the long road that  he
had walked, and yet he was speaking to all South Africans on the  part  they
have taken in the long walk and on the challenges ahead and  the  path  they
still need to walk.

The South African Public Service Commission was formed as a continuation  of
that walk. It was formed as a strategy to deal with those challenges  facing
the Public Service in particular. I cannot begin to  stress  the  importance
of the role of the Public Service in South Africa. A  better  life  for  all
demands that we have a very  efficient,  effective  and  accountable  Public
Service.

Under apartheid, the South African Public Service was originally  structured
around the needs of a deeply racist and undemocratic state. To  correct  the
injustices of the past, in particular regarding the Public  Service  sector,
in former President Mandela's own words:


  We desire that the Public Service be  dedicated  to  serving  the  public
  good, that it should be sensitive to the needs of the citizenry and  that
  it should be composed in a  manner  that  reflects  the  make-up  of  our
  society.

Following South Africa's transition to democracy,  transforming  the  Public
Service became a priority. The reality is that the Public  Service  in  some
provinces  continues  to  reflect  our  apartheid  past.  The   pursuit   of
nonracialism and nonsexism demands that it  should  be  changed.  Therefore,
the Public Service Commission was formed most importantly to  redress  those
imbalances  of  the  past.  The  tasks  of  the  Public  Service  Commission
therefore  include  promoting  a  high  standard  of  professional   ethics,
efficient, economic and  effective  use  of  resources  and  a  development-
oriented  public   administration.   These   services   must   be   provided
impartially, fairly, equitably and without  bias.  People's  needs  must  be
responded to and the public must be encouraged  to  participate  in  policy-
making.

Furthermore, the public administration must be accountable, there should  be
transparency, good  human  resource  management  should  be  cultivated  and
development practices should  be  encouraged  for  a  representative  public
administration with employment and personnel management practices  based  on
ability, objectivity and fairness,  a  very  challenging  but  not  hopeless
responsibility.  This  has  been  a  gradual  and  challenging  process  and
definitely not an easy one.

On that note I would like to congratulate the Public Service  Commission  on
the impressive work that they have done thus far. Through  the  adoption  of
the Batho Pele principles in the Public Service, the Government has  sent  a
clear signal to the  community  of  its  intention  to  improve  on  service
delivery.

The commission, through this programme, evaluates the service layout of  the
Public  Service  and  reports  on  its  findings.  It  aims  at   evaluating
compliance with the  Batho  Pele  principles  at  grass-roots-level  service
points,  obtaining  baseline  information  on  transforming  Public  Service
delivery, soliciting  views  on  constraints  and  problems  experienced  by
departments in implementing the White Paper and  making  recommendations  on
service delivery improvement.

In order to facilitate compliance with  the  Batho  Pele  White  Paper,  the
following have been proposed: building basic skills to apply the Batho  Pele
principles, the integration of the service  delivery  improvement  programme
with other management initiatives  in  the  departments,  the  alignment  of
service delivery capacity with the service delivery  improvement  programme,
the identification of the  service  delivery  improvement  gap  and  how  to
achieve the improvement to bridge the gaps.

In addition,  the  redesignation  of  business  processes  involved  in  the
services is envisaged, so that the application of the Batho Pele  principles
makes a difference to the day-to-day work of front-line  personnel  and  the
Batho Pele principles are integrated into the performance management  system
of the department.

Despite  the  welcome  reality  of  the  existence  of  our  democratic  and
nonracial Constitution, and despite our hopes and efforts, there  are  still
some problems, as the commission has observed in some of our provinces.  The
following  are  some  of  the  observations  made  by  the  Public   Service
Commission regarding the state of the Public Service nationally.

Firstly, combating corruption remains a major challenge currently  addressed
by a number of different agencies. Secondly, public resources are still  not
used optimally. Thirdly, there is still no national  consensus  on  what  it
means to  have  a  development  orientation.  Fourthly,  inconsistencies  in
national development policies exacerbate this problem.  Fifthly,  monitoring
and evaluation remain a weak area in this regard, while there is a  need  to
take greater account of regional  dynamics  in  development  policy  and  in
implementation.  Sixthly,  patterns  of  inequality  remain  in   previously
disadvantaged areas and previously  disadvantaged  areas  remain  relatively
underserviced. Less use has  been  made  of  participatory  techniques  than
immediately  after  the  political  transition,  reflecting   an   increased
delivery.
A national standard of what constitutes an acceptable level of  consultation
still needs to be determined. The creation of a transparent  public  service
is a slow and painstaking process that can easily be subverted in the  haste
to achieve service delivery targets. Building mechanisms and  procedures  in
this area is an ongoing challenge and, despite the creation of an  excellent
policy framework, much still has to be done in the area of maximising  human
potential.

Promoting policies and ensuring the use of  performance  management  systems
are  of  concern  in  this   regard.   Intensive   labour   relations   have
characterised the system. While the Public Service has become  more  diverse
and representative in recent years, there are still certain areas  in  which
gains have been reversed and previously disadvantaged people continue to  be
marginalised. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION:  Chairperson,  thank
you for the opportunity to discuss the issues on the table. I  am  going  to
respond to some of the questions specifically, but will also deal with  some
of the issues more broadly.

I want to start out by reflecting a little bit on some of  the  issues  that
confront us in the restructuring of the Public Service as a whole and  which
have particular pertinence to the NCOP as well.  These  are  issues  that  I
believe we should grapple with. I am sure, Chairperson, you  will  allow  me
to respectfully engage some of the issues that have been raised by members.

What comes out and has come out quite clearly and repeatedly over  a  period
of time is that in order for it to be appropriately poised to  take  forward
service delivery on the scale and quality required,  there  is  a  need  for
major restructuring of the Public Service.

I would like to remind members of  this  Council  that  at  this  particular
point in time we are  involved  in  very  intensive  negotiations  with  our
labour partners. They start  today,  16  October,  and  continue  up  to  12
December. We are going to  develop  procedures,  frameworks  and  mechanisms
that will underpin the restructuring process.

It seems as though the NNP and the DA have just sorted out  their  conflict.
I see a number of smiles among those coming  into  the  room.  I  believe  a
response is no longer needed, because we have just dealt with the  chasm  at
a political level that could lead to greater accountability in terms of  the
executive legislative interface here today. Do I excuse myself and  ask  for
a report? [Interjections.] [Laughter.]

I see.

Up to  12  December  there  is  going  to  be  very  intense  engagement  on
restructuring. Members have raised the question in this Council  today:  Why
is there a need for that restructuring? We all appreciate the fact that,  if
we look at the current structure of the Public Service, it cannot  yet  meet
the service delivery needs as required.

As a matter of fact, I want to go back to the current profile of the  Public
Service. Let us look at some facts.  In  December  2000,  the  size  of  the
Public Service stood at just over one million public servants, 71%  of  whom
were in the provinces: the component that  hon  members  directly  interface
with in terms of their oversight function.

A third of public servants are in social services, 51% being women  and  49%
men. However, women make up only  about  20%  of  the  managerial  level  of
employees. Of that only 0,2% of employees are people with disabilities,  and
that is far short of the 2% target that we have set for ourselves.

Going further and looking at the management cadre  of  the  Public  Service,
the number remains alarmingly small.  Management  constitutes  0,4%  of  the
entire  Public  Service.  To  aggravate  the  situation  even  further,  the
distribution of senior managers  is  skewed  between  national  departments,
which are  more  policy-oriented,  and  provincial  departments,  which  are
closer to the actual service delivery.
I raise these issues because it is a reality that we  are  deeply  conscious
of. Hence there are particular interventions to deal with these  issues.  We
should not make it seem that changing the Public  Service  is  going  to  be
achieved by the waving of any wand. There is no magic about  it.  The  magic
may be in the actual doing and the understanding that  we  all  have  as  to
what should be done and the fact that it is going to  take  time  to  do  it
well.

I want to raise one issue that has come up. The hon member Botha strikes  me
as having - and I am going to use a term I used once  before  when  the  hon
member across the floor was too far away to lunge at  me  or  grab  me  -  a
sense of political schizophrenia. [Interjections.] I say this today  because
last week when I was here she interfaced on the wage negotiations in  a  way
which, compared to today, is as  if  she  is  talking  about  two  different
public services. It is as though today she has woken up  to  something  that
is very wrong and whatever.

Last week, if we go back to the Hansard, the input she made  was  a  massive
attack on this Government in that it is not taking into  account  the  needs
of public servants. Now she comes back and  says  the  issue  is  not  about
money. She is quoting, correctly so, a colleague of mine, but she  does  not
place it in a particular context. [Interjections]

What is being raised is not new. The issue is:  Do  we  have  the  political
will to do what is required, or are we in the  habit  of  being  politically
schizophrenic by playing to the gallery and deciding to run with the  hounds
and then to hunt with the wolves? If we do that, we are not and do not  have
the ability to give the required direction, and to take the long haul.

Let me talk about some of these issues. Yes, indeed, this is not  all  about
money. It is also about resources, human resources. What investment  are  we
making in the Public Service to make  the  changes?  We  put  in  place  the
senior management service, effected in January this year. We are  10  months
into that process.
I want to beg to differ  with  a  member  who  also  raised  the  issue  of,
probably, salaries not being  good  enough  and  perhaps  not  incentivising
people to be in the Public Service. I think  it's  hon  Nyakane  who  raised
this particular  issue.  I  beg  to  differ.  If  he  looks  at  the  senior
management service, he will see that we  looked  at  a  package  that  would
assist us both to recruit a  particular  type  of  person  into  the  Public
Service and retain that person.

We also felt and are working on the development  angle  of  that,  which  is
that of looking at ensuring that  we  have  a  programme  that  is  actually
supportive of all levels of public servants. Let us look at  the  management
cadre itself, at supporting the management cadre. Hence, we have  the  whole
programme of leadership. We have a programme in which Samdi is  involved  in
the upgrading, skilling and  training  of  senior  managers  in  the  Public
Service through the Presidential Lead Projects  of  the  Reconstruction  and
Development Programme, PLSDP. I may have missed a letter  there,  but  I  am
sure Samdi will excuse me in that instance. We need a bit more,  because  we
realise, very clearly, that in  certain  areas  our  salaries  will  not  be
competitive with the private sector.

Let us look at the  Treasury,  for  example.  The  director-general  of  the
Treasury will not be retained through  a  management  package,  because  she
will be able to get that kind of package - three times that  amount  if  not
more - as her counterpart would  in  the  UK  treasury.  But  hers  also,  I
believe, goes with the whole calling that says, ``I am proud to be a  public
servant.'' I believe she will see it as part of her national service, so  to
speak, as a good patriot whilst, at the same time,  acquiring  the  kind  of
experience that will  open  doors  for  her  anywhere  at  any  point,  both
nationally and internationally, if she were to leave this particular area.

That is what we are also trying to develop in the Public Service - pride  in
being a public servant. That is why the  Batho  Pele  project  should  work.
However, again, this is not an event; it is not a  narrow  campaign.  It  is
about the process. We are trying to do a few things  about  the  Batho  Pele
campaign. What we are trying to do is to ensure that we  are  able  to  make
the Public Service more accessible and, hence, we are  still  working  on  a
directory that will give members of  the  public  easy  access  as  to  what
services are available.

Through Batho Pele week we tried to ensure that we opened offices  to  allow
people to look at the work processes  in  offices.  We  also  started  doing
something in addition to that. We said that where  problems  are  identified
we do not just want to stand on a soapbox and  appear  holier-than-thou  and
beat our breasts and say, ``This is wrong. This is bad, and it is worse.''

We also want to ensure that  there  are  interventions  that  actually  take
things forward. What and how are these interventions to take place? We  want
senior managers in teams to go into institutions that have  been  identified
as having problems, and not to go in as the chiefs, but to be  part  of  the
team. They go in there  to  work  under  the  supervisor,  in  a  particular
institution, and help to improve the work processes.

We believe that as we are also  involved  in  an  oversight  role,  we  also
account  for  what  happens.  I  do  not  believe  that  the  country  wants
pessimistic communication  all  the  time  in  that  we  say  that  we  have
identified the problem. Here is the Public Service Commission report on  the
Batho  Pele  review  that  has  been  done.  There  are  50,  100  or  3¬†000
recommendations. But we harp on about recommendations and we do not  do  the
doing. We want to do more of the doing. As the saying goes which,  I  think,
is a Yugoslavian saying, it is easy for those to  talk  who  have  not  been
involved in the actual practice of doing. I think it  goes  something  along
those lines. I shared this at the beginning of the year  with  the  national
Parliament.

We want to be able to ensure that national Government and  the  managers  in
national Government  should  not  just  be  seen  as  developing  regulatory
frameworks, but should actually be seen working with those at  the  coalface
to ensure that they see the effecting of those frameworks.

Let me take this a bit further and say that a further issue and  point  that
we want to make, coming back to the whole issue of what  kind  of  framework
is required,  is  that  we  are  reviewing  regulations  to  ensure  greater
mobility of public servants across the spheres of government.

Again, as one listened to the input earlier today,  I  could  not  help  but
wonder whether some of the questions that I threw out in the beginning  were
actually heard, because when I  spoke  about  seamless  government,  I  also
reflected it as a complex  issue.  I  reflected  on  the  complexity  around
accountability frameworks. This is also about  the  complexity  of  ensuring
service delivery in a different way. This is not going to happen  overnight,
I would like to say to hon Botha. I think, if we are going to imagine it  is
going to happen overnight, then we  are  creating  a  false  impression  for
ourselves and for the broader public out there.

However, I want to align myself with the view that we do not expect  endless
patience by the public. It is correct for the public  to  insist  on  better
service delivery, both in terms of quality and scale. However,  we  need  to
ensure that at the level of the  National  Council  of  Provinces  we  check
whether the mechanisms that have been identified to be  effected  have  been
effected at the provincial  and  local  levels.  This  is  because  as  from
January this year as well, performance accountability  has  been  integrated
in a more practical way. I see up there in  the  gallery  a  member  of  the
Public Service Commission,  a  member  who  represents  this  province.  The
commission itself is playing a role in  the  evaluation  of  the  directors-
general of departments at national level and at provincial level.

The reason that this evaluation is so critical is to ensure  that  there  is
accountability down the line for what needs to be done.  This is so  that  a
DG knows - I once referred to it very  flippantly  and  I  will  share  that
comment in a very anecdotal way - that when Fraser-Moleketi walks  in,  they
should not say, ``I am not going to have  my  performance  evaluated  today,
because she has a mauve suit on. That is a bad sign. I  must  wait  for  the
day she has a red suit on, because then she will say yes and I will get  the
percentage increase I want.'' [Laughter.] There is a process  on  the  table
which has a panel and a mechanism that  actually  does  a  review,  even  by
colleagues, of the work of the head of the department  or  director-general.
That process looks at performance accountability and accountability  to  the
executing authority, but hon members need  accountability  for  the  service
delivery in the field.

Regarding the issue of Batho Pele, we must  also  ensure  that,  as  we  are
looking at our oversight role, we are not just using the stick but also  the
developmental interventions required. During the Batho  Pele  week,  members
of the Portfolio Committee on Public  Service  and  Administration  went  to
various centres in the Western Cape. They  went  to  clinics,  Home  Affairs
offices, hospitals, etc, where they found various  problems.  They  went  to
one  queue  outside  the  hospital's  medical  dispensary.  They  could  not
understand why the queue was taking so long. And  they  realised  that  they
did not require a rocket scientist to effect some  changes  to  the  system.
They gave some words of advice and the queue moved faster.

How many legislators go out there to see what  needs  to  be  done  and  are
willing to come back and tell the Minister or  MEC  where  they  encountered
problems and say that those problems could be  easily  resolved  if  certain
things were done differently in  terms  of  the  system  that  is  operating
there? These are some of the issues that need to be dealt  with  and  it  is
not just about opportunistic political schizophrenia  at  given  moments.  I
think that there is a lot more that one can talk about.

I would like to appeal to members by saying: Let us look  carefully  at  the
roles that we play. Let us look critically at the extent to  which  we  look
at the PFMA as an instrument that can be used in terms of  facilitating  the
oversight. And, as we look at and use that instrument, we  can  also  define
our role as legislators in giving it effect.

Regarding the hon member Bhengu - I cannot see him now. He has  disappeared.
Therefore, I cannot ask the question now. I will  have  to  ask  it  in  his
presence, otherwise he may raise the issue again in future.

Let me conclude by stating a reminder and an emphasis on  a  matter  that  I
think relates to oversight and that should be central to  the  hon  members.
Hon members deal with the places where the bulk of the public servants  are.
They are the representatives of the provinces. The current  package  on  the
conditions of service - and I repeat what I said  -  that  is  going  to  be
negotiated deals with some of the  fundamental  issues  that  are  going  to
contribute to the better functioning of  the  Public  Service.  Hon  members
need to follow that.

Restructuring, I want to repeat, is important. It is not to  be  done  at  a
distance and then one simply wants to hear about it when there is  a  crisis
or otherwise. Hon members need to familiarise themselves  with  its  details
and look at what the needs are in order  to  improve  the  service  delivery
because, as I said before, amalgamating the Public Service into one  was  no
mean feat, but it was not the be-all and end-all. There is a lot  else  that
goes with it.

A second aspect that is in that agreement is the issue of  scarce  skills  -
that  is,  the  fact  that  we  need   to   retain   appropriately   skilled
professionals in the Public Service. Hence, we moved away  and  set  up  the
issue of the senior management service to move away  from  the  notion  that
any  professional  who  moves  up  in   the   Public   Service   needs   to,
automatically, become a manager. Not all of us are good  managers.  Some  of
us need and want to remain in a specific profession in order to  serve  this
country with pride. We need to have the opportunity to do that.  The  senior
management service provides that opportunity. Hon  members  should  look  at
and familiarise themselves with it and ensure that it is being effected  and
implemented correctly in the provinces.

The last thing that I should say is, and I have said it  once  before,  that
it is not only one piece of wood that keeps the fire burning, it takes  many
pieces. It also requires a good person to make the fire. My grandfather  was
a woodcutter. Hy was 'n houtkapper. Using wood as fuel was also central  for
the income of that family. I raised that because I  believe  that,  in  that
vein, accountability is a powerful tool in  the  hands  of  the  people  and
their institutions. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! That  concludes
the discussion. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the  Minister
for engaging this House on this lively debate. I hope that this matter  will
be taken further.

                NATIONAL TRANSPORT TRANSITION AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson, members of the NCOP,  delegates,  my
colleague the MEC for transport in the Western Cape, Mr Piet  Meyer  and  my
friends, the National Land Transport Transition Act, Act  22  of  2000,  was
brought into  operation  on  1  December  2000.  Those  parts  dealing  with
transport planning were, however, not brought  into  effect.  This  decision
was taken against the background that the three spheres of  government  were
not ready to implement the requirements of the Act.

Planning is the cornerstone of this law and a question could be raised:  Why
could Government not delay the promulgation until all those  concerned  were
ready for implementation? It will be recalled that the taxi industry was  in
chaos during last year and that there was a desperate need to formalise  and
legalise this industry. In order for us to do this in a  proper  manner,  it
was required that this legislation be brought into effect.

My department together with the provinces - and I am happy  to  report  that
the co-operation between national and provincial departments is very good  -
launched the Be Legal campaign in June this year with the  specific  aim  of
addressing the formalisation and legalisation of the taxi industry.
I am pleased to report  today  that  most  of  the  illegal  operators  have
already applied for legalisation. That is the information  I  got  from  the
provinces. The proposed amendments before this House will have an impact  on
this process. I have agreed with the nine provincial MECs of transport  that
the closing date for adjudication of the applications  for  legalisation  be
extended to April 2002. It should be noted  that  this  extension  will  not
reopen applications but will give provinces  ample  time  to  finalise  this
process and issue operating licences to those operators  who  have  met  the
set criteria.

The proposed amendments before  the  House  today  are  required  to  assist
provinces  to  appoint  the  operating  licensing  boards  or  to  authorise
provincial  permit  boards  to  deal  with  these  applications  within  the
framework of the National Land Transport Transition Act.

Furthermore, I would like to report to the House that, for  the  first  time
in  the  history  of  this  country,  the  taxi  industry  has  a   national
democratically elected representative body or leadership. This was  achieved
by my department  and  the  provinces  by  embarking  on  a  democratisation
process for the industry. There were many processes involved  in  this,  and
these processes culminated in the National Taxi Conference  in  Durban  from
14 to 16 September when the SA National Taxi Council, Santaco,  was  formed.
Hon members will recall that the previous body was known as Sataco,  the  SA
Taxi Council. So the new body is known as  Santaco,  the  SA  National  Taxi
Council.

In this regard I would like  to  express  my  sincere  appreciation  to  Rev
Farisani, who is  the  MEC  for  transport  in  the  Northern  Province.  He
successfully steered this process to finality on my behalf. Incidentally,  I
should indicate that Ms Majodina, chairperson of  the  Select  Committee  on
Public Services, also attended the conference and played an  important  role
in keeping the delegates and conference together. I want to  thank  her  for
the role which she played. [Applause.]

I must also say that I enjoyed the full co-operation of all the MECs  -  all
my colleagues from  the  provinces  for  transport.  I  want  to  record  my
appreciation to them as well. The MEC for the Western Cape is here,  and  he
attended the conference and was at my side all the time.  I  want  to  thank
him for that.

I now want to turn to the question of planning.  The  planning  sections  of
this Act, which are very  important,  did  not  come  into  operation  on  1
December 2000 as the rest of the  Act  did,  owing  to  various  preparatory
actions that need to take place. Although everybody accepts  the  importance
of integrated transport planning  as  well  as  the  linkage  to  integrated
development plans, various constraints, ranging from  funding  to  capacity,
hampered the ability of all spheres of government to prepare  the  necessary
plans.

At  the  time  of  promulgation,  the  department  was  in  the  process  of
finalising the planning guidelines. We are now busy with the preparation  of
the planning regulations. These guidelines  were  prepared  in  consultation
with all role-players, but specifically with provincial  and  local  spheres
of government. It is envisaged that these regulations will be published  for
public comment by February 2002.

Talking about the constraints to which I have referred will not address  the
problems. Therefore I have decided on the following approach, which  I  hope
will win the approval of this House. Firstly, planning will  be  dealt  with
on a case-by-case basis. No attempt will be made to bludgeon  provinces  all
to comply at the same time. So they will be dealt  with  on  a  case-by-case
basis, based on  agreements  between  me  as  Minister  and  the  provincial
ministers  of  transport.  Secondly,  I  have  requested  the  Committee  of
Transport Officials, Coto, which consists of the 10 heads of departments  of
transport, to develop a programme of capacity-building  in  all  spheres  of
government. Thirdly, as the bulk of plans required by the Act will  have  to
be  produced  by  the  local  spheres  of  government,  the  Department   of
Provincial and Local Government and my department are busy  developing  ways
and means to ensure a common approach to transport planning. Lastly, I  will
approach foreign countries - we do have some countries with  which  we  have
agreements of co-operation - to assist in achieving the  goals  we  set  for
ourselves in this regard.

Even though the planning sections of the  Act  are  not  yet  in  operation,
there is still the need for subsidised bus services to continue serving  the
community at large, and for Government to transform the bus  contracts  from
the interim contracts to subsidised services and negotiated contracts,  thus
creating opportunities for the historically  disadvantaged  and  for  small,
medium and micro enterprises, SMMEs, who are in the bus industry.

Since the introduction of these contracts, I can say that approximately  10%
of all subsidised bus services are provided by  SMMEs.  These  services  are
operated with 414 buses and most of these operators, 57 in  total,  are  new
entrants to the market, which is a significant achievement for our  country.
The move away from lifelong permits to contracts  is  necessary  to  address
the legacy of the past and to ensure that the needs of the  communities  are
adequately met.

The Act, however, requires the  new  contracts  to  be  based  on  transport
plans. Compliance with this provision is the ideal, but, as already  stated,
it cannot be achieved in the short term. Because of this  and  also  because
we cannot allow subsidised bus services to be  jeopardised,  we  have  asked
for this  amendment  before  the  House  today.  The  amendment  will  allow
contracts to be concluded even though, at this  stage,  no  transport  plans
are in place.

I would also like to touch on our involvement in the priorities set  by  the
President in respect of the Integrated Rural Development and  Urban  Renewal
Strategies. Transport is an enabler; it is a facilitator. It is  a  catalyst
in achieving economic and social development. Without transport, many  other
activities in different  areas  will  suffer.  So  transport  plays  a  very
important role.

Last year my department ran rural  access  projects  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  the
Eastern Cape and the Northern Province. We also developed  a  guide  to  co-
ordinated transport, nodal  and  linkage  development,  which  serves  as  a
platform  to  ensure  that  the  full  spectrum  of  transport  matters  are
addressed in an integrated manner. The outcome of  these  projects  will  be
utilised to extend integrated transport planning to all rural areas  in  our
country. We are very determined to ensure that we participate  maximally  in
the Integrated and Sustainable Rural Development Strategy, as enunciated  by
the President.

We are also  involved  in  urban  areas,  and  various  projects  have  been
identified, which impact directly on the identified  urban  nodes.  Many  of
these projects have been ongoing  since  1999.  We  have  already  seen  the
benefits of the development of urban corridors. I would,  however,  like  to
highlight our project of extending the commuter rail  line  in  Khayelitsha.
We are struggling very hard to get this done. The problem  has  always  been
getting adequate finances, and we hope that our dream in  this  regard  will
be realised. The extension of this  Khayelitsha  rail  line  will  not  only
provide affordable transport to thousands  of  our  people,  but  will  also
assist in the improved utilisation of existing infrastructure. As I  say,  I
hope that we will get the necessary support for this.

My department is currently also in discussion with the Gauteng province  and
with the Johannesburg Unicity to determine what contribution  transport  can
make in the revitalisation of Alexandra.

May I conclude by saying that although I have already mentioned the  reasons
for the proposed amendments, I need to stress the importance  of  proceeding
with the transformation of the bus and  taxi  industries.  Even  though  the
necessary planning is in the short term not in place, I  want  to  reiterate
my commitment to integrated planning. We  are  not  going  to  forget  about
planning or the work necessary to ensure that plans, according  to  the  Act
will be ready or that work is continuing. We will, in due  course,  be  able
to come up with the plans. This is only an interim measure  to  ensure  that
the momentum is maintained.

I would like to thank the Chair, all members  of  the  Select  Committee  on
Public Services, my colleagues, the legislatures and everyone in this  House
for  continual  guidance  and  support  in  all  efforts  undertaken  by  my
department and me in addressing the needs of our people. [Applause.]

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, hon Minister  and  hon  members,  when  we  first
embarked upon the process of transforming land  transportation  through  the
National Land Transport Transition Bill last year, we knew  that  we  had  a
unique Bill, especially  given  the  enormous  challenges  that  faced  this
particular industry.

All of us who were involved in the formulation and eventual passage of  this
Act knew that those sectors that were allowed to operate with little  or  no
norms and standards or guidelines would take some  time  before  they  would
adhere to the new policy shift. It was precisely  because  of  the  peculiar
dynamics  involved  in  this  industry  that  the  National  Land  Transport
Transition Act took the phased-in approach.

We also knew that because of the scope and magnitude of the  Bill  we  would
undergo various teething problems. What this amending Bill before  us  today
represents, therefore, are some of the concerns that were raised during  the
implementation process of the National Land  Transport  Transition  Act.  It
represents, too, a means of closing some of the loopholes in  the  Act  that
were not immediately apparent and it takes on board other  ideas  that  were
inadvertently overlooked.

But, most importantly, what these amendments seek to do is to recognise  and
give due consideration to the role that  the  provincial  government  should
play and the role that the new local government  authority  should  play  in
the land transport industry.  The  Bill  recognises  that  there  are  three
independent spheres of government that must be given due  recognition.  They
must find ways to speak to each other if the implementation of this Bill  is
to be successful.

Co-operative  governance   and   sound   intergovernmental   relations   are
demonstrated  by,  amongst  other  things,  this  Bill's  extension  of  the
definition of ``planning authority''. The Bill could even be  considered  to
be lenient in allowing  local  authorities  and  local  road  transportation
boards to continue to have the powers  and  functions  that  they  enjoy  up
until such time as both the Minister and MEC deem appropriate. At  the  same
time, this Bill cautions provinces to act as speedily  as  possible  in  the
submission of  transport  plans,  which  will  help  establish  a  permanent
arrangement for local and provincial transport.

Besides recognising the interrelated roles of  all  spheres  of  government,
this amending Bill highlights  the  need  for  all  role-players,  including
civil society, involved in land  transportation,  to  carefully  co-ordinate
the planning of their projects and programmes into one cohesive,  integrated
planning unit, so  that,  ultimately,  the  public  can  be  ensured  of  an
efficient and safe transportation system.

Because of the nature of the National Council of Provinces,  we  are  always
sensitive to the fact that provincial interests and needs have  to  be  well
represented and observed. We congratulate the Minister on  recognising  that
MECs should have a more hands-on approach to the appointment  of  provincial
operating licensing board members. We take  very  seriously  our  monitoring
and oversight functions, and we are pleased to  see  that  this  Bill  comes
with ready-made oversight and monitoring entities in the form of  the  board
and the MEC. We, in this Council, especially after our  experiences  in  the
Eastern  Cape,  are  also  hypersensitive  to  corrupt  practices  that  may
inadvertently or  directly  creep  into  all  our  good  intentions.  So  we
wholeheartedly endorse the inclusion of the MEC,  whose  role,  we  believe,
will greatly reduce potential corrupt practices.

This committee therefore endorses the Bill. [Applause.]
Mr  N  M  RAJU:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  special  delegates   and
colleagues, proposals to amend the National Land  Transport  Transition  Act
of 2000 make provision for subsidised service  contracts  to  be  concluded,
notwithstanding the absence of transport plans.  The  amendment  to  section
134 of the principal Act makes it possible for authorities to continue  with
their transport operations, even though proper transport plans may not  have
been finished.

It is generally accepted  that  especially  in  metropolitan  areas,  proper
transport plans help  provide  integrated  approaches  to  providing  proper
services. Normally there  are  numerous  operators  in  metropolitan  areas.
Without transport plans, how do we rationalise services in a  cost-effective
and structured manner? Surely the ad hoc approach will impact  adversely  on
an integrated approach in which other modes of transport  may  be  involved?
We ask: Why is the Act silent on the provision of  interim  transport  plans
until such time as the relevant authorities are  in  a  position  to  design
transport plans for their areas of jurisdiction?
What, in effect, this amendment means is that tenders will be determined  on
an arbitrary basis. Allowing authorities to initiate the tender process  for
routes, without any of the formalities prescribed in section 47 having  been
complied with, poses some difficulty. We  understand  that  the  contracting
authority, core city or municipality may proceed with the  relevant  matter,
with the approval of the relevant MEC, in consultation with the Minister.

It must not be forgotten that  the  principal  Act,  Act  22  of  2000,  was
specifically designed to establish a holistic  public  transport  policy  to
ensure that the commuting public have access to a properly co-ordinated  and
functioning  transport  system.  Are  we  now  setting  aside  the   guiding
principles set out in section 4 of Act 22  of  2000,  which  emphasises  co-
ordination, efficiency and  planning?  It  is  my  party's  contention  that
nothing should be done to the detriment of the commuting public.

However, let me hasten to assure the Minister that the DP, as a  responsible
component of the opposition Democratic Alliance, will  not  be  a  stumbling
block  to  progressive  legislation,  even  though  we  have  some   serious
concerns, as delineated above. [Interjections.] We realise that  there  will
be serious repercussions and even disruptions  should  section  134  not  be
amended. We certainly do not want to be seen as blocking the  transformation
of the transport industry.

We  support  the  National  Land  Transport   Transition   Amendment   Bill.
[Applause.]

Ms L F SHABALALA (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson and hon Minister, allow me  to
make this comment first, as  the  representative  from  KwaZulu-Natal.  Last
week we were privileged to be empowered by the briefing that was made by  Mr
Bassetti from Acsa about the opportunities, challenges and  threats  in  the
construction of King Shaka Airport in KwaZulu-Natal. To  my  disappointment,
the journalist who was present at that  meeting  chose  to  misconstrue  the
facts by writing a  negative  perspective,  which  was  never  given  by  Mr
Bassetti. We will take the responsibility, as representatives from  KwaZulu-
Natal, to correct this perspective in our legislature.

I appreciate the fact that  the  Bill  itself  and  the  amendments  thereto
intend to  advance  and  consolidate  our  transformation.  We  engaged  the
stakeholders in our public hearings to re-emphasise the  point  that  people
shall govern. Our apartheid past, which we  should  recognise  in  order  to
build the future,  was  characterised  by  separate  development,  legalised
through the Group Areas Act, the mother of all evils,  like  taxi  violence,
poverty and class division.  The  apartheid  economic  policies  meant  that
African blacks, as the majority, were organised into the commuter groups  of
society. The distance from  work  and  towns  organised  us  into  the  taxi
industry,  which  was  later  to  be  deregulated   in   order   to   create
destabilisation.

The  process  of  regulating  and   democratising   the   industry   through
registration and recapitalisation is  nothing  but  the  correction  of  the
past. Therefore, we  appreciate  the  promotion  of  public  transport  over
private transport. The national taxi conference in  Durban  was  a  historic
advancement in democracy, especially because it took place in  the  province
of KwaZulu-Natal.

As far as  public  participation  is  concerned,  I  am  not  sure  how  the
transport  boards  were  constituted  in  the  past,  but  through  the  ANC
Government transparency is the principle.  The  mere  fact  that  the  board
members will be nominated by the  communities  from  the  communities  means
that the revolution is on the right track.  The  fact  that  the  amendments
direct that there be a chairperson of the board, will  mean,  I  hope,  that
the gender policy will be considered in that  process.  Even  in  the  music
world, boys' choirs are being phased out.

As the Bill provides for nonmembers, it  is  indeed  a  challenge  that  our
transport operators organise and unite towards a collective voice, so as  to
benefit from the recapitalisation process.

I would like to tell the hon the Minister that in this  country  we  have  a
standard set of road signs, but our  motorists  have  created  new  sets  of
their own sign languages. As one of the readers of the Mercury from KwaZulu-
Natal wrote on 3 September 2001:


  One finger, one thumb means keep moving we will all be happy and gay,  as
  he wrongly interpreted the sign made by the driver of  the  passing  car.
  When he asked his kids what the sign meant, they told him that it was the
  Hawaiian good luck sign. When the other motorist appreciated  the  bumper
  sticker on his car, which was praising the Lord, he in return gave them a
  big smile and held up a middle finger as a good luck sign.

This is an illustration  of  how  road  rage  starts,  from  sign  language,
developing into physical confrontation. I  am  aware  of  how  the  hon  the
Minister feels towards this intolerance on  the  road.  However,  we  cannot
legislate emotions, except to plead for  tolerance  amongst  all  of  us  as
motorists.
We appreciate the fact that the hon the Minister  and  the  department  took
time  to  take  us  through  this  amending  Bill.  From  KwaZulu-Natal   we
appreciate and support the amendments. [Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Geagte Voorsitter, geagte Minister. Op 13 April 2000  het  ons
in  hierdie  Huis  die  belangrikheid  van  die  National   Land   Transport
Transitional Bill bespreek wat dit ten doel gestel het  om  'n  fundamentele
transformasie  en  integrasie  in  die  padvervoerwette  van  ons  land   te
bewerkstellig. Partye het voortgegaan met  hierdie  doelstelling  omdat  ons
glo dat indien regulering in die totale padvervoerstelsel,  maar  veral  van
die taxibedryf daarin kan slaag om orde te skep uit die  chaos  wat  in  die
bedryf geheers het, kan dit alleen tot voordeel van die gemeenskap wees.

Die Nuwe NP het vir hierdie rede in beginsel die wet  ondersteun,  maar  het
ook  uitgewys  dat  daar  onses  insiens  ernstige  tekortkominge   in   die
wetsontwerp was en wat aangespreek moes word,  voordat  hierdie  tussentydse
wet as 'n volwaardige wet ge√Ømplementeer kon word. Dit het  nie  gebeur  nie
en die wet kon gevolglik nie behoorlik ge√Ømplementeer word nie.

Hier  sit  ons  vandag  meer  as  'n  jaar  en  'n   half   later   met   'n
wysigingswetsontwerp wat 'n hele rits amendemente voorstel. Dit is 'n  bewys
dat die oorspronklike wetsontwerp nie weldeurdag was  nie  en  dat  van  die
tekortkominge wat ons uitgewys het, nou die oorsaak is dat die  wet  gewysig
moet word. Die Nuwe NP steun ook hierdie wysigings in  beginsel,  omdat  ons
glo dat doeltreffende vervoer van mense en  goedere  'n  basiese  voorwaarde
vir gesonde ekonomiese en sosiale ontwikkeling in Suid-Afrika  is.  Ons  glo
egter dat strategiese beplanning nodig is vir effektiewe regulering.

In essensie is die hoofdoel van  hierdie  oorspronklike  wetgewing  dan  ook
juis om die totale vervoerstelsel en veral di√© van ...  Veral  di√©  van  die
taxibedryf. U moet my verskoon. Ek dink dis hierdie bankmaat van my  wat  my
papiere deurmekaar gemaak het. [Gelag.] [Tussenwerpsels.] Wat op die  papier
wat weg is, staan is dat juis dit wat in die oorspronklike  wet  staan,  nou
ongedaan gemaak word as gevolg van die beplanning  wat  nie  nodig  is  nie,
voordat daar aansoek gedoen word vir lisensies.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans

[Dr P J C NEL: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister. On 13 April 2000 we  discussed
in this House the importance of the National Land Transport Transition  Bill
which had as its objective  to  achieve  a  fundamental  transformation  and
integration in the road transport Acts of  our  country.  Parties  proceeded
with this objective because we believed that  if  regulation  in  the  total
road transport system, but particularly in the taxi industry, could  succeed
in creating order out of the chaos  which  prevailed  in  the  industry,  it
could only be to the benefit of the community.

The New NP supported the Act in principle for this reason, but also  pointed
out that in our opinion there were serious  shortcomings  in  the  Bill  and
that  these  had  to  be  addressed,  before  this  interim  Act  could   be
implemented as a fully fledged Act. This did not happen and  the  Act  could
consequently not be properly implemented.
Here we sit today, more than a year and a half later, with an amending  Bill
which proposes a string of amendments. This is proof that the  original  Act
was not well thought out and that the shortcomings which we pointed out  are
now the reason that the Act must be amended. The New NP also supports  these
amendments in principle, because we believe  that  efficient  transportation
of people and goods is a basic  condition  for  sound  economic  and  social
development in South Africa. However, we believe that strategic planning  is
necessary for effective regulation.

In essence the primary objective of this original legislation is  then  also
precisely, with regard to the total transport system and  particularly  that
of ... Particularly that of the taxi industry. You must excuse me.  I  think
it's this bench mate of  mine  who  has  mixed  up  my  papers.  [Laughter.]
[Interjections.] What  appears  on  the  paper  that  is  missing,  is  that
precisely that which appeared in the original  Act  is  being  undone  as  a
result of the unnecessary planning, before licences are applied for.]
The preparing of national transport strategic  frameworks  by  the  hon  the
Minister of Transport is very important. These sections  in  schedule  7  of
the Bill also make provision for the preparation of current public  records,
rationalisation plans and public integrated plans.

The transport plans, inter alia, were supposed to protect the  interests  of
both the existing operators and the users by ensuring that  there  would  be
an objective basis for identifying the routes or route networks  to  be  put
to tender. The amendments, effectively, now remove the  need  for  transport
plans and enable the tenders to be  determined  on  a  completely  arbitrary
basis.

The  widening  of  the  definition  of  the  transport  authority  puts  the
responsibility for drawing up  public  and  integrated  transport  plans  on
authorities that, at present, might lack  the  capacity  and  the  technical
competence to do so.

Ten slotte wil ek my teleurstelling uitspreek oor die prosedure  wat  gevolg
is by die hantering van die wetsontwerp in die gekose  komitee.  Skriftelike
voorleggings  en  voorstelle  vir  wysigings  is   gemaak   deur   van   die
belangrikste rolspelers in die  bedryf,  soos  byvoorbeeld  SABOA,  wat  die
operateurs verteenwoordig wat ongeveer 12  000  busse  in  ons  land  besit,
asook ander instansies. Daar was ook versoeke van hulle kant om die  komitee
toe te spreek.

Al wat gebeur het, is dat SABOA toegelaat is om 'n  waarnemer  te  stuur  na
die drie sittings van die komitee, maar is nie toegelaat om die komitee  toe
te spreek  nie.  Geeneen  van  die  voorstelle  is  eers  voorgel√™  aan  die
regsadviseurs van die departement vir kommentaar  nie.  Van  die  voorstelle
was relevant en mens kan maar net hoop dat die  portefeuljekomitee  van  die
NV hulle wel 'n kans sal gee om gehoor te word.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[In conclusion I want to  express  my  disappointment  about  the  procedure
followed in the handling of  the  Bill  in  the  select  committee.  Written
submissions and proposals for amendments were  made  by  some  of  the  most
important role-players in the industry, such as  SABOA  for  example,  which
represents the operators who own approximately 12 000 buses in our  country,
as well as other institutions. There were also requests  on  their  part  to
address the committee.

All that happened was that SABOA was allowed to  send  an  observer  to  the
three sittings of the committee, but they were not allowed  to  address  the
committee. None of the proposals was even submitted to  the  legal  advisers
of the department for commentary. Some of the proposals  were  relevant  and
one can only hope that the portfolio committee of the NA will  give  them  a
chance to be heard.]

Mr P P DYONASE (North West): Chairperson, hon Minister of Transport,  it  is
unfortunate that I am from the North West because we do  not  have  it.  The
spirit that prevailed at the taxi conference held in Durban left us  with  a
big hope that the industry would take the  right  direction.  Fortunately  I
was there, but the excuses made by individuals accusing  the  MECs  for  not
consulting them were totally unacceptable. The  word  ``consultation''  must
not be used to derail this process.

I know where I am coming from in  North  West.  Extensive  consultation  has
been done but one will always get those individuals who say that  they  were
not consulted. They do not fit into the present system. In  the  North  West
about 57 taxi associations have not yet registered. One  asks  oneself  what
the problem might be. They will tell one that they are thinking about it.

We have many women who are committed to peace  in  those  associations,  but
they are led by the radicals. The industry is  full  of  the  blood  of  the
commuters and it can kill its own members. I have a picture in  my  mind  of
the delegation from the Eastern Cape. They were  contributing  to  peace  in
this industry. They were massacred when they came back from the  conference.
It simply says that there are those  individuals  who  are  still  resisting
this process. We will not stop this process and it will continue.

With this legislation, the Minister has the full support of the  North  West
and everybody must support it. When we get out of this old process  in  this
industry, we are saying to the Minister that as much as we  are  having  all
these problems, this transformation must continue and nobody  will  hold  it
back, even those individuals who will be cast out and who need to  transform
themselves. Let us continue to support it and give it our total  assistance.
Let us establish who the owners or the masters of this industry  are.  Thank
you, Chairperson,  for  giving  us  as  provinces  the  chance  to  comment.
[Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon Minister of  Transport,  hon  members  of
the NCOP, the Bill on the Table is a very important tool for bringing  peace
and stability in the famous taxi industry. It is famous  because  it  caters
for a population of almost 60% of daily commuters countrywide.  It  is  also
very pathetic that many families have lost their loved ones in this  popular
and widely used industry across the country.

The sporadic eruption of violence brings chaos and misery to most  civilians
who depend on the taxi as a means of transport.  Children  and  adults  have
died and have been accidentally caught up in shooting  episodes.  Many  taxi
drivers have been killed in faction fights in this industry. We in  the  IFP
express our deepest sympathy  to  all  the  families  and  victims  of  taxi
violence. We say that enough is enough.

In the past two weeks six people from Qunu in the Eastern  Cape  lost  their
lives after having attended  the  important  meeting  in  Durban  which  was
convened by the Minister of Transport. In his efforts  to  bring  peace  and
stability in the taxi industry, the  President  in  his  speech  during  the
funeral of these victims mentioned:


  This taxi violence is unnecessary and must come to an end.

We  commend  the  work  of  the  Department  of  Safety  and  Security   for
apprehending  the  culprits  concerned  with  these   unnecessary   gruesome
killings of innocent people. The law  must  take  its  course  for  all  the
culprits. It is high time now that people learnt to live and let live.

Kuyadabukisa kakhulu  ukubona  kukhona  izinxushunxushu  nokungabekezelelani
kulo msebenzi omkhulu kangaka wosomatekisi.

Siyathokoza   impela   ukubona   umhlonishwa    uNgqongqoshe    wezokuThutha
esemizameni  yokuletha  ukuthula  kulolu  hwebo.  Abantu   bayaqedana   kulo
msebenzi,  kubangwa  abagibeli.  Ukungena  komthetho  kaHulumeni   ozolamula
kulolu hwebo kubaluleke kakhulu. Umphakathi  osebenzisa  amatekisi  uzozizwa
ukhuselekile futhi uvikelekile kulawo machaphazelo owatholayo uma kuliwa.

Abanye bayadubuleka bafe, kwesinye isikhathi inhlamvu  ishushuluza  iyoshaya
izingane noma abantu abangaqondene nalezi zimpi.  Sonke  siyazi  ukuthi  uma
izinto  zingahambi  kahle  kuye  kushaywe  umthetho  ukuze   izaphulamthetho
zithole ukujeziswa.

Siyethemba ukuthi kancane, kancane izinto  zizolunga.  Sithi  thina  be-IFP,
phambili ngomthetho  ozoqeda  udlame  ematekisini.  Impela  sithi  phambili!
[Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[It is disappointing to see violence and a lack  of  patience  in  the  taxi
industry. We are glad to see the  Minister  of  Transport  trying  to  bring
peace in this enterprise. People are killing one another in  this  business,
because they are competing for passengers. Now people  who  use  taxis  will
feel safe and protected from the pain they suffered when  taxi  people  were
fighting.

Some are shot dead, in other cases the bullet hits children  or  people  who
have nothing to do with that violence. We all know that if  things  are  not
going right, an Act should be passed so that the culprits  will  be  brought
to book.

We hope that little by little things will return to normal. We  in  the  IFP
say forward with the Act that is going to stop the taxi violence. We  indeed
say forward! [Applause.]]

Mr P MEYER (Western Cape): Chairperson, Minister of Transport the hon  Omar,
hon  members  most  of  us  are  aware  that  the  National  Land  Transport
Transition Act underwent a difficult process of writing and  rewriting  over
a period of approximately four years until it was  promulgated  and  finally
signed into effect by the President in December last year.

Although it was a very important and urgently needed  Act  during  the  last
phases of that exercise,  it  was  hurried  through  the  process  with  two
primary objectives in mind: firstly, to enable the  special  legislation  or
Be legal process to start and, secondly  to  allow  the  unbundling  of  the
monopoly-held bus contracts to proceed

However, certain  critical  portions  of  the  Act  were  not  brought  into
operation or were left out in error, resulting in the fact that  neither  of
these objectives could be lawfully concluded. Despite this  fact,  a  number
of my colleagues in  the  other  provinces  pressed  on  with  the  process,
unknowingly or as a result of pressure of circumstances.

In the Western Cape we could not allow that path because  of  very  specific
legal advice that  such  action  would  be  unlawful  and  contrary  to  the
principle  emphasised  by  the  Constitutional  Court  to  the  effect  that
Government had to operate within the law at all times.

The amending Bill before the House this afternoon attempts to ease the  path
in respect of the two objectives I mentioned earlier. I  find  myself  in  a
very difficult position in the knowledge that the Act still  contains  flaws
and omissions that need to be addressed urgently.

I have chosen the path of supporting its further passage, basically  because
it is imperative to conclude the Be Legal process. That is my one  and  only
motivation  at  this  stage,  since  it  is  essential   for   the   further
transformation of the taxi  industry.  But  I  do  this  under  the  express
proviso  that  a  team  of  legal  and  professional  experts  be  appointed
immediately to rework the Act as amended, once passed, without delay  so  as
to refine and improve it to become an Act of which we can be  confident  and
proud, as it was intended to be, that  does  not  contain  the  elements  it
currently includes.

In the meantime my province will press  ahead  with  its  own  processes  of
replacing Chapter 3  of  the  Act,  which  pertains  to  provincial  matters
relating to transport, with provincial legislation. Because we intend to  do
this thoroughly it will necessarily  take  time  and  we  will  consequently
continue to be reliant on  the  parent  Act  until  the  completion  of  our
processes.

I would like to move the following: that the amending Bill be  approved  for
further process, that a team of professional and legal experts be  appointed
immediately to refine the Act as amended, once passed, without delay.

Mr T MHLAHLO (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, the province of the  Eastern  Cape
supports this Bill.
Firstly, the amendments appear to have successfully addressed  the  problems
encountered in the interim bus service contracts at the time  when  planning
had not progressed to the stage envisaged at the time  of  promulgating  the
principal Act.

The amendments will therefore facilitate the breaking of the deadlock  which
currently exists in the process of tendering for bus services.

Secondly, the province notes further that the amendments  will  enhance  the
policy  of  regulated  competition  in  the  awarding  of  public  transport
contracts for bus services.

Thirdly, because of this Bill, current  tendered  contracts  have  now  been
extended, even if the public transport plans have not been finalised  as  is
required by the principal Act. For these reasons we, as  a  province,  fully
support this Bill.

We also wish to note the fact that the Eastern Cape has  witnessed  some  of
the worst incidents of taxi violence this year. I think the  incident  which
occurred immediately after the conference in Durban is known throughout  the
country.

Umtata, Buffalo City, East London, Bisho and King William's Town  have  been
the major flashpoints of conflict in the taxi industry. There had been  some
declaration of peace made by taxi associations  at  the  time,  but  it  was
short-lived and lacked substance in some cases.

Law-enforcement operations began in East London and surrounding areas on  10
October with the aim of normalising the situation in the taxi  industry.  It
is a simple routine joint police and traffic  action  to  maintain  law  and
order, with a special focus on the taxi industry.

The taxi operators  around  East  London  have  decided  to  withdraw  their
services to register their protest against the police action. We  view  this
as a very unnecessary action on their  part.  They  have  noted  with  great
concern that the taxi operators around East London have decided to  withdraw
their services in protest against this action.
The Department of Transport will provide an alternative form  of  transport,
like buses, for the general public. We note with concern that these acts  of
intimidation are largely  committed  by  taxi  operators  and  are  directed
against every vehicle travelling along our roads in the province.

We are also convinced that this new element of  counter-revolution,  if  you
like, is not a new practice in our province. We graduated in the  past  from
a violent apartheid policy and onslaughts by  the  military  forces  of  the
then apartheid regime, but we succeeded in getting to  where  we  are  as  a
country. We  are  still  convinced,  even  today,  that  we  will  meet  the
challenges  confronting  the  transformation  of  the  taxi  industry,   and
transport generally, in this country and that we will succeed.

We want to call on those who are involved in the taxi  industry  to  refrain
from allowing individuals to use public transport, and taxis in  particular,
as a springboard to launch counteractivities, particularly  in  the  Eastern
Cape. There is no need for this.

The Transkei seems to be the most active area  when  it  comes  to  violence
against public transport. We are also convinced that these elements are  not
necessarily taxi operators. These elements need to be captured because  they
are exploiting the successes that are beginning to emerge  within  the  taxi
industry to derail progress in our democracy.

We fully support this Bill. We are convinced that the hon  the  Minister  is
going to provide the necessary leadership and that we will  succeed  in  the
end. [Applause.]

Mr P D N MALOYI: Madam Chair,  hon  Minister  of  Transport  Comrade  Dullah
Omar,  special  delegates  present  here  today,  hon  members,  ladies  and
gentlemen, I stand before the House to  endorse  and  support  the  National
Land Transport Transition Amendment  Bill.  I  would  like  to  express  our
sincere appreciation to the Minister of Transport  and  his  department  for
having introduced these amendments in our House. This  clearly  demonstrates
the confidence he has in this House, and we thank  him  and  his  department
for that. Keep it up! I think these are the words from the select  committee
as a whole.

From 10 to  19  September  2001  all  the  nine  provinces  discussed  these
amendments with their hands faced up - without any hidden agendas -  seeking
ways and means of how to assist in  accelerating  change  in  the  transport
industry, and the taxi industry in particular.

It is worth mentioning that out of  the  nine  provinces,  five  had  public
hearings  whilst  the  other  four  had  discussions  in  their   respective
committees. As a committee and through individual members who were in  those
provinces, we assured both  the  public  and  our  committees  in  the  nine
provinces of our intention to utilise all contributions they made  prior  to
the sitting. Therefore, this suggests that  the  select  committee  and  all
other provinces agreed with the amendments to  this  Bill.  I  must  say  to
special delegates who are here today that, of course, we did  utilise  their
contributions and they are encapsulated in the Bill before them.

I would like to imagine that at this  moment  of  transforming  this  nation
into an equal society where peace, prosperity and harmony must triumph -  Mr
Raju  should  note  this  -  anyone  persisting  in  exhibiting  unwarranted
behaviour will forever regret those actions.

The New NP and the DP, if  they  are  ever  honest,  will  concur  with  the
statement that it is a historical fact that our terrible past  abounds  with
countless incidents of persecuting any critic of the state. We would  never,
as the ANC,  take  that  option  because  we  are  acutely  aware  that  our
democracy will never survive  if  there  is  an  attempt  by  the  state  to
suffocate critics' efforts. We will continue  to  encourage  people  to  air
their views about what the Government is doing  and  saying  because  it  is
those comments that enable the ANC-led Government to be  introspective.  But
we cannot allow anybody to misuse that space we have created.
I am saying this because, as I said earlier, in the committee where Mr  Raju
and Dr Nel are members, they agreed with all the amendments and Mr Raju  was
the champion of the suggestion that all the amendments should be agreed  to.
I am surprised that today he went outside and met his leader,  who  said  he
should come to this House and oppose those amendments,  and  simply  say  to
the House that the New  NP  supports  the  amendments,  but  for  the  wrong
reasons. If hon members were listening to Mr  Raju  when  he  was  speaking,
they will know that he was simply saying that these amendments are just  not
on. But he continued to say he supports them. The reality of the  matter  is
that they do not support the amendments, because if they did  support  them,
his reasons would be in line with what the ANC is saying and with  what  all
other provinces are saying.

I am also surprised that the Western Cape discussed this Bill on  the  19th,
and, in terms of both their negotiating  and  final  mandates  -  a  mandate
which was signed, of course - they indicated  to  the  committee  that  they
supported all the amendments. I am now surprised that the  special  delegate
here, the MEC from this province, seems not to know what  his  committee  in
the province or the legislature said. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Allow me first of all to thank  all  members  who
have participated in this debate for their stated support for  the  Bill.  I
appreciate the contributions of everyone, particularly the  attention  which
was drawn to a number of important areas.

I also want to thank the select committee, because,  if  one  looks  at  the
record, one will see that the select committee looked very carefully at  the
amendment and made suggestions of its own which were  then  incorporated  in
the Bill before this House. So the committee and this  House  are  not  just
rubber stamps. They look very carefully at the amendments  and  apply  their
minds to the matter. I want to thank the House and the committee  for  that.
[Applause.]

I am a little puzzled by the contributions of the hon Raju. I  must  say  he
is a nice man. We do get on very well. [Laughter.] But I  think  he  had  to
say what he did. What puzzled me is that the representative of  the  New  NP
did not stand and object. I will tell you why. Hon Raju says  that  the  DP,
as a responsible component of the DA, etc ... Of  course,  the  DA  has  two
components. The one component is ``responsible''. [Laughter.]  What  is  the
other component?  I think they  are  quite  capable  of  dealing  with  this
matter of who is ``irresponsible. I leave it to them.

An HON MEMBER: Marais!

The MINISTER: What is equally puzzling is that he should  be  talking  about
arbitrariness - that what we have done was  to  create  room  for  arbitrary
action. Because he brought in this element of  a  ``responsible  component''
of the DA, one must actually respond  when  he  talks  about  arbitrariness.
Judging from what has been happening outside in this city there has  been  a
great deal of arbitrariness; not only  arbitrariness,  but  dictatorship  or
attempted dictatorship on the part of the leader of the DP. [Applause.]

I suppose he said that because he was ordered to say it  as  the  hon  Raju.
[Laughter.] I hope that his fate will  not  be  the  same  as  that  of  the
honourable Mayor Marais. [Laughter.] But I think he tried his best to  avoid
that kind of fate. His leader says: ``I am the leader! I  decide,  and  you,
deputy leader, accept or you are part of ...  There  is  no  such  thing  as
leadership! There is no such  thing  as  democratic  discussion!  I  am  the
leader! You must accept! Do what I like now!'' Is that  not  the  height  of
arbitrariness if not dictatorship? Through you, hon Chair, I really want  to
say to the hon Raju that he should not talk about arbitrariness.

In fact, if one looks at the Bill, every  attempt  was  made  to  deal  with
possibilities of arbitrariness. The Bill deals with  this  matter,  that  is
the issue that the member raised. There is no question that tenders  can  be
dealt with on an arbitrary basis.
First  of  all,  our  Constitution  is  applicable  to  this  Bill  and  its
provisions. The Constitution and the law which makes provision for  judicial
reviews of all administrative action apply. Any action  by  a  body  dealing
with tenders which is arbitrary or wrong can be taken on review and  can  be
overruled by a court. We have adequate protection in our law  to  deal  with
all kinds of arbitrary action.

In this particular instance, care was  taken  to  ensure  that  the  current
public transport records,  which  were  prepared  under  the  National  Land
Transport Interim Arrangements Act of  1998,  would  be  deemed  to  be  the
current public transport records as required by the Act that we are  talking
about at the moment until the latter have been  prepared.  In  other  words,
the potential problem has been dealt with in this amending Bill.  I  do  not
have any problems with regard to the so-called arbitrariness. I  think  that
it does not exist.

I want to thank hon Shabalala for her input.  I  am  pleased  that  she  has
drawn attention to the fact that Mr Bassetti, the  representative  of  Acsa,
was wrongly quoted in the newspapers. I can say  to  the  hon  Ms  Shabalala
that that report has caused considerable damage,  because  on  the  side  of
Government  and  the  Airports  Company,  we  have  been  saying  that   the
development of King Shaka Airport at La Mercy is on the agenda.

All we need to do is to find out what the best way to go is,  and  what  the
alternatives are. That is what Acsa has been doing.  It  has  worked  out  a
number of scenarios. It says that these are the options before us, and  that
as Government, we should decide what we want, and let us talk  and  see  how
we can move forward with development.

As a result of the newspaper reports,  we  have  been  receiving  dozens  of
phone calls from many people in different parts of the  country,  protesting
against what they called the ``double-talk'' on the  part  of  the  Airports
Company and Government. I think that it was very important that  the  member
should have pointed out in this debate today that, in fact, the  debate  and
contribution were positive, and that the project  on  the  agenda  is  being
considered. Obviously, because it involves a great deal of  money  one  does
not simply recklessly jump into a project. One must work out what  the  best
way of proceeding is and this is what is happening at the moment.

Hon Dr Nel referred to Saboa and I want  to  let  him  know  that  there  is
constant interaction between the department and  Saboa.  It  meets  with  me
from time to time, and their concerns have been  taken  into  consideration.
We continue to meet with them to ensure that even if  problems  arise,  they
can be dealt with.

I understand that the portfolio committee will be  meeting  and  that  Saboa
will be at the portfolio committee of  the  NA.  So  it  will  have  another
debate. It meets with the department, it meets with  me  and  it  will  also
have an opportunity to meet  with  the  portfolio  committee.  There  is  no
problem with regard to arbitrariness, and I can assure this  House  that  we
will not allow arbitrary action to be taken by anybody.

A number of delegates and members have referred to the  taxi  processes  and
conference. I just want to say a few  words  about  that  in  my  concluding
remarks. The taxi conference which took  part  in  Durban  was,  indeed,  an
historic event. I want to point out to the House that it was the tip of  the
iceberg.  There  were  many  processes  which  preceded  the  national  taxi
conference. In eight of the nine provinces  democratisation  processes  have
taken place.

Most associations have adopted, by and large,  democratic  constitutions.  I
would like to mention the Eastern Cape as we had  a  problem  there.  It  is
divided into five regions.  In  each  of  the  regions  they  held  regional
conferences. They elected regional leaderships. Then there  was  an  Eastern
Cape provincial conference, which I myself attended. There  they  elected  a
provincial leadership. So there is an Eastern Cape Provincial Taxi  Council.


A number of the associations did  not  take  part.  That  is  true,  as  was
pointed out. We do have that kind of problem. But they do not represent  the
majority. They represent the minority. The provincial taxi council went  out
of its way before the national conference to involve everybody.

Rev Farisani, whom I mentioned in my opening address, visited  every  single
province. In the Eastern Cape he persuaded  the  provincial  leadership  and
others to come together so that everyone could feel  part  of  the  national
conference.  In  each  of  the  provinces  there  were  similar   democratic
processes. So one now has democratically elected  provincial  taxi  councils
in every province.

In  the  Western  Cape  a  somewhat   different   route   was   taken.   The
democratisation process is still proceeding. I think that with  the  support
of the provincial Minister we will see a provincial conference taking  place
in due course and a  leadership  elected.  However,  the  Western  Cape  was
there. Its delegation was there. Different groups who, perhaps, at one  time
did not talk to each other, were all at the conference.

I  think  there  has  been  a  wonderful  commitment  on  the  part  of  the
overwhelming majority in the taxi industry to  move  forward,  and  to  move
forward on the basis of peace. When the killings took place in  the  Eastern
Cape, I immediately communicated my concern  to  Minister  Tshwete,  and  he
acted immediately. He was in the  Eastern  Cape,  he  saw  the  MEC  in  the
Eastern Cape and together they  started  to  address  this  problem  without
delay.

I agree with the view that people who participate  in  violence,  and  those
who participated in the killing, must be arrested.  They  must  be  captured
and brought to court. They must be dealt with by our courts, and our  courts
must set an  example  that  that  kind  of  violence  is  not  going  to  be
tolerated.

However, by and large, that process is moving forward. I  can  say  that  at
the conference a special resolution was passed. The conference was  attended
by  approximately  1¬†000  delegates  from  all  over  the  country.  No  one
represented himself or herself. Everyone represented a constituency.  So  it
was a very democratic conference and  very  representative.  They  passed  a
resolution unanimously in  support  of  the  recapitalisation  programme  of
Government.

Since the conference,  I  have  met  on  occasion  with  the  newly  elected
leadership so that we move forward together and for us to see in  which  way
we can assist the leadership. Yesterday Minister Alec Erwin and I  met  with
the executive of Santaco to talk about recapitalisation and to  see  how  we
can work together to make sure that the process is a success.

There is no tension or difference between Government, on the one  hand,  and
Santaco  on  the  other.  We  respect  Santaco.   It   is   an   independent
organisation. It represents the taxi industry. We  have  our  views  on  the
side of Government, but we are working together  in  partnership  towards  a
common objective.

What I want to say is that we are not going  to  allow  those  who  want  to
derail processes to stand  in  our  way.  The  processes  to  formalise  the
industry, to ensure that it operates  according  to  law  and  according  to
regulation,  are  going  to  continue.  The  recapitalisation  programme  of
Government will continue in co-operation with the taxi industry.

Now and then, from time to time, we are going to have the kind  of  problems
that we have seen. I expressed the hope that we would have less and less  of
them. I have no doubt in my own  mind  that  the  forward  movement  of  the
industry, so that it becomes a  respected  industry  in  our  country,  will
continue.

The amendments here before this House are designed to  assist,  as  the  hon
Meyer pointed  out  in  part,  the  legalisation  process.  They  will  also
facilitate the continuation of the legalisation process. I have  every  hope
that the legalisation process will be successfully concluded.

The last issue is that of law enforcement. This is our one  big  problem  in
the  taxi  industry.  In  the  whole  transport  sector,  policing  and  law
enforcement remain crucial issues which still need to be addressed.  We  are
addressing these issues and I have raised them in Cabinet as  well.  But  my
hope is that with the support of this House we will  begin  to  develop  the
solutions  so  as  to  ensure  that  there  is  adequate  law   enforcement.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 17:53.

     Land Transport Transition  Amendment  Bill  [B  39  -  2001]  (National
     Council of Provinces - sec 76), dated 10 October 2001:


     The Select Committee on Public Services, having considered the  subject
     of the National Land Transport Transition Amendment Bill [B 39 -  2001]

     The Committee further reports as follows:


     A.     Public hearings


         1. The Committee initially intended to conduct public briefings  at
              Parliament,  and  an   advertisement   calling   for   written
              submissions was placed in  weekly  newspapers  on  11  and  12
              August 2001. In  order  to  reach  as  many  stakeholders  and
              communities as possible and to obtain  maximum  input  on  the
              Bill, it was later decided to cancel  the  nationally  planned
              public hearings and to appeal  to  all  provinces  to  convene
              public hearings  at  provincial  level.  Public  hearings  and
              departmental briefings were held in the provinces:


              *   Eastern Cape: 11 September 2001 - a briefing  meeting  was
                held in the Provincial Legislature.


              *   Free State: 10 to 14 September 2001 - a  briefing  meeting
                and public hearings  were  held  in  various  regions,  i.e.
                Bloemfontein, Trompsburg, Welkom, Qwaqwa and Parys.

                meeting and public hearings were held  in  various  centres,
                i.e.  the   Provincial   Legislature   (briefing   meeting),
                Ehlanzeni District Civic Centre (Nelspruit), Eastvaal Region
                and Enkangala District.


              *   Northen Cape: 12 September 2001 - a briefing  meeting  was
                held in the Provincial Legislature's Boardroom.


              *   Northern Province: 13 September 2001 - a briefing  meeting
                was held in the Provincial Legislature.


              *   North West: 14 September 2001 -  a  briefing  meeting  and
                public hearings were held in  the  Provincial  Legislature's
                Conference Room.


              *   Western Cape: 19 September 2001 - a briefing  meeting  was
                held in the Provincial Legislature.


         2. Members of the  Committee  were  deployed  to  their  respective
              provinces to facilitate the briefings and public  hearings  in
              collaboration with senior officials of the national Department
              of Transport.


     B.     Written submissions


         1.  Written  submissions   were   received   from   the   following
              stakeholders and members of the public:


              *   KwaZulu-Natal Public Transport Licensing Board
              *   South African Bus Operators Association
              *   City of Cape Town (Transport and Roads)
              *   Western Cape Department of Economic  Affairs,  Agriculture
                and Tourism
              *   Golden Arrow Bus Services (Pty) Ltd
              *   Mr Lucas Mangala, Welkom


         2. The above submissions were dispatched to all provinces  and  the
              national Department  of  Transport  for  consideration  during
              their briefing meetings and public hearings.


         3. The Committee further undertook to furnish  its  counterpart  in
              the National Assembly, the Portfolio Committee  on  Transport,
              with  all   submissions   received,   for   possible   further
              consideration.


     C.     Conclusion


         1.  The  Committee  wishes  to  express  its  appreciation  to  all
              stakeholders (with the  exception  of  Gauteng  who,  for  the
              second time, did not have a written mandate)  and  members  of
              the public who made submissions to  and  interacted  with  the
              Committee during its deliberations on the Bill.


         2. The Committee further notes the commitment and dedication  shown
              by the officials of the national Department  of  Transport  in
              that their work was  done  diligently,  despite  hiccups  with
              organising public hearings at provincial level.


         3.  The  Committee  further  notes  that  there  was   considerable
              agreement among almost all the provinces on the amendments  to
              the Bill, the end result being  implementable  legislation  to
              allow the development of public transport in South Africa.

ANNOUNCEMENTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    The Speaker and the Chairperson:


     (1)    The Minister of Finance submitted  the  Wysigingswetsontwerp  op
         Beheer van Aandelebeurse [W 75 - 2001]  (National  Assembly  -  sec
         75) to the Speaker and the Chairperson on 15 October 2001. This  is
         the official translation of the Stock Exchanges  Control  Amendment
         Bill [B 75  -  2001]  (National  Assembly  -  sec  75),  which  was
         introduced  in  the  National  Assembly  by  the  Minister  on   21
         September 2001.

TABLINGS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

Papers:

1.    The Minister of Finance:


     Written Explanation from the Minister of Finance in  terms  of  section
     65(2)(a) of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of  1999)
     setting out the reasons why the South African Revenue Service could not
     table its Annual Report and Financial Statements for 2000-2001 in time:


         Written Explanation in terms of  section  65(2)(a)  of  the  Public
         Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999)  for  late  tabling
         of Annual Report and Financial Statements


         In terms of section 55 of the Public Finance Management Act,  1999,
         the South African Revenue Service (SARS) must  prepare  and  submit
         its financial statements to the Auditor-General  and  the  relevant
         treasury within two months after the end  of  the  financial  year.
         The audited financial statements must be submitted to the  relevant
         treasury and to the Minister of Finance within five months  of  the
         end of that financial year.   Section  65  of  the  Public  Finance
         Management  Act,  1999,  provides  that  the  annual   report   and
         financial statements must be tabled  in  National  Assembly  within
         six months after the end of the relevant financial year.


         The financial statements of SARS,  as  a  public  entity,  must  be
         prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting  Practice
         (GAAP),  unless  the  Accounting  Standards  Board   approves   the
         application of Generally Recognised Accounting Practice (GRAP).  As
         the Accounting Standards Board has  not  been  appointed  yet,  the
         Accountant General (National Treasury),  performing  the  functions
         of the Board in terms  of  section  93(3)  of  the  Public  Finance
         Management Act, 1999, approved the application of  GRAP  on  21¬†May
         2001.


         Section 91(1)(b) of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999,
         however, also requires that the Minister of Finance must issue
         regulations prescribing the standards set by the Accounting
         Standards Board (in this case the National Treasury), before these
         standards can apply. Approval, in principle, was granted for the
         publication of these regulations and the regulations were
         published for public comment on 6 September 2001. Once the
         deadline for comment expires on 8 October 2001, the final
         regulations will be published after taking into account any
         comments received.


         In terms of section 55 of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999,
         the audited financial statements had to be submitted to the
         relevant treasury and the Minister of Finance before 31 August
         2001. As the regulations prescribing GRAP had not at that stage
         been published yet, SARS requested extension until 31 October 2001
         for the submission of the audited financial statements, which
         extension was approved by me on 14 August 2001.


         The annual report containing the financial statements can,
         therefore, not be tabled in National Assembly by the end of
         September 2001, as required by section 65 of the Public Finance
         Management Act, 1999, as the financial statements will only be
         finalised after the regulations setting the standards of GRAP have
         been published.

2.    The Minister of Transport:


     Report and Financial Statements of the Department of Transport for 2000-
     2001, including the Report of the Auditor-General on the Financial
     Statements of Vote 33 - Transport for 2000-2001 [RP 159-2001].

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs on
     study tour to KwaZulu-Natal, dated 4 October 2001:


     The Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs, having
     undertaken a study tour to KwaZulu-Natal on 24 and 25 May 2001, reports
     as follows:


     A.     Objective


         The Committee initially sent a delegation to KwaZulu-Natal as part
         of a series of visits that the Committee undertook to various
         provinces. Based on the report and recommendations of that
         delegation, at a meeting on 4 April 2001 the Committee decided to
         visit KwaZulu-Natal again.


         The Committee undertook the visit to deal with matters pertaining
         to land claims and restitution. The objective was to gather first-
         hand information of what people involved in the process of land
         claims and restitution felt about the process. This would in turn
         assist the Committee to recommend what should be done to remedy
         the situation. The decision to undertake the visit came as a
         result of numerous calls from different communities affected by
         land claims and restitution. The communities wanted members of the
         Committee to see for themselves what progress had been made so
         far.


     B.     Findings


         1. Delegation


              The delegation members were Ms B Thompson, Mrs N J Vilikazi
              and Mr R M Nyakane, accompanied by the Committee Secretary, Mr
              M Nguqu.


         2. Background


              The Committee approached the Regional Office of the Commission
              for the Restitution of Land Rights (the Commission) to arrange
              a visit in respect of settled claims. As the Committee had
              previously undertaken a visit, it specifically requested that
              there be continuity and that the same projects be visited.
              During 2000 the Committee visited the Cremin project outside
              Ladysmith and the Nazareth Community outside Rorkesdrift.


         3. Meeting with Regional Land Claims Commissioner


              Before the delegation visited communities, members had a brief
              meeting with the Regional Land Claims Commissioner (the
              Commissioner), Ms Thabi Shange. She outlined the progress made
              so far with land claims and restitution, and the frustration
              experienced by communities. She recommended that the Committee
              look at claims in different regional councils or district
              municipality areas. In addition, she informed the Committee
              that the claims recommended highlighted the different routes
              that those claims could take. On the one hand, a claim is
              settled in the Land Claims Court, while on the other hand a
              claim can be settled via the administrative route - section
              42D of the Restitution of Land Rights Act (No 22 of 1994), in
              terms of which the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs
              (the Minister) ratifies an out-of-court settlement between the
              claimants and the Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs
              (the Department).


              For the above reason, the Cremin and the Baynesfield
              restitution settlements were selected for the visit.


         4. Cremin Land Restitution Project


              (a) Historical background


                  The Mayibuye Cremin Restitution claim comprises 114
                  landowners of the farm Trekboer No 4225, commonly known
                  as Cremin, who were expropriated (dispossessed) by the
                  previous government. On 26 April 1995 the Mayibuye 1
                  Cremin Committee lodged a land claim on behalf of the
                  dispossessed landowners with the Commission. The claim
                  was accepted as complying with the terms of the Act, and
                  on 30 June 1995 the Commissioner gazetted the claim in
                  terms of section 11(1).


                  On 16 May 1996 the Committee, acting on behalf of the
                  claimants, entered into a deed of settlement, which
                  outlined that the State should restore the land rights to
                  the claimants by purchasing the land from the estate of
                  the late Derek Dreyer.


                  The claimants had been dispossessed of various
                  subdivisions and shares in subdivisions of the farm
                  Trekboer No 4225. They also held title to undivided
                  shares in a commonage. The total area under claim
                  therefore was 623,5821 ha in extent, situated about 25 km
                  from Ladysmith and approximately seven km from
                  Elandslaagte.


              (b) Progress


                  After hearing the matter, the Land Claims Court, on 15
                  October 1997, approved the restoration of the land to the
                  claimants. The cost to the State for acquiring the farm
                  was R210 000. The Department appointed personnel to
                  facilitate the restoration of individual title deeds to
                  the individual claimants. This was successful.


                  The Mayibuye 1 Cremin Committee representing the
                  claimants had established a trust to hold the commonage
                  and those of lots of other landowners. It would also
                  assist in facilitating the development of the area.


                  The Department had appointed LIMA, a development
                  consultancy, to complete a process of preliminary
                  planning in consultation with the community. A Joint
                  Planning Committee, consisting of all stakeholders, was
                  been put in place and is functioning well. A preliminary
                  business plan prioritising the community's development
                  needs is now in place, and its implementation is under
                  way.


                  The Department has secured ministerial approval for the
                  release of funding to support the settlement and
                  development process. The Minister has approved the
                  release of a restitution discretionary grant (RDG) to the
                  value of R309¬†000 and a special planning grant (SPG) to
                  the value of R138 000.


                  Furthermore, the Department entered into a transfer-of-
                  funds agreement with District Council 22, whereby the
                  latter would use the funds for implementation of the
                  preliminary business plan. However, these funds have
                  proved to be insufficient for the development and
                  settlement process. The Department and District Council
                  22 arranged a number of meetings with other line-
                  departments in order for them to become actively involved
                  in the project and also commit financial and human
                  resources to the process.


                  The Commission was also approached in this regard, and it
                  held bilateral meetings with municipal funding
                  organisations and development institutions to try and
                  secure additional funding to support the development
                  process. The District Council, together with the
                  Commission, will take these initiatives forward.

         5. Baynesfield Land Restitution Project


              (a) Historical background


                  The Baynesfield restitution claim comprises 101 former
                  labour tenants of the Baynesfield Estate. It has been
                  accepted as a Beneficial Occupation Claim in terms of the
                  Act, and on 17 November the Commissioner gazetted the
                  claim in terms of section 11(1). This was published in
                  the Gazette - Notice 1187 of 1995.


                  The Baynesfield Board of Administrators agreed to sell
                  portions 104 of the Farm Nelsrust No 849 and Erf 126
                  Thornville, 251,9 ha and 13,15 ha in extent,
                  respectively, for restoration to the claimants.


                  The claimant group is divided into 77 successful
                  financial claimants and 24 successful restoration
                  claimants.


              (b) Progress


                  The Minister approved the agreement prepared by the
                  Department in terms of a section 42D of the Act. The
                  financial value attached to the individual claims was set
                  at R22 872,90 per claimant's household.


                  A total of 24 families opted to return to portions 104 of
                  Farm Nelsrust 849 and Erf 126 Thornville, which had been
                  purchased by the Department from the Baynesfield Estate.
                  The total cost of the land was R300 000.


                  The 24 families who opted for restoration, have formed
                  themselves into a Trust known as the Zwelethu Community
                  Trust.


                  With a view to housing and agricultural development, the
                  estate agreed to release 260 ha of green agricultural
                  land.
                  The State Attorney is currently processing documents for
                  the transfer of the land to the Trust.


                  All 77 families who opted for financial compensation,
                  have been paid by iThala. A report is being prepared by
                  iThala Bank and will be verified by the official who had
                  monitored the process.


                  The provincial Department of Land Affairs has negotiated
                  with District Council 22 that the restoration group would
                  manage the implementation of Portion 104 of Farm Nelsrust
                  849 and erf 126 Thornville. This has been approved at
                  Executive Committee level (Resolution 10 - 1 February
                  2001). District Council 22 has further agreed to enter
                  into a transfer agreement with the provincial Land Reform
                  Office and the Commission in order to assist with the
                  implementation of the project. The Commission agreed with
                  the District Council that the remainder of the planning
                  grant funds would be released to the latter through a
                  transfer-of-funds agreement.


                  The Commission formulated a Joint Planning Committee,
                  comprising the District Council and the Departments of
                  Agriculture and of Housing, to attend to the planning of
                  the project and to further develop the preliminary
                  business plan.


              (c) Financial implications of Project Baynesfield


                  Number of restoration
                  claimant households 24
                  Individual claimant allowance 22 827,90
                  Total restoration allowance R547 827,60
                  Land purchase price R300 000
                  Balance of capital funds R247 869,60


                  The above capital funds balance has been transferred to
                  the Zwelethu Community Trust.


                  The total amounts budgeted for the Restitution
                  Discretionary and Special Planning Grants were R72¬†000
                  and R34 560, respectively. This development funding is to
                  be transferred to the District Council in terms of a
                  transfer-of-funds agreement for Integrated Development
                  Planning purposes.


     C.     Conclusions


         A number of issues, which were highlighted during the discussions
         on 24 and 25 May 2001, require urgent attention at senior
         management level and at programming co-ordination level. The
         following issues were common to both projects:


         1. The claimants were frustrated by long delays between dates of
             signature and implementation.


         2. While the claimants noted that the preliminary business plans
              were in place, they noted that these needed updating and that
              they required implementation schedules.


         3. The biggest issue related to prioritisation and top-up funding
              from the District Council.


         4. In the case of Cremin, this was very severe. Despite the fact
              that the project was brought to the attention of the District
              Council in 1998 and a formal transfer-of-funds agreement was
              entered into between the Department and the District Council,
              this project was not on any of the Council's lists for funding
              in respect of basic service delivery.


         5. In the case of Baynesfield, title deed registration has been
              delayed in the State Attorney's office.


         6. There is a dire need to secure further adequate funding from
              other government departments.


     D.     Recommendations


         The following recommendations were made during the course of
         discussions on 24 and 25 May 2001:


         1. The Commission should arrange a meeting between the Executive
              Major, the Local Councillor and the senior Management of the
              District Council to address the issue of prioritisation in
              respect of the projects for funding.


         2. The Commission should also commit itself to assist the Mayibuye
              1 Cremin Trust to approach other development funding
              organisations for top-up funding for projects like the
              reconstruction of the school.


         3. The Committee should approach the Minister to encourage greater
              co-ordination on land reform and basic services delivery
              between local government structures and the Department.


         4. It is further suggested that the national departments of land
              affairs and of local government should enter into a Memorandum
              of Understanding that would ensure the prioritisation of land
              reform projects and the guaranteeing of funds for land reform
              projects.
