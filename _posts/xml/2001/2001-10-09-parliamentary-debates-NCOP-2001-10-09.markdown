                                    ____

              PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF PROVINCES
                                    ____

The Chairperson took the Chair and requested members to observe a moment  of
silence for prayers or meditation.

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Could I please remind  members  that  when  the
bells have stopped ringing, it is assumed that the sitting will begin.  Once
we have come  into  the  House  and  the  members  introducing  matters  are
present, we should be able to proceed. Members should not gather around  the
Chamber. That makes it difficult for us to begin on time.  I  therefore  ask
that members pay attention to the time.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION
Mr K D S DURR: Madam Chairperson, at the next sitting of the  House  I  will
move:


  That the Council -


  (1) calls upon the South African Government to make it  abundantly  clear
       to a recent visitor, Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Féin and a leader
       of the Irish Republican Army, that -


       (a)  there is no longer any place for terrorism in the  world  today;
           and


       (b)  that all peace-loving people expect the IRA and their  terrorist
           partners to  end  violence,  including  the  bombing  of  public
           buildings,  to  decommission  all  their  weapons  and  arms  as
           requested by all involved in the peace process and  to  use  the
           goodwill of governments and  the  many  peaceful  opportunities,
           including  negotiation  and  the  ballot  box,  that  the   full
           democracies that exist in Britain and Ireland offer; and


  (2) further declares that until the IRA have done so, they and  Mr  Adams
       will be unwelcome visitors to our shores.

Mnr J L THERON: Voorsitter, by die volgende sitting  van  die  Raad  sal  ek
voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1)  die  koalisie-  of  alliansiemagte  gelukwens  met  die  suksesvolle
       aanvalle op die terroristemagte in Afganistan;


  (2) die vertroue uitspreek dat daar  nog  vele  suksesvolle  aanvalle  op
       terroristemagte wêreldwyd sal wees om hierdie euwel vir eens  en  vir
       altyd hok te slaan; en


  (3)  sy  volle  steun  en  solidariteit  met   die   koalisiemagte   teen
       wêreldterrorisme verklaar.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, at the next sitting  of  the  Council  I  shall
move:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the coalition or  alliance  forces  on  the  successful
       attacks on the terrorist forces in Afghanistan;


  (2) voices its trust that there will be many more successful  attacks  on
       terrorist forces worldwide in order to crack down on this  evil  once
       and for all; and


  (3) declares its full support  for  and  solidarity  with  the  coalition
       forces against world terrorism.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Could the sound engineers  make  sure  that  we
get the sound right? It is really intolerable that we have not been able  to
get the sound system to work properly over a number of weeks. I  think  this
is absolutely unacceptable.

                  CONGRATULATIONS TO CRICKETERS OF THE YEAR

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with great pleasure that two of our  up-and-coming  cricketers,
       Messrs Makhaya Ntini and Mfuneko Ngam, have been chosen to  be  among
       the Five Cricketers of the Year, no mean achievement when considering
       the odds that they had to overcome;


  (2) concedes that this elevation of previously disadvantaged  players  to
       the coveted elite group of five outstanding Cricketers  of  the  Year
       underlines the enormous strides that are taking place in  respect  of
       transformation in sport in South Africa;


  (3) rejects any notion that suggests that the selection of Makhaya  Ntini
       and Mfuneko Ngam was tokeny and/or quota-inspired; and


  (4) congratulates these fine players for their sterling contributions  to
       cricket.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                MARCH COMMEMORATING FALLEN IN ANGLO-BOER WAR

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the march which ended at the War Museum for  Women  and
       Children of the War in Bloemfontein on Saturday, 6 October 2001;


  (2) notes that the march was in memory of people who fell in  the  Anglo-
       Boer War;


  (3) further notes that only people of Dutch and Anglo-Saxon descent  took
       part in this march;


  (4) wishes to remind everyone that in that war indigenous  Africans  also
       took part on both sides of the war and that they too  were  shot  and
       killed;
  (5) notes that the human loss and hurt touched us all;


  (6) acknowledges that this bitter  past  which  brought  people  together
       belongs to all of us and makes our destinies intertwined; and


  (7) therefore calls upon everyone to utilise such occasions  for  working
       together  and  healing  rather  than  for   perpetuating   hurt   and
       separation.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                                 CENSUS 2001

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that today, 9 October 2001, heralds the start of Census 2001;


  (2) notes that a UDM member of the Eastern  Cape  Legislature  called  on
       people not to take part in the census;


  (3) calls upon all citizens to actively support the census; and


  (4) emphasises the importance of access to accurate figures in the  long-
       term planning of South Africa's future.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                            FRAUDULENT MARRIAGES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the reports in  the  national  media  highlighting
       fraudulent marriages performed by former employees of the  Department
       of Home Affairs;


  (2) urges all South Africans,  especially  women,  to  be  vigilant  when
       filling in forms requiring their identity documents  and  signatures,
       as this has  been  one  of  the  popular  ways  in  which  fraudulent
       marriages have taken place, unbeknown to the South African spouse;


  (3) encourages the Minister of Home Affairs to speed up  the  process  of
       investigation into these marriage agencies so that our  citizens  can
       be  protected  from  unscrupulous  scam   artists   undermining   our
       citizenship laws to gain illegal access to our country; and


  (4) calls on the Minister of Home Affairs to  finalise  as  a  matter  of
       urgency the pending legislation amending the Marriage Act that  would
       curb such fraudulent practices.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.
                  POISONING NEAR VANADIUM PROCESSING PLANT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr V V Z WINDVOEL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern a report by the Department of Minerals and  Energy
       into problems  at  a  vanadium  processing  plant  in  Steelpoort  in
       Mpumalanga;


  (2) further notes that in terms  of  this  report  the  levels  of  toxic
       chemical fumes are so high that  it  has  caused  83  of  the  firm's
       workers to be laid off due to ill-health over the past two years;


  (3) acknowledges  the  role  played  by  Mrs  Julia  Makofane,  a  highly
       qualified nurse  and  former  employee  of  the  mining  company,  in
       bringing the poisoning of workers and villages around the plant  into
       the open;


  (4) recognises that she has done so at great peril  to  herself  and  her
       livelihood;
  (5) commends her on her bravery; and


  (6) calls on the Department to speed up its investigation into the mining
       company to prevent the further poisoning of workers  and  communities
       around the mine.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                                 CANNIBALISM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with horror, shock and dismay the  incident  that  occurred  in
       Mandeni, KwaZulu-Natal, where a man was caught braaing the body parts
       of his five-year-old cousin, apparently having already eaten some  of
       the body parts;


  (2) expresses that this is a very devastating and  profoundly  disturbing
       act;


  (3) notes that this is the second gruesome act of  cannibalism  occurring
       in KwaZulu-Natal recently; and


  (4) calls on the Minister of  Safety  and  Security  to  leave  no  stone
       unturned in hounding out these miscreants in society who seem bent on
       pursuing their criminal agendas with impunity and capricious disdain.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       geleentheid skep -


       (a)  vir die  bou  van  brûe  tussen  die  verskillende  kultuur-  en
           taalgroepe van die gebied;


       (b)  om gemeenskapsprojekte te stimuleer deur byvoorbeeld -


           (i)   die Oasis-dienssentrum,  waar  liggaamlik  gestremdes  die
                  geleentheid gebied word om deur  die  donkiekartaxi's  vir
                  hulleself fondse te genereer;


           (ii)  die Kitsklets, die feeskoerant, wat deur leerders uit  die

       (c)  vir plaaslike en ander kunstenaars om hul talente tot wasdom  te
           bring; en


       (d)  vir mense om saam te werk, saam te lag en saam die  vreugde  van
           menswees en taal in die Noord-Kaap te waardeer;

(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:]


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note that -


       (a)  a motion was accepted by  the  Council  last  year  wherein  the
           community of Upington in the Northern Cape was congratulated  on
           the Kalahari Kuierfees which they hosted; and


       (b)  a unanimous decision was taken to personally hand over a  packet
           of raisins from the  Lower  Orange  River  and  a  container  of
           Kalahari sand as a gift of goodwill to the  President  of  South
           Africa;


  (2) once again takes note of  the  Kalahari  Kuierfees  which  officially
       opens tomorrow and that the Upington community be  wished  well  with
       this attempt, especially in the light of the fact that this  festival
       creates the opportunity -


       (a)  for the building of bridges between the different  cultural  and
           language groups of the area;


       (b)  to stimulate community projects such as, for example -


           (i)   the Oasis Service Centre, where physically disabled people
                    are  given  the  opportunity  to  generate   funds   for
                    themselves by means of the donkey cart taxis;


           (ii)  the Kitsklets, the festival paper,  which  is  managed  by
                    learners from previously disadvantaged communities - 120
                    learners received training in journalism to  equip  them
                    for this; and


           (iii)  purposeful  projects  where   local   talent   act   with
                  professional artists to prepare them for  when  they  are
                  afforded the opportunity to work;


       (c)  for local and other artists to bring their talents to  fruition;
           and


       (d)  for people to work together, to laugh together and to appreciate
           the joy of humanity and language in the Northern Cape;


  (3) further  notes  that  the  slender-tailed  meercat,  or  "Moesha"  in
       Setswana, is the logo of the year for the Kalahari  Kuierfees,  under
       the name "Graatjie" with the slogan "maak gat skoon";


  (4) resolves that a gift created by a street artist, Mr Shephard ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I am afraid that your time has  expired.
I will put the motion, and, should  the  House  agree  to  it,  it  will  be
published in full. You have won the speed-reading  contest,  but  your  time
has expired. You were granted far longer than the stipulated one and a  half
minutes.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, can I just  add  one  sentence,  because  I
want the House to take a decision on that specific sentence? I want to  move
that the gift donated by the people there  be  presented  to  the  President
when the time arrives.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             CHILD PROSTITUTION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1)  notes  that  child  prostitution  is  increasing  in  South  Africa,
       especially in our big cities;


  (2) also notes that children involved blame poverty for their behaviour;


  (3) further notes that child prostitution is not only detrimental to  the
       individuals involved but reduces the values of our society; and


  (4) therefore calls on all the departments concerned  to  work  with  the
       Department of Social Development in eradicating this  serious  social
       problem in our society.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       BENZENE POLLUTION IN WENTWORTH

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note that  according  to  media  reports  a  toxicology  expert
       recently advised the Durban City Health  Department  to  evacuate  at
       least five families from their homes in  Wentworth,  Durban,  because
       benzene pollution levels were three times higher  than  in  rush-hour
       traffic conditions;


  (2) further notes  that  the  aforesaid  levels  were  so  high  that  if
       residents were exposed to them over a lifetime,  it  is  likely  that
       some of the exposed individuals would develop blood cancer; and


  (3) urges the national Departments of Health and of Environmental Affairs
       and Tourism as well  as  the  health  departments  of  provinces  and
       municipalities to see to it that regular tests  are  carried  out  in
       areas affected by high pollution so as to ensure that the  rights  of
       citizens to a safe environment are at all times adequately protected.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Could I ask members please to  keep  the  noise
level down? I know that we do not often see one  another,  especially  those
of us from the provinces, but the meetings should be conducted outside  this
Chamber.

          DESIGNATION OF MR P D N BALOYI TO MAGISTRATES COMMISSION

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson,  I  move  the  draft  resolution
printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That the Council designates Mr P D N Maloyi to replace Mr J L Mahlangu on
  the Magistrates Commission.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 3(1)(a)(xi) of  the  Magistrates
Act, 1993 (Act No 90 of 1993).

               INTRODUCTION OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL FISCAL REVIEW

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Hon Chairperson, hon members,  MECs  here  present,
representatives of organised local government, ladies and gentlemen, at  the
outset, I would like to express my appreciation to the Chairperson,  to  the
Chief Whip of the Council and to Ms Mahlangu for having taken the  time  and
effort to make these  elaborate  arrangements  for  the  discussion  of  the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review.

I would also like  to  echo  the  sentiments  expressed  by  the  hon  Gouws
earlier, inviting all members to take a leadership  role  in  ensuring  that
South Africans participate in Census 2001.

Our Constitution enjoins us to  create  a  caring  democracy  built  on  the
strong foundation set out in our Bill of Rights. It also  requires  that  we
develop  appropriate   systems   of   government   which   recognise   three
interrelated and interdependent spheres by developing appropriate  norms  of
co-operative governance.

Because  decentralisation  is  necessary   for   effective   delivery,   the
Constitution assigns to provinces the delivery of  essential  services  like
school education, clinics and hospitals, the provision of social grants  and
welfare  services,  housing  and  roads.  Municipalities,  in   turn,   have
responsibility for the delivery of  essential  basic  services  like  water,
electricity, roads, streets and emergency services.

Provincial  and  local  governments  determine  their  own  priorities   and
budgets.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon Minister, could I interrupt and  ask
if you could try the other microphone? Unfortunately we do  have  a  problem
with our sound system.

The MINISTER: Madam Chairperson,  I  do  not  believe  in  forced  removals,
especially by the Chief Whip of the Council. [Laughter.]

The point was that provincial and  local  governments  determine  their  own
priorities  and  budgets.  They  are  governments  in   their   own   right,
accountable  to  their  legislatures  and  councils  and  tasked  with  real
responsibilities to serve their people.

The fiscal system cuts  to  the  heart  of  co-operative  governance,  which
requires  the  close  alignment  of  policy,  budgeting  and  planning.  Co-
operative governance will succeed because we are  able  to  co-ordinate  and
reconcile the priorities of the different spheres  and  transfer  sufficient
resources to enable  provincial  and  local  governments  to  provide  basic
services. The system  will  work  because  all  institutions  of  government
collect  all  revenues  due   and   make   appropriate   spending   choices,
effectively.

In preparing this  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review,  we  repeatedly  asked
whether these interrelationships are working  optimally,  and  what  we  can
learn from our experiences to improve the function of our  intergovernmental
relationships. The review - and I trust everyone has one by  now  -  focuses
on the outcomes of the nationally raised revenues shared with the two  other
spheres  of  government.  It  does  not  review  the  spending  by  national
Government. This task is best  dealt  with  in  the  national  Estimates  of
Expenditure that we publish alongside the Budget.

Provincial governments have the largest spending budgets,  totalling  R121,4
billion in 2001-02, and local governments about R62  billion,  after  taking
their own  revenues  and  transfers  into  account.  Sixty  percent  of  the
nationally  raised  revenues  available  after   servicing   our   debt   is
transferred to provinces and municipalities.
It is this fact that makes the review as important  as  it  is.  The  review
analyses expenditures and outcomes in  the  key  areas  of  social  services
delivery, education,  health,  social  services  and  infrastructure,  since
these are essentially areas of provincial competence. We  will,  in  future,
also examine other expenditure areas such as land and agriculture  that  are
essential to uprooting poverty. Similarly, we must recognise that  areas  of
national competence, like  the  criminal  justice  system,  all  add  up  to
measure the quality of life of South Africans,  alongside  those  which  are
covered by the review.

It is in this context that the annual Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review  must
be seen. There are three points  to  make  about  it.  Firstly,  the  review
focuses primarily on  budget  and  financial  information,  but  this  third
edition also focuses on  important  nonfinancial  information.  This  should
enable us to assess performance on service delivery, to set  benchmarks  and
to identify best practice. It  gives  us  a  sense  of  how  our  provincial
hospitals  are  shaping,  how  our  schools  measure  up,  how   our   local
governments do in their task to bring basic services to people.

Secondly, the relevance of the review  goes  far  beyond  these  numbers  or
service  delivery  indicators  or  achievements.  It  tells  us  about   the
difficulties and challenges facing the three spheres  of  government,  about
achievements, delivery challenges,  institutional  changes,  fiscal  choices
made and to be  made.  Through  this  learning  we  can  help  to  make  our
Constitution work better for the people of this country, and strengthen  the
provincial and local spheres to deliver better and more efficiently.

Thirdly,  the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  enables   us   to   learn.
Government must learn from its own experiences so that  it  can  improve  on
what it does. We have to learn from what we do  correctly  so  that  we  can
reinforce our successes, but we must also be mindful of our shortcomings  in
order to eliminate these. We cannot, in the short term, deliver on  all  the
expectations of our people, but democracy demands that we be mindful of  the
choices we make, and that we are able to report  on  the  implementation  of
those choices.

It is critical that this House and its members become the champions  of  the
use of the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review as  a  tool  to  address  broader
development and delivery issues. The Intergovernmental Fiscal Review  is  an
attempt to help us answer some difficult  questions  and  it  should  assist
Parliament, the NCOP in particular, legislatures and municipal  councils  to
strengthen  their  oversight  function.  It  is  the  story  of   remarkable
successes attained in a relatively short period.

The review details some essential elements of this wonderful  transformation
to democracy that we are all so important a part of. It is an invitation  to
engage with the executive in all spheres of government on what needs  to  be
done. More importantly, this process offers  a  significant  opportunity  to
advise on future spending choices, and hence on future  allocations  between
the three spheres. It allows us to assess key fiscal policy challenges  that
we face, together, as a country.

This year's review  covers  both  provincial  and  local  government  issues
across provincial  functions  like  education,  health,  welfare  or  social
development, housing and provincial roads,  and  looks  at  critical  issues
such as infrastructure and personnel. It details the challenges  facing  the
new  municipalities,  the  first  of  which  is  to  consolidate   the   new
structures, their staff and budgets. Hon members should bear  in  mind  that
in the newly demarcated local authorities we  have  brought  together  local
authorities where salary structures were vastly different.

Other challenges are, secondly, to co-ordinate  grants,  which  will  ensure
effective  capacity-building,   infrastructure   development   and   service
delivery; thirdly,  to  finalise  the  powers  and  functions  of  different
categories of municipalities, which will bring  greater  certainty  to  this
sphere;  fourthly,  to  improve  budgeting,  financial  planning  and   data
management; and fifthly to address  the  policy  and  implementation  issues
around the commitment to free basic services.

The review also details a number of lessons.  From  the  provinces  we  have
learnt, in respect of the previous reviews, of the remarkable turnaround  in
provincial finances since 1998-99. The review indicates that this  trend  is
continuing. Personnel spending moved from a high of 59% of total  provincial
spending in 1998-99 to 57,3 % in the previous fiscal year. Provinces are  no
longer running deficits, and are, in fact,  running  bigger  surpluses  than
projected.

There is a mistaken view out there that fiscal management in  the  provinces
leaves a lot to be desired. The facts contained in the review tell  quite  a
different story. There are a number of  successes  that  Government  can  be
proud of. I want to outline some of these briefly.

Spending on and the provision of social services are the  key  priority  for
provincial governments. The three social sectors, which we  have  mentioned,
cover about 83% of  provincial  budgets.  This  share  varies  by  province,
depending on the demographics and history. For example, poor provinces  like
the  Eastern  Cape  spend  about  22%  of  their  total  budget  on   social
development, whilst Gauteng spends  only  about  14%.  However,  given  that
Gauteng has more academic hospital complexes, it  spends  over  30%  of  its
budget on health, compared to the average of around 24%.

Nonetheless, the trends show progress, more access and greater  equity.  The
measurable inequalities  between  provinces  present  -  to  this  House  in
particular, I believe - the greatest ongoing  challenge  for  all  decision-
makers.

We have made good progress in turning the  education  system  around.  Given
the legacy of apartheid, the transition over the past five  years  has  been
tough. Despite the many problems, the transition in education has been  well
managed, mainly due to the co-operative relationship  between  the  national
and provincial governments and between the education  and  finance  arms  of
government. We live in the same house.

Enrolment rates increased in South Africa to about 12,3 million learners  in
1997, mainly due to a concerted effort to increase  school  enrolment  after
1994. Learner-educator ratios declined from about 33,7 in 1996 to 32,7  last
year. More importantly, the average class size declined from 43 to  38  over
the same period. Over 25 000 classrooms have been  built  since  1996.  Most
provinces report a reduction in the number of schools that are  overcrowded,
with the notable exception of Gauteng and the Western Cape.

There have also been great leaps in coverage of the social grants system  to
the aged, children under six, foster care and the disabled. This success  is
probably Government's most effective tool in alleviating poverty. There  are
now 3,9 million beneficiaries of social grants. We will know if that  is  8%
or 10% at the  conclusion  of  Census  2001,  of  course.  But  3,9  million
beneficiaries of social grants is a phenomenal  number  of  people  who  are
dependent on this, and it is very clear that this then  has  to  be  a  very
effective means for tackling the grinding  poverty  that  so  many  have  to
face.

The number of beneficiaries in 2003 is expected  to  double  from  the  1998
figure. This rate of change is unsurpassed anywhere, but we  must  recognise
that this remarkable take-up of grants places enormous stress on  provincial
social  welfare  budgets.  Welfare  grants  and  services   will   play   an
increasingly  important  role  in  countering  the  impact  of  HIV/Aids  on
household vulnerability, especially the need to care for  orphans  below  15
years of age who have lost parents due to Aids. The beneficiaries of  foster
care grants grew from about 40 000 in April 1997 to 79  437  in  March  last
year due, in part, to the increasing number of Aids orphans.

The extension of primary  health  care  has  made  basic  health  care  more
accessible to all South Africans.  Provincial  health  expenditure  grew  by
more than 2% over inflation in 2001-02 from R24,1 billion  in  the  previous
year to R26,4 billion in the current year. Indeed, the private  health  care
system only allows access to less than one  fifth  of  all  South  Africans,
mainly those covered by medical aid schemes. We must not allow this  gap  to
widen. The review points out that 84% of the population is  not  covered  by
medical aid or health insurance. With less funding, the  public  sector  has
to care for a much larger number of people than the private sector.

One of our key areas of achievement is clearly in primary health  care,  and
the  review  cited  surveys  that  show  much  progress  in  areas  such  as
substantial increases in antenatal care;  improvement  in  turnaround  times
for various tests,  including  HIV/Aids;  wider  treatment  of  tuberculosis
through the  Dots  programme;  reduced  patient  loads  at  clinics;  doctor
availability  at  clinics;  a  marked  increase  in  the   availability   of
electricity at clinics;  and  increases  in  the  availability  of  condoms,
oxygen, penicillin and oral contraceptives.

Hon members will learn from the review that the distribution of  all  health
professionals - doctors, specialists, dentists and nurses - is  unbelievably
uneven across the provinces. This set of statistics and  the  fact  that  we
are aware of it presents us with enormous policy challenges.  In  fact,  the
number of doctors, general practitioners and specialists in  provinces  like
Gauteng and the Western  Cape  is  so  much  higher  than  the  North  West,
Northern Province and Eastern Cape. So the challenge  of  getting  qualified
professionals into provinces and areas where people do not  have  access  to
private health care is one of the challenges that  the  review  presents  us
with quite starkly.

Government spent over R16 billion on provincial housing development  between
1994-95 and last year, R11,2 billion of which was spent since 1997-98.  This
contributed towards the building of more  than  1,1  million  housing  units
accommodating about 4,9 million people. Apart from providing  shelter,  this
also means job creation. The challenge remains vast, and one person  without
shelter, one household without water, is one too many. But  a  serious  dent
has been made in redressing the backlogs.

Infrastructure  spending  is  now  growing  strongly.  Capital  spending  in
provinces rebounded with a 19% increase to R7,6 billion  and  all  provinces
have  been  spending  more  each  year  now.  This  trend  should  continue,
bolstered by the additional funding announced in the Budget this year.  Over
the medium term, provincial capital expenditure is set to grow  strongly  at
an average rate of a whopping 23% and is set  to  surpass  the  R14  billion
mark by 2003-04. It will thus more than double its 1999-2000  level.  During
this period, the provincial share of  funding  for  capital  expenditure  is
expected to rise from R3,5 billion in the last fiscal year to  R7,4  billion
by 31 March 2004, at which time the provincial share will be  52%  of  total
capital expenditures.

One  looks,  similarly,  at  local  government  for  the  lessons.  We  must
recognise that enormous changes have  been  effected  in  respect  of  local
government since the period under review. Hon  members  would  observe  that
the section on local government has been expanded in this  edition  to  four
discrete  chapters.  The  changes  were  the  result  of  the   process   of
demarcation and the establishment of 284 new municipalities created  by  the
elections last year.

In many respects the lessons of the  earlier  period  will  prove  extremely
important to delivering the quality  of  democracy  which  local  government
must provide, the kind which touches the lives of  all  of  us  on  a  daily
basis.

We have advanced substantially with  local  government  transformation,  and
the fiscal conditions to support  developmental  municipalities  are  taking
shape. Transfers are being consolidated  to  ensure  that  they  effectively
support a municipal sphere that serves communities best, and that  addresses
the needs of the poor. The report shows, however, that  many  transformation
issues require very careful consideration to ensure that the new  structures
are fiscally sustainable.

The powers and functions  of  district  and  local  municipalities  must  be
clarified soon, to assist planning and budgeting  and  to  create  certainty
for investors. The shifting  of  functions  not  only  entails  shifting  of
funds, but also of personnel. Similar pressures apply when restructuring  in
sectors such as electricity and water. Grants need to  be  co-ordinated  and
better targeted.

The need is to accelerate budget reforms, introduce three-year  budgets  and
develop more management-orientated budget formats, as the Municipal  Finance
Management Bill intends to do. Municipalities  must  develop  credible  IDPs
that link to their budgets and that take available resources into account.
Public resources for the expansion and  improvement  of  municipal  services
will  be  limited.  A  key  tool  to  expanding  service  delivery  is   the
development of partnerships with the private sector, either in the  form  of
equity partnerships in which  private-sector  skills  are  used  to  improve
service  delivery  or  through  responsible  municipal  borrowing.  National
Government has developed robust regulatory  frameworks  for  both  forms  of
partnerships.

The review notes  the  successes  in  equity  partnerships  that  have  been
achieved, particularly through the  work  of  the  Municipal  Infrastructure
Investment  Unit.  Municipal  borrowing,  however,  has  remained   stagnant
despite enormous infrastructure backlogs. Apart from  the  Development  Bank
of Southern  Africa  and  Inca  -  the  Infrastructure  Finance  Corporation
Limited  -  most  institutions  are  not  lending  to  municipalities.  This
highlights the importance of providing a stable  and  predictable  framework
for both lenders and municipalities themselves.

The commitment to free basic services fits  our  developmental  agenda,  and
policy work is moving ahead to ensure that we  do  get  this  right.  To  be
successful, municipalities must carefully  target  those  this  policy  must
benefit, and focus time and energy on managing this  implementation.  Fiscal
constraints require that we first target people who  cannot  afford  to  pay
for the basic level of essential services,  to  avoid  what  MEC  Godongwana
calls ``middle-class capture.''

National funding assists local governments through the equitable  share  and
municipal  infrastructure  grants.  Priority  must  be  given  to  extending
essential services to those who have no  service,  and  to  providing  basic
services to those who cannot afford to pay.

However, cost  recovery  is  central  to  any  sustainable  subsidy  system.
Municipalities must apply tighter credit control to consumers that are  able
to pay. This not only improves cash  flows,  but  also  releases  additional
funds to subsidise consumers who cannot pay.

I now want to focus on some of the key lessons  from  the  review  and  what
they suggest for the future. Firstly, there are  considerable  institutional
and management challenges. There is much to be learnt  from  the  provincial
experience, both for the provinces themselves, and in our  approach  to  the
local sphere as it goes through its final stage of transformation.

Provinces are now enjoying the benefits arising from better  management  and
policy manoeuvrability, though there is  still  a  deficit  of  skilled  and
experienced  managers,  especially  in  the  middle  to   lower   ranks   of
management. I think what readers of the report will find is that it is  less
an issue now of the availability of money or of  well-constructed  policies.
Many of the difficulties we encounter are in the management of the  delivery
of services, in the performance by the lower ranks of  the  Public  Service,
and that is a challenge that, clearly, we must be able to address.

These personnel problems affect provinces as  they  seek  to  improve  their
financial management, establish proper internal controls and  implement  the
PFMA. The challenge is to enhance the culture of  service  delivery  and  to
live the principles of Batho Pele. Governments  in  all  spheres  must  make
every effort to attract and retain professional staff, and  they  must  look
into ways to make all staff more service-oriented.

We must continue to align policy choices with spending. In  recognising  the
formidable changes that have taken place, we must sharpen the focus  on  the
outcomes of resource allocation. The PFMA is a powerful tool to measure  the
changes taking place. We have a responsibility to trumpet the  successes  in
financial management by provincial  governments  because  this  creates  the
policy space to drive transformation. At the same time, we  must  commit  to
developing new instruments to measure the impact on the  lives  of  intended
beneficiaries.

So it is beyond the big numbers. It is beyond how much we  spend  on  social
services such as education or social welfare. We need to be able to  measure
what happens in the life of a learner or  a  pensioner.  That  is  the  next
stage of this and clearly something that we hope to come  from  the  process
of review that this Council must undertake.

Our new municipalities face considerable  challenges  in  expanding  service
delivery to all South Africans.  These  include  the  establishment  of  new
institutional  structures.  The  demarcation  of  boundaries  created   some
municipalities that must be built from  the  ground  up,  and  the  need  to
absorb personnel into new organisations, as a result both  of  amalgamations
and of the reorganisation of the powers and functions of municipalities.  As
highlighted in the review, the  cost  of  personnel  and  benefits  has,  in
recent years, been the highest cost driver for municipalities.

The  transfer,  movement  and  placement  of  staff  in  newly   amalgamated
municipalities have added upward pressure to equalise on  salary  and  other
employee benefits. This  issue  is  possibly  the  most  critical  area  for
consideration and sober  discussion.  The  outcomes  of  this  process  will
determine whether adequate resources are available for us to expand  service
delivery to all citizens. Similar pressures apply to  the  restructuring  of
the electricity industry.

Each government must take full responsibility for exercising its powers.  We
should not create perverse incentives which reward poor conduct. The  fiscal
system must have the appropriate incentives to ensure that  all  governments
improve  their  management.  We  recognise  the  decision-making  power   of
provincial and local governments and we give them discretion,  and  thus  we
make them duly accountable for the services they need to deliver.  In  fact,
the turnaround  in  provincial  finances  shows  the  potential  for  policy
manoeuvrability. Government did not throw money at  the  provinces.  Section
101(a) was used very widely and consultatively, but essentially the  changes
happened within provinces when the fiscal constraint was understood.

Affordability is a major issue. The report shows, for  example,  that  while
Government has contributed to more than 1,1 million houses built since  1994
and provided many social and basic  services,  beneficiaries  cannot  always
afford municipal service charges. So how do we work smarter  to  reduce  the
costs and offer people real choices? How do we ensure rapid and  sustainable
improvements in the quality of life of people, where  all  the  basic  needs
are met? How do we make it affordable for them, and support it in ways  that
are fiscally sustainable for the sphere of government concerned?

Any  decentralisation  must  be  well-considered  and  properly   sequenced.
Provinces and municipalities will perform better  if  duly  accountable  and
empowered, and not stretched beyond their capacity. We have made many  major
changes, over the past seven years, to  enhance  democratic  accountability,
fiscal sustainability and service delivery. We are in  no  doubt  about  the
need for major change, but the trade-offs and fiscal  implications  must  be
carefully considered. This review gives us a lot  of  stimulating  data  and
ideas to think through these issues and manage the choices.

In conclusion, the review is born of the desire  to  empower  provinces  and
local governments, and those who deal with them. It will assist  Parliament,
and the NCOP in particular, in its oversight function.

A government alive to its responsibilities to build a  deep  democracy  must
continually appraise its own performance. It must ask itself  the  questions
that the review attempts. They are questions such as: Are we  giving  effect
to the requirements of the Constitution? This question must be asked not  in
a legal technical sense, but in respect of empowering  the  various  spheres
of  government  to  fulfil  their  respective  mandates.  Are  our  policies
adequate to provide democracy in the form of essential and  shared  services
to our people? Is governance co-operative? Does each  sphere  of  government
make the appropriate  spending  choices?  Is  spending  efficient?  Does  it
collect revenue optimally? Are there unfunded mandates? What  has  been  the
progress towards improving financial management? Has an effort been made  to
equip  departments  with  the  appropriate  skills   to   manage   financial
resources? Are there measurable improvements in the delivery  of  goods  and
services? What does the comparative analysis of  similar  spheres,  be  they
provinces or local authorities, teach us? Are we making sufficient  progress
in eliminating backlogs?

These are tough questions with no easy solutions. This is what we offer  the
NCOP as a subject for detailed examination. As I  have  already  stated,  we
invite distinguished members to analyse the report in the  minutest  detail.
We wait to be advised in this House on  23  October  in  the  report  to  be
tabled as feedback to us.

This is an enormous undertaking in the building of  accountable  government.
Every aspect of the report will be considered by  us.  The  observations  of
members from their constituencies matter immensely,  because  they  are  the
litmus test of what  we  observe  from  the  perspective  of  the  Treasury.
Similarly, the  suggestions  which  this  House  will  make  in  respect  of
realigning spending priorities in the future  will  be,  obviously,  closely
studied.

So I invite this  House  in  placing  the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review
before it and you, Chairperson, to  build  the  caring  democracy  that  the
Constitution entreats us  to  do,  and  that  we  undertake  this  together.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Madam  Chairperson,  hon
members, MECs here present, representatives of organised  local  government,
ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly honoured to have been  invited  both
by  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  by  your  good  self,  Chairperson,  to
participate in the discussion of the Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review.  This
review posits as its end the provision of  insights  into  service  delivery
progress in provinces and municipalities.

Although, as a practice, the review was initiated in 1999, 1994 is the  most
appropriate marker for the beginning of a period on the basis of  which  the
dividend of democratic governance must be evaluated. We inherited a  country
whose income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is  among  the
worst in the world. Embedded  in  the  structure  of  our  economy  are  the
historical disabling mechanisms which constrain the  poor  from  extricating
themselves from their situation.

An assessment of the growth of the economy over  the  last  30  years  shows
that the GDP growth rate has fallen from an average of nearly 6% during  the
1960s to around  3%  during  the  1990s.  This  assessment  also  reveals  a
sustained period during which our  economy  languished  in  negative  growth
territory. The economic rebound that began in 1994 is,  indeed,  a  function
of fiscal prudence and good governance.

As was to be expected, we managed to ride on the back of that political  and
economic flowering to begin addressing the problems of economic  disparities
by using the Budget as an instrument of distribution. An examination of  the
intersphere distribution of  the  Budget  shows  that  56,4%  of  nationally
collected revenue  goes  to  the  provinces,  while  health,  education  and
welfare account for the bulk of provincial spending.

Their share of total provincial spending is expected to stabilise at  around
81% of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. This  means  that  within  our
intergovernmental fiscal relations configuration the  provincial  government
sphere serves as the institutional repository for distribution.

The period since 1994 has seen extraordinary social  transformation  in  the
areas of education, health, social development and  housing.  In  education,
we achieved school enrolment rates which  signalled  Government  success  on
the issue of access to  basic  education.  On  the  health  front,  we  have
realised an unprecedented increase in antenatal care. Child  support  grants
and old age grants continue to broaden their coverage rates.

It is this Government, and no other, which contributed to over  one  million
low-cost houses being built, giving shelter to 4,9 million  people.  Indeed,
1994 to the present marks  a  period  of  social  transformation  which  has
positively changed South African society  more  profoundly  than  any  other
period of comparable brevity.

What I said earlier about our economy's lack of robust capacity  for  growth
speaks to the immense challenges facing all three spheres of government.  We
need  a  methodical  approach,  which  begins  with  the  premise  that  all
societies must reproduce themselves from year to  year,  and  this  requires
that they engage in material production. Unless  we  are  informed  by  this
perspective,   we   will   not   be   able   to   mitigate   the   recurring
disproportionality between production and consumption.

It is trite to  say  that  our  Constitution  enjoins  us  to  create  local
jurisdictions within which we have  to  build  institutions  that  influence
governance, service delivery  and  economic  growth.  Amongst  the  mutually
conditioning forces of delivery and growth, we should be able to  accentuate
growth as the focal and driving force. In other  words,  the  municipalities
in our intergovernmental schema, designed to play the role of  providers  of
economic growth, require a strategic intervention which  centres  itself  on
growth and distribution. Unless we understand the profound  implications  of
this arrangement, our initial forays into redressing the disparities of  the
past are in danger of being reversed.

Local government, as a sphere of government, is  at  a  formative  stage  of
evolution. As it evolves, we must always keep the  relationship  between  it
and the other spheres on  our  radar  screens.  As  local  government  gains
confidence and the requisite capacity to discharge its  mandate,  this  will
have implications for the vertical split of  nationally  collected  revenue.
More importantly, the growing maturity of local government will serve  as  a
catalyst for the refinement of the entire system of governance.

It will soon be one year since the 2000 local  government  elections,  which
inaugurated the new local government system. Since  December  last  year  we
have moved fairly rapidly to establish the new municipalities. All  the  284
new municipalities are in place. We now have to focus  on  giving  them  the
capacity to carry out their developmental obligations.

Issues of capacitating municipalities and simultaneously  reigniting  growth
will put short-term spending pressures on us.  In  order  to  meet  some  of
these pressures, national and provincial government  departments  have  been
looking at their own budgets with a  view  to  reprioritisation.  Given  the
tightness of some budgets, especially those of provincial departments,  some
have wondered whether there is enough room to  manoeuvre.  Yet  others  have
asked whether it is possible and desirable to sustain low  deficits  in  the
face of many  unaccomplished  tasks,  which  bear  on  the  quality  of  the
collective life of our people.

We have to move  beyond  this  polarisation  of  argument  and  find  a  new
synthesis capable of  taking  us  forward  on  a  basis  that  is  firm  and
productive.  I  hope  that  this  review   will   provide   all   governance
practitioners with the information base which will underpin  our  collective
decision-making and action. [Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Madam Chair, on behalf of the NCOP,  as  a  House,  I  feel
very  honoured  and  privileged  to  receive  this  document  on  behalf  of
everybody here. I welcome the Minister  of  Finance,  Mr  T  A  Manuel,  the
Minister for Provincial  and  Local  Government,  Mr  Sydney  Mufamadi,  the
Deputy Minister of Finance, Mr Mphahlwa, and MECs present here today.

The Intergovernmental Fiscal Review is one of the most important  tools  for
members of Parliament to hold the  executive  accountable.  It  will  enable
members to do their oversight work with a better  understanding  of  issues.
This affords us the opportunity of bringing all spheres of government  under
one umbrella to discuss service delivery issues.  The  Minister  of  Finance
referred to this.

This document will help all of us to see whether there is  value  for  money
for every rand that has been spent, which has been voted by this  Parliament
and  by  respective  provincial  legislatures.  We  also  need  to   measure
efficiency in the delivery of services in our quest to improve the lives  of
poor people that we represent in this Chamber.

The document takes stock not only of what  has  happened  in  the  past  few
years until March 2001, but  also  affords  us  an  opportunity  to  do  the
following: firstly, to assess whether decisions we have made thus  far  have
had a positive impact on people's lives;  secondly,  to  further  review  or
consider policy options if necessary and  change  strategies  and  approach;
and lastly, to also look ahead with pride  because  of  the  road  traversed
thus far.

The week ahead is of crucial importance to all of us and  many  citizens  of
our country,  because  members  will  be  discussing  the  contents  of  the
document with several members  and  MECs,  legislatures  and  civil  society
bodies. We invite everyone to take a keen interest while  these  issues  are
being discussed in the precincts of Parliament.

I just want to outline the programme of what  is  going  to  happen  between
tomorrow and next week. We are going to have a discussion with the  Minister
of Finance on the broad  provincial  spending  trends,  which  will  include
MEC's of finance and other interested  bodies  and  our  colleagues  in  the
National Assembly who have been invited. On  Friday,  12  October,  we  will
discuss the social development chapter with  the  Minister  responsible  and
discuss  the  education  chapter  with  the  Minister  of  Education.  These
discussions will be at different times and will go on until 5 o'clock.

On Monday we will deal with the infrastructure  chapter.  The  Ministers  of
Finance, roads, Public Works and respective MECs thereof will  be  involved.
On Tuesday, the chapter on health  will  be  dealt  with.  On  Wednesday  17
October,  the  chapter  on  Public  Service  will  be  dealt  with  and  the
discussion will include housing, transport  and  other  representatives.  On
Thursday the local  government  chapter  will  be  dealt  with,  which  will
include the MECs of local government and the Minister concerned.

The committee will be given an opportunity to formulate its report and  will
come back to the NCOP on 23 October to have the first part  of  the  debate.
The debate will be concluded on 24 October. Because this is a  very  intense
debate we cannot finish it in one day. I also want to  thank  the  committee
clerk who has also done sterling work by putting  this  programme  together.
Once again, my sincere appreciation goes to Henry Eksteen  individually  for
the work that he has done.

The tabling of this report in our Chamber  is  very  important,  because  it
will link up with the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement  process  that  is
going to be tabled in October. The report will form part and parcel  of  the
process  as  we  proceed  to  discussing  the  Medium-Term   Budget   Policy
Statement. It will be a benchmark for  Government  priorities,  as  will  be
outlined in the statement tabled in October.

In my travels around the globe, I have come to appreciate  our  country  and
our achievements more than ever. A lot of  work  has  been  done,  but  more
still needs to be done. The groundwork covered thus far gives  us  hope  for
the future. May I call upon members to  rise  to  the  occasion  or  to  the
challenge and engage  the  document  with  the  vigour  and  credibility  it
deserves as the information is fairly accurate.
May I once again remind the nation that tomorrow is the beginning of  Census
2001, from 10 October to 31 October. Let us all be  counted.  The  relevance
of this exercise is well expressed in the ANC Today in  that  ``The  results
of the census provide statistics for planning, not only  by  Government  but
also  business,  foreign  investors  and  individuals.''  Hon  member   must
remember to be counted. It is in the interests of the nation to be counted.

Once again, I want  to  commend  the  department  for  releasing  the  third
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review under  the  leadership  of  Mr  Manuel,  his
deputy and all the officials in  the  provincial  and  national  treasuries.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! That concludes  the  discussion.  As  Ms
Mahlangu  and  Minister  Manuel  have  indicated,  there  will  be   further
opportunity for a more detailed debate and review of  the  contents  of  the
report that has been introduced by Minister Manuel.

                        EDUCATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

      GENERAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING QUALITY ASSURANCE BILL

               (Consideration of Bills and of Reports thereon)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, members,  representatives  of  local
government, particularly the MECs  who  are  present,  I  have  pleasure  in
introducing these two section  76  Bills  today,  one  which  we  hope  will
improve the quality of education at general and  further  education  levels,
and one which will introduce some necessary changes  to  the  South  African
Schools Act to prevent, largely, the abuse of school funds.

The quality of education  has  become  a  priority  area  of  focus  for  my
Ministry  and  department.  We  spent  the  first  years  of  our  democracy
establishing a single national  education  system  in  the  country.  It  is
unparalleled that we have been able to achieve that out of the  detritus  of
apartheid. Now we have to look at what we are getting for  the  21%  of  our
Budget spent on education.

One of the instruments we are currently using is the systemic evaluation  of
learner achievement, which will measure the progress of learners across  the
country at Grades 3,6 and 9. This removes the myth  that  in  outcomes-based
education there is no testing of children. This  will  ensure  that  we  are
able to measure the quality of learning at  an  early  stage  and  not  wait
until the end of the 12 years before picking up any problems. This is a  new
development introduced by me  to  ensure  that  certain  minimum  levels  of
literacy and numeracy are  achieved.  I  should  say  that  the  problem  of
literacy in Grade 3 is a universal problem, not limited to South Africa,  by
the way.

Another instrument is the policy on whole school evaluation, which  we  have
recently determined. This instrument will  look  at  the  functioning  of  a
school as a whole organisation, through an in-depth investigation by a  team
of trained evaluators. We shall then know what is actually happening in  our
schools, how our teachers and principals are performing, instead of  relying
on anecdotal tittle-tattle. I am looking forward  to  the  results  of  both
these instruments, which I will make  available  to  the  public  to  ensure
accountability. This is a very important development.

The purpose of both of the above attempts to intervene  in  the  process  of
schooling is  to  ensure  that  standards  are  not  only  beginning  to  be
established, but are maintained along the way. I am very impressed,  by  the
way,  at  what  is  happening  in  our  primary  schools  with   the   first
postapartheid intake now. These are going to be the geniuses of the  future,
without exaggeration. They have extraordinary resilience, chutzpah and self-
possession. These will be, in fact, our intake in a  few  years'  time  into
secondary school.

The third leg of quality assurance relates to the exit standards  which  are
achieved, and these are  reflected  in  the  final  examinations  and  their
results. Historically, we have made use of  the  SA  Certification  Council,
otherwise known in terms of our obsession with acronyms, as  Safcert,  which
has certified the results of provincial  matriculation  examinations.  There
has been a national system -  it  is  not  something  invented  by  the  ANC
Government - to certify results and to give authenticity to a South  African
qualification. This council has done much to maintain public  confidence  in
the  matric  examination,  particularly  since  1994.  I  must   extend   my
appreciation to  it  for  its  valuable  work.  Now  we  are  expanding  the
boundaries of quality assurance, based on the view that this cannot just  be
an ex post facto process of certification, after the event in  other  words.
This should rather be a continual process  which  feeds  quality  needs  and
imperatives back into the  system.  It  is  not  enough  to  simply  monitor
learning achievements. The aim must surely be to improve these, and this  is
stated in the preamble to the Bill.

We are therefore proposing in the Bill the establishment of  a  new  body  -
the Minister of  Finance,  of  course,  does  not  like  new  bodies  to  be
established, particularly because they cost money. But, let me tell  him  in
his presence, that this will replace Safcert  and  take  responsibility  for
the quality assurance of institutional programmes  in  the  general  grades,
Grades R to 9 and, further, Grades 10 to 12,  the  education  bands  of  the
national qualifications framework.  This  proposal  is  based  on  extensive
research, both here in South Africa and  internationally,  and  takes  place
after thorough consultations.  The  new  body  will,  in  future,  recognise
learner achievements  and  award  qualifications,  certificates  or  credits
towards a National Qualifications Framework qualification.

Its  scope  will  be  limited  to   programmes   offered   by   institutions
established, declared or registered under the  South  African  Schools  Act,
the Further Education and Training Act or  the  Adult  Basic  Education  and
Training Act. This body will not affect other quality  assurance  bodies  or
processes in regard to programmes offered outside of these institutions.  In
addition, the new body will have the power to delegate  and  assign  any  of
its duties to other bodies with the  capacity  to  assist,  while  remaining
primarily responsible for quality assurance in the two bands.

The  sector  education  and  training  authorities  -  the  Setas  -  a  new
development in South  Africa,  will  come  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the
Minister of Labour. The Setas will therefore  continue  to  play  a  quality
assurance role in respect of programmes offered by  employers  and  training
agencies within the economic sector. We have to  look  at  the  relationship
between the Seta's work, and, for example, continuing education  leading  to
higher education. The SA Qualifications Authority, Saqa,  will  maintain  an
oversight of quality assurance across all bands of the NQF.

I ask the hon members not to be  put  off  by  the  existence  of  different
bodies. It would be a bureaucratic nightmare to have a single body, to  have
quality assurance for all of these.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Minister Asmal, I wonder perhaps  if  we  could
ask you to again move forward. I do apologise. We will be  refurbishing  the
National Council and we will have a whole new system  in  place  early  next
year, but this is ...

The MINISTER: Madam, Chairperson, I thought you were going to  build  a  new
Council altogether.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I think we may ask Minister  Manuel  for  that.
[Laughter.]

The MINISTER: Well, thank you very  much.  I  was  saying  that  it  is  not
possible to have a single body  dealing  with  the  whole  area  of  quality
assurance, because it is too complex, very  extensive  in  its  application,
and having discrete and different  bodies,  therefore,  is  the  appropriate
way.

One of the major tasks of the new body, as detailed  in  Chapter  3  of  the
Bill, will be the accreditation of providers, both public and private.  Once
the criteria for accreditation have  been  established  and  the  policy  in
respect  of  such  criteria  has  been  determined  by  me,  all  providers,
including provincial departments of education, will be  required  to  comply
with such criteria or face sanctions.

In the case of a provincial department, the education MEC will  be  required
to give a detailed report to the Minister on why they have not done  so.  In
the case of a private provider, the accreditation may be  refused.  That  is
very important, because at this level, in particular general  education  and
training, there are more  fly-by-nights  than  in  any  particular  area  in
education. This is a real first  attempt.  It  will  be  very  difficult  to
control these private providers. One sees them  all  over  the  place,  even
next  to  the  Department  of  Education  in  Schoeman   Street,   providing
instruction, particularly in computers.

These are powerful instruments and strongly in the interests of the  public.
I expect that the national and provincial departments will work  closely  to
ensure that the process is smooth and efficient. I regret to  say  that  the
new body is designated as the General and  Further  Education  and  Training
Quality Assurance Council, otherwise to be known, regrettably, as  Genfetqa,
an accurate if rather lengthy description of its functions.  We  have  tried
very hard, in fact, we offered many prizes - money prizes -  to  identify  a
shorter title, but failed. Once this Bill is approved, I  will  be  inviting
nominations, especially  from  organisations  involved  in  education,  from
which I will appoint 15 persons, including a chairperson. I ask hon  members
to be involved in this nomination process.

These appointments will take into account representivity in the  sector  and
consideration of  expertise,  knowledge  and  experience  of  the  different
nominees. Let me  be  quite  clear:  I  want  maximum  participation  in  an
efficient, professional body that can properly  tackle  the  task  at  hand.
Membership of this body must be seen as part of public service, in the  best
tradition of voluntary activity. Gold-diggers and those seeking  alternative
employment need not apply for appointment, and this is very important.

On Friday, of course, we shall be  looking,  when  we  look  at  the  Budget
Review, at aspects of principle. I hope we will tease out, for example,  how
education functions are being carried out at present - this is  immutable  -
and whether local government, in particular  metropolitan  councils,  should
not be playing a bigger part in  education.  I  hope  we  will  be  able  to
discuss this as a matter of principle, rather than simply responding to  two
Bills here.

I believe that the  country  is  more  than  ready  for  the  rigours  of  a
systematic quality assurance programme. We have been improving  our  results
over the past year, and we hope to do so again, particularly at  the  bottom
end  of  this  year.  These  achievements  have  been  the  result   of   an
uncompromising stance on the commitment of  teachers  and  officials  and  a
close monitoring of outcomes. The Genfetqa Council, if hon members  approve,
will be another tool  which  will  prepare  our  education  system  and  our
students and learners for the 21st century, as I promised the  President  on
taking office.

I am delighted  to  record  that,  except  for  minor  amendments,  all  the
provinces have indicated support for the draft  legislation  in  recognition
of its purpose and its ability to improve  quality  in  education.  I  thank
them very much. As the Department of  Education,  together  with  provincial
departments of education, we are placing ourselves  before  the  public  and
establishing a structure which will  report  to  them  on  our  performance.
This, I must say, is a brave move, but we owe  it  to  the  public.  We  are
confident that in working with this council we will continue to improve  the
quality of education at general and further levels.

The second piece of legislation is  an  amending  Bill,  which  makes  minor
textual  changes  to  the  Employment  of  Educators  Act  and  the  Further
Education and Training Act. The main substantive  change  is  to  the  South
African Schools Act, where the implementation of  the  Act  has  shown  some
rather unfortunate gaps. Perhaps the most dramatic  demonstration  of  these
has been the former principal of Ermelo Hoërskool, who is  alleged  to  have
diverted significant amounts from the school funds  into  his  own  pockets.
Regrettably, we know he is not alone in this, and we have tried  to  address
this serious problem, among other concerns.

The amendments therefore deal with three areas: firstly, the status  of  the
representative  council  of  learners  as  against  other  student   bodies;
secondly, the functioning of the school governing bodies; and  thirdly,  the
management of funds of the schools.

In respect of learner bodies, the legislation makes more explicit  what  was
intended in the South African Schools Act - that the representative  council
of learners should be ``the only recognised and legitimate learner  body  at
the school''.

We have espoused democracy as the form of  representation  in  society,  and
schools are not exempt from this. However, in  too  many  instances  another
body, most often a prefect body, which is  not  democratically  elected,  is
put forward as a group representing learners.

This amendment  does  not  outlaw  prefects.  It  is  up  to  the  province.
Mpumalanga, in its wisdom, has outlawed prefects in the  schools  from  next
year. It merely seeks to ensure that they are understood in  their  rightful
place. Prefects are  usually  an  arm  of  the  management  of  the  school.
Prefects are often appointed by the school, and serve a  different  function
from the council of learners. Similarly, other  bodies,  including  national
student organisations such as Cosas and Azasco, may still be  encouraged  at
school, but they should also not confused with the real  representatives  of
all  the  learners.  These  bodies  like  Azasco  and  Cosas  are  voluntary
organisations, whose mandates and accountabilities lie elsewhere.

Young people are entitled to have their views represented by peers of  their
choice. Why some schools tend to downgrade this is not clear  to  me.  These
representative councils are consultative bodies. As I have  said  again  and
again, they do not run the school, but many difficulties would  be  overcome
if the school authorities  listened  to  legitimate  grievances  brought  to
their attention by these learner councils.

As regards the functioning of governing bodies, the Council  knows  that  we
have the most far-reaching  governing  body  system  anywhere  that  I  have
studied. I am astonished that when we passed this legislation  in  1996,  we
gave such enormous powers to the  governing  bodies.  It  has  become  quite
apparent that many governing bodies are not fulfilling  their  functions  in
terms of the law. In some cases this is due to a lack of  capacity,  and  we
are working very hard to build this capacity  in  a  number  of  programmes,
particularly with the establishment of a more representative association  of
school governing bodies.

Regrettably, others have demonstrated a  wilful  neglect  of  their  duties,
with the aim of frustrating the  professional  management  of  a  school  or
provincial department. This cannot  be  tolerated,  particularly  when  such
governing bodies try to usurp the functions  of  the  principal  or  try  to
dismiss the principal or  teachers.  Therefore  this  cannot  be  tolerated,
given  the  enormous  powers  which  school  governing  bodies   have   been
allocated.

We have therefore made provision, where a governing body ceases  to  perform
all or some of its functions, for the head of the  department  of  education
of the province to be empowered to intervene, either by the  appointment  of
a person to fulfil the neglected functions, or by insisting on the  election
of a new governing body. At the same time, we have  committed  ourselves  to
building capacity where there is a need for this and a willingness  to  meet
the responsibilities. I trust this approach will be  strongly  supported.  I
hope members, as I have appealed before, will play their part  in  assisting
governing bodies in their own localities.

The final aspect we deal with is the utilisation of the  school  fund.  Now,
of course, as we know, in theory, school funds were  set  up  to  supplement
the grant from the state. But in many of the schools,  the  school  fund  is
particularly important. I am referring in particular to the poorer schools.

We have discovered that many schools, especially those  which  are  able  to
collect substantial fees from the parents, have been  hiding  some  of  this
fee income in trusts established by the school.

This is, of course, completely untenable, because the essence of a trust  is
that it removes accountability  from  the  parents  to  a  select  group  of
trustees. The school fund is  a  property  interest  of  the  parents.  They
contribute to it. So if we remove the accountability from the parents  to  a
select group of trustees, they may at any stage, without the consent of  the
school, amend the purposes of the trust and use it for their  own  or  other
people's enrichment or for other purposes, however noble they may  be,  that
are not related to the functioning of the school.

Some schools have done so under the mistaken belief that to contribute to  a
trust brings about certain tax  advantages.  I  am  happy  to  say  that  my
colleague the Minister of Finance, last year at my request, determined  that
any financial contribution to a school, be it public or independent, is  tax
exempt. Therefore there is  no  need  for  such  trusts.  I  have  therefore
proposed in the Bill that money from the school fund of a public school  may
not be paid into a trust or be used to establish a trust, and I call on  the
House to support this.

School fees are public moneys. They must remain in the public  domain  under
the scrutiny of the school governing body and thereby that of  the  parents.
The school governing  body  is  also  required  to  submit  its  budget  and
financial reports to the provincial department. Moneys which may  have  been
paid into trusts already will have to be repaid into the school fund.

I might add that this provision does not preclude a private  association  of
parents or other interested parties from establishing a trust of  which  the
beneficiary is the school. They can continue to do so. This is  outside  the
domain of our legislation, and would be a private  arrangement  between  the
trustees. Most importantly, money collected by such a  trust  would  not  be
public money. Many parents have actually approached me  to  say  they  would
like to bring young blacks into the school  and  set  up  a  trust  fund  to
assist them with their school fees. This approach is not affected  by  that.
They can set up a separate trust fund which  has  nothing  to  do  with  the
school fees.

A final amendment to the Further Education and Training Act deals  with  the
provision  of  loans  and  overdrafts  to  further  education  and  training
institutions. Again there is a mischief  to  be  cured.  Only  the  MEC  for
education in a province is  now  empowered  to  approve  a  loan  overdraft.
Without such approval, the state and the institution will not be liable  for
that debt. At present the position is unclear, namely that  schools  do  run
debts and get loans. This  will  therefore  send  a  cautionary  message  to
lending institutions, and  the  schools  and  colleges  will  in  future  be
obliged to work within their budgets,  except  for  major  or  unanticipated
expenses, where the member of the executive council  might  have  reason  to
approve a loan or overdraft.

I end by saying that these  amendments  are  all  intended  to  bring  about
greater clarity. They are  really  merely  shopkeeping  amendments,  by  and
large, to clarify and tidy up things and do  not  introduce  any  departures
from our policy, or from the  original  purposes  of  the  Acts  which  they
amend.  I  hope  hon  members  will  appreciate  the   need   for   constant
improvements to the legislation, based on  our  experience  of  implementing
it.

The  move  from  a  state-controlled  education  system  to  one  in   which
significant governance responsibilities are  placed  in  the  hands  of  the
communities is, in principle, a good one. Let me say this quite clearly.  We
are in fact lessening the control of  the  state  as  far  as  education  is
concerned, rather  than  increasing  it.  We  will  not  deviate  from  that
principle because it  was  a  principle  of  the  ANC  -  not  the  idea  of
subsidiarity, but local control. Local control  is  very  important.  It  is
very much part of our three spheres working together.

Taken together the two Bills have a contribution  to  make  towards  better-
quality schools  and  colleges,  which  are  more  effectively  managed  and
governed. This is in  the  interests  of  everyone,  and  I  therefore  have
pleasure  in  tabling  them  for  members'   consideration   and   approval.
[Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon  MECs  and  hon  members,  the
South African Schools Act, which  was  passed  in  1996,  is  our  country's
blueprint for the fundamental restructuring of our public education  system.
Like all other restructuring processes, the transformation of our  education
system is a difficult process, and issues may crop  up  from  time  to  time
which we did not foresee at the time we enacted the  South  African  Schools
Act.

Many of these issues are not merely incidental  to,  but  form  an  integral
part of, the visions we set out in the South African Schools Act. If  we  do
not make provision for the inclusion of such issues in the Act, we  may  not
be able to implement our vision of greater equity in the  education  system,
and of more effective and financially sound public schools.

The Education Laws Amendment Bill contains some of these  important  issues,
which are fundamental to the implementation of the above  vision.  It  seeks
to fill some of the gaps that were left  open  when  we  drafted  the  South
African Schools Act,  the  Employment  of  Educators  Act  and  the  Further
Education and Training Act.

The need for some of these amendments had been  highlighted  by  the  recent
revelation of corruption and misspending in some of our public schools.  For
the reason that public schools are funded from  public  money,  it  is  then
important that all learners must  benefit  from  this  money  received  from
them, and that it should not be used selectively  to  benefit  only  certain
learners.

In the absence of strict guidelines on  the  application  of  public  school
funds, it is quite possible for those who do not care  about  the  wellbeing
of our public education system to misappropriate these funds for  their  own
personal gain or for those who want to perpetuate  past  privileges  to  use
the funds for the benefit of only certain learners.

Indeed, a tendency has developed of public  schools  having  different  bank
accounts, some of which are in the name  of  structures  without  any  legal
personality. There is a real danger in this because it  can  potentially  be
used to hide money  and  distort  the  actual  financial  situation  of  the
school, when compulsory school fees are determined.

This amending Bill is an attempt to prevent the above situation.  It  places
an obligation on school governing bodies  to  open  and  maintain  a  single
banking  account  and  empowers  the  MEC  to  approve  or  disapprove   the
investment of surplus money in another account.

It is not only through the creation of different banking accounts  that  the
financial position of public schools can be undermined.  The  entering  into
of loan  or  overdraft  agreements  also  has  the  potential  to  seriously
jeopardise the financial position of public schools, because the state  will
be liable to compensate  for  claims  against  public  schools  where  these
schools default in terms of their loan or overdraft agreements. It is  quite
possible that this fact can be exploited by certain public schools.  It  may
even lead to the bizarre situation in which our democratic  Government  will
be obliged to pay for the entrenchment of white privileges.

A previously advantaged public school which has  not  made  any  attempt  to
integrate  previously  disadvantaged  learners  could  enter  into  a   loan
agreement. If they cannot repay the loan, the state will have to  carry  out
this responsibility and, in this way,  will  pay  for  the  entrenchment  of
white privilege.

Similarly, a loan agreement can  be  concluded  and  its  proceeds  used  to
benefit only certain learners at a public school. If  schools  cannot  repay
the loan, the state will then be liable and, in this way,  again  be  forced
to assist those certain learners.

In terms of the Education  Laws  Amendment  Bill,  public  schools  will  no
longer have the power to enter into a loan or  overdraft  agreement  without
the written permission of the MECs. Where they enter into such an  agreement
without the approval of the MECs, the state will no  longer  be  responsible
to compensate for claims against the public school.

These amendments are crucial to  sustain  the  financial  wellbeing  of  our
public schools and need to be supported  by  all  those  who  are  seriously
concerned about our public education system.

The General and Further Education and Training  Quality  Assurance  Bill  is
another important brick in the foundation that we  are  laying  in  ensuring
the highest quality of  education  in  our  country.  Quality  assurance  is
important to ensure that general education and further  education  meet  the
needs of learners,  communities,  employers  and  society  as  a  whole.  It
provides a means of measuring  our  programmes  and  qualifications  against
world-class standards.

This is particularly important in this new era of  globalisation,  in  which
continuous and quality improvements are  vital  to  ensure  relevance  in  a
dynamically changing and globally competitive  world.  It  is  a  fact  that
quality is driven from within organisations and  institutions.  The  primary
responsibility  for  quality  assurance  therefore  lies  with  general  and
further education and training providers themselves.

However, I believe that  quality  assurance  requires  external  validation.
This Bill will provide a mechanism for external validation  of  general  and
further education and training quality assurance  through  the  creation  of
the General and Further Education and Training Quality Assurance Council.

This council will replace the existing SA Certification Council, which is  a
leftover of apartheid education. Its main functions will be to accredit  all
providers of general  and  further  education  and  training,  to  recognise
learners' achievements and award credits towards  qualifications  registered
on the National Qualifications Framework, and  to  issue  the  certificates.
[Applause.]

Mr B J TOLO (Mpumalanga):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  MECs
present here and all other members, a salient feature of the  South  African
education system up to 1994 was the existence  of  insensitive  language  in
some  provisions  of  its  Acts,  which  are  either  obsolete,  not  gender
sensitive or not user-friendly.

Soon after the advent of democracy, our Government, through  the  Department
of Education,  announced  its  intentions  to  transform  the  institutional
landscape of education with a noble vision and great zeal.  This  vision  is
given further  impetus  today  with  the  tabling  of  the  General  Further
Education and Training Quality Assurance Bill in this House.

We are convinced that this is a noble goal promised on  the  ideals  of  the
collective needs of all the learners at the various exit points  of  further
education and training in this  country.  Obviously,  in  our  endeavour  to
realise this noble goal, we are bound to incur the  wrath  of  some  of  the
opposition parties, whose vocabulary is riddled with terms like,  ``lowering
of standards'', ``compromising of quality'', and so on.

One such party is the undemocratic DA, especially here in the Western  Cape,
through its MEC of education, the hon Helen Zille,  who  is  fortunately  in
this House today. On Sunday, 30 September 2001, the Sunday  Argus  published
an article in which the hon MEC slammed  the  proposed  provisions  of  this
Bill.

She is quoted as saying that this province - the Western  Cape,  that  is  -
will not accept single national senior certificate  exams  unless  they  are
benchmarked on the Scottish Qualifications Authority. She went on to say:


  The Scottish Qualifications Authority is the best in the  world,  and  we
  reserve the right to withdraw unless the Minister gives the  undertaking.
  Without this, the Western Cape cannot move towards a  single  examination
  and retain the confidence of our  good  public  schools  and  independent
  schools.

She goes on to say that this will compromise the  quality  of  education  in
the Western Cape. In  the  same  article,  an  anonymous  parent,  obviously
belonging to the same school of thought as the hon MEC, said that  he  would
not like his children to write the same exam  as  children  in  the  Eastern
Cape or the Northern Province, because their  certificates  were  not  worth
the paper they were written on.

We must indicate  that  we  are  assured  by  the  department  that  it  has
consulted extensively on this Bill. And by the way, it  has  consulted  with
the very same Scottish and Canadian quality  authorities.  Of  course,  this
Bill is testimony to that process and one needs to commend the department.

This Department of Education and the ANC-led Government will not and  should
not be derailed and  distracted  by  those  people  like  the  hon  MEC  for
education in the Western Cape, who are clearly nostalgic about the past.  We
should not be distracted by those who want to cling to the advantages  of  a
tiny minority over the majority of the citizens of this country.

The Bill also sees the SA Certification Council replaced by a  new  council,
the General and Further Education and Training  Quality  Assurance  Council.
This is necessitated by the fact that Safcert dates back  to  the  apartheid
days and transformation is necessary. The new body will contribute  a  great
deal towards eroding the  inherited  inequalities  and  provide  advancement
through access to equity  and  opportunity.  Apart  from  its  duties  as  a
quality assurance  provider  for  the  general  and  further  education  and
training bands,  it  will  also  ensure  efficient,  effective  and  optimal
utilisation of our scarce resources.

Maybe the hon MEC Zille should  channel  her  energies  towards  encouraging
those who are harbouring racial prejudices in her  party  to  abandon  their
racial spleen and start to  celebrate  the  efforts  of  the  Government  in
making  this  country  a  better  place  for  all.  Her  utterances  further
strengthen our belief that a leopard cannot change its spots, but  can  only
change from spot to spot.

Education is a  cornerstone  and  a  prerequisite  for  development  in  our
country and indeed in any country in the world. This is so because a  school
is a nursery to shape the  world  outlook  of  individuals.  If  this  world
outlook is not shaped while the minds are young and pliable, it might  be  a
mission impossible when  the  minds  are  old  and  rigid.  Prior  to  1994,
education in our country was used not to produce balanced citizens aware  of
their patriotic duties, but to produce, especially amongst Africans,  hewers
of wood and drawers of water.

The advent of democracy in our country  therefore  meant  bringing  about  a
revolution in education, a revolution that would  fundamentally  change  the
education system in this country. The South African Schools  Act  and  other
relevant Acts then and the Education Laws Amendment Bill debated  today  are
all meant to advance that revolution. We will do so  despite  the  screaming
and kicking of those wanting to cling to the past. We will drag  them  along
into the bright future of education in this country.

The South African Schools Act introduced for the first time the  concept  of
school governing bodies in our schools. The SGBs  are  the  most  democratic
structures that have ever been involved in the governance  of  our  schools.
For the first time  in  the  history  of  this  country  we  have  statutory
structures in our schools  that  represent  all  role-players  in  a  school
situation.  Students  as  represented  in  the  SGBs  are  no  longer   just
recipients  of  instructions  from  the  school's  principal  but  can   now
participate in the shaping of their own destiny. Parents  and  teachers  are
important stakeholders and are now also involved in the  governance  of  the
schools. This is democracy in its purest form.

The only snag, which I think is subjective, is the fact  that  we  have  had
some small shortcomings here and there. The Education  Laws  Amendment  Bill
seeks to address some of those shortcomings. The experience of the past  few
years shows that the main problem with SGBs was capacity.  The  law  demands
that after their election  the  SGBs  must  be  capacitated.  The  level  of
development of communities in our country, like anywhere else,  is  not  the
same. SGBs in the affluent  areas  have  performed  relatively  better  than
those in the rural areas. We have had situations where SGBs, due to  a  lack
of understanding of their duties, and especially in the rural areas,  strove
to exceed their mandates, whilst in other areas we have  had  them  dictated
to by the principals. All these anomalies happen when these bodies  are  not
properly empowered. The Education Laws Amendment Bill  makes  it  compulsory
for the departments of education in the provinces  to  empower  SGBs  to  be
equipped to do their tasks. We want to further  urge  that  in  capacitating
these bodies  the  provincial  education  departments  must  apply  positive
discrimination in favour of the rural areas, because the  need  is  greatest
in those areas.
To illustrate what happens when an SGB is not capacitated, I would  like  to
go into a little detail as to what actually  happened  in  Ermelo.  This  is
from an article in the Sunday  Times,  30  September  2001,  entitled  ``The
worst headmaster in the land''.  This  headmaster,  Koos  Kruger,  used  the
school fees to pay for  his  Mercedes-Benz  180  C  class.  [Interjections.]
Unfortunately he is from Mpumalanga. [Interjections.]

This headmaster paid for his booze with school money, he went  out  to  dine
with school fees, he went to casinos with that money and we  are  also  told
that he paid his domestic servant with  the  school  fees.  Over  and  above
that, this very principal refused a  student  a  bursary  of  R2  760,  just
because that student was black. This is racism at its best.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: That is not true. [Interjections.]

Mr B J TOLO (MPUMALANGA): Now, we are therefore saying that we believe  that
if the SGB in that school had been  capacitated  and  functioning  properly,
these serious irregularities would not have  happened  or  would  have  been
detected in time. [Time expired.]

Ms O H ZILLE (Western Cape): Chairperson, Minister,  MECs,  colleagues,  hon
members, including the hon Mr Tolo, I do not think that I am going to  spend
any of my precious time  commenting  on  Mr  Tolo,  because  he  is  clearly
speaking on issues that he knows very little about  and  are  irrelevant  to
the Bills before us, in large measure.

I do welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and  I  will  begin  on
the Education Laws Amendment Bill. I would like to start by  commending  the
process by which this Bill took shape. It was a  participative  process  and
provinces' inputs were taken seriously. We were given various  opportunities
to state our case, and  in  some  instances  -  important  instances  -  the
amendments to the Bill showed that we  had  been  listened  to.  We  greatly
value this and would like to place our appreciation on record.

Our Constitution stipulates the right to a  basic  education  for  everyone.
When it comes to turning that right into reality, we  come  up  against  the
stark realisation of just how basic the education  is  that  the  state  can
afford to offer each child. For this reason we rely  a  great  deal  on  the
contributions of parents to help Government to  lift  public  schools  above
the level of basic and assist us in our quest for excellence in  all  public
schools.

We believe in redistribution and have implemented the national  department's
norms and standards for the funding  of  schools  with  great  determination
and, I may say, success. This system allocates seven times more  funding  in
key categories to the poorest schools in  comparison  with  the  least  poor
schools - with a sliding scale in between.

In addition, we encourage all contributions by parents, and I am pleased  to
report that their involvement in schools is, in many cases, growing.

This  involvement  has  sometimes,  unfortunately,   been   accompanied   by
financial malpractices, although I have not found too many Koos  Krugers  in
this province, I am pleased to say.

We are determined to ensure that all moneys raised by a school are used  for
the children's educational interests, and we have taken concerted  steps  to
end malpractices and root out all forms of corruption. We  believe  that  we
already have all the  measures  we  need  to  stamp  out  corruption.  I  am
surprised that Mr Koos Kruger is not in jail. I am sure that if he  were  in
this province, if a case against him could  be  proved,  and  after  a  fair
trial, he would be in jail if he were found guilty. [Interjections.]

Our forensic audit teams have achieved significant success,  and  of  course
success breeds success. Parents and  teachers  report  malpractice,  knowing
that if they do, we will send our forensic audit teams  and  something  will
be done. The word is  out  throughout  this  province  that  corruption  and
malpractices will be detected, and that  is  the  first  essential  step  to
curbing such practices.

However, the  vast  majority  of  our  schools  are  not  corrupt,  and  the
increasing involvement of parents has  been  enormously  beneficial  to  the
public school system. The benefits have far  outweighed  the  disadvantages,
and we have all the laws we currently need to stamp out corruption  wherever
we find it. We are therefore concerned by the general trend, also  evidenced
in this Bill, for the state to curb  the  scope  of  school  communities  to
deliver the resources and input required to  build  the  excellence  of  all
public schools.

We understand what malpractices these  measures  seek  to  prevent,  and  we
support this objective, but we do not believe that  measures  to  deal  with
the corrupt  few  should  be  applied  in  a  way  that  could  shackle  the
creativity of the honest majority  in  raising  funds  and  investing  those
funds in the interest of education.

These prohibitions  have  been  ameliorated  somewhat  by  the  Bill  making
provision for the MEC to grant a school permission to enter into  loans  and
overdrafts, or to open another account,  where  appropriate.  This  puts  an
enormous  responsibility  on  all  MECs  to  be  efficient  and  prompt   in
responding to such requests to avoid serious inconvenience  to  the  schools
involved. I will support a time deadline to  be  included  in  the  relevant
clause to ensure that MECs apply their minds and respond promptly.

However, we must reiterate our concern about  the  retrospective  nature  of
the clause in the Bill relating to trusts, particularly  the  fact  that  it
applies without any time limit. Many schools have operated trust  funds  for
decades, perfectly legally and without any corruption or ulterior motives.

We know that in the application of South African  law,  our  courts  make  a
presumption against retrospectivity, unless it is expressly stated. In  this
Bill it is expressly stated, but gives rise to  serious  uncertainties.  For
example: How far back will this retrospectivity apply? What happens  to  the
rights and obligations of currently lawful trusts and assets they  may  own?
What happens, for example, if funds from a trust are  used  to  purchase  or
develop a fixed asset, such as a school hall? The building obviously  cannot
be returned to the school fund.

In all such instances our law requires that the clause  be  given  its  most
restrictive  and  limited  interpretation.  We  are  concerned   about   the
unresolved issues and unintended  consequences  this  clause  is  likely  to
engender.

In terms of this Bill, which will be  law  before  the  start  of  the  2002
school year, many routine procedures of financial administration, which  are
perfectly legal now, will become illegal. We  strongly  believe  that  there
should be a six-month phasing-in period for schools to adjust their  systems
and procedures to comply with the provisions  of  this  Bill.  Most  schools
have completed their budgetary processes for 2002, and need time  to  adjust
well-established practices to the new reality.

Another area of concern is the evidence  in  this  Bill  that  the  national
department continues its tendency to  centralise  controls  and  remove  the
discretion of the MEC to determine what is  best  for  local  circumstances.
[Interjections.] With federal aspects!

An example of this to be found in the section of  the  Bill  which  requires
the MEC to determine the functions and the procedures for the  establishment
and election of representative councils of learners, subject to policy  made
in terms of the National Education Policy Act.  There  is  little  point  in
giving an MEC discretion, only to curb such discretion in  line  with  quite
narrowly  defined  criteria.  The  possible  implications  of   the   recent
Constitutional  Court  judgment,  for  the  extent  to  which  the  National
Education  Policy  Act  can  determine  procedures  that  are   binding   on
provinces, will also have to be carefully  studied.  We  will  examine  this
clause in the light of that judgment.

One final area of concern we  have  with  this  clause  is  that  clause  4,
relating to governing bodies, still does not enable  provincial  departments
to deal with individual governing body members who  misuse  their  positions
and disrupt the functioning of schools. The clause  deals  effectively,  and
we welcome it, with the problem of governing bodies  that  are  collectively
dysfunctional. However, we believe our laws should make  provision  for  the
increasingly common situation in which individuals with hidden agendas  seek
to advance their individual interests, and not  the  school's,  using  their
position on governing bodies to do so. In some cases this results in  severe
conflict, and curbs the governing body in the exercise of its mandate.

Apart from these concerns, and some are  serious  concerns,  we  think  that
several amendments are constructive, and those we welcome.  However,  having
applied our minds very seriously indeed, we have considered  the  weaknesses
in this Bill sufficient cause to oppose it.

I will summarise briefly  what  these  reasons  are:  There  are  sufficient
currently available methods to stop malpractices and corruption in  a  small
minority of schools. We do not need another law that will  merely  curb  the
capacity of schools to help  the  state  raise  the  money  needed  to  fund
quality education in all schools.

Some very capable parents are beginning to withdraw from  governing  bodies,
because it is just too much work  in  an  increasingly  restrained  context.
Secondly, we believe there must be a phase-in period to prevent a  situation
where schools find they are guilty of breaking the law if  they  are  merely
continuing practices which up to now have been  perfectly  legal,  and  have
not abused their situations.

Thirdly, we oppose the  increasing  tendency  to  centralise  power  by  the
national  department.  We  must  apply  concurrent  powers  to  allow   MECs
discretion to apply law in appropriate ways to  suit  schools  in  different
situations, within provinces and between provinces.

However, it is our very great pleasure to support the  General  and  Further
Education and Training Quality Assurance Bill, generally referred to  by  us
as Genfetqa. The essence of the Bill is the establishment of a  General  and
Further Education and Training Quality Assurance Council that  will  replace
the SA Certification Council, and also  the  repeal  of  the  South  African
Certification Council Act of 1986.

We  extend  our  sincere  thanks,  along  with   the   Minister,   and   our
commendation,  to  the  SA  Certification  Council   for   its   exceptional
contribution over many years. The new council will perform the  role  of  an
education and training quality assurance body for the general education  and
training and the further  education  and  training  bands  on  the  National
Qualifications Framework in terms of the South  African  Qualifications  Act
of 1995.

The functions of the council include quality assurance, which would make  it
a  reactionary  Bill  according  to  Mr  Tolo,  and   the   assessment   and
certification of learners at GET and FET exit points.  [Interjections.]  The
composition  of  the  council  consists  of  15  members  appointed  by  the
Minister. The Minister  is  also  responsible,  through  the  invitation  of
nominations, for the appointment of the chairperson, as  well  as  the  CEO.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon  MECs,  hon  special  delegates,
hon colleagues, like the hon MEC who preceded me, I will not be  tempted  to
engage Mr Tolo in his disparaging remarks about  unsubstantiated  statements
attributed to Ms Zille. [Interjections.] However, I just want  to  pose  two
questions for Who Wants to be a Millionare?  Question  one:  Which  province
fiddled with the matriculation results: (a) Mpumalanga, (b) Mpumalanga,  (c)
Mpumalanga or (d) Mpumalanga? [Laughter.] Question two: The mampara  Kruger,
the principal ...

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, on a point of order:  I  would  like  to  know
whether the Mpumalanga exams have anything to do with this  particular  Bill
that is before us. The hon member is totally out of order.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Carry on, hon member.

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I did not finish  with  my  second  question.  The
mampara Kruger, to whom Mr Tolo referred, happened to  be  from  Mpumalanga.
He had both his hands and feet in the cookie jar and  nobody  was  watching.
So it was a bit  rich  for  the  delegate  from  Mpumalanga  to  make  self-
righteous statements on education.

The General and  Further  Education  and  Training  Quality  Assurance  Bill
proposes  the  establishment  of  the  General  and  Further  Education  and
Training Quality Assurance Council to replace the SA Certification  Council.
The proposed council will perform the role  of  an  education  and  training
quality assurance body for general and further education. The main  function
of the council is to be responsible for monitoring  and  auditing  education
and training achievements and systems commensurate with  national  standards
and qualifications.

It is well known that the  SA  Certification  Council  Act  of  1986  is  of
apartheid origin  and,  as  such,  was  neither  user-friendly  nor  gender-
friendly. And it was no surprise that the Department of Education  appointed
a  task  team  to  investigate,  develop  and  produce  a  suitable  quality
assurance model for the general  and  the  further  education  and  training
bands of the National Qualifications Framework.

The DP supports the Bill and fully  acknowledges  the  fact  that  the  Bill
provides for a smooth transition  before  it  becomes  a  wholly  registered
education and training quality assurance body  with  the  SA  Qualifications
Authority.
The Education Laws Amendment Bill, on  the  other  hand,  provides  for  the
amendment of the South African  Schools  Act  of  1996,  the  Employment  of
Educators Act of 1998 and the Further Education and Training  Act  of  1998.
Obviously, these pieces of legislation  had  loopholes  and  the  amendments
seek to plug them.

Let us examine the main objectives of the Bill. Firstly,  the  amendment  to
section 11 of  the  South  African  Schools  Act  1996  seeks  to  make  the
representative council  of  learners  the  only  recognised  and  legitimate
learner body at public schools. The MEC will determine the functions of  the
council. The prefect system, as we know it, will be history.

Secondly, the amendment to section 16 seeks to specify the functions of  the
governing body of a school. In other words, some powers of the SGB will,  as
a result, be curtailed.

Thirdly, section 36 is amended to prohibit the school  governing  body  from
applying  for  overdrafts  or  raising  money  by  means  of  loans  without
obtaining the prior approval of the MEC.
Fourthly, section 37 is amended to  make  it  clear  that  a  school  should
maintain one bank account only.

The Bill also prohibits the school governing body from establishing a  trust
from school funds or paying school fees into trust accounts. The  fact  that
trusts may lead to abuse is a valid concern. But to obviate  such  abuse,  a
preferred route would be for provincial heads of departments to monitor  and
oversee the management and administration  of  such  trusts.  In  any  case,
there is the recourse of the Auditor-General,  who  could  be  requested  to
undertake an audit of the  records  and  financial  statements  of  a  trust
administered by a  public  school  that  is  suspected  to  be  involved  in
malfeasance.

The denial of access to  financial  tools  such  as  loans,  overdrafts  and
trusts will be tantamount to pulling the plug of the lifeline  of  financial
viability of most schools.

Such denial will put especially the former Model C schools in  an  invidious
situation as they are destined to rely less on subsidies in comparison  with
public schools.

The DP sees the Education Laws Amendment Bill  as  sounding  the  the  death
knell of such schools, and therefore opposes the Bill. Surely the  financial
wellbeing  of  a  school  is  paramount  if  it  has  to   carry   out   its
constitutional  mandate  of  providing  optimum  quality  education  to  its
charges, unfettered by extraneous constraints.

Mev J WITBOOI: Voorsitter, agb Minister en agb lede, die Nuwe NP staan  voor
die Raad om ons teenstem teen die Wysigingswetsontwerp op Onderwyswette  aan
te teken. Hierdie wetsontwerp het dit ten doel  om  bepaalde  wysigings  aan
die Suid-Afrikaanse Skolewet  aan  te  bring  en  dit  is  met  van  hierdie
klousules waarmee ons wesenlike probleme het.

In klousule lui 1(b) dit soos volg:


  Subject to policy made in  terms  of  section  3(4)(g)  of  the  National
  Education Policy Act, 1096, the member of the executive Council must  ...
  determine the functions and procedures for the establishment and election
  of representative councils of learners.

Die Nuwe NP is van mening dat hierdie stukkie  wysiging  die  outonomie  van
enige lid van die uitvoerende komitee aan bande lê en  dat  dit  dui  op  'n
geneigdheid van die Minister om sentrale beheer uit te oefen. As daar  gekyk
word na wat in Wet 27 van 1996 staan en spesifiek in artikel 3(4)(g)  staan,
is  dit  duidelik  dat  daar  geen  ruimte  aan  LUKs  gebied  word  om  hul
provinsiale magte wat wel op papier staan, uitvoering te gee nie.

Hoewel die Nuwe NP met die wysiging in artikels 36(2) en (3) van Wet 84  van
1996 kan saamleef, is die bepaling dat die beheerliggame slegs  lenings  mag
aangaan met die goedkeuring van die LUKs, volgens  ons  nie  heeltemal  goed
deurdag  nie.  Vrae  ontstaan  onwillekeurig  by  ons:  Wat  gebeur  as   'n
gevaarlike situasie by 'n skool ontstaan, een  met  onmiddellike  finansiële
implikasies? Wat as die staat op daardie gegewe  oomblik  'n  prioriteitslys
het waarvan nie  afgewyk  kan  word  nie?  Moet  die  beheerliggaam  van  'n
betrokke skool verlief daarmee neem met 'n antwoord wat  as  volg  mag  lui:
Ons neem kennis van  die  probleem.  Ons  plaas  u  op  die  prioriteitslys.
Nodeloos om te sê, dat so 'n lys soms lank kan wees. Hierdie en  vele  ander
vrae sal mettertyd by almal van ons spook, en ek hoop dat in die  uitvoering
van gebeurlikhede soos hierdie, spoedeisend te werk gegaan sal word  om  die
nadele wat die wysiging mag inhou, te ondervang.
Die wysiging wat oor trustfondse handel, is vir die Nuwe  NP  onaanvaarbaar.
Dit moet egter kategories gestel word dat die Nuwe  NP  enige  misbruik  van
trustfondse deur skolebeheerrade nie goedpraat nie. En waar dit voorkom  dat
trustfondse anders as tot  voordeel  van  die  funksionering  van  'n  skool
aangewend word, dit summier gestop  moet  word.  Die  beëindiging  van  alle
trustfondse is vir ons onversoenbaar.

Gestel op 'n ouervergadering van 'n bepaalde  gemeenskap  word  besluit  dat
daar op 'n kollektiewe wyse geld geïn word, om 'n fonds  of  trust  te  stig
ten einde die skoolbeheerraad in  staat  te  stel  om  al  die  leerders  in
daardie skool ten beste te dien, hoe kan dit as onwettig geag word?  As  die
doelstelling van hierdie klousule tot die wetsontwerp is om besorgde  ouers,
toegewyde landsburgers wie se hande en harte oop is vir  alle  skole  in  'n
bepaalde skoolgemeenskap, se hand van uitreiking weg te klap word,  wil  die
Nuwe NP hom met iets so drakonies nie vereenselwig nie.

Die Nuwe NP vereenselwig hom met  die  General  and  Further  Education  and
Training  Quality  Assurance  Bill,  asook  die  doelstellings  daarvan   en
ondersteun dit  heelhartig.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mrs J WITBOOI: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members,  the  New  NP  is
standing before the Council to put on record our vote against the  Education
Laws Amendment  Bill.  The  objective  of  this  Bill  is  to  make  certain
amendments to the South African Schools Act and it is  with  some  of  these
clauses that we have real problems.

Clause 1(b) goes as follows:


  Subject to policy made in  terms  of  section  3(4)(g)  of  the  National
  Education Policy Act, 1996, the member of the Executive Council must  ...
  determine the functions and procedures for the establishment and election
  of representative councils of learners.

The New NP is of the view that this piece of amendment  curbs  the  autonomy
of any member of the executive council and that it points to a  tendency  of
the Minister to exercise central control. When one looks at what Act  27  of
1996 says, and specifically section 3(4)(g), it  is  clear  that  MEC's  are
left no room to give effect to those of their provincial powers that are  in
fact on paper.

Although the New NP could live with the amendments of section 36(2) and  (3)
of Act 84 of 1996, the provision that the governing bodies  may  only  enter
into loans with the approval of the MECs is in our view  not  entirely  well
considered. Questions involuntarily  arise  among  us:  What  happens  if  a
dangerous situation  arises  at  a  school,  one  with  immediate  financial
implications? What if the state at that given moment  has  a  priority  list
from which it may not deviate? Should the governing  body  of  any  relevant
school be satisfied with a reply that might go as follows: We take  note  of
the problem. We are placing you on the priority list? Needless to say,  such
a list could sometimes be a long one. These  and  other  questions  will  in
time start haunting all of us and we hope that speedy action will  be  taken
in the case of events such as these to limit  the  detrimental  effect  that
this amendment may have.

The amendment in respect of trust funds is unacceptable to the  New  NP.  It
should be stated categorically, however, that the New NP  does  not  approve
of any abuse of trust  funds  by  school  governing  bodies.  And  where  it
appears that trust funds  are  used  other  than  for  the  benefit  of  the
functioning of a school, it should be stopped summarily.  Ending  all  trust
funds is irreconcilable to us.

Say that a certain community decides on parents' evening that money will  be
collected in a collective manner to establish a fund or trust fund in  order
to enable the school governing body best to serve all the learners  in  that
school, how could it be deemed to be  illegal?  If  the  objective  of  this
clause of the Bill is to slap away the  extended  hand  of  caring  parents,
dedicated citizens whose hands and hearts are  open  to  all  schools  in  a
certain school community, the New NP does not want to associate itself  with
something that draconian.

The New NP associates itself with the  General  and  Further  Education  and
Training Quality Assurance Bill, as well as its objectives, and supports  it
wholeheartedly. [Applause.]]

Umntwana  B  Z  ZULU:  Ngqongqoshe   wezemFundo   nomKhandlu   ohloniphekile

[Prince B Z ZULU: Minister of Education, and the NCOP, since  the  ANC  came
into power in 1994 it has faced the challenge  of  making  South  Africa  an
acceptable home to all its citizens without  discriminating  against  people
on the basis of their colour. The Department of  Education  has  made  major
progress in the challenges that it faces, such as  improving  the  level  of
education, skills and equality in the education system.

The success of the department in fulfilling its clear policies and aims  was
made possible by introducing a new programme in 2000. This programme is  not
there just to produce highly educated people, but also to ensure  that  they
have high-quality knowledge in a developing world.

Most institutions teaching skills, that  we  inherited  from  the  apartheid
government, had an expiring work programme. These  institutions  were  built
on the foundation of apartheid. The system that I am talking about  here  is
the one that haunted the people of South Africa for a long time.

The structure  of  the  system  that  operated  in  those  institutions  was
designed in a way  that  discouraged  the  development  of  the  mind  of  a
student. A student did not get the courage to improve and  prepare  for  his
future so that he could be serious  in  this  world  in  which  progress  in
technology takes place quickly.

The Department of Education has managed to solve most of the  problems  that
were created by apartheid. One of  the  problems  that  the  department  has
resolved was the redeployment of 30 000  teachers  in  new  positions  where
they were needed most.

This job was done successfully since not a single  teacher  was  retrenched.
This Department of Education has worked  successfully  in  improving  matric
results last year by 90% as compared to the previous year's results.
This improvement was noticed in all nine  provinces  of  South  Africa.  The
department has used thousands of millions of rands to  buy  study  aids  for
students at schools. It has also managed to make progress in  ensuring  that
the school development  programme  functioned  equally  under  the  National
Norms and Standards for School Funding. This means that those  schools  that
are in dire need of money will get 5%  more  that  those  that  have  enough
money.

South Africa  has  a  large  number  of  students  in  schools  compared  to
developed countries.

Another thing that was noticed was the increase  in  the  number  of  female

Ms CS BOTHA: Chairperson,  on  a  point  of  order:  Are  there  translation
facilities?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! We do not seem to  have  them  at  the
moment. I am trying to verify this.

Ms C S BOTHA: Chairperson, there is a problem, however, because  the  speech
was indicated as being in English. I do  not  see  an  indication  that  any
other vernacular was going to be used, so we need a translation, please.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  If  the  member  has  the  speech  in
English and is prepared to speak in another language  I  would  ask  him  to
continue but if not, I will reschedule his speech and  go  on  to  the  next
member. Hon member Zulu, are you prepared to do that? [Interjections.] I  am
talking to the hon member Zulu, and he is only one person.

Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson, no.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, with  due  respect  then  I  will
reschedule your speech and go on to the next member.

Ms B D CREECY (Gauteng): Chairperson, hon Minister, MECs and  colleagues  in
the NCOP, the Gauteng province welcomes the two proposed Bills  as  amended.
It is our view that  these  Bills  contribute  to  the  ongoing  process  of
transforming the education system in our country and  to  promoting  access,
equity, transparency and quality.

I want to start with the Education Laws Amendment Bill. There  has  been  an
attempt here this afternoon by some of the hon members of the opposition  to
sow seeds of panic around this Bill. They have claimed  that  it  undermines
the principle of partnership between school committees and the  state.  They
have also said that it limits the functions of the school  governing  bodies
and suggest that  these  might  be  usurped  by  the  MEC  or  the  national
Minister.

They suggest that school governing bodies will be left with fundraising  and
managerial obligations, but with no legal capacity and that  the  result  of
this will be to destroy the  willingness  of  school  communities  to  raise
independent funds. Hon member Witbooi  even  suggested  that  private  trust
funds will not be allowed at all anymore.

I think it is important to set a  few  matters  straight.  It  is  this  ANC
Government which has generalised to all schools and entrenched  in  law  the
partnership of school governing bodies and the state. [Interjections.]  This
same Government has extended this partnership to the point at  which  school
governing bodies may apply for section 21 status in terms of  the  Companies
Act, so that they can  more  effectively  pursue  governance  of  their  own
schools.
School communities are juristic persons. Section 21 is the Companies Act,  I
would like to say to hon Zille. They are therefore in a  position  to  raise
school fees and other  funds  for  the  benefit  of  the  school.  The  2000
amendments to the Income Tax Act allow individuals and companies  to  donate
to schools to receive a tax  benefit.  I  think  this  has  been  adequately
portrayed to us once again this afternoon by the hon the Minister. What  the
Bill explicitly prevents is the transfer of fees  or  donations  already  in
the school fund to independent trusts. It does not  prevent  any  individual
or any group of individuals outside of the school community from setting  up
trusts, which can benefit that school or any other school.  [Interjections.]
Yes, you did.

Every parent has the right to know what money  has  been  collected  by  the
school governing body, and has the right to a say in how it is  spent.  This
proviso is contained in the Bill and it  is  entrenched  in  the  provisions
that insist that school governing bodies must draw up annual  budgets.  This
is not some draconian  Big  Brother  intervention  as  hon  members  of  the
opposition would have  us  believe.  [Interjections.]  It  is  a  reasonable
measure to protect parents' fees, and  to  bring  education  legislation  in
line with the principles of the Promotion of Access to Information  Act  and
the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act.

It does not help to say  that  there  are  only  a  few  schools  that  have
transgressed regulations. The point is that there is an onus  on  the  state
to regulate all schools, whether they  are  good  or  bad.  [Interjections.]
School governing bodies will be able to raise loans  or  enter  into  credit
agreements provided they have written permission from the  MEC.  It  is  our
view that the  state  has  a  responsibility  to  ensure  that  when  school
governing bodies raise loans, they will be in  a  position  to  repay  these
without jeopardising state assets that might inadvertently have been put  up
as surety on these loans.

I  also  think  it  is  important  to  say  a  few   words   regarding   the
representative councils of learners. The primary purpose of these bodies  is
to instil a sense of responsibility and leadership skills in learners.  This
cannot  happen  if  they  continue  to  be  sidelined  within   the   school
administrative system. To play a meaningful role, they  need  responsibility
for issues such as extramural clubs and societies, and,  to  the  extent  to
which students are involved in  discipline,  this  function  needs  to  fall
under the representative council of learners.

One of the primary civic lessons  which  we  are  trying  to  build  in  our
society is that leadership and authority derive from a mandate and  must  be
exercised  under  conditions  of  responsibility  and  accountability.  This
lesson becomes a very hollow one to young people if it exists side  by  side
with a prefect system that is arbitrary, authoritarian and unaccountable  to
the very people over whom it is exercising power.

Turning to the General and Further Education and Training Quality  Assurance
Bill, one of the difficulties that we have seen  in  the  further  education
and training sector has been the lack  of  a  common  minimum  standard  for
quality assurance and service delivery. This problem  has  been  exacerbated
by the plethora of accrediting institutions in the  education  system  as  a
whole. The Gauteng province believes there is a need to strive  for  greater
uniformity in the education system  and  believes  that  the  Bill  makes  a
positive contribution in this regard.

In the course of public hearings held in our province we were made aware  of
some of the difficulties independent schools in  historically  disadvantaged
areas might have in applying for  accreditation.  We  were  assured  by  the
Department of Education that schools receiving  a  state  subsidy  would  be
included in the departmental accreditation processes. We believe  that  this
provision will cover the majority of  independent  schools  in  historically
disadvantaged areas.

We were also made aware of the concerns of some stakeholders  regarding  the
extent to which the Bill makes provision for public-private partnerships  in
the field of accreditation. We were assured  that  clause  28  of  the  Bill
allows the General and Further  Education  and  Training  Quality  Assurance
Council to enter into public-private partnerships to perform any or some  of
its functions. I think that the hon the Minister stated this again today.

We, in Gauteng, believe that this Bill and the  General  Law  Amendment  Act
will assist  us  in  standardising  and  normalising  public  schooling  and
further education and training in our province. We welcome both of  them  as
a contribution to ensuring a basic minimum standard  of  public  service  in
public schools and further education and training institutions. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs present  and  the
honourable House, I have been mandated by my province, the  North  West,  in
the absence of a special  delegate,  to  represent  it  and  to  convey  its
support of the Bills in terms of the mandates received.

The proposed Education Laws Amendment Bill now before this honourable  House
seeks to amend the South African Schools Act of 1996, the Further  Education
and Training Act of 1998 and the Employment of Educators Act  of  1998.  The
amendments were the result of an evaluation process of  the  above-mentioned
Acts in order to close loopholes that existed in them.

Clause  1  of  the  Education  Laws  Amendment  Bill   provides   that   the
representative council of learners is the  only  recognised  and  legitimate
learner body at the school. The significance of this provision  is  that  it
helps to avoid  situations  in  which  rival  councils  are  established  by
opposing student groups in the same school.

Clause 6 of this Bill limits a school to a single banking  account,  but  it
does not prohibit a public school from  investing  surplus  funds  with  the
approval of the MEC. However, it does prohibit governing bodies from  paying
moneys from the school fund into a trust  account  or  from  establishing  a
trust. The reason for this prohibition on trusts is  that  school  governing
bodies or principals  could  easily  hide  school  moneys,  thus  misleading
parents and frustrating the principle of promoting transparency.

In fact, school funds are intended to benefit the learner during his or  her
learning career. It is therefore logical that the school must  not  set  out
to amass large amounts of money, which will  not  be  used  to  benefit  the
learners and which  will  ultimately  tempt  the  principal  to  purchase  a
Mercedes-Benz, as in the case  of  the  principal  of  Ermelo  Hoërskool  in
Mpumalanga, something the Minister has already alluded to.

In respect of the Employment of Educators Act of 1998,  schedule  2  of  the
Act is amended to  make  provision  for  educators  to  appeal  against  the
findings arising from a disciplinary hearing, and that  in  cases  in  which
the accused educator wishes to bring a legal representative,  the  presiding
officer should decide whether or not to allow it.

The General and  Further  Education  and  Training  Quality  Assurance  Bill
before the honourable House aims to  establish  a  quality  assurance  body,
which would ensure quality in the delivery  and  outcomes  of  the  national
education training  system.  The  appointment  of  the  chairperson  of  the
council by the Minister has our support. This office is too important to  be
left in the hands of council members to sort out amongst themselves.

The functions of the council, with which we  are  in  full  agreement,  are,
inter alia, to  monitor  the  suitability  and  adequacy  of  standards  and
qualifications; to assure the quality of learner assessment at exit  points;
and to issue certificates of learner achievement and so on.

Clauses 18 and 19 of the Bill  make  provision  for  the  functions  of  the
provider  or  the  assessment  body  regarding  external  examinations.  The
functions include taking appropriate measures to  combat  irregularities  at
examinations and marking centres  so  that  irregularities,  such  as  those
which occurred at the marking centre in one of our  provinces  recently,  do
not recur. However, should they happen, the council  is  obliged  to  report
any such malpractices to the director for his or her attention.

The council is also empowered to cancel a certificate in  serious  cases  in
which a learner has not fulfilled the requirements  for  the  qualification.
The  issue  of  irregularities  and  noncompliance   with   the   prescribed
examination policy is so serious in terms of this Bill that a person can  be
found guilty of an offence and be liable to imprisonment.

Motlotlegi Modulasetilo, ka mafoko a, ke bua fano gore Porofense  ya  Bokone
Bophirima e tlatsa Molaotlhomo o gore o  amogelwe.  [Legofi.]  [Chairperson,
with these words, I would like to say that the North West  urges  that  this
Bill be supported. [Applause.]]

the beginning.]

Umntwana B Z ZULU: Sihlalo, ngingaqala ekuqaleni?

Bengicelwe uSihlalo wami ekomidini wathi uyothokoza kakhulu  uma  ngikhuluma

[Prince: B Z ZULU: Chairperson, may I start at the beginning?

My committee chairperson said he would be glad if I delivered my  speech  in
my mother tongue. Therefore my whole speech is prepared in my language.

The Department of Education has made major  progress  in  dealing  with  the
challenges that it faces, such as improving the level of  education,  skills
and equality in the education system.  The  success  of  the  department  in
attaining its goals is clear. This was caused by  the  introduction  of  new
system last year. This system is not just there to produce  highly  educated
people, but also to ensure  that  they  have  high-quality  knowledge  in  a
developing world.

Most institutions teaching skills, that  we  inherited  from  the  apartheid
government, had an expiring work programme. These  institutions  were  built
on the foundation of apartheid. The system that I am talking about  here  is
the one that haunted the people of South Africa for a long time.

The structure  of  the  system  that  operated  in  those  institutions  was
designed in a way  that  discouraged  the  development  of  the  mind  of  a
student. A student did not get the courage to improve and  prepare  for  his
future so that he could be serious  in  this  world  in  which  progress  in
technology takes place quickly.

The Department of Education has managed to solve most of the  problems  that
were created by apartheid. One of  the  problems  that  the  department  has
resolved was the redeployment of 30 000  teachers  in  new  positions  where
they were needed most. This job was done successfully  since  not  a  single
teacher was retrenched.

This Department of Education has worked  successfully  in  improving  matric
results last year by 90% as compared to the previous  year's  results.  This
improvement was noticed in all nine provinces of South Africa.

The department has used thousands of millions of rands  to  buy  study  aids
for students at schools. It has also managed to make  progress  in  ensuring
that the school development programme functioned equally under the  National
Norms and Standards for School Funding. This means that those  schools  that
are in dire need of money will get 7%  more  than  those  that  have  enough
money.

South Africa  has  a  large  number  of  students  in  schools  compared  to
developed countries. Another thing that was noticed was the increase in  the
number of female students in South African schools, something that  has  put
our country at a high international level. The department is campaigning  to
restructure college and teaching education. This means a  great  achievement
in the department.

The Quantitative Overview of  South  African  Technical  Colleges  that  was
printed in October last year identified  the  challenge  to  transform  this
college and teaching education. This has led to the formation of a  National
Landscape Task Team. The main job of this team is to advise  the  department
on what this field should look like in future.

Another important thing is the way that colleges and  training  institutions
can be restructured. The management of so many institutions that  are  doing
one and the same thing means a great loss for the Department  of  Education.
Colleges and training institutions are in the majority  and  they  cost  the
department millions of rands. I am talking about  152  independent  colleges
and teaching institutions. The Department  of  Education  aims  at  reducing
them to only 50. Those that will remain, according to the  department,  will
be  linked  with  universities  of  South  Africa.  The  joining  of   these
institutions will be done so that some students will be  assisted  with  the
money that is put in to these institutions.  The  department  aims  to  have
this programme in use by 2003.]

Quality assurance and quality improvement are fundamental to  ensuring  that
general  further  education  and  training  programmes  meet  the  needs  of
learners, communities, employers and society. Quality assurance  provides  a
means of benchmarking our programmes and qualifications against one  another
and the rest of the world.

Continual  quality  improvement  is  vital  if  we  are   to   address   the
inequalities and deficiencies of the past and ensure the responsiveness  and
relevance of provision in a dynamically changing  and  globally  competitive
world. Therefore, the priorities of the new council  will  be  to  establish
projects to investigate and pioneer work in  quality  assurance  of  further
education and training institutions; to provide certification of Abet  Level
4 learners; to provide accreditation of school education providers;  and  to
modernise assessment and moderation, and ensure that appropriate  experience
and expertise are available in this regard.

The council will be accredited by the  SA  Qualifications  Authority  as  an
education and training quality assurance body, and we are sure that it  will
execute its quality assurance function in this context. As for  the  funding
of the council, the Bill is clear as to what the  main  sources  of  funding
will be and this will include fees charged for rendering  services  such  as
certification  of  learners;  accreditation  of  providers;  and  Government
allocation and donor funding. The ANC supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr P S SIZANI (Eastern Cape):  Chairperson,  hon  Prof  Asmal,  Minister  of
Education, MECs and hon members, the education system  in  the  Republic  of
South Africa, as we have now come  to  know,  is  undergoing  major  changes
unheard of in this country. Some South Africans, who  are  comfortable  with
what they know or  who  have  become  accustomed  to  what  they  know,  are
reluctant to give us their unqualified support when we make the change,  for
fear of the unknown. Some of them have a  dogmatic  adherence  to  ideology,
untempered by empathy with the sensitivities  of  the  population  in  their
areas of jurisdiction.

Ours is  not  a  dogmatic  adherence,  for  we  can  deal  with  ideological
challenges. But we have an  obligation  to  build  a  democratic  nonsexist,
nonracial and united education system, based  on  the  rule  of  law  and  a
culture of human rights. It would be folly, therefore, to follow  the  Roman
emperors  who  sought  to  change  the  workings   of   the   Greek   empire
institutions, but left Greek teachers  in  the  empire's  schools.  The  two
Bills, namely, the  Education  Laws  Amendment  Bill  and  the  General  and
Further Education and Training Quality Assurance Bill, seek to address  this
very point.

By way of the Education Laws Amendment Bill  we  seek  to  amend  the  South
African Schools  Act  so  as  to  provide  for  representative  councils  of
learners  to  be  fully  recognised  learner  bodies  at  the  schools.  The
coexistence of the RCLs and the prefect system has been a violation  of  the
South African Schools Act. This, in our view, is a residue of  the  Model  C
schools that are very authoritarian and  therefore  out  of  line  with  the
democratic norms of the new  South  Africa.  The  amendment  will  therefore
assist in the process of transformation and build learners'  leadership  and
confidence in preparation for their future roles in society.

The Bill further  provides  the  provincial  department  of  education  with
instruments regarding the failure of the school governing bodies to  perform
their functions. When they do, they are prohibited from  raising  loans  and
overdrafts without authority or stashing  those  funds  in  trust  accounts.
Again, this is a relic of the past which remains with us and  must  be  done
away with, not the centralisation of power, as the hon Helen Zille tries  to
suggest.

I commend the Minister and  all  those  who  support  this  Bill  for  their
insight and foresight because these amendments go  into  the  grain  of  the
South  African  management  and  governance   that   complicate   provincial
administration unnecessarily.

The Genfetqa goes a bit further since it  provides  for  the  establishment,
composition and  functioning  of  the  General  and  Further  Education  and
Training Quality Assurance Council with  clear  quality  assurance  in  that
band. The certificates at exit points are controlled by norms and  standards
of curriculum and assessment as provided for by this Bill. In  that  regard,
the Safcert Act of 1986 is repealed; another relic of the past.
In the Eastern Cape we have demarcated, at GET schools, Grades 3,  6  and  9
exit points to assess learner achievements  and  performance  and  built  in
continuous assessment as an OBE principle,  and  an  integral  part  of  the
formative assessment  in  the  classroom.  We  are  currently  piloting  GET
certification in the form of external and  continuous  assessment  tasks  to
assess learner performance.

The amendments in the FET Act of 1998 will help complete the  framework  for
FET band transformation currently under way, to avoid the dichotomy  of  the
old curriculum and assessment bases  in  the  new  system.  In  our  earlier
submission we indicated that the Bill should take  on  board  Abet,  private
providers and other training providers. Further, the  Bill  must  align  the
assessment  processes  with  the  OBE  paradigm  so  that  outdated  Safcert
principles should not infringe OBE principles. I see that this  is  done  in
part. We in the Eastern Cape fully support the amendments and wish  to  urge
the NCOP to rally behind the Minister and  all  those  who  love  democracy.
[Applause.]

Ms T J NDIMANDE (Northern Province): Chairperson, hon members,  I  bring  to
the House greetings from the Northern Province, the home  of  peace.  May  I
also take this opportunity to express my  honest  and  sincere  appreciation
for having been afforded the opportunity to participate  in  this  important
debate,  which  will  undoubtedly  contribute  towards  the  reconstruction,
development and transformation of our education system.

The Education Laws Amendment Bill is aimed at  amending  the  South  African
Schools Act, Act 84 of 1996, the Employment of  Educators  Act,  Act  76  of
1998, and the Further Education and Training Act, Act 98 of 1998. One  would
have loved to make inputs on these three Acts above. However, owing to  time
limitations, I will only focus on the first two, ie  Sasa  and  EEA  because
our experience is drawn from our interactions with schools.

Currently, Sasa provides for the establishment of  RCLs,  ie  representative
councils of learners, at each and every public school that  enrols  learners
in the eighth grade and higher.

We in  the  Northern  Province  support  the  above-mentioned  amendment  of
section 11 of the principal Act because clause 1 provides for the RCL to  be
the only recognised and legitimate representative body for the  learners  at
a school. Our experience is that former Model C schools have a  tendency  of
establishing parallel learner representative structures in the form of  RCLs
and the prefect system.

More often than  not  RCLs  are  seen  as  representatives  of  historically
disadvantaged learners, whilst prefects are a preserve of  the  historically
advantaged learner population. This state of affairs cannot be tolerated  or
left to continue, because it is one way of perpetuating racism in  the  most
subtle manner. Therefore this Bill will  go  a  long  way  in  strengthening
democratic practices at institutional levels and  also  deals,  and  harshly
so, with any vestiges of racial practice.

Another contentious issue I would like to speak about is  clause  4  of  the
Bill, which attempts to amend section 25 of Sasa.  This  clause  deals  with
the powers of the head of department in terms of handling  school  governing
bodies which are dysfunctional. Clause 4 empowers the head of department  to
appoint sufficient persons to perform some or  all  of  the  functions  that
were exercised by the predecessor SGB  for  a  period  not  exceeding  three
months. These amendments get our full support.

The Bill further provides for the head of department to cause  the  election
of a new SGB within a year of the appointment of the  interim  or  temporary
SGB. We have a slight problem with this amendment, because what it  actually
means is that the HOD may cause the election of an SGB  within  12  calendar
months, even beyond the three-month period of the temporary SGB.

To  illustrate  my  point,  suppose  the  SGB  of  school  A  proves  beyond
reasonable doubt to be dysfunctional around December 2000, the head  of  the
department then appoints sufficient persons as an interim SGB  from  January
to March 2001, which is three months. This Bill says  that  the  HOD  should
cause the election of the new SGB within one year of  the  establishment  of
the interim structure.

The HOD can therefore cause an election in February or March 2001, in  which
case there will be no problem, or in April, May or June, etc, in which  case
there will be a lacuna or a vacuum in the governance of the  school  because
the  interim  structure's  term  of  office  will  have  expired.  We  would
therefore propose that the time frames for  the  election  of  the  new  SGB
should fall within the period of the temporarily appointed SGB to avoid  the
lacuna situation I have illustrated here.

Currently, section 36 of Sasa provides guidelines for the  handling  of  the
finances of the school. Our experience  is  that  some  schools,  especially
former Model C schools, exceed their powers with regard to the  finances  of
the school in their effort to raise funds as provided  for  in  section  36.
Our experience has further taught us that such actions by  SGBs  might  lead
to fraud and related financial irregularities. Consequently we  support  the
proposed amendment in that it prohibits SGBs from raising any loans  without
the express written approval of the MEC.

Section 37 of Sasa provides for the establishment of a school fund, and  all
moneys must be deposited into one banking account. There is  also  provision
for the establishment  of  a  trust.  Experience  in  our  interaction  with
various schools in the Northern Province has taught us that in some  schools
moneys are given to schools by way of a trust  and  such  trustees  are  not
controlled by the department.

Legally speaking, such  trustees  are  accountable  to  the  Master  of  the
Supreme Court. That makes it difficult for the  department  to  control  and
monitor such funds. Where a school operates  more  than  one  bank  account,
there is always room for financial misappropriation as  well.  The  proposed
amendment states that only one banking account should be maintained  by  the
school. No school funds should be used to establish a trust or be  deposited
in any trust account. We fully agree with this  amendment,  because  schools
which are run by sophisticated school governing bodies do often  abuse  such
a facility.

Furthermore, the amendment proposes that where  any  trust  was  established
out of school funds, or where money from the school fees was deposited  into
such a trust before January 2002, such payment is invalid,  and  that  money
should be put back into the school funds.

We are convinced that these amendments, once passed into  law,  will  indeed
go a long way in ensuring that our schools become centres of community  life
and academic excellence.

[I am still surprised to see members standing up here in order to  encourage
the use of overdrafts as well as loans in  our  schools,  because  they  are
also part of all that is taking place there. They are afraid of  losing  and
it causes delays in delivery to children who are poor. They are even  afraid
to go to those schools, and speak through legislative councils  as  well  as
judicial courts. They prevent this Government  from  doing  its  work.  That
will never happen again; there is no turning back.

The gravity of this Act is to reduce  and  do  away  with  maladministration
caused by school managers in our schools who  are  interested  in  enriching
themselves, so that children who were deprived of  education  in  the  past,
due to poverty, would be unable to continue with their studies. It  is  only
those who come from rich families, as was always the case in the  past,  who
manage to continue their school education. They will never see  that  happen
again, they are just heaping misfortune on themselves. The  objective  of  a
school, if you wish to know, is child-centred.  A  child  is  the  prominent
part of a school and should receive education free of charge, without  being
told of financial matters. In regard to bank accounts  and  loans,  are  you
school managers thinking of becoming money lenders? What is going to  happen
if you fail to pay back your overdraft? Surely the responsibility  to  repay
is not that of the Department of Education? It must be abolished.

We would like to thank hon Minister Kader  Asmal  and  his  department,  who
identified that something was wrong, that there were differences.  In  rural
areas there are schools where children sit in the dust, where there  are  no
cement floors. The stadiums of schools look like Orlando  stadium,  but  are
ordinary playing fields. Such things should be done away with,  because  all
children are equal. A child is a child,  whether  he  or  she  is  white  or
black; all South  African  children  are  equal.  They  must  do  away  with
discrimination so that the previously disadvantaged children can  also  feel
they are accepted like any other person. [Applause.]]

Ka gore bjale re a go leboga. [We say thank you.]

Mr H T SOGONI: hon Chairperson, hon Minister  of  Education,  MECs,  special
delegates present here and members, the UDM supports the  Bills  put  before
the NCOP, namely the Education Laws  Amendment  Bill  and  the  General  and
Further Education and Training Quality Assurance Bill.

It is the UDM's view  that  the  Education  Laws  Amendment  Bill  seeks  to
provide specific context or meaning and/or clarity to some sections  of  the
relevant principal Acts where otherwise the  intention  of  the  legislation
was not clearly defined or sufficiently underlined.

Section 11 of the South African Schools Act  allowed  the  establishment  of
representative councils of  learners,  but  the  amendment  before  us  goes
further to declare such a learners' council to be the  only  recognised  and
legitimate body. These provisions, in our view,  should  serve  to  regulate
with certainty and also to define, once and for all,  the  roles  and  power
relations between the learners' council and other  learners'  structures  in
public schools.

Considering the critical role and responsibilities of the governing  bodies,
there is justification for the intervention by the head  of  the  department
to ensure that the governing bodies  continue  to  perform  their  functions
unhindered in terms of  the  law.  But  it  is  equally  important  for  the
Department of Education to provide a clear mechanism as well as to  identify
situations that create a vacuum in the performance of functions by SGBs  and
act promptly in response.

There are reported cases where some schools run either without  a  governing
body or without a full complement thereof for unreasonable lengths of time.

Section 36 of the principal Act  permits  a  governing  body  to  "take  all
reasonable measures within its means to supplement  the  resources  supplied
by the state in  order  to  improve  the  quality  of  education.''  It  is,
however, not clear to me whether the use of ``may not''  in  subsection  (2)
does not create uncertainty regarding the intention  of  the  legislator  in
this regard, if the intention is to make it compulsory to seek  the  written
approval of the MEC before such  loan  or  overdraft  agreement  is  entered
into, when the appropriate undertaking could be made by the department  that
such written approval  by  the  MEC  would  be  obtainable  with  the  least
possible delay.

Regarding the amendment of section 37(3), the UDM is in full agreement  with
regard to the  keeping  of  one  banking  account  by  the  governing  body,
obviously for purposes of proper control.

I am also satisfied, after thorough briefing by  the  department,  that  the
amendment of subsection (6) as a precautionary measure  serves  to  prohibit
the payment of school funds into a trust, or that such school  funds  should
not be used to establish a trust. This provision  will  keep  all  financial
resources collected from parents in the hands of the SGB.

Finally,  on  the  General  and  Further  Education  and  Training   Quality
Assurance Bill, the establishment of the council  is  also  welcome.  Clause
6(1)(b) of the Bill was adequately addressed during the  briefings.  Whether
or not the chairperson of the council will  be  appointed  by  the  Minister
from among the council members as the Bill proposes, the appointment to  the
position, in the view of the UDM, should be purely on merit to  ensure  that
competence, efficiency and quality are not compromised. [Applause.]

of Education, Professor A K Asmal, colleagues from  all  provinces  and  hon
members in this House.]

Allow me to start by conveying  a  message  to  the  opposition,  a  message
especially to those who are not in favour of this amending Bill. I  want  to
say to them that this House is one that  represents  the  interests  of  the
provinces,  and  not  a  ground  for  competition.  We  are  here  to  share
experiences from our different provinces so that, at the  end  of  the  day,
the Minister will be able to identify those gaps and flaws which need to  be
amended.

[Allow me also to address Section 11 of the South  African  Schools  Act  of
1996. The Act is amended in  order  to  form  one  council  of  learners  in
schools, known as the RCL, or representative council of learners.  The  main
aim of this Bill is to enable it to embrace this  council  in  our  schools.
Previously this council was ignored and neglected.

Most councils of learners were discriminated against during the time of  the
prefect system and at schools where there are  prefects  at  present.  These
councils  did  not  enjoy  their  rightful  privileges.  The  representative
council of learners will have legal leadership, representing  all  learners.
Amending this Bill is an example of exercising the rights  of  equality  and
inclusivity. This is what is taking place in the  ANC  Government.  Equality
and inclusivity are matters which this Government cannot do away  with.  The
process and management of this council will be promulgated by notice in  the
Gazette for each province. This council will help learners to abide  by  the
rules.

The second point in this Bill is to prevent  school  governing  bodies  from
opening trust funds, or any account with school funds from children, or  any
other money of the school that may be put into a trust fund or  an  account.
There are a lot of problems in this regard, but other political  parties  do
not align themselves with this view because they benefited a  lot  and  they
still want to continue to enrich themselves through the same  process.  They
want to continue to exploit parents by using their money in an  unacceptable
manner. Section 37(4) is amended to allow schools to open  a  trust  account
in the following manner. It must be done through  a  letter  of  application
directed to the MEC of the  Department  of  Education  in  order  to  ensure
transparency. All financial matters must be presented very clearly.  Parents
and schoolchildren should know the position of their school fund.

Should there be any surplus money from the school fund or if a  donation  is
made, permission will be granted  to  open  a  trust  account  and  approval
should be obtained from the MEC  of  the  department  of  education.  School
funds that were used for the opening of a trust account before 2002 must  be
paid back. I heard someone asking what was going to  happen  to  money  used
for building a structure. In that case receipts  must  be  produced  to  the
department as proof of the erection of a school building.

A lot of stakeholders in the Department of  Education  wanted  to  know  why
schools were no longer allowed to open  trust  accounts  on  their  own.  In
regard to school funds for certain schools, especially the Model C  schools,
managers used to bank school funds and stash it away so that by the time  it
reached maturity it would have been paid into the accounts of  the  managers
of that trust, possibly for Van Tonder or Piet Hoender, for example.

If a school happens to construct  certain  facilities,  for  example,  where
school funds are used for the erection of a  computer  centre  and  children
are made to pay a certain amount in order to be able  to  learn  at  such  a
centre, this  could  be  eliminated  if  things  are  well  organised.  Then
children can use that school facility without  making  any  further  payment
for those purposes.

Another point is that in so far as operating a trust fund is concerned,  the
Government is not  allowed  to  interfere  and  may  not  have  a  say.  The
Government is excluded from the  process,  therefore  Government  should  in
fact be allowed to have a say too. Another impediment in  respect  of  trust
accounts is that the beneficiaries keep  on  changing.  Today  it  might  be
Nkuna,  Ndimande  and  Witbooi.  Tomorrow  the  beneficiaries  may  be  Piet
Hoender, Van der Merwe, Van Niekerk and Van Tonder. Another  painful  matter
in this regard, hon members, is  that  such  moneys  are  used  to  pay  the
salaries of teachers appointed by the South African Government.]

In the previous dispensation we  had  Ministers  that  had  the  sole  power
themselves. A Minister would take a decision, not even communicating  it  to
his wife. He would just do it on his own. In the democratic dispensation  or
in a democratic situation, in no way can  hon  Minister  Asmal,  or  whoever
takes a decision, do so on his own. Our Ministers and our MECs subscribe  to
the principle of consultation.

When we talk about the MEC or the Minister, we are referring  to  an  office
where there are advisers and there is a support group. We no longer want  to
see a situation in which an account opened with school funds bears  a  rugby
team's name. Secondly, the ANC Government is not interested in  a  situation
in which moneys in a trust are frozen or stashed away in order to cater  for
someone during his or her retirement.

I have already said that the disadvantage of a trust is  that  beneficiaries
can change from this colour to  that  colour.  Transparency  should  be  the
question of the day. Definitely parents  need  to  know  the  state  of  the
finances relating to the school, whether it is a trust or in a school  fund.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, may I  make  a  confession  to  this
House. Although by profession I am described as a lawyer,  I  have  been  an
educationalist all my life from the time I was a school teacher to the  time
that I was a university dean. All my interests have really  been  education.
Therefore when I say this, I say it with pride. What we have done  in  seven
years is unparalleled. If we look at all the postwar  societies  which  were
destroyed in the war and the transition in postcolonial countries,  such  as
our neighbours, their education systems are in effect the same as under  the
colonial system.

Still today it is the case. If we look  at  Europe,  the  reconstruction  of
particularly education took nearly 25 years. The pride is that  general  and
further education quality assurance is the last stage of the  great  reforms
of the ANC Government. I mean this seriously.  Only  this  Government  could
have done it.

The first Bill we passed was the SA Qualifications Authority Bill,  not  the
South African Schools Bill or the  discipline  of  teachers  Public  Service
Bill. It was also not a higher  education  Bill,  but  a  quality  assurance
Bill. We want equity and fairness as a Government, but  we  want,  in  fact,
quality with it. We did not fight apartheid to get bantu education  under  a
new name. Essential to us is the fact that there must be quality. The  great
pride I take is in bringing to this House - I have not  spoken  on  this  in
the National Assembly - the information that no other country has been  able
to achieve this in seven or eight years: to  bring  to  a  close  the  whole
issue of quality assurance throughout the educational system. We now have  a
quality assurance body for higher education also. It is nonsense  that  some
degrees are better than others. There will not be tittle-tattle  and  gossip
but it will actually be affirmed by this quality body. We have done that  to
higher education, because we in this Government want the best for people.

That is why I say, with some pain, that I respond to  hon  Witbooi  and  hon
Zille. I get on very well socially with  Ms  Zille.  It  is  a  pleasure  to
interact with her socially. There is  a  kind  of  split  personality.  What
happens at the Council of Education Ministers and what happens  three  weeks
later in the public press shows  this  split  personality.  It  is  a  split
personality that perplexes me, because the  Education  Laws  Amendment  Bill
was unanimously adopted by the  Council  of  Education  Ministers.  What  Ms
Zille talks about, the tendency towards  centralisation,  is  a  myth.  What
this means is that eight MECs agree, while she may have  some  reservations.
That reservation is then blown up, then, as an attempt to centralise.

Our MECs say that they want a national law  to  cover  the  appointment  and
election of the  school  learning  councils.  The  Western  Cape  is  not  a
``Zilleville''. She does not have a  prerogative  to  decide  entirely  what
happens in the Western Cape. It is a national matter. I have  news  for  the
hon  member:  The  Constitutional  Court  upheld  the  norms  and  standards
established by the national educational policy for public schools.

In the same way, I would like to ask the hon Mrs Witbooi  and  Ms  Zille  to
look at the actual Act in relation to the trust funds. Nobody has argued  in
support of the trust fund. What the two  hon  members  have  said  was  that
difficulties arise. Let me look at those  difficulties  for  a  moment.  One
reason  I  am  introducing  this  is  that  school  fees  are  skyrocketing,
particularly in the former Model C schools. As the former  Model  C  schools
are opening up on racial grounds, I do not see the Western Cape saying  that
they should look at, for example, the catchment area for the schools at  the
foothills of Table Mountain.  Public  schools  at  the  foothills  of  Table
Mountain have their own catchment areas, which means that learners  who  are
maids' children cannot get in. As the national department, we are  going  to
look at these catchment areas, because the deracialisation  of  our  schools
is still a central matter. I will come to the  question  of  deracialisation
and equality in a moment.

Fees are going up. Some of the schools that raise fees  are  state  schools.
Parents are paying about R9 000, R10 000 or R12 000. This is impossible.  My
job as the national Minister is to ensure that the poor do not have  to  pay
fees. But some of these schools ask for deposits, which may be  as  high  as
R3 000. It is illegal to do that. I would like to say to Ms  Zille  that  we
would rather publicly say  this  on  egalitarian  grounds,  not  controlling
privilege. It is illegal to ask for a deposit, on egalitarian grounds.

Time and again Gauteng has produced a leaflet which they  have  put  in  the
newspapers. Gauteng and the Western Cape are not oases in South Africa.  Hon
Ms Zille must understand that. But really, quality does  not  come  with  20
more additional teachers, or through the fees. Quality does  not  come  with
schools which look like the south of England, with  vines  creeping  on  the
chapel. Quality does not come with that. Quality  comes  with  the  teaching
process inside the school. That  is  why  the  Western  Cape  has  the  most
unequal school system in South Africa. The hon member should remember that.

This Government has reduced inequality between provinces by  60%.  It  is  a
great triumph and, consequently, impressions have been given that the  norms
and standards of funding were highly controversial when they  started.  This
Government  decided  to  move  resources  fairly   and   modestly   to   the
disadvantaged places. But  the  inequalities  within  a  province  are  very
great. We must take it systematically.

I know that the DA does not support ``regstellende  aksie'',  or  corrective
action, for their own constituencies' sake. But, in the  area  of  education
it is impossible to countenance the vast inequalities today.  Whether  there
may be justification for that, we can no longer countenance  these  enormous
inequalities. It is only the ANC Government that says, and I seriously  mean
it, that we must deal with inequality in a very quiet  but  systematic  way.
We do not want warlords involved in this. We do  not  want  abrupt  changes,
but we can no longer countenance these  vast  and  painful  inequalities.  I
mean this because I go around schools in the whole of South  Africa.  It  is
painful and humiliating, and we should not use elusive  words,  for  example
``One school has better standards,'' when a girl from a  big  squatter  camp
in Johannesburg gets matric exemption without a laboratory  or  library  and
with two unemployed illiterate parents, without water and electricity  in  a
shack, and is now at a university at the age of 15. How much real  potential
is down there which is never identified or acknowledged? That is why  it  is
very important that fees should  not  go  out  of  control,  but  should  be
controlled by parents and the school governing body.

Contrary to what hon Ms Zille said, there is  no  question  of  money  being
invested in building. I would like to ask her to look at her prerogative  to
vote against the Bill. It is a pity that she is doing  that,  because  there
is schizophrenia in the New NP and DP. They always  have  this  instinct  to
oppose educational measures. In the  National  Assembly  they  vote  against
every educational measure. There is some kind of schizophrenia. It may be  a
privilege, they are saying. Privilege must be retained and  maintained  and,
therefore, we will find squalid and irrelevant arguments.

If one looks at clause 6, for example, it  provides  that  trusts  must  pay
back such money or contributions to  the  school  fund.  If  the  money  has
already been used for a school building, that is nogal [quite] OK.  That  is
what has happened. If the money has to be transferred and the promises  were
made under the trust fund, that money can still be  used  for  the  purposes
for which the trust fund would have been used, except that now it  is  under
the control of  the  parents,  not  some  self-appointed  trustees  who  can
change. As vividly said by my  sister  Ndimande,  beneficiaries  can  change
from day to day. However exaggerated that may seem, it does happen. I  think
that there is a hidden South Africa.

Private power can be used very  officiously.  I  know  this  because  people
write to me when they cannot get their kids into schools, and  nobody  tells
them that they can appeal to the MEC. They write to me and some stop  me  in
the streets and tell me that they are told to pay  the  fees  but  they  are
unemployed. I would then write to the school's  headmaster  or  headmistress
to tell them that it is illegal to do that. I have to do this.  I  have  one
person from the private sector  who  deals  with  these  letters  full-time,
because so many people write to me, and I cannot refer them to  the  MEC.  I
take up such issues directly with the school. The issue of the state  taking
more power is nonsense.  It  is  not  true.  In  many  cases,  the  province
concerned, particularly on issues of race and  equality,  does  not  do  its
wretched work. It would even work  better,  rather  than  officiously  going
around, scattering invectives against nonperforming schools  that  might  do
better in this business.

Can I, therefore, say that under section 6  the  school  is  quite  free  to
continue what it is doing, although the money should now be transferred.  It
is  not  true,  therefore,  that  the  school  will  be  penalised.  As  for
creativity, we must stop creative accounting. The hidden South Africa  is  a
South Africa that we do not know, with some of us beginning to know what  is
happening. It is only the  hoërskool  [high  school]  there  and  the  silly
statements, which I treat with contempt, made by the hon  Raju.  It  is  not
becoming of this House to speak in that silly way. [Laughter.] It is a  form
of contempt for the rest of the people, because I can tell him that  in  his
province there are letters that I have received from Port Shepstone about  a
former Model C school spending money on the principal's  house  and  on  his
holidays. It is happening all over  the  place.  There  is  a  hidden  South
Africa that we should acknowledge.

Power without regulation and control can be  very  corrupting  against  poor
people. As for Ms Ndimande, I love the word ``lacuna''. There is no  lacuna.
Section 25 of the South African Schools Act does not  create  uncertainties.
But time frames must be seen in the context of the principal Act. We do  not
have time to go into it. I will give the hon members my reply. There  is  no
lacuna. In fact, it will flow evenly, if one looks at the principal Act.

In the same way, I agree very much with hon Tolo.  School  governing  bodies
are central to the Government's view about local  decision-making.  We  will
have to train, but unfortunately we cannot find enough money  but,  we  have
discussed it at the CEM. Some provinces are using their best  endeavours  to
train  before  the  elections.  I  agree  that  there   must   be   positive
discrimination for the rural learners. We must particularly build  them  up.
In my own view, the  school  feeding  scheme  must  ultimately  be  operated
through the school governing bodies. That is the only way it  can  work.  We
are going to give them particularly to the old mamas who know  what  poverty
is and have an instinctive sense of organisation, because they have  to  get
the R300 of the old age pension and feed nine people. They know what  to  do
with money and they will be the least corrupt ones  too,  on  the  principle
that men are much more corrupt than women, a principle which I subscribe  to
wholeheartedly.

As far as Mrs Witbooi is concerned, I think I have  answered  her  question,
because  I  think  the  DP  and  New  NP  are  simply  coalescing  in  their
misunderstanding of this.

May I compliment Ms Creecy and  Stone  Sizani  because  they  have  answered
fundamentally the issues that were raised today. I think it is very good  to
have taken part with them.

It has been a very stimulating debate, because,  frankly,  this  is  a  good
debating Chamber. I do not think I shall be stimulated much in the  National
Assembly when these Bills come up, but I would really  ask  members  not  to
adopt partisan positions. I have spoken to chairpersons at school  governing
bodies in former Model C schools. I have explained to them the purposes  and
said that they could have their trusts for other purposes,  as  I  explained
at the beginning of my speech. And they have accepted it.

I do not think we should mobilise in support of fears  the  people  may  not
have. I think it is not part of our way of creating that kind  of  consensus
about education that we want very badly in  South  Africa.  Therefore  I  am
pleased that the majority of the provinces, and I hope  all  the  provinces,
will in the end support these two very important measures. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Education Laws Amendment Bill agreed to in accordance  with  section  65  of
the Constitution (Western Cape dissenting).

General and Further Education and Training Quality Assurance Bill agreed  to
in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The  MINISTER  OF  EDUCATION:  Madam  Chairperson,  thank   you   for   this
opportunity to introduce this section 75 Bill to  the  National  Council  of
Provinces. I think, in the light of our discussion  earlier,  I  would  just
like to very briefly introduce this Bill and then ask for participation  and
I will answer the questions. I think that makes much more sense, frankly.

This Bill is necessitated simply by the introduction by  the  Government  of
the National Plan for  Higher  Education.  This  National  Plan  for  Higher
Education has a history  of  nearly  10  years,  frankly.  Long  before  the
elections, the ANC produced this yellow book on the principles of  education
for the future. It has a small section on universities, a small  section  on
the RDP programme on higher education  in  the  context  of  human  resource
development.

Then, of course, there was this massive White  Paper  on  higher  education,
possibly the most consulted White Paper ever in South African history. As  a
result of that, there was the Higher Education  Act.  The  Higher  Education
Act, again, attempted to set up a  seamless  indivisible  system  of  higher
education, while allowing for local and regional needs to be met, and, if  I
may say so, peculiarities also.

Let us get rid of this myth that the ANC wants to  homogenise  the  country.
We take great pride in our Constitution, but our language, our culture,  our
religious distinctiveness is no longer a matter for division, but  a  matter
for  great  pride.  There  are  those  who  do  not  have  any  culture   or
international culture, those who have no religion, who unite with those  who
have religion and culture to say South Africa is a wonderful  place  because
of diversity.

Therefore, in the same  way,  we  do  not  want  to  homogenise  the  higher
education system. What we do want is a higher education  system  that  meets
the needs of South Africa in the 21st century, a higher education system  in
which, in fact, access is open, a higher education system  that  also  takes
into account the needs of the locality, the region, and national needs.

So the national plan has much widespread support  both  within  and  without
the higher education system. The few voices coming  out  in  opposition  are
largely driven, and I must say, by very  narrow  personal  or  institutional
interests. By and large, the national plan has had enormous support.

Can I say, therefore, that change  will  not  take  place  in  South  Africa
without pain. There will have to be some pain, and out of pain, as we  know,
comes enormous opportunity for growth and development. So  we  look  at  new
institutions, new academic programmes and new research areas. This  is  what
higher education thrives  on.  We  want  more  research,  more  emphasis  on
African languages for example, which are totally discounted  in  our  higher
education.

We want three or four  areas  of  excellence  in  information,  science  and
technology. Three or four. We cannot afford 36. So we  will  have  three  or
four, as the Government has  decided,  areas  of  excellence.  But  we  want
enormous regional variations. Some  institutions  are  very  good  at  rural
agricultural and science. Some institutions are very good on governance.  We
want to put more money into developing that in South  Africa.  Some  schools
and universities are very good in modern languages,  but  they  are  running
them down.

We want to use this  as  an  opportunity  to  look  at  programmes,  at  new
research areas and, of course, very importantly, to  make  sure  that  every
child in school will now get the  information  about  the  36  institutions,
which, at present they do not get. We will set  up  a  central  applications
office or admissions office. Each university, technikon  will  still  decide
that. In that central applications office there will be all the  information
about the national financial aid scheme. The  hon  Chairperson  knows  this,
because she was chairperson of this body for five  or  six  years,  that  in
fact we have trained a quarter of a million young  people  who  would  never
have gone to university, but for the R2,5 billion to R3 billion we have  put
into our education and the training programme. A quarter of a million!  That
is really remarkable. Their pass rate, by  the  way  -  those  who  got  the
financial aid - is 75%. For those who are not financially  assisted  by  the
state - most of our children - the pass rate is  only  15%.  There  is  some
extraordinary thing that those who get assistance of the Government tend  to
do much better in the examinations.

This is the background to the amendments, which are, really, not  very  far-
reaching amendments. It is like asking: How will we have  the  path  to  the
reorganisation of higher education in  South  Africa  worked  out?  It  also
looks at this extraordinary relic of apartheid history, the private Acts  of
universities. All the universities have private Acts  which  are  introduced
in Parliament. Other  universities  have  to  do  with  the  general  Higher
Education Act regulating them.
I think the debate will be much  more  exciting  if  I  listen  to  the  hon
members and then respond to them. [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister, once more,  and  hon  members,  in
his call to action on 27 June 2000, the hon Minister Asmal said:


  We must implement a  rational,  seamless  higher  education  system  that
  grasps the intellectual and professional challenges facing South Africans
  in the 21st century.

Higher education plays a critical role in today's modern society, even  more
so in our young democracy. In our context, higher education is charged  with
the  responsibility  of  helping  to  stimulate,  direct  and  mobilise  the
creative and intellectual energies of all  South  Africans  towards  meeting
the challenges of the Reconstruction and Development Programme.

The higher education institutions that were inherited  by  democratic  South
Africa have their roots in the apartheid  social  order.  Some  institutions
unreservedly served the apartheid government's goals  and  policies.  Others
protested  against  racism  and  the   creation   of   racial   and   ethnic
institutions.  Yet  others  challenged  and  actively  resisted  the  social
purposes that were defined for them by apartheid planners and  attempted  to
elaborate new purposes linked to democracy and social justice.

However, in pursuit of these challenges, it is  critical  that  our  present
inherited system  of  higher  education  be  transformed  from  the  current
fragmented, unequal and inefficient  system  into  a  single,  national  co-
ordinated structure. The Higher Education Amendment Bill is  geared  towards
eliminating some of the obstacles in the path  of  achieving  the  aforesaid
system. These obstacles were not foreseen upon the enactment of  the  Higher
Education Act and  became  apparent  when  we  attempted  to  implement  the
provisions of the said Act.

It is against this background that we welcome the amendments to  the  Higher
Education Act, because they will strengthen the hand of  our  Government  in
developing the  national  plan,  that  is  providing  a  framework  for  the
restructuring and transformation of the higher education landscape.

At present the Act does not provide a  governance  framework  in  the  event
where a new university, college or technikon is established or where two  or
more existing institutions are merged. The Bill  addresses  this  vacuum  by
providing for the establishment of interim  councils,  as  outlined  in  the
National Plan for Higher Education, to perform  the  functions  relating  to
the governance of the institution for a period  not  exceeding  six  months.
The interim councils envisaged  in  the  Bill  would  ensure  that  the  new
organisations are based on the principles of nonracialism and democracy.

The Bill calls, among other things, for a merger between  the  two  distance
education universities, Vista and Unisa, and Technikon  RSA.  In  our  view,
this is a very  important  provision  since  the  Government  is  the  major
investor in higher education in  the  country  if  one  considers  that  the
public fiscus devotes more than R7 billion to the  support  and  development
of public higher education institutions, and this constitutes a  significant
part of the overall expenditure in education per annum.

It also provides for the legal dissolution of existing  councils  that  were
not discharging their legal and fiduciary responsibilities properly.

Obviously, the opposition would cry foul because, as  I  mentioned  earlier,
historically advantaged universities were their personal fiefdom.

Previously,  universities  could  also  exist  in  terms  of  private  Acts.
However, inasmuch as our new Higher Education Act laid the foundation for  a
single national higher education system, it left intact these private  Acts.
This omission created and  still  is  creating  problems  in  terms  of  the
composition and functions of university councils, senates and  institutional
fora.

The repeal of these private Acts should not  be  seen  as  an  intrusion  on
institutional autonomy and academic freedom, as argued  by  the  opposition,
but rather as an important step towards transforming the  affairs  of  these
institutions.

The country depends on the higher education system to meet  its  high  level
of human resource needs and to  be  the  engine  for  the  creation  of  new
knowledge, innovation and critical discourse.  We  expect  higher  education
managers to run their institutions in a responsible  and  inclusive  manner.
Similarly, we will expect councils to  account  for  their  responsibilities
and actions.

In conclusion, there is no government anywhere in the world  that  does  not
navigate higher education in  terms  of  broad  policies.  It  is  therefore
arrogant of the opposition to  disclaim  this  reality.  The  Bill  has  our
unqualified support. [Applause.]

Mev J WITBOOI: Agb Voorsitter, agb minister en agb lede,  ek  weet  nie  wat
ons dié keer genoem gaan word nie, ons was nou skisofrenies, maar  die  Nuwe
NP-komponent van die DA ondersteun nie dié wetgewing nie.

Die Nuwe NP kan hom nie vereenselwig met die feit dat die  beheer  van  hoër
opvoedkundige inrigtings van die Parlement weggeneem en  onder  ministeriële
beheer geplaas word nie.  Wanneer  gekyk  word  na  klousule  26,  maak  dié
klousule voorsiening vir die herroep van  private  wette.  Die  Nuwe  NP  se
siening hieroor is dat as daar elemente in bestaande private  wette  is  wat
strydig met die Grondwet van Suid-Afrika is, dié  wette  eerder  gewysig  as
herroep moet word.

Wanneer gekyk word na klousule 4 van die wysigingswetsontwerp, bemagtig  dit
die minister om interimrade in te stel.  Weer  eens  is  dit  'n  geval  van
minister en magte. Iewers langs die pad verloor ons die  demokrasie  en  ons
gee tog so hoog op daaroor. Ons vraag is of die  lede  van  die  interimrade
nie bevoeg genoeg is om hul eie voorsitter te kies nie.

Demokrasie, en ek herhaal, waaroor ons so hoog opgee, word  hier  'n  lelike
knou toegedien en die Nuwe NP kan hom nie hiermee vereenselwig nie.

Ek herhaal wat ek aan die begin gesê het, ongeag van wat  die  minister  ons
dié keer noem, ons was so  flussies  ``skisofrenies'',  stem  die  Nuwe  NP-
komponent  van  die  DA  nie  met  dié  wetsontwerp  saam  nie.   [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mrs J WITBOOI: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and  hon  members,  I  do  not
know what we are going to be called this time, because  we  were  previously
labelled schizophrenic, but the New NP component of the DA does not  support
this legislation.

The New NP cannot associate  itself  with  the  fact  that  the  control  of
institutions for higher learning  be  taken  away  from  Parliament  and  be
placed under ministerial control. When one looks  at  clause  26,  it  makes
provision for the repeal of private laws. The New NP is of the opinion  that
if there are elements in the existing private laws which  are  contradictory
to the Constitution of South Africa, those laws  should  rather  be  amended
than repealed.

When one looks at clause 4 of the amending Bill, it  empowers  the  Minister
to establish interim councils. Once again this is  a  question  of  Minister
and powers. Somewhere along the line we are losing our  democracy  of  which
we think so highly. Our question is  whether  the  members  of  the  interim
councils are not competent enough to elect their own chairperson.

Democracy, and I repeat, of which we think  so  highly,  is  being  dealt  a
terrible blow and the New NP cannot associate itself with that.

I repeat what I said at the beginning, irrespective of what the Minister  is
going to call us this time, a moment ago we were schizophrenic, the  New  NP
component of the DA does not agree with this Bill. Applause.]]

Mr N M RAJU: Hon Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  special  delegates,  hon
colleagues, the Higher Education Amendment Bill seeks to  amend  the  Higher
Education Act of 1997. Most universities  and  technikons  have  been  using
private Acts that were passed during  apartheid.  Some  of  these  Acts,  of
course, created universities on the basis of colour.

A number of obsolete Acts relating to higher education are still  in  force.
The aim of the Higher Education Amendment Bill is to repeal those  laws.  No
problem. The DP accepts the fact  that  the  transformation  of  the  higher
education system is absolutely necessary in the wider interests of  the  new
democratic dispensation in  South  Africa.  The  sinews  of  democracy  will
certainly be strengthened by the fresh ideas of transformation in the  field
of higher education.

The Higher Education Act of 1997 charged the Minister of Education with  the
responsibility of determining higher  education  policy  after  consultation
with the Council on Higher Education.

The Higher Education Amendment  Bill  will  be  the  only  legal  instrument
pertaining to universities,  once  the  private  Acts  of  universities  are
repealed. The repeal of the certification council  for  technikon  education
will result in the creation  of  the  higher  education  quality  committee,
which will be deemed to be accredited by the  South  African  Qualifications
Authority as an education and training quality assurance body.

The Higher Education Act does not provide a  governance  framework  where  a
new higher education institution is to be established or where  an  existing
institution is to be declared as a higher  institution  where  two  or  more
institutions are to be merged.

This Bill seeks to address this vacuum by making provision for the  Minister
of Education to establish an interim council  for  new  declared  or  merged
public institutions. The interim council will be given a  time-span  of  six
months. The council will consist of five members and  two  co-opted  members
without voting powers. The interim council has to perform the  functions  of
a single institution. However, the interim council is not empowered to  make
an institutional statute.

The DP voted against the  Bill  which  became  the  principal  Act  in  1997
because it considered that too  much  power  was  vested  in  the  Minister.
Unfortunately, the DP has had no reason to change its stance  and  therefore
opposes the Higher Education Amendment Bill. [Interjections.] This  is  also
because it is not convinced that too much power  should  be  vested  in  the
Minister.  Ministerial  oversight  of  universities  cannot  be  equated  to
parliamentary oversight.

Furthermore, the DP sees the Higher Education Amendment Bill as a threat  to
the  autonomy  and  academic  freedom  of  higher  education   institutions.
Creating space  for  the  possible  interference  by  the  Minister  in  the
governance  of  established  institutions  of  higher  education   forebodes
danger.

Let me hasten to assure the hon the Minister that  this  concern  about  the
excessive powers being given him, as envisaged in the  proposed  Bill,  does
not reflect one iota on the professional and moral integrity of his  person,
which we do not doubt is impervious to intellectual compromise. It is  on  a
matter of principle that my party observes that centralisation of  too  much
power in the office of the Minister cannot  be  good  for  higher  education
governance. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! If hon members wanted  a  longer  debate
they should have indicated so.

Ms S N NTLABATI: Chairperson, hon members, it  is  so  interesting  for  me,
having listened to the two members who did not support  the  amending  Bill,
how quickly they have forgotten that, just like  me,  they  were  in  Egypt.
They had no choice, if one was coloured, one had to go to the Western  Cape,
and if one was Indian, one had to go  to  Durban-Westville.  In  that  sense
they were victims of forced removals just  like  me.  They  have  forgotten.
[Interjections.]

May I also congratulate the Department of  Education  on  the  role  it  has
played in the transformation of institutions of  higher  learning  in  South
Africa since we acquired our democracy. We say to the hon the Minister  that
he should carry on. Regardless of our differences  in  ideology,  those  who
want to see do see and believe that we have  all  witnessed  the  tremendous
vision, collaboration and positive progress made since  1994.  However,  the
task has not been easy because we always had  these  people  who  wanted  to
oppose even where there was nothing to oppose.

We have come a long way as South Africans since the days when resources  and
the quality of education  were  allocated  according  to  colour,  race  and
gender. I doubt that the people of Asian origin and the so-called  coloureds
were any better off at all in that allocation. Those were the days when  the
Bantu Education Act of 1953 - if we are to trace this back  -  decreed  that
blacks should be provided with separate facilities under the control of  the
then Minister of Native Affairs, and not under the  Minister  of  Education.
Those were the days when the Extension of University Education Act  of  1959
prohibited blacks from attending white  institutions.  Indeed,  our  history
tells us those were bitter days  for  those  who  had  vested  interests  in
education because those  were  the  days  when  very  highly  qualified  and
committed academics decided to leave this country against their will.  Those
were the days, if I can  give  examples,  when  a  person  who  was  not  of
European origin who wanted to go to the University of  Cape  Town  would  be
asked the question: What is there in common between you and  the  people  of
European origin? That would be  the  answer  given  by  the  then  Minister,
called the Minister of Interior Affairs.

It was in this very House, then the Senate, that between 1954 and  1959  the
then brilliant Dr Verwoerd addressed the Senate to say  that  the  education
which was given by the missionariesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Take your seat, hon member. Yes, Mr  Van
Niekerk, are you rising on a point of order?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker,  I  just  want  to  enquire  whether  the
speakers are not supposed to speak on the Bill.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: You are asking  me  a  question.  What  is  the
point of order?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, the  point  of  order  is  that  the  hon
member is not speaking to the Bill.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member, you are being reminded of the  Rule
related to relevance, that you should speak to the legislation that  we  are
dealing with. You may proceed.

An HON MEMBER: With the Bill.

An HON MEMBER: Slaan hom, MaNtlabati. [Hit him, MaNtlabati.]

Ms S N NTLABATI: But for everybody to  understand,  one  has  to  understand
where one comes from and where one is in order to understand  exactly  where
one should be.

Those were the days of the discriminatory practices which limited access  of
black students and women students into fields such as  science,  engineering
and technology. I am talking about institutions of  higher  education  which
never constructed a critical civil society. Which is why I repeat  that  the
Minister should carry on with his amendments, and even with  the  repeal  of
whatever law is not beneficial to everybody in this country.

Therefore the higher education system that we inherited had to  be  amended.
There is just no choice. We want to carry  along  with  us  even  those  who
still do not agree with that. But I am sure that one day they  will  realise
that the ANC-led Government  was  right.  The  framework  seeks  to  promote
lifelong learning, that is the broader factor of this Bill as  well  as  our
education system, and to develop the workforce  in  this  country.  This  is
unlike in the past,  when  learning  did  not  encourage  inclusiveness  and
democratic citizenship.

The  key  challenges  facing  the  South  African  higher  education  system
remained as outlined in the White Paper. This Bill  is  not  deviating  from
that. It wants to redress past inequalities  and  to  transform  the  higher
education system to serve a new  social  order,  to  meet  present  national
links and to respond to new realities and opportunities.

These changes have to be understood in the context of the impact  on  higher
education  systems  worldwide,  and  of  the  changes  associated  with  the
phenomenon of globalisation. These have been spawned by  the  revolution  in
information and communications technology.
In the 21st century, knowledge and the processing  of  information  will  be
the key driving forces for wealth creation and, thus,  social  and  economic
development.

South Africa and the African continent have to lead that route, and I  think
that these very issues of amending or even repealing whatever  we  think  is
not going to carry us into the future  become  necessary.  It  even  becomes
necessary for us to achieve what  we  want  to  achieve  in  the  Millennium
African Recovery Programme.

As South Africa locates itself in  this  network  of  global  exchanges  and
interactions,  higher  education  will  have  to  produce  the  skills   and
technological innovations necessary for  successful  economic  participation
in the  global  market.  It  must  also  socialise  a  new  generation  with
requisite cultural values and communication competences to  become  citizens
of an international and global community.

Therefore, if knowledge is the electricity of the  new  globalisation,  then
higher education institutions must seize the opportunity of  becoming  major
generators of this source of power. I still say, as a parent, and on  behalf
of other parents, that it is imperative that the Minister  carries  on  with
his amendments.

To meet these demands and achieve these miracles, a  new  mobilisation  that
will release latent energies  and  talents  is  required.  Universities  and
other institutions of higher education constitute a major resource  for  the
generation of this new thinking. These, I believe, rest in the hands of  the
leadership, there at the institutions, which is what the Minister is  trying
to revolutionalise.

It is therefore for the above-mentioned reasons that the  amendment  of  the
Higher  Education  Act  becomes  not  just  necessary,  but  imperative  and
important. The White Paper states that all existing practices,  institutions
and values need to be viewed anew and rethought in terms  of  their  fitness
for this new era.

One major challenge we are facing as South Africa  is  the  fact  that  some
institutional cultures have not transcended the racial divide of the past.

Gender equity also continues to remain a problem, but the White Paper  seeks
to review it. As with black students, the spread of  women  students  across
different programme areas is uneven, and we hope  that  this  will  soon  be
rectified. As we all know, whatever we call  challenges,  let  us  not  take
them as obstacles. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Chairperson, may I complement  the  hon  Ms
Ntlabati, particularly on her concluding remarks, when she spoke  about  the
purpose of a university in higher education in the 21st  Century.  It  is  a
very important statement. But, in fact, there is an  evolving  purpose,  and
there is no point subscribing to tattered, old, tired banners which  we  had
before, and saying that those  banners  represent  what  we  want  in  South
Africa.

I like Mrs Witbooi. I am not patronising her. I think that she has  a  sense
of humour, because when she sat down she started laughing. I think  I  liked
that, because I hope that she had a similar kind of  sense  of  humour  when
her esteemed leader of the Western Cape, the premier, spoke  about  the  New
NP.

I received his speech this morning, and it  is  a  whole  speech  about  the
history of the New NP except that the word ``apartheid'' never  appeared  in
the speech. I hope that she laughed uproariously then, at the conclusion  of
the speech, because it was the biggest apology for  apartheid  that  I  have
heard. Even Mr De Klerk would not have said that  in  1994  and  afterwards,
with that degree of thick-skinnedness. I  applaud  Mrs  Witbooi's  sense  of
humour.

May I also say that one has to be very humorous when one  says:  Why  do  we
not amend these private Acts? There are scores of  private  Acts  and  every
time one has to  change  a  private  Act,  one  must  introduce  an  Act  in
Parliament. How much time will this take, and why should  some  institutions
have this extraordinary privilege of having  special  access  to  Parliament
for historical reasons and take up Parliament's time every  time  they  want
to make a small change? Why should they not do so under  the  principle  and
umbrella of national education legislation? As we said,  they  can  put  the
peculiar virtues and  special  sentiments  of  each  institution  that  they
usually talk to me about in the statutes.

I love these special historically developed sentiments. But let them be  put
into each institution's statute. Nobody is arguing  against  that.  If  Wits
university has a particular historic origin and philosophy  which  it  wants
to maintain, it must go into the statute. Nobody is  arguing  against  this.
Stellenbosch, which until the 1930s had English as a medium  of  instruction
and now  has  a  special  association  with  languages,  can  do  the  same.
Therefore one does not need special Acts.

I have news for Mrs Witbooi. The Association of Vice  Chancellors,  who  are
the real policemen of higher education in universities,  have  accepted  the
principle that these Acts are irrelevant  to  South  Africa  and  should  be
repealed. Why is the New NP fighting a battle when the actual recipients  of
the legislation, the vice chancellors and principals of  universities,  have
said they are perfectly happy? They have stated that this  poses  no  threat
to them as long as they can model their own statutes. I want to  inform  Mrs
Witbooi that one cannot amend these statutes without introducing a  Bill  in
Parliament.

Mr Raju spoke differently this time. He  spoke  with  ringing,  Churchillian
tones.  I  like  that.  He  spoke  like  a  subfusc  Churchill  this   time.
[Laughter.] He spoke with the vigour of Churchill and  ended  up  with  this
rolling thing, saying: ``I'm a good bloke, but even I can't be trusted  with
these enormous powers that I'm given.'' [Laughter.]

Let me tell Mr Raju that this is why, in my  lifetime,  the  DA  will  never
form a government. This is because it does not understand what is  happening
on the ground,  apart  from  the  fact  that  it  does  not  know  what  the
legislation lays down. Since  I  have  been  the  Minister,  for  nearly  26
months, I have been asked by various forces why I do not dismiss  a  council
which is not doing its job. I do not have the power to do so. This  new  Act
does not give me that power. Some have asked why I do  not  dismiss  a  vice
chancellor who is totally authoritarian and built a R50 million building  in
a university without the consent of the council. I do not have the power  to
dismiss or discipline the vice chancellor. Some  have  asked  why  I  cannot
take action when there are wide-scale allegations of corruption.  I  do  not
have the power. I can ask the Public Protector or Auditor-General to do  so.
Some ask why I cannot take action when council members and  the  chairperson
earn between R200 000 and R400  000,  while  membership  of  or  chairing  a
council is a voluntary public service. I do not  have  the  power.  What  we
laid down is that the most a person can get is about a R1 000 a month  apart
from one's expenses.
I am a eunuch in this business.  I  do  not  have  any  power,  but  I  have
responsibility. The UK and Danish ministers for  education  have  much  more
power than I have. Members should remember that we are still in a  reforming
period. In a reforming period one needs power to carry out  policies.  Those
are established democracies. Therefore I would suggest that Mr Raju  does  a
little bit more homework. If he does this he  will  see  that  I  have  very
little power.

I now want to deal with the central issue, and even Churchill  would  accept
this. We have these interim councils for the simple reason that  this  is  a
transition.  In  a  transition  mergers  will  take  place,  there  will  be
programmes transferred from one university  or  technikon  to  another,  and
there will also be development taking place.

How does one bring about those changes, unless the law allows one to set  up
interim councils representing two or three  institutions?  One  cannot  have
the councils all existing and interacting with each other. In Australia  the
government set  up  a  commission  of  inquiry  and,  in  their  belief,  no
institution with fewer than 8 000 students should exist. If there are  fewer
than  8  000  students,  the  institution  should  either  close   down   or
amalgamate. But we did not do that.

What we have done is this. The national working group that is  going  around
the place produced  a  national  plan  in  February  2001.  They  asked  for
comments and got them, and between now and December we will sit  and  decide
what should be the future shape of higher education.

Two institutions in Durban said that they were merging voluntarily. We  have
two technikons next to each other. This is an extraordinary creation of  the
special geography of apartheid. We have two  technikons  literally  next  to
each other with a small fence in between. One could not jump that fence.  It
was easier to jump about the matrimonial bed  than  over  that  fence.  They
have chosen an interim council that will bring about a proper  election  for
the full council.

I believe that we have made a mistake. The six-month period  is  too  short,
but that is the nature of compromises and how we legislate. I might have  to
come back to the Council.

This argument  about  autonomy  is  misplaced.  Autonomy  in  the  political
realities of a transition must allow for change to take place to  carry  out
institutional reorganisation.

Nobody has mentioned academic freedom here. Academic freedom is  freedom  of
a special kind. It is the most  cherished  value  one  can  have  in  higher
education. The right to lecture, to speak, to write by  reference  to  one's
truth, not party-political and partisan. In South  Africa  we  have  written
constitutions and  therefore  we  have  this  extraordinary  right  to  free
speech. Freedom to write and research is quite  different  from  freedom  in
ordinary speech. In France an academic cannot write a book which denies  the
Holocaust. We allow  people  to  say  that  apartheid  was  not  as  bad  as
everybody thinks it was, although nearly 3 million  people  were  ethnically
cleansed, particularly in the Western Cape. In France  one  cannot  write  a
book that denies the Holocaust. It is an  offence  to  write  such  a  book,
whether one is an academic or not. We have a  fuller  range  of  freedom  of
speech. I would rather that members here took part in encouraging the  whole
question of academic freedom than that they went at the tattered  banner  of
autonomy, because the Act of 1996 says that autonomy  must  be  used  in  an
accountable manner.
I am particularly concerned that at medical schools, out of  250  there  are
only 3 or 4 blacks. I am concerned about that. There  is  no  accountability
when medical schools do not create  the  conditions  for  blacks  to  enter.
Instead we send 100 people to Cuba, as we did  yesterday,  to  get  training
there.

I ask the Council to  participate  in  this  enormous  debate  and  vote  in
support of this  Bill.  It  is  necessary  to  move  us  into  a  much  more
democratic, open and representative 21st century. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 18:05.

2.    Report of the Select Committee on Land and  Environmental  Affairs  on
     Study Tours to Kalk Bay, Hout Bay and Saldanha  Bay,  dated  30  August
     2001:


     The  Select  Committee  on  Land  and  Environmental  Affairs,   having
     undertaken study tours to Kalk Bay, Hout Bay and Saldanha Bay on 24 and
     25 May 2001, reports as follows:


     A.     Terms of reference


         In terms of sections 70(1)(b) and  72(1)(a)  of  the  Constitution,
         Parliament   must   make   provision   for   "representative    and
         participatory democracy, accountability,  transparency  and  public
         involvement",  also  "facilitating  public   involvement   in   the
         legislative and other processes" of Parliament.


         Furthermore, in terms of Rule 151(1) of the Rules of  the  National
         Council of Provinces, the Rules  Committee  must  establish  select
         committees to deal with legislation, oversight  and  other  matters
         concerning the affairs of government.


         Therefore,  when  a  letter  from  Ms  A  M  Versfeld  reached  the
         Committee, alleging irregularities in  the  fishing  industry,  the
         Committee decided at a meeting on 4 April 2001 to  undertake  fact-
         finding missions  to  fishing  areas  to  ascertain  from  ordinary
         fisher  folk  what  the  position  was  with   respect   to   these
         irregularities.


     B.     Background


         The function of regulating the fishing industry  resides  with  the
         Marine and Coastal Management (MCM), which is a directorate  within
         the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism.  Part  of  the
         mission statement of MCM reads:
              To provide for responsible  custodianship  of  South  Africa's
              marine and coastal resources and ecosystems for the benefit of
              current and future generations  of  South  Africans.  This  is
              achieved by the conservation of such resources and  ecosystems
              through the control of, and the orderly, fair,  and  equitable
              access to, their optimum sustainable utilisation.


         In the years leading up to the first  democratic  elections,  there
         was a great deal of dissatisfaction with the  management  of  South
         Africa's marine resources. With the advent of the new  dispensation
         in  1994,  steps  were  taken  to  revise  policy  on  the  fishing
         industry, which culminated in the  publication  of  a  White  Paper
         entitled "A Marine Fisheries Policy for South Africa" in May  1997,
         in which the new approach to the industry was outlined.


         Some of the highlights of the new approach were:


         *  Transparency and accountability in marine  resource  management.
              The management of living marine resources and all  aspects  of
              the decision-making process  will  be  open  and  transparent.
              Administrators and stakeholders will be accountable for  their
              actions.


         *  Access to marine resources shall be fair and equitable.


         *  There should  be  a  holistic  approach  to  fisheries  and  the
              utilisation  of  marine  resources,   which   should   include
              addressing historical imbalances.


         *  Acceptable conditions of employment. Holders of  fishing  rights
              will provide  acceptable  conditions  of  employment  for  all
              employees with respect to income, health and safety, training,
              job security, retirement and other employment benefits.


         Coming to the problematic question of  access  and  access  rights,
         the White Paper suggested  the  development  of  a  mechanism  that
         would achieve the following objectives:
         *  Afairer system of allocation of  access  to  rights  to  harvest
              South Africa's living marine resources.


         *  Asystem which ensures greater access to the  resource  by  those
              who have been denied access previously.


         *   Current  holders  of  fishing  rights  to  be   encouraged   to
              restructure their ownership and control to achieve empowerment
              objectives throughout the industry.


         *  Initial allocation of rights to make provision for  a  range  of
              players of varying sizes, to  avoid  excessive  domination  of
              certain fisheries by a few big players.


         Empowerment  objectives  would  be  achieved  by  expanding  equity
         ownership in companies, restructuring  the  industry  in  order  to
         move in the direction of larger  proportions  of  the  quota  being
         sold to  small-scale  fishing  operators  and  helping  small-scale
         operators to improve efficiency.
         It was envisaged  that  equity  ownership  in  companies  could  be
         expanded by allowing a previously  disadvantaged  group  to  buy  a
         significant portion of equity in a large company or for  a  portion
         of the equity  to  be  sold  to  employees  in  terms  of  a  share
         participation scheme.


         The culmination of the review of policy was the  enactment  of  the
         Marine Living Resources  Act  in  1998,  that  sought  to  put  the
         regulation of  the  fishing  industry  on  a  new,  more  equitable
         footing.


         It was against this background that  the  Committee  undertook  its
         tours to the fishing areas of Kalk Bay, Hout Bay and Saldanha Bay.


     C.     Procedure


         The Committee aimed at attaining its objectives by  holding  public
         meetings at Kalk Bay and Hout Bay on 24 May 2001  and  at  Saldanha
         Bay on 25 May 2001. Those attending were  largely  drawn  from  the
         previously disadvantaged communities. The numbers attending  ranged
         from about 50 in Kalk Bay and Hout Bay, respectively, to  about  80
         in Saldanha Bay. Members of the public  made  oral  submissions  to
         the Committee, and in Saldanha Bay these were accompanied  by  some
         written submissions.


         The delegation  that  undertook  the  tours,  consisted  of  Rev  P
         Moatshe, Rev M Chabaku, Mr M L Mokoena, Ms A M Versfeld and Dr E  A
         Conroy, on 24 May, Dr Conroy being replaced by Mr A E  van  Niekerk
         on 25 May  2001.  Committee  Secretary  K  Williams  and  Committee
         Assistant K Tshoma accompanied the delegation on both days.


     D.     Findings


         1. Kalk Bay


              (a) Mr Barry Goodman, a boat-owner,  stated  that  there  were
                  only 45 boats using Kalk Bay  harbour,  and  he  felt  the
                  community should be allowed to  fish  freely  without  any
                  regulation. He also complained of the high-handed  actions
                  of the harbour master, which had led  to  the  sinking  of
                  his boat.
              (b) Mr Trevor Okies of Africa Fishing Industry complained that
                  responses to  applications  for  quotas  were  couched  in
                  inaccessible  language.  Furthermore,  reasons  were   not
                  given when applications were turned down.  They  had  been
                  told that quotas would be easier to obtain if they  formed
                  close corporations, but this had not happened. He  further
                  claimed that persons who were not bona fide  fishers  were
                  obtaining quotas.


              (c) Mrs Christine Trimmel stated that  though  companies  like
                  New District Six had obtained quotas, the benefit  of  the
                  quota did not filter down to the community. She also  felt
                  that  people  were  being  unfairly  penalised  when   not
                  receiving  quotas  because  of  other  employment  besides
                  fishing.


              (d) Mr J Gomez asked that small line-fishers be given a  quota
                  for  baitfish,  as  they  had  to  obtain  these  at   the
                  exorbitant price of R27 per box.


              (e) Mr J Poggenpoel of Marion Dawn Fishing CC complained  that
                  his company's quota for pilchards was not  viable,  as  it
                  did not allow them to maintain their vessel and  crew.  He
                  further complained  that  newcomers  were  getting  bigger
                  quotas than the older companies, and he felt there  should
                  be consistent criteria for determining  the  size  of  the
                  quota.


              (f) Peter Williams echoed  the  views  that  quotas  were  not
                  viable and that  non-fishers  were  obtaining  quotas.  He
                  appealed  for  assistance  in  applying  for  quotas,  and
                  claimed that companies were  not  providing  for  benefits
                  like pension and medical aid.


              (g) Mr A Trimmel felt that quotas were not fairly awarded  and
                  that one had to curry favour with politicians to obtain  a
                  quota. He requested that a channel be made  available  for
                  the  Department  to  receive  complaints   from   ordinary
                  fishers.


              (h) Mr E Rosslind of the Kalk Bay Lobster and Commercial  Line
                  Fishing Association complained that  his  association  had
                  been denied a quota for hake,  even  though  a  court  had
                  ruled that this be granted. Although he acknowledged  that
                  resources were shrinking, he felt that quotas in Kalk  Bay
                  were no longer viable  and  that  newcomers  were  getting
                  more  than  the  older  hands.  He  also  complained  that
                  inappropriate quotas were being granted.


              (i) Mrs B Sackim appealed that widows be granted quotas  since
                  companies did not pay compensation in  the  event  of  the
                  death of their spouses.


              (j) The crew of the Arend B complained about their  conditions
                  of employment in a written submission.


         2. Hout Bay


              (a) Carl  Oppelt  of  Algemene  Vissers  complained  that  the
                  crayfish quota that his company  had  obtained,  had  been
                  cut to accommodate new entrants.  As  a  result,  his  new
                  quota was not viable. Furthermore, a whitefish  quota  had
                  been granted on appeal to Marine and  Coastal  Management.
                  This quota had been withdrawn when there was  a  complaint
                  that it was inadequate.


              (b) Henry Masemola was  a  member  of  the  Bay  View  Fishing
                  Company. He was dropped  from  the  company  when  it  was
                  stated that there were too many members. He received  some
                  money when he resigned. A court  ruled  on  7  April  1998
                  that he had  to  be  taken  back  into  the  company.  The
                  present directors, however,  claim  that  they  are  still
                  evaluating the  company  before  other  members  could  be
                  taken back or compensated further.


                  He also resigned from the Masakhe Company.  He  was  given
                  R5 000 as part payment of the settlement. Although he  was
                  initially assured that the rest of his money would  follow
                  by the end of the year, he has now been told that he  will
                  have to wait for 10 years.


                  He further complained about  the  Oceania  Company.  Three
                  directors of  the  original  30  members  now  manage  the
                  company. He claims that these three utilise  the  identity
                  documents  of  all  30  original  members  when  obtaining
                  quotas. He wants MCM to investigate this.


              (c) Mr Dickie Meter pointed out that the  subsistence  fishers
                  are not able to access lobster because the coast has  been
                  declared a reserve. They are not able to  harvest  in  the
                  deep sea because they cannot afford boats.  As  a  result,
                  they have to resort to poaching. He asked MCM to  consider
                  opening the coastline  to  subsistence  fishers.  He  also
                  felt  that  the  high  cost   of   applying   for   quotas
                  marginalised the poor.


                  Furthermore, he felt that not enough  was  being  done  to
                  build capacity in new  companies.  This  had  resulted  in
                  destructive in-fighting and  corruption.  He  appealed  to
                  MCM to play a role in this regard. He  also  claimed  that
                  corrupt officials were giving  preferential  treatment  to
                  big   companies,   which   marginalised   the   previously
                  disadvantaged.


              (d) Mr N Adams of Olympia  Fishing  claimed  that  quotas  for
                  small, black companies were not  viable.  He  said  viable
                  quotas were given to big businesses with influence in  the
                  Department. He felt that there were remnants  of  the  old
                  regime in MCM who lied to  fishers,  withheld  information
                  from them and were inaccessible.


              (e) Francis Williams of Concordia  Fisheries  complained  that
                  MCM did not explain their rejection  of  applications  for
                  quotas. This led to a futile  repetition  of  applications
                  with the subsequent loss of application fees.


              (f) Mrs S Meter of Blue Fin Holdings stated that since  rights
                  were  granted  for  one  year  only,   her   company   was
                  experiencing difficulty in acquiring  loans.  She  further
                  stated that emerging black  companies  were  granted  non-
                  viable quotas because of the influence of  big  companies.
                  She advised that the quotas of big  companies  be  cut  to
                  provide for the emerging companies. She  further  appealed
                  to MCM to support the  emerging  companies  to  make  them
                  viable.


              (g) Mr E Jones claimed that Bay View  Fishing  used  his  name
                  when applying for a quota.


              (h) Mr J Davids appealed for  the  reserved  coastline  to  be
                  opened to fishers. He also appealed to the Department  not
                  to recruit members from the community to patrol the  area,
                  as this had led to conflict in the community.
              (i) Mrs V Reed of the Hout Bay Widows' Association appealed to
                  MCM to intervene  to  prevent  in-fighting  in  the  newly
                  formed, emerging companies.


              (j) Mr S Cupido highlighted the plight of the Atlantis fishing
                  community. He decried the lack of development at  Atlantis
                  and pointed out that subsistence fishers could not make  a
                  living on four lobsters a  day.  He  appealed  for  viable
                  quotas and assistance with capacity-building for  emerging
                  companies. In this he was supported by Mrs L Lippeurs  and
                  Mr W Solomons, who  suggested  a  communal  permit  to  be
                  issued to subsistence fishers.


              (k) Ms B  Yon  of  the  Hout  Bay  Subsistence  Fishing  Forum
                  complained that there seemed to  be  random  selection  in
                  the awarding of subsistence permits. Clear  criteria  were
                  needed in this respect. She felt that  MCM  could  provide
                  fishers with more information. She also appealed  for  the
                  reserve to be opened or  for  subsistence  fishers  to  be
                  given capital to acquire boats.


         3. Saldanha Bay


              (a) Mr F Louw of Louwville, Vredenburg, claimed the  community
                  was awarded a quota, which resorted under  a  trust.  They
                  were then advised to form  a  close  corporation,  and  89
                  became  shareholders   of   the   newly   formed   Denburg
                  Fisheries. Members then left the company and only five  of
                  the original members continued  to  manage  it.  They  now
                  claim to be bankrupt, but they still get  a  quota,  while
                  those who left, get nothing. The remaining five  have  now
                  formed a new company called Pike Rock Fishing. He  further
                  claimed that these companies do not  pay  compensation  in
                  the case of an accident.


              (b) Mr J Blankenberg of the Subsistence Forum of Lamberts  Bay
                  claimed that a large portion of  the  Saldanha  Bay  quota
                  was unaccounted for. He also claimed it  was  unjust  that
                  pensioners who only  received  small  pensions  should  be
                  denied subsistence permits. He further  asked  that  there
                  should be a moratorium on the issuing of B-licences  until
                  these were fully explained to the community.


              (c) Mr F Tolken of the West Coast Pelagic Fishers claimed that
                  many of the original quota holders, who were organised  in
                  an association, were excluded  when  a  close  corporation
                  was formed, as they could not afford shares. He felt  that
                  fishers should not have to  purchase  shares  before  they
                  could benefit from a quota. He  also  claimed  that  names
                  were being used by  corrupt  directors  to  access  quotas
                  from which no one benefited  but  themselves.  He  further
                  stated  that  inappropriate  quotas  were   granted.   For
                  instance, a chokka permit was given to pelagic fishers.


              (d) Mr A September, another  member  of  the  Pelagic  Fishers
                  Association, was also excluded when the close  corporation
                  was formed. He  claimed  that  members  bought  death  and
                  medical aid cover from Old Mutual  and  Sanlam,  but  they
                  were not compensated for accidents.


              (e) Mr  E  de  Necker  of  Langebaan  Line-fishing  Enterprise
                  claimed that  quotas  were  granted  to  non-fishers  like
                  policemen, army personnel and  teachers,  while  the  bona
                  fide fishers lived in abject poverty.


              (f) Mr E Solomons, a former employee of Southern Seas, part of
                  Premier Fisheries, said that when Southern Seas was  taken
                  over by Sekunjalo, they  were  promised  70%  of  the  new
                  company. Instead, their benefits were  lowered  and  there
                  were retrenchments and unfair  dismissals.  He  said  that
                  Premier Fisheries  was  stealing  fish  and  that  he  had
                  documents to prove this. He wanted  MCM  to  undertake  an
                  investigation into Sekunjalo and Premier Fisheries.


                  He also claimed that shares were paid at  dividends  below
                  their value and  that  Sekunjalo  had  paid  no  dividends
                  since 1997, although the company did make a profit.


              (g)  Mrs  E  Mavusa  of  Berg  River  Fisheries  claimed  that
                  dividends have not been paid to shareholders  since  1997,
                  even though the company purchased an expensive  boat.  She
                  also claimed that shareholders were not consulted  in  the
                  running of the company and were  given  no  indication  of
                  the quotas granted to the company.


              (h) Mr F Jooste of Siphiwe Fisheries claimed that all evidence
                  of the granting of a whitefish quota to  his  company  had
                  simply disappeared.


              (i) Mr F Lisse of the Line Fishers of Saldanha  and  the  West
                  Coast complained about the high cost of  applications  for
                  quotas.  He  also  wanted  the  application  forms  to  be
                  simplified. He appealed to MCM to regulate  the  marketing
                  of fish so that undercutting could be prevented.


              (j) Mrs Elena Pyper complained of the loss  of  her  husband's
                  catch right, since catch rights were not  catered  for  in
                  the new legislation (Marine Living Resources Act).


              (k)  Mr  J  Issel  stated  that  there  was  in-fighting   and
                  corruption in  the  newly  formed,  empowerment  companies
                  because MCM did not support them directly or intervene  to
                  prevent  malpractices.  He  claimed  that  many   of   the
                  instances of malpractice were the result of big  companies
                  corrupting individuals in the  empowerment  companies.  He
                  also  appealed  to  MCM  to  engage  in  capacity-building
                  exercises within the empowerment companies.


              (l) Mrs E Jordaan of La Ponterose Fisheries claimed  that  the
                  quota granted to the company in 1998-99 disappeared  after
                  the old  quota  holder  made  a  court  case  against  the
                  granting of  the  quota  to  them.  She  appealed  to  the
                  Department to look into this matter, as  the  company  had
                  no funds to engage lawyers.


              (m) Mr N Cloete of Walpat CC claimed that although  the  names
                  of 33 persons were used to obtain  quotas,  only  half  of
                  them had received any money  from  the  quota  other  than
                  income   from   the   catch   itself.   He   wanted   this
                  investigated. (Walpat CC has since submitted documents  to
                  the Committee.)


              (n) Mr J Jantjies of Stompneusbaai Fisheries  complained  that
                  reasons were never given for the  refusal  of  quotas.  He
                  also felt that quotas were given to individuals  with  the
                  right connections.


              (o) Mrs E Boyers stated that her husband, who had  worked  for
                  Denburg Fisheries, was not compensated after an  accident.
                  She wanted an investigation into  the  company.  She  also
                  felt that quotas were granted to inappropriate people  who
                  earned large  salaries,  while  fishers  lived  in  abject
                  poverty.


              (p) Ms A Smit claimed that Vredenburg Fishers Corporation  was
                  being run without consulting the general members.


              (q) Mr C Jordaan, a subsistence fisher  from  St  Helena  Bay,
                  said that a forum was formed for subsistence fishers.  The
                  management collected R60 from all permit holders  for  the
                  purchase of utility vehicles, which they used  exclusively
                  for themselves.


              (r) Mrs Farmer, a wife of a St Helena Bay line fisher, claimed
                  that quotas were awarded to corrupt people who  squandered
                  their income on luxuries,  while  the  fishers  remain  in
                  abject poverty.


              (s) Mr J H Meter of Louwenians Fisheries complained of tension
                  between the managers  of  the  corporation,  and  required
                  intervention  from   the   Department   to   resolve   the
                  situation. He also alleged that Southern Seas and  Premier
                  Fisheries did not pay dividends to shareholders,  although
                  their names were still used to acquire quotas.


              (t) Mr G Smith of Louwville, Vredenburg, felt that quotas were
                  allocated to undeserving persons, while  ordinary  fishers
                  were given no  reason  why  their  applications  had  been
                  refused. He wished that  the  Department  investigate  the
                  awarding of quotas on the West Coast.


              (u) Mr X Mcinga and Mr  V  Moyake  made  written  submissions,
                  accusing  Southern  Seas  and  Premier  Fisheries  of  not
                  honouring their pension  pay-out  obligations.  Mr  Mcinga
                  also accused Premier Fisheries of not paying dividends  on
                  his shares.


              (v) Mrs M Don, in a written submission, appealed  for  permits
                  to be given  to  ordinary  fishers  and  not  to  doctors,
                  lawyers and priests. She also asked  that  the  Department
                  institute a help desk  to  assist  ordinary  fishers  with
                  applications.


              (w) Mr J Erasmus of St  Helena  Bay  alleged  that  Dromedaris
                  Fisheries did not pay members the full  amount  for  their
                  crayfish catches in 2000. He also accused the  chairperson
                  of selling the hake, sardine and  anchovy  quotas  without
                  any payment to members.  He  asked  for  an  investigation
                  into the company.


              (x) Mr J Samuels, in a written  submission,  complained  about
                  his exclusion from Hopefield  Fishing  Development,  which
                  is now run by non-fishers. He claimed that fishers'  names
                  were used to obtain a quota  in  1998,  but  that  members
                  were not informed of this and received no income from it.


              (y) Mr J  Coetzee,  in  a  written  submission,  said  that  a
                  mysterious payment of R250 was made to former  members  of
                  the  Hopefield  Fishers'  Co-operative  after  they   were
                  supposed to have resigned from the corporation. He  needed
                  clarity on what was due to him.


              (z) Mr Christie Klaase, in a written submission,  claims  that
                  he was unfairly dismissed from CBL Midas, which is run  by
                  two quota holders, Mr Lukas Strauss and Mr Bertus  Cloete.
                  He also claims that the conditions  of  service  which  he
                  was offered when taken into their employ were never met.


     E.     Conclusions


         Despite the often  unsystematic  nature  of  the  submissions,  the
         Committee is of the opinion that:
         1. there is evidence of irregularities with respect to the  use  of
              names on applications for quotas, the disappearance of certain
              quotas, and the non-payment  of  dividends,  compensation  and
              pensions;


         2. the granting of quotas to  non-fishers,  the  granting  of  non-
              viable and inappropriate quotas, and the fact that  no  reason
              is given when an application is refused, cause dissatisfaction
              and frustration;


         3. a lack of intervention by and support  from  MCM  leads  to  in-
              fighting  and  corruption   in   newly   formed,   empowerment
              companies;


         4. the conditions of employment of some fishers  are  unacceptable;
              and


         5. the present arrangements with  respect  to  subsistence  fishers
              causes undue hardship.


     F.     Recommendations


         The Committee recommends that:


         1. MCM investigate the alleged irregularities with respect  to  the
              use of names  when  obtaining  quotas,  the  disappearance  of
              certain quotas, and the non-payment of dividends, compensation
              and pensions;


         2. the granting of quotas be made  more  transparent  by  providing
              reasons for the  refusal  of  applications  (also,  a  greater
              percentage of bona fide fishers should receive quotas);


         3. small companies reap the benefit of cutting the  quotas  of  big
              companies, which will ensure that they obtain viable quotas;


         4. application forms for quotas be simplified, application fees  be
              lowered, and a help-desk  be  instituted  to  assist  ordinary
              fishers with applications (MCM should become  more  accessible
              to ordinary fishers);


         5. quotas be granted for a period of longer than one year;


         6. the Hout Bay coastline be opened to subsistence fishers;


         7. a communal permit be considered for subsistence fishers;


         8. pensioners who receive small  pensions  be  granted  subsistence
              permits;


         9. small line-fishers be granted permits  for  bait-fish,  or  that
              the price of bait-fish be regulated;


         10.      the  actions  of  the  harbour  master  at  Kalk  Bay   be
              investigated;


         11.      the  conditions  of  employment  on   the   Arend   B   be
              investigated;


         12.     MCM support newly formed companies  with  capacity-building
              for the enhancement of managerial skills (intervention in  the
              case of in-fighting is also advised); and


         13.      MCM  interact  with   the   Committee   to   discuss   the
              implementation of these recommendations.

         The  Select  Committee  on  Security  and  Constitutional  Affairs,

         referred to it, reports the Bill  with  a  proposed  amendment,  as
         follows:


         CLAUSE 30


     (1)    On page 10,  from  line  16,  to  omit  subsection  (4)  and  to
         substitute:


           (4)(a)       Notwithstanding  subsection  (1),  if  the   prison
                       population in general or in a  particular  prison  is
                       reaching such  proportions  that  the  safety,  human
                       dignity and physical care of the prisoners are  being
                       affected   materially,   the   Minister,   with   the
                       concurrence of the Minister of  Justice,  may  direct
                       that any group of unsentenced prisoners be released.
               (b)     A direction contemplated in paragraph (a)  may  only
                       be issued if the Minister and the Minister of Justice
                       are satisfied that-
                       (i)   in respect of each of the prisoners  concerned,
                            the relevant court has  not  refused  to  grant
                            bail;
                       (ii)  the prisoners concerned are not being  detained
                            in respect of-
                            (aa)  any offence referred to in Schedule 2  of
                                  the Correctional Services Act,  1959  (Act
                                  No. 8 of 1959);
                            (bb)   domestic  violence  as  defined  in  the

                                  of 1998); or;

                                  may prescribe by regulation; and
                       (iii) there are no  other  cases  being  investigated
                              against any such prisoner  in  respect  of  an
                              offence contemplated in subparagraph (ii).
               (c)     When a prisoner is released under paragraph (a)  the
                       head of  the  prison  where  the  prisoner  is  being
                       detained must-
                       (i)   serve a  summons  on  the  prisoner  to  appear
                            before the court and on the date and at a  time
                            specified in the warrant of detention; and
                       (ii)  explain the contents  of  the  summons  to  the
                            prisoner.
               (d)     A copy of the summons must be forwarded to the clerk
                       of the court in question who must attach the copy  to
                       the record of proceedings, and  such  copy  shall  be
                       prima facie proof that the summons was served on  and
                       explained to the prisoner concerned.
               (e)      If  a  prisoner  fails  to  appear  in   court   as
                       contemplated in paragraph (c), the court may issue  a
                       warrant for the arrest of that prisoner.
                  (f)  Sections 67 and 67A of the  Criminal  Procedure  Act,
                       1977 (Act No. 51 of 1977), apply with  the  necessary
                       changes in respect  of  a  prisoner  contemplated  in
                       paragraph (e).

ANNOUNCEMENTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    The Speaker and the Chairperson:


     (1)      The   Minister   of   Trade   and   Industry   submitted   the
         Wysigingswetsontwerp op Handelswaremerke [W 33 -  2001]  (Nasionale
         Vergadering - art 75) to the  Speaker  and  the  Chairperson  on  4
         October 2001. This is the official translation of  the  Merchandise
