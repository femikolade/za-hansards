               CONGRATULATIONS AND GOOD WISHES TO SPORTSPEOPLE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council, noting that sport-loving South  Africans  have  a  busy
  weekend ahead -


  (1) congratulates one of South Africa's  great  footballers,  Jomo  Sono,
       owner of Jomo Cosmos, on his recent appointment by CAF (Confederation
       of African Football) as selector/coach for a squad  representing  the
       SADC  footballing  nations  -  a  unique  honour  which  signals  the
       elevation of South African football and South African  sport  to  new
       heights of recognition in world football;


  (2) further congratulates the finalists of the Bob-Save Cup Final, Santos
       of Cape Town and Sundowns of Tshwane, awaiting with keen anticipation
       a showcase final at the FNB stadium tomorrow  afternoon,  this  as  a
       starter for an equally mouthwatering  top-class  match  when  two  of
       South Africa's charismatic teams, Orlando Pirates and Kaiser  Chiefs,
       lock horns yet again;


  (3) sends its good wishes to all the runners  from  all  corners  of  the
       world who will be participating  in  the  now  world-famous  Comrades

         a  container  crammed  with  approximately  R3  million  worth   of
         Patagonian toothfish and illegally caught crayfish;


     (2)    notes that the container was waiting to be exported to  the  USA

           of the law; and


       (b)  as a matter of urgency, to make use of legislation providing for
           the  seizure  of  the  assets  of  those  responsible  for  drug
           manufacturing and drug dealing.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

               SOUTH AFRICAN SPORTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL
                          SOUTH AFRICAN BOXING BILL

               (Consideration of Bills and of Reports thereon)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  Members,  I
have just been informed that there is only one speakers' list for  Orders  1
and 2.

I take this opportunity to  welcome  the  hon  the  Minister  of  Sport  and
Recreation and also special delegates from provinces, including the MECs.

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION:  Chairperson,  MECs  present,  special
delegates and hon members, I present to this House two  Bills  for  members'
consideration. The first of these Bills,  the  South  African  Boxing  Bill,
deals with professional boxing in our country, while the second one  relates
to amendments necessary to the South African Sports Commission Act of  1998.
This amendment provides  for  a  streamlining  of  the  composition  of  the
commission, and ensures a greater degree of accountability to the  executive
authority.

Professional boxing is the only  sport  that  is  regulated  by  an  Act  of
Parliament. Currently, the Boxing and  Wrestling  Control  Act,  Act  39  of
1954, is intended, in particular, to look after the interests  of  the  most
vulnerable  constituency  in  the  boxing  fraternity,  namely  the   boxers
themselves. The current legislation, however, has numerous shortcomings.

The Act is amongst the oldest pieces of legislation  still  on  the  Statute
Book from the apartheid era. Instead of promoting the sport,  it  serves  to
hinder and obstruct the  growth  and  development  of  professional  boxing.
Moreover, in many respects, it is simply unconstitutional.

This Bill paves the way for, amongst other things, a  streamlined  procedure
that will cement our future as a global player in  professional  boxing.  It
rids us of a structure that  does  not  serve  the  best  interests  of  the
primary stakeholders in sport, the boxers themselves. Furthermore, it  lifts
the prohibition on female boxing, a clause in the current  Act  that  is  in
conflict with our Constitution.

More than that, the South African Boxing Bill will ensure the effective  and
efficient administration of professional boxing, and  create  the  mechanism
for a synergy between boxing  in  the  paid  ranks  and  amateur  boxing,  a
feature that is currently lacking in the legislation. The Bill provides  for
the establishment of a boxing commission to  be  known  as  Boxing  SA,  and
allows all role-players the  right  to  organise  within  their  own  ranks.
Boxers, managers, trainers, officials  and  promoters  will  now  enjoy  the
right to form associations or a federation of associations  to  serve  their
respective interests.

It is no secret that the vast majority of professional  boxers  struggle  to
eke out an existence. On their retirement, many boxers are  destitute,  with
nothing to show for their  years  of  dedication  to  the  sport  and  their
sacrifices in the  ring.  They  become  mere  statistics,  and  face  a  new
struggle for survival once their competitive days are over.  One  can  think
of boxers like Anthony `Blue Jaguar' Morodi here, Happyboy  Mgxaji,  Tap-Tap
Makhathini, and a host of other boxers,  including  Beshu  Sibaqa  from  the
Western Cape.
The new Bill will seek to prevent that. It is also  an  attempt  to  address
the inequities that exist between the boxer and the other  role-players  who
benefit from the exploits of the former without being subjected  to  dangers
in the ring. The Bill also seeks to provide for  a  smooth  transition  from
amateur boxing to the  professional  ranks,  thus  putting  a  halt  to  the
uncontrolled exploitation of young boxers  by  unscrupulous  matchmakers.  I
want to mention here a case of one boxer who is one of  our  top  boxers  in
South Africa now, who started boxing at the age of  11.  That  is  just  not
correct.

Under the existing Act, professional boxing  has  been  bleeding  profusely.
The rights of boxers  have  been  trampled  upon  by  their  obligations  to
agents, promoters and other beneficiaries who often ignored and  disregarded
them. The South African Boxing Bill is an attempt to rectify that  situation
and, furthermore, provide for  an  effective  dispute  resolution  mechanism
that is currently lacking.

The independence of Boxing SA is guaranteed by  this  Bill,  and  Boxing  SA
will have jurisdiction over all national and  international  fights  in  the
Republic of South Africa. The Bill creates the mechanism for  the  effective
marketing of boxing, both as a sport and as a business, and  it  provides  a
framework for the establishment  of  infrastructure  that  will  ensure  the
growth and development of professional boxing.

Professional boxing in the provinces stands to gain tremendously  from  this
new Bill once it is enacted. It lays down the framework  for  effective  and
efficient administration at national level, and creates mechanisms vital  to
the marketing and promotion of the sport. This will have a major  impact  on
the relationship between the national controlling body  and  the  provincial
boxing structures.

Members will be aware that over the last two years  numerous  problems  were
experienced as a result of the virtual  collapse  of  boxing  administration
nationally. This necessitated  various  interventions.  Provinces  were  not
left unscathed by this, and it is my belief that this Bill will  go  a  long
way towards preventing similar disruptive actions.

This Bill only  provides  for  professional  boxing  at  a  national  level.
However, this does not mean  that  provincial  boxing  will  be  left  in  a
vacuum. On the contrary, boxing in the provinces is the  very  lifeblood  of
the sport and,  in  order  to  ensure  continuity  and  the  least  possible
disruption, provincial boxing will continue to be administered according  to
the existing Act for the time being.

This does not mean that it will not also change. I intend tackling the  need
for legislation for  the  administration  of  provincial  boxing  through  a
process of consultation with all the relevant stakeholders,  including  MECs
responsible for sport and recreation,  as  well  as  provincial  controlling
bodies.

This process will start as early as 25 June 2001, when I meet with the  MECs
in Minmec. I will be guided by the contributions of  the  province  in  this
regard, and legislation to be introduced to Parliament  will  stipulate  how
boxing will be regulated in the provinces, and how  provincial  boxing  will
relate to boxing at national level. In this I would like to  see  a  synergy
of what is happening at national level being built  together  with  what  is
happening at the provincial level.

I cannot see that this Bill should pose any problem to anybody. It  reflects
the principles enshrined in our Constitution, and  protects  the  rights  of
participants as citizens of our country. I present to the  hon  members  the
South African Boxing Bill.

In much the same way that the South African Boxing Bill  provides  for  more
effective administration, the  South  African  Sports  Commission  Amendment
Bill will improve the potential of the commission to play a pivotal role  in
the  effective  administration  of  sport  and  recreation  throughout   the
country.

Currently, the SA Sports Commission co-exists with a smaller department  now
known as Sports and Recreation South Africa. It became necessary  to  review
the size and composition of the SA Sports Commission as  stipulated  in  the
principal Act, and to entrench the functions  and  the  responsibilities  of
the executive authority.

Members will notice that I have mentioned the executive authority  regarding
both of these pieces of legislation. There is  absolutely  no  way  that  we
cannot consolidate the gains that we have made over the years.  We  have  to
do that to make sure that things move the way they are supposed to.

Given the fact that the chief executive officer, appointed at the  level  of
director-general, can adequately perform the main thrust  of  the  functions
of the commission, a review was needed of the roles of the  chairperson  and
the deputy chairperson of the commission. It  also  became  evident  that  a
board of 30 commissioners is an unwieldy and costly structure, and  that  it
is necessary to structure the board not on the basis of representation,  but
rather on that of the expertise necessary to fulfil the vital functions.

The  South  African  Sports  Commission  Amendment  Bill   will   contribute
immensely toward allowing me to fulfil my responsibilities as  the  managing
director of sport, as stipulated in the Public Finance  Management  Act.  It
provides for the reduction of  the  number  of  commissioners  to  12,  with
commissioners being appointed or elected on the basis  of  their  skills  or
expertise in areas of sport and recreation, policy  formulation,  management
and international relations. This will provide for more efficient  decision-
making and a consequent  improvement  in  delivery  to  their  clients,  the
national federations and other macro sport bodies.

The provision in the amending Bill for  a  general  assembly,  as  a  sports
parliament   of   South   Africa,   will    further    enhance    democracy,
representativeness and accountability.

The Bill further provides for greater  accountability  in  the  commission's
financial matters, bringing it in line with the PFMA  and  related  Treasury
requirements. It is my contention that this amending Bill will  improve  the
potential of the commission to play a vital role  in  developing  sport  and
recreation from grass roots to gold.

At the launch of the commission on  Thursday,  15  March,  I  described  the
event as the birth of a new life for South  African  sport.  But  more  than
that, it creates  the  mechanisms  for  a  co-ordinated  approach  to  sport
throughout the country.

Pivotal to this is the growth and development of sport in our provinces.  In
recent times we  have  noticed  an  increasing  reluctance  and  hedging  by
certain sports codes to give effect to transformation in provinces. This  is
a major concern to me. The SA Sports Commission  can,  and  should,  play  a
central role in this, not  only  in  a  monitoring  capacity,  but  also  by
overseeing the processes of transformation. It thus calls  for  greater  co-
operation between the  SA  Sports  Commission  and  the  provinces  and  for
creative mechanisms to  ensure  effective  lines  of  communication  between
national and provincial structures.

There are provinces considering the formation of  sports  councils,  to  co-
ordinate sporting codes within provinces. Given the fact that  the  National
Sports Council has dissolved, this could be a possible  option.  However,  I
am of the view that we need to engage in discussions with the provinces  and
the SA Sports Commission to address  the  matter  of  relationships  between
provinces and national structures.

I therefore present to hon  members  the  South  African  Sports  Commission
Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister, hon  Special  Delegates  and  hon
colleagues, granted hon Minister, that sport in SA played  a  divisive  role
under the unlamented apartheid regime, the days when a  Japanesejockey,  was
granted honorary white status, to be able to ride in an  international  race
meeting in the Republic. The darkest day in  South  African  sport,  when  a
true-blooded cricketer, none other than Cape Town's  own  Basil  d'Oliveira,
had to be hounded out of his motherland as persona non-grata,  in  order  to
play international cricket as a member of the MCC.

The shameful day when the  humble  illiterate  Indian  golfer  from  Durban,
Papwa Sewgolum, was presented with his trophy in pouring  rain  outside  the
Durban Country Club premises after  he  won  the  Natal  Open  Championship,
defeating the great white golfer, Gary Player in the process. It was an  act
of legislation, the obnoxious  Group  Areas  Act,  that  dictated  that  the
Durban Country Club premises were for whites only.

Those were days hon Minister, when the government of the  day  made  it  its
nasty business to interfere in the lives of South Africans  in  every  which
way as possible. No privacy was sacrosanct.

Why do I recount those unsavoury  acts  that  sportsmen  of  colour  had  to
endure in SA. It is precisely for the  reasons  that  this  Government  must
beware,  that  it  does  not  become  another  replica  of  an   interfering
government, with a phobia  for  centralising  control  of  everything,  from
sport to gold mining. Quite frankly, what we need in SA, is less  government
and more power to the  people.  Few  Commissions  and  more  space  for  the
sporting fraternities to exercise their own choices.  Especially  in  sport,
government must be less visible. The Ministry of Sport and  Recreation  must
not usurp the territory of the Minister of Safety  and  Security,  where  of
course, greater visible policing is of paramount importance.

While SA is a fledgling democracy,  South  Africans  are  mature  enough  to
follow the dictates of what true democracy expects of how  they  handle  and
manage  their  affairs  to  the  satisfaction   of   their   constituencies.
Government interference must  be  taboo.  The  Boxing  Commission  true,  is
intended to put right what is perceived to be flawed and deficient  in  many
respects, but commissions, as a rule, ring alarm bells.

I hasten to acknowledge that  I  have  no  doubt  whatsoever  of  the  noble
intentions of the hon Minister. I am certain, as a former rugby and  cricket
player himself, who was of course,  like  so  many  heroic  South  Africans,
denied access to national colours, for reasons  of  colour  of  course,  the
Minister understands  fully  the  folly  of  interference  from  government,
however well-meaning they may be. My party has  a  problem  because  in  the
words of the Minister himself, he is going to become the  Managing  Director
of Sport, and that would of necessity, mean interfering in  the  running  of
sport. [Interjections.] Surely, the consolidation and progress in sport,  is
not the terrain of government. It is the terrain of sportspeople  themselves
and I am sure, given this  space  and  opportunity,  they  would  act  in  a
responsible fashion.

The  Government's  interest  in  the  development  of  talent  among   South
Africans, is welcome and appreciated. The  Governments  underlining  of  the
importance of performances by SA sportsmen and sportswomen  in  the  highest
international forums of the world is well-taken. The opening of the door  to
women boxers, as an interesting act of empowerment. We agree that  in  terms
of the Constitution, it is an imperative that the aspect of gender  equality
be fully recognised and ensured that it is on the right line.  What  is  not
clear  of  course,  is  whether  they  will  be  confined  to   heavyweight,
welterweight, lightweight or featherweight. Or will it be cruiserweight?

Unfortunately because of the aspect of  government  interference,  which  is
quite clear, my party cannot support the Boxing Bill. [Interjections.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister, hon  members  of  this  House
and hon officials from the department, the  Bill  before  this  House,  once
promulgated, will replace the current Act and will be  known  as  the  South
African Boxing Act. It will address sports nationally, but because sport  is
a concurrent interest, another Bill, we are told, will be  drafted  soon  to
deal with sports provincially.

Boxing SA will consist of no fewer than four and no more than seven  members
appointed by the Minister on a part-time basis.  The  Bill  makes  provision
for  the  payment  of  an  annual  honorarium  or  allowance,  and  for  the
reimbursement of expenses incurred by such members.

The Bill also makes provision for women's boxing. However,  the  regulations
governing women's boxing that are currently being  compiled  will  be  aimed
particularly at the safety aspect of the women, so  that  the  battering  of
women boxers does not happen.

Boxing SA will include a legal adviser, a medical doctor and an  auditor  to
ensure  that  issues  are  dealt  with  properly  and  as  expeditiously  as
possible. This Bill is an improvement over the previous Act,  and  the  UCDP
supports it. [Applause.]

The South African Sports Commission Amendment Bill  seeks  to  regulate  the
composition of the South African Sports Commission so  that  the  number  of
commissioners is reduced from 30 to 12. The reason  for  this  reduction  is
the need for efficiency and effectiveness. The general assembly,  comprising
federations and associations, will appoint six members, while the other  six
will be appointed by the Minister from each of the following  categories  of
people:  people  from  rural  areas,  women  and  Boxing  SA,  persons  with
disabilities, persons with a good knowledge and experience of  international
relations, persons with  a  good  knowledge  of  and  experience  in  policy
formulations and Nocsa. These people will be selected on the basis of  their
expertise and commitment to developing sports in South Africa. It  is  hoped
that they will contribute  immensely  to  providing  an  efficient  delivery
system.

The UCDP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mnr die Voorsitter, dit was vir my baie interessant  om
te sien, terwyl die vorige spreker gepraat het, hoe koning  Mokoena  na  hom
gekyk het, veral toe hy gepraat het van die voorsorg  wat  getref  word  dat
vroue nie te na gekom sal word deur die nuwe boksregulasies nie.

Die wetsontwerp oor boks in Suid-Afrika het  baie  goeie  bedoelings  om  'n
nuwe  struktuur  te  skep  vir  al  die  rolspelers  in   professionele   en
amateurboks in Suid-Afrika, en om die nuwe kommissie, naamlik Boks  SA,  tot
stand te bring, maar dit beoog veral  om  beter  interaksie  en  verhoudings
tussen boksers, bestuurders, afrigters, promotors en beamptes tot  stand  te
bring.

Die vraag is egter of hierdie wetsontwerp voldoen aan die behoeftes van  die
mense  wat  hy  moet  dien,  met  ander  woorde  die  boksers,  bestuurders,
afrigters, promotors en beamptes. Ons erken, in 'n baie groot mate  doen  hy
dit, maar ongelukkig is daar ook 'n probleem.  Alhoewel  daar  konsensus  is
ten opsigte van talle belangrike aspekte, ignoreer dit basiese  insette  van
provinsiale sportdepartemente en ander spesialiste in die bokswêreld,  veral
ten opsigte van wie die komplekse verhoudings in boks moet reguleer  en  hoe
dit gedoen moet word.

Ten spyte van die uitgebreide  konsultasieproses,  en  dit  was  werklik  'n
uitgebreide konsultasieproses, van die boks-transformasiespan en ander boks-
indaba's of insette deur  boksverteenwoordigers  by  die  portefeuljekomitee
blyk dit dat die beroep wat die boksgemeenskap  gedoen  het  om  demokraties
hulle eie leiers te kies om hulle te reguleer geïgnoreer is.

Alhoewel die agb Minister sekere versekerings hieroor aangebied het, kan  'n
bus hom mos nou môre doodry, en dan is daar niks van  die  goeie  bedoelings
van die agb Minister in die Wetboek nie. Daarna sal ons verseker  moet  kyk,
want die agb Minister, al is hy ook hóé goed en  al  is  sy  bedoelings  hóé
goed, kan nie namens die mense teen hulle wil hierdie besluite neem nie.

Alhoewel die wetsontwerp 'n groot verbetering is  op  die  wet  van  '54  en
alhoewel outydse regulasies verwyder word,  is  dit  onaanvaarbaar  dat  die
Minister die mag in eie hande neem en namens die mense besluit,  al  is  dit
teen hulle wil. Ons sê mos almal, en veral in sport stem ons  daarmee  saam,
``The people shall govern.'' [Tussenwerpsels.]  Dieselfde  argument  wat  ek
nou hier geopper het, geld ook vir die wysigingswetsontwerp  oor  die  Suid-
Afrikaanse sportkommissie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mr Chairman, what I  found  very  interesting  to  see,
when the previous speaker was speaking, was the way that  King  Mokoena  was
looking at him, particularly when he spoke  about  the  care  that  must  be
taken so that women will not be detrimentally affected  by  the  new  boxing
regulations.

The South African Boxing Bill has very good  intentions,  to  create  a  new
structure for all the role-players in professional  and  amateur  boxing  in
South Africa, and to establish the new commission, namely Boxing SA, but  it
envisages in particular to bring  about  better  interaction  and  relations
between boxers, trainers, promoters and officials.

However, the question is whether this Bill complies  with  the  requirements
of the  people  it  must  serve,  in  other  words,  the  boxers,  managers,
trainers, promoters and officials. We acknowledge  that  it  does  so  to  a
large degree, but unfortunately there is also a problem. Although  there  is
consensus  in  respect  of  many  important  aspects,   it   ignores   basic
contributions by the provincial sports departments and other specialists  in
the world of boxing, especially with  regard  to  who  should  regulate  the
complex relations in boxing and how this should be done.

In spite of the extended  consultation  process,  and  this  was  really  an
extended consultation process, by the boxing transformation team  and  other
boxing indabas or contributions by boxing representatives at  the  portfolio
committee, it seems as if the appeal by the boxing community  democratically
to select their own leaders to regulate them was ignored.

Although the hon the  Minister  gave  certain  assurances  in  this  regard,
surely a bus could run him over tomorrow and then  nothing  remains  in  the
Statute Book of the good intentions of the hon the Minister. This  we  shall
most certainly have to look at, because the hon the Minister,  even  if  his
intentions are really good, cannot make these decisions  on  behalf  of  the
people against their will.

Although the Bill is a great improvement on the 1954 Act and  although  old-
fashioned regulations  are  being  removed,  it  is  unacceptable  that  the
Minister may take the power into his own hands and make decisions on  behalf
of those people, even if this is against their will. Surely we all say,  and
especially in sport  we  agree  with  this,  ``The  people  shall  govern.''
[Interjections.] The same argument that I have raised  here  now  also  goes
for the South African Sports Commission Amendment Bill.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L  Mushwana):  Order!  Hon  member,
would you please take your seat for a while. On what point are  you  rising,
hon member?

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, could the unintelligible hon Van Niekerk  take  a
brilliant question from this side of the Chamber?
Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I am prepared to take  a  question  if  the
ANC agrees that I take some of their time to complete my speech.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  No,  there  is
no such thing. [Laughter.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Then I will take it later on.

Om presies dieselfde rede en dieselfde argument wat  ook  geld  ten  opsigte
van die wysigingswetsontwerp oor die Suid-Afrikaanse sportkommissie  sal  ek
ongelukkig nou die agb Minister 'n bloedneus moet gee  en  sê  die  Nuwe  NP
stem teen  albei  die  wetsontwerpe.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[For precisely the same reason and because of  the  same  argument  that  is
also valid in respect of  the  South  African  Sports  Commission  Amendment
Bill, I will unfortunately have to give the hon the Minister a  bloody  nose
and say that the New NP is voting against both Bills.]
Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister, MECs and colleagues, the  question
of sport is not child's play. Our intention, and the  national  agenda  that
we have, is to transform sports. One of the issues is that we need to  unify
the country, and we see sport as the major vehicle  through  which  we  must
reach our actual objective.

I would like to make a special appeal to the hon members  to  please  attend
whenever there are briefings  through  the  departments  together  with  the
committee, so that they can be on board.  I  would  like  to  urge  them  to
attend, participate and take sport seriously.  There  are  millions  of  our
children out there who would like to at least benefit from this. If we  play
as public representatives, but do not take sport seriously, it then  becomes
a serious issue.

I was going to start with the  South  African  Sports  Commission  Amendment
Bill, but I am forced to start with a  brief  input  on  the  South  African
Boxing Bill. I do not think that anybody can  seriously  question  the  need
for any government to intervene and regulate the boxing profession in  their
country.  South  Africa  is  no  exception.  The  reasons   for   Government
intervention are quite obvious.

Over the decades, as the Minister has already  said,  boxing  has  generated
enormous wealth for a handful of boxers while the majority  of  professional
boxers have been left destitute, penniless and punch-drunk.  Anticompetitive
and fraudulent business practices appear to be the  norm,  and  professional
boxers are subjected to exploitation daily.

Contrary to what the lay  public  may  believe,  great  boxers  who  command
attention and influence are few and far between. The absence of real  money-
making ability leaves the average boxer with little choice but to  latch  on
to a promoter. A promoter who  has  provided  money  and  support  for  many
years, and consistently lines  up  bouts,  will  have  great  influence  and
control.

Promoters are well aware of their power and  some  take  full  advantage  of
that. Some promoters use option contracts that tie the boxers to them for  a
number of years. At times the boxers must accept  the  promoter's  relatives
as managers and trainers and give them  a  third  or  more  of  every  fight
purse.

It has been said that some promoters make boxers sign blank  contracts  with
the terms filled in later. Even a boxer who is not controlled by a  promoter
may quickly become indentured. Some promoters, who control champions,  force
challengers to sign up with them as a  precondition  to  obtaining  a  title
fight.

Of similar concern is the sanctioning  of  organisations  that  designate  a
champion and rank challengers. Often rankings are  not  based  on  objective
talent or  on  win-loss  records.  Rather,  boxers  who  belong  to  certain
promoters may be highly ranked regardless of skill and  ability.  A  fighter
could be the best in his weight class, but if he is not associated with  the
right promoter or if he does not stick to the rules, he may not be ranked.

This creates fraud that can have deadly consequences. What is advertised  as
a major championship battle turns out to be nothing  more  than  a  mismatch
between a tough experienced boxer and an inferior one. A case  in  point  is
the November 13, 1982, bout between Ray ``Boom Boom'' Mancini  and  Duk  Koo
Kim  of  South  Korea.  Mancini  knocked  out  Kim,   who   never   regained
consciousness and died. Amazingly, Kim had been rated as a top contender  by
the WBA despite the  fact  that  he  was  not  even  among  Korea's  40  top
fighters.

Finally, boxing possesses  no  governing  body  or  league  structures;  the
collective organisation of boxers is  nonexistent;  and  rules,  regulations
and their enforcement vary from province to province.

The South African Boxing Bill seeks to address the  problems  which  I  have
pointed out. It will  establish  uniform  rules  which  will  apply  to  all
boxers, promoters, trainers,  managers,  officials  and  other  stakeholders
involved in boxing. This is an intervention which may  have  come  a  little
late for boxers who have been exploited in the past, but it will  definitely
be welcomed by all those who  have  a  genuine  interest  in  the  sport  of
boxing.

With this I would like to say that we support the Boxing Bill.  I also  need
to make clear that when we debated this at committee level,  we  agreed.  We
do not change in the House; we should change at committee level.

The SA Sports Commission is the chief agency leading South Africa to  world-
class sporting excellence. This it seeks to do  by  improving  opportunities
for all South Africans to participate  in  sport  and  recreation.  We  have
national or international activities coming:  the  Commonwealth  Games,  the
Olympics, and all that. All that means that we need  to  put  in  much  more
effort.

The commission does so by identifying sports on which  to  focus  resources,
developing infrastructure where it is absent, and accelerating the  training
of  coaches  and  managers  to  internationally  acceptable  standards.  The
strategic objectives of  the  commission  are,  therefore,  to  promote  the
advancement of talented athletes by providing access to  scientific  support
training, developing their life-skills  and  ensuring  a  supportive  social
environment for these atheletes.

Lastly, the amendments to the  South  African  Sports  Commission  Act  were
necessitated by a number of factors which were not foreseen at the time  the
Act was originally drafted. These factors have, to some extent, impacted  on
the ability of the commission to fulfil  its  important  obligation  towards
the sporting community of our country. However, some of the amendments  were
also necessary  to  ensure  greater  accountability  of  the  commission  to
Parliament and to the Minister of Sport and  Recreation.  It  is  my  belief
that these amendments will help to improve the  working  of  the  commission
and should therefore be supported by all of us.

In conclusion, as we have our national lottery we hope that when we get  our
slice,  we  will  also  be  able  to  make  some  money  available  for  the
development of sport with the SA Sports Commission. [Applause.]
The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Chairperson,  I  must  thank  the  hon
members for participating in the debate on both these Bills. I  think  I  do
need to say that I take any person I come across as a person  of  integrity.
As the hon member  Kgware  says,  when  we  discussed  these  Bills  in  the
committee, the members there understood  and  accepted  everything  that  we
discussed with them. I will not say much about members who were  not  there,
like Mr Van Niekerk. I have never seen him. I see him ...

 ... vir die eerste keer hier. [... here for the first time.]

I do not think I eagerly anticipate seeing him again, but ...

... daar is 'n verskil tussen mnr Raju en mnr Van Niekerk.  Daardie  verskil
is baie eenvoudig. [... there is a difference between Mr  Raju  and  Mr  Van
Niekerk. The difference is very simple.]

It lies in Mr Raju's understanding of sport  in  the  country  in  terms  of
where it comes from, what it has done over the years, and how the  apartheid
system denigrated people and stripped them of  their  dignity.   He  related
some of those incidents here at the beginning of his  speech.  Mr  Raju  was
there. He knows it. That he is now a member of an organisation  which  is  a
lost cause  is  beyond  my  understanding;  just  beyond  my  understanding.
[Laughter.] That is why I say ...

... daar is 'n verskil en ek verstaan nie hoe mnr Raju ... [... there  is  a
difference and I do not understand how Mr Raju ...]

... can take orders from  people  who  used  to  do  such  things  to  Basil
d'Oliveira and to the golfers that he is talking about. But he still  agrees
with them in what he is saying. [Interjections.]

Ek verstaan dit nie. Dit slaan my dronk. [Gelag.] [I do not  understand  it.
That beats me. [Laughter.]]

But then one has to understand that a piece of bread ...
Just leave it there. [Interjections.] Exactly. [Laughter.]  So  I  am  quite
disappointed, because he understands, he knows people who  put  their  lives
on the line to get South Africa where it is  today.  [Interjections.]  Thank
you. So it is very disturbing.

Now, one of the things that the hon member mentioned was those  issues,  and
we are saying as this present Government that such things will never  happen
again.  Never again will the likes of Basil d'Oliveira  and  youngsters  who
came after Basil be driven out of this country because of the laws  of  this
country. [Interjections.] Never again  will  that  Indian  golfer  take  his
trophy in the rain having beaten Gary Player. He knows him  very  well.  But
he still goes on to say, ``No Government  interference.''  I  will  tell  Mr
Raju good news: We will interfere. We will intervene,  because  we  want  to
change the status quo. We want to change that situation. [Applause.]

He was saying that sportspeople are mature enough. I can tell him  now  that
some of them are not. Some of them are still holding onto  old,  old  views.
It is a pity that this House will not give me a chance to show  hon  members
a  letter  I  received  this  morning.  I  was  reading  it   coming   here.
Interesting, and I did not think I would use it here. [Interjections.]

It is a letter written by a certain Mr  J  Knoesen  -  it  is  an  Afrikaans
surname, Knoesen. The letter was written  to  me  on  14  May  2001  on  the
political interference by the terrorist ANC in rugby. I have not read it,  I
only read the last paragraph, which is shocking:


  We demand that the whites must have their rights and we don't  want  your
  evil so-called ``transformation'' thrust down our throats!

Dit is nou mnr Van Niekerk. [Now that is Mr Van Niekerk.]

Another thing I should mention is that some of these parties, like  the  New
NP and that ``Dom Alliance'' do not take other sports  seriously.  Once  one
touches what they think and perceive to be their sport, rugby, they get  all
fussy.

They do not take other sports seriously. They have this thing that rugby  is
``our sport''. I have got news for the hon Mr Van Niekerk, very  good  news.
We are going to intervene, we are going to make a paradigm shift  in  sport,
we are going to change it. Whether the hon member likes it or  not,  we  are
going to do it.

The hon Mr Van Niekerk may therefore sit here and  talk  about  whatever  he
wants to, but he  is  wasting  his  time.  We  are  the  party  that  is  in
government. We are here to change things that have not been changed in  this
country.

The hon member might just as well keep on prattling  and  talking,  it  will
not help him at all. Government will be involved in sport,  Government  will
change sport, Government will push for paradigm shifts in sport  because  we
do not want the same things to  happen  that  happened  before.  We  do  not
apologise for that, I do not. I have been a sportsperson  for  years.  I  do
not apologise for those things.

I want to sincerely thank the hon members that supported the two  pieces  of
legislation. I thank them very much because they know exactly how  it  feels
to receive one's trophy in the rain. We do not want that to happen again.

In no way are we going to allow a situation where boxing does as  it  likes.
We have the 1954 piece of legislation. The hon member said that a very  good
consultation process took place and that there is  a  large  improvement  in
the new Bill as compared to the old one.  That  improvement,  however,  does
not apply to the member himself. He says there is  too  much  power  in  the
hands of the Minister. Unfortunately I am the  Minister  and  I  will  never
give the power to him. The ``bloedneus'' [bloody nose] [Laughter.]

Dit sal 'n baie, baie koue  dag  wees  as  die  NNP  my  'n  bloedneus  gee.
[Gelag.] [It will be a very, very cold day if the New NP give  me  a  bloody
nose. [Laughter.]]

It will be a very cold day.

The hon member should go home, think about it and know  that  one  does  not
give a rugby forward like me a ``bloedneus'' [bloody nose.] One does not.  I
want to tell the hon Van Niekerk that I have been in the trenches and  I  do
not get a bloody nose very easily. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)
Vote No 18 - Sport and Recreation:

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Chairperson, it is  indeed  an  honour
to address this august House in this, my second budget  speech  as  Minister
of Sport and Recreation. Much has happened over the year  and  it  gives  me
great pleasure to present to the House today our visions and plans  for  the
year that lies ahead.

I remember the enthusiastic contribution of the MEC  responsible  for  sport
in the Northern Cape, Brian Hermanus, to this debate last year,  and  it  is
hard to believe that he is no longer with us. Nor  is  Mr  Elvis  Nkwenyane,
the head of the Mpumalanga department responsible for sport and  recreation.
I wish to take this opportunity to pay  tribute  to  those  two  colleagues,
both of whom died tragically in  the  course  of  performing  their  duties.
While their contributions  to  the  development  of  sport  and  recreation,
especially amongst disadvantaged  communities,  will  be  sorely  missed,  I
believe that the standards that they have set will serve as  an  inspiration
to their successors.
My address here today, as was the case in  the  National  Assembly  not  too
long ago, will relate  primarily  to  sport's  contribution  to  the  policy
thrusts identified  by  the  President  at  the  opening  of  Parliament  in
February of this year,  especially  his  reference  to  building  a  nation,
united in action for change. In this regard I shall be focusing on the  role
of sport and recreation in addressing this objective.

I am sure none of us here today would dispute  the  potential  of  sport  in
nation-building. The fact that  the  rugby  test  on  16  June  between  the
Springboks and the French national team at Ellis Park will  constitute  part
of the Youth Day celebrations is a clear example of the potential role  that
sport can play in promoting change in pursuit of a better South  Africa  for
all. Safa will also host a match in Durban on 17 June as part of  the  Youth
Day celebrations. The players will be visiting Umlazi as part of  the  event
the following day.

I would like to congratulate both Sarfu and Safa on these  initiatives  with
regard to Youth Day. I urge our rugby and soccer-loving  public  to  support
these ventures. I would also like to  urge  the  provincial  departments  to
support the many sports initiatives that will form part  of  the  Youth  Day
celebrations on and around 16 June, if they are not already doing so.

Allow me to say unequivocally that I shall be relentless in the coming  year
in ensuring that sport does serve as a catalyst for change in  our  country.
I shall challenge  any  sports  federation  that  undermines  these  efforts
uncompromisingly.

Hon members will recall that at one stage, sport  was  one  of  the  leading
protagonists for change in this country. We  have  unfortunately  lost  that
advantage and I would like to commit  myself  here  today  to  turning  that
trend around.

During the course of 2000, several major sports federations set targets  for
achieving  representivity  in  their  teams.  I  shall  be  examining  their
performances very shortly. New targets will have to be set  to  ensure  that
we  proceed  progressively  and  rapidly   towards   our   goal   of   total
representivity in line with the demographics of the country.

I am totally committed to this objective. I shall shortly  be  engaging  the
national federations,  big  and  small,  with  a  view  to  measuring  their
performance and extracting from them new commitments for the year  ahead.  I
will request all of them to set new  targets  to  which  I  will  hold  them
accountable, and use any means at my disposal to ensure compliance.

I am aware that, in some instances, especially the smaller federations  have
been getting away with murder. Transformation in sport  involves  more  than
just the attainment of unity. We have now passed that  stage  of  unity.  It
involves  a  paradigm   shift   in   which   nonracialism,   democracy   and
representivity become fundamental principles that inform all  our  practice.
I will no longer tolerate a situation in which  conformity  to  the  minimum
representivity conditions becomes the norm.

Again, I want to reiterate the fact that the practice of replacing  a  black
player in a team by another black player to meet  the  minimum  requirements
cannot continue, as a representative team can comprise more than just  three
black players. That is what most of these  federations  do.  They  have  two
black players in the team. They have one on the bench, and the other  is  on
the field. They then replace that black one with the other  black  one,  and
then  say  they  have  made  their  quota.   That   is   absolute   rubbish.
[Interjections.]

Very often, the national federations blame their provincial  affiliates  for
the lack of representivity at the national  level.  I  am  of  the  opinion,
therefore, that the provincial departments will have to get involved in  the
debate to ensure  that  changes  are  implemented.  I  shall  be  hosting  a
conference on transformation in sport later this year, and  will  spell  out
my intentions in this regard at that forum.
I gave notice of this at the  recent  general  assembly  of  the  SA  Sports
Commission and received large-scale support for  that  initiative.  I  would
like to urge provinces  to  participate  in  that  forum,  and  to  use  the
resolutions that we take there as a  basis  for  tackling  the  problems  in
their back yards.

I want to issue a stern  warning  again  against  the  practice  in  certain
federations - and those federations  know  who  they  are  -  that  use  the
principle of democracy simplistically to exclude blacks  from  positions  in
their  management  structures.  Democracy,  in  the  South  African   sports
context, is more than just a simple numbers game.  It  is  obvious  that  in
terms of membership and numbers of clubs white clubs  will  dominate,  given
our history.

When numbers are used to vote predominantly  white  executive  members  into
power, with a sprinkling of token black faces only in  the  top  structures,
we have lost the spirit, not only of transformation  in  South  Africa,  but
also of reconciliation and nonracism. It is a facade that I  will  challenge
vigorously. I am aware  that  this  problem  may  be  more  extreme  in  the
provinces and will, therefore, elicit your support in rooting out this  evil
at the basic levels.

My  department  will  also  host  a  colloquium  at  the  world   antiracism
conference later this year in Durban, at which the  question  of  racism  in
sport will receive prominence. When one talks about racism in sport, one  is
talking about all kinds of excuses that are made  by  national  federations:
``The player is not ready. He does not know  the  rules.  He  is  still  too
young''. But there is a 19-year-old student who  has  been  taken  into  the
Springbok team. Nobody is saying he is too young. But if  he  were  a  black
player, they would be saying: ``He is not ready  yet.  He  is  too  young.''
[Interjections.]

You people are hopeless. [Interjections.] You should not  even  be  talking,
because you are a disgrace. [Interjections.]

Mr C ACKERMANN: You are talking nonsense.

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Order!  Mr  Van  Niekerk,  order!
[Interjections.] I am sorry, it was actually Mr  Ackermann.   My  apologies.
[Laughter.] It is all  right.  [Interjections.]  Return  to  your  seat,  Mr
Sulliman.

The MINISTER: Chairperson, we are hoping to  involve  some  of  the  world's
leading protagonists of nonracism in sport, and our programme  will  feature
a soccer match between a European under-23 team and a South  African  under-
23 team under the banner ``Red-carding  Racism  in  Sport''.  We  should  do
that: red-card racism in sport. It comes in many forms.

I trust that I will enjoy hon members' support in these endeavours. I  would
like to express my thanks, in anticipation, to  the  KwaZulu-Natal  province
for their promised support in this project, and I urge all  other  provinces
to send delegates to attend this event as well.

Allow me to say in this regard also that the  incident  involving  the  nine
rugby players in the Northern Province does not do  sport  in  general,  and
rugby in particular, any good. I trust that justice will  be  done  in  this
case, and that this sad episode in our country's history  will  inspire  all
of us to rid our society of the scourge of racism.

To that effect we wrote immediately to the Northern Province people  to  say
that they should suspend all nine rugby players. Their club should not  play
rugby in South Africa until the case has been finalised.  They  will  remain
suspended until the case has been finalised.

I have recently appointed a ministerial task team to advise me on  ways  and
means  to  improve  the  performances  of  our   athletes   and   teams   in
international competitions. I am convinced that we can do much better if  we
pool our scarce resources to  prepare  our  athletes  for  participation  in
international competitions. It makes  no  sense  for  me  to  have  separate
structures  preparing  the  same  athletes  that  participate  in  different
international  competitions.  Such  a  practice,  while  being  economically
unsound, also sows confusion amongst our athletes.

We can ill afford the luxury of this level of fragmentation. The  degree  of
consensus that has emerged in  the  preliminary  report  of  the  task  team
against such fragmentation bodes  very  well  for  the  preparation  of  our
sports teams in the future. I look forward to receiving the final report  of
the task team. In this context, I would like to applaud the efforts  of  the
CEO of the SA Sports Commission, Dr Joe Phaahla, who is here with  us  today
- he is sitting over there - and the members  of  the  task  team,  for  the
sterling work that they are doing.

Dr Phaahla will be visiting all the provinces during the month  of  June  to
inform all the stakeholders of the progress of that  ministerial  task  team
to date, and to solicit their inputs on the matter.

The initial reflections of the task team on how to divide  the  scarce  pool
of resources available for sport and recreation are  encouraging  indeed.  I
can only concur that Government and the private sector  will  have  to  work
together if we are going to make any headway in international sport.

I would like to express my concern  about  the  slow  rate  of  progress  in
promoting a more equitable dispensation for women in sport in  our  country.
Despite various efforts, we have  not  had  the  rate  of  success  that  we
envisaged in addressing this very urgent matter. For  me,  changes  in  this
crucial sphere must be prioritised, and I shall  be  focusing  attention  on
the matter during this year. Again, provinces have a critical role to  play.
I am aware of women-in-sport initiatives that are still  surviving  in  some
of the provinces. I would like to encourage all  provinces  to  address  the
matter, which has to be tackled at the grass-roots level.

I am of the opinion that the Department of Sport  and  Recreation  has  been
extremely fortunate over the year to the extent that we have  been  provided
with a resource that we could only have dreamt of before.  The  access  that
we have been afforded to poverty relief,  infrastructure  creation  and  job
creation funds has positioned us amongst major role-players  in  the  public
sector to tackle the crucial issue of poverty.

In our quest to access these resources, we have argued that the building  of
sports  and  recreation  facilities   in   disadvantaged   communities   can
contribute to temporary and permanent job creation, income  generation  and,
hence, poverty relief. We are committed to making a success of this  project
over the next three years with a view to securing these  funds  as  part  of
our baseline budget beyond 2004 to facilitate delivery in an area  in  which
there is also  a  huge  backlog  in  our  country.  We  shall  therefore  be
contributing to the resolution of the  twin  problems  of  poverty  and  the
shortage of sports facilities in disadvantaged communities.

We have been granted R40 million in the  first  year  of  the  project,  R96
million in the second year and R129 million in the third year,  provided  we
are successful in each of the three years. I am very committed  to  ensuring
that we are successful. Of course, facility creation is a  function  of  the
provincial and local tiers of government.

We have merely secured the funds from  the  National  Treasury  and  we  are
dependent on members to deliver the facilities  and  to  maintain  them.  We
have therefore tried to cement a  tripartite  bond  between  my  department,
Sport and  Recreation  South  Africa,  the  SA  Sports  Commission  and  the
provincial departments responsible for sport and recreation.

I am of the opinion that co-operation between these structures will  provide
the best potential for success  in  this  project.  I  therefore  appeal  to
members to ensure that this project succeeds. If anything,  it  is  the  one
area in which the NCOP must play a significant role to  ensure  success.  We
have worked hard to secure these resources, and cannot  permit  it  to  slip
through our fingers by not delivering on our objectives.

Last year, I spoke about my intention to bring  sport  and  recreation  into
the mainstream of Government efforts aimed at  working  for  change  in  the
country. I believe that our Building for Sport  and  Recreation  project  is
aimed at doing  exactly  that  in  the  context  of  our  stated  intentions
regarding integrated planning and delivery.

Ours  will  be  a  concerted  effort,  along  with  those  of   our   sister
departments,  to  prioritise  the  poor  and  the  disadvantaged,   and   to
contribute to rural development and urban renewal. We shall be building  and
upgrading sport and recreation facilities in each  of  the  provinces  using
labour-intensive methods in which we will engage local communities.

In the first year of the project, we shall have reached 33% of  the  poverty
nodes identified for urgent intervention by our President, and have  covered
all 100% over the ensuing two years. I would like to urge  members  of  this
House to become involved  in  these  projects  in  their  constituencies  to
ensure that our  investments  are  sound,  and  that  the  communities  and,
especially the rural women involved do, indeed, benefit.

I want to mention here that we have said we should cut down as  much  as  we
can on  consultants.  People  in  the  areas  should  be  the  ones  who  do
consultancy for this type of project. [Applause.]

Moreover, our people must  take  ownership  of  these  facilities  to  guard
against  their  being  vandalised.  We  are  also  planning  to  have  these
facilities  appropriately  named  after  veterans  of   the   anti-apartheid
struggle as sport's contribution to symbolic reparation  for  the  suffering
of our people under apartheid. Certainly  we  cannot  name  them  after  Abe
Williams, neither can we name them after Gerald Morkel. We  will  name  them
after anti-apartheid veterans, and not just any veterans. The  director  for
this project is sitting with us. He is a new director,  Mr  Solomon  Phango,
who will be leading this project with the provinces.

In his response to the  debate  on  his  state  of-the-nation  address,  the
President mandated the departments responsible  for  sport  and  recreation,
education and arts and culture, and the National Youth Commission to  design
programmes that would engage the youth  constructively.  We  have  risen  to
that challenge and, as Sport and Recreation South Africa, we have  developed
a comprehensive programme that  should  provide  many  opportunities  on  an
ongoing basis for participation in constructive activities.

We shall be involved, side by side with the National  Youth  Commission,  as
part of this initiative in celebrating the 25th anniversary  of  the  Soweto
uprising, with a substantial sports programme that, as I intimated  earlier,
will culminate in the rugby test between between South Africa and France  on
16 June at Ellis Park.

In  our  broader  programme  we  have  engaged  the  United   School   Sport
Association of South Africa. We have ensured, through this initiative,  that
we also address the problems of  HIV/Aids  through  their  love-life  games.
This programme will be implemented throughout the  country,  at  the  local,
regional, provincial and national levels.

Again, this is one area in which co-operation between  the  three  tiers  of
Government is vitally important for success. I am very happy to report  that
there  is  close  co-operation  between  my  department  and   the   Gauteng
department responsible for sport and recreation. I would like to urge  other
provinces to encourage similar levels of co-operation.

In the latter regard, members would agree with  me  that  the  school  sport
issue has remained unresolved for too long. My  colleague  the  Minister  of
Education and I have come  to  an  agreement  that  we  shall  assume  joint
responsibility for school sport and physical education.

The Department of Education will assume responsibility  for  the  curricular
aspects of physical education and school sport, including interschool  sport
at the local and, maybe, at the regional level, while Sport  and  Recreation
South Africa will assume responsibility for representative school  sport  at
the provincial, national and international levels.
Of course, provincial departments will have  to  assume  responsibility  for
the participation of their representative teams up to national level,  while
we  and  the  SA  Sports  Commission  will  have  to  play  a  role  at  the
international level.

We are still  grappling  with  the  problem  of  resourcing  this  important
venture. We will  have  to  be  innovative  in  finding  solutions  to  this
problem. I intend calling the national school sports indaba later this  year
in which all stakeholders will have the opportunity to deliberate on  a  way
forward.

I therefore call on the provinces, Ussasa, teacher unions, sports coaches  -
and when I say sports coaches,  I  also  include  sports  coaches  from  the
former Model C schools, because they have  a  tendency  to  keep  away  from
these things - Sassu and even parents to assist me in making this  indaba  a
success, and to participate in it vigorously.

The past few months have been historic for  the  sports  movement.  We  have
witnessed the dissolution of the National Sports  Council  and  the  handing
over of the baton which they  carried  so  successfully,  along  with  their
predecessors, Sacos, the pioneers of  nonracial  sport,  to  the  SA  Sports
Commission.

This also implied the end of the road for the provincial affiliates  of  the
NSC. This event certainly marked the end of an era in our sports history.

We need to pay homage to all those stalwarts, both in  Sacos  and  NSC,  who
sacrificed so much to ensure that nonracial sport  prevailed,  and  that  it
made the contribution that it did to the liberation of our people  from  the
shackles of apartheid.

The dissolution of the NSC poses interesting challenges  for  the  provinces
in terms of establishing civil society structures to replace the  provincial
NSCs. I am aware of  the  efforts  in  some  provinces  to  establish  sport
councils. This might be a possible option. I will engage with  the  MECs  in
Minmec on 25 June to try to find a common solution to the matter.

The meeting earlier  this  month  of  the  SA  Sports  Commission's  general
assembly represented another significant milestone in our sporting  history.
Judging from the turnout and lively debate at that  forum,  I  am  convinced
that we have a winning formula that will ensure that every  sportsperson  in
our country has access to a structure through  which  to  make  his  or  her
voice heard. Moreover, the general assembly will serve as  a  watchdog  that
will ensure that the SA Sports Commission delivers on its mandate.

We  successfully  launched  the  South  African  Indigenous   Games   at   a
captivating event at a most appropriate venue, the Basotho Cultural  Village
in Qwaqwa in the Free  State  earlier  this  year,  fulfilling  a  long-held
desire  for  the  President  to  see  these  activities  that  were   facing
extinction being revived. The indigenous games  do  not  only  involve  more
South Africans in wholesome physical  activity,  but  also  ensure  that  we
preserve a very important part of our culture. The  Eastern  Cape  has  just
launched its own chapter of the  indigenous  games,  and  I  would  like  to
encourage all other provinces that have not yet done so to follow suit.

Our athletes have started their preparations for the Commonwealth  Games  in
Manchester next year. Provincial academies and  sports  institutes  have  an
important role to play in this project. We  urge  members  to  provide  them
with encouragement.

We are also looking at the South African  Games,  a  competition  that  will
slot into the four-year development cycle which culminates  in  the  Olympic
Games. This correlates well with the proposals of the ministerial task  team
for a developmental approach to international participation.

We have also witnessed  the  establishment  of  a  distribution  agency  for
allocating funds that have accrued from the  National  Lottery,  which  Tata
Kgware spoke about, to nongovernmental agencies in sport and  recreation.  I
would like to urge sports structures at all levels to access those funds  to
promote activities, especially in the disadvantaged areas.
The distribution agency has put out a call for all proposals for  the  first
allocation  that  has  become  available  now,  and  has  focused   on   the
development of facilities, the supply of sports equipment and  kit  for  all
sporting  codes,  schools  and  any  organisations  that  apply,  and  human
resource development as priorities during the first round.

Applications closed on 31 May, but a further call will be put  out  as  more
funds become available. I am sure we will be able to talk  to  the  Minister
of Trade and Industry for those sports that have applied late, so that  they
can be considered, because we know that some of  our  sports  structures  do
not have the capacity to write all  these  business  plans.  The  SA  Sports
Commission is there to assist them with precisely that.

In the years 2000 and 2001, the highlight  was  most  certainly  the  Sydney
Olympic and  Paralympic  Games,  in  which  our  teams  competed.  Both  the
Paralympic and Olympic teams did us very proud.  The  Paralympic  team  must
really be mentioned because they brought home a lot of gold medals.
Our cricketers continue to enjoy success as well. They have come  back  from
the West Indies. They have done very well. Let us leave out the dagga  saga.
A former DP veteran thinks that is a cool thing  to  do.  Please,  it  is  a
shame and a scandal. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Calm down!

The MINISTER: Please  talk  to  her.  If  one  has  children  and  lives  in
Manenberg, Mitchells Plain or another of the areas where we live,  one  will
see that drugs are a problem. And then there is someone who then  says  that
we should. Oh, let me rather not say anything.

The Sharks have made it to the finals of the Super 12 series. They  lost  to
the Brumbies, but they did  very  well.  I  must  also  congratulate  Rudolf
Straeuli, the Sharks coach, on going beyond the norm and letting  all  those
black players play all the time. They are Etienne  Fynn,  Ricardo  Loubscher
and Deon Kayser. They were stars, and it  clearly  shows  that  if  one  has
black players in one's side, that side will go to the final. [Laughter.]  In
the latter regard, we want to congratulate  the  Sharks  and  the  provinces
that make up the Sharks.

Bafana Bafana must be congratulated as well for  their  performances  during
the past year. They have done very well. They  did  us  proud  in  the  last
game. Allow me also to congratulate the Buccaneers on their success in  what
must surely have been one of the most closely contested  and  most  exciting
league competitions of the  PSL  in  years.  Amabagabaga,  Orlando  Pirates!
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! My interruption of the hon the  Minister
does not in any way express my views on Orlando Pirates. [Laughter.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon colleagues, hon  MECs,  it  is
indeed an honour to  congratulate  and  commend  Minister  Balfour  and  his
department for  reaffirming  their  commitment  to  the  millions  of  South
Africans who have, through their unrelenting endeavours,  gained  access  to
the playing fields. However, as we all know, the playing  fields  are  still
not as level as we would like them to be.

Over the last few years we have witnessed the emergence of various  athletes
and administrators, excelling either at provincial  or  at  national  level.
The hon the Minister mentioned  these  and  other  achievements  during  the
debate on his Budget Vote in the National Assembly. The efforts and  strides
these individuals have taken are, indeed,  enormous,  considering  where  we
have come from and what we had to endure to get to  where  we  are  at  this
juncture in our sporting history. It should therefore not  surprise  anybody
if we jealously guard and protect these achievements with all the vigour  we
can muster.

We have, in recent weeks, read in the media about the directives  issued  by
the United Cricket Board of South Africa  to  its  unions  to  increase  the
total of black players in  their  teams  while  they  are  actually  on  the
playing field. We welcome this, because the practice of replacing one  black
player  with  another,  week  after  week,  as  the  Minister  has   already
mentioned, does  not  benefit  the  player,  and  neither  does  it  advance
transformation and development.

We also welcome the decision by Sarfu to appoint only domestic  coaches  for
our teams in the Vodacom Super 12 rugby competition next  year.  We  welcome
this, since we saw, in the  last  Super  12  competition,  the  disdain  and
contempt with which foreign coaches treated our own players.  We  have  also
put programmes  in  place  to  ensure  that  we  fast-track  representivity,
especially in our national teams.

As a consequence of this, the question that immediately springs to  my  mind
is whether the federations are, in fact,  committed  to  the  principles  of
transformation. The lack of transformation by some federations is  certainly
very disconcerting. Too many of our federations are  still  pale  and  male,
and are stubbornly refusing to become part of the  democratic  culture  that
has taken root in the majority of federations.

I would therefore like to call upon the various provincial  departments,  in
support of the Minister, to start playing a bigger role  in  monitoring  the
progress, or lack of it, in the federations. It is  our  responsibility,  as
public representatives and members also representing our provinces, to  take
a keen interest in sporting  matters.  They  need  to  start  programmes  to
ensure that these federations are monitored and audits  are  done,  so  that
this can convincingly become a democratic reality. The national body  should
not always be the yardstick by which transformation is measured.

The most common complaint by  federations  is  about  lack  of  finance.  We
believe that federations should be more self-reliant, and not just  rely  on
the Government as their main and only source of revenue. They should  become
more innovative. They should also explore the forging of ties  with  similar
sports federations around the world, as we are living in a global village.

The Department of Sport and Recreation should also ensure  that  the  budget
allocated  to  federations  is  indeed  spent  frugally.  If  this  is   not
happening, we strongly urge the department to withhold such  funding.  Also,
each of the nine provincial  sporting  departments  should  have  a  funding
policy for its federation in  place,  underpinned  by  strict  criteria.  It
should also play a crucial role in the recreational life of its  communities
and especially its youth.

A glaring example of the lack of such a programme is  here  in  the  Western
Cape. Since October last year, the devastating effects of murders  by  gangs
of youths on the Cape Flats have been brought to bear  on  its  communities.
This clearly points to a lack of vision  and  political  will  to  make  the
resources for sport and recreation available to these  ravaged  communities.
But enough said about the Western Cape.

We also believe that the local  government  must  have  a  budget  for  this
purpose and that, in addition to the provision of basic  sports  facilities,
they  must  also  involve  sports   councils   and   other   community-based
organisations in the implementation and the  sustainability  of  the  grass-
roots development programmes. We also call on the Department  of  Sport  and
Recreation to consider for financial assistance only those federations  that
have demonstrated a willingness to democratise.

More school sports need to be prioritised  with  sufficient  budgets.  Small
sporting codes, or Cinderella sports, as they are better known, should  also
be provided with the space and time to develop.  We  further  maintain  that
federations should also, as far as possible, endeavour to  raise  their  own
funds.

We also saw the launching and  the  passing  of  the  South  African  Sports
Commission Act. This Act provides for the  establishment  of  the  statutory
body   responsible   for   the   co-ordination,   promotion,    development,
administration and resourcing of sport and  recreation.  The  need  for  the
SASC arouse  out  of  the  absence  of  a  streamlined  mechanism  with  the
responsibility for delivery  and  the  capability  of  procuring  additional
resources for sport in addition to the Government allocation.
One of the main aims of the SASC is to provide for  an  integrated  and  co-
ordinated approach to sport promotion and provision, and also to ensure  the
continued delivery of the sports programmes of the NSC,  which  we  know  we
are actually doing away with. The Department of Sport and Recreation is,  at
the same time, introducing new services  in  line  with  the  needs  of  the
times. The SASC certainly  faces  enormous  tasks,  and  it  will  need  our
support.

The decision to have a smaller Department of Sport and Recreation  alongside
the SASC meant that there had to be a distinction between the roles and  the
definitions of the two structures.

The second challenge facing the SASC is the lack  of  resources.  While  the
SASC  can  raise  funds  from  the  private  sector,  it  becomes  extremely
difficult unless one represents  the  Olympic  team  or  rugby,  soccer  and
cricket. Sport that does not enjoy prime time television  viewing,  such  as
hockey, netball, etc, finds it difficult to attract sponsors. Despite  these
and other  challenges  the  commission  has  faced,  and  will  still  face,
significant progress has been made in establishing the machinery  for  sport
development in our country. With these few words, I  want  to  say  that  we
support the Vote.

Mrs N M MADLALA (Gauteng): Chairperson, permanent members  of  the  National
Council of Provinces and delegates, at the  outset,  I  wish  to  record  my
sincere appreciation to the  Minister,  Comrade  Ngconde  Balfour,  for  his
efforts towards ensuring good governance in sport and recreation.  Sport  is
a very emotive issue. Sport is reflective of the moods  of  society,  it  is
reflective  of  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  a  country  and  it   is
reflective of the  unity  that  prevails  in  the  country.  It  is  also  a
barometer and an indicator of change. Sport indeed is a  universal  language
and, through South  Africa's  readmittance  to  the  international  sporting
arena, now projects the full image of South Africa to the world.

Noting the above, we realise the importance of Government's role  to  ensure
that sport  in  the  country  reflects  growth,  unity  and  representivity.
Government is the enabler of the sports movement, and must ensure  the  full
accountability of  sport  to  its  members,  civil  society  and  all  other
stakeholders. The framework for the governance of sports in the  country  is
governed by the Constitution, which positions sport and  recreation  matters
as  an  exclusive  provincial  legislative  competence,  articulated   under
Schedule 5. The enactment of the SA Sports Commission,  via  the  SASC  Act,
further provides for sport to be co-ordinated and promoted in  the  national
context.

The SA Sports Commission is therefore charged  with  the  responsibility  of
fast-tracking the  development  of  sport.  This  is  achieved  through  the
effective  collaboration  between  the  SA  Sports  Commission,   provincial
departments of sport and recreation and the various  sport  federations  and
recreational providers. Local  government  provides  added  support  to  the
consolidation and growth of sport at all levels. This  framework  for  sport
delivery also takes cognisance of the autonomy  of  the  federations  within
the global perspective, whilst being totally  transparent,  accountable  and
governed by its respective constitutions, giving due regard to the  dictates
of the supreme law of the country.

Understanding the above, the barometer at our disposal  reflects  a  picture
that says all is not well in sport and recreation. Sport  does  not  reflect
the demographics of our country, nor the provincial make-up of  the  various
provinces. Racism, as has been noted, is still rife in sport  and  the  pace
of affirmative action is quite slow. The skewed resourcing  of  sport  is  a
legacy of the past that was so entrenched, and serves as  a  major  obstacle
to  change.  The  lack  of  will  to  fast-track  change,  on  the  part  of
federations, coupled with a  lack  of  resources,  makes  transformation  in
sport a challenge for Government in all spheres, the private sector and  all
of civil society.

We are a long way from gender equality  in  sport.  Whilst  all  sectors  of
society have called loudly and clearly for the gender gap to be closed  with
immediate haste, there is still a noticeable dragging of feet.  Once  again,
the need for a  consolidated  approach  is  required.  In  the  province  of
Gauteng, at a summit held with all stakeholders, it was resolved that  women
representation in key positions  should  constitute  at  least  30%  of  the
leadership corps by the end of 2001. As  Government,  we  must  monitor  the
situation and ensure that federations do not renege on these decisions.

Our colonial past promoted colonial sport and games at the  expense  of  our
rich  heritage  of  indigenous  sport  and  games.  We  have  a   collective
responsibility to address this legacy.

In this regard we wish to commend the Minister and the SA Sports  Commission
for the successful launch of indigenous sport and games.  The  launch  alone
will, however, not guarantee the  future  development  and  growth  in  this
area. Greater resources and commitment are required if  we  are  to  project
this rich heritage on the global stage. This will be  our  contribution,  as
the custodians  of  sport,  to  the  preservation  and  celebration  of  our
heritage.

The youth of this country should parade the  global  village  as  proud  and
confident ambassadors. They should be able to develop  as  complete  persons
with knowledge and skills. The nursery of this development lies  within  our
schools. School sport is therefore a vital cog for the  achievement  of  the
above. Here we need to acknowledge the  role  of  the  United  School  Sport
Association of South Africa and its army of volunteers. These  are  soldiers
who march on in the face of extreme difficulties.

The  various  provincial  departments  of  sport  and  recreation,  and  the
Department of Education, should join  forces  to  put  in  place  meaningful
programmes that will afford all children the opportunity  to  realise  their
goals and dreams. Federations have a responsibility to join forces  so  that
the teachers and volunteers are continuously armed with relevant and  up-to-
date training and coaching techniques.

Sport and recreation should be governed in an open and  democratic  fashion.
Civil society  and,  in  particular,  directly  interested  parties,  should
develop its policies and principles. Government  should  ensure  that  these
policies are consistent with the laws of the country, as well as see to  the
enforcement of these laws.

Provincial  plans  for  sport  must  take  into   account   the   challenges
articulated above. Legislation at  this  level  of  government  should  give
credence to  the  Constitution  of  the  country  and  promote  co-operative
governance in sport and recreation  development.  Representative  sport  and
recreation authorities should be constituted so that the voice of the  sport
and recreation family is formally articulated to provincial government.

The sport and recreation authorities should be democratic bodies  that  will
interface directly with the responsible member of the executive  council  in
the province. These authorities should be  able  to  consolidate  sport  and
recreation development and advise the MEC in that  province  on  policy  and
related matters.

The functions and powers of such authorities should  facilitate  a  credible
voice  for  sport  and  recreation  in  the  province,  based   on   regular
communication and interaction within this environment.  All  efforts  should
be synergistic in nature in order to  complement  meaningful  transformation
and growth.

Provincial government must take up the constitutional challenge  to  provide
for  sport  and  recreation  in  a  manner   that   ensures   accessibility,
accountability and meaningful redress in the areas  of  affirmation  of  the
previously disadvantaged and marginalised; in the  areas  that  promote  the
inclusion of persons with disabilities in mainstream sport; in the areas  of
the sport and recreation leadership echelon; and in the areas of  provincial
and national honours. Greater resources must be made  available  for  skills
development programmes, equipment and facilities for  sport  and  recreation
to propel the rate of accessibility as mentioned.

In conclusion, I would like to thank the Minister for  his  efforts  towards
the development of a master plan. We are confident that  the  issues  raised
will be featured in this blueprint for sport and  recreation.  We  must  all
take note of the vital role that sport can play towards the development  and
growth of our nation. Let us give sport a chance. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, hon Minister, special  delegates  and  colleagues,
the creation of a separate Ministry to take charge of sport  and  recreation
in South Africa is a clear indication of  the  Government's  seriousness  in
acknowledging that South African sportsmen and women form an  integral  part
of the reconstruction of our society and nation-building.

Since ancient times, the Greeks have played a significant  role  in  putting
sport to work for national pride. The Greeks  gave  us  the  Olympic  Games,
which have endured till the present time.

Today, South Africa stands on the threshold  of  great  and  exciting  times
ahead in the international arena. In games such as soccer, cricket,  tennis,
swimming, athletics and golf we are world-class. In  the  lesser  codes,  we
are getting there.
The hon the Minister has been more eloquent in paying  tribute  to  some  of
our  star  individuals  and  teams  that  have  brought   us   international
recognition and pride. We  join  him  today  in  saluting  those  victorious
ambassadors of our country.

But the advent of  professionalism  has  marred  the  physiognomy  of  South
African sport - not only South African sport,  but  international  sport  as
well. The lure of the dollar has contaminated every sporting code  in  every
form, be it aspects of administration, the form of  the  government  entity,
the sportspersons themselves or the sponsors.  Many  negatives  have  spread
like  tentacles   of   a   poisonous   nettle,   affecting   the   wholesome
administration and performances that the original founding  fathers  of  the
Olympic Games had imagined and anticipated.

I shall refrain from dwelling on some of these insidious aspects  of  sport.
I am not going to talk about the aura of impurity  that  surrounds  so  many
codes of sport, both nationally and internationally.
If our Government is serious about  putting  South  Africa  on  the  map  of
international  sport,  then   we   must   ensure   that   our   high-profile
administrators come  up  with  the  goods.  My  colleague  in  the  National
Assembly, Mr Donald Lee, raised concerns about missing moneys or moneys  not
accounted for in certain codes. I am sure that the Minister is aware of  the
different instances of such misdemeanours.  However,  this  is  an  area  of
serious concern.

Maladministration and improper bookkeeping and  accountability,  à  la  Alan
Boesak, must never characterise the way the Sport and Recreation  budget  is
administered in  this  country.  We  cannot  allow  a  situation  where  the
Minister's good intentions and  the  Ministry's  priorities  for  sport  and
recreation are sabotaged by administrators and  individuals  who  evince  an
inflated sense of their own importance and, instead  of  being  instrumental
in ensuring that sponsorship moneys and other  resources  intended  for  the
sportsmen, women and teams representing the country are properly  disbursed,
end up instead with those moneys in personal bank accounts.
In short, these misguided administrators put themselves above the teams  and
individuals that they are supposed to be taking care of. Such  reprehensible
acts by administrators, managers and coaches  are  tantamount  to  sabotage.
The sports Ministry  itself  must  carry  the  responsibility  of  carefully
identifying personnel and selecting those individuals  for  important  high-
profile appointments. Obviously, individuals with  the  penchant  for  self-
enrichment must be declared nonstarters.

The hon Minister Balfour's intentions have  been  made  clear.  One  has  to
recognise the importance of the recently held conference  on  antidoping  in
sport, for instance. He is someone who means business. We  applaud  the  hon
the Minister on the initiative taken and the proactive stance  that  he  has
adopted in this regard.

There is no  doubt  that  this  hon  Minister,  thanks  to  his  charismatic
profile, has raised the consciousness of sport in this  country  across  the
political spectrum in the minds of all South Africans. We recognise and  pay
tribute to his serious attitude adopted in this regard.

Sport and recreation are building blocks in building a nation, and  we  must
pause here and reflect on the profound weight of this  statement.  My  party
has no problem with such a noble vision and  mission  for  the  Ministry  of
Sport and Recreation. Sport is not for recreation  and  entertainment  only;
building a united nation is an absolute imperative.

However, if equity is  to  be  established  and  restored,  then  access  to
facilities by mostly the hitherto marginalised and impoverished sector  must
be considered a prerequisite, a sine qua non, in  realising  the  goals  set
out by the Ministry of Sport and Recreation. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr L S GABELA (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon Minister, MECs  and  members
present ...

... mangiqale ngokuzwakalisa okukhulu ukubonga kuNgqongqoshe ekutheni  nathi
baKwaZulu-Natali  asincome  ngomsebenzi  owenziwayo  esifundazweni  sakithi.
Nakuba kunjalo, ngifuna ukusho futhi  ukuthi  mningi  umsebenzi  okusafanele
wenziwe ngoba yize noma kukhona leyo mithonseyana yokuhle okwenzekayo  kepha
izinto kazihambi kahlehle.

Kwi-portfolio ye-education  and  culture  yesishayamthetho  saKwaZulu-Natali
sesike sakhuluma kabanzi ngodaba lokuthi, emkhakheni wezemidlalo, enye  into
esilimazayo ukuthi lo  Mnyango  usuke  ungene  ngaphansi  komkhakha  ophethe

uye athole ukuthi lo msebenzi ugcina usuphathwa ngendlela  yokuthi  ezingeni
eliphezulu kube  yizinga  likamqondisi  nje  kuphela.  Lokho  kudala  ukuthi
umsebenzi uphazamiseke. Engingakusho  nje  ukuthi  enye  into  esikhathazayo
ukuthi kwayena mqondisi ndini lowo  kumanje  nje  waze  wamiswa  emsebenzini
ngezinsolo zokukhwabanisa.

Ikhona-ke imizamo eyenziwayo  futhi  miningi.  Kepha-ke  umkhankaso  wokuthi
kube khona ushintsho ngokuphelele, njengalokhu sisebenza  ngaphansi  kwesimo

kunenhloso yokuzama ukuthi ibe khona impumelelo.

Ezemidlalo  ziyenzeka   ezikoleni   kodwa   inkinga   ekhona   ukuthi   labo

Natali. Isifundazwe saKwaZulu-Natali siyinkinga nje eyaziwayo  kwezemidlalo.
(Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[... I would like to begin by thanking the Minister  for  congratulating  us
in KwaZulu-Natal on the work we have done in our  province.  However,  there
is still a lot of work to be done because even though there  are  some  good
things, the situation is still not right.

In the ministry of education and culture of the province, we mentioned  that
sports matters  are  crippled  by  the  fact  that  sports  fall  under  the
department of education, culture and nature  conservation,  etc.  One  finds
that this task is performed only at director-general  level.  This  disturbs
the work. Another thing that worries us is that  even  the  director-general
was stopped, because he was linked to misappropriation.

However, many attempts are being made, although there has not  been  a  full
campaign since we started working under new conditions. We are still in  the
middle of the work since in the plans for sports we have a  department  that
focuses on sports in schools as well as a department that focuses on  sports
outside schools. All this is an attempt to bring about success.

Sports are being performed in schools, but the problem  is  that  those  who
succeed, those who climb the ladder of success and who end up in  big  teams
in the province, which could be rugby or cricket,  usually  are  the  people
from Model C schools. There are no players  who  are  the  product  of  poor
people. This means that there is still a lot of work to be done.

We are going to need the Minister's assistance in helping  the  province  on
how best to manage the area of sports and in  investing  in  the  skills  of
young people and developing a followable plan to  ensure  that  these  young
people become achievers in sports in KwaZulu-Natal. The province of KwaZulu-
Natal is clearly a problematic province when it comes to sports.]

If I could just make a reference to soccer, each time the  season  comes  to
an end we know that there is a team from KwaZulu-Natal that will not  be  in
the PSL for the next season, which is a serious problem for the province.

KwaZulu-Natal has legends: The caretaker coach  of  Mamelodi  Sundowns,  the
Mkheleles, the Sizwe Motaungs, the Junior Njiyelas, the Prof Ngubanes -  one
of the respected administrators in South Africa, now with Manning Rangers  -
Penny Heyns, and many others. The problem is that for most of our people  to
succeed they have to leave the province. It is a problem for us. I think  we
do need some assistance. We have legends like Roger Sedwick,  for  instance.
We have him there, but we do have problems. This means that we require  much
assistance. Well, of course, there is a greater challenge  on  the  part  of
Government to play a role in seeing to it that the problems that we face  as
a province, as a whole, are addressed.

Let me also raise an issue about the Cricket World Cup  that  is  coming  to
South Africa. I would like  to  say  to  the  Minister  that  we  share  the
concerns. I know the Minister is working very hard. Some of the  people  who
are with us in the movement are part of the committee he  met  yesterday.  I
have been briefed on the deliberations of  that  meeting.  Let  us  indicate
that while we may be angry with the United Cricket Board of SA, we will  not
support a situation in which people go out and lobby India not  to  come  to
participate. We do not support that.

We have a problem in KwaZulu-Natal concerning the Chatsworth  grounds.  They
are the only cricket grounds in an area  of  the  previously  disadvantaged.
There is none other. When we were ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr H T SOGONI: Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  MECs,  special  delegates,
officials of the department and members, I support and  welcome  the  Budget
Vote as presented by the hon the Minister to the House this morning. I  also
take this opportunity to debate the subject of sport in  the  new  political
dispensation and atmosphere sport played  a  significant  role  in  bringing
about. Boycotts and campaigns to discredit sport in the  country  were  some
of the peaceful means that sent a clear message  to  our  fellow  countrymen
and to the world that all was not well.

In terms of the South African Sports Commission Act of 1998, the  department
shares  responsibilities  with  the  SA  Sports  Commission.  The  extensive
briefing of the Select Committee on Education and  Recreation  by  both  the
department and the  commission  has  assisted  in  giving  clarity,  and  in
providing explanations and additional information on the roles  of  the  two
bodies.

It is important to note that in the briefing to  the  select  committee  the
commission acknowledged its major obstacle -  the  inadequate  resources  it
has inherited. The commission is equally  conscious  of  another  challenge:
the  difficulty  of  securing  sponsorships  from  the  private  sector   or
persuading businesses to put funds where they are most needed.

I raise this because we should accept that the question of funding of  sport
in South Africa, in order  to  transform  it  in  such  a  manner  that  all
provinces and all  sections  of  our  community  benefit  equally,  is  very
critical to the department and the  commission.  This  is  particularly  the
case because sport impacts hugely on the development of the country.

South Africa's image as a world-class  competitor  continues  to  grow.  The
status  of  individual  sportspeople  has,  equally,  improved.  Outstanding
performers have achieved international recognition  and  made  South  Africa
proud. The lifestyle of successful men and women in  sport  is  dramatically
changing, because sport is becoming an occupation,  a  career,  that  should
adequately  address   issues   of   unemployment,   poverty   and   economic
development, one of the main objectives that the department pursues.

To achieve success in  these  endeavours,  therefore,  the  significance  of
public-private  partnerships  in  the   promotion   of   sport   cannot   be
overemphasised. After all, both  parties  benefit  equally  from  the  joint
venture. This is the route  that  most,  if  not  all,  successful  sporting
countries in the world follow.
I am also appreciative of the process  of  streamlining  the  department  by
phasing out the regional structures in our province, the Eastern  Cape,  and
decentralising services to the districts where the clients are.  This  is  a
positive step because it brings the activities of the department  closer  to
the people. The process, however, is raising  concerns  among  some  of  the
department's officers. They fear that the downgrading of the  department  is
a threat to their jobs. Perhaps the Minister may give some light on  whether
there is any justification for such fears.

To  conclude,  adequate  distribution  of   resources   and   provision   of
infrastructure in the rural areas remains the greatest challenge. There  are
sports that were previously dominant in  white  areas,  whose  equipment  is
also unaffordable. The situation, in my view, still leaves the  only  option
to open black communities to develop and refine only what they have and  can
afford, while remaining deprived of  the  opportunities  to  participate  in
other sports of their choice and ability. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
Ms H H MALGAS (Eastern Cape): Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members  of
the NCOP, comrades, ladies and gentlemen, it  gives  me  great  pleasure  to
speak on the policy debate on Budget Vote No 18 on Sport and  Recreation  of
the hon the Minister, Comrade  N Balfour,  on  behalf  of  the  MEC  Miss  M
Bhalindlela of the Eastern Cape.

In the Eastern Cape we have just emerged from  a  year  that  provided  many
challenges and successes. The year ahead poses its  own  set  of  challenges
and opportunities. Each year we try to achieve a little more to  improve  on
how we do things, and to reach more communities in  our  province.  That  is
how  we  see  improving  service  delivery.  As  our  Government  grows  and
develops, we cannot rest on the laurels of past successes. We need  to  seek
out new challenges of delivering more services, and  to  do  so  better,  to
more people and more places.

The Department of Sport and Recreation is more than ready  to  take  up  the
challenges posed. Our department has embraced  a  vision  of  a  united  and
peaceful  Eastern  Cape  where  the  spiritual,  intellectual  and  material
upliftment of the people are fully realised through sport and recreation.

The budget allocated to the department as a whole is R176,794  million,  and
that represents the largest amount so far given to the  department.  I  know
that the Minister knows that when it comes to the department of the  Eastern
Cape, we will have arts and culture, too, in that budget.

Looking at the challenges and opportunities for 2001-02, the  biggest  issue
facing the department is utilising  their  line  functions  to  address  the
problem of poverty and its manifestations in our province. ``A  better  life
for all,'' is no longer a slogan, but a cornerstone of the policies  of  the
department. The issue confronting all our managers is how they  manage  this
budget in their respective line functions.

When it comes to the challenge facing us, to begin  with  we  are  targeting
service delivery and accountability. These need to be achieved  efficiently,
effectively and economically, as required by the Public  Finance  Management
Act and the White Paper on the Transformation of the Public Service.

Our next challenge is restructuring. The executive council of  our  province
has identified the need for service delivery through  the  restructuring  of
the social needs department, with social welfare, education,  health,  sport
and arts and culture combined in the same cluster.

This is in alignment with the new municipal demarcation. The  new  structure
has 24 districts. We have allocated R37,8 million for the running  of  sport
and recreation within the districts. We have decreased  the  budget  of  the
previous year by R28,65 million and hope this  will  take  service  delivery
closer to the communities. We gave all that  money  to  the  districts,  and
hope the Minister is pleased with our decision, because we  want  the  money
nearer to our communities.

To promote co-operative governance with the national and local  spheres,  we
are working together with  local  government,  district  municipalities  and
nodal points as directed in the President's speech of 9 February  2001,  the
hon the Minister's speech previously in the National Assembly and  today  in
this House. Our district managers have  the  specific  mandate  to  dovetail
their activities  with  those  of  the  local  authorities  where  they  are
situated.

Through co-operation and an integrated service  delivery  improvement  plan,
our cluster's improved service delivery in our province lies in  making  the
cluster  work  and  integrating  service  delivery  not  only   within   the
department but also between the provincial  departments  and  the  different
spheres of government.

I  would  like  to  come  to  a  few  individual  programmes.  For   poverty
alleviation funding, we received R7,7 million from the national  department.
We will  use  this  money  successfully  to  construct  multipurpose  sports
facilities,  like  fields  and  buildings.  The  nodal  points  within   our
different municipalities will be located  at  Cofimvaba  -  I  am  going  to
struggle with this name.
An HON MEMBER: Cofimvaba.

Ms H H MALGAS: Thank you. I am going to struggle, so I just have to look  at
my page.

We are giving R500 000 to those areas.  Mount  Fletcher,  Tsolo,  Ntabankulu
and Mqanduli will  each  get  R796  000.  The  facilities  I  mentioned  are
designed to include access for the disabled.

HIV/Aids is rife in the schools and communities of our  province.  They  are
statistics without names. We  will  be  using  sport  and  recreation  as  a
vehicle in our awareness campaigns  in  the  following  nodal  points:  Lady
Frere, Mount Fletcher, Ntabankulu, Motherwell and Mdantsane. Each area  will
receive R50 000.

Sport, as we know is an integral part of  our  society,  especially  in  the
Eastern Cape, where we have a long and  proud  tradition  of  producing  top
achievers like our Minister.

The department recognises  the  potential  of  sport  as  a  nation-building
agent. Moreover, sport has the inherent ability to touch a large  number  of
our citizens. As in the previous  year,  the  department  will  continue  to
deliver quality sports services ranging from coaching  to  material  support
to our communities.

I will now touch on individual programmes. The Minister  mentioned  one.  On
Saturday 19 May we had our indigenous and traditional  games  at  Flagstaff,
and for that  event  the  department  gave  R70 000.  I  am  sorry  that  Mr
Ackermann is not here. [Interjections.] Is  he  behind  me?  We  had  stick-
fighting and ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Order! Hon member,  please  address  the
Chair and not Mr Ackermann.

Ms H H MALGAS: Madam Chair, I am sorry. [Laughter.]

One can see I come from the Eastern Cape, we are unruly  when  it  comes  to
heckling. [Laughter.]
That, I hope will take things further.

A sum of R80 000 was received for talent  identification  in  school  sport.
The province will hold school sport development games in Aliwal North.

I would also like  to  mention  that  we  will  have  events  preparing  our
athletes in the 16-to-18 age  group  as  a  build-up  to  provincial,  South
African and Olympic Games to monitor school sports. I am  reading  from  the
chairperson's notes.

Athletes from farm schools will  participate  in  a  national  farm  schools
festival. The Minister, when he visited the Eastern  Cape,  gave  us  a  few
pointers on what to look at. We were concerned about school sport.  We  made
a  recommendation  to  our  department  saying  that  the   department,   in
conjunction with the department of education, should work out a policy  that
governs school sport. We hope to have that policy by July 2001.

We also looked at children's activities in crèches and  preschools.  As  hon
members know, school sport is the nursery of sport itself. We  felt  it  was
very important that there should  be  an  integrated,  cluster  approach  to
activities in our  social  needs  structure  where  matters  are  linked  to
welfare. Our department of sport is leading, followed by the  department  of
health.

We asked our department to initiate youth activities and  to  link  them  to
the premier's office.

When it comes to women in sport, there is a  special  programme  looking  at
the interests  of  the  youth,  women  and  the  disabled.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, the best public relations officer ever  for
sport in South Africa was the previous President of South Africa,  President
Nelson Mandela.

In 1995 he united a very divided South Africa in a  single  moment  when  he
congratulated the Springbok rugby world champions and  rejoiced  with  them.
When he appeared on the rugby field wearing a Springbok captain's  number  6
jersey, a miracle of unification really started happening in South Africa.

We all realise  the  bridge-building  power  of  the  Amabhokobhoko,  Bafana
Bafana, Amakroko-kroko and the Amaglug-glug and we must  keep  on  promoting
this process through the instrument of sport. We must build on it.

The hon the  Minister  is  doing  his  utmost  and  is  succeeding  in  many
respects, although we will never be able to fit him into a number 6  jersey.
[Laughter.] Maybe, when we are the champions again, we can try and  get  him
a number 1, 2 or 3 jersey, and I hope he will still fit into that.

I hope the hon the Minister  realises  now  that  he  misread  the  previous
debate completely. But I understand why it happened! It  is  because  he  is
not in this House so often. It really sounded like an election rally, as  if
he was canvassing for candidates. I excuse the Minister for  that.  Actually
I think we should have given the Minister  a  red  card,  but  we  did  not.
[Laughter.]

In an era in which the importance of sports  to  national  issues,  such  as
nation-building, is being recognised, and in which big fortunes stand to  be
made by outstanding  sportsmen  and  sportswomen,  in  which  the  potential
exists for all talented people to participate and make it big in  the  world
of sport, we need to pose a serious question to ourselves: How  equipped  is
our sporting talent to fulfil their real potential? If  they  are  not  well
enough equipped, how can administrators facilitate the  attainment  of  this
goal?

Are we as politicians, or as administrators, in a position to criticise  the
athletes for not  always  living  up  to  our  expectations?  Our  country's
sporting image,  regrettably,  is  repeatedly  tainted  by  one  unfortunate
incident after the other. We had the match-fixing  scandal  in  cricket,  we
had a tennis boss calling  one  of  our  country's  most  successful  tennis
players, and someone who is indeed doing something for  the  development  of
the sport, too white to be a role model.

We had our players in our national cricket team smoking dagga  in  the  West
Indies, and now being mocked as the Amadagga-dagga. [Laughter.] We have  the
allegations of corruption that  are  being  levelled  against  the  top  ASA
officials and then we have the decision by ASDA's selectors not  to  include
athletes in the squad for  the  World  Athletics  Championships  later  this
year, because, at 25 years of age, they are deemed to be  old,  disregarding
their performances. [Interjections.]

Are we doing enough to develop the enormous potential  of  our  athletes  in
South Africa? As long as we continue to  racialise,  to  politicise  and  to
maladministrate our sport in this country, I  can  assure  hon  members,  we
will continue to face the above negatives in sport for quite a long time  to
come. [Interjections.] Why are our teams and athletes,  with  the  exception
of a few, not delivering the performances we know they can?  The  answer  is
simple: We do not invest enough in our sportsmen and sportswomen.

Investment  amounts  to  more  than  the  mere  availability  of  funds  for
development programmes in sport alone. It also implies a  responsibility  on
the part of our sports Ministry to see to it that these funds are  correctly
applied. It implies that our athletes should be the ones  who  benefit,  not
the  administrators  alone.  It  also  implies  investment  in  a   holistic
approach.

Daarom verwelkom ons die kreatiewe wyse waarop die  krieketraad  gister  vir
Herschelle Gibbs gestraf het. Ek is oortuig dat die verpligting  om  terapie
in sosiale en professionele vaardighede te ondergaan nie net  vir  hom  goed
is nie, maar ook 'n voorbeeld stel vir die duisende jong mense  vir  wie  hy
'n rolmodel is.

Ons  moet  die  ondersteuners  van  ons  sport  nooit  vergeet  nie.   Hulle
veiligheid en gerief moet na omgesien word. Ook ons skoolsport, en  ek  dank
die Minister vir wat hy reeds aangekondig het daaroor, is uiters  belangrik.
Daar word nie genoeg aandag aan ons amateursport gegee nie, en  dit  is  die
voedingsbron vir ons groot suksesse vorentoe.

Die nuwe Suid-Afrika het geleenthede geskep wat vir so baie mense in die  ou
Suid-Afrika ontneem was. Soveel  swartmense  is  geleenthede  vir  deelname,
provinsiaal, nasionaal, en  uit  die  aard  van  die  saak,  internasionaal,
ontneem. Dit moet nou reggestel word.

Ten slotte wil ek vir u en die Huis vertel van Bennie Oldewage, 'n kind  wat
'n asmalyer was. Hy was daar uit die  Noord-Kaap,  uit  Prieska  se  wêreld.
Bennie het om gesondheidsredes met gewigte begin oefen op die plaas. Hy  het
so  ontwikkel  dat  hy,  gedurende  die  eerste  nasionale   kompetisie   in
gewigoptel waarin hy gaan deelneem  het,  al  die  rekords  geslaan  het  in
daardie ouderdom en gewigsgrens. Hy  het  toe  selfs  in  senior  kategorieë
deelgeneem.

Hy het later 'n Springbok geword. Daar is nou nog wêreldrekords van hom  wat
staan, maar Bennie Oldewage kon nooit aan die Olimpiese Spele  deelneem  nie
omdat apartheid daar was. [Tussenwerpsels.] Omdat  hy  geraak  is  deur  die
sanksies wat op sport van toepassing was, kon hy nie daar deelneem nie.  Dit
is net so 'n  onreg  as  die  onreg  wat  swartmense  aangedoen  is  in  die
apartheidstyd om nie te kon deelneem nie.

Bennie Oldewage ... [Tyd verstreke.] [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[We therefore welcome  the  creative  manner  in  which  the  cricket  board
penalised Herschelle Gibbs yesterday. I am convinced that the obligation  to
undergo therapy in social and professional skills is not only good for  him,
but also sets an example to the  thousands  of  young  people  for  whom  he
serves as a role model.

We must never forget the supporters of our sport. Their safety  and  comfort
must be seen to. This includes our school sport, and I  thank  the  Minister
for what he has  already  announced  in  this  regard,  which  is  extremely
important. Not enough attention is devoted to our amateur sport and this  is
the source of our future major successes.

The new  South  Africa  created  opportunities  that  so  many  people  were
deprived of in the old South  Africa.  So  many  black  people  were  denied
opportunities  to  participate  provincially,  nationally  and,  of  course,
internationally. This must now be rectified.

In conclusion I want to tell you and the House of Bennie Oldewage,  who  was
an asthma sufferer. He hailed from the Northern  Cape  region,  the  Prieska
area. For health reasons Bennie started training with weights on  the  farm.
He developed to such a degree that, in  the  first  national  weight-lifting
competition in which he participated, he broke all the records  in  his  age
and weight groups. He then even participated in senior categories.

He later became a Springbok. There are  world  records  of  his  that  still
stand, but Bennie Oldewage could never  participate  in  the  Olympic  Games
because of apartheid.  [Interjections.]  Because  he  was  affected  by  the
sanctions against sport that were in force he could  not  participate.  This
is just as much an injustice as that which  black  people  suffered  because
they could not participate during the apartheid era.

Bennie Oldewage ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Mr E COLEMAN (KwaZulu-Natal): Mr Chairperson, hon Minister,  colleagues  and
people present, I have taken a few facts from the provincial plan,  which  I
would like to tell you  about.  In  KwaZulu-Natal,  sport  is  part  of  the
department of education and culture. The education department is  demarcated
into eight regions, and the sports section is led by an assistant  director.
The assistant directors are headed by the Chief Director, Dr E Khanyile.

Sadly, due to financial restraints, the staff complement of the  directorate
is 35 officials. This is for serving the  entire  province.  Structures  for
sport and recreation have also been put in place. Many sport and  recreation
festivals and events are organised. Senior citizens, inmates in  prison  and
street  children  are  catered  for  by  all  regions.  They  organise  mass
participation recreation events. The Masidlale  Festival  was  initiated  in
Port Shepstone last year, and it  attracted  up  to  3  000  people  in  one
weekend with at least 80% actively participating in the festival.

In some districts there were old women who assembled early  in  the  morning
to participate in a fun  run.  In  order  to  ensure  gender  equality,  all
regions have the provincial women in sport committees  in  place  for  Women
and Sport SA. All regions ensure, when running courses, that  at  least  40%
of the participants are women.

During the year self-defence workshops were held in the Ladysmith and  South
Durban regions. For the first time in our province,  a  group  of  15  women
qualified as soccer referees. A walking programme for young girls and  women
was launched last year, and many of them will be participating in  the  Spar
10 km Women's Challenge on 1 July.

The sports facilities in the province will, for many  years  to  come,  need
attention. R3,9 million has been allocated to KwaZulu-Natal.  We  thank  the
National Treasury and the Minister of Sport and Recreation for  the  amount,
and we look forward to a bigger slice in years to come.

Our premier sports award function is an annual event, and it is a big  event
in the province. This will  take  place  on  Wednesday,  13  June.  At  this
function we honour those sportpersons who have distinguished  themselves  in
the field of sport.  Awards  are  made  on  the  basis  of  achievements  at
provincial,  national  and  international  levels.   Besides   participants,
administrators,  coaches,  technical  officials  and  the  media  are  given
recognition.  Those who  have  never  been  recognised  before  are  awarded
lifetime achievement awards.

One of the  sad  items  to  report,  though,  is  when  we  complete  sports
facilities and they are vandalised, as was the case this  week.  The  sports
facility was completed and lights were installed around  the  soccer  field.
On Tuesday, when I went along to have a look, two of the poles had been  cut
down and the lights from the top had both been taken away.

An HON MEMBER: Shame.

Mr E COLEMAN (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairman, for those who are not interested  in
sport: Yes, it is a shame to see lights valued at about R10  000  not  there
any more. Then one goes into the rural areas where  they  have  these  sport
venues which have been put up, and one looks and sees no  lines  around  the
field. They cannot afford to pay for whitewash.

These are some of the sad things that make the people who  have  taken  part
in sport look on and think: We should be doing a little bit more to try  and
revive the sport. I have taken  part  in  sport  for  many  years,  and  our
Minister quoted something which I thought was something to bear in mind.  It
has to do with the smaller sports, for instance table tennis. In  1994,  the
world body allowed three or four Swedish players to come and take part in  a
tour of the country. Since then, sad to say, there has been no  choice,  but
our possibly five top players and six  or  eight  officials  have  gone  and
attended the world championships.

Now, we talk about going to areas and, surely, one or two of  those  players
are getting hammered in most cases anyway. Could they not stay at home?  Let
us bring out the Japanese and the Chinese, the professionals of  the  sport,
and imagine them touring parts of KwaZulu-Natal, places like Eshowe and  all
parts of the country in the rural areas. Imagine what it would do  for  this
sport! If we send 10 people to Portugal and five people  to  Mauritius,  who
actually benefits from that, especially in this ball sport?

I would ask the Minister, when he looks at those budgets  that  come  before
him, to bear this in mind, because after  35  years  the  administration  in
table tennis needs attention, and I can talk a little bit of what I know.  I
am sure there are other sports to be treated possibly the same.

Where development is the key, we have 1 000 players playing.  Would  not  it
be great in five years time to say that there are 30 000 playing  now?  That
is our problem. We are concentrating on those very  few  supposed  champions
who really, in most cases, are a waste of time  anyway,  because  they  have
not reached the standard required.

I would just like to say that I am a  newcomer  to  Parliament.  [Laughter.]
Maybe, maybe not. I have only been  around  for  six  or  nine  months,  but
definitely, I will be a key watcher of the sports facilities, especially  in
KwaZulu-Natal. I will obviously be keeping in touch with  the  Minister  and
making sure that things improve.

One of the things that were  quite  interesting  to  note  even  this  week,
although it might be a small little item, is that the KwaZulu-Natal  finance
committee agreed, for the first time, to earmark the money  statements  that
they bring out each month. They are now going to have education, sports  and
arts and culture. Now we will be able to see where that money is going.

Personally I am very keen to see where that money is going. I  want  to  see
where the Baptists are.  Are  they  going  into  that  area  and  doing  the
coaching which they should be doing? Are the Doctor Khumalos, the greats  of
soccer, going out into the areas? Are they doing the work  which  should  be
done? Sad to say, I doubt it. [Applause.]

Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, on a point of order: Can I  raise  a  point  of
order? It is a very serious one.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Yes,  hon  member,
raise it.

Mr C ACKERMANN:  Chairperson,  on  a  point  of  order:  You  can  see  that
according to the speakers' list Mr Williams  was  to  have  participated  in
this  debate.  He  is  the  chairperson  of  the  Western  Cape   education,
environment and cultural affairs committee. It was announced over the  radio
this morning that five people had been killed in Marine Drive.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): But what is the  point
of order? The list that I have does not include Mr Williams.

Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson,  I  just  want  to  inform  the  House  why  Mr
Williams is not participating, and I thought I could  do  it  by  way  of  a
point of order.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  L  Mushwana):  Order!  Mr  van
Niekerk, I do not think that is a point of order. That is a matter  for  the
Whips to deal with. We do not want to encroach on  Whippery  matters.  I  am
following the speakers' list before me.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I  have  indicated  through  the
table staff that Mr Williams' family members, I  think  his  niece  and  his
daughter, were quite critically hurt in the collision, and that he would  be
excused, and Mrs Witbooi would be speaking on his behalf.  So  the  Whippery
has done what is necessary, and we are seriously concerned, as he is,  about
their welfare. The information that Mr Ackermann wishes to  convey  has,  in
fact, been conveyed through the Table to the Chairperson, and  the  Minister
has been alerted as well.

Mrs J WITBOOI: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members,  please  allow  me
to render the apology of the MEC for sport and  recreation  in  the  Western
Cape for his absence due  to  other  urgent  commitments.  Therefore  it  is
indeed an honour and a privilege for me to address this Budget Vote  on  his
behalf.

Let me start off by thanking the national Minister of Sport  and  Recreation
and his department for the work they are doing at  national  level.  We,  in
the Western Cape, are in total agreement with the view of the Minister  that
sport can be used to build a nation and accelerate change.

Indeed, as the Minister indicated in his budget speech, the  youth  form  an
integral part of the building of the nation. We, in the Western  Cape,  have
realised this fact. We are engaging in a number of activities on  Youth  Day
to celebrate the cause of youth and to attract them to the cause of  nation-
building.

The provincial department will therefore host the following events on  Youth
Day: Youth Day sport and  recreation  festivals  at  Worcester,  Plettenberg
Bay, Calitzdorp, Oudtshoorn, and Hartenbos, as well as  a  community  sports
day in Ocean View. The Pedro Page memorial soccer tournament  will  also  be
held at Parkwood.

There is absolutely no doubt that  sport  has  to  take  its  place  in  the
struggle to transform South  Africa  and  build  our  nation.  I  think  our
national Minister will agree with me when I say that it  is  not  enough  to
ensure representivity at the highest levels  of  sport,  like  the  national
hockey and Springbok sides.

The key here is what underpins that high-profile representivity.  Are  these
sports, which show representivity at the top levels,  transformed  in  their
operations and committed to the building of  clubs  and  structures  in  all
communities? Have they truly  embraced  the  concepts  of  nonracialism  and
democracy?

It is no good if we are merely happy, and if there  are  more  blacks  in  a
team. The issue of transformation is a more fundamental one. It goes  beyond
a mere number scale. These are the hard questions which  need  to  be  asked
beyond the few opportunities for high-profile sportspersons.

If we fail to ask these questions, we  cannot  be  said  to  be  engaged  in
transforming our society. I am also looking forward to a formal report  from
the  ministerial  task  team  which  will  outline  the   full   roles   and
responsibilities  of  all  who  are  involved  in  the  preparation  of  our
athletes.

But  it  is  my  considered  view  that  no  amount  of  reorganisation  and
restructuring can detract  from  the  fact  that  South  Africa  will  never
produce the performance we desired  as  long  as  our  participation  levels
remain as low as they are.

Therefore, I was disappointed to see  that  the  vision  of  the  SA  Sports
Commission was ``to lead South Africa to sporting  excellence,''  whilst  we
know that this will never happen, unless there is an emphasis and  focus  on
participation.

I trust that the task team will honestly look at these questions  to  ensure
a proper model which can produce peak performances with  a  clear  placement
of roles and responsibilities.

In the Western Cape, we are busy with the establishment of the Western  Cape
sports forum. Through this forum, civil society will  work  in  tandem  with
its Government agencies to ensure the  delivery  of  sport  to  all  in  the
region. Indeed, this forum will be the voice of civil society, and will  act
as a platform to ensure that ordinary sportspeople in the Western Cape  have
the leverage to raise issues with Government.

Only a truly symbiotic relationship between Government and society  can  set
the correct framework for advancement. We will not merely raise  our  voices
if not enough blacks are in  a  team.  Instead,  we  should  focus  on  what
actually goes on in our federations. The fact that a team has a  significant
number of black players in it does not mean that it has been transformed.

The Western Cape is also in agreement  with  the  view  that  sport  funding
should be prioritised. We need look no further than the  American  model  of
sport funding to see that their success in sports like athletics,  baseball,
American  football  and  basketball  is  the  result  of  a  strategic   and
prioritised approach.

In the Western Cape, we have taken into account, as  our  main  thrust,  the
fact that we want more of our citizens to  play  sport  and  hence  we  have
chosen five sporting codes for special growth potential over the next  three
years  in  our  province.  These  are   football,   athletics,   volleyball,
basketball and softball.  Secondary  focal  points  are  netball,  baseball,
swimming, hockey and boxing.

It is only via a sustained strategically focused approach that  we  will  be
able to attain our goal of getting the nation  to  play.  From  a  sustained
participation platform such as this, we will be able to debate the  question
of performance, and the advances in this regard.

To this end, the Western Cape's department of sport and recreation  will  be
entering into performance agreements with these codes of sports that  should
have definitive outcomes.

I want to thank  the  Minister  and  his  department.  There  is  also  much
appreciation for the work being done in terms of the  poverty  relief  funds
for the building  of  facilities  across  the  length  and  breadth  of  our
country. I want to give the Minister an  assurance  of  the  Western  Cape's
support in this regard.

I am also glad to note that  school  sport  is  now  finally  occupying  the
spotlight which is due to this important sector. As the  Minister  indicated
in his budget speech, this is a sector which needs to have  clearly  defined
partners in Government. At a provincial level we have a  fairly  clear  idea
of where we want to take the process, and  the  Western  Cape  has  recently
completed a draft school sport policy document for discussion.

This will soon go out to our provincial cabinet for formal  adoption.  I  am
glad to say that we have drafted this policy in collaboration with  all  the
stakeholders in our province.  I  therefore  welcome  the  decision  of  the
Minister to call a school sport indaba for all  stakeholders  to  deliberate
on the way forward.

The indigenous games project represents another milestone in the  annals  of
South African sporting history. In the Western Cape  we  have  grabbed  this
project, and we are pushing full steam ahead, with sustained training  being
given in all seven games identified to a variety  of  communities.  We  look
forward to the roll-out of the  national  games  in  this  regard,  and  the
Western Cape is looking at following the lead of the Eastern Cape to try  to
open its own chapter.
May I add my words of sympathy to the  families  of  those  who  lost  their
lives in the Ellis Park stadium tragedy. This tragic event has to  serve  as
a wake-up call to all of us, and I want to ask the Minister to  pass  on  my
province's thanks to the  President  and  the  Cabinet  for  the  speed  and
dignity with which they have handled this difficult matter, and appointed  a
commission of inquiry. We look forward to its recommendations.

Meanwhile, the Western Cape has already begun to call  all  stakeholders  in
the province  together  to  start  to  look  at  the  question  of  disaster
management at sports stadiums in this province. Let us never again  have  to
stand here before this House debating an issue of this nature.

It would be remiss of me not to comment on the recent events in  cricket  as
they pertain to our province, especially since  three  of  the  top  players
from our province were involved and fined.

I want to appeal to the Minister to assist in  putting  in  place  mentoring
programmes  for  our  top  athletes,  especially  those  from  disadvantaged
backgrounds. By this, I do not mean sport mentoring. I mean life  mentoring,
guidance  about  choices,  and  clear  values-building  and   awareness   of
responsibilities. This is a  matter  that  the  Western  Cape  is  seriously
considering taking  up  with  our  provincial  sports  federations  via  the
Western Cape Sports Academy.

When our athletes step out onto the field of play,  they  carry  our  hopes,
dreams and aspirations. They also carry on their  shoulders  the  burden  of
responsibility to  conduct  themselves  in  a  manner  befitting  the  lofty
positions which they occupy. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, hon Minister  and  hon  members,  presumably,
most of us at one stage or another have  been  involved  in  some  sport  or
leisure. In those instances, we had to observe certain rules.

I am reading here a list of  some  attributes  of  fair  play.  Among  other
things, it calls on players to be sober when entering the field of  play.  I
repeat, it calls on players to be sober when entering  the  field  of  play.
[Laughter.]

Among other things, it also demands that players  play  games  according  to
their rules, and accept that a referee's decision is final. The  purpose  of
play is to entertain, and not to tackle, maim or  cripple  one's  opponents.
Lastly, it also says that players must not leave the field of  play  without
the referee's consent. [Laughter.]

Playing is also about recreation, but then, at  the  end  of  the  day,  the
winners are not necessarily the  victors,  or  the  heroes.  We  could  have
winners who would be seen as villains, and those are  the  people  who  will
not accept defeat gracefully, with composure, and all that sport calls  upon
them to do.

Let me extend my  congratulations  to  and  commend  the  Minister  for  his
unwavering commitment and unselfish contribution, and  for  his  efforts  at
levelling  the  playing  fields  which  have  benefited  millions  of  South
Africans. Political developments since 1992 laid the foundation  for  sports
federations in South Africa to become democratic  and,  indeed,  instruments
of change.  These  developments  also  led  to  the  transformation  of  the
National Olympic Committee of SA, as well as the  National  Sports  Council,
as macro bodies for sport in the country.

The integration of the racially based sports organisations in  South  Africa
reflected, or  rather  epitomised  more  generally,  the  changes  in  South
African society, and became a tool  for  challenging  the  deeply  ingrained
divisions within civil society. Some federations, however,  have  found  the
steps required to complete transformation too big for  them.  It  is  common
knowledge that  certain  federations,  some  of  which  are  rurally  based,
continue  to  exclude  black  sportspeople  from  either  their   management
structures, participation or access to facilities.

The hon Minister Balfour, in his budget speech  in  the  National  Assembly,
issued a stern warning to these federations and  administrators  who  refuse
to adapt to the principles  of  transformation  and  development.  There  is
ample evidence to support these claims. One such example is the attitude  of
rugby  unions  in  Gauteng  and  the  Northern  Bulls  rugby   club,   whose
administrators  still  vote  on   colour   lines   in   order   to   prevent
administrators of colour from coming into their respective executives.  This
they do in the guise of using their majority vote to  achieve  their  racist
objectives.  By  so  doing  they  undermine   not   only   the   spirit   of
transformation, but also that of nation-building.

Let me add, though, that this phenomenon is not unique to rugby. I  am  also
convinced  that  the  conference  on  transformation  later  this  year,  as
suggested  by  the  Minister,  will  provide  us   with   a   barometer   of
transformation across the sport spectrum.

In  conclusion,  let  me  hastily  add  that   the   perception   of   sport
transformation in the country, as epitomised by my hon member  Mrs  Witbooi,
leaves much to be desired. I would  also  add  that  she  has  displayed  an
urgent need for a series of intense workshops on the subject. [Applause.]

Mr M W MFEBE (Free State) Mr Chairperson, hon  Minister,  hon  delegates,  I
feel extremely nostalgic taking part in this debate for the  first  time  in
four years. I left these corridors of national power after I had  served  as
a member of both the  National  Assembly  and  Constitutional  Assembly  for
three years. In my time there was nothing called the DA, which is  a  forced
marriage between two strange bedfellows, the New NP and the DP.

When I watch television back home and sometimes when I come here, I  realise
that they are solely responsible for the highest levels of  political  noise
pollution in both Chambers of Parliament. Perhaps  the  President  needs  to
give me a chance to come back and just do a political  environmental  impact
study ... [Laughter.] ... in order to recycle the political waste of the  DA
into  a  useful  product  that  will  enhance  debate  in  both  Houses   of
Parliament, to benefit the country within and outside our borders.

However, for now, allow me to join colleagues in  giving  undivided  support
to our Minister in his Budget Vote. Our support for the Minister is  support
for our Government, which was democratically elected by the people  of  this
country. Our support for our democratically elected  Government  is  support
for the very people who put this Government in power.

As the MEC responsible for sport in  the  Free  State,  allow  me  to  raise
issues pertinent to the  Free  State,  covering  the  following  areas:  the
provincial plan  for  sport,  school  sport,  gender  equality,  racism  and
indigenous  sport.  Our  provincial  plan  for  sport  is  informed  by  two
imperatives, the constitutional and policy imperatives. The Constitution  of
the Republic of South Africa places the  area  of  provincial  sport  as  an
exclusive competence of provinces.

In order to carry out our exclusive constitutional mandate, we in  the  Free
State have, through the participation of  all  stakeholders,  developed  and
adopted a Free  State  Provincial  White  Paper  on  Sport  and  Recreation.
Although this policy is being implemented  on  an  ongoing  basis,  we  have
realised that we need a scientific approach to the  implementation  of  this
policy so that we can have scientific information  for  decision-making  and
be able to quantify the tangible benefits for our people.

We have enlisted help from our  international  friends,  in  this  case  the
Flemish government in Belgium, with whom we have set up  a  project  of  co-
operation which is within the framework agreement between the South  African
and  Flemish  governments.  This  project  of   co-operation   covers   four
implementation  programmes,  namely  the  strategic  plans,  education   and
training programmes, the Flemish-Free State Sport Scholarship Fund  and  the
exchange of athletes.

The primary  objective  of  the  programme  on  the  implementation  of  the
strategic plan is to carry out a strategic analysis of the  White  Paper  on
Sport and Recreation in order to develop  a  strategic  plan  for  the  Free
State. This will also help us in decision-making, so that resources  in  the
province can be taken where they are needed the  most  and  results  can  be
measured.

Coming to the programme on education and training, its primary objective  is
twofold. The first is to start jointly  an  education  programme  that  will
develop volunteer programmes. Volunteerism is necessary in  sport  in  South
Africa, and in our provinces.  We  need  to  develop  programmes  to  assist
volunteers. The second objective is to  establish  a  network  of  expertise
with our partners, who can send experts on coaching.

Regarding the envisaged coaching academy, which we are  working  on  in  the
Free State, we have realised that one of the major reasons that  performance
in sport is the way it in South Africa is the lack of  a  strategy  that  is
focused on developing the coaches - training the trainers - which  Australia
has applied with great success. Having  performed  badly  in  the  preceding
years, Australia looked at this strategy and  developed  it.  They  are  now
number four in the whole world  in  the  Olympic  Games,  having  come  from
nowhere, because they applied that strategy of developing the coaches.

The  Flemish-Free  State  Sport  Scholarship  Fund  is  aimed   at   helping
disadvantaged students to enrol  for  the  new  degree  in  Applied  Leisure
Sciences at the Free State University, which has specialist  areas  such  as
high-performance coaching and facilities management.

We have invited all provinces to participate in  this  programme.  Only  six
provinces could make it in time for the academic year. As I  am  talking  to
the  hon  members,  some  of  the  eight  disadvantaged  students  will,  as
professional coaches, come up  to   international  standards.  They  can  be
employed anywhere in the world. The academic  programme  is  internationally
accredited, through the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.
We also realised that there were problems at Ellis Park, and  elsewhere,  in
the management of events and facilities. That programme will also  advantage
South Africans from these provinces, where we have set as  a  priority  that
half of those participating should be women. It was  not  a  request  but  a
directive from me to say that  in  order  to  make  an  impact  we  need  to
seriously take women on board.

The fourth programme, which  is  the  exchange  of  athletes,  is  aimed  at
providing for the mutual exchange of athletes, high- performance  and  elite
potential athletes, for advanced training and  conditioning  camps.  In  the
Free State, we are in a unique position where we  have  training  facilities
at altitudes at more than 1 700 metres  above  sea  level  in  the  area  of
Qwaqwa, which we can use to our advantage to  promote  our  facilities  with
our international partners, so that when they come to the  Free  State  they
can make use of those facilities. Our athletes, coaches  and  administrators
will have the  advantage  of  going  to  Belgium  to  be  exposed  to  their
facilities in terms of athlete conditioning and high-performance  programmes
in that area.

In the area of gender equality, we have a policy of sport and recreation  in
the Free State whose theme is ``Getting Free State  active'',  which  is  in
line with the White Paper on Sport and Recreation, whose theme is  ``Getting
the Nation to Play''. We have articulated our vision with the  participation
of all stakeholders as to what we want  to  achieve.  The  participation  of
women and girls in sport is not a by-the-way thing, but a must in  order  to
realise the full potential of all our people in the  province  and  also  in
the country.

Although there are successes here and  there  -  for  example,  we  see  the
emergence of women referees in soccer, women technical officials  and  women
judges in boxing, as we have been talking about  the  South  African  Boxing
Bill - there is a lot more that can be done. The only  way  we  can  achieve
that is by heeding what the chairperson said in his speech: that we need  to
look at the funding policy.

As I will be coming to the racism in sport section,  I  need  to  say,  now,
that no racist sport will receive  a  cent  from  the  programmes  that  are
designed to level  the  playing  field  in  our  province.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mntw B Z ZULU:  Sihlalo,  Ngqongqoshe  wezemiDlalo  nezikaQedisizungu,  Ndlu
yoMkhandlu  kaZwelonke  weziFundazwe,   ukungabikhona   kwezinto   zokudlala

uDkt H F Verwoed. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Prince B Z ZULU: Chairperson, Minister of  Sport  and  Recreation  and  the
NCOP, we  should  look  at  the  lack  of  sport  facilities  in  previously
disadvantaged communities as a horrible situation  since  it  resulted  from
the apartheid principle called the Bantu Education  policy.  This  apartheid
policy was made in such a way that most black people in this country  should
receive an education that was not based  on  skills.  Black  women  went  to
school so that they could be trained  to  become  domestic  workers  in  the
kitchens of white madams.

The protection of whites in  the  areas  of  education  and  sport  was  the
principle of the NP that was established by the Minister of Native  Affairs,
Dr H F Verwoerd.]

Whilst our approach to sport  and  recreation  has  to  be  based  on  South
African values and beliefs, geography, community, history and heritage,  our
national sport and recreation has to be responsive to global influence.  The
challenge in the provision of facilities  in  South  Africa  is  not  simply
about  the  shortage  of  facilities,  but  rather  about  the  location  of
facilities. They are just not where the majority of the people are.

Furthermore, it is a considered approach of the Ministry and the  Department
of Sport and Recreation to provide  multipurpose  facilities  in  the  focal
point of each community.

Ukudlala kuyingxenye yezinto ezibalulekile empilweni yomuntu.  Umuntu  uqala
ukudlala  esewumbungu  esibelethweni  sikanina.  Lokhu  kunyakaza   kokuqala
okwaziwa ngunina  kunikeza  injabulo  enkulu  kuye.  Kuyisibusiso  angekwazi

Kuyaye kuthi noma isizelwe unina  ayibone  kuqala  ukuthi  ayiphilile  ngoba
ingadlali ngalolo lusuku. Ukudlala yikhona okuqinisa umzimba.

Ngizophawula    ngibhekise    ekuthuthukisweni    kwezemidlalo    ezindaweni
zasemakhaya. Ukungabi bikho  kwezindawo  zokudlala  ezindaweni  zasemakhaya;
kwenza  ukuba  abadlali   abaningi   abanamakhono   ahlukahlukene   bafuduke
bayohlala  emadolobheni.  Abahambi  ngoba  benyanya  ukuhlala   bathuthukise
imidlalo  emakhaya  kepha  basuke  beya  ezindaweni  ezinezidingo  zokudlala
ezanele.  Abadlali  basezindaweni   esezithuthukisiwe   bafinyelela   kalula
emadlelweni aluhlaza.

Izikole  ezisezindaweni  zasemakhaya  azinazo  neze  izikhungo   zezemidlalo

zaseNingizimu Afrika.

Thina bantu base-Afrika sinemidlalo yethu  yendabuko.  Eminye  yale  midlalo

Sinomdlalo omunye obizwa ngokuthi ukuciba insema. Lapho,  kusuke  kuqeqeshwa
abafana ukuba babe nekhono lokunemba ngomkhonto uma sebezingela noma  sebeya

enjengomkhanunu,  umlabalaba,  ugqaphu  kanye  nengcuva.  Yonke  le  midlalo
iyakudinga kakhulu ukwesekwa ngezimali  ukuze  nayo  ikhule  ize  ifinyelele
ezingeni  lomhlaba.  Siyazibonga-ke  futhi  sizikhuthaza   lezo   zifundazwe
eseziqalele ukuvuselela leyo midlalo yethu yendabuko. (Translation  of  Zulu
paragraphs follows.)

[Playing is an important part of the life of a human being. A person  starts
playing while he is still a fetus. The movement made  by  a  fetus  for  the
first time gives pleasure to a woman. It is  a  blessing,  which  cannot  be
explained. It is also a sign of the  good  health  of  the  fetus.  A  woman
checks every day if the fetus plays. Even after  delivery,  the  mother  can
tell if there is something wrong with the baby, particularly if  it  is  not
playing that day. Playing strengthens the body.

I am going to talk about sports development in the rural areas.  A  lack  of
sport facilities in the rural  areas  causes  many  players  with  different
talents to move to urban areas. They do not leave the  rural  areas  because
they do not want to improve sports there, but because they  want  to  be  in
places where there are enough sports facilities.  Players  who  are  in  the
developed areas climb the ladder of success very easily.

Rural schools do not have different types of  sports  facilities.  They  are
far behind in providing needs, like urban schools have. It gives us hope  to
hear the department in this House talking  about  improving  sports  in  all
provinces of South Africa.

We, the South Africans, have our own traditional games. Some of these  games
are based on our traditions. It is saddening today, because it looks  as  if
these games will disappear because they are not sponsored so that  they  can
be developed. We have a game called ijadu, a  traditional  dance  for  which
people from different valleys come together and compete,  dancing  in  their
attire and singing traditional songs.

We also have another game called ukuciba insema, a game of dart-throwing  at
a rolling target. Here boys are trained how to stab so that  they  can  stab
well during hunting and in war battles. There are other different  kinds  of
games that we have in the rural areas like umkhanunu,  umlabalaba,  ingqathu
and ingcuva. All these games need to be financially sponsored so  that  they
can grow and reach the international level. We thank the department  and  we
also encourage those provinces that have started to play  traditional  games
again.]

Owing to the fact that sport and  recreation  activities  are  predominantly
practised in urban areas  and  are  largely  Eurocentric,  indigenous  games
have, over the years, been forgotten whilst others have  been  marginalised.
Indigenous games are essential in order to get more South  Africans  active.
This would impact on  a  number  of  issues  such  as  economic  growth  the
accessibility of resources in  international  participation,  education  and
training the African identity and restoring cultural diversity.

Mphathisihlalo,  thina  njengoKhongolose  siyaseseka   kakhulu   iSabiwomali
osethula kule Ndlu. [Ihlombe.] [Chairperson,  we  as  the  ANC  support  the
Budget Vote that has been presented in this House. [Applause.]]

Mrs C NKUNA: Hon Chair, hon Ministers and hon members, if  this  House  were
to have a soccer match, player Ackermann would be the first  to  get  a  red
card. [Laughter.] Let me quote the following:


  The whites and  different  nonwhite  groups  must  organise  their  sport
  separately and also under separate  control  bodies.  Although  nonwhites
  will be allowed to attend sports meetings at  facilities  where  separate
  amenities are available, the public opinion  at  the  moment  is  not  in
  favour of sports competitions between whites  and  nonwhites,  and  mixed
  sports teams are not approved of.

This statement was made in 1956 by  Dr  Dönges,  the  Minister  of  domestic
affairs, which stamped the official policy of the National Party  government
as far as sport and recreation were concerned  in  apartheid  South  Africa.
[Interjections.] This also stamped the beginning of the end  for  meaningful
international sports participation, as South  Africa's  sporting  ties  with
the rest of the world were slowly but surely being  cut  off.  What  it  did
achieve was to develop, with the active assistance of the private sector,  a
massive infrastructural  system  that  had  only  one  thing  in  mind:  the
development of the  white  minority.  Stadiums,  sports  centres  and  well-
equipped arenas were developed in white areas,  while  the  black  townships
were left in ruin.

The  democratic  South  Africa,  through  the  Department   of   Sport   and
Recreation, is the custodian of the overwhelming  majority  that  watch  and
support sport. [Interjections.] So we are here to  legislate,  and  we  have
legislated and will continue to do so in  order  to  uproot  the  ideologies
that the hon member still has.
School sport is seen as the nursery of  our  future  sports  stars  and,  as
such, needs all the support and recognition it deserves. At the  moment  the
United School Sport Association of SA is doing everything in  its  power  to
improve the image of school sport, despite the massive stumbling  blocks  it
is faced with.

Ussasa is busy implementing the Government's policy on sport and  recreation
at  school  level.  Its  business  will   include   talent   identification;
maximising  participation;   co-ordinating   interschool   and   intraschool
competitions; coaching and developmental  programmes  for  teachers;  giving
input to the physical education curriculum; and sharing facilities with  the
community.

This means that in order to improve the standard of school sports while,  at
the  same  time,  helping  Ussasa,  more  facilities  should  be   provided,
especially in the rural areas, the Northern Province in particular.

School sports should be made part of  physical  education  and  should  form
part of ongoing education restructuring, which includes  incorporation  into
Curriculum 2000. School sports  need  to  be  prioritised  and  all  efforts
should be made to ensure that school sports, wherever they are  played,  get
a generous budget that will sustain and assist  development  initiatives  at
this level. [Interjections.]

Efforts to transform our society - an  example  hon  members  can  hear  for
themselves - cannot  be  made  through  programmes  and  policy  initiatives
exclusively. Although these are indeed required  and  critically  essential,
it is my view that  transformation  depends,  to  a  large  extent,  on  the
transformation of the mindset and, in a way, on moving forward  collectively
with a common goal and vision.

Given all this and more, we must,  however,  emphasise  the  point  that  it
seems quite unfair to expect the Minister of Sport and Recreation to do  all
this work with a very limited budget.  We  understand  the  priorities  that
face our Government in terms of housing, education and  health,  but  we  do
believe that sport has played, and is playing, a vital role in  getting  our
people together, in combating crime  and  in  giving  our  young  people  an
opportunity to participate and excel in sport.

An idle mind breeds evil. A  child  in  sport  is  a  child  out  of  court.
[Interjections.] Spectators of all races on one  grandstand  will,  equally,
celebrate Shawn Bartlett when he scores a winning goal  for  Bafana  Bafana.
[Interjections.] And, again, the same will happen when Paulse scores  a  try
for Amabhokobhoko, the rugby team.

We have made tremendous strides in addressing the plight of women and  girls
in sport. I would like to mention some of  these  successes  while,  at  the
same time, raising the challenges that still confront us. Our Government  is
a signatory to the Brighton Declaration, which has, as its  main  objective,
the development of  sport  and  culture  that  enable  and  value  the  full
involvement of women in every aspect of sport. [Interjections.]
An HON MEMBER: Bafana Bafana must be 50% women.

Mrs C NKUNA: Let me change the hon member's mindset.  [Laughter.]  Regarding
rural women  in  the  Northern  Province,  our  rural  sports  programme  is
constrained to a few codes, for  example  soccer,  basketball  and  netball,
with facilities that are  limited.  However,  we  have  managed  to  produce
sportsmen and  sportswomen  of  the  likes  of  Ntabi  Ravhele,  Jomo  Sono,
Raphahlele, boxers such as  Ndou,  and  other  legendary  figures.  We  also
managed to produce soccer teams such as Ria  Stars,  which  is  led  by  Ria
herself, a woman, and Black Leopards  which  features  in  the  professional
soccer league.

In conclusion, in the Northern Province we  have  also  introduced  cultural
gains like Merabaraba,  Tinqedzo,  Khadzi,  etc.  We  particularly  wish  to
express our appreciation for the efforts of the department relating  to  the
process of job creation, via the activity of upgrading  and  erecting  basic
sport and recreation  facilities  in  disadvantaged  rural  areas.  This  is
clearly a poverty relief project which should be maintained. [Applause.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! We now call on the hon the  Minister  to
reply to the debate.

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Madam Chairperson, how do I  reply  to
all these issues? However, I think the first thing I should do is to try  to
register my distress at the news of the collision in  which  family  members
of the hon A J Williams were involved. We share in the  sadness  and  grief,
and I hope that the family recovers well.

I am always reminded of the fact that I am Presbyterian. I take my  position
in the Presbyterian church quite  seriously.  I  thought  I  should  mention
that. [Interjections.]

I want to thank all the  members  that  have  participated  in  the  debate.
[Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER. Me too?

The MINISTER: All the members. [Laughter.]

I think I should ask to be moved from the National  Assembly  to  the  NCOP.
This is quite a manageable situation and members are much  more  passionate,
vocal and mature. [Laughter.]

First of all I want to go through some things. The funding policy  that  the
hon Kgware spoke about is exactly the kind of funding that  we  are  dealing
with. If one does not work according to some of the criteria  that  we  have
set, we will look into that. We have a core group of federations.

We also have a level-2 group. We look at  them  according  to  the  criteria
that we have set. All of them know these criteria. Racism is something  that
we do not even want  to  talk  about,  we  outlawed  that.  There  are  many
challenges facing the sports commission.

I am glad that hon members said some of the things here  that  I  say  every
day to the officials. The CEO,  head  of  the  department  and  director  of
facilities are all sitting there together with Rita,  who  was  involved  in
the RDP projects that we had, and then there is the policy  person  and  the
legal buff, Gideon Boshof. So  all  of  them  are  here.  Whenever  I  raise
issues, they know where it comes from.

To the hon Madlala I want to say that transformation is indeed slow, but  we
are putting systems in place to get it moving.

Most members mentioned that indigenous games are doing very well. I want  to
ask members to encourage their provinces to do something. What  Prince  Zulu
has said is quite good, and we should follow up on some of the  things  that
he has raised, like competitions between provinces in indigenous games.

Every member said  something  about  school  sport.  It  is  something  that
worries a lot of us. We are putting a lot  of  effort  into  getting  school
sport up and running.  We  are  also  appealing  to  teachers,  coaches  and
parents to take an interest in school sport. I know  some  of  us  here  are
parents, but we hardly go to our children's  games.  We  need  to  encourage
people to attend them.
My daughter barred me from  attending  matches.  She  plays  netball  and  I
embarrassed her. I ran alongside the court, screaming.  I  got  so  involved
that my daughter said: ``Never  again.''  [Laughter.]  Therefore  I  do  not
attend matches any more. I embarrass them when I go to these things.

We are dealing with the issue of the ASA. I hope that we  will  get  to  the
bottom of it. Every day all of us in Government talk about clean  governance
and clean administration. Currently, with the  documentation  that  we  have
got, we really are getting somewhere to finalise the whole thing.

I am quite worried about the issue of Model C schools and soccer.  Kids  are
mostly directed towards just rugby and cricket and not  given  a  choice  to
play soccer too. It is something that we need to discuss with  the  Minister
of Education to involve the teacher  unions.  Ussasa  is  very  critical  in
this.

I think the criterion for PSL clubs in KwaZulu-Natal is quite simple.  If  a
club finishes last, it is out. That is the way that it is done.  It  is  not
because they are from KwaZulu-Natal, it is because they could not  make  it.
Clubs facing that right now are the African Wanderers and  Manning  Rangers.
At some stage I thought Punja  Cele  Cele  counted  among  these,  but  they
recovered and are playing well. I hope we are getting somewhere.

Sis Hope Malgas is Sis Hope to me. She has been involved in nonracial  sport
for a very long time. We are streamlining the department  and  I  hope  that
will quell the fears of officials.

We have an admirable programme that gives free sports equipment  to  schools
and clubs. Hon members should feel free to contact us. We give  free  soccer
and netball kits to all schools, irrespective of where they are. We  request
members to be vigilant, look at those areas and help us.  The  programme  is
running for the second year. We give kits to  all  areas  and  we  need  hon
members' assistance in that.

Peddie in the Eastern Cape is one of the nodes  which  will  receive  sports
facilities as part of our poverty relief programme. We will be  launching  a
sport and recreation programme in Peddie in August.

I am worried about women in sport. More effort should go into that. We  need
to push for more women and girls to participate in sport.

From the Department's side, I  cannot  complain  much  about  funding.  Once
again I want to assure hon members that we will look into matters if we  are
approached.

Mr Van Niekerk spoke well, and I am not going  to  enter  into  debate  with
him. He spoke very well. Herschelle Gibbs was  given  a  suspended  sentence
last  night.  The  sentence  is  mostly  about  ensuring  that  he  goes  to
counselling and mentoring, as the hon member has rightly pointed out.

We have set aside opportunities for smaller sports codes. We have set  aside
some money for this. Most of them do not get sponsorships  because  they  do
not have air time. They do not appear on television as much  as  the  bigger
codes. We have a programme to deal with that, which will help them.

I have tried to run through a lot  of  things  that  I  heard.  The  hon  Mr
Colemann is quite right about table tennis. Sometimes I  wonder  whether  we
should send 10 people out or rather get the team to come and play  here.  It
is something that the head of the department  should  look  at.  Fortunately
the assistant policy director is here to look at some of those things.

The ministerial task team is doing good work. I hope that it will go to  the
provinces and involve more and more of our stakeholders.

It is true that we should not sit back and do nothing  about  the  issue  of
Ellis Park. I have mentioned Ellis Park several times  in  my  speeches.  Mr
Mkhaliphi spoke about fair play. I like his approach to  fair  play,  it  is
exactly the kind of approach that we have.

Ntate Mfebe spoke about sport in the Free State, where they are doing  quite
well. The hon member covered most of what they are doing. I  am  happy  with
that, especially with the link they have with the Flemish  government.  This
is part of an agreement that we have.

We have very good agreements with other countries like  China.  We  will  be
signing an agreement with China in August and will  exchange  resources  and
expertise. The same goes for Cuba. At present  we  have  three  students  in
Cuba and will be sending three more for training. In this way we  get  quite
a lot of good expertise and exchange.

Ma Nkuna referred to racism. She reminded me of a  document  addressing  the
demon of racism. I think every member of the ANC has read it  and  it  would
be good reading for the other parties too. Please feel free to read  it.  It
will help the hon Mrs Witbooi. [Laughter.] I have  mentioned  Ussasa.  Their
motto is: A child in sport is a child out of court.

Lastly, the issue of the broadcasting of national events is another area  of
concern. I am going  to  have  a  meeting  this  afternoon  with  the  three
broadcasters to deal with that, because all of us cannot have decoders,  and
most of our people cannot have access to decoders and satellite dishes.  The
SABC, e-tv and M-Net have a meeting  with  me  this  afternoon  to  try  and
resolve some of these areas so that people can have access to these sports.

I would like to thank the Select Committee on  Education  in  the  NCOP,  in
particular  the  chairperson,  Mr  David  Kgware,  for   his   support   and
commitment. We have  always  had  this  kind  of  a  relationship  with  the
standing committee, the SA Sports Commission and the members of Minmec,  all
the MECs. Professor Denver Hendricks, who is the head of my department,  has
also been a top sportsperson. He is looking  forward  to  going  to  Peddie,
because he at one time slept in a cell in Peddie, because he did not have  a
place to sleep. He is one of the top players we have had.

This year is the year of volunteers.  That  hon  member  is  quite  correct,
volunteers are critical to sport.

Lastly, tomorrow, as hon members are aware, the replay of the Kaiser  Chiefs
versus Pirates game is going to take place at the FNB  Stadium.  Santos  and
Sundowns are also playing there tomorrow. It is a  big  game,  and  I  would
urge members to come to the game. It will help. Buy tickets and come to  the
game. We wish all the teams that will be playing there tomorrow  very  well.
We hope the best team will win.

I have mentioned a lot  of  things.  Regarding  Ellis  Park,  I  hope  Judge
Bernard Ngoepe will come up  with  very  good  recommendations  on  avoiding
anything like what happened at Ellis Park happening in South Africa again.

Lastly, to our sportspeople out there, we wish them the  best  for  whatever
they are doing. We really see them as role models, and  they  should  behave
as such. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 12:53.
