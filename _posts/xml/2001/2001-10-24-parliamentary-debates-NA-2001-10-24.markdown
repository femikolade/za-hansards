                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr B A RADEBE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the Israeli government has defied the call by the United
       States government to withdraw its security forces from Palestinian
       areas;


  (2) further notes that the South African Government has added its voice
       in calling for the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli troops in
       Palestinian areas;


  (3) believes that the continued presence of Israeli forces in Palestine
       and the occupied territories only fuels anger, resentment and
       violence and hampers initiatives to work for lasting peace in the
       Middle East region;


  (4) strongly condemns the presence of the Israeli forces in Palestine and
       the occupied territories; and


  (5) joins the South African Government in calling for the immediate
       withdrawal of the Israeli forces from Palestine and the occupied
       territories.
[Applause.]

Mr R S NTULI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the fascinating ANC document about an ``ultra-left tendency''
       in Cosatu and the SACP that accuses the ``ultra-left clique'' of de-
       linking labour and the ruling party so as to wage a ``pure class
       struggle'';


  (2) expresses its amazement at the accusation that the Unions are at the
       same time ``right-wing'' because, like the DA, they have criticised
       the Government's quiet diplomacy in Zimbabwe, and urged the release
       of the Medical Research Council report on Aids; and


  (3) therefore calls on the ANC to -


       (a)  realise that it is not the sole repository of political wisdom;
           and


       (b)  respect and not pay lip service to multi-party democracy.

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with sadness that a motorist was shot and killed in Benoni on
       Saturday, 20 October 2001, in an alleged incident of road rage;


  (2) conveys its condolences and sympathies to the family of the victim;
       and


  (3) condemns such behaviour and urges motorists to be tolerant when on
       the road.

Dr A N LUTHULI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) has started to disarm as a
       contribution to the peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ireland;


  (2) further notes statements by Gerry Adams, leader of the Sinn Fein,
       that his party and the people of Ireland were inspired by the South
       African model for peaceful transition;


  (3) believes that the decision to disarm by the IRA represents a
       milestone in the achievement of peace, democracy and national self-
       determination for the people of Ireland; and


  (4) welcomes the decision by the Irish Republican Army to decommission
       its armaments.

Mnr F BEUKMAN: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die Minister van Binnelandse Sake, dr Buthelezi, 'n verklaring
           van 64 paragrawe uitgereik het waarin hy aandui dat die
           werksverhouding tussen hom en sy Direkteur-generaal, mnr Billy
           Masetlha, onherstelbaar verbrokkel het;


       (b)  die direkteur-generaal by verskeie geleenthede nie die opdragte
           van die Minister uitgevoer het nie;


       (c)  die direkteur-generaal nie oor 'n geldige en wettige
           dienskontrak beskik nie;


       (d)  die huidige krisis die werksvermoë van die departement ernstig
           kniehalter; en
       (e)  die beginsel erken word dat 'n minister van 'n staatsdepartement
           bygestaan word deur 'n rekenpligtige beampte in wie hy of sy
           vertroue het; en


  (2) 'n beroep doen op president Mbeki om persoonlik in te gryp en inhoud
       aan dié beginsel te gee.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr F BEUKMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Minister of Home Affairs, Dr Buthelezi, has issued a 64-
           paragraph statement in which he indicates that the working
           relationship between him and his Director-General, Mr Billy
           Masetlha, has broken down irreparably;


       (b)  the Director-General has, on various occasions, not carried out
           the instructions of the Minister;


       (c)  the Director-General does not have a valid and legal employment
           contract;


       (d)  the current crisis is seriously hampering the department's
           ability to work; and


       (e)  it is a recognised principle that a Minister of a state
           department is assisted by an accounting officer in whom he or
           she has confidence; and


  (2) appeals to President Mbeki to intervene personally and give content
       to this principle.]

Ms A VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) unequivocally condemns the occurrence of xenophobia as manifested in
       attacks against people of Zimbabwean descent in Zandspruit, Gauteng;


  (2) acknowledges this as a clear indication of the loss of trust of the
       community in the Government's ability to deal effectively with the
       problem of illegal immigrants;


  (3) notes that the breakdown of trust between the Minister of Home
       Affairs and the Director-General of the Department of Home Affairs is
       contributing to the department's inability to deal with one of its
       most basic responsibilities, namely, immigration;


  (4) calls on President Mbeki to address the collapse of good governance
       in the Department of Home Affairs as a matter of urgency, as he is
       responsible for the appointment of both the Minister and the director-
       general, and intervention at this highest level is required urgently;
       and


  (5) further calls on all South Africans to temper their frustration with
       Government's inability, and to exhibit tolerance and respect in the
       spirit of a united and democratic South Africa.

Ms N E NGALEKA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern the reports that the goals set by the Earth Summit
       in Rio have not been met;
  (2) believes that the planned Earth Summit which will take place in
       Johannesburg next month must embody a vision which will inspire and
       mobilise people around the world on environmental issues and that
       this vision must be backed up by a clear implementation strategy with
       time frames; and


  (3) calls on all representatives of countries to this summit to ensure
       that practical steps are taken to ensure that the resolutions of this
       forthcoming conference are implemented. [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the PAC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the PAC is deeply concerned about lawlessness in our
       country and attacks on other Africans from outside this country;
  (2) believes that all African people who are here legally must be
       protected against criminal acts, and that immigrants who enter this
       country unlawfully must be deported, but not be harassed in any way;


  (3) holds that the African Union, the Pan African Parliament and the
       whole question of African unity will be a farce if Africans are
       harassed in Africa worse than they are harassed in Europe or America;


  (4) therefore condemns the recent burning of shelters allegedly belonging
       to Africans from Zimbabwe; and


  (5) appeals to the Government to make the ``rule of law'' in this country
       not a mere political slogan, but a meaningful legal principle to be
       strictly observed.

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:
  That the House -


  (1) takes note of the stranglehold which the ``mother of the nation'' has
       over the ANC-controlled Government; and


  (2) notes that her party does not discipline members who -


       (a)  embarrass the President at official functions;


       (b)  build up arrear service accounts with their local authorities
           and therefore lead the nonpayment culture;


       (c)  completely ignore the Masakhane pledge which Members of
           Parliament signed wherein they undertook to pay local authority
           accounts; and


       (d)  seemingly allow the illegal sale of liquor from properties which
           they manage.

Mr S A MSHUDULU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a title deed handover ceremony to the Sibonelo community in
           Elandshoek, Mpumalanga, was held on 6 October 2001; and


       (b)  the MEC for Housing and Land Administration, the hon Gininda,
           handed over 200 hectares of land to settle 116 rural farm
           workers;


  (2) believes that this ceremony reflects the ANC-led Government's
       commitment to making land available to the poor and the previously
       disadvantaged communities including rural farm workers; and
  (3) congratulates the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs on her
       commitment to land reform programmes.

Mr S B FARROW: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  our roads are badly maintained owing to a lack of funds;


       (b)  over 1 000 km of fencing along national roads has been stolen,
           increasing the hazard of animals on these roads; and


       (c)  the state has an obligation with respect to public safety on
           roads arising from negligent administration;


  (2) also takes note of the Arrive Alive campaign plans and welcomes all
       measures taken to reduce road deaths; and


  (3) recognises the fact that until our roads are upgraded and properly
       maintained -


       (a)  the Arrive Alive campaign will not achieve its goals; and


       (b)  the state will face financial claims as a result of deaths due
           to bad roads.

Mrs I MARS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the nine provinces for improved financial management as
       reported in the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review;
  (2) applauds the decision by the Minister of Finance to protect the level
       of social grants vis-à-vis the inflation rate;


  (3) notes that due to the HIV/Aids pandemic, social grants support an
       ever increasing number of family members, particularly orphans; and


  (4) pleads that the matter of increased assistance to pensioners be
       prioritised.

Ms H F MALEBANA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Gold Fields has offered Africa Rainbow Minerals (ARM)-Harmony a
           joint venture in an exclusive option to negotiate for two of its
           Free State mines; and
       (b)  this offer significantly boosts ARM-Harmony joint venture
           chances of securing Anglo-Gold's Free State assets;


  (2) believes that this move contributes positively in the strengthening
       of black economic empowerment and the transformation of the mining
       sector; and


  (3) welcomes the offer made by Gold Fields.

[Applause.]

Mnr J W LE ROUX: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)  'n derde van die riviermondings in Suid-Afrika in 'n swak
           toestand verkeer weens onoordeelkundige ontwikkeling en swak
           bestuur;


       (b)  die 270 riviermondings in Suid-Afrika ekonomies sowel as
           ekologies van die uiterste belang is; en


       (c)  verdere navorsing dringend noodsaaklik is;


  (2) meen dat -


       (a)  die Departement van Omgewingsake en Toerisme onmiddellik aandag
           aan hierdie probleem moet gee; en


       (b)  sodanige aandag ook uitgebrei moet word om die besoedeling van
           riviere in die algemeen te bekamp; en


  (3) 'n beroep doen op die Minister om voorkomend op te tree en nie soos
       in die meeste ANC-beheerde departemente slegs skadebeheer toe te pas
       nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J W LE ROUX: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  one third of South Africa's river mouths are in a bad state
           because of injudicious development and poor management;


       (b)  South Africa's 270 river mouths are, economically as well as
           ecologically, of the utmost importance; and


       (c)  further research is urgently needed;


  (2) is of the opinion that -


       (a)  the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism should pay
           immediate attention to this problem; and


       (b)  such attention should also be extended to combat the pollution
           of rivers in general; and


  (3) appeals to the Minister to introduce preventative measures and by not
       merely to implement damage control as is the case in most ANC-
       controlled departments.]

Mr D G MKONO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the judgment handed down by the Cape High Court in favour of
       Fair Cape Property Developers for losses incurred as a result of
       state officials' negligence;
  (2) notes that this ruling is a milestone in a long-running battle
       between Fair Cape and the provincial government;


  (3) further notes that this precedent-setting case should serve as a wake-
       up call for the Government to observe the constitutional principle of
       accountability;


  (4) calls on all Government departments to improve service delivery or
       face the threat of falling foul of the civil litigation implications
       of this ruling; and


  (5) recognises that the Government is appointed by the people to serve
       the people, and that it is totally unacceptable that citizens should
       have to turn to the courts for relief from its bungling.

Mr M S BOOI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a group of parents whose children died in the Israel/Palestine
           conflict arrived in South Africa;


       (b)  this group is representative of parents who lost loved ones on
           both sides of the conflicting parties; and


       (c)  in its quest to prevent further suffering and loss of life,
           particularly by children, this group has come to seek advice
           from former President Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond
           Tutu;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  this move represents the support for and confidence the
           international community has in our peaceful model for change;
           and
       (b)  what South Africa achieved through negotiations serves as an
           inspiration for people in conflict situations throughout the
           world; and


  (3) expresses the hope that more parents and ordinary people in both
       Palestine and Israel will follow this thoughtful and humane approach
       to conflict resolution.

The House adjourned at 16:05.

     Report to be considered.

6.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs on Status of
     Employment Contract of Director-General: Home Affairs, dated 23 October
     2001:


         The Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs has learnt through several
         media reports that the Director-General of Home Affairs did not
         sign his employment contract. This prima facie impression
         concerned the Committee and as part of our oversight duty a letter
         was sent to the Director-General on 29 August 2001, wherein he was
         asked to explain his position in writing to the Committee.


         He responded by explaining that as Cabinet extended his contract
         as Head of the Department of Home Affairs, it was not necessary
         for him to sign an employment contract different from the one that
         he signed when he was appointed.
         He further explained that by means of a letter to the Department
         of Public Service and Administration, he accepted the decision of
         Cabinet to extend his employment contract on the same terms and
         conditions as stipulated in his original employment contract. Mr
         Masetlha also provided us with a copy of an undated letter that
         was sent to him from Mr M R Ramaite, Director-General of Public
         Service and Administration. In this letter Mr Ramaite informs Mr
         Masetlha that Cabinet has approved the extension of his contract
         for 12 months and also that the same conditions of service as were
         applicable during his first term of office would apply.


         Mr Ramaite also advised Mr Masetlha to enter into a new
         performance agreement with his executing authority.


         The ANC was of the opinion that the letters from Mr Masetlha
         cleared up the questions regarding the status of his employment
         contract. We informed him accordingly but, for the sake of our
         records, requested a dated copy of the above-mentioned letter from
         Mr Ramaite.


         After the above-mentioned events, we received a letter,
         accompanied by two legal opinions, from Dr Buthelezi, the
         Honourable Minister of Home Affairs, wherein he informed us that
         both Senior Counsel opinions indicate that Mr Masetlha does not
         have the type of contract legally required to establish and
         maintain an employment relationship as Head of the Department.


         The matter of Mr Masetlha's contract was thus again discussed at a
         Committee meeting on Tuesday, 25 September 2001. The New NP moved
         that a subcommittee should be established to investigate the
         issue. The Chairperson overruled this opinion and explained that
         it would be better to refer the matter to the Public Service
         Commission to investigate.


         The Committee recommends that the Public Service Commission be
         requested to investigate the issue as they are the proper
         authority with the necessary capacity and personnel to investigate
         the issue.

7.    Fifth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, dated 3
     October 2001:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered and
     examined various Reports of the Auditor-General on the Multiparty
     Negotiation Process: Conference Facilities at World Trade Centre (see
     Schedule in [RP 132-99], p 15), and certain papers referred to it,
     reports as follows:


     A.     Multiparty negotiation process: Conference facilities at World
         Trade Centre (WTC)
         (Par 3.1.1, page 2 & par 3.2, page 4) [RP 132-99]


         1. The non-compliance with procurement and other regulations for
              the leasing of conference facilities at the WTC has been a
              matter under examination by the Committee over a number of
              years. Since 1993 the Auditor-General has been reporting on
              the matter, and in 1995 he reported that, owing to the
              unavailability of supporting vouchers and the absence of a
              written agreement, as well as the inability of the supplier
              and the Department to furnish satisfactory explanations and/or
              alternative audit evidence, he could not express an opinion on
              the reasonableness of the expenditure totalling R66 227 648.
              If ex post facto approval from the State Tender Board could
              not be obtained, the expenditure would be regarded as
              unauthorised.


         2. In May 1995 the Committee heard evidence from the former
              Director-General and other officials. The Committee noted that
              time constraints placed on the Department to activate the
              multiparty conference as soon as possible, had complicated the
              normal tendering process and, to some degree, the normal
              entering into of a detailed lease agreement.


              However, it was with concern that the Committee learned that
              only verbal agreements had been entered into between the
              responsible Chief Director and the management of the WTC.


         3. In response to a recommendation by the Committee, the Minister
              of Constitutional Development recommended in 1998 that the
              matter be referred to the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) for
              investigation and adjudication of justifiable civil disputes
              emanating from such an investigation.


         4. In February 2000, the Committee heard evidence from the SIU,
              during which it was reported that they could not proceed with
              the matter, as their legal advisers were of the opinion that
              the claim had prescribed. However, the SIU also concluded that
              amounts paid by the Department for the leasing of the WTC were
              reasonable and fair, based on oral and documentary evidence
              collected (mainly related to unavailability of comparable
              facilities, the necessity for alterations, owing to certain
              political parties joining at later stages of the negotiation
              process, as well as comparisons with later costs for
              accommodation of the Transitional Executive Council).


              Notwithstanding the above, the SIU concluded that, had the
              Department taken action sooner, it would have been entitled to
              a claim based on proper tender procedures not being followed,
              although the WTC would have had a counter-claim for services
              rendered to an equal amount, if not more.


              This clearly demonstrates to the Committee the need for proper
              procurement practices, and that in this case the least the
              responsible departmental official and the Director-General
              should have ensured, was that some form of written agreement
              should have been entered into to prevent later disputes and
              uncertainties.


              The Committee reiterates its concern, expressed at all its
              previous hearings on this matter, at the failure of the former
              financial official and the former Director-General to comply
              with applicable requirements and prescripts to enter into a
              written agreement, clearly failing to comply with requirements
              of proper financial control and management.


              The Committee is of the view that the reasons of exceptional
              circumstances offered by the relevant officials as
              justification for departure from applicable procedures were
              not sufficiently compelling to convince the Committee that
              that departure was justifiable. This disregard for procedures
              has resulted in the legislature being confronted with an
              embarrassing and unresolved state of affairs, to which it must
              respond. The Committee was further concerned that the former
              Director-General took no initiative or active steps to ensure
              that disciplinary action, where appropriate, was taken against
              the Chief Director at the time.
         5. The Auditor-General, in the meanwhile, confirmed the amount of
              R66 227 648 as unauthorised in terms of section 33(1)(c) and
              (d) of the Exchequer Act. The Parliamentary Law Advisers were
              requested to indicate whether any claim by the Department
              against the WTC could be substantiated, in view of the
              Prescription Act. In August 2001, they confirmed that the
              claim had prescribed.


              The Committee notes with concern that, despite the efforts of
              all the role-players concerned in investigating this matter to
              obtain information to ascertain the full amount of the
              possible claim, the frustration of these efforts contributed
              to the time lag that resulted in the eventual prescription.


         6. The Committee finds itself in an insufferable and unacceptable
              position: A saga of inefficiency and procrastination that may
              have caused losses to the State and the taxpayer, confronts
              the legislature.  Although it cannot be proved and, given that
              the claim had prescribed, it would not be cost-effective to
              calculate the exact amount, the Committee is in a position
              where the extent of wasteful expenditure or losses cannot be
              accurately ascertained. The extent to which the State received
              full value for the expenditure of R66 227 648 therefore
              remains unclear.


         7. With respect to the future, the Committee is encouraged by the
              new control framework introduced by the PFMA, which provides
              the Committee with some assurance that similar incidents will
              be limited, and, should they occur, they will be covered by a
              number of the provisions of that Act. The PFMA requires
              accounting officers to ensure cost-effective and competitive
              procurement practices, as well as being responsible for the
              efficient, effective, economical and transparent use of the
              resources of the Department. In addition, the accounting
              officer is responsible for taking appropriate steps to prevent
              irregular and wasteful expenditure, which the WTC expenditure
              clearly seemed to have been. Accounting officers are now also
              responsible, upon the discovery of any irregular or wasteful
              expenditure, for taking effective and appropriate disciplinary
              steps against responsible officials.


              The Committee is not prepared to condone shoddy management in
              future, and will insist that relevant measures be applied and
              that the law be applied to protect the public purse. In
              addition, it expects accounting officers as custodians of
              public funds to be pro-active in not only preventing such
              incidents, but also immediately acting upon the discovery of
              such instances.


         8. It is only in view of the legal position indicated above that
              the Committee recommends that the expenditure be validated and
              written off in terms of the relevant legislation.


              In the light of the SIU's findings and that of the
              Parliamentary Law Advisers, the Committee is reluctantly
              compelled to ask Parliament to bring this matter to a close by
              recommending authorisation of this substantial amount, as
              enumerated. However, the Committee wants to highlight the
              following issues, so that other government departments may
              draw lessons from them:


              (a) Verbal agreements are susceptible to manipulation. All
                  agreements/contracts must be in writing and duly signed.


              (b) No expenditure should be permitted without supporting
                  vouchers.


              (c) Directors-General must take timeous disciplinary action
                  against subordinates where proper procurement practices
                  are not followed. Inefficiency and malpractices resulting
                  in wasteful expenditure causing losses to the State are
                  punishable in terms of the PFMA.


     B.     Unauthorised expenditure of R217 215,05
         (Par 3.1.2(c), page 4) [RP 132-99]


         The Committee took note of the finding of an independent
         consultant, appointed by the Director-General to investigate the
         above-mentioned amount, that no official could be held responsible
         for the unauthorised expenditure relating to the extension of a
         tender for consultancy services for RDP projects, resulting in the
         contract having been exceeded by the aforementioned amount. The
         Committee also took note that the Auditor-General concurred with
         the conclusions of the aforementioned investigation by the
         independent consultant.


         The Committee therefore recommends that the unauthorised
         expenditure of R217 215,05 be approved by Parliament.


     Report to be considered.

8.    Sixth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, dated 3
     October 2001:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having heard and considered
     evidence on the Report of the Auditor-General on the findings
     identified during an audit of the Salary Bill at national and
     provincial departments [RP 163-2000] (the Salary Bill), reports as
     follows:


     A.     Background


         An audit on the Salary Bill to identify possible fictitious
         beneficiaries, who had been paid salaries by the government, was
         conducted at the undermentioned national departments and
         provincial administrations:


         1. National departments


              Correctional Services
              Justice
              South African Police Service


         2. Provincial administrations


              Eastern Cape
              Gauteng
              KwaZulu-Natal
              Mpumalanga
              Northern Province
              North West


     B.     Findings


         1.  The National Treasury indicated that it is responsible for
              ensuring that the Personnel and Salary System (PERSAL) is
              properly maintained, and  it also provides some operational
              training. It is, however, the responsibility of the various
              departments to keep PERSAL updated. The Treasury assured the
              Committee that the PERSAL section has regular workshops and is
              currently concentrating on the provinces to make them aware of
              the functions and exception reports available on PERSAL.


              The Committee therefore recommends that the National Treasury:


              (a) ensure that departments understand the value of the
                  provided management information, that the system is used
                  optimally and that all departments are informed of all
                  available exception reports on PERSAL as well as of the
                  relevance thereof to user departments;


              (b) stress the need to follow up exception reports as well as
                  the responsibility of accounting officers in this regard;


              (c) through the State Information Technology Agency (SITA),
                  monitor the exceptions, and in instances where
                  departments did not take action, follow these up with the
                  accounting officers; and


              (d) extend its workshops regarding PERSAL to also include all
                  provinces.


         2. It also came to the attention of the Committee that significant
              progress has been made in rectifying certain problems
              identified in the Report of the Auditor-General:


              (a) The National Treasury indicated that they have installed
                  the necessary software to allow them to check for
                  duplicate/multiple appointments between mainframes. A
                  facility has also been created whereby a person now
                  retains his or her PERSAL number, even if he or she moves
                  between departments.


                  Although the National Treasury has taken some rectifying
                  steps, the Committee recommends that it monitor multiple
                  appointments to ensure that such appointments do not take
                  place in future.


              (b) The Committee is satisfied with the progress made by the
                  National Treasury in decreasing the number of computer-
                  generated and invalid identity numbers. It was brought to
                  the attention of the departments that this type of ID
                  numbers should be limited and should not be standard
                  practice. It is purely by exception that a person should
                  get such an ID number, rather than an ID number issued by
                  the Department of Home Affairs.


                  The Committee recommends that the National Treasury
                  monitor computer-generated ID numbers to ensure that
                  accounting officers take action to reduce such cases, and
                  computer-generated ID numbers only be applicable to non-
                  RSA citizens.


              (c) Furthermore, the Department of Public Service and
                  Administration (the DPSA) indicated that the problem
                  regarding staff members over the age of 65 that are still
                  employed, mainly occurs in the Eastern Cape, where the
                  former Ciskei and Transkei kept poor records, to the
                  extent that there were disputes about dates of
                  appointment. The DPSA indicated that the matter would be
                  resolved soon, and the Committee is encouraged by the
                  fact that an instruction to terminate services has been
                  issued in certain cases.


                  Nevertheless, the Committee recommends that the DPSA
                  follow up its instruction to terminate the services of
                  permanent staff members over the age of 65, and report
                  back to the Committee by 30 November 2001.


         3. The Committee further noted the following:


              (a) Payments to deceased staff members and salary payments are
                  not cancelled timeously after termination of service, due
                  to a lack of interface between PERSAL data, data on
                  deceased persons according to the Department of Home
                  Affairs and the Government Employees' Pension Fund
                  (GEPF).


                  The Committee therefore recommends that the National
                  Treasury complete the interface of both the Department of
                  Home Affairs and the GEPF, include it as a standard
                  exception report on PERSAL, and inform all accounting
                  officers of the availability thereof.


              (b) State guarantees of staff members who had resigned, were
                  not always redeemed or recovered. The Committee noted the
                  corrective steps taken by the DPSA - a policy decision
                  has been taken to stop this practice, so as to move
                  towards a situation where pension fund accounts of
                  employees can be used for this purpose.


                  The Committee recommends that the DPSA implement the
                  policy regarding state guarantees wherever the pension
                  funds of employees can be used for this purpose. The DPSA
                  must also ensure that no further state guarantees are
                  issued.


              (c) Slow progress has been made with regard to the
                  implementation of the recommendations of the White
                  Commission. Although the DPSA indicated that, at this
                  stage, the issue is a legal matter on which they need to
                  be advised, the Committee recommends that the DPSA report
                  back by 30 November 2001 regarding the implementation of
                  the recommendations of the White Commission.


     Report to be considered.
