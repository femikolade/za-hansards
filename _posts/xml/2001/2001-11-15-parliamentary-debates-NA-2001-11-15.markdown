                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr M T GONIWE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the DP's walkout during the briefing session by the agencies
       investigating the arms deal;
  (2) believes that -


       (a)  the walkout by the DP constitutes a deliberate affront to the
           integrity of the investigation and the credibility of the
           investigating agencies; and


       (b)  this ill-considered act displays the resolve of the DP to stop
           at nothing in its misguided agenda of working tirelessly and
           ruthlessly to discredit the government, the breakdown of the
           rule of law and portraying South Africa in a bad light both here
           at home and abroad; and


  (3) calls on all South Africans to see the DP for what it is - a
       negative, confused minority sect of yesterday men and women with
       nothing to offer the people of this country.

[Applause.]

Mr A J BOTHA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the N1 highway between Johannesburg and Cape Town was closed
           yesterday for almost four hours because of smoke from tyres that
           were burnt next to the road;


       (b)  this illegal act by the community of Edenburg was in protest
           over the lack of delivery by the ANC-led municipality of
           Kopanong in the Free State; and


       (c)  the ANC Government is failing in its Batho Pele campaign in
           rural communities and these communities are now reverting to
           civil disobedience in order to attract attention to their
           plight;


  (2) calls on the ANC Government to heed their calls for better delivery;
       and


  (3) requests the leadership of the ANC to get actively involved in
       attending to the needs of rural communities.

Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with deep sympathy the death of Mr Josiah Nkosi, the managing
       director of Makhosi Construction, who is yet another victim of car
       hijacking on his doorstep;


  (2) further notes that ...

[Interjections.] Will you keep quiet, please?


       further notes that this civil engineer, builder and mathematician
       who was the first such black graduate of the University of the
       Witwatersrand back in 1972, will be sorely missed in the profession;


  (3) realises that this incident took place in full sight of the victim's
       daughter who went out after hearing an altercation and whose arrival
       prevented the car from being stolen;


  (4) truly prays that the victim's family and next of kin will heal with
       time after this sudden loss; and


  (5) requests the members of the SAPS to apprehend the criminals and more
       so to ensure the safety of the child who witnessed this sinister act.

sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the President of the Republic of South Africa, hon Thabo
       Mbeki, has urged elected representatives to listen to what the people
       have to say because they are an important partner in accelerating
       delivery;


  (2) believes that the statement made by the President is in line with the
       ANC-led Government's approach of involving people in the process of
       change;


  (3) welcomes the statement made by the President, hon Thabo Mbeki; and


  (4) urges all members of Parliament to implement this clarion call during
       their constituency work.

[Applause.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the
next sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the replacement of certain members of the SAA board;


  (2) hopes that this move will also be the dawn of an era of a more
       transparent policy on remuneration packages at SAA and a commitment
       to corporate governance; and
  (3) calls on the Minister to disclose immediately the remuneration
       packages of newly appointed members of the SAA board, thereby
       regaining the credibility of and trust in the SAA.

       countries to have access to medicines;

       calling for the phasing out of export subsidies;

       context of economic empowerment and job creation; and

       more equal and just international trade system, that does not
       relegate the developing countries to perpetual poverty.

[Applause.]

Miss M N MAGAZI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:

  (1) notes that Deputy President Jacob Zuma called on the people of South
       Africa to go back to the philosophy of ``any child is my child'' in
       order to curb child abuse and child rape;


  (2) believes that this philosophy is in line with the spirit of ubuntu
       which encourages values of care, sacrifice and solidarity;


  (3) reiterates the Deputy President's call for the people of South Africa
       to embrace the philosophy of ``every child is my child''; and


  (4) works towards a secure and caring environment which upholds the
       rights of children and especially the girl child.

[Applause.]

  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the University of Transkei is reported to have managed to drag
           itself back from the brink of closure;
       (b)  the interim administrator, a Prof Nicky Morgan, attributed
           Unitra's success to meticulous planning, student debt recovery
           and belt-tightening in every aspect of its operations;


       (c)  this university is located in one of the poorest areas in the
           country but managed to collect R19 million in fees this year;
           and


       (d)  the Eastern Cape has contributed enormously to the country's
           economic growth and good governance through education;


     (2)    congratulates the university on its speedy financial recovery
         and Prof Morgan on his sterling work; and


     (3)    calls upon the Minister of Education to ensure that Prof
         Morgan's successor is someone with suitable qualifications, who
         will be able to carry on with the good work already achieved.

[Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mev die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek tydens
die volgende sitting sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis kennis neem dat -


  (1) die teruggryp na die uitgediende begrippe van ``verlig'' en
       ``verkramp'' deur die leier van die Nuwe NP, om sy huidige optrede en
       toenadering tot die ANC te regverdig, verdag en jammer is;


  (2) die opsie van mnr Van Schalkwyk om hom en die Nuwe NP by die ANC te
       voeg, met verlig en verkramp absoluut niks te make het nie;


  (3) die VF meen dat persoonlikheidsbotsings en onderliggende verskille
       tussen die Nuwe NP en die DP binne die DA, kiesers by 'n
       doodloopstraat gebring het;


  (4) die partye kiesers voor 'n hopelose keuse tussen die Nuwe NP se
       oneervolle abdikasie of die DA se sinlose konfrontasie plaas; en


     5) die VF glo egter daar is 'n alternatief en uitkoms hieruit en dat
        die oplossing tydens die VF se nasionale kongres op 16 en 17
        November op die tafel geplaas word.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that at the next
sitting I shall move:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) the leader of the New NP's reversion to the obsolete concepts of
       ``verlig'' and ``verkramp'' in order to justify his current actions
       and approach towards the ANC is suspect and unfortunate;


  (2) Mr Van Schalkwyk's option to range himself and the New NP on the side
       of the ANC has absolutely nothing to do with ``verlig'' and
       ``verkramp'';


  (3) the FF believes that personality clashes and underlying differences
       within the DA between the New NP and the DP have brought voters to a
       cul-de-sac;


  (4) the parties have placed voters before a hopeless choice between the
       New NP's dishonourable abdication and the DP's senseless
       confrontation; and


  (5) the FF, however, believes that there is an alternative and a way out
       of this and that the solution will be tabled at the FF's national
       congress on 16 and 17 November.]

Mr G G OLIPHANT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a sangoma and her two accomplices have been sentenced to life
           imprisonment for killing her own four-year-old daughter in
           Thohoyandou in 1999;


       (b)  the sangoma used the child's body parts to ``please her
           ancestral spirits'' on the instructions of her handler; and


       (c)  sentencing of the accused comes in the wake of heinous crimes
           against women and girl children;


  (2) commends the police service on their sterling work; and


  (3) welcomes the sentence imposed on the accused as fitting the crime and
       calls on the courts to be firm when dealing with perpetrators of
       violence against children.

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the unprocedural and unprecedented briefing by the Joint
           Investigating Team to Parliament that could create the
           impression that the JIT has formally accounted to Parliament;


       (b)  the confirmation by the Office of the Auditor-General that the
           executive has had a copy of the report and therefore had the
           scope under section 4(6) to add or subtract from the report; and


       (c)  the DA's principled decision not to participate in the
           orchestrated press conference of the ruling party in this
           Chamber; and


  (2) expresses its desire -


       (a)  to debate this matter of public importance as a matter of
           urgency in this House in a formal plenary; and


       (b)  to ensure a thorough and critical engagement with this report
           takes place in Parliament's Standing Committee on Public
           Accounts.

[Applause.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the UN-led coalition of member states in the battle to contain
           terrorism is as important now as ever and that bioterrorism and
           nuclear terrorism require constant vigilance;


       (b)  South Africa as a member country has pledged its support for
           this coalition;


       (c)  in the list of 12 counterterrorism conventions five treaties
           have not been signed by South Africa; and


       (d)  seven treaties require ratification by South Africa, including
           the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of
           Financing of Terrorism; and
  (2) therefore calls on the Minister of Foreign Affairs and any other
       individuals responsible for realising these commitments to do so as
       soon as possible, so that the position of South Africa is unambiguous
       and so that our internal strategies are implemented with clarity and
       commitment.

Rev A D GOOSEN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Coega development project is on track, and this initiative
           is going to have a profound impact on the economy of the country
           as a whole, and on the Eastern Cape in particular;


       (b)  it will be a great initiative in job creation leading to the
           expansion of businesses in the provinces; and


       (c)  it will increase our country's export rate; and


  (2) calls on -


       (a)  businesses and environmentalists to refrain from all negative
           attitudes; and


       (b)  all members in this House and the population at large to support
           the development of Coega, as it will be beneficial to us all.

[Applause.]

Mnr J J NIEMANN: Mev die Speaker, hiermee gee ek kennis dat ek tydens die
volgende sitting sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem daarvan dat al 81 rekenaars uit die kantore van die
       Padongelukkefonds verdwyn het net voor die ondersoek van die SAPD na
       sistematiese korrupsie deur personeellede van die fonds;


  (2) verder kennis neem daarvan dat die Minister van Vervoer by herhaling
       deur die lede van die portefeuljekomitee versoek is om as 'n
       tussentydse maatreël streng stappe te doen om diefstal van dié fonds
       se geld stop te sit;


  (3) sy kommer uitspreek oor die Minister se volgehoue onwilligheid om
       daadwerklik op te tree; en


  (4) aanbeveel dat die administrasie van die fonds onmiddellik
       geprivatiseer word deur die inkoop van 'n erkende ouditeursfirma se
       bestuursvaardigheid.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J J NIEMANN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that at the next
sitting I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that just before the SAPS' investigation into systematic
       corruption by staff members of the Road Accident Fund all 81 of its
       computers disappeared from the fund's offices;


  (2) further notes that the Minister of Transport has been requested
       repeatedly by members of the portfolio committee, as an interim
       measure, to put an end to theft of the fund's money;


  (3) expresses its concern at the Minister's continued unwillingness to
       take decisive action; and


  (4) recommends that the administration of the fund be privatised
       forthwith by buying into a recognised audit firm's management
       capabilities.]

Mr D G MKONO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the sacking of Transnet chairperson Louise Tager by the
       Minister for Public Enterprises;


  (2) further notes that despite vehement denials, it appears that Tager's
       sacking serves the purpose of exonerating senior officials for their
       role in the Andrews saga;


  (3) expresses its concern at the questioning of the Transnet board's lack
       of action in dealing with the Andrews saga, as it amounts to the pot
       calling the kettle black; and


  (4) calls on the Government to take full responsibility for the Coleman
       Andrews saga.

Mr E M SIGWELA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the European Union has pledged R6,5 million to Algeria for
       flood victims;


  (2) believes that this amount is significant in rebuilding infrastructure
       destroyed by these floods and assisting the Algerian people in
       rebuilding their lives; and
  (3) welcomes the pledge made by the European Union.

[Applause.]

   PLEDGE BY USA AND RUSSIA TO REDUCE NUCLEAR ARSENAL AND LIMIT SPREAD OF
                  BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

The ACTING CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the pledge by President George Bush of the United States to
       reduce his country's nuclear arsenal by two thirds over the next 10
       years and the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to try
       to respond in kind;


  (2) further notes the agreement between the US and Russia to cooperate to
       limit the spread of biological, nuclear and chemical weapons; and


  (3) welcomes these positive developments in the promotion of world peace.

Agreed to.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                  (The late Manelisi Honana Fezile Dibongo)

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House notes that-


  (1) the PAC announces the death of one of its Apla veterans, Comrade
       Manelisi Honana Fezile Dibongo, whose guerilla name was Ngamashema;


  (2) Dibongo was gunned down by unknown assailants at Langa township in
       Cape Town on Friday 9 November as he was alighting from his car and
       died on the spot;


  (3) his rich contribution to the struggle, however, will remain in the
       annals of the history of this country eternally;
  (4) Comrade Ngamashema took part in the PAC positive action campaign
       against the apartheid laws which led to the massacre on 21 March;


  (5) Dibongo received his military training in Egypt and Yugoslavia; and


  (6) he will be buried at his home village at Mqanduli in the Eastern Cape
       on 17 November.

The ACTING CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, on a point of
order: I am not sure whether that was a notice of motion or not, because
motions without notice are cleared with other parties' Chief Whips before
being moved in the House.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I do wish that parties among
themselves, and Whips of parties in particular, would clear these matters
beforehand, because these are not issues around which there should be
controversy, especially given the kind of content of that motion without
notice. [Interjections.] So, we will treat it as a notice of motion, as
opposed to a motion without notice.
                   RELEASE OF FOREIGN AID WORKERS CHARGED
                         WITH SPREADING CHRISTIANITY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its thanks that eight foreign aid workers - four Germans,
       two Americans and two Australians - who were arrested in Afghanistan
       in August on a charge of spreading Christianity, were freed early
       today, South African time, and that they are safe and in good
       physical condition;


  (2) congratulates President Bush on achieving this, it being one of the
       four demands he stated in his ultimatum to the Taliban; and


  (3) taking into account that these aid workers stood trial on a charge
       for which they could receive the death penalty, rejects persecution
       on the grounds of faith wherever it still occurs throughout the world
       and re-affirms the principle of religious freedom entrenched in the
       Constitution.

Agreed to.

               STANDING OVER OF MOTION NO 1 ON THE ORDER PAPER

                             (Draft Resolution)

The ACTING CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without
notice:


  That Motion No 1 as printed in my name on the Order Paper stand over
  until before the Fourth Order of the Day.

Agreed to.

                        EDUCATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, this piece of legislation is an
amending Bill which proposes changes to three existing education laws, that
is, the Employment of Educators Act, the Further Education and Training
Act, and the South African Schools Act.

I apologise, at the end of this very exciting session and a day before we
go off to our different parts of South Africa, that these laws are not very
exciting or particularly controversial. I would have liked to have spoken
about the future of higher education instead, but we had to get these Bills
through.

The Bill proposes minor textual changes to the Employment of Educators Act,
and the Further Education and Training Act which, I trust, will be
supported by the House. The Employment of Educators Act contains provisions
for dealing with misconduct and disciplinary actions against teachers, all
aimed at speeding up the processes involved. Given the incidents of
misconduct and unprofessional behaviour which we have been hearing about
recently and which have been uncovered in the media, the need for
streamlined disciplinary processes must be accepted. Now, we can say that
with the amendments that we passed last year and this one, which we hope we
will pass, we have very speedy, effective, just disciplinary action that
can be taken against those who break the most important oath of all, the
oath to look after our young people.

Since amending the Bill in 2000, and implementing these procedures during
the past year, a number of shortcomings have been identified which have
worked against our wish to deal with such matters speedily and fairly. We
are therefore requesting the approval of the House to refine certain
aspects of these procedures, and to remove some of the ambiguities,
including amendments to the forms used to convey a written or final warning
to a teacher. By the way, our systems of labour relations are extremely
complex and difficult when it comes to disciplinary action. Regrettably,
they are too difficult and we are told that, at least in the area of
teaching, we must simplify them.

The amendment to the Further Education and Training Act deals with the
provision of loans and overdrafts to further education and training
institutions. We have experienced some problems regarding debts which are
incurred by these institutions, for which the state may be considered
responsible. However, in terms of the new Bill, only the MEC for education
in the province will be empowered to approve a loan or overdraft to an
institution, and without such approval neither the state nor the
institution will be liable for that debt.

This will send a nice cautionary message to lending institutions. The
colleges, in future, will be obliged to work within their budgets, except
for major or unanticipated expenses where the MEC might have reasons to
approve a loan or overdraft. This will ensure that the fiduciary
relationships of the responsibilities of Government are secured and that no
unwarranted expenditure occurs.

The most substantive change introduced in the Bill is to the South African
Schools Act, where the implementation of the Act has shown some unfortunate
gaps. Perhaps the most dramatic and public evidence of these has been the
case of the former principal of Ermelo Hoërskool, who is alleged to have
diverted significant amounts from the school's fund into his own pockets,
only a few weeks ago. Regrettably, we now know that he was not alone in
that and we have had to address this serious problem, among others.

The amendments deal with four areas: firstly, the function of a school
governing body; secondly, the status of the representative council of
learners, as against other student bodies; thirdly, the functioning of the
school governing body; and finally, the management of funds of the school.

There are legal certainties that are provided in respect of the functions
of the school governing body to ensure that there is a clear separation of
functions between the governing body and the Department of Education. I
would like to remind members who were not members of this House in 1996
that we possibly have the most advanced legislation concerning the
participation of parents in the governing of schools.

I have always been astonished that this House not only passed this
legislation, but that the trade unions agreed to it in 1996. It gives
parents an authority and role, but I am not aware of any other country that
gives them that. But, occasionally, there are, in fact, errors and mistakes
that take place. To deal with this, then, what we say is that the principle
of a partnership between the governing body and the province, because they
are partners, must not be compromised. In any partnership it is necessary
to know and understand the different responsibilities of each partner.

In respect of learner bodies, the proposed legislation makes it very clear,
as far as students are concerned, that what was always intended in the
South African Schools Act was that the representative council of learners
should be and I quote ``the only recognised and legitimate learner body at
the school''. Of course, we said that the governing body should be
democratically elected. This is a principle of democracy working at the
lowest and most important level. We must also ask for this form of
representation in society, and schools are not exempt from this principled
representation.

However, in too many instances, another body, most often a prefect body,
which is not democratically elected, is put forward as a group representing
learners. And, everywhere where there has been trouble, particularly where
schools are now more representative in their composition, this has been
because there has not been a truly representative body of learners. So, the
amendment does not outlaw prefects. It merely seeks to ensure that they are
understood in their rightful place, usually as an arm of the management of
the school, which is what the prefects are. Prefects are appointed by the
school and serve a totally different function from the representative
council of learners.

Similarly, other bodies, including national student bodies like Cosas and
Azasco, may be encouraged at schools but should not be confused as
legitimate representatives of learners. I will make it very clear, however
unpopular it may be, that the political organisations, whatever their
strength, are not representatives of learners. It is elected
representatives who represent learners. So, the others are voluntary
associations whose mandates and accountabilities lie elsewhere.

Secondly, it should be quite clear that the representative body of
learners, where it is strong and representative, helps in the running of
the school. But, there is no place at all in our history or law where we
say that they have co-determination with the principal. We want to assert
in this House that this is a consultative body and principals are obliged
to consult. But, in the end, principals are paid to run the schools. This
fundamental aspect is very important, as such, as we are beginning to get
our school system to work.
As regards the functioning of the governing bodies, it has become apparent
that many governing bodies are not fulfilling their functions in terms of
the law. In some cases this is due to a lack of capacity. We are working
hard to build this capacity in a number of programmes. I hope that, within
the regulation, members of Parliament will play their part in assisting
governing bodies. What I said last year was that we should keep silly party
politics out of schools. That does not mean that public representatives
should not, under the new regulations, be involved in assisting in the
development of these governing bodies.

Regrettably, others have demonstrated a wilful neglect of their duties,
either with the aim of frustrating the professional management of the
school or the department, or to substitute themselves as the governors of
the schools. We cannot tolerate this, given the enormous powers which these
school governing bodies have been allocated.

We have, therefore, made provision that where a governing body ceases to
perform all or some of its functions, the head of department of the
province will be empowered to intervene either by the appointment of a
person to fulfil those neglected functions or to insist on the election of
a new governing body. At the same time, we have committed ourselves to
building capacity where there is a need for this and a willingness by
governing bodies to meet their responsibilities. I trust that this approach
will also be strongly supported.

We have also proposed an amendment which prevents governing bodies from
entering into any loan or overdraft arrangements without the permission of
the member of the executive council responsible for education. The
expectation is that the MEC will ensure that any loan which is approved is
educationally grounded, and not to be used for some trivial matter or for
something that cannot be regarded as a serious priority.

The final aspect that we deal with and also one that has elicited the most
comments and debates in committees is the utilisation of school funds. We
have discovered that many schools, especially those which are able to
collect substantial fees from the parents, charge high fees. Let me say
quite clearly that, whatever our social backgrounds, the fee structure in
South African public schools has to be investigated. Frankly, the fee
structure is too high. We do not want to have anecdotal stories of why it
is too high or what it is used for. But I cannot, in fact, as the Minister
of Education, countenance a fee structure where, in a public school,
students are asked to pay between R8 000 and R12 000 a year. This is
something that we have to look at very carefully. I will come back to the
House with a resolution as to what to do about this.

What is more important here is that in some of the schools the trustees
have been hiding money in trusts established by the schools. This is
completely untenable. To set up a trust and put the public moneys or school
fees into a trust removes accountability from the parents to a select group
of trustees who may, at any stage, without the consent of the school, amend
the purposes of the trust and use it for their own enrichment.

Some schools have done so under the mistaken belief that to contribute to a
trust brings about certain tax advantages. Well, I am happy to say, and hon
members may not know this, that my colleague, the Minister of Finance, has
decided that any financial contribution to a school, public or private, is
exempt from tax. Hon members should applaud this big development that the
Minister of Finance has introduced. There is, therefore, no need for such
trusts.

I have, therefore, proposed in the Bill that money from the school fund of
a public school may not be paid into a trust or be used to establish a
trust, and I call for hon members' support for this. School fees are public
moneys and must remain on the public domain, under the scrutiny of the
school governing body - and nobody can argue against that - which is also
required to submit its budget and financial reports to the department.
Money which has already been paid into a trust fund will have to be repaid
to the school except where there has been a proper utilisation in the
interest of the school.

I might add that this provision does not stop a private association of
parents or other interested parties from establishing a trust where the
beneficiary is a school. This is outside the domain of our legislation or
what we call public money which is what the school fees are. And this would
be a private arrangement between the trustees and the school. Most
important of all, as I said, such money would not be public money.

These amendments are all intended to bring about greater clarity and do not
introduce any departures from our policy or from the original purpose of
the Act. I trust that hon members will appreciate the need for constant
improvements to the legislation based on our experience of implementing it.
All the provinces have agreed to this legislation.

We must get rid of one myth: This is a move from a state-controlled system,
which is highly hierarchical, to one in which significant governance
responsibilities are placed in the hands of the communities. The principle
of moving power to the communities is a good one and we will not deviate
from that. In doing so, we have to ensure that, sometimes, unscrupulous and
reactionary persons who would seek to abuse these rights are not allowed to
do so.

I would like to say a word which is not in this script about the tolerance
of this House in respect of the matric examinations. May I compliment this
House for not politicising some of the problems that have risen in relation
to the matric examinations. With 550 000 candidates, thousands of newspaper
articles, examiners and teachers involved, what we have been able to do is,
in fact, to ensure that the examinations are held in due integrity and
probity.

After all, they are benchmarked against the Scottish Examination Board,
which is a very important element. The most important thing is that we have
to stand over because of the credibility of the examination process. I am
pleased to say that the latest investigation shows that not a single
examination paper has ever been found outside legitimate venues. That is an
important thing. But, as members know, there have been leaks and we have
dealt with this by taking very strong action.

Of course, the biggest action that we must take, and I am asking for the
assistance of the public and the police, is to expose the godfathers who
initiate these processes and it is the poor students who are on the
receiving end of this. I want to thank members very much for their support,
and we hope that we can show a similar kind of public consciousness because
there are certain things whose integrity is so important that we will make
it part of the normal arguments in politics. [Applause.]

Mr R S NTULI: Madam Speaker, hon Minister and colleagues, I want to
reciprocate the compliments of the Minister regarding the nonpoliticisation
of the Matric results. We deliberately took this stand because we know that
the issue of examinations is of national concern. We also did this with due
respect to the learners and parents, having been educators ourselves.

Having said that, I turn my attention to the matter at hand. The DP
welcomes this opportunity to state its position on the Education Laws
Amendment Bill. The Bill aims to amend the South African Schools Act, the
Further Education and Training Act and the Employment of Educators Act, as
has been indicated. These pieces of legislation had shortcomings and the
amendments seek to plug these loopholes.

Section 11 of the South African Schools Act provides for a representative
council of learners to be established at every school that enrols learners
in the 8th grade and beyond. Clause 1 of this Bill provides for this
council to be the only one, and here I am implying the council that still
has to be established. The prefect system, while it may continue, will not
be able to do so as we know it. In a sense, it is history. We do not lament
its demise because we also put priority on representivity.

Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 15 of the South African Schools Act to
provide the legal framework within which public schools can function. In
terms of the Bill public schools can only operate within the provisions of
the South African Schools Act. Clause 3 substitutes section 20 of the South
African Schools Act, which deals with the functions of the governing body.

While the Employment of Educators Act of 1998 and the Labour Relations Act
of 1995 made recommendations to the head of department on the appointment
of educators, the school governing bodies previously used the Employment of
Educators Act of 1994 and, obviously, there were loopholes in this as well.
Section 36 of the principal Act is amended to prohibit school governing
bodies from applying for overdrafts and raising money through loans without
obtaining the prior approval of the MEC.

Section 37(3) of the principal Act states that a public school must or may
open a banking account. The amendment of clause 7 prohibits governing
bodies from paying money from the school fund into a trust or establishing
a trust. In terms of the new legislation, money used to establish, or paid
into, a trust fund prior to the year 2002 must be paid back into the school
fund.

That trust funds may lead to abuse is a valid concern. However, the vast
majority of our schools are not corrupt. We should also note that the
increasing involvement of parents has been enormously beneficial to the
public school system. The benefits have certainly outweighed the
disadvantages. Besides, we have all the laws we currently need to stamp out
corruption where it possibly exists.

To obviate abuse of trust funds where it possibly exists, a preferred route
would be for the provincial heads of departments to monitor and oversee the
management and administration of such trusts. At any rate, the matter could
be taken up by the Auditor-General's office, who could be required to
undertake an audit of the records and financial statements of a trust
administered by a public school that is suspected of being involved in
corruption or mismanagement.

The DP understands what malpractices these amendments seek to prevent, and
we support this in principle. But we do not believe that the measures to
deal with the few who are corrupt should be applied to the honest majority.
In a way, this could shackle their creativity in raising funds and
investing those funds in the interest of education. Such a denial would put
especially the former model C schools in an invidious position as they
receive less state funding in terms of the norms and standards for funding
of public schools.

The limitation of the powers of school governing bodies has been
ameliorated to a certain extent by the Bill, making provision for the MEC
to grant schools permission to enter into loans and overdrafts or to open
another account where appropriate. For this provision to have any practical
value, the MECs have to be efficient and prompt in responding to such
requests and to avoid serious inconvenience to the schools involved.

The retrospective nature of the clause in the Bill relating to trust funds
is a cause for concern. The reason is that many schools have operated trust
funds for decades, perfectly legally and without any corruption or
mismanagement. In terms of this Bill, which will become law soon and before
the start of the year 2002 at any rate, many routine procedures of
financial administration which are currently legal will become illegal. We
therefore suggest that there should be a sufficient phasing-in period of
six months for schools to adjust to the system.

Another recurring area of concern, as evidenced by this Bill, is that
national Government continues with its tendency to centralise control and
remove the discretion of MECs to establish what is best for provincial and
local circumstances. Gradually, but steadily, the MECs for education are
losing their jurisdiction over education, especially regarding school
governance. There are sufficient laws and regulations available to stop
malpractices. We do not need another law that will reduce the capacity of
schools to assist the state to raise money needed to fund quality education
in all schools.

Finally, we need to emphasise that the DP opposes the increasing tendency
to centralise power by the national department. This leaves us with no
option but to oppose the Bill. We want to stress that we are not opposed to
the content of the Bill. What we are actually concerned about is the
constant centralisation of power to the national Ministry.

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, may I express my thanks to the Whips of other
parties for allowing me to speak now. I have to catch a plane at 16:05.

'n Mens gebruik nie 'n 16 pd-hamer om 'n muggie dood te slaan nie. 'n Mens
jaag ook nie al die kinders uit die klas as een of twee 'n bietjie uit
hulle kassie spring nie, en dit is presies wat hierdie wysigingswetsontwerp
wil doen. Enkele bestuursliggame het dalk die gesonde finansiële instrument
van trusts misbruik, nou word almal die gebruik daarvan verbied.

Die departement het geskrik vir die moontlikheid dat hulle dalk sal moet
opdok as bestuursliggame lenings aangaan wat hulle nie kan diens nie, nou
moet álle bestuursliggame soos minderjariges of ongerehabiliteerde
insolvente die toestemming van die departement kry as hulle selfs net 'n
huurkoopkontrak vir 'n kopieermasjien wil aangaan. Sommige bestuursliggame
het nie die riglyne gevolg wat die departement gestel het vir die formaat
van hulle begroting nie, nou word almal verplig om dit presies op 'n
voorgeskrewe wyse te doen, ongeag verskillende omstandighede.

Talle sinvolle, positiewe en probleemoplossende voorleggings en voorstelle
is gedoen wat inderdaad aan die doelstellings van hierdie wetsontwerp sou
beantwoord, sonder om die effektiewe bestuur van bestuursliggame aan bande
te lê. Die finale wetsontwerp wat vandag aan hierdie Huis vir goedkeuring
voorgelê word, bevat egter nie een enkele wysiging wat voorgestel is nie.
Opposisiepartye kan maar voorstelle maak, burgerlike instellings kan
voorleggings maak, maar dit help niks. Big Brother het gepraat.

Optrede soos hierdie maak positiewe en konstruktiewe opposisie moeilik en
plaas 'n vraagteken agter die opregtheid van die ANC se openheid tot ``co-
operative governance''. Hierdie saak gaan oor meer as net enkele
administratiewe wysigings. Dit gaan oor die volgehoue proses om
bestuursliggame as instellings van die burgerlike samelewing aan bande te
lê en aan die staatsinstellings onderworpe te maak. Bestuursliggame het
inderdaad vandag 'n groot verantwoordelikheid, moet 'n besigheid van groot
omvang effektief bestuur en die toenemende inperking van hulle bevoegdhede
gaan egter uiteindelik negatief inwerk op hulle bestuursvermoë. Geïsoleerde
wanpraktyke moes aangespreek word, want met hierdie wetsontwerp word die
kind met die badwater uitgegooi. Die AEB kan nie hierdie wetsontwerp
ondersteun nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[One does not use a 16 lb hammer to kill a gnat. One also does not chase
all the children out of a class if one or two get a bit out of hand, and
that is precisely what this amending Bill wants to do. One or two governing
bodies may have abused the sound financial instrument of trusts, and now
everyone is being forbidden to use them.

The department panicked at the possibility that they may possibly have to
pay if governing bodies take out loans they cannot service, now all
governing bodies have to get the permission of the department even if they
want to enter into a hire-purchase contract for a photocopy machine, like
minors and unrehabilitated insolvents. Some governing bodies did not follow
the guidelines set by the department for the format of their budget, now
they are all being obliged to do it precisely in a prescribed manner,
irrespective of differing circumstances.
Numerous meaningful, positive and problem-solving submissions and proposals
were made which would indeed meet the objectives of this Bill, without
hampering the effective management of governing bodies. However, the final
Bill submitted to this House today for adoption does not contain a single
amendment that was proposed. Opposition parties are welcome to make
submissions, civil institutions can make submissions, but nothing helps.
Big Brother has spoken.

Actions like these make positive and constructive opposition difficult and
place a question mark over the sincerity of the ANC's openness to co-
operative governance. This matter is about more than a few administrative
amendments. It is about the sustained process of keeping governing bodies
as institutions of civil society in check and making them subject to
Government institutions. Today governing bodies indeed have a big
responsibility, must manage a large business effectively and the increasing
restriction of their powers is eventually going to have a negative effect
on their management ability. Isolated cases of malpractice should have been
addressed, because with this Bill the baby is being thrown out with the
bath water. The AEB cannot support this Bill.]
Prof S M MAYATULA: Madam Speaker, I deliberately allowed the hon Aucamp to
speak first so that I would be able to respond.

Unfortunately, he was not able to attend the meetings of the portfolio
committee where we first fine-tuned the Bill. We went through all the
representations and tried to clarify where we stood with regard to the main
issues. He did not have any formal proposal as far as the amendment that we
are proposing is concerned.

Hon members, this Bill is an important amending Bill. I would like to start
by trying to indicate what these amendments are intended to achieve. They
are intended to provide for the representative council of learners to be
the only recognised body at a school. This recognition relates to the
administration of the school and does not preclude the establishment of
other learner bodies such as Cosas and others. It is intended to make
further provision regarding the failure of a governing body to perform its
function so that the department can intervene and put corrective measures
in place. It is intended that schools should only raise loans with the
approval of the MEC to prohibit public schools from paying school funds
into a trust fund.

The committee successfully addressed and clarified all the concerns which
were raised during the public hearings. I would like to confine myself to
clauses 5 and 6 which deal with loans and trusts. Firstly, I would like to
clarify what this Bill is not intended to do. It is not intended to stifle
fundraising by public schools. It is not intended to prevent public schools
from taking out loans provided a written approval is obtained from the MEC,
not the Minister, hon Ntuli. It is not intended to prohibit public schools
from investing surplus funds in other accounts provided the approval of the
MEC is obtained. It is not intended to prohibit the establishment of trusts
provided school funds are not used. If all these activities are not
prohibited, why the fuss about the approval of the MEC?

The hon Ntuli says the Bill seeks to centralise power in the national
Minister. [Interjections.]

Mr T D LEE: He is normally right. He is always right. [Interjections.]

Prof S M MAYATULA: The truth of the matter is: Let us remember that while
the independent schools are independent legal entities and the buck stops
with them, the public schools remain public schools and the Government
becomes responsible when the chips are down. Without this piece of
legislation if anything were to go wrong as far as those loans are
concerned, whether we like it or not, those people would go to the legal
entity, in this case, the Government.

I would like to address myself to the issue of trusts. A perception is
created here that by saying school funds should not be put in a trust fund
we are preventing the private sector from assisting schools, because the
only channel through which they can assist schools and get a benefit is
through trusts. That is totally incorrect. Most of us, even in this
Chamber, send our children to the former model C schools. Most of us are
involved in school fundraising projects for our schools. Most of us are
involved in campaigns encouraging the private sector to contribute
financially to the promotion of education and health projects for the
betterment of our people's lives. Can we at the same time, in the form of
this Bill, try to stifle that?
We want the private sector to assist us. But the question they ask, is:
``If we come in, as a party from the private sector, what is in it for us?
Shall we get our tax benefits?'' The answer is a big yes. As the Minister
has just said, and I also want to remind this House, on 23 February 2000
our Minister of Finance made a proposal in this House which was accepted.
He proposed that a provision be made for a new definition of public benefit
organisations which would qualify for tax exemptions. He went further and
said that the tax deductability of donations should be extended to
preprimary schools, primary schools, children's homes, organisations caring
for the aged and those that focus on HIV/Aids care. The Income Tax
Amendment Act of 2000 confirmed this position. What this means, is that
sponsors do not have to channel their funds through school trusts in order
to get tax benefits.

It is important to note that section 16 of the South African Schools Act
already creates the perception that the governing body of a public school
must act in a position of trust. The schools are already trusts and can get
benefits from whatever angle. The Bill does not amend this. All it does is
to confirm and strengthen these benefits. Section 37(2) of the South
African Schools Act provides that all money received by a public school,
including school fees and voluntary contributions, must be paid into a
school fund. This Bill is directed to that money which we referred to as a
school fund. That money belongs to the school, not the national Minister
and not the MEC. It is only the school governing body and the parents who
should have a say over the use of that money.

Should part of that money be put in a trust, the trustees call the tune
because they sit on a board and decide how that money should be used, and
the parents are not part of that. If contributions made directly into the
school fund attract the same benefit as when money is put in a trust, what
could be the reason for putting the school funds in a trust? Not only does
money donated directly to a school fund bring about the same tax benefit,
this also brings about transparency which is what our democracy is all
about.

Transparency can only bring about good financial management so that we do
not have many Ermelos. Everybody knows how much each school has, and what
it is that it is going to do with that amount. Hon members should remember
that even schools are put into quantums for the sake of funding. We need to
know how much each school has so that we know how much to give from the
Government's perspective. Let us encourage and assist the school governing
bodies to govern and control their funds without any interference from
trustees. Let there be no room to have some school funds stashed away in a
trust out of reach of the parents and the department.

Let me end with examples of private sector projects where a company donates
funds directly to the schools and, in the process, helps them to help
themselves. This is something that is happening even as I speak. I am
referring here to the Decillion Foundation which has sponsored the building
of two community schools, and is in the process of building a third school.

In the first project, on 12 October 2001 the Decillion Foundation handed
over a project of about R135 000 to Daluxolo Primary School in Idutwya in
the Eastern Cape. The community of Daluxolo opened their own banking
account and, through their own initiative, using the money that they
received from the Decillion Foundation, were able to build three
classrooms. They were able to buy furniture for their school, fence it, buy
a water tank, and build toilets. This sponsor is going to get benefits. On
2 November 2001 the same company, Decillion Foundation, donated R120 000 to
Namadzavho School at Elim, in Louis Trichardt, in the Northern Province,
with the intention of doing the same thing.

Does this Bill mean that parents cannot form a trust if they want to? Let
me answer that. This does not preclude individual parents from sitting down
and deciding that they want to form a trust. As long as that money goes
straight from their pockets to the trust, because nobody can control that,
and they can now decide with which project they are going to assist. But,
once the money is part of a school fund, it should be governed and handled
by the school governing body, and not by anybody else.

If we all have this understanding, I think there will be no perception that
this Bill is going to stifle fundraising, because all of us, individually
and collectively, are out there doing that and we want our communities and
the private sector to come to the party and assist us as we build our
schools. [Applause.]

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Madam Speaker, I wonder whether the empty seats today have
something to do with the forthcoming defection clause, whether it is a
happy payday thing or an attitude towards the Bill on Education that we are
debating here today.

Maybe I should start off by commending the hon the Minister on his skilful
use of the Hegelian dialectic in the construction of this speech. It is of
some renaissance type, I have been noticing for the time that I have been
here.

One cannot help but notice that from the formerly oppressed section of the
House, when the Minister and the chairperson of the committee spoke, we
could hear some hosannas from the formerly oppressed and also some
nostalgic banalities against transformation by others. Therefore, I am
compelled to say that some misunderstanding and invective are deliberately
orchestrated, like Malcolm X said, ``to serve as a peg for those nervous
Nellies and Uncle Toms to hang their perplexing and disturbing anxieties
on''.

The Bill before us today helps to ban these misrepresentations - as the say
in Latin, ``Pro Salute Animalium''. [Interjections.] I was teaching long
before the member knew about education. It bans those servile,
dysfunctional, dislocated, disconnected, and dissenting people who are
serving their masters' interests forever and ever, amen. [Interjections.]

Mr T D LEE: You sound disturbed. [Laughter.]

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Madam Speaker, the Republic of South Africa is undergoing a
revolutionary change in its educational landscape. This Education Laws
Amendment Bill amends the South African Schools Act and amends the pre-1994
language usage which was not gender-sensitive and user-friendly and had
lots of other shortcomings. Allow me to quote Dr Martin Luther King Jr, for
those who read about him. He said, and I quote:


  The acceptable year of the Lord is now ...

Not that I look like a preacher or something. I believe that this is the
acceptable year to offer options to poor children who are stuck in a system
that is not preparing them to compete in today's global society. This is
the acceptable year of the Lord to bring to the brokenhearted parents who
see their children move through the school system by social promotion and
come out the other end of the system as nothing but dysfunctional
illiterates. Yes, this is indeed the acceptable year of the Lord to
challenge the last vestiges of the apartheid education system.

The recognition of the democratically elected representative council of
learners does not mean the banning of prefects or Cosas or Azasco, or the
Sacos of this world, but it liberates many learners from imposed
ideological and other forms of bondage, and replaces it with democratic and
accountable structures that transform and build learners, and their
leadership, confidence, and future in society, not taking children out of
the classrooms on excursions and orgies on the streets of Johannesburg, as
has happened in the past, thus transforming the children to become
scoundrels, scallywags, skollies and so forth.

Yes, we have advanced this legislation in respect of school governing
bodies, but, notwithstanding the critical role and responsibility, it lends
justification for intervention by heads of departments. But, they need
capacitation, because of all these anomalies that exist between those with
affluent backgrounds and those with less. I think that we need to talk
about positive discrimination in poor areas, and even rural areas in this
regard. In these areas where the school governing bodies underperform or
exceed their mandates, or are manipulated and dictated to by headmasters,
if that is the case, we will get more Ermelo's and more allegations of Koos
Krugers, and so forth.

This brings the IFP to support clause 6 of the Bill that limits schools to
having single banking accounts and not to channel school funds into trust
accounts and so forth. Yes, indeed, money is the root of all evil and if we
think of the Koos Kruger saga, these allegations against Koos Kruger, I
mean the people allege that this man paid for his booze and servants, he
even went to epicurean centres and had a good time with school funds.
Somebody alleged in the NCOP that he even denied a black student a bursary
from the funds that he acquired.

It does lend credence to the concern by the MEC for Education in the
Eastern Cape, Mr Sizane, when he elucidated on the conquering Roman
emperors who sought to change the workings of the Greek empire and
institutions but left the Greek teachers in the empire's schools. What we
need here is whistle blowers, toll free numbers and incentives to close the
net. We need to take off our silk gloves, and to show them our nails.

The IFP believes that the Education Laws Amendment Bill will assist in
normalising public schools and further education in our country, and we
therefore support the Bill. [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, if the previous speaker was a teacher, I
can understand why there is a lack of quality education in the classroom.
[Laughter.] The hon the Minister should be congratulated on his criticism
of Big Brother. It is high time that somebody in the executive spoke out
against the trash that masquerades as reality TV, thank you.

But unfortunately the hon the Minister himself wants to play the role of
Big Brother, by wanting to control education from the cradle to the grave.
The Education Laws Amendment Bill is a case in point. While most countries
are currently allowing space for a market approach to education, our
Government is tightening control on every facet of education. Mr Seepe of
Vista University is right when he says in The Star that the problem with
our education system is that its control is too centralised.

Clauses 5 and 6, dealing with loans and trust funds, will have the effect
of severely curtailing the ability of governing bodies to discharge their
responsibilities in terms of section 21 of the Schools Act, of maintaining
and improving school property. Yes, schools should of course not be allowed
to incur financial debt in an uncontrolled manner. But loans remain an
essential vehicle for the purchase of assets which cannot be funded from
school fees in any one year. Making it as difficult as possible to obtain a
loan, as clause 5 does, serves no purpose.

The argument that if a public school cannot comply with its obligations the
state will be liable to compensate claims against the public school is
debatable. There is very strong legal opinion that section 61 of the
Schools Act does not relate to contractual claims at all. Clause 6 forbids
a school governing body from establishing a trust fund from school funds or
paying school fees into a trust.

Let me say this at the outset: the New NP condemns any abuse of trust
funds. Compulsory school fees should not be diverted to a trust fund in
order to get a bigger subsidy from the state. Trust funds should be used
for no other purpose than for educational purposes, to benefit all the
learners of a specific school. Any illegal or irresponsible actions on the
part of governing bodies relating to trust funds should be rooted out
completely. However, as has been said here before, one should not throw the
baby out with the bathwater. Many schools have operated trust funds for
decades, perfectly legally and without corruption, as a vehicle to
supplement the resources supplied by the state, and such trusts should not
be terminated.

There is a misconception. In most instances - I will go so far as to say in
90% of instances - the trustees are either parents or members of the
governing body. In my view retrospective illegality, as contained in clause
6, is bad law-making, unpractical and perhaps even unconstitutional, and
should be deleted completely. All that is going to happen in practice is
that trusts currently controlled by school governing bodies will be re-
established outside the control of the school, and this is exactly what the
Minister does not want to happen.

Net 'n laaste opmerking oor die verteenwoordigende rade van leerders, wat
nou die enigste erkende liggame van skole word. Daar bestaan 'n
wanopvatting dat alle prefekstelsels ondemokraties is. Dit is nie heeltemal
waar nie, maar die rede hoekom hulle nie 100% demokraties is nie, is omdat
hulle 'n belangrike rol vervul in die handhawing van dissipline in skole.
'n Gewone oop demokratiese sisteem sal beteken die gewildste leerlinge word
prefekte, en dit is nie altyd bevorderlik vir dissipline nie. Die Minister
het egter tereg opgemerk die prefekstelsel sal weer na vore kom as 'n
subkomitee van die verteenwoordigende raad van leerders. Die Nuwe NP steun
nie die wetgewing nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[One last comment about the representative councils of learners, which are
now becoming the only recognised bodies of schools. There is a
misconception that all prefect systems are undemocratic. This is not
entirely true, but the reason they are not 100% democratic is because they
play a very important role in the maintenance of discipline at schools. A
open democratic system will mean that the most popular pupils become
prefects and this is not always beneficial to discipline. However, the
Minister rightly noted that the prefect system will once again come to the
fore as a sub-committee of the representative council of learners. The New
NP does not support this legislation.]

The Minister said all the provinces supported the legislation or the Bill.
To the best of my knowledge the MEC for Education in the Western Cape does
not support the Bill. [Applause.]

Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker, Minister of Education and colleagues, the
UDM supports the Education Laws Amendment Bill. The Bill seeks to amend,
amongst other things, the South African Schools Act of 1996, so as to
provide for the representative council of learners to be the only
recognised learner body at a school and to make further provisions
regarding the failure of a governing body to perform its functions.

It is our view that the Bill seeks to provide specific content or meaning
as well as clarity to some sections of the principal Act, where otherwise
the intentions of the legislation were not clearly spelled out. Whilst we
welcome the establishment and recognition of one representative council of
learners at a school by a member of the executive council, this should not
be construed to mean that other learner bodies shall be forbidden.

The representative council of learners is the umbrella body. It funds and
controls the activities of other formations. Considering the critical role
and responsibility of the governing bodies, there is justification for the
intervention by the head of the department to ensure that the governing
bodies continue to perform their functions in terms of the law. But it is
equally important for the department to provide a clear mechanism as well
as to identify and act upon situations that create a vacuum in the
performance of functions by school governing bodies..

There are reported cases where some schools run either without a governing
body or a full complement thereof, for an unreasonable length of time.
While section 36 of the principal Act permits a governing body to take all
reasonable measures within its means to supplement the resources supplied
by the state in order to improve the quality of education, it may not, in
terms of subsection 2, enter into a loan or overdraft agreement without the
written approval of the MEC. It is hoped that such written approval by the
MEC will be obtainable with the least possible delay.

Regarding the amendment of section 37 of Act 84 of 1996, subsection 3, the
UDM is in full support of the keeping of one banking account by a governing
body of a public school, obviously for purposes of proper control. The
governing body of a public school may, however, with the approval of the
MEC of Education, invest surplus money in another account. We are also
satisfied, after a thorough briefing by the department, that the amendment
of subsection 6 as a precautionary measure only prohibits the payment of
school fund money into a trust or that the said school fund should not be
used to establish a trust. If a trust was established from a school fund of
a public school or if such money was paid into a trust prior to January
2002, such trust or payment is invalid and the money must be paid back into
the school fund.

The amendment must not be construed as prohibiting the establishment of a
school trust. Former learners, their parents and interested persons may
establish a school trust. The amendment prohibits the use of schools funds
to establish a trust. [Applause.]
Mrs D G NHLENGETHWA: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon members, we come from
a thorny past where we were packed in bags and couriered to training
colleges to become teachers, and couriered to Hammanskraal to train as
policemen. Lettuce was speed-serviced or e-mailed to universities and
technikons to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc. This Bill is amended
so as to boost the morale of our teachers, so that they will produce
lettuce, not cabbages. The ANC's policy is to make every workplace
productive and transparent. Every person has the right to a fair trial and
to be heard before being condemned and found guilty.

Section 38 of the principal Act is amended to make provision for a school
governing body of a public school to prepare annual budgets, according to
the prescription determined by the MEC in a provincial Gazette. This budget
will show the estimated income and expenditure of the school for the
following year. This prescription, not the guidelines, provides for
assisting those disadvantaged public schools and governing bodies by giving
them an easy and understandable way of doing the school budget. The
provision will also ensure that budgets reflect specific budget items,
which will be in a format that all parents can understand when approving
the school budget. It also encourages uniformity of budget standards in a
province, so as to transform the public schools to the same level of
education.

This Bill also amends the Employment of Educators Act, Act 76 of 1998. The
purpose of this amendment is to transform the education system into one
that serves the needs and interests of all the people of South Africa and
upholds their fundamental rights. If an educator is accused of misconduct,
he or she must be subjected to disciplinary measures. By disciplinary
measures we mean corrective measures and not punitive measures. That is why
the ANC sees to it that discipline is applied in a prompt, fair, consistent
and just manner.

The disciplinary procedure has a number of forms. Forms A to D are included
in this Bill so as to assist the accused educator to appeal or object when
the presiding officer decides on an appropriate sanction against the
educator. The educator is entitled to bring witnesses, additional written
evidence, legal representation and/or organised trade unions. This poses
the challenge for us that all presiding officers will have to be trained in
labour relations. With regard to the disciplinary procedure, if the
educator is accused of misconduct, the employer, meaning the presiding
officer, summonses the educator to appear before a disciplinary hearing by
sending him or her form D.

Lomhwashabula wencwadzi latawunikwa wona thishela kufanele uchaze lilanga,
indzawo kanye nesikhatsi lapho kutawutsetfwa khona lelicala. Sitfunywa
kanye nathishela kufanele basayine ngalesikhatsi sitfunywa sinika thishela
lomhwashabula wesamanisi. (Translation of siSwati paragraph follows.)

[The summons with which the educator is served should state the date, place
and time of the disciplinary hearing. Both the messenger and the educator
must sign when the messenger delivers the summons to the educator.]

The nature of the transgression is explained in form C.

Thishela ubhalelwa secwayiso atiswe kutsi unelicala lekungatiphatsi kahle
esikolweni, kuchazwe nekutsi yini lalakwentile kuze atfolakale kutsi
sewephule umtsetfo. Lesi-ke secwayiso lekufanele thishela asitfole emalanga
lasihlanu lingakefiki lilanga lekutsetfwa kwelicala. Ngaleyo ndlela
utakwati kutfola sikhatsi sekutsi abugcogce kahle bufakazi bakhe.

Ngalelilanga lekutsetfwa kwelicala, lomTsetfosivivinyo lesikhuluma ngawo

Kufanele kube ngummeli lobuya kutinyonyani tebasebenti, njengobe bese ngike

ngekwemtsetfo.

Ngekuvumelana nemcashi wakhe angabaletsa bofakazi bakhe nome bufakazi
lobubhaliwe, engete kulobu lobukhona labebuletse ekucaleni. Nakatfolakala
anelicala kubhalwa secwayiso sekucala lekutsiwa yi-first warning.
(Translation of siSwati paragraphs follows.)

[A written warning is sent to the educator informing him or her that he or
she is being charged with misconduct and also describing the nature of the
transgression. The educator should receive this warning five days before
the date of the disciplinary hearing. In this manner the educator will have
enough time to put together his or her defence.

In terms of this Bill, on the day of the disciplinary hearing, the educator
has the right to bring a legal representative. As I have already mentioned,
this legal representative should come from a registered trade union.

By agreement between the educator and his or her employer, the educator can
bring witnesses or additional written evidence. If found guilty, the
educator is issued with a written warning referred to as the first
warning.]

On concluding the disciplinary hearing, if the educator is found guilty, a
first warning, which is form A, is written.

Leso secwayiso sifakwa efayeleni lalowo thishela lasemsebentini, futsi
lesecwayiso lesi sihlala tinyanga letisitfupha. Lesecwayiso lesi futsi
siyamnika thishela lilungelo lekuticelela shwele, akwati kutsi endlulisele
embili licala lakhe nakangeneliseki ngesigwebo lasinikwe nakutsetfwa
licala.

Nakatfolakala kutsi thishela sewuphindze wenta lelinye licala kantsi
atikapheli tinyanga letisitfupha atfole secwayiso sekucala, ubhalelwa
secwayiso sekugcina, lekutsiwa yi-final warning. Lesecwayiso sekugcina
sibitwa ngekutsi ngu-form B. Nakuleso secwayiso thishela uyanikwa litfuba
lekutsi abhale incwadzi lephikisana naleso sigwebo lesikhishiwe nangabe
akeneliseki, aletse lobunye bufakazi bekutikhalela. (Translation of siSwati
paragraphs follows.)

[This warning is put in the educator's employee file for a period of six
months. This warning also affords the educator the right to appeal if he or
she is not satisfied with the sentence passed at the disciplinary hearing.

If, within a period of six months of the first warning, the educator is
found guilty of misconduct a second time, he or she is issued with a second
warning referred to as the final warning. This final warning is called form
B. In respect of this warning, too, if he or she is not satisfied, the
educator has the right to write a letter appealing against his or her
sentence and to bring additional evidence for his or her defence.]

I want to thank the ANC-led Government, which has made it possible to
transform this legislation. This ensures a better life for all. I just ask
myself about those who are confused and always opposing everything. What is
it that they are going to gain, after all, in return? Since I have been
here, Mr Geldenhuys has only participated in this debate regarding the
issues of money and trusts. [Interjections.] Sorry, I am protected. He is
only interested in money and trusts.

In conclusion, allow me to wish all members a Merry Christmas and a
prosperous New Year, and to those beasts that we call rapists, I wish them
life sentences behind bars. That is where they belong. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, with reference to the amendment of section 25
of Act 84 of 1996, this concerns governing bodies which are not functioning
properly. This amendment may or may not solve the problem of nonfunctioning
governing bodies. If a governing body fails to perform its functions, what
is more important is the building of capacity of newly appointed members,
but this cannot be done without the necessary resources. The replacement of
members is not necessarily a solution.

The question must be asked: What resources will the Minister and the
Department of Education make available to empower governing bodies because
it is in the empowerment of governing bodies that one will find a solution.
Changing the laws is not enough. If governing bodies of poorer communities
do not perform because they lack skills and resources, this must be
corrected by capacity-building workshops.

The ACDP agrees with the amendment of section 36 regarding unauthorised
overdrafts or loans. We agree that colleges must work within their budgets.
However, where we disagree, is to legislate that a governing body may not
enter into an overdraft agreement without the written agreement of the MEC.
For us this is unpractical, and it will never work. Let me give a practical
example. If 30 000 schools in a province have a need for an overdraft
facility of R500 to R1 000 for a month or two, the Bill says that they
should all apply to the MEC for approval. The provincial departments do not
have the administrative capacity to handle all these requests.

The amendment does not stipulate the criteria that would be used by the MEC
to accept or refuse an overdraft. This is a subjective power of the MEC,
and I can only foresee huge bottlenecks. A better alternative is workshops
for governing bodies to teach them to live within their means. This Bill
for us represents too much control, and we therefore cannot support the
Bill.

With regard to the governing bodies of public schools, they should have the
right to establish trust funds. We agree, however, that this cannot be done
with school fees, but they should be allowed to establish a trust fund with
other fees raised by school bazaars, donations, etc, in the private sector.
I understand why the school fees are so high. It is the failure of the
Department of Education to employ sufficient teachers which causes a
teacher-pupil ratio as high as 1:50. [Time expired.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mev die Speaker, ter aanvang wil ek sê dat die VF nie
die Wysigingswetsontwerp op Onderwyswette sal ondersteun nie.

Die agb Minister en die ANC regering kom aan die een kant en sê die fondse
en geld van ouers is die fondse en geld van die staat en dat daarmee op 'n
sekere voorgeskrewe wyse gehandel moet word. Die VF is ten gunste van
reëls, regulasies en riglyne waarvolgens geld bestee moet word. Daar moet
allermins geleentheid vir korrupsie wees.

Daar word egter van die ouergemeenskap verwag om geld aan die skool te
verskaf sodat die skool sekere toerusting kan koop. 'n Goeie voorbeeld is
geld om rekenaars te koop. Daar word van die ouer verwag om sy bydrae te
lewer. Wanneer die ouers egter optree en die geld in 'n trust sit, word
gesê hulle mag dit nie doen nie, want daar bestaan kommer omdat die geld in
'n trust wanbestee en korrupsie gepleeg kan word.

Ek wil vir die agb Minister vra: As 'n amptenaar in sy departement
korrupsie pleeg, gaan hy as Minister bedank? Aanvaar hy daardie volle
verantwoordelikheid? Want dit is wat hier gebeur. Omdat daar 'n geval was
waar 'n trust wanbestuur en geld verkeerd aangewend is, word almal nou
gestraf en verbied om 'n trust te vestig. Wat die VF betref, is dit
onbillik en onregverdig. Aan die een kant vra die staat ouers om van hul
kant bydraes te lewer, maar hy wil sê hoe hulle dit moet doen.

Ek wil ook vir die agb Minister sê belastingbetalersgeld is nie die staat
se geld nie; dit is die belastingbetaler se geld en behoort ook aangewend
te word tot die beste voordeel van die belastingbetaler. Die staat kan nie
eenvoudig voorskriftelik wees en sê hulle mag nie 'n trust stig nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, to begin with, I want to state that the
FF will not support the Education Laws Amendment Bill.

The hon Minister and the ANC Government say on the one hand that the funds
and money of parents are the funds and money of the state and that they
should be dealt with in a certain prescribed way. The FF is in favour of
rules, regulations and guidelines in terms of which money should be spent.
There must be no opportunity for corruption.

However, parents are expected to supply money to the school in order for
the school to buy certain equipment. A good example is money to buy
computers. The parent is expected to make his contribution. However, when
the parents act and put money in a trust fund, they are told they are not
allowed to do that, because there is concern that the money in the trust
fund could be misappropriated or corruption could be committed.

I wish to ask the hon Minister: If an official commits corruption in his
department, will he, as Minister, resign from his job? Does he accept full
responsibility? Because this is what is happening here. Because there has
been a case where a trust fund was misused and money was applied
incorrectly, everyone is being punished and prevented from establishing a
trust fund. As far as the FF is concerned, this is unreasonable and unfair.
On the one hand the state asks the parents to make contributions but it
wants to prescribe how they are suppose to do so.

I also wish to say to the hon Minister that the taxpayer's money is not the
money of the state; it is the taxpayer's money and should also be applied
in the best interest of the taxpayer. The state cannot simply be
prescriptive and say that they are not allowed to establish a trust fund.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson and hon members, the Bill seeks to amend three
Acts; the South African Schools Act, the Further Education and Training Act
and the Employment of Educators Act.

In an effort to bring stability in public schools with learners in Grade 8
and higher, the Bill provides for the establishment of representative
councils of learners which should be the only recognised and legitimate
learner body at each school. This measure will put paid to the current
situation which has learners concerning themselves with political
activities because of the movements they belong to. The business of
learners is to learn and hone their leadership skills under the guidance of
their school teachers.

School governing bodies are called upon to use the Employment of Educators
Act of 1998 and the Labour Relations Act of 1995 when they make
recommendations to the heads of department on the appointments of
educators. Procedures laid down in these Acts guide how appointments should
be made. This will bring an end to appointments made on the grounds of
familiarity. All appointments of educators have to be made on merit.

We call on parents to develop and take an interest in the education of
their children and, in keeping with education norms elsewhere, determine
what their children should be taught. Parents must rise to the occasion and
influence the education of their children to the extent of being involved
in the development of the curriculum, otherwise others will do it for them.

All public schools and public further education and training institutions
will be prohibited from raising loans or even entering into collateral
agreements in the name of the institutions. They may not establish trusts
with money belonging to the institutions, as in the end such transactions
will end up hidden from the school governing bodies who take office later.
The only regret is that when this legislation finally becomes law, it may
be too late for institutions to effect the closures in time to beat the
beginning of 2002.

The UCDP supports the Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, it is acknowledged that this Bill plugs the
loopholes found in three Acts, namely the South African Schools Act, the
Further Education and Training Act and the Employment of Educators Act.

In terms of the amendments made to the South African Schools Act,
satisfaction is expressed regarding the establishment of a representative
council of learners at every public school. This wil prevent the common
trap of prefect bodies being established by the management and not by the
learners, at the same time providing a framework of legal parameters with
which learner representative councils must comply.

It has often occurred that school governing bodies have hidden moneys, and
mislead parents as to the financial standing of the institution. Clause 6
certainly introduces a provision to avoid the recurrence of such treachery
and is hereby applauded. The reasons for allowing trust funds are supported
and it is gladly noted that parents may receive tax benefits for a direct
contribution to school funds.

The provisions made in terms of a school's annual budget are supported. It
is felt that lots of communication between departments is required to
ensure that these budgets are drawn up adequately and efficiently. In terms
of the Employment of Educators Act, the amendments made appear in order,
and satisfaction is expressed in terms of the loopholes that have now been
plugged.

With reference to the Further Education and Training Act, clause 13 is
fully supported and its provision should be strictly adhered to. The
seeking of approval from the MEC will certainly put a handle on the
situation and ensure that overdrafts are in fact not taken. Further
provisions expressing the situation as to when the absence of liability
will avail are in order and should receive full co-operation.

The MF supports the Education Laws Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Mr L M KGWELE: Chairperson, as a fundamental point of policy, the ANC has
always believed that public schools embody the broad public interest in
education and need to be organised, governed and resourced in a manner
which is faithful to the Constitution, and which enables Government bodies
to discharge their obligations under the Constitution. Foremost among these
obligations is the need to base the public provision of schooling for all
South African children on the principles of equity and redress of past
inequalities and discrimination. It is within this context that we support
the Bill before the House this afternoon.
The hon the Minister, Comrade Benji Ntuli, and I were honoured, on behalf
of the Portfolio Committee on Education, during the weekend of 21-23
September 2001, to be part of an epoch-making conference which was a
milestone for people's education - the launching of a nonracial,
progressive National Association of School Governing Bodies. Delegates
representing school governing bodies from across all nine provinces of our
country assembled in Johannesburg under the theme ``Towards enhancing
democratic and effective school governance for quality public education''.

The historic launching conference, attended by parents of learners,
learners, educators, student formations and teacher formations, expressed
its unequivocal support for Government's transformation agenda and in
particular endorsed its support for this particular Bill before the House -
the Education Laws Amendment Bill of 2001.

As the ANC, we appreciate and support the courage and commitment of the
Education Ministry to review and strengthen policy frameworks to ensure
that South Africans have the knowledge, values and skills required to
facilitate social and personal development and economic growth, and to
strengthen our democracy, our people and our nation.

It is for this reason that we strongly feel that we need to remind the
``Deurmekaar Alliance'' and the opportunistic ACDP that the people of South
Africa have charged the ANC with the responsibility of transforming the
South African society, and that while they might have the luxury to play
politics, misrepresent and distort our policies, the ANC has a mandate
which we cannot fail to execute - the acceleration of the transformation of
the education system on the basis of access, equity and quality. In this
process, new regulations, policies and legislation remain the indispensable
skeleton framework architecture of our future.

The attitude of the ``Deurmekaar Alliance'' towards the positive change in
education and their motivation for objecting to this specific Bill have
nothing to do with accountability, democracy and transparency, which the
Bill seeks to entrench, particularly in school governance and management.
While post-apartheid education legislation identifies the objective of
quality education as a core principle driving education reform, we find it
intriguing and deplorable that there is not a single piece of legislation
related to education tabled before this assembly that was ever supported by
the DP, the New NP or the alliance.

The DP and its alliance opposed and voted against the National Education
Policy Act, the South African Schools Act and the South African
Qualifications Authority Act. They opposed and voted against the Educators'
Employment Act and the South African Council of Educators Act. Again, they
opposed and voted against the Higher Education Act and the Higher Education
Amendment Act. They opposed and voted against the Education Laws Amendment
Bill of 2001.

I can go on and on, but in the interest of time, I wish to conclude that
they also voted against various other measures aimed at ensuring equality
and improving the quality of the education system. [Interjections.] The DP
and its leadership are not patriotic enough to identify with and contribute
towards the transformation process under way in our country.

It is obvious that their attitude, programme and strategy is to delay and
obstruct the transformation of the education system, to rubbish, belittle
and undermine any transformation effort by the Government. They will always
strive to maintain the status quo. However, their attempts to delay the
process of change, to enhance their political strategies at the expense of
the nation, are sure to meet with ignominious failure. South Africans will
definitely not tolerate opportunistic charlatans and demagogues for long.

The provision for the establishment of a representative council of learners
at every public school that enrols learners in the eighth grade and higher
in terms of the South African Schools Act, brought about the realisation,
after a long struggle by learners, of democracy and representivity at the
level of the public school. Most schools simply regard these structures as
a mechanism to provide learner representatives to school governing bodies.
The prefect system, in terms of which prefects are nominated by educators,
is in most instances still maintained and preferred to the democratically
elected council of learners.

The ANC supports the amendment to section 11 of the South African Schools
Act, which aims to make the representative council of learners, the only
recognised and legitimate body of learners at public schools because we
regard these structures as important to providing a coherent strategy to
promote leadership, accountability and democratic values among learners.
The amendments also give the MEC concerned authority to determine the
functions and procedures for the establishment of the council and the
election of members to the council. This will provide a uniform approach in
all public schools in a province and also ensure that the council takes its
rightful place in the school system.

These amendments are intended to remove any uncertainty and ambiguity that
existed as to how other learner structures should relate to the learner
representative council. Learner representative councils, as the hon the
Minister said, are legislative bodies that should represent the collective
views of and aspirations of learners.

We, therefore, support the position that they should not be seen as an
authority to themselves. They should contribute towards improving relations
among learners, between student organisations, and between learners and
educators, respect the authority of the school management, and mobilise
learners to support programmes and resolutions of the school governing
body. Among others, we expect them to play a leading role, together with
student organisations, in mobilising learners to respect and protect school
property.

As the ANC, we wish to encourage these structures to support ``operation
Mazibuye'' by encouraging fellow learners to return departmental books and
school property in their possession at the end of the school year. Their co-
operation with other stakeholders within the school and other community
organisations and organs of state, is critical to ensuring that learning
and teaching take place in a safe and clean environment that is free of
violence, intimidation, harassment and abuse of fellow learners,
particularly girls, and drugs as well as gangsterism. Representative
councils of learners should contribute towards the establishment of a
culture of learning and discipline among learners in their respective
schools.

As the ANC we have always maintained that whoever misuses resources meant
to alleviate the plight of our people is an enemy of the people. We are
serious about combating corruption, in this instance the misuse of school
fees by educators and school governing bodies. It is a pity that the
opposition condones these practices. [Interjections.] There was a point
earlier onÿ.ÿ.ÿ. [Interjections.] The hon members have just demonstrated
today that they do condone corruption and do not associate with the fight
to eliminate it. They were not interested.

There was a point earlier on made by the FF, the New NP, as well as the DP,
that these measures are being implemented simply because there is
corruption that relates to trust funds. We have never made the point that
we are simply amending this in order to deal with trust funds. We said that
if moneys are deposited into a school account, they should not be
transferred to trust funds because we expect that trust funds are meant to
mobilise resources for communities and ensure that those resources find
their way into the school, not vice versa.

As far as the hon Green is concerned, I do not think that he understands
what this is all about. The last time he brought a poster of human anatomy
here, which he called pornography. We call on the national association of
school governing bodies and all other role-players to join the Government
in fighting corruption, ignorance and abuse of children. The ANC supports
the Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, hon members, may I thank the
chairperson of the portfolio committee, the hon Prof Mayatula, who in his
very quiet, dignified and learned way, just like a good headmaster, has
corralled his committee. I am grateful for the work that he has done.

I am also grateful to those members of the committee who actually turned up
at the committee to debate these Bills. Not all the members turned up, but
that has not been a disqualification from pontificating at length on what
is not in the Bill.

I like Rev Douglas ... He looks like a reverend, does he not? [Laughter.] I
liked his statement about the nostalgic banalities that came up. But, I
will tell hon members why. I have sat here for seven years now, and I have
never heard the opposition, that is the New NP and DP, support any
progressive piece of legislation on education. Listen to their appalling
statements.

Mr Koornhof has pointed out that there are actually two worlds, whether one
likes it or not. [Interjections.] There is the world of privilege that the
hon member articulated, and the privilege comes out when one talks about
these trust funds. Because it is not the corruption that matters, but the
abuse of these funds. And I can give the hon members chapter and verse on
how these funds have been abused to send teachers on overseas rugby trips,
to buy cars for them and build extensions to principals' houses - all from
the trust fund - because of the fundamental matter that parents do not have
access to and control of the trust fund, as they do over the school funds.
We are trying to provide a remedy for a mischief.

And we must get rid of the idea that the ANC wants to centralise the funds.
[Interjections.] The hon Groenewald should know that we are not saying that
the school fees are, therefore, Government moneys. We are saying that
public moneys must stay in the school to be used by the parents.
[Interjections.]

The functions here are about the MECs of the provinces and the MECs of
provinces have agreed to this. They are not transferred to Pretoria. Let me
remind hon members that governing bodies appoint teachers. They decide on
the language of instruction and on the form of religious worship. These are
the ANC-led Government's proposals. Nowhere else in the world do governing
bodies have powers over these three enormous matters.

I am saying to the House that we have to evaluate this. We will have to
look at how this works. And the trouble with the opposition is that they
never once made a proposal, in education to say: Let us look at this
together collectively because something has gone wrong. There is a creative
aspect of the opposition which they have to recognise. [Interjections.] No!
No! My door is open. The hon member must not prattle here because they have
never made any concrete suggestion about a governing body. Every year we
review these things. We bring them before members.

And, of course, we must tell Boy Geldenhuys to get off his high horse. In
section 60 it says, ``the state is liable for any damage or loss caused as
a result of any act or omission''. [Interjections.] I challenge the hon
member to obtain legal advice to clarify this ambiguity - ``any act or
omission''. Mr Geldenhuys must come clean. He can use certain arguments for
debating purposes, which are dishonourable. I want to see his opinion
regarding my request to him to come clean on this because there is no
ambiguity. I am not listening to him. [Interjections.]
Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Mr Chairperson, is the hon the Minister prepared to take
a question? [Interjections.]

The MINISTER: Chairperson, no. The hon member, Boy must sit down because I
have to finish this. I think that he brings disrepute to debates. He does
not look at debates. He insulted the reverend from the IFP, because he does
not know how to debate against him, for he made sense.

I want to say that Mr Green is quite right. We need to assist governing
bodies. [Interjections.] This is the baying of wolves. Wolves have nothing
to say. Mr Green is right. We need to build up the governing bodies in the
rural areas where they are totally nonfunctioning. He came up with a benign
proposal here, and does he know what he must do? He needs to train the next
one, whereas one would have to remove the one that is not working in order
to bring about another one to work.

I am grateful to the comrades here, particularly two or three comrades, who
have actually made increasingly powerful interventions as to how we could
improve the education system. I regret to say that the speakers from the
opposition party have not added value to the debate. It is a pity, because
these are rather minor changes that we are bringing about. We look forward
to the fact that one day, apart from the ANC, the IFP and the other party's
benches, there will be truly national mobilisation in support of education
and its progress in this country. But, we still have to wait because these
yokels here do not understand a thing. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time (Democratic Party, New National Party Freedom
Front, African Christian Democratic Party and Federal Alliance dissenting).

      GENERAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING QUALITY ASSURANCE BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Mr Chairperson, I have pleasure in introducing
this Bill before the House. It brings about fundamental changes and
completes the whole reform process which was started in 1994.
[Interjections.]

The quality of education has become a priority area of focus for our
Ministry and department, after spending the first years of our democracy
establishing a single national education system in the country. Foreign
commentators have commented on the fact that one of the great revolutionary
things was to combine approximately 19 departments into one and the nine
provincial departments.

One of the instruments which we are currently using is systemic evaluation
of learner achievements, which will measure the progress of learners across
the country, at grades 3, 6 and 9. Again, we will be doing this for the
first time. This will ensure that we are able to measure the quality of
learning at an early stage, and not wait until the end of the 12 years
before picking up any problems.

Another instrument is the policy of evaluating the whole school, which I
have recently determined. This instrument will look at the functioning of a
school as an organisation, through an in-depth investigation by a team of
trained evaluators. They will look at what is actually happening in the
school - the teaching, the quality of teaching, the physical circumstances
and the whole tone or atmosphere in the school. I am looking forward to the
results of both these instruments, which I will make available to the
public and to this House to ensure accountability.

But, the above attempt to intervene in the process of schooling in order to
ensure that acceptable standards are being maintained along the way, is
only part of the process. The third leg of quality assurance relates to the
exit standards which are achieved. These are reflected in the final
examinations and their results.

Historically, we have made use of the SA Certification Council, Safcert,
which has certified the results of provincial matric examinations. This
council, particularly in the last four years, has done much to maintain
public confidence in the matric examinations. I must extend my appreciation
to it for the valuable work. But, we are expanding the boundaries of
quality assurance based on the view that this cannot be just a post facto
process after the events of certification. It should rather be a continuous
process which feeds quality imperatives back into the system. It is not
enough simply to monitor learning achievements. The aim must surely be to
improve these, and we know of the close relationship between the national
curriculum and the assessment system. They are very closely associated and
this, of course, is in the preamble of the Bill which I am tabling in order
to improve those systems.

So, we are, therefore, proposing, through this Bill, the establishment of a
new body which will replace Safcert and take responsibility for the quality
assurance of institutional programmes in the general and further education
bands of the National Qualifications Framework. This proposal is based on
extensive international research and thorough consultation. The new body
will, in future, recognise learner achievements and award qualifications,
certificates or credits towards a National Qualification Framework
qualification.

Its scope will be limited to programmes offered by institutions
established, declared or registered under the South African Schools Act,
the Further Education and Training Act or the Adult Basic Education and
Training Act. In other words, it will not include higher education. It will
also not affect other quality assurers or processes in regard to programmes
offered outside these institutions. In addition, the new body will have the
power to delegate and assign any of its duties to other bodies with the
capacity to assist, while remaining primarily responsible for quality
assurance in the two bands.

The sector education and training authorities, Setas, are very important
bodies and will, therefore, continue to play a quality assurance role in
respect of programmes offered by employers and training agencies within
their own economic sectors. The SA Qualifications Authority will maintain
oversight of quality assurance structures and processes across all bands of
the National Qualification Network.

One of the major tasks of the new body will be the accreditation of both
public and private providers. Once criteria have been established, all
general and further education providers, including provincial departments
of education, will be compelled to comply with such criteria, or face
sanctions. In the case of a provincial department, the education MEC will
be required to give a detailed report to the Minister on why they have not
done so, and in the case of a private provider their accreditation will be
withdrawn. This is very important, because at the further education and
training level, there are thousands of providers of education who have not
been regulated up to now.

In higher education, in the past three years we have had a satisfactory
form of accreditation and recognition and, therefore, of regulation and
control. Of course, hon members know of horror stories that take place of
people who are writing certificate examinations which are not recognised
anywhere, particularly at the level of ICT. Therefore, it is important that
all private providers of education in the provinces must be registered, so
that parents who are spending thousands and thousands of rands are not
taken for a ride. These are very powerful instruments which are strongly in
the interests of the public.

The new body, unfortunately, is designated as the General and Further
Education and Training Quality Assurance Council, an accurate but rather
lengthy description of its function. We had a competition, and we offered
money to find a better title for this body, but the Genfetqa Council seems
to be the only one that is available.

So, if the House approves of this Bill, I will further invite nominations
from organisations involved in education, from which I will appoint 15
persons, including the chairperson. These appointments will take into
account, of course, professionalism, knowledge of education, representivity
in the sector, expertise and experiences of different nominees. I must be
clear: I want maximum participation, but an efficient professional body,
not one which will end up tied up in petty- political bickering over
unrelated issues which gives itself large amounts of money as expenses for
attending these meetings.

I believe that the country is more than ready for the rigours of a systemic
quality assurance programme. We have been improving examination results
over the past year and we have to do so again this year. These achievements
have been the result of an uncompromising stance on the commitment of
teachers and officials through close monitoring of the outcomes. The
Genfetqa council, if approved, will be another tool which will prepare our
education system and learners for the 21st century, as I promised the
President on taking office.

I am delighted to record that except for minor amendments, all the
provinces, at this time, have indicated their support for the draft
legislation. In recognition of its purpose and ability to improve quality
in education, as the Department of Education together with the provincial
departments, we are placing ourselves before the public, and establishing a
structure which will report to them on our performance. This is a brave
move but we owe it to the public. We are confident that in working with
this council we will continue to improve the quality of education at
general and further levels. [Applause.]

Mr R S NTULI: Chairperson, hon Minister and colleagues, I think that I must
preface my speech with some remarks to highlight the fact that when we come
to the podium, this sacrosanct place, we should treat it with respect. When
we make remarks, they must be completely truthful. It is not true that the
DP opposes all the Bills.

The first time I came to this podium, I spearheaded the DP's support of the
South African Council for Educators Bill. I can go on giving other
examples. [Interjections.] We do not oppose for the sake of opposition, and
it must be clear that we are supportive of transformation without any
qualification, but we are concerned that it must move in the right
direction. [Interjections.] Having said that, I want to point out that this
is another Bill which we are going to support. [Applause.]

The quality assurance is currently done in terms of the South African
Certification Council Act of 1986. As this Act emanates from the time of
the apartheid government, some of its provisions are outdated and the
language used is neither gender-friendly nor user-friendly.

The new Act will apply to all education institutions that are below the
band of higher education. The Bill aims to provide for the establishment of
a quality assurance body. This body will ensure quality in the delivery and
outcomes of the two bands with which it is primarily concerned. It also
aims to regulate the relationship between the Department of Education, the
SA Qualifications Authority and other education and training quality
assurance bodies provided for in the council.

The aim of this Bill, among other things, is to outline the functions of
this body. They include the following: to accredit general and further
education and training providers; to monitor the suitability and adequacy
of standards and qualifications; to assure the quality of learner
assessment at exit points; to recognise learner achievements and award
qualifications and credits toward qualification; to issue certificates of
learner achievements; and to co-operate with relevant bodies appointed to
moderate quality assurance against specific standards or qualifications.

The functions of providers and assessment bodies regarding external
assessment are stipulated in clause 18. They include taking measures - this
is critical - to combat irregularities at the assessment and marking
centres and making sure that assessment is representative of the prescribed
subject matter.

The good intention of clause 18 is given more muscle by clause 21 which
empowers the council to refuse to issue a certificate of assessment where
necessary. The council can also cancel a certificate if a learner has not
met the requirements for qualification. The Bill further states that
persons who do not comply shall be found guilty of an offence and liable to
a fine or imprisonment.

The DP has pleasure in supporting this Bill. [Applause.]

Ms E GANDHI: Comrade Chairperson, Comrade Minister, comrades and
colleagues, in supporting this Bill, I want to say with pride at the outset
that the ANC Government has, since coming into power, recognised the
centrality of education to the development of our communities and our
country.

The education budget has grown and remains among the largest allocations.
For over 300 years, there has been a systematic imposition of an education
for service for the black people of this country. In seven years, it is
difficult to change and transform those indoctrinated over decades.

This Bill, among other things, seeks to ensure that the quality of our
education is transformed from apartheid education to an education for the
empowerment of the people. The annual report says, and I quote:


  Central to the development of the quality assurance policy, is the
  establishment of an education and training quality assurance body for the
  general and further education and training bands, including Abet and
  early childhood development.

The department has begun the legislative process that will establish the
education and training quality assurance body towards the end of 2001, that
is this Bill. The functions of this council will be to accredit providers,
that is to make sure that providers of education are able to provide
quality education. It will also monitor and audit education and training
achievements and system in terms of national qualifications and standards.

In order to do this, the council will ensure that providers adopt quality
management systems. The council will, in addition, have the power to issue
certificates of learner achievements in line with the National
Qualifications Framework. In order to ensure that the standards are
maintained, it will also have to assure the quality of learner assessment
at exit points and promote quality improvement among providers.

In addition to this, clause 18 provides for the functions of an assessment
body regarding external assessment. This also includes the taking of
measures to combat irregularities at the assessment and marking centres and
making sure that assessment is representative of the prescribed subject
matter.

For too long our children have been exploited by fly-by-night schools. The
measures that the council will put into place and the powers that it will
have will certainly provide protection for our children. The emphasis in
this Bill is on quality control and how it will enhance the general and
further education and training system and protect people from being
exploited.

Whilst there were no specific provisions for representivity on the previous
council, the council set up by this Bill will be representative and
appointed through a participative process. The Minister, as he has already
said, will advertise for nominations, and the public can then nominate
persons they consider to be suitable. The Minister will then appoint
councillors from this list of nominees - there are set criteria for this
purpose. With this council in place, we can be sure that our education
system can only improve and produce the men and women we need for the
development of this country, and certificates which have meaning and are
respected.
I just want to make one suggestion to the Minister and that is that our
vision is, and I quote from the annual report:


  Our vision is of a South Africa in which all our people have access to
  lifelong education.

I want to suggest that it be a quality lifelong education. [Applause.]

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Chairperson, I want to thank the Minister for conferring
the title of ``Reverend'' on me. Maybe this will assist in making the
comments made by Boy Geldenhuys a little more polite.

The vision to change the education landscape, which I have mentioned in my
earlier deliberation, is given further impetus with the tabling of the
General and Further Education and Training Quality Assurance Bill,
Genfetqa. Indeed, there is not much economy in this short title, Genfetqa,
but one is sure it is African and, in particular, South African, if one
thinks of Namaqua, Outeniqua, Griqua, Qwaqwa and KwaZulu.

Genfetqa was necessitated by the fact that SAQA dates back to days gone by.
It has done its fair share, but there are some flaws we have inherited and
some inequalities. Remarks by MEC Helen Zille that this certification will
lead to a lowering of standards and will not be worth the paper it is
written on, are really of the lowest level. We are grappling with mud
politics. I call this consternation for transformation. While I was sitting
there, I wrote something for Boy Geldenhuys. I got confused in that I did
not whether he is Boy or baas or baasboy. So, I thought I would write
something for him in Afrikaans. It goes something like this:

Diagnose vir Baas Boy. Hy suffer van konsternasie vir transformasie, want
sy apartheidbagasie benodig purgasie vir die vooruitgang van ons nuwe
nasie. [Gelag.] [Diagnosis for Baas Boy. He is suffering from consternation
for transformation, because his apartheid luggage is in need of purgation
for the betterment of our new nation. [Laughter.]]

Genfetqa is an instrument that looks at a school's functioning as a
coherent organisation and monitors that standards are not only established
but also maintained. To quote the Minister, it is indeed true that the
quality assurance cannot be a post facto process of certification but a
continuous process which feeds quality and imperatives back into the
system.

Whilst the criteria of the Bill are used for accreditation for private and
public providers, including provincial departments, criteria for
accreditation need some acceleration to avoid immediate lacunas and
confusion and to deal effectively and quickly with fly-by-night computer
schools and other institutions that we see mushrooming these days.

The IFP believes and trust that the chairperson of this envisaged council
will be elected on merit only. The IFP is concerned about section 23 of the
Bill and hopes that there will be no need for trepidation on the possible
capacity problem that may arise here because most schools have been filled
with trepidation.

We had many overtures by independent schools, the Pestalozzis and home
schoolers, who tried to slip into the process their concerns on religious
adherence. On Tuesday, we had marches and those marchers accused the hon
the Minister of lying. I was worried because I read about one placard which
said ``Lying is the prerogative of the Government, just as giving medicines
is of the physicians''. I did not study the placard. I just read about it
recently. I do not want to sound like Mark Anthony or Brutus, but our
esteemed Minister is an honourable man.

Even Karl Marx made the following remarks. He said that commodity-producing
societies are societies where labour products do not become commodities
whereas socialist governments had a deliberate production of social and
moral values for others, which is wholly owned by the state and the state
only to serve the conscience of the state and not the nation. Here, again,
the Government is accused of unrealistic application of humanism. But, our
Minister is an honourable man.

Allow me to go further. The impression is being created that Christian
children shall be fed a diet of Voltaire and that the Bible is an ancient
relic of superstition that belongs to dusty museums. Let me go even further
than that. They give the impression that Muslim children will be made to
recite The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie. The Jewish community is also
filled with trepidation because they get the impression that they will be
forced into incorporating into their personality structure Sergei Nilus's
Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

The IFP supports the Bill.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, the previous speaker is a poet, and he does
not know it. Before I deal with this Bill, let me just go back to clause 61
of the previous Bill. The person who proposed that clause 61 ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, we are dealing with Bill
57B-2001 and not the previous one. Please deal with this Bill.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Then we will continue this debate at another time.

Die wetsontwerp onder bespreking maak onder meer voorsiening vir 'n raad
vir gehalteversekering vir algemene en verdere onderwys en opleiding, wat
die ou senior sertifiseringsraad sal vervang. Die raad moet nou
kwaliteitonderrig in die openbare en private sektore verseker. Die sleutel
tot gehalteonderwys in die klaskamer is nie soseer die aantal
kwaliteitsversekeringsliggame nie, maar wel toegewyde en goedopgeleide
onderwysers. Die heropleiding van die 85 000 ongekwalifiseerde of
ondergekwalifiseerde onderwysers durf as 'n saak van dringende prioriteit
nie langer uitgestel word nie.

Die Nuwe NP ondersteun die wetsontwerp, maar wil tog die volgende onder die
agb Minister se aandag bring. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[The Bill before us provides, inter alia, for a quality assurance board for
general and further education and training, which will replace the old
senior certification board. This board must now assure quality tuition in
the public and private sectors. The key to quality education in the
classroom is not so much the number of quality assurance boards, but rather
dedicated and well-trained teachers. Retraining the 85 000 unqualified or
underqualified teachers, as a matter of urgent priority, dare no longer be
postponed.

The New NP supports the Bill, but would still like to bring the following
to the Minister's attention.]

In terms of clause 23(1), every private provider or school must apply for
accreditation. Now, there are approximately 2 000 independent schools and
more or less the same number of other private providers whose application
for accreditation might take months or perhaps even years to be approved. A
possible solution is that these independent schools associations, in any
case, quality assure their members, and then be deemed to be accredited
initially, as is the case with provincial education departments. Another
area of concern is the fees charged for services by the council in terms of
clause 13(1).

Now, not all independent schools are rich. There are many poorly resourced
private schools which are nevertheless providing good education and
training to learners from poor communities. These communities will not be
able to afford high fees charged for services by the council. Therefore, we
suggest that consultation with private schools in determining such fees be
seriously considered.

Ons ondersteun die wetsontwerp. [We support the Bill.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, Minister of Education and members, the UDM
supports the General and Further Education and Training Quality Assurance
Bill, 2001. The Bill, amongst other things, seeks to provide for the
establishment of a General and Further Education and Training Quality
Assurance Council, to provide for the composition and functions of the
council, to provide for the conduct of assessment, and to provide for the
repeal of the South African Certification Council. The council, which is a
juristic person, is deemed to be accredited by the SA Qualifications
Authority as an education and training quality assurance body, primarily
responsible for quality assurance and further education and training at
education institutions.

Should the council fail to comply substantially with accreditation
requirements for an education and training quality assurance body, the SA
Qualifications Authority must give the council timeframes within which it
must comply with the criteria. Failure to comply is reported to the
Minister who must request the chairperson of the council to give a detailed
report on why the council has not complied with the criteria.

The Council consists of 15 members appointed by the Minister, who also
appoints one of the members as a chairperson. The UDM holds the view that
whether the chairperson of the council is appointed by the Minister or is
elected by the council from among the members, the position should be
purely on merit.

The deputy chairperson is elected by members from amongst their number. The
council may establish one or more committees which may perform such
functions of the council as the council may determine. The chairperson of
such committee is appointed by the council from among its members. The
council must have a chief executive officer who is appointed by the
Minister on the recommendation of the members of the council. The chief
executive officer is accountable to the council.

With the council meeting the criteria for accreditation and performing the
functions of education and training quality assurance for general and
further education and training in respect of the National Qualifications
Framework, the country is assured of quality education and training for
all. The UDM hopes that the leaks of examination papers will be a thing of
the past.

Mr L M GREEN: Mr Chairperson, in principle, we approve of the view that
there should be a national council to ensure that national standards are
maintained. We do, however, have concerns that were raised by Christian
organisations such as the Pestalozzi Trust, and other organisations.

I can assure the hon member Mr Douglas that it is not because those people
just want to pick a fight with the Minister, but it is because of
legitimate concerns. One of the concerns that they have raised, and which I
want to raise here today, is that there is no comparable protection
provided in this Bill for the psychological integrity, the human dignity
and the privacy of learners in any of the educational laws we have, even
though these rights are recognised in the Constitution in equal or greater
measure, and even though South Africa is bound by the UN Convention on the
Rights of the Child to give effect to those rights in legislation in equal
or greater measure compared to the right to be protected against corporal
punishment.

We remember the debate we had about corporal punishment. Our position is
that we cannot understand, when it comes to the prohibition of offence to
human dignity and the invasion of privacy ... [Time expired.]
Mr I S MFUNDISI: Mr Chairperson and hon members, the South African
Certification Council has done good work in its tenure, but changes have to
be brought in so that a new body is responsible for establishing education
and training standards or qualifications for the affected levels.

The council will have a measure of autonomy as it will receive allocations
from Parliament while it will be at liberty to receive donations and
contributions, and also charge fees for services. The council will have to
introduce measures to combat irregularities at the assessment and marking
centres, and ensure that examinations cover the entire subject matter, as
prescribed.

At the moment, we notice that the credibility of the Grade 12 examinations
is at stake. It is particularly so with the five subjects that are being
examined nationally. Where are the cracks that let examination papers leak?
We call on the department to put in place a council that will be vigilant
and ensure that integrity in external examinations is not compromised.

We welcome provincial education departments being regarded as having been
accredited by the council and hope that the council will consider their
accreditation of private providers speedily and fairly. The UCDP supports
the Bill. [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Mr Chairperson, our country, like the rest of Africa, needs
a massive and radical educational programme. We must maximise the study of
modern science and technology in all our institutions of learning. These
are the two factors which generate economic power. As Francois Partant has
put it:


  It is technological economic power that determines the places of nations
  in the world.

It is in this context that the PAC welcomes the General and Further
Education and Training Quality Assurance Bill.

Any effort which promotes knowledge must be appreciated. Education is the
acquisition of knowledge. Knowledge liberates a nation. The PAC supports
this Bill but hopes that more institutions of learning will be opened
instead of being massively closed down, as has happened especially in the
Eastern Cape.

How can colleges be closed down when the population is growing? This
country must aim at being self-sufficient in education. We cannot import
mathematics teachers forever where there are no teachers, while there are
teachers who can be trained to teach mathematics in this country, instead
of being retrenched while foreign teachers take their jobs. [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, with the past inequalities in education
and other services which were provided on the basis of colour, the new
Government was challenged to correct these injustices, which is by no means
an easy task.

In terms of our Constitution, which is our supreme governing authority, all
persons have a right to education. It is our duty to deliver. The General
and Further Education and Training Quality Assurance Bill is aimed at
enabling the Department of Education to bring consistency in quality
assurance and assessment in the country, ie education being delivered, and
its standards and means and quality of deliverance.

The ability to keep a check on this via a monitoring process certainly
gives an air of confidence as to the standard of education delivered.
Having the policy in place and the ability to deliver requires the means to
activate this to the best of its abilities, ie with reference to educators
and teachers that are skilled in the profession to ensure effective
delivery.

The MF supports the General and Further Education and Training Quality
Assurance Bill. [Applause.]

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER: Mr Chairperson, as far as the General and Further
Education and Training Quality Assurance Bill is concerned, everyone has
agreed that it has had a smooth passage through the Education Portfolio
Committee on Education.

During the public hearings that were held on this Bill, there was also
general agreement amongst the various stakeholders that there was a
legitimate need for a quality assurance body for the general and further
education and training bands. And, during the deliberations on the Bill in
the Portfolio Committee on Education the various parties were generally at
one about the need for a quality assurance body to monitor and audit
education and training achievements in terms of national standards and
qualifications. The establishment of a quality assurance council,
therefore, to provide for control over norms and standards of curriculum
and assessment, was generally accepted by all.

Dit was duidelik dat alle rolspelers, die onderskeie politieke partye
inkluis, dit eens was dat ons 'n beheerliggaam nodig gehad het wat
standaarde sou bepaal en monitor in soverre dit die kurrikulum en die
evaluering van die werk van leerlinge aanbetref. Almal wil hulle seker
daarop roem dat hulle staan vir standaarde in die onderwys en dat hulle nie
enigsins met minderwaardige prestasies in die klaskamer te doen wil hê nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[It was clear that all role-players, including the various political
parties, agreed that we needed a controlling body which would determine and
monitor standards as far as the curriculum and evaluation of the work of
pupils was concerned. verybody probably wants to boast that they stand for
standards in education and that they want nothing to do with inferior
performances in the classroom.]

However, when it dawned on certain right-wing groups that have already been
named in this Chamber that the envisaged council would be tasked with
developing criteria for accreditation to which all provincial education
departments had to adhere, including all other providers and assessment
bodies, then a new desperation set in. This desperation was now not focused
on the quality assurance council per se, but on the fact that compliance
would be demanded by the council to the standards set by the curriculum. It
was at this point that the various fundamentalist groupings, who were
battling the Minister of Education on the national curriculum statement,
shifted their gaze to the General and Further Education and Training
Quality Assurance Bill for redemption.

All the different parties were then inundated with faxes and telephone
calls, as it has become the custom of the particular pressure group, urging
all of us to consider some kind of amendment to this Bill in order to
regulate the assessment of the curriculum to the extent of preventing what
was called intrusive practices into the curriculum. There was a discussion
in the committee about that. From our side, as the ANC, we acknowledged, in
the formal stage of that discussion, that we had been approached by these
groups to bring about some kind of prohibition to the assessment of what
these groups refer to as intrusive practices.

However, the position that the ANC stated in that meeting was that it was
not the intention of this particular General and Further Education and
Training Quality Assurance Bill to address the content of the national
curriculum statement. Rather, it was the intention of the Bill to establish
a council which would ensure that whatever the curriculum, all general and
further education institutions that were either declared or registered in
terms of education legislation would have to abide by the criteria laid
down in the curriculum.

As far as I can recall, all other parties agreed in that meeting that this
Bill was not legislating on the curriculum, and as a portfolio committee we
could not consider any amendment proposed to the content of the curriculum.
It therefore comes as a surprise to me to hear in this debate this
afternoon Mr Green saying that the Bill does not provide protection to
learners with regard to the curriculum when he agreed in the portfolio
committee to the view that this Bill was not addressing the aspect which
these people wanted it to address.

There are other forums and other policy documents in which the Government
and the Department of Education give adequate opportunity to those who have
reservations about the national curriculum statement. On Tuesday the
Ministry of Education held public hearings in which the Minister patiently
and without interruption listened to all the views of the various
stakeholders with regard to the content of the national curriculum
statement.

Our democratic laws allow those opposed to Government policies to hold
peaceful marches to Parliament as various of these groups indeed did on
Tuesday. This courtesy, or should I say this fundamental human right, was
not allowed under apartheid rule, because any dissension like they showed
on Tuesday would have been ruthlessly crushed by the then apartheid
government.

The ANC does not have a problem with dissenting views being expressed
towards the various policies which they adopt in the interest of
transformation. However, the ANC has an even greater responsibility towards
the majority of the people in our nation who concur with the approach that
policies, Bills and Acts would have to be in line with transforming an
undemocratic and authoritarian society, and would have to take into
consideration the undeniable fact that South Africa is a multicultural and
diverse society in which a multitude of religions and lifestyles compete
for recognition.

Therefore, the policies of Government have to be in line with the demands
of diversity rather than conforming to the constraints of exclusivity. In
so far as this Bill ensures that order and discipline are established in
the domain of the presentation and the assessment of the agreed curriculum,
whatever the nature of that curriculum may be, we believe that it
represents another building block in the establishment of a democratic
order in which all of the diverse demands of a multiracial, multicultural
and multireligious education system are successfully accommodated.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, I have had a pained letter from Mr
Lee of the DP saying that he was awaiting my response to their support of
the Bill with bated breath. Can I ask him to unbate his breath? My response
is that I greet this like I would greet snow in Cape Town in summer or a
cobra sliding out of my pants. I greet this with all the enthusiasm of a
cobra coming out of my pants. [Laughter.]

Can I, therefore, thank the DP for their support. I never said that the DP
opposes all the Bills. I said that to my knowledge they oppose every
progressive piece of legislation. [Interjections.] I said that and Hansard
will bear that out. I would like to thank them for that.

I think that this is the combination of a process that began in 1996, the
culmination to bring together and integrate all education factors,
particularly assessment. We have always said, let me reiterate, we want
equity and fairness, and quality with it too. We do not want to choose
between quality and equity, and equity and quality. That is why it is so
important, and there will be some great surprises where we now have a
system for assessment of higher education.
Therefore, for benchmarking against the rest of the world, we get some
surprising results when we see the quality assessment carried out at
different levels of higher education. Members will be very surprised. We
want quality and equity. Therefore, can I say to Dr Geldenhuys that
thousands of schools come for assessment. We cannot assess them all at
once. It will take them three or four years to be assessed. That is the
correct thing to do.

Fees are being charged; ultimately the budget has to come to me. If in
terms of the budget the fees are too high, I have the right to say that I
do not accept it. I think there is a gap there. I think the rises in fees
should not have taken place without some kind of regulator, and the
regulator could have been the Minister for the time being. So, there is a
gap which, I think, we will have to correct next year.

The third thing concerns what Dr Pheko said. We are not closing down
institutions. We have had a large number of inefficient institutions. Now
we are trying to professionalise them. I do not think that the
antiforeigner thing should work in this House. Most of our technikons are
staffed by overseas people, from formerly eastern Europe, because we do not
have technically qualified people in South Africa. We should not go on with
this xenophobia here in this most august place to say that foreigners
should keep out.

Finally, regarding values, the fundamental values are laid down in the
South African Schools Act. The fundamental values will carry throughout
every part of our national curriculum statement. If hon members have the
South African Schools Act, they should look at it very carefully. As Mr Van
der Heever said, we shall use the extraordinary strength, richness and
diversity against the bigoted uniformity that some people in this House
would like to impose on us, in the faith and morals part of it.

We will combat them on that, and we will reply to every point raised,
including the one that Grade 12 pupils have to be involved in oral sex in
classroom, which is the so-called evidence given to us on Tuesday. We will
reply to every demonising of the democratic tradition in our country,
rather than to destroy all that we have achieved in the five years, so that
everybody in South Africa could feel comfortable. If they do not feel
comfortable at the school then the school is betraying them.
We will not allow the hon member's disgraceful essay to make foreigners of
our people in our own schools in South Africa. Therefore, the Bill will
help in ensuring that we have the kind of quality control that can allow
better students to achieve better results in South Africa for a better
South Africa altogether. [Applause.]

                         ANIMAL IDENTIFICATION BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Chairperson, hon members,
the Bill we are discussing in this House today is not about identifying new
animal species that were not in existence, as other members might have
thought. It is merely about the marking of our livestock. Interestingly,
however, we are, in this Bill, creating a framework of marking other
animals such as pets and wildlife, which did not fall under the Livestock
Brands Act of 1962. Just after 1994, we ensured that all other magisterial
districts that were not covered by the Livestock Brands Act of 1962,
particularly those which fall under the homeland areas and self-governing
territories, were actually brought in line.

The livestock industry is very important for our country's economy. It is
also one sector where it is easy to find those farmers who were previously
disadvantaged. For our rural households, livestock are an important asset.
The majority of our people here in this House and others outside this House
have been beneficiaries of a situation where households sold livestock in
order to pay school fees for them to attain their education. For rural and
urban communities, the livestock industry also provides for essential
nutrition and food security in general. For the majority of livestock
farmers, this industry is a lifeline of their revenue and thereby a source
of their livelihood. The benefits from value addition in this industry are
also enormous, particularly in the use of skins and hides for leather bags,
car seats and many others that I cannot mention today.

Like any other industry, livestock farming has had its own challenges such
as stock theft and infectious animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth
disease. The many legal instruments that are there to deal with some of
these challenges need review at some stage or another. This is done in
order to strengthen or correct some of the anomalies that do not fit the
current times. The current legislation has come as a result of the review
undertaken by various stakeholders both within South Africa and also in the
Southern African Development Community in the region.

Stock theft has been a challenge for ourselves, as governments in the
region, and farmers. Farmers of KwaZulu-Natal, the Free State and the
Eastern Cape have been the most affected by stock theft. The trans-boundary
action of the SAPS and the role that Foreign Affairs has played - one must
commend them - has tried to help to recover some of these animals that find
their way into other countries in the region. However, it must be noted
that we still face this challenge. We are therefore endeavouring through
this Bill to help lessen this illegal trade in some way.

Through this Bill, we are creating an opportunity that all our livestock
are marked in a manner that ensures that the value of the income on skins
and hides is not lost. Secondly, we want to ensure that traceability is
possible, even for the animals that have not reached the age of fourteen
days. Thirdly, it will help us to monitor the movement of animals for
disease control purposes, but also to curb the issue of cattle rustling. I
say this because we have agreed with my counterparts in the region that
this legislation was not only necessary for South Africa or for some, but
it was necessary for all of us.

In the SADC meeting of agricultural and natural resources Ministers, there
was an agreement that various legislatures in the region should pass an
Animal Identification Bill so that we are able to deal with the problem of
stock theft and animal disease. The Bill also provides a framework for
registration of markers in order to protect the public against
inexperienced markers.

I must say the journey to arrive where we are today has been a long one.
Consultations were held with farmers, both commercial and resource-poor
farmers in traditional areas. Given that agriculture has a concurrent
function, enormous time was also given to the provinces in order to consult
further with other stakeholders and give some input into the Bill.
Another important phase has been the role that has been played by our
public representatives here in Parliament in the portfolio committee. I
wish to thank hon members, particularly those in the portfolio committee,
for the work that they have done in ensuring that the Bill is strengthened
and is tabled for debate today. I wish to thank Dr Moepudi and the team in
the department for their hard work. More importantly, it is necessary for
me to thank the various stakeholders for their input and the way in which
they helped us to identify some of the problems in the current Livestock
Branding Act. I trust that this product, which this Parliament will pass,
is not only going to be our product, but is going to be the product of the
industry. [Applause.]

Nks B M NTULI: Mhlalingaphambili, aboNgqongqotjhe namalunga

[Mrs B M NTULI: Chairperson, Ministers and hon members, the Bill that we
are discussing today should have been implemented long ago. It is important
and long overdue. I will address myself to different topics in this Bill.
Firstly, it is important that all people who have animals should mark them,
whether one has two beasts or 200 is not important. According to this Bill
all animals should be marked according to the owner's identification mark.
This is what we call enforced marking. So I appeal to people if they hear
that animals are being marked, they must not be surprised, they must heed
the call because there will be a free marking period. After some time a
certain amount will have to be paid for that. So let people come if such an
announcement is made.

Secondly, our farmers should have a national identification mark of our
country, especially big farmers. A mark should exist for South Africa,
Namibia, Zimbabwe and other countries. This helps in identifying animals
from other countries easily, and this will help us to identify them when
there are diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, so that we know that in
such a country there is a disease and do not allow their animals to enter
our country. Also, when animals are stolen we will be able to identify
those animals because of the marking and will be able to impound them.

Thirdly, it is not everyone who has a right to make markings. There will be
people designated for that job which will be called marking operators.
Those people will be paid, but there will be a period to help people to
have a mark. The marking operators should also have a register of markings
so that if they mark one's cattle they should know the number, to whom it
belongs and where the owner resides, because a number of people will go
around and claim to be marking operators only for people to find out that
they are bogus. Fourthly, it will be simple to know exactly to whom the
animals belong or to identify the owner. There will be a time to mark the
animals so that they can be identified and know where they belong. The
marking operators should have a register so that they can write down the
owner of the cattle, the numbers and location of the owner.

This will make the work of the police officials simpler. Police will be
able to stop a truck carrying cattle and be able to identify the owner of
those cattle, where they are taken to and on whose authority, because they
will be marked with a marking that the owner has chosen for himself, as
well as with a national identification mark and a permit to transport those
cattle. Also what is important is that when such cattle have been lost it
is simple to identify them, ascertain that these animals do not belong to
our country and identify the owner.

Let me end by saying that if an accident were to take place on a national
road and it is not known whose cattle caused the accident, with these
markings it will be simple for traffic officials to find the rightful owner
of these cattle so that he can face the justice system. We are saying: Take
care of your animals, repair broken fences, do not remove them to build
your own kraal fences at home.]

Bakithi imfuyo yilona bhange lethu thina bantu abampisholo. Asiyinakekele
sibe negugu ngayo. Yimpilo yethu leyo. Noma ziyingcosana izinkomo zethu
ngoba sathathelwa ngabahlakaniphileyo ngezindlela eziphansi basenza
sabampofu obaba babe ngamadoda. Ngesikithi kuthiwa indoda yindoda ngesibaya
sayo. Sisho njalo ukuze sikwazi ukubambisana nomnyango wezolimo mayelana
nobusela nezifo senze njengoba umnyango usicela. (Translation of Zulu
paragraph follows.)

[To us black people, livestock farming is our bank. Let us protect it and
be proud of it. It is our life, although today we have few cattle because
those who are clever, took them from us in a deceitful way and made us poor
while our fathers were men. According to our culture, a man is a man
according to the number of cattle he has. That is what we are saying, so
that we can co-operate with the Department of Agriculture regarding
livestock thieves and diseases, as the department has requested us to do.]

Bagaetsho, ke tlile go kopa gore batho kwa magaeng ba leke go tshwaya
dikgomo tsa bona gore mapodisi a kgone go ba thusa go di batla fa di
timetse, le go thibela malwetse le bogodu. Re lapisitswe ke magodu le gore
batho ba itirele boithatelo ka leruo la rona. (Translation of Setswana
paragraph follows.)

[I would like to ask people in the rural areas to brand their livestock so
that the police can help them if they happen to lose them, to prevent
diseases and stock theft. We have had enough of people doing as they please
and stealing our livestock.]

Mr G B BHENGU: Chairperson, Minister and the honourable House, we are,
indeed, delighted as the IFP that the Department of =Agriculture has
introduced this Bill, which has been thoroughly scrutinised by the
portfolio committee, with the aim of promoting animal health and
controlling animal diseases. This country and some parts of the SADC
region, as well as some European countries, experienced an outbreak of foot-
and-mouth disease. Although this outbreak was a catch-22 situation, the
department was able to see it through.

The IFP welcomes the contemplated designation of a departmental
veterinarian who shall become the national executive officer to consider
applications for extensions, render advice on animal health, and carry out
examinations on animals and inspections on land and premises with regard to
animal health issues. These checks and balances will, indeed, promote
animal health and plug any loopholes with regard to the outbreak and spread
of diseases.

The restriction on the importation and exportation of animals, or things,
will surely contribute to the control of diseases and the promotion of
animal health. Moreover, these restrictions will curtail stock theft, which
is a thorn in the flesh of farmers and stock owners. We believe, in this
regard, that branding will also play a pivotal role in preventing stock
theft. The issuing of health certificates to animal exporters and permits
to importers is a positive step, and a holistic approach to all envisaged
problems.

The IFP applauds the provision, on the part of the Minister, to establish
animal health schemes as and when it becomes necessary to do so. Life
experiences have, indeed, shown that preventive measures are more effective
than curative ones. We appreciate the fact that the establishment of such
schemes is done according to very comprehensive guidelines. We realise that
this process will never be a slipshod exercise because of the magnitude of
problems and the after-effects of the outbreak and spread of animal
diseases.

Concerning the disposal of stray animals that pose no threat of disease, we
wish to point out that the two-day period allowed by the national executive
officer, in terms of this Bill, to restore on request the stray animal to
the owner may be too short. Some animals may stray because they have been
stolen in a very remote area and dumped in another for some reason. For
example, the thieves might have noticed a roadblock or may have experienced
a vehicle breakdown. Stock owners believe in looking for the lost animal
for up to a week or more before they actually give up the search.

Lastly, we believe that branding of animals plays a significant role in
combating stock theft. [Time expired.]

Mnr A S VAN DER MERWE: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Minister en lede van die
Raad, dit is tydig dat hierdie wet, wet 87 van 1962, verander word. Hierdie
wetsontwerp het ten doel om byvoorbeeld 'n boervriendelike wet daar te
stel. Dit het ten doel om met praktiese probleme van die vorige wet te
handel. Ek kry die indruk dat die opstellers van die wetsontwerp baie
moeite gedoen het om alle aspekte deeglik in ag te neem, en daarvoor het
ons baie waardering.

Wetsontwerp 49 van 2001 het 'n paar belangrike komponente, maar die
Minister en vorige sprekers het dit volledig gedek. Ek wil tog die volgende
uitlig: dit poog om mee te help om diefstal te ontmoedig. Vir 'n veeboer is
diefstal 'n groot probleem. Diewe steel nie graag gemerkte vee nie.

Dit is egter jammer dat die veediefstaleenhede afgeskaf is. Hierdie
wetsontwerp moet help om veediefstal teen te werk, maar dan skaf ons 'n
spesialiseenheid soos die veediefstaleenhede af. Hierdie eenhede was baie
suksesvol met die bekamping van veediefstal. Selfs potslagters was onder
beheer. Ek weet dit ressorteer nie direk onder die agb Minister nie, maar
ons hoop die Minister van Veiligheid en Sekuriteit hoor dit ook.

Veediefstal-ondersoeke verg 'n gespesialiseerde kennis. Hierdie kennis het
nou verlore geraak in die opname van die betrokke personeel in die totale
SAPD. Dit is 'n verlies vir die landbou. Met die veediefstaleenhede en die
beleid van die SAPD om so spoedig moontlik geld te bestee om potslagters
skuldig te bevind te kry weg, het hierdie element feitlik 'n vrypas om te
slag soos hulle lus het.

Dit is darem nie die boere se plig om honger mense op hierdie wyse van kos
te voorsien nie. Dit is die totale verantwoordelikheid van die staat om om
te sien na mense sonder kos. Daar moet kennis geneem word van die feit dat
die meeste potslagters slag om geld te verdien en nié omdat hulle honger is
nie.

Hierdie wetsontwerp maak dit moontlik om verskeie wyses van identifikasie
te gebruik om onder meer 'n mens se diere op wettige wyses te kan
identifiseer. Soos meer gesofistikeerde metodes beskikbaar en bekostigbaar
word, kan die eienaars van diere dit toepas. Die wetsontwerp omskryf
deeglik die vereistes waaraan identifikasiemerke moet voldoen.

Die portefeuljekomitee het 'n belangrike versoek gerig dat mense wat nog
nie aansoek gedoen het om die registrasie van 'n merk nie, dit 'n tyd lank
kosteloos moet kan doen. Dit sal die eienaars van byvoorbeeld een bees en
'n paar skape baie help, want ons moet ook hulle vee gemerk kry. Streek- of
landmerke sal diefstal oor grense help bestry, en ons is dankbaar dat daar
voorsiening hiervoor gemaak is.

Die wetstoepassing word tans met 'n sagte hand gehanteer. Dit is nodig om
almal se samewerking te kry om die wetsontwerp geïmplementeer te kry.
Diefstalle sal ook aan bande gelê word indien almal in die toekoms saamwerk
en die voorskrifte uitvoer. Hierdie wetsontwerp maak ook voorsiening dat
telersgenootskappe met nuwe vorms van identifikasie na vore kan kom terwyl
die kleurmerkmetode van krag bly. Die Nuwe NP steun hierdie wetsontwerp.
[Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A S VAN DER MERWE: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and members of this
House, this Act, Act 87 of 1962, is being changed timeously. This Bill
aims, for example, to put in place a farmer-friendly act. It aims to deal
with practical problems of the previous Act. I get the impression that the
drafters of this Bill went to a lot of trouble to take all aspects
thoroughly into account, and we have a lot of appreciation for that.

Bill 49 of 2001 has a few important components, but the Minister and
previous speakers have dealt with this thoroughly. I would, however, like
to highlight the following: It aims to help discourage theft. For a
livestock farmer theft is a big problem. Thieves do not steal branded
livestock easily.

It is, however, a pity that the stock theft units have been abolished. This
Bill must help to combat stock theft, but then we abolish a specialist unit
such as the stock theft unit. These units were very successful with the
combating of stock theft. Even people who slaughtered animals just for the
pot were kept under control. I know this does not fall directly under the
hon the Minister but we hope that the Minister of Safety and Security hears
this as well.

Stock theft investigations require specialised knowledge. This knowledge
has now been lost with the inclusion of the staff concerned in the total
SAPS. This is a loss for agriculture. With the stock theft units gone, and
the policy of the SAPS to spend money as quickly as possible to get people
who slaughter for the pot convicted, also having disappeared, these people
are virtually free to slaughter animals whenever they wish to.

It is surely not the duty of the farmers to provide hungry people with food
in this way. It is the total responsibility of the state to care for people
who do not have food. We should also take cognisance of the fact that many
potslaughterers slaughter to earn money and not merely because they are
hungry.

This Bill makes it possible to use various methods of identification to
enable one to identify one's animals in a legal way. As more sophisticated
methods become available and affordable the owners of animals can implement
them. The Bill thoroughly defines the requirements with which
identification marks should comply.

The portfolio committee has made a very important request that people who
have not yet applied for the registration of a mark, should be able to do
so free of charge for a certain period. This would, for example, help the
owners of one beast and a few sheep a great deal, because we should also
get their livestock marked. Regional or land marks will help to combat
cross-border theft and we are grateful that provision has been made for
this.

At present the law is being implemented very leniently. It is necessary to
get everyone's co-operation to get this Bill implemented. Thefts will also
be curtailed if everyone co-operates in future and carries out the
prescriptions. This Bill also provides that breeders' associations may now
come forward with new forms of identification while the colour branding
method remains in operation. The New NP supports this Bill. [Time
expired.]]
Mr S ABRAM: Chairperson, at the outset, I wish to congratulate the Director
of Genetic Resources in the Department of Agriculture, Dr Moepudi and the
legal advisers for having prepared a Bill which I called, at the original
information session, a ``very clean Bill''. I may tell the House that this
Bill did not require any amendments because, from the word go, it was
properly drafted.

Yes, we have to agree whole-heartedly that animals, particularly cattle,
occupy a very special place in African society. It is a means of bartering
for food and other commodities. It is a means, as the hon the Minister has
said, of paying for the costs of education, university fees and many other
things. Of course, it is also a means of acquiring a wife. If one does not
have animals, one is not a man, and one cannot afford to keep a wife. One
has to pay lobola.

Ja, en mag ek ook vir my vriende hier sê: 'n Mens kan hulle brandmerk, maar
ongelukkig bestaan die DA-merk nou nie meer nie. Hulle is nou die Dooie
Alliansie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Yes, and may I also say to my friends here: One can brand them, but
unfortunately the DA-brand no longer exists. They are now the Dead
Alliance.]

May I just say that I support this Bill, and may I tell the national
Department of Agriculture that we must be very, very circumspect in
assisting people who will not be able to afford identification marks,
especially those people who live on farms and have very few animals. To go
and register an identification mark and buy all the necessary equipment is
going to be cumbersome. We need to assist such people, but we also need to
see to it that such people make use of the identification marks of the
farmer on whose land they live, so that at least those animals are marked.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairperson, the ACDP supports this important Bill. Anything
we can do to stop stock theft is a good thing, and this Bill will act as a
deterrent in the event of a dispute to prove ownership.

Of course, in the light of the new technology available these methods are
very old-fashioned, and Government should be looking at using more advanced
technology, such as a microchip in the animal's ear. The information
recorded on the microchip, such as age, weight, vaccinations, etc, would be
linked to computers and would improve levels of stock farming. State
veterinarians handle every herd once a year or even twice a year for
vaccinations, and could easily implant the microchip into the animal and
register the fact. According to my information this technology is already
available to every state veterinarian.

Skins are a major export commodity, and major car companies source leather
in South Africa, and branding damages the leather, resulting in less money
for the skins or very light branding. This Bill is an improvement and our
only reservation is that it does not take us into the 21st century. The
ACDP supports this Bill.

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, we view the Animal Identification Bill of
2001 as providing a mechanism that will protect animals by way of
regulation, by ensuring that each and every owner registers the animals
they have. Clause 5(2)(b) of the Bill is not only appropriate, it is also
relevant, because if the animal is registered under its own name it would
become difficult to trace the owner, and as such it would make it difficult
to implement clause 15(1) of the Bill.
It is imperative that owners of animals are educated and have access to
this Bill once it becomes an Act, so as to make it possible for them to
appreciate the implications and obligations of owning an animal.

Clause 7(2)(a) does in a way protect animals from being exchanged as gifts
to other people at the whim of an owner. In some cases, the animal ends up
in the wrong hands. That is where it is important to give more powers to
the registrar to inspect and monitor the welfare of animals in our country.
Those without registration certificates for their animals must be punished.

We must also monitor the implementation of this Bill once it becomes an
Act. [Time expired.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Mr Chairperson, the title ``Animal Identification Bill''
sounds a bit funny to people who have never reared animals such as cattle,
horses and sheep. The purpose of the Bill, however, is to consolidate the
law relating to the identification of animals. In these days of escalating
crime, including stock theft, this Bill is timely.

Clause 1 deals with lists of definitions which make the Bill clearer. For
instance, ``mark'' means to place an identification mark on any animal,
``marking instrument'' means any instrument used or intended to be used for
marking animals. The Animal Identification Bill is farmer-friendly
legislation.

The advantages of identification are that permanent visible marks on
animals act as a deterrent because stock thieves are more inclined to steal
unmarked animals. Marked animals are easy to identify when stolen. The Bill
contributes to more effective policing, which results in an improved
recovery rate of lost and stolen animals.

In the opinion of the PAC, this Bill is farmer-friendly and protects
farmers' interests, especially with regard to stock theft. We support the
Animal Identification Bill.

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I think the Bill on the marking of animals
will be an important Act and will help quite a lot as regards a number of
issues. The question of stock theft has been mentioned, as well as that of
disease control. I think one of the important things is that all animals in
South Africa should be marked, especially those of small farmers with one
or two animals, where stock theft becomes a problem and brings down the
business.

Ek dink dit is belangrik dat daar 'n tyd sal kom waarin elke individu wat
'n dier het vrylik sy merk kan registreer, sodat so 'n dier werklik
opgespoor kan word indien dit sou wegraak. [I think that it is important
that there should come a time when every individual owning an animal, can
freely register his mark, in order for such an animal to be found, should
it get lost.]

I would like to mention a subject which I think is quite important at this
stage. With the high price of animals, especially beef cattle in South
Africa, and the lucrative export market due to the fact that the Zimbabwean
industry has collapsed, there are a lot of animals in Zimbabwe for which
there is no market, and these animals can very easily come over the border
into South Africa. As we know, there is an outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease in Zimbabwe. I would like this marking of animals to be applied
very strictly in those areas, so that we do not have any smuggling of
animals over the border. If we were to have an outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease again it could seriously affect our economy. So, I think it is an
important factor which we have to look at and emphasis should be placed on
that area.

A second thing regarding the marketing of animals is the question of mad
cow disease in the future. The EU has laid down rules for the prevention,
control and eradication of certain transmissable spongiform
encephalopathies, or BSE as it is known. That was done on 2 May 2001.
Countries wishing to be retained on the list of Third World countries
approved for the export of beef to the EEC should submit an application to
determine their BSE-free status. Should South Africa not be categorised in
category 2 or 3 by 2 January 2002, a number of further measures will be
compulsory. One of them includes a permanent identification enabling bovine
animals intended for export to the EEC to be traced back to the dam and
herd of origin. Although these regulations apply to the EU, some non-EU
members have already included some of these guidelines in current
certification requirements.

As far as I could determine, the Veterinary Services of SA have not yet
applied for categorisation in category 2 or 3 even after various requests
to do so have been made in this regard. This matter is of the utmost
importance since all endeavours by exporters to develop export markets will
be in vain after January 2002 with no red meat exports leaving South
Africa, and a further compulsory marketing of animals to be traced back to
the father and mother of an animal and the farm. So, this is an important
factor. With this legislation we have we could seriously jeopardise our
situation if we do not give attention to these other methods which
correspond to that.

We will support this Bill and hope that it will apply especially on the
borders of our country to keep the smuggled animals out which pose a
serious threat in terms of diseases, especially foot-and-mouth. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, it appears that the theft of livestock has
become a larger problem requiring some form of identification mark for
livestock to enable policing of the crime.

It is agreed that permanent visible marks made on animals to prove
ownership is certainly a means to control this, but how effective will the
system be if thieves get their hands on unmarked livestock prior to their
being marked and in turn mark the animals themselves? It would therefore be
wise to introduce a receipted document when animals are marked, to be kept
by the owner and supplied to authorities. Perhaps some form of registration
would serve the purpose. However, the system of animal markings would
certainly serve to ensure tighter control over the situation, and it is
hoped that though this system will be to the advantage of the agricultural
industry, the markings will be made on these animals in the least painful
manner.

The MF supports the Animal Identification Bill. [Applause.]

Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Madam Speaker, as was stated by the hon the Minister for
Agriculture and Land Affairs, this Bill will replace the Livestock Brands
Act of 1962.

As we have said before, the drafters of this Bill must be congratulated,
including the department, for a piece of user-friendly legislation. The
need for farm animals to be identified has become increasingly important.
Barely 10 years ago, the Pietersburg magisterial district was still the
only area proclaimed for compulsory animal identification, or branding as
it was known. Subsequent to the reincorporation of the former homelands and
the need to contain stock theft, compulsory identification of livestock has
been expanded to the whole of South Africa.

Stock theft is endemic to South Africa, and although statistics indicate
that there has been an alarming increase, it is also safe to assume that
many cases are presently reported and recorded, which had remained
unattended to in the previous dispensation. It is also appreciated that the
relative impact of stock theft on our small, emerging and subsistence
farmers is far greater. If one has 10 animals and two are stolen, the
impact is greater than if one has 1 000 and 20 are stolen. Although 20 is
still a large number.

Despite the present obligatory identification, these very farmers in the
outlying rural areas have, in many cases, not complied. In virtually every
case it is not in defiance of the law, but because of practical problems.
In many instances, this is due to ignorance, but it can also be ascribed to
the expense of the required equipment. In the case of cattle branding the
cost of irons, tongs, oven and immobiliser are in excess of R1 500.
Similarly, a good tattooing tong for sheep and goats will cost
approximately R500. Obviously these costs are prohibitive for many of the
small farmers.

It is therefore welcomed that the hon the Minister has indicated that the
department is willing to assist these farmers during the phasing-in period.
Required assistance should, in the first place, enable farmers to register
a personal identification mark free of charge. The implication of a
personal identification mark is, however, that each farmer will have to
acquire his or her own branding or tattooing letters or hire a professional
marking operator.

The registrar has also indicated that a single identification, viz a three-
letter sequence, can be registered for a specific communal or tribal area,
followed by a numeral digit, to identify individual owners. The wellknown
system of ear notches can also be used in this regard.

The phasing-in of this system into a herd, viz the marking of adult
animals, is probably the most difficult, as special infrastructure, such as
kraals and runs, is required. Once this has been completed, the progeny are
usually marked at the weaning stage, while any acquired animals have to be
marked within 14 days. In such instances, of course, the necessary
documentation has to be kept.

The advent of the new South Africa and the strengthening of ties within
Southern Africa has also resulted in increasing cross-border activity,
which includes the movements of animals. As has been pointed out, the fact
that this legislation has been put on the table, in conjunction with the
SADC countries, is welcomed.

The legislation also provides for sophisticated methods of identification,
such as the implantation of microchips, etc. This is to be welcomed in view
of the fact that this allows for a multiplicity of information to be
scanned onto and off such a chip.

Although this Bill may be seen as being in the exclusive interest of the
producer, it goes much further. Ideally, the consumer should be able to
trace his or her roast leg of lamb, T-bone steak or braai chop back to the
producer. In future, producer identification marks will probably be
encapsulated in the bar codes of the meat one buys, which ensures
traceability.

It should be noted that the definition of an animal in clause 1 is given as
any animal declared by the Minister. Concern was expressed in the committee
that the Minister could declare certain human beings as animals. In the
present political climate, it would, however, not be surprising if certain
political party leaders were to welcome such a step in order to keep their
flock together. [Interjections.]

The Bill is undoubtedly in the interests of the livestock industry. It is
in the interests of the farming community as a whole, it provides for the
necessary sophistication to be in the interests of the consumer, and it
will ease the task of those police deployed in both our stock theft units
and elsewhere. The ANC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, hon members
will be assured that I do not have the power to actually declare human
beings animals, other than those I am responsible for. So, with regard to
some hopes that my comrade, the hon Schoeman, might have, I am sorry to
say, I am not going to be able to deliver on the promise.

I must, however, say to some of the hon members who have raised some of the
issues of concern, particularly the hon Dudley on the use of technology in
order to advance in this century, that the Bill does accommodate this.
Obviously the framework created by the Bill allows for the level at which
people are, and also for the level at which people might be, relevant to
the resources that they have had.

So this does not mean that people cannot use microchips or any other form
of identification. That is why we have actually changed the name of the
legislation to the Animal Identification Bill instead of the Livestock
Brands Act as it was known before.  I would also like to say to the hon
Abram that I concur with him about the need for support to resource-poor
farmers. This is a matter that the committee may have to look at: how, with
the current resources that we have as a department, we can actually assist
those poor communities who may not have resources to perform this important
task.

I also want to assure the hon Van Niekerk that the matter of legislation,
which will be promulgated in this House, with regard to identification, as
I said earlier, is a matter that was also discussed with our SADC partners.
A number of SADC countries have already passed this Bill. We have been a
bit behind, if I may say so.

However, the challenge for all of us is the enforcement that has to go on
in terms of ensuring that we indeed deal with matters of stock theft and
cattle rustling. I would also like to say that other hon members, rightly
so, raised the issue of the responsibility of our citizens in that they
themselves must be serious in ensuring that we co-operate with the Police
Service and any others to ensure that we protect this industry, not only
for ourselves, but for our country's income as well as that of our great-
grandchildren.

I hope, as I said earlier, that the farming community and all of us will be
happy with the products of this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

  IMPORTANCE OF SUCCESSFUL LAND REFORM PROGRAMME, AS WELL AS LAND INVASIONS
                        AND UPHOLDING OF RULE OF LAW

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, hon members,
to understand the huge task that the Government is confronted with, one has
to put land reform in its historical and political context.

Land reform in South Africa arises from the scale and scope of the land
dispossession of African people that took place since 1652. The
dispossession was aimed at control and domination over the black majority
of this country by the white minority. By the end of the nineteenth
century, millions of African people had been displaced from their ancestral
land to small and poorer patches of land, resulting in overcrowding and
environmental degradation. These areas were later known as native reserves,
and served as a pool of cheap migrant labour for white-owned farms and
mining companies.

During the first three decades of the twentieth century, there were
struggles within the white ruling class over the precise nature of the
uniform native policy that they all agreed was necessary. The difference
arose from the inheritance of the different systems of African
administration in the four provinces, and the contradictory views of white
farmers and mining companies on the principles of African reserves. White
farmers did not support the idea and white mineworkers did not share the
interests of their bosses on the mines and in the factories.

When the National Party government came into power in 1948, it started to
review the native policy. The ultimate result was the introduction of the
separate development policy. Blacks were divided along ethnic lines and
grouped together accordingly, to form what was called separate self-
governing bantu national units. This policy entrenched systems of
traditional leadership, some of which had a very good basis before.
However, it was prostituted by ensuring that certain elements were
incorporated in that administration system which was not compatible with
what those people were used to.

It must be indicated that the implementation of the separate development
policy resulted in the second spate of mass forced removals, which took
place from the 1960s through the 1970s. Africans in black spots, the areas
where Africans had acquired freehold title to their land outside the
Bantustans, were forcibly removed to the Bantustans as a matter of urgent
government priority. About 3,5 million were people were removed from either
urban or rural land.

It is necessary that all of us understand this history, so that as we
debate the land question in South Africa and land reform in general we
understand where we come from, the history and the challenge of where we
were, and what we have sought to do in trying to reverse that legacy.
Therefore, it is prudent for all of us to remind ourselves of that painful
history in order that we may confront it correctly, in a manner that seeks
to take us forward as a nation.

Notwithstanding these challenges, I may say, since 1994 this Parliament and
Government decided to put in place a constitutional and legal framework for
the implementation of land reform, in a manner that is transparent and
accords the public as well as us as public representatives the opportunity
to determine the pace and the scope around which we want land reform to be
undertaken.

All South Africans, I dare say, through the Constitution and the White
Paper on Land Policy, reached consensus that to effect land reform
Government had to implement a programme on land restitution which was about
social redress, land redistribution and land tenure reform. The objectives,
if I can remember, and I am sure members will all recall this, were aimed
at bringing about national reconciliation, because on the one hand we
underscored the property rights of those who had them, but at the same time
land reform was to allocate new rights to those who had never had the right
to property before. It was therefore a means of balancing to ensure that
all of us as South Africans can share the benefits of this national
heritage.

One of the objectives of land reform was to ensure that we deal with the
social and economic development of our country by ensuring that we provide
land for settlement and agricultural purposes. I must say that, from the
beginning, the intention of South Africa's land reform was to deal, on the
one hand, with issues of agricultural needs, and, on the other, with the
issue of settlement.
There were three programmes that we ourselves set as this Parliament and
Government. One was the restitution programme which had to deal
symbolically with issues of social justice. There were 67 314 claims that
were lodged at the end of the cut-off date. Members will all agree with me
that even although the process might have been slow, and there were many
legal processes in between, we have, however, in these seven years, managed
to move somewhat in the positive direction.

Today we have settled about 16 000 claims out of the claims that were
lodged. Others may say that it is too slow. Yes, that may be justifiable,
because the expectation of our people is that this legacy should be
resolved as soon as possible. But the reality dictates that we balance the
pace at which we move with the quality of what we do.

Other critics have been asking: How can the Government boast of having
resolved 16 000 claims when a number of those claims are actually financial
compensation? Yes, that may be true, but I think we must also realise that,
as this Parliament, we created a choice in terms of compensation. We said:
land restoration, alternative land or financial compensation. Sometimes it
is not good to use political expediency when we try to appeal to our
constituencies. We need to state what we have agreed upon in this House.

Concerning land redistribution, we must say that we have moved, again,
towards a positive direction. On the one hand, this was to deal with issues
of landlessness both for settlement and agricultural development. On the
other hand, it was about dealing with the acquisition of land by people who
needed it, again, for settlement and economic use.

We must say that the quality-of-life survey that was done in 1999 by an
independent agency, which monitored the effects of the programme, concluded
in its report for the year 2000 that both the performance and the impact of
the programme had improved since the previous survey in 1998.

According to a recent survey, conducted in August 2001, approximately 87
000 households have benefited from the redistribution programme since 1994,
through accessing land for both settlement and production. We must also say
that regarding land reform, particularly land redistribution, we have
acknowledged in this House that in the first five years we had to deal with
quantity and numbers, and sometimes very little with regard to quality. We
corrected that, because to us, it is not just about the allocation of land,
but about how that land can be utilised to be useful.

As I have said earlier on, the third programme was about the land tenure
system - tenure for farmworkers and labour tenants. We introduced
legislation here and a programme to ensure that we target those who are
vulnerable in our communities. I must say that, in our view, we have moved
towards a positive direction. But, tenure reform is not only about
accessing land for labour tenants and farmworkers; it is also about
granting farm rights to those who were staying in urban areas through the
99-year leasehold.

I will leave this subject for my colleague, the Minister of Housing, who
will participate in this debate, because the view of Government is that
land reform is not just a Land Affairs matter, but an integral programme of
Government which has many facets.

I must say that the challenge that we still face is: How do we deal with
tenure reform for rural communities? How do we ensure that the land
administration system is also effective for development and economic use?
To that effect, we have decided to convene a national land conference which
will take place from 27 to 30 November. The purpose of that conference will
be to allow an opportunity for various political parties and other
stakeholders who will be affected to voice their opinions, so that all of
us can reach a system where we can say that this is the legal framework
around which we can build a better land registration system, also for rural
South Africa.

There have been challenges. Some of the challenges that were acknowledged
have been as a result of the lack of human capacity within the department.
Having said that, one must also acknowledge that in the process some of us
have never thought of land reform as a problem which concerns all South
Africans. It has been treated as a black or native problem. We therefore
did very little to interact with our constituencies to explain the
processes. And I must say, perhaps the Zimbabwe question made all of us as
South Africans realise that this is a problem which concerns all of us, not
just a particular sector of our society.

To that extent, we saw a number of points of interest from other
stakeholders who have started to find a way regarding what they could do.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon Minister, your time has expired.

The MINISTER: Thank you, Madam Speaker. [Interjections.] Well, my colleague
the Minister of Housing will deal with some of the matters that will arise.
Perhaps if I could have one minute, Madam Speaker ...

The SPEAKER: Hon Minister, your time has expired. [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Mevrou die Speaker, ek is eintlik jammer die agb Minister
vir Landbou en Grondsake het nie nog 'n minuut tyd gehad nie, want ek het
'n idee sy het die beste gebêre vir laaste. Ons hoop sy kry die geleentheid
om dit vir ons te sê.

Dit is vir my 'n voorreg om hierdie belangrike onderwerp namens die Nuwe NP
en ons leier, mnr Marthinus van Schalkwyk, wat een van die lede was wat die
debat aangevra het, in te lui.
AGB LEDE: Waar ís hy?

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Hy is besig met konstruktiewe dinge, nie met destruktiewe
goed nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] As gevolg van die herskedulering daarvan en
ander verpligtings kon hy nie self hieraan deelneem nie.

Die Afrikaner het 'n passie om grond te besit, al is dit nie 'n plaas nie,
maar net 'n klein stukkie grond. Dit gaan nie net oor die nutswaarde van
grond, of die mark- of produksiewaarde daarvan nie. Dit gaan oor die
verhewe verantwoordelikheid wat eie is aan vrypag; die reg om kaart en
transport van 'n stukkie grond te besit.

Miljoene ander Afrikane hunker met dieselfde hartstog daarna om grond te
besit. Die Afrikaner verstaan hierdie grondhonger, en ook die woede wat
moontlik ervaar is in gevalle waar grondonteiening en die gedwonge
verskuiwing van mense in die loop van die geskiedenis van Suid-Afrika
plaasgevind het. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Speaker, I am actually sorry that the hon the
Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs did not have another minute,
because I suspect that she kept the best for last. We hope she gets the
opportunity to tell us later.

It is my privilege to introduce this important subject on behalf of the New
NP and our leader, Mr Marthinus Schalkwyk, who was one of the members who
requested this debate.

HON MEMBERS: Where is he?

Dr W A ODENDAAL: He is engaged in constructive affairs, not destructive
ones. [Interjections.] Owing to the rescheduling of this debate and other
commitments he could not participate in this debate.

The Afrikaner has a passion to own land, even if it is not a farm, but
simply a small piece of land. It is not only about the usefulness of the
land, or its market or production value. It is about the lofty
responsibility which is inherent in owing property; the right to own the
title deed to a piece of land.

Millions of other Africans also desire passionately to own land. The
Afrikaner understands this hunger for land, as well as the anger which was
possibly experienced in cases where land dispossession and the forced
removal of people occurred in the course of the history of South Africa.]

Many South Africans have suffered from land dispossession, denial of
adequate access to land, inappropriate types of title to such land and
restrictions to the use thereof. This unacceptable situation can still be
rectified through an aggressive land reform programme, including the
restitution, redistribution and tenure reform of land, as the hon Minister
has mentioned. The New NP therefore supports the land reform programme
embarked upon by Government. It should, however, be stepped up, and we will
suggest ways and means to achieve this.

The biggest single mistake any government can make is to try and dump
hundreds or thousands of unemployed people on agricultural land as
peasants, small-scale farmers or farm labourers. Agriculture may never be
deemed the creator of large numbers of job opportunities. Other sectors of
the economy, especially the secondary and tertiary sectors, will have to
provide for economic growth and job creation to fight poverty.

We therefore commend the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs on her
stance aggressively to promote the settlement of commercial black farmers
on available agricultural land, rather than creating pockets of poverty by
settling too many people on too small pieces of land all over the country.
Unfortunately, this is what happened under the regime of her predecessor,
who would not listen to reason.

The subdivision of agricultural land on a large scale in order to put large
numbers of people back on the land will, without a doubt, lead to lower
productivity, less profitability, more poverty and, within a short period
of time, the growing inability of the farming sector to feed and clothe the
people of South Africa and, as is expected to happen next year, its
neighbouring countries.

However, as an urgent matter, to promote a market-driven economy in South
Africa and address the plight of the poor, all South Africans should be
enabled to acquire property, including land, with secure title and the
right to hold, use, sell, let and mortgage such property.

Private property ownership lies at the heart of a successful economic
system, and all the people should have access to it. A poor man must be
given the chance to own a piece of land, even a stand in a township, which
he can later sell at a profit and on which he does not even have to pay
capital gains tax. By so doing, one would have created an instant
entrepreneur in a free-market environment who would have acquired the taste
to excel, learnt to believe in the economic system, become willing to
compete and be raring to care for his family with dignity.

It is of paramount importance that we should all understand that
agricultural land is a very scarce commodity. It is, therefore, necessary
that every possible piece of available land that is owned by the state
should be targeted immediately, in the short term, and be utilised for the
establishment of economically viable farming units for black commercial
farmers. Every piece of land becoming available via the Land Bank in cases,
for instance, where white farmers go insolvent or for whatever other
reason, should be earmarked for the settlement of black commercial farmers.

The need for security of tenure is probably the most important facet of
land ownership that needs to be addressed. Zimbabwe has proved this by
setting a very bad example. Owning a farm where people are allowed to
invade one's land, without the owner being protected by the state, results
in such land becoming worthless. The entrepreneur loses faith and all end
up in a devastated economy, which in turn reflects worst on the poor and
the vulnerable.

We therefore praise the Government's stance during the recent invasion of
land near Bredell. South Africa was immediately awarded with investors from
within South Africa and abroad showing more confidence in the South African
economy.

Secure land property rights should be underpinned by the constitutional
principle that land should only change hands according to the principle of
a willing buyer and a willing seller. Anybody understands that more land
will always be needed for strategic regions. The expropriation of such land
should always take place according to the same principle.

There is a very important difference between landownership rights and land
use rights. Black farmers on tribal land often experience insecure land
rights. Those are land use rights. They do not own the land they farm
because it is state-owned and they are dependent on decisions by tribal
authorities for security of land use rights.

These areas, which constitute about 20% of all available agricultural land
in South Africa, occur mostly in the eastern parts of South Africa. They
mostly fall within high rainfall and potentially high agricultural
production areas. With the close co-operation of the responsible tribal
authorities, a system of more secure land use rights, for instance long-
term lease rights, and better scientific agricultural production programmes
could be put in place, and that would at least double or triple the income
from agriculture in these areas.

With the aid of the necessary extension programmes, these goals can be
achieved. The process of enabling meaningful numbers of black commercial
farmers to settle as commercial farmers should be fast-tracked and the
necessary financial support schemes to buy land and finance production
inputs be put in place. Existing commercial farmers should have an earnest
look into models of co-ownership for their farm labourers in the common
agricultural business which they run together.

Supportive extension programmes, painstakingly executed to introduce
emerging farmers of all races to the most recent scientific knowledge in
the fields of technology and financial management, are of paramount
importance for the successful settlement of any beginner farmer.

As die skewe rasseverdeling van die kommersiële boere nie oor die
korttermyn betekenisvol reggestel kan word nie, sal niemand in Suid-Afrika
rustig slaap nie. Wie ook al die grondhonger onder veral swart Suid-
Afrikaners onderskat, speel met vuur. Ons vra die samewerking van elke
regdenkende mens om grondhervorming in Suid-Afrika te laat slaag. Die breë
boeregemeenskap en die SA Landbou-unie is begerig om alle moontlike hulp te
verleen om 'n katastrofe te voorkom. Die Nuwe NP is gereed en gewillig om
in belang van Suid-Afrika 'n konstruktiewe bydrae te lewer om
grondhervorming te laat slaag. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[If the skewed racial distribution of the commercial farmers is not
significantly rectified in the short term, no one will sleep peacefully in
South Africa. Whoever underestimates the hunger for land, especially among
black South Africans, is playing with fire. We ask for the co-operation of
every right-minded person to allow land reform to succeed in South Africa.
The farming community in general and the South African Agricultural Union
are eager to lend all possible assistance in order to prevent a
catastrophe. The New NP is ready and willing, in the interests of South
Africa, to make a constructive contribution so that land reform succeeds.
[Applause.]]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Madam Speaker, perhaps it is due to time constraints that
we have such a long-winded heading as the subject for debate, namely ``The
importance of a successful land reform programme; land invasions and the
responsibility of parties represented in Parliament to uphold the rule of
law’’.

Perhaps, also, I should use some buzzwords to explain this a little, namely
this is the land reform programme, those are failures and successes, land
invasions, the negative impact on the economy and the sociopolitical order,
parliamentary parties and the obligation of upholding the rule of law, and
a proposed way forward.

Under land reform I wish to state that it is no longer an academic exercise
whether or not the land reform programme needs to be in place. For us it is
a constitutional imperative to recognise and support the land reform
programme that is already in place. Without ignoring the pros and cons of
this land reform programme, we should guard against projecting to the
public this programme as a sectarian or party-political programme, or using
it as a tool to pull out at election time in order to garner votes here and
there.

The land issue is serious business, emotive, and, without exaggerating the
issue, a matter of life and death. The seriousness of this topic calls for
a high degree of responsible involvement by all and sundry.

Much has already been said and churned out about land reform in this
country, and the Minister has just given us the background. We need only
remind ourselves that the programme has three cardinal component parts, and
I do not know why the Minister used the past tense. These parts are
redistribution, restitution and land tenure reform with special reference
to ESTA - the Extension of Security of Tenure Act, and that is not my wife.
[Laughter.]

The problems or weaknesses bedevilling the programme can be listed, amongst
other problems, as follows: slow delivery in respect of and meeting the
concomitant demands of land delivery budgetary constraints: inadequate
budgets and the contradictory lack of capacity to expend allocations; the
difficulties relating to the concept of willing buyer or willing seller,
juxtaposed with property rights; and the inadequate participation of
stakeholders and interested parties across the spectrum. These are but a
few of the hurdles facing us in the implementation of our land reform
programme.

We, however, recognise the efforts that have been made since the review
policy, but wish to state that whilst some progress has been made, more
still has to be made.
The Government must not shy away from listening to criticism and accepting
valuable suggestions from whatever quarter, as long as these inputs are
constructive and within the constraints of the Constitution and the laws of
our country.

What needs to be done? We need to continue refining and fine-tuning the
process in order to speed it up, without jeopardising equity and fairness
to all stakeholders. We need to ensure that the process is conducted to
enhance the intentions of the Constitution, namely redressing past
injustices and reinforcing the reconciliation of a previously fragmented
society. We also need to bolster the so-called integrated development
programme approach, and we need to take serious cognisance of improving and
stabilising freehold-title landownership and tenure of previously
disadvantaged communities.

We should search for innovative models of harmonising the forms of
landownership, that is, communal landownership and private freehold-title
landownership. We also need to encourage, with incentives, more young
people to choose agricultural and veterinary sciences as careers.

What about land invasions? Land invasions cannot and should not be condoned
or encouraged, especially for political expediency. Our neighbour Zimbabwe
is on that suicidal road. If this is not so, why do Zimbabwean citizens
risk life and limb to migrate to South African farms? [Interjections.]

The Government should not brook any political mavericks who encourage and
manipulate land invasions with spurious statements. [Interjections.] Whilst
recognising that homelessness, like poverty, is linked to landlessness, the
Government has to look at squatter camps as a form of land invasion, if
such camps are not regulated and controlled according to proper land and
housing development norms.

The Government needs a strong will to deal with this sore point. The ANC,
more than admonishing others such as the PAC and some NGOs, needs to admit
its share of the blame in land occupations, culminating in a myriad of
squatter camps that continue to subject the majority of our citizens to
abject poverty and health hazards, including crime.

Last but not least, it is the responsibility of all parties represented in
Parliament to respect the Constitution regarding national programmes such
as the land reform programme, and not to indulge in actions that violate
the imperatives of this very Constitution. Issues must be debated in
appropriate structures and through acceptable and responsible processes.

The Constitution can be lawfully and responsibly amended in a democracy, if
needs be. Reckless rebel-rousing tactics that undermine the sociopolitical
climate and economic stability should not be entertained. However, it is
also the Government's responsibility to take note of suggestions from a
variety of groups such as political parties, NGOs and so on. It is in the
interest of all South Africans that this programme be speeded up and made
successful to meet the expectations of the citizens of this country.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! The hon Mr Komphela will be delivering his maiden
speech. [Applause.]

Mr B M KOMPHELA: Madam Speaker, hon members and comrades, land ownership in
South Africa has, for a long time, been a source of conflict and continues
to be a central problem in the socioeconomic and political arena in this
country. Our history of quest, dispossession, forced removals and racially
skewed distribution of land has been a problem in this country. Up until
today it is still a problem.

An important clause was provided for in the Constitution to ensure that the
consequences of this legacy are redressed and the question of land is dealt
with peacefully, in an orderly manner. This clause was introduced by the
Government led by the ANC. A national land reform programme is a centre
that is supposed to drive all our efforts and there should be clearly
designed programmes that people and political should follow. These are very
important. This process should also not antagonise anyone, and should be
implemented peacefully.

The ANC-led Government has accelerated the implementation of three key
elements of the land reform programme as adopted in this House. The hon the
Minister has spoken about land distribution. But I think I have to make an
attempt to show the key importance of land redistribution. This programme
has attempted to provide for the marginalised people of this country,
especially Africans. A large percentage of the population of this country,
about 80%, do not own land yet. Twenty per cent of the people of this
country own 80% of the land. This problem needs to be addressed. The
Minister and the ANC have made suggestions on how this problem can be
addressed.

The strategic objective of land distribution for agricultural programmes is
also one of the important key elements in this picture. I will cite one or
two very important facts contributing to the redistribution of that 30% of
the country's agricultural land. The redistribution is to be done over the
next 15 years and will help with the eradication of poverty. It will
improve the nutrition of the rural poor and increase the income of people
who want to farm on a smaller or a larger scale.

These opportunities should also be extended to women, because they are the
people who suffer most when there is no food at home. They are also experts
at tilling the land.

I will not speak much about land restitution. I want to sketch to the House
what happened when the Minister visited the town of Kroonstad in the Free
State, where I come from. The people of Marabastad cried tears of joy. They
suffered for many years. The previous government destroyed them by
repossessing all their land and thus stripped them of their dignity. The
fathers sat there and cried. They said: ``At long last we can come back to
the land of our forefathers.'' For a long time misery and pain were
instilled in these people. [Applause.]

Recently the invasion of land was propagated to us in the ANC. We view that
as the actions of reactionary forces that want to derail our process. Our
people are under much tension, but understand that land redistribution is a
slow process. But they remain prisoners of hope. Those who own the land
must realise that the time has come to give the land back to those it was
taken from a long time ago. This should not be done by forced removal or by
grabbing the land.

Such actions have consequences. We should negotiate, follow certain
guidelines and the rule of law. We in the ANC, and nobody else, urged our
people to exercise maximum patience and not to grab land. They understand
that although the process is very slow, they will achieve their dream.

Vandag wil ek soos 'n Vrystater praat. My pa het 40 jaar lank op 'n plaas
by Kroonstad gebly en gewerk. Die dag toe die eienaar van die plaas weggaan
Nederland toe het my pa op die plaas gebly. Dit is nou al agt jaar.

My pa het geen akademiese kwalifikasies gehad nie, maar my pa het bo alles
``experience'' gehad. Hy was baie bekwaam en het geweet wanneer die mielies
geplant moet word, wanneer die koring geplant moet word, wanneer die
bulletjies gesny moet word. Al daardie goed het my pa sonder enige mens se
hulp en sonder enige skoolopleiding gedoen. Wat is die probleme wat keer
dat ons ons mense die geleenthede gee om die grond self te bewerk, om kos
vir die kinders en die mense te gee? [Applous.]

Dit is nogal 'n probleem. Mense soos Dries Botha en mnr Van der Merwe weet
presies. Terwyl hulle in die Parlement is, sal die plaaswerkers die skape
dip, en alles doen wat gedoen moet word. Wat is die probleme? Hoekom kan
ons mense nie 'n kans kry om boere te wees op plase in die Vrystaat nie wat
so 'n groot en goeie plek is? Dit is nou tyd vir daardie kans. Ons moet nou
saamwerk en vir die mense sê dit is tyd om swart boere in dié land te maak
sodat ons vir die mense kan kos gee. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Today I want to speak as a Free Stater. My father lived and worked on a
farm at Kroonstad for 40 years. When the owner of the farm moved to the
Netherlands, my father remained on the farm. That was eight years ago.

My father had no academic qualifications, but, above all, he had
experience. He was very competent and knew when the maize had to be
planted, when the wheat had to be planted, when the bullocks had to be
castrated.  My father did all those things without anyone's help and
without any formal education. What is preventing us from giving our people
the opportunity to cultivate the land themselves, to provide food for the
children and the people? [Applause.]

It is quite a problem. People like Dries Botha and Mr Van der Merwe know
exactly what I mean. While they are in Parliament, the farm workers will
dip the sheep and do everything that has to be done. What is the problem?
Why can our people not get the opportunity to be farmers on farms in the
Free State, which is such a large and beautiful place? The time has come
for us to give them that opportunity. We must now work together and tell
the people the time has come for us to make black farmers in this country
so that we can provide our people with food. [Applause.]]

INkosi M W HLENGWA: Somlomo namalungu ahloniphekile, nanxa kudabukisa
ukuthi sekuphele iminyaka eyisikhombisa udaba lomhlaba lungakalungiswa,
kuyathokozisa ukuzwa ukuthi kukhona amaphuzu umuntu angahambisana nawo
kulawo abekwe umhlonishwa uNgqongqoshe wezoLimo nemiHlaba.

Uma ngibuka ngapha elungwini elihloniphekile le-New NP, ngizwa ngingezwa
nje kahle uma kulula kuyena lapho ekhuluma ngendaba ka-willing buyer no-
willing seller ngoba ngesikhathi okhokho bakhe befika lapha imali abathenga
ngayo umhlaba kwaba yizinhlamvu zesibhamu, kodwa namhlanje kukhulunywa
indaba ka-willing buyer nowilling seller. Angazi ukuthi okhokho bangathini
uma bezwa lolu limi.

Angiqale ngokuzwakalisa ukuthi angihambisani nalabo abathi kukhona
ingqinamba ngendaba yokubuyela komhlaba kubaniniwo. Uma kungenzeka ukuthi
kubukeke sengathi lesi simo sikhona, kungabe senziwa yilabo abafisa
sibukeke sikhona sibe singekho, ngoba phela izwe laseNingizimu Afrika
alikaze lingabi nabo abanini balo bempela, kuphela nje okwenzeka ngukuthi
lake laphathwa ngabamhlophe ngendlovuyangena nangemibhobho yezibhamu. Lokho-
ke akukaze kusho ukuthi lalingelabo. Nakhu phela salilwela, salifela,
saliboshelwa ngoba siveza ubufakazi bokuthi izwe liyafelwa. Futhi noma nini
uma into kungeyakhe umuntu akayiyeki ithathwe abanye abafana sengathi wadla
iphaphu elicwiliswe emanzini. [Ubuwelewele.] Kungalesi sizathu-ke ngithi
ayikho ingqinamba odabeni lomhlaba, kepha okukhona ubuxoki bokwehluleka
ukukhuluma amaqiniso enjengoba enjalo.

Okokuqala amakhosi alilwela leli zwe. Okwesibili, kanti ngabe yini eyasusa
umzabalazo uma kungekona ukuthi kwathathwa izwe elaliphethwe ngamakhosi
lithathwa ngabamhlophe. Kukhona izimpi ezaziwayo lapho kwakubhekene khona
amabutho ezizwe zomdabu nabamhlophe kubangwa umhlaba wezizwe ezahlukene
zamakhosi. Namhlanje ngubani ongathi umhlaba awaziwa ukuthi owezizwe
ezahlukene ezaficwa abelungu eNingizimu Afrika?

Isizwe esimhlophe sokuqala esaphatha iNingizimu Afrika kwaba ngamaNgisi
aseNgilandi ngaphansi kombuso kaJoji. Emuva kwalokho ngo-1948 kwathatha
amaBhunu. Kuze kube namhlanje izwe laseNgilandi liphethwe ngobukhosi
bakhona futhi bulinomhlaba wabo.

Lo mkhandlu uke walalela indlovukazi yamaNgisi ikhuluma lapha endlini,
futhi ingakhohliwe ukuthi umbuso wamaNgisi wake waphatha lapha eNingizimu
Afrika emuva kokwephuca amakhosi amandla nomhlaba. Okwamangalisa ngukuthi
indlovukazi ayizange ikhunjuzwe ukubonana namakhosi, ngoba yazi kahle
ukuthi leli zwe linobukhosi bezizwe ezahlukahlukene ezinomhlaba wazo.

Kungayihlazo uma kungakhona isiphukuphukwana nje somuntu esingazenza
sengathi asazi ukuthi isizwe samaMpondo sinezwe nobukhosi baso nokuthi
isizwe samaXhosa sinezwe nobukhosi baso. Kukhona isizwe samaZulu sinezwe
nobukhosi baso, kukhona isizwe sabeSuthu - ngingazibala ngithini!
NamaNdebele akhona njengesizwe, anobukhosi bawo.

Ubugovu bamaNgisi bazama ngawo wonke amandla ukudunga le mibuso. Emuva
kokuvota uma sikhuluma ngokuvuselela isakhiwo sobu-Afrika kanti sikhuluma
ngani, uma sizokwehluleka ukulungisa okwakuhlasela ngenhloso yokubhidliza
lokhu okwenziwa yizizwe ezimhlophe. Uma lo mKhandlu uzokwehluleka
ukuvuselela izimiso zendabuko, kusho ukuthi wemukela ukuba yindlalifa
yalabo abacekela phansi loko ebesingazizwa ngako singama-Afrika empela,
hhayi amakhukhunathi noma amazemtiti wona ansundu ngaphandle kuphela
ngaphakathi angabelungu abamhlophe kunabamhlophe. [Ubuwelewele.]
(Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Inkosi M W HLENGWA: Madam Speaker and hon members, although it is said
that the land issue has not been resolved even after seven years, it is
pleasing that there are facts mentioned by the Minister for Agriculture and
Land Affairs that one can sympathise with.

When I look at the hon member of the New NP, I do not understand why it is
so easy for him to talk about willing buyer and willing seller, because
when his ancestors arrived here, the money that they used to buy land were
bullets, but today they talk about willing buyer and willing seller. I do
not know what our ancestors would say if they could hear this language.

I must first mention that I do not agree with those who say there is a land
redistribution problem. If such a situation exists, those who want us to
believe that there is a problem, while we do not have such a problem have
created it. South Africa has never been without its real owners. What
happened was that it was once ruled by whites by means of guns and force.
But that does not mean that it was theirs. That is why we fought for it, we
died for it and were even arrested for it, because we were giving evidence
that land is worth dying for. At any time in life one does not allow other
people to freely take what belongs to one as if one is a coward.
[Interjections.] That is why I say there is no problem with land
redistribution, what we have is a situation where people are failing to
speak the truth as it is.

Firstly, amakhosi fought for this land. Secondly, what initiated the
struggle if it was not the desire to reclaim the land of amakhosi from
whites? There are well-known wars where African warriors fought whites
because of the land that belonged to amakhosi of different nations. Who can
now say he does not know that land belongs to different nations that were
in South Africa before the whites came?

The first white nation to rule South Africa was the British from England,
under the leadership of King George. In 1948 the Boers took over South
Africa. Even today England is still ruled by a queen and the people of
England have their own land.

This Parliament once heard the Queen of England talking in this House. She
still remembers that South Africa was once governed by England after they
had taken the land from the indigenous amakhosi. What was surprising was
that the Queen of England was not reminded to visit amakhosi, since she
knows very well that this country consists of many different kingdoms that
have their own land.

It would be an insult if a foolish person came along and pretended he did
not know that the Mpondo people have their own kingdom and king. And that
the Xhosa nation has its own kingdom. There is a Zulu nation, and it has
its own land and kingdom. There is also a Sotho nation, the list is
endless! Even the Ndebele have a nation and their own kingdom.

The greed of the whites caused them to try by all means to destroy these
kingdoms. After elections, when we talk about rebuilding Africa, what else
do we talk about if we fail to correct those destructive things used by
whites. If this House fails to rebuild traditional structures, it means it
accepts that they are the heirs of those who destroyed the things which
would have made us real Africans, not coconuts or exempted people who have
dark skin while inside they are even whiter than the white people.]
[Interjections.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: It has been ruled here
recently that racist terms such as ``coconuts'', ``abamhlophe ngaphandle''
[white on the inside] or whatever, are not acceptable in this august
building, Parliament. [Interjections.] The hon speaker is using those terms
again.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, could you please repeat what you said?

INkosi M W HLENGWA: Ngiyathokoza Somlomo, Ngiyokhuluma ngabo labo, kuphela
nje uma belokhu bekhona kuleli zwe, ngiyokhuluma ngalokho. [Uhleko.] [Thank
you, Madam Speaker. I will talk about these people as long as they shall
exist in this country. I will talk about that. [Laughter.]]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, if you used those terms, you are out of
order. Would you please withdraw them?

INkosi M W HLENGWA: Madam Speaker, that is an allegation. I am not out of
order.
The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, I asked you first to repeat what you said
so we could be clear what the allegation is. If you are not prepared to
repeat it, or indicate what you did say, then you are out of order. So
please, I am allowing you to repeat what you said.

Chief M W HLENGWA: Somlomo, sengizwile. Ngiyayivumela le ndoda ngizobuye
ngikhulume nayo emnyango. [Uhleko.] [Madam Speaker, I understand. I agree
with this man, I will talk to him outside. [Laughter.]]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, I am sorry, but you cannot speak with
people outside. There is a debate going on. [Interjections.] You can speak
outside, but the terms you use in this House ... I will look at Hansard and
you will withdraw the statements if they are out of order. However ...

Mr M W HLENGWA: Useless intimidation!

The SPEAKER: Order! Would you please sit down. However, if you are going to
continue now, would you please not repeat those terms, if you did in fact
use them. So please, will you now proceed.
INkosi M W HLENGWA: Somlomo, ngibona kuyiphutha ukuguqula imigomo yalabo
abasungula amaqembu omzabalazo. Kwakungesiyona inhloso yabo ukuthi
bayolwisana nezakhiwo zabo zomlando nezomdabu, bese bephenduka ophangubude
abagcina ngokuphatha izwe ngalezo zindlela zalabo ababengabacindezeli.

Kufanele ngabe siyakhumbuzeka ukubaluleka kwemvelaphi yethu, nangendlela
esabunjwa ngayo. Uma sihambela amazwe angaphandle, mina njengomZulu
waseNingizimu Afrika ngiye ngithokoze uma ezinye izizwe zibubona ubuZulu
kimi. Lokho kuye kungenze ngikhumbule ukuthi ngingumsebenzi weSilo
sakwaDukuza, iNkosi uShaka uDlungwane lombelebele, iLembe eleqa amanye
amalembe ngokukhalipha. Ngiye ngikhumbule ukuthi leli qhawe labumba, lahola
futhi lahlanganisa isizwe ngeminyaka eyishumi nanye nje kuphela.

Wonke lo msebenzi inkosi yami eyaqinisa umhlaba wonke yawenza ingazange
ikwazi ukufunda nokubhala igama layo. Kunye okwaba khona lapha ezweni.
Kwakuyizwe elikhululekile. Ngiyabuza-ke kulabo abangama-Afrika, mhlawumbe
abangamaZulu, sekusele iminyaka emine vo kuhlangane iminyaka eyishumi nanye
niqalile ukuvota, imfundo yenu isivikele ngani isizwe senu esakhiwa
ngaphandle kokuzuzwa kwemfundo?

AbangamaXhosa ngiyababuza ukuthi imfundo yabo bayisebenzise kanjani
ekuvikeleni isizwe sikaPhalo, noma okukhulu ukugxisha amasiko ezinye izizwe
ezagcina sezizithokozisa ngesifazane sakithi. AmaMpondo aseNingizimu Afrika
akhuluma isiMpondo. Akhuluma isiMpondo nabamhlophe ngelanga lokuqala
bebonana. Namhlanje ezweni esithi likhululekile, elinezilimi eziyishumi
nanye okuthiwa zisemthethweni, isiMpondo sona asikho kulezo zilimi. Kodwa
lezo ezafika nabaninizo zona ziyabalwa, kuthi isiMpondo esingumnsinsi
wokuzimilela sikhishelwe ngaphandle okwenyongo yenyathi.

Kulolu daba esikhuluma ngalo, kubalulekile ukuthi siphawule ngesimo
sokulondolozwa kokusebenza komthetho nanxa sikhuluma ngomhlaba owake
wathathwa kithi ngabantu abangazange bakunake ukulondolozwa komthetho
nelungelo lethu lobuzibulo kuleli zwe.

Ngifisa ukusho ukuthi thina njengama-Afrika asizange sifundiswe ngabelungu
ukulondoloza isiko lokugcinwa komthetho. Imibuso yethu yayivele inemithetho
eyayakhiwe yisizwe ngokuvumelana, igcinwe ngokufaneleyo. Uma kuqalwa
ngokuthi akugcinwe imithetho eyasephuca ilungelo lethu njengezizwe
zaseNingizimu Afrika, kuyothanda ukuthi kungehli kahle.

Omunye umbandela okulindeleke ukuthi siphawule ngawo kulolu daba yilokho
okungumthwalo obhekene namaqembu ezombusazwe amelekile lapha kule Ndlu
yakho ehloniphekile eshaya imithetho. Kubalulekile ukuthi amaqembu abeke
uvo lwawo esigcawini esifanele lapho kukhona khona izizwe lezo ezaphucwa
umhlaba wazo zibe ziholwa ngabaholi bazo ezinhlakeni zobukhosi.

Kungaba yiphutha ukulawula kwamaqembu aze athathe izinqumo engakaze abe
ngabanikazi bomhlaba owahlwithwa ngabamhlophe emibusweni eyayikhona
yendabuko. Indlovukazi yaseNgilandi ingumnini womhlaba wobukhosi. Iqembu
lezombusazwe alikwazi ukuthatha lelo lungelo ebukhosini.

Ngithi angikhumbuze ukuthi kwachitheka igazi phakathi kwethu nalabo
ababezodla izwe lethu. Emuva kwalokho sabheda nathi ngoba sagcina
sesishayana sodwa. Asingaqhubeki-ke manje sizame ukukhuluma indaba yomhlaba
sibe sazi ukuthi wathathwa emakhosini nezizwe zawo. Kufanele leso naleso
sizwe kube yiso esizokhomba indlela efanele ukulandelwa ngomhlaba waso.

Uma singahloniphani, kuyoba kuhle ukuthi zonke lezi zikhali ezasungulwa
yilaba abafika nazo, keziphinde kubo lezo zikhali; ukuze siqoqe kahle
sikhumbuzane ukuthi ubani ungubani, ngoba phela lezi zikhali zidala
izinsizwa neziqhwaga nalapho zingekho khona.

Ngiyaphakamisa ukuthi labo abafanele ukuhlela lezi zingxoxo ezimayelana
nomhlaba wezizwe zamakhosi ukuthi kukhona izifundazwe ezintathu namhlanje
ezingasenabo ubukhosi kepha babukhona. Lobu bukhosi-ke budinga
ukuvuselelwa. Ngikhuluma lapha ngeNyakatho Kapa, iGauteng neNtshonalanga
Kapa.

Kusemqoka ukuthi ama-Afrika kulezi zifundazwe ezintathu nawo azizwe
efudumele ngaphansi komlando nesiko nobukhosi bawo. Abaholi abakhethiwe
abasoze bakhululeka noma behluleke ukusebenza bebodwa, kodwa bayophumelela
uma besebenza phezu kwezinhlaka zobuholi bomdabu zisekelwe ubukhosi.

Azibuyele ekhaya ziyodla khona ukuze kube nokuthula kwempela ezweni
lakithi. Ngiyathokoza! [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Inkosi M W HLENGWA: Madam Speaker, I think it is a mistake to change the
principles of those who initiated political organisation. It was not their
aim to oppose traditional structures and then become people who are
ambitious for power and who end up leading the country by means of the
oppressors.

We should have been reminded of the importance of our background and how we
were established. When we visit other countries, I as a South African Zulu
man become happy if other people recognise Zuluness in me. That makes me
remember that I am the work of the King of Dukuza, His Majesty King Shaka,
Dlungwane of the Mbelebele kraal, the hoe that surpasses other hoes in
sharpness. I then remember that this hero built, led and united a nation
within only 14 years.

All this work to strengthen the world my King did without even being able
to read or write his name. One thing came into existence in the land. It
was a free land. I want to ask those who are Africans, perhaps the Zulu we
have only four years to reach 11 years since we started voting: How did
your education protect your nation?

I am asking the Xhosa people how they had used their education to protect
the nation of Phalo? Or what is important to them, to assimilate the
cultures of other people who ended up enjoying themselves with our women?
The South African Mpondo people speak isiMpondo. They spoke isiMpondo the
moment they spoke to the whites for the first time. Today in a country we
call a free one, and which has 11 official languages, isiMpondo is not one
of them. Those who are not traditional are included, but isiMpondo, which
is traditional, is isolated.

Regarding the issue that we are discussing, it is important to mention the
situation pertaining to the preserving of law when we talk about land that
was taken from us by people who did not care about preserving the law and
our right as pioneers in this country.

I would like to mention that whites have never taught Africans how to
preserve the culture of respecting the law. Our nations had already had
laws that were made in agreement with people and they were obeyed in the
proper manner. If we start by saying we should obey the laws that deprive
us of our right as South African nations that would not be proper.

Another thing that we should talk about in this debate is the challenge
facing political parties who are in this House. It is important that
political parties put their opinions in the right place, where those
nations whose land was taken from them will be present under the leadership
of their leaders in the structures of amakhosi.

It would be a mistake if political parties were to govern, since they had
never been owners of this land that was taken by whites from traditional
kingdoms before. The Queen of England is the owner of the land of the
kingdom. A political party cannot take that right away from the kingdom.

Let me remind you that blood was shed between us and those who were
plundering our land. After that, we went astray because we ended up killing
one another. Let us not continue talking about land because we know that it
was taken from amakhosi and their nations. Each nation must pave the way
that needs to be followed regarding its land.

If we are not respectful, it would be better if all these weapons, invented
by those who arrived with them, are returned to them, because they create
marauders even where they do not exist.

I propose to those who should arrange a discussion regarding the land of
the nations and amakhosi, that there are three provinces today which do not
have their kingdoms although they had them before. These kingdoms need to
be rebuilt. I am talking here about the Western Cape, Gauteng and the
Northern Cape.

It is important that Africans in these provinces feel secure under the
history and culture of their kingdoms. Elected leaders will never be free
nor fail to work on their own, but they will succeed if they work upon the
traditional structures supported by kingship.

Cattle must go back home and graze there so that we will have real peace in
our land. Thank you! [Applause.]]

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon member Komphela
on his maiden speech.

Hy het uit die grond van sy hart gepraat. Mag sy Here dit vir hom moontlik
maak om eendag in Kroonstad sy eie plaas te besit. [He spoke from the
depths of his heart. May his Lord make it possible that he can one day own
his own farm in Kroonstad.]

The debate is intended to highlight the responsibility of parties
represented in the constitutionally created structures of our country to
uphold the rule of law. However, any discourse on such responsibilities
needs to take into account various historical factors which contribute to
certain behavioural patterns.

May I say that the importance of any policy can only become tangible if it
is implemented successfully. It is therefore important that all role-
players, civil society, NGOs and political parties voice their
dissatisfaction and criticism through the relevant structures. That is the
nature of democracy.

When members of parties were elected to represent their constituencies in
Parliament they took an oath to uphold the rule of law. South Africa has a
Constitution which creates a framework for democratic participation. It is
then irresponsible, for example, of a member of Parliament or political
parties to encourage their members to break the law.

In its 1998 White Paper on land policy, the department set the following
objectives: Firstly, to redress apartheid injustices; secondly, to foster
national reconciliation and stability; thirdly, to underpin economic
growth; and fourthly, to improve household welfare, and alleviate poverty.
A holistic approach, therefore, becomes a necessity.

The recent land invasion at Bredell shows almost 10 000 people cramming
into 32 hectares of land. Whilst many of the invaders were South Africans,
many were from SADC countries and even further afield. It follows that many
people from SADC countries are in South Africa seeking to escape poverty,
unemployment, instability and war where they come from.

We need to have empathy for these fellow Africans, and it becomes even more
compelling for us to ensure that the SADC region is stabilised and
developed so that the causes leading to south-bound migration are removed.

To achieve this, we all have an important contribution to make. Within the
borders of our country, we witness a constant mobility of people,
particularly from the rural areas towards metropole in the hope of finding
better opportunities. In many instances these fellow South Africans have
comfortable homes in the rural areas, but are forced by economic
circumstances to make their trek and live in overcrowded and often squalid
informal settlements on the outskirts of our cities.

It is guesstimated that at least 2,8 million homes are needed to satisfy
the current housing need, which no government has the capacity to provide.
The challenge before us is to play a major role in promoting, firstly, the
development of the SADC region. The success thereof will stabilise SADC
generally and South Africa in particular, and boost the African
Renaissance. Merely criticising failures in the region is not the answer,
and we should desist from doing so.
It quite clear that in order to stem the tide of mobility towards the
cities from our rural areas, a massive campaign to develop identified nodal
points in the rural areas is necessary. And let us admit, progress has been
reasonably slow. An integrated, all-encompassing plan into which all role-
players can buy is necessary to achieve this objective.

Whilst Government can create the climate and conditions to make this
happen, it cannot absolutely deliver the desired results. In order achieve
this, all sectors of society need to be brought on board. The housing
backlog must be addressed by completing what housing departments are doing.
People, and particularly South Africans, take pride in what they own.

Land Affairs should consider laying out surveyed sites in planned living
areas and make these available to the homeless. Naturally, services can
only be provided as the availability of funds dictates. But by giving our
people title deeds and equity we will be making sure that they are able to
rise to the occasion, because they take pride in their possessions.
[Interjections.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon members, Botswana's
President Festus Mogae, has launched a scathing attack on his Zimbabwe
counterpart, Rubert Mugabe, for his failure to deal with the land
resettlement programme in his country in a peaceful way. Mogae said
regional leaders were becoming frustrated with the situation in Zimbabwe
because it is affecting their economies.

He singled out war veterans and the Harare administration's failure to deal
with the violent occupation of white farms as potential obstacles to peace
and stability in the region, while equally blaming commercial farmers for
refusing to relinquish land voluntarily. Mogae argued that the programme
would have been successful had it follwed the correct structural and legal
reform frameworks, instead of turning to violence. He believes that the
Abuja Agreement provides a good framework for the restoration of law and
order. The ACDP congratulates Mogae on courageously speaking out when
others have chosen to keep silent.

South Africa's land reform programme consists of land restitution, land
redistribution and tenure reform and its aim is to ensure the transfer of
30% of all agricultural land over a period of 15 years.
The ACDP recognises the importance of a successful land reform programme
and commends the hon the Minister for her and her department remaining
steadfast under pressure in their determination to uphold the rule of law
and to retain and improve existing standards of utilisation. With this in
mind, we encourage all South Africans to take up the challenge of working
together towards achieving a fair and just society for all South Africans.

Africa is a continent blessed with abundant resources and is capable of
feeding the entire world, yet poverty and hardship abound. The ADCP
believes that when our leaders and our Constitution acknowledge the God of
creation, not just my King, but the King of Kings, curses and poverty will
be lifted off of our land, making way for blessing and prosperity.

A wrong can never be put right if the same means are used simply to reverse
a situation. This is true when it comes to the rule of law, and parties
represented in Parliament have a responsibility to uphold law and order.

It has to be said, of course, that laws which violate God's law are not
legitimate. The Almighty God is a God of justice. We please Him when we do
what is right, just and fair, neither showing favouritism nor denying
justice to the poor. If we compromise in doing right, we will reap the
consequences; violence and suffering will continue to be our portion.

God, family and property are closely linked; if one is touched the others
are also touched. This is why socialism and communism target family and
private ownership of property in their opposition to God. Private ownership
of property was ordained by God and firmly grounded in His law. Now I will
impress members by quoting Karl Marx, and probably irritate members as
well. He wrote in the Communist Manifesto of 1847: ``The theory of the
communists may be summed up in a single sentence: Abolition of private
property''. He saw clearly that property is power; whoever controls
property has liberty and whoever surrenders it surrenders liberty.

God places this power and liberty in the family's hands and not the
state's. When the state grows in its control over property, it grows by the
same degree towards totalitarian power and tyranny will result. We cannot,
however, oversimplify the matter by seeing capitalism as an antidote to
socialism. All ``isms'' are man's futile attempt to exclude God and do
things our way. God's way does not fit our categories; it requires His
constant guidance and brings positive results and a nation blessed.

Mr G D SCHNEEMAN: Madam Speaker, comrades, hon members, over the past three
centuries countless millions of our people have been dispossessed of their
land. They were dispossessed of their land in the most brutal manner, which
resulted in hundreds of thousands of our people losing their lives, and
many others living without any security of tenure and without the knowledge
of where they will live tomorrow, living and yet not living, because they
were not able to enjoy a living experience of a place called home, not
being able to say, `` this is my home, my land'' and ``it will also be the
land and home for my children and their children''. For many hon members in
this House and millions of our people this was their daily living
experience.

Since 1994 our Government, the ANC-led Government, has been able to change
their previous living experience into a new living experience. Millions of
our people now have a place they call home. They have a home and land that
belongs to them. They have homes with water, sanitation and electricity,
which protects them from the rain and the sun; to put it simply, a home
called home.

The housing policy which the ANC-led Government has put in place not only
delivers a house, it also delivers land and the ownership thereof.
Beneficiaries receive a home and land that they can develop and shape
according to their needs. Over five million people have benefited from the
more than 1,2 million houses that have been built. These are homes with
water, sanitation and electricity. These are homes which have had an impact
on communities throughout our country. Communities' lives have been
changed, because they are able to live securely and have security of
tenure.

The People's Housing Process is a programme where communities and
individuals actively participate in the construction of their own homes.
The homes built are often bigger, better and built in the design they
choose. But what is most important is that the house and the land belong to
the beneficiary. In particular, I want to indicate that women are by far
the most active participants in the People's Housing Process. For the
people of South Africa this is a wonderful opportunity to actively take
part in helping communities and individuals to rebuild their lives. I would
encourage religious institutions, youth groups and other community
organisations to volunteer to help build homes in the PHP programmes in
their areas.

Rental housing is another programme which forms part of housing delivery.
The beneficiary has the option of just renting or renting with an option to
buy. Recently the national savings initiative was launched. This encourages
individuals and communities to save towards the building of their own
homes. The hostel redevelopment programme involves the conversion of
hostels into family units. The more than 350 000 council homes that have
been transferred to families living in them includes ownership of the land.
All of these programmes which I have alluded to - and there are others -
form part of the ANC-led Government's commitment to reducing homelessness
and to providing security of tenure.

The rapid land release programme is aimed at helping the poor settle on
permanent land. The land is serviced with water, sanitation and
electricity. Ownership of the land is transferred to the beneficiary. To
date, 32 839 hectares of land have been transferred through 2 114 projects.
The Gauteng Department of Housing will release 30 000 sites every year with
an objective of upgrading all informal settlements by the year 2004. This
will include the provision of title deeds and basic services.

This clearly indicates the ANC-led Government's commitment to creating a
better life for all through the delivery of land and housing. However, we
must ensure the integration of our cities. All people have the right to
live within cities, to live on land that is well located, to live in
suburbs which have access to amenities, and to live in suburbs which are
close to places of work.

The sad and true reality is that there are still citizens in our country
who do not want to see real integration. They want to see the vast majority
of the people of this country live far away from the suburbs, far away from
places of work. The question I want to ask is: Why? The answer is because
the majority of our people are black, poor and vulnerable.

I want to make an impassioned plea to those South Africans who continue to
act in this way to become part of our country. Take part in helping to
correct the wrongs of the past, in helping to build this country, in
helping the poor and vulnerable to achieve a better life, in helping them
to restore their dignity and self-worth. My plea is that we all accept each
other as equal human beings.

In my constituency of Randfontein, which is in the west end of Gauteng, we
continually have to deal with workers being evicted from plots and farms.
This in itself leads to homelessness and landlessness and often results in
the mushrooming of informal settlements. In each and every situation those
evicted are black, poor and vulnerable. Again I urge landowners to think
seriously about the actions that they take and reflect on the wellknown
saying that goes: ``Do unto others as you would have others do unto you''.

There is a new tendency that is starting to take place and that is that
landowners divide their properties into small stands and then charge people
a monthly fee to live there and erect a dwelling. However, they do not
provide services. In particular I wish to draw attention to the Zandspruit
area. This is an area which has sadly been in the news lately. I live in
that ward and I belong to the ANC branch in Zandspruit. Some of the
landowners around Zandspruit have embarked on this practice of dividing
their land into small plots. As a result, a few thousand people have moved
onto these properties. There are no services provided, no access to water,
no access to toilets. They have made money and we have heard reports
quoting figures of up to R600 000.

Now these landowners have turned around and are saying that Government must
purchase these properties and upgrade the area. Surely this is wrong. Is
this not an illegal land use practice? We call on such landowners to desist
from these practices which increase poverty, homelessness and landlessness.
They are playing a destructive role in our country. We call on them to join
us and make a positive contribution to the future of our country.

The housing policy we have in place requires that we address the needs of
the landless poor for landownership. Landownership by the poor is central
to the RDP policy. The UN Centre for Human Settlements has adopted a
resolution encouraging governments of the world to provide land for the
settlement of the poor. The global campaign for secure tenure was launched
two years ago in Durban in recognition of the work South Africa has done in
securing tenure for the poor.

In conclusion, I wish to quote from the speech of the UN Secretary-General,
Kofi Annan, to the General Assembly in November 2001:


  The world's people will judge us by our ability to perform specific
  tasks, not by the resounding speeches we make or the number of decisions
  we reach, but by the quality of those decisions and of the service we
  provide. For the sake of all those whom we hope to save, whether from
  terrorism, from war, from poverty, from disease or from environmental
  degradation, let us resolve that only the best is good enough. Let us
  equip ourselves so that in the future the best is what we give.

The reconstruction and development of our country is not just the
responsibility of the ANC. It is the responsibility of all South Africans.
Let us all roll up our sleeves and together build a better life, a better
country, a better continent, a better world and a better future.
[Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, a successful land reform programme is a
programme that addresses equitably the land needs of the people who need it
most. The challenge facing South Africa today is threefold: to allocate
land to the disadvantaged section of our society for residential purposes;
to allocate land to emerging farmers for commercial purposes; and to
accelerate the land restitution programme.

The question of land reform in South Africa is highly political and
contentious for a number of reasons, the chief reason being that many of
our people do not have access to land for residential purposes. The land is
mostly owned by the state and is also in the hands of private people. This
situation has also resulted in the proliferation of squatter camps and
thousands of our people are cramped in an area that can only accommodate a
fraction of the population that live there.

It should also be noted that political parties' rights to pursue the
policies of their choice should be balanced with the responsibility to
uphold the rule of law, no matter how political parties differ on policy
approach with regard to land issues. Political parties should promote
dialogue on policy issues affecting the country without compromising their
stand on these issues. We are not saying that to be responsible one has to
agree with what the Government is saying or to legitimise the Government's
land reform programme as it is.

We are entitled to listening to our people's needs for land. It is not a
secret that many of our people need land, and that land reform programmes
have to be accelerated to address this need. It is also the responsibility
of political parties to educate their members about policy-making processes
in Parliament. Above all, it is the responsibility of the political parties
represented in Parliament to operate within the bounds of law and uphold
the law. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Mr Chairperson, the land occupation in Bredell by the
landless, who in the midst of a severely cold winter did not have a place
to sleep, is not an isolated incident. The tragedy of this country is that
there are many Bredells. The African majority remain dispossessed - it is
landless, homeless and poor. Africans are the only people in this country
who live in filthy houses and unhealthy squatter camps. Many of these
pigsties bear the names of living pseudo-liberators of this country.

Equitable redistribution of land has been betrayed. Claiming land from 1913
consolidates land dispossessions of Africans. There is no land reform
programme that can come out of 13%, on land colonially allocated to the
African people in 1913. To blame the PAC for sympathising with the landless
and homeless is insensitive and treacherous in the extreme. The primary
contradiction of our liberation struggle and our ancestral wars was about
national colonialism and over the land opposition.

Instead of making the PAC the scapegoat for land occupation by the
frustrated landless African people, this Parliament must legislate against
the sale of our land to foreigners while our own people need land.
Excessive ownership of land by a few must be prohibited. One farmer in this
country is reputed to own farmland the size of Belgium or the state of
Maryland in America, or, closer to home, Lesotho. This is unacceptable to
the PAC and all the right-thinking people of the world. Bredell has exposed
those who claim to care for the poorest of the poor as hypocrites engaging
in political lumpenism and shedding crocodile tears. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Dr S E M PHEKO: Lest we forget, the rule of law goes hand in hand with
human rights such as housing and liberation from genocidal colonial
apartheid laws and land dispossession. Tiko ra hina! The land is ours!
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I wish to request
that when the presiding officer indicates to you that your time has
expired, you should recognise that your time has expired and not be in
breach of the call of the officer.

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Chairperson, fly-by-night political parties like
the PAC who are short of political programmes and programmes of action
spend their time on emotionalising the land issue. They have no programme
for addressing the inequalities. That is why they manipulate individuals,
including the aged, to attend to their desperate goals. They have enjoyed
championing the cause of adventurous individuals by mobilising around
illegal land occupations. They get involved in shack farming and land sales
on properties they do not own. Anarchy, irresponsible and opportunistic
action should have no room at all on our transformation agenda.

It is very difficult to address issues of land needs without putting them
within the context of what happened in the past. But it also does not help
much to be fixated on the wrongs of the past. It only limits one's chances
of resolving the problems of inequality in a sustainable manner.

My party, the ANC, understands these facts, and we have laid the foundation
with strategies for redressing the injustices of the past, of fostering
national reconciliation and stability, of understanding the economic
implications of strategies proposed and also ensuring that households do
access land as we forge on with the process of alleviating, and ridding
ourselves of, poverty. There are huge challenges that require extraordinary
measures through policies, legislation, programmes and procedures that will
enable us to empower the historically disadvantaged communities.

The South African political landscape lobbed groups and communities into
residential settlements that were patterned and serviced in line with
required racial norms, but the new dispensation, since its inception, has
been consistently re-examining the laws, policies and procedures and we are
now gradually changing these through a nonracial approach.

Deracialisation of landownership and settlement remains one of the biggest
challenges confronting the nation. Though our policies and programmes are
in place and are guiding us in the redistribution of land and services to
the historically disadvantaged, we still need a consolidated national
consensus and approach on how jointly, as a people, to speed up the
processes.

There are a number of crucial role-players linked to land, and they have
the power to determine how that land can be utilised. We have land that is
public and land that is private. So far state land has been distributed to
households through the Government's housing policy, which has currently
afforded more than 5 million people security of tenure. Different
Government programmes are directed towards improving the quality of life of
our people, and the rapid land release programme in housing has enabled
Government to release at least 32 839 hectares of land.

Through policies of the Land Affairs department, more land has been
allocated to the poor through redistribution and restitution programmes,
including tenure reform. Secure tenure has been central to Government's
housing programmes, because it is our understanding that providing
certainty to families greatly increases the value of their assets. It also
helps people to plan for a future. That in itself encourages them to invest
in their property. Secure tenure has also often had a greater multiplier
impact on improvements and income generation.

Through the Government housing capital subsidy, we have forged a
partnership with the urban and rural poor in encouraging people to take
charge of their lives. The poor are increasingly playing an active role as
agents of their own development. They build on their own, and they change
their circumstances. The homeless have proved that they can create,
innovate and also enhance what they have not just through skills imparted
to them, but also through teaching each other how to improve their lives.
Where there has been no lending from the banks, they have formed saving
schemes that are now growing into an instrument that will ultimately
empower and liberate them from the cycle of poverty. They are getting more
organised and more confident.

This partnership is growing by the day. It has moved from single-purpose
agreements to more institutionalised arrangements addressing issues of
interrelated long-term goals. We need a stronger interaction with the
business community as well, so that issues that commonly impact on
Government's work can be resolved with the participation of landowners. One
of these is the high land prices in cities caused by speculative
investments. These prices contribute to and perpetuate the construction of
homes away from the inner cities, where we already have available
amenities.

Sometimes we acquired suitable land, well located and technically
appropriate and available for residential development, but failed to
develop it owing to land costs. Potentially significant housing projects
have been stopped or delayed in the past owing to this problem. We have
competing needs such as open space and social facilities, and delays in
housing development processes have resulted in additional costs in terms of
holding the land. The financial viability of housing development is often
jeopardised by unforeseen delays that result in additional costs relating
to the servicing of bonds, rates and service charges, including security.

We need a joint exercise between relevant stakeholders to identify land
that is lying fallow, but which can be utilised at reasonable cost. A plan
of land supply and promotion of efficient administration of land matters is
also critical to our success. There are farmers, though, who have already
ceded or donated their land for housing development and this must be
applauded. We need more such patriots.

However, in affluent communities some residents have refused to share
neighbourhoods with poorer households, and continuality propagate the view
that poor neighbours bring in crime and unrefined habits. But the residents
of Dunsevern in Gauteng have proved that their million-rand mansions have
not declined owing to low-cost housing in their neighbourhood. What we need
in this country is a change of mind and attitude, which is necessary for
transformation and change.

Development located next to high-cost housing should not necessarily be
viewed as impacting negatively on valuations, but the developmental
potential of the land should rather be the issue. We still have problem
areas that need our attention, and one of these is the subjective nature of
valuations which complicate property price negotiations.

We still have to make sure that local public land audits are conducted so
that they help us to update and maintain the land database. This will also
enable us to verify suitable land for development purposes. It will help
identify well-located land in rural and urban areas that is technically
suitable and safe for housing.

We have to make sure that state land disposal processes will also help us
prioritise the release of land for low-cost housing. In all spheres of
government, officials should be involved in state land development
processes and be empowered to understand, catalyse and manage state land
disposal processes.

Gradually, the legacy of apartheid is being overcome. Water, electricity
and homes are reaching many, and will continue to do so until it reach even
those who do not have it.

In order to work at a more advanced pace and efficient level of delivery,
be it in land or other services, political stability and order should be
the order of the day. We are pleading with the PAC that this should be the
order of the day. Breaking the law through land occupations will only
consume the time that we all need to change the phase and character of the
country.

Recent research confirms the view that most families and individuals need
land for settlement purposes in the urban areas. That is where most job
opportunities exist and where infrastructure and services are accessible.
Rural areas have in the past been ignored and denied development
opportunities, hence migration to the cities at this considerably high
rate.

Our Integrated Rural Development Strategy and urban renewal programmes are
structured in a way that seeks to create a balance between rural and urban
dwellers. These strategies will ensure that needs are addressed in a much
more effective way and at an accelerated pace. These strategies have to be
given a chance to deliver to the poor. Our Government has delivered and
will continue to deliver. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, may I, at this point, compliment the hon B M
Komphela on his maiden speech.

Land reform has been an issue in South Africa for years now. Though its
main aim is to provide for land redistribution, restitution and tenure
reform, there are many concerns as to how to attain these ends
successfully.

Group areas, the colour bar, the dompas, land evictions, forced removals
and many other horrific apartheid abuses, squeezed people into little
locations, with minimal living space and exposing them to the most harsh
living conditions, with little or no sanitation system available. Our aim
is to correct this, or rather, to give back that which was forcibly taken
from us.

It is satisfying that a legal framework has been put in place so as to
facilitate land reform and avoid any illegal action in the process. Land
invasion is by no means the way to attain this, and those who fuel it
should be criticised for their ignorance.

The MF feels that this is by no means an easy task to accomplish. But with
the right system in place, and adequately, efficiently and successfully
implemented, the policies for land reform will meet with success, as any
policy would.

The importance of all sectors, be they civil society, NGOs or political
parties, in the establishment of a framework compliant with our
constitutional democracy, cannot be overemphasised. All efforts and actions
to address the issue of successful land reform are fully supported by the
MF, as long as policies are put in place and precautions taken. [Applause.]

Mr A J BOTHA: Chairperson, I am sorry that the hon the Minister for
Agriculture and Land Affairs is no longer here, because I would have liked
to congratulate her on an excellent land reform programme and also on her
ability to listen to other people, as this big conference that we will be
having at the end of the month in Durban illustrates.

Let me start by saying that the land settlement pattern in South Africa is
the result of historical migration and legal intervention. The original
population was displaced by the migration of more powerful peoples from
both the north and the south. During the first half of the 20th century,
legal impediments restricted the expansion of landownership almost
exclusively to whites. During the second half of the 20th century, black-
owned land was expropriated on a vast scale. The cumulative result was a
wholly unrepresentative land settlement pattern favouring whites.

The DA, together with the vast majority of the population of South Africa,
believes that this untenable situation requires dramatic reform in
landownership.

There is a tendency to regard state-owned land as the primary target for
land reform. Clearly such land, ranging in extent from one million hectares
to one and a half million hectares, should not be excluded. However, since
this is essentially undeveloped land suitable mainly for extensive grazing,
the necessary infrastructural development to put it into use will be very
costly. Additional land for land reform must therefore be sought mainly in
the commercial sector.

Commercial agricultural land in South Africa is privately owned and
privately farmed. Land reform should likewise be privatised. Anybody who
disputes this need only examine the present experience of the Government
programme to privatise state assets. Most importantly, the management,
mentoring and training of emerging farmers must be privatised.

A very wise man long ago advised that centres of management excellence
should be established, from which we should modernise and commercialise
traditional agriculture. Every single commercial farming enterprise in
South Africa is in fact such a centre of management excellence. Otherwise
South Africa would not be one of only seven countries in the world that are
net exporters of food and fibre. In South Africa's case this is more
remarkable given our water-scarce status.

Many of these farming enterprises are already involved in land reform in a
variety of ways. But I would like to add another one that I believe could
contribute markedly and is not at present being utilised. I am referring to
insolvent or imminently insolvent enterprises, of which there are an
alarmingly large number at the moment. An immediate concern that would be
raised is that insolvent enterprises would prove unsuitable or unprofitable
for land reform.

The reality is different, because in most cases it was the sudden change in
the marketing environment that placed many enterprises on the wrong side of
the interest curve or debt- equity ratio, from which they simply could not
escape: Remove the debt burden through land reform and many, if not most,
would be highly profitable again. The great advantage of the proposal is
that the whole enterprise can be taken over as a going concern, including
the farmer, the employees, the livestock and equipment. Not only will the
movable assets be acquired at a fraction of the cost of new assets, but the
manager trainer, in the form of the erstwhile farmer, and candidate
emergent farmers in the form of the erstwhile employees, are all in place,
thereby saving on relocation costs and trauma as well as huge difficulties
in the selection process.

A special development trust or some other suitable body can be established
and the contractual management undertaken by an agency such as a merchant
bank, to which farmers in financial difficulties or facing imminent
foreclosure can apply to join the land reform programme. The advantages for
employees of such a farm are obvious in that they become candidate emergent
farmers instead of facing eviction after a bankruptcy dispersal sale of the
farm. Most farmers who face bankruptcy not only face eviction and
unemployment, but are probably unemployable when they are beyond middle
age. The opportunity to remain on the farm, securely employed on a
performance-based contract, by the land reform process would be a huge
incentive to make it work.

Given the very large percentage of commercial agriculture in financial
difficulties, such a programme can contribute to land reform not only on a
large scale but also very quickly. Most importantly, everybody should
contribute to a positive climate for land reform by avoiding
generalisations of negative elements that obviously do exist, as though
these elements portray the norm. Land reform is such a crucial element in
the normalisation of our society that it should be above party-politicking
and all should contribute to depicting the majority of existing commercial
farmers in their true light, as reasonable people, not as demons out to
deny others their lawful rights.
In conclusion, it must be emphasised that agriculture, which now
contributes only 4% towards the GDP, cannot solve the poverty and
unemployment problems of the majority of our population. To suggest so
would be to raise expectations which cannot be realised and would do a
serious disservice to this most important duty of our nation.

I hope people will not laugh at me when I pronounce the name incorrectly
again. Mohlomphehi, ntate Komphela. [Hon Mr Komphela], laat ek u verseker
dat die wil om 'n sukses te maak van die grondhervormingsproses daar is en
saam sal ons dit regkry. Kom kuier gerus die vakansie vir my op die plaas
en dan kan ons saam daarna kyk. [Applous.] [let me assure you that the will
is there to make a success of the land reform process. Together we can
achieve this. Do come and visit me on my farm during the holidays and then
we can take a look at it together. [Applause.]]

Mr J DURAND: Mr Chairperson, in a country where 87% of the people until
recently had access to, and not really ownership of, only 13% of the land,
everyone should admit that something is amiss.

The entire subcontinent of Africa was colonised by European powers. Land
ownership changed without legal transfer into the hands of the colonisers.
The indigenous people had lost all rights to the land. In 1913 the Natives'
Land Act was passed, which legally destroyed successful black and coloured
farmers. Access to land was made virtually impossible. Farmers lost their
land and were forced to go to the cities and try to earn a living for which
they were not trained in a hostile environment.

We must individually and collectively identify the obstacles to meaningful
land reform in our region. Apart from the lessons to be drawn from the
actual experiences of land reforms, or the lack thereof in Southern Africa,
it is vital that we explore pressing land issues such as the role of land
restitution, the importance of gender parity in questions of property
rights, sustainable rural development and how best to approach land held in
tribal or communal trusts. These issues form the core of what is far more
than just another regional talk-shop. They constitute the basis of a real
African Renaissance, a move away from the rhetoric and bluster of socialism
towards concrete action plans and real delivery.

Land reform is such an important issue that we should try our utmost to get
Government and opposition parties working together towards this national
goal, and to seek broad national consensus on the approach.

In die Wes-Kaap is daar voorbeelde van hoe die staat, die privaatsektor en
plaaswerkers saam oplossings gevind het. Die praktyk waarvolgens
plaaswerkers saam met kommersiële landboubeleggers en entrepreneurs aandele
in 'n gemeenskaplike boerderyvennootskap kan bekom, is 'n aantreklike
proposisie wat al in die Wes-Kaap stewig posgevat het. Daarvolgens help 'n
ervare entrepreneur met boerderybestuurskundigheid om 'n onderneming
winsgewend te vestig en uit te bou. Só word die herverdeelde landbougrond
met die hulp van plaaswerkers of opkomende boere meer produktief ontwikkel.
As aandeelhouers word hulle in staat gestel om hul lewensgehalte te
verbeter en word hulle blootgestel aan die soms vyandige landbou-omgewing
en sy werklikhede. Dié blootstelling gaan somtyds ook gepaard met 'n goeie,
steil leerkurwe.

Die plaaswerkers, of opkomende boere, finansier hul aandelekapitaal uit die
R15 000 wat die Departement van Grondsake beskikbaar stel, en dit kan nou
gedoen word deur middel van die sogenaamde geïntegreerde program. Dié skema
staan op vier bene, naamlik die Departement van Grondsake,
kredietfasiliteite vir landelike hervorming, handelsbanke en die Nuwe Boere
Ontwikkelingsmaatskappy, 'n waagkapitaalfinansier met sy hoofkantoor in
Durbanville.

Die bogenoemde ontwikkelingsmaatskappy is gemoeid met die ontwikkeling van
opkomende boere. Hulle belê in projekte met 'n goeie verdienstepotensiaal
en sal hul ná 'n tydperk winsgewend onttrek wanneer die projek suksesvol op
sy eie bene staan. Die boerderyprojekte word as maatskappye of trusts
bestuur en word deur die direkteure of trustees beheer. Die plaaswerkers of
opkomende boere wat aandeelhouers in die plaas is, dien ook in die
direksie. Winste wat uit hierdie projekte gemaak word, kan uitbetaal word
en die trustees kan besluit wat om daarmee te doen.

Die Land Reform Credit Facility, die LRCF, is in 1999 deur die Departement
van Grondsake gestig. Dit is aanvanklik gekapitaliseer met R63 miljoen.
Geld dáárvoor is deur die Departement van Grondsake en die Europese Unie
beskikbaar gestel. Die LRCF stel lenings aan banke en beleggers beskikbaar,
met uitgestelde terugbetalings. Sedert sy stigting het die LRCF lenings ter
waarde van R26 miljoen aan agt aandeelvennootskapprojekte goedgekeur, ses
in die Wes-Kaap en twee in Mpumalanga. Lenings word aan banke en beleggers
beskikbaar gestel, wat weer op hul beurt die risiko moet dra deur lenings
vir projekte beskikbaar te stel. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[In the Western Cape there are examples of how the state, the private
sector and farmworkers have found solutions together.

The practice according to which farmworkers, together with commercial
agricultural investors and entrepreneurs, can acquire shares in a communal
farming partnership, is a lucrative proposition that has already been
firmly established in the Western Cape. In this way an experienced
entrepreneur assists with farm management expertise in order to establish
an enterprise profitably. In this way the redistributed agricultural land
can be developed more productively with the assistance of farmworkers or
emerging farmers. As shareholders they are empowered to improve their
quality of life and they are exposed to the sometimes hostile agricultural
environment and its realities. This exposure sometimes goes hand in hand
with a good, steep learning curve.
The farmworkers or emerging farmers finance their share capital with the
R15 000 that the Department of Land Affairs makes available, and this can
now be done by means of the so-called integrated programme. This scheme has
four branches, namely the Department of Land Affairs, credit facilities for
rural reform, commercial banks and the New Farmers Development Company, a
venture capital financier with its head office in Durbanville.

The abovementioned development company is involved with the development of
emerging farmers. They invest in projects with a sound earning potential
and, after a certain period, they will profitably withdraw once the project
is successfully established. Farming projects are managed as companies or
trusts and are controlled by the directors or trustees. The farmworkers or
emerging farmers who are shareholders in the farm also serve on the board
of directors. Profits that are made from these projects can be paid out and
the trustees can decide what to do with it.

The Land Reform Credit Facility, LRCF, was established in 1999 by the
Department of Land Affairs. It was initially capitalised with R63 million.
Money for this was made available by the Department of Land Affairs and the
European Union. The LRCF makes loans available to banks and investors, with
deferred repayments. Since the its establishment the LRCF has approved
loans to the value of R26 million to eight share partnership projects, six
in the Western Cape and two in Mpumalanga. Loans are made available to
banks and investors who, in turn, must carry the risk by making loans
available for projects.]

I trust that we will continue this process of land reform in South Africa
and continually engage in vibrant policy dialogues between role-players. We
have a responsibility to strategise and brainstorm to find effective ways
to deal with this problem within a framework of certain principles. The
principles of a free-market economy with a social conscience; the promotion
and protection of human rights and the rule of law; the expansion of
property ownership to the landless and previously disadvantaged; the
protection of property rights; a commitment to multiparty democracy, and
the use of peaceful means to achieve change have proved to be successful
around the world.

Our approach to land reform should stand in direct contrast to that of
Zimbabwe, whose approach is characterised by a disregard for the rule of
law and property rights. It stands in direct contrast with the approach
that has led to the destruction of agricultural opportunities, investment
confidence and food security in many African countries and in the rest of
the world. Our approach to land reform is a responsible one, aimed at
protecting private property, expanding property ownership and making
maximum use of opportunities for the development of the agricultural
sector, always bearing in mind the imperative of ensuring that this
development does not occur at the expense of the environment.

Without properly developing the agricultural sector as an integral part of
our rural land reform process, we will not be able to kick-start rural
economic development and make property available. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Before I recognise the next
speaker, let me say that the House is too orderly. Could I please request
hon members to stick to decorum. [Interjections.]

Mr B A RADEBE: Deputy Chairperson, hon members and comrades, this debate
comes at the right time, just before the start of the constituency period.
As we go back to service our constituencies, it is important that we go and
tell the truth about the state and history of our country. That is why I
will start this debate by telling the truth about what happened before the
indigenous people of South Africa experienced landlessness.

An HON MEMBER: Khuluma, Baba! [Speak, Father!]

Mr B A RADEBE: In the whole of South Africa there was always land to cater
for all the needs of our people. That is the reason why it was always the
norm that when one person moved from the service of one king, he was given
land and stock by the new king he was to serve. This was done to banish
hunger, landlessness and poverty and no orphans were left destitute,
because members of society had ubuntu, and took care of one another.

This trend was reversed when the indigenous people hosted a certain group
of people who came from abroad. Although they treated those settlers well
by giving them land and stock, these settlers never appreciated that
generosity, kindness and hospitality. Instead, they demanded more land and
stock from their host, the indigenous people.

The settlers also recruited more people from their land of origin. Driven
by greed, they tried to rob the indigenous people of their land. This led
to the first resistance wars, which were gallantly fought by kings such as
Hintsa, Moshoeshoe, Cetswayo, Sekhukhune and others.

When some of the kings, like Hintsa, were decapitated, and others sent to
prison, the young generation continued to fight. The last resistance war
was fought by Bambatha and was against the herd tax. Although the
indigenous people were eventually defeated, they continued to live
peacefully with their settlers.

After the formation of the Union of South Africa the government of the day
passed Act 27 of 1913, which was entitled the Native Land Act. By
coincidence, that Act was assented to on 16 June 1913 by the then governor-
general.

If hon members remember correctly, that was not only the day on which Black
people were enslaved to land, but also the day on which the youth of South
Africa rose against the apartheid regime to fight for their rights.
[Interjections] [Applause.]

That land Act described the ``native'' as ``any person or female who is a
member of an aboriginal race or tribe of Africa, and shall further include
any company or the board of persons, corporate or unincorporate, and the
persons who have the controlling interest.'' This Act effectively
racialised the land question in South Africa. The first section of the land
Act restricted transactions relating to land between natives and other
persons, that is whites.

This meant that no native was allowed to enter into any agreement or
transaction for the purchase, hire or acquisition of any land from any
other person who was white, except for his own native land. The natives
were supposed to acquire land only in a scheduled native area. If there was
deviation from this, the permission of the governor-general was to be
sought first.

The governor-general would institute a commission to investigate such a
transaction. If any person was found in contravention of this Act, they
were fined 100 pounds. This was the first legalised land grab in South
Africa, which condemned the indigenous people to 13% of the South African
land and gave 80% of the land to whites. This land grab exacerbated the
land hunger and poverty of the indigenous people.

The indigenous people, having experienced a further blow by their exclusion
from the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, formed their own
parliament in 1912, which was valiantly led by Langalibalele Dube. This
parliament was all-inclusive, because it involved all the kings of
different tribes in South Africa. It was used to petition the Queen of
England and the South African government. This parliament of the African
people was the African National Natives Congress, which later became the
African National Congress. This parliament of the people provides the
strategic political leadership to the African people to this day and will
do so for many years to come.

In 1955, after many years of petitioning, the ANC called a congress of the
people where the Freedom Charter was adopted. What was significant about
that congress of the people was that it included all the different racial
groups of South Africa. The preamble of the Charter declares that South
Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white.

Clause 4 of the Charter made a clarion call that the land should be shared
among those who work it; restriction of landownership on a racial basis
should be ended; and all land should be redivided among those who work it
to banish famine and land hunger. This fundamental principle of the Freedom
Charter was adopted during the constitution-making process that took place
between 1994 and 1996. That is why even section 25 of the Constitution also
provides for protection of the property rights of the people.

Through the Departments of Agriculture and Land Affairs, the Government has
initiated various programmes of land restitution and land reform. The land
restitution involves the people who were forcefully removed from their land
by the apartheid regime. Through the Land Claims Commission the people
launched their claims, which the commission investigated. The Land Claims
Court settled the claims. This process was necessary for transparency where
there were disputes and it also provided for an appeal process so that no
person could be unfairly disadvantaged.

The administrative process of settling land claims was adopted to speed up
those claims in which there were no disputes. This led to thousands of
people who were staying in places like Sophiatown receiving the once-off
payment grants for compensation of the land they lost through forced
removals. This legal framework is very important to ensure future stability
and peace in the country.

The land reform programme involves land redistribution for agricultural
purposes and community settlement. At the centre of the programme is the
deracialisation of agriculture. This involves the transference of state
land to small-scale farmers and previously disadvantaged commercial
farmers. For example, in the eastern Free State, 55 000 of the 60 000
hectares of state land were transferred to emerging farmers and
municipalities for redistribution purposes.

Since the Charter demanded that the state help the peasants with
implements, seeds, tractors and dams to till the soil, the Department of
Land Affairs introduced the subprogramme, Land Redistribution Agricultural
Development, LRAD. Through this programme the emerging farmers are helped
to get land, and are assisted with start-up capital and skills in order to
become commercial farmers. The role of the white commercial farmers is also
important, since they are the people who have the skills and land to help
the black farmers.

Since the formation of Agri-SA, a lot of farmers have contributed
positively to the land redistribution programme. For example, a farmer in
the North West, Roger Roman of Hartebeespoort Dam, gave up 65 hectares of
his farm to 12 families residing and working on his farm for settlement
purposes. Already 12 low-cost houses have been built on this farm at a cost
of R132 000. This is what Mr Roger Roman had to say, and I quote:


  I have learnt that, as farmers, we have an opportunity, especially those
  of us who got the farms during apartheid, to contribute in giving land
  back to the Africans. Our Government has given us an alternative, unlike
  in Zimbabwe.

People like Roger Roman must really be commended for playing a positive
role in changing the legacy of apartheid.

During the state-of-the-nation address by President Thabo Mbeki, he called
on all organs of civil society to work together with Government to speed up
change and fight poverty. Former organisations like Agri-SA and Nafu, had
worked together with an  official of the President's to make a sector for
agriculture, since it was identified by the President as one of the sectors
which would help economic growth in South Africa.

This sector plan emphasises bridging of conflicts and the creation of a
shared vision. This involved the elimination of apartheid deficits in
landownership patterns by increasing access to land by black farmers. The
core strategies of the plan are participation, competitiveness and
sustainability. Participation would involve the Government, farmers, the
Farmworker Union and the banking sector, like the Land Bank, in speeding up
land restitution. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Chairperson, I would like to
say to Dene Smuts that I will take into consideration her concern.

Chairperson and hon members, I must say that the way in which members
contributed to the debate has been very constructive. They have raised
issues of concern to them and, I am sure, to all our constituencies. The
challenge is for us to move with speed in dealing with the legacy of our
past. There is room for all of us to participate in a constructive manner
to find solutions to the problems that we face.

It is my view that we have all turned the corner as South Africans. It
might be that some instances, such as Bredell and many others, have
continually reminded us of our interdependence as a society; that while
some people are poor and others rich, neither of the two can be happy and
comfortable.

I would like to share with the House some of the work that we have done
with various nongovernmental organisations, and with farmers and the
business sector. In their small way, they have participated in ensuring
that the various communities are assisted in actually dealing with the
challenges, also taking into consideration the Government's programmes.

I want to highlight a few. The Border Rural Committee, Inkunzi Development
and many others, some of whom are national land committee affiliates, must
be commended on the role they played in assisting the land claimants as
well as farmworkers.

I also want to say that it was worrying, at the beginning of this year and
at midyear, to hear some of the statements that were made by the land
committee supporting the land invasions. We have raised our concern with
this organisation, because we believe it has a critical role to play. If it
is to do that constructively, we will be able to work together in finding
solutions.

I also want to thank individual members of this House for the way in which
some of them quietly did their work in their constituencies. They have
always touched base with us and the Ministry in finding solutions to
speeding up the land process.

I also want to say that the relationship we have developed with Agri SA in
trying to find constructive solutions in dealing with the problem has been
commendable.

Lastly, I need to highlight the role played by and the contribution made by
some traditional leaders, whom have been commended. I also want to
highlight the role played by Chief Shongwe in Mpumalanga who was able to
release many hectares of land for agricultural development, because he
appreciated, as a chief, that if his society is poor, he will never be
successful in governing them.

These are the ways in which we as South African citizens, in my view, will
continually have to find ways of working together for the betterment of our
society. Criticism is necessary at times, but that criticism must be
constructive - not to destroy but to build. It is sad that one of the
parties in this House, the PAC, sought to come and raise many issues of
concern, but decided to leave and not dare to listen to others who had very
constructive suggestions. I hope next time they will be able to be part of
all of us in finding a solution for the challenge we face. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                               WORLD AIDS DAY

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, I am glad to have been given this
opportunity to make this statement, just two weeks before World Aids Day.
The theme of this year's World Aids Day celebration is ``I care. Do you?''
I want to assure members that our Government cares and this is witnessed in
the progress we have been making in responding to HIV/Aids. As a country,
we firmly embrace the ABC principles of abstinence, faithfulness and condom
use a part of a comprehensive approach to our efforts.

We will soon increase the number of female condoms' pilot sites from 114 to
360. We should all be proud that life skills and the HIV/Aids education
programme are now a compulsory part of the curriculum and will be available
in all primary and secondary schools by the year 2003. In the last year,
the Department of Health collaborated with the Department of Education to
develop resource materials on life skills and HIV/Aids education for
parents, to ensure that messages provided in schools can be enforced within
the home. There has been a dramatic increase in calls to the HIV/Aids
helpline as a result of our public awareness efforts. Legitimate calls for
help to the helpline have increased by more than 130% in the last two
years.

A new tender for the information, education and communication arm of the
HIV/Aids and TB programme was awarded early this year to three agencies,
which amounts to R90 million over two years. This mass communication
campaign will focus on safer and healthier sexual behaviour, as well as
care, support, openness and acceptance of people living with Aids in the
community, and the promotion of awareness about Government initiatives and
how to access them. This year we expanded access to voluntary HIV
counselling and testing. Three hundred and twenty-five sites have been
identified for the implementation of the strategy. Thirty percent of these
are already operational.

There are benefits to knowing one's status, whether positive or negative.
For people who are HIV positive, the post-test counselling provides
important information on issues such as treatment, care and support
opportunities, nutrition and prevention of further transmission, in order
to improve the quality of life. For those who are HIV-negative, the post-
test counselling focuses on those lifestyle choices that will ensure that
the person remains HIV-negative.

The expansion of HIV counselling and testing sites is, thus, an important
policy direction for health. We are targeting 25% of the adult population
by the year 2003. Last year, I launched the HIV/Aids STI strategic plan for
South Africa 2000-2005, in order to deal comprehensively with HIV/Aids. To
this end, I have also launched nine HIV/Aids-related guidelines in October
last year. These include guidelines for rapid HIV testing, managing HIV
infections in children, management of HIV positive pregnant women, feeding
infants of HIV-positive mothers, tuberculosis and HIV, treatment of
opportunistic infections in adults, ethics in HIV/Aids clinical and
epidemiological research, nutrition for people living with TB and HIV/Aids
and other chronic debilitating conditions. To further strengthen the
ability of health care workers to correctly diagnose and manage the health
manifestations of HIV/Aids, we have allocated more resources in the last
year to the training of health care workers on those guidelines.

The debate around treatment for people with HIV/Aids in South Africa
dominates the media. It is also characterised by gross misrepresentation.
The wrong impression is being created that individuals who are HIV-positive
have no access to treatment within the public health care system. The
reality is that the Government has placed its emphasis in treatment on
improving quality of life through the effective management and treatment of
opportunistic infections and sexually transmitted infections.

However, there is also no running away from the fact that the cost of
antiretrovirals is still prohibitively high. We have to attend to the
issues related to poor compliance, which leads to speedy resistance. In
this regard I refer hon members to the article by Simon Barber, a
Washington Post correspondent in today's Business Day.

I want to reiterate that Government continues to place primary importance
on improving quality of life through the effective treatment and management
of opportunistic infections and sexually transmitted infections. We have
reduced syphilis infections among women attending the antenatal public
health facilities by more than 50% over a period of two years. We also
continue to address issues of treatment within the public health sector. I
can assure hon members that treatment of acute and chronic opportunistic
infections is provided to every person in public health care facilities,
irrespective of HIV status.

World Aids Day marks the first anniversary of the Diflucan partnership that
our Government entered into with the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. We have
facilitated, through this partnership getting the offer of free Diflucan
extended to other countries in the SADC region. Some countries are now
interacting with Pfizer in this regard.

Misinformation and very negative perceptions created around Government
policy with regard to treatment undermine such progress that has been made
in caring for people living with Aids. The establishment of the prevention
of mother-to-child transmission programmes in 2001 will bring hope to many
mothers and babies. This project will provide the Department of Health with
an opportunity to identify gaps in the delivery of health care in the
context of mother-to-child transmission programmes.

Despite the criticism of this programme, we have placed great thought into
the actual package of care provided to women and their babies. All 18 MTCT
sites and the 153 access points are now operational. At the last count,
approximately 7 000 women had accepted the VCT programme in the MTCT sites
and approximately 500 babies have been born into the programme.
The comprehensive package of care for MTCT includes the provision of HIV
counselling and testing, breast milk substitutes for women who choose not
to breastfeed, multivitamins for pregnant women to ensure that their health
status during pregnancy is elevated, nevirapine for both mother and infant
during birth and the treatment of any opportunistic infections during and
after birth for both mother and child.

Already the information obtained from these MTCT sites have highlighted
some of the challenges in implementing such a programme and the
implications for wide-scale rollout.

The main challenges relate to the lack of adequate space to ensure
confidential HIV counselling and testing, inadequate staffing levels to
promote HIV counselling and testing, the need for support groups,
especially for women who choose to formula feed, the impact of lack of
access to water, electricity and transport on the efficiency of the
intervention, and poor uptake and coverage in some of the sites, despite
the clamour for the immediate expansion of this programme to all pregnant
women. The pilot programme does provide for an opportunity to gather
essential data to properly inform policy for scaling up such a programme.
It is unfortunate that this approach is continuously presented as a sign of
not caring, because I sincerely believe that when it comes to women and
children, the record of the ANC and our Government speaks for itself.
[Interjections.] I want to report to this House that our focus is on the
outcome, which should be HIV-negative, healthy babies at the ages of 18 to
24 months. This Government cares about the people with HIV/Aids and babies
born of HIV-positive mothers. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that mothers
stay well for a long time and that their babies are free from HIV and are
healthy. [Interjections.]

We are piloting home-based care. This we are doing in collaboration with
the Departments of Agriculture and Social Development. A rapid appraisal of
home-based care projects in existence is currently in progress. Based on
this report, existing projects will be strengthened and over 200 new home-
based initiatives will be opened very soon. A tender to provide home-based
care kits is already in the pipeline. We provide information to the public
on issues relating to stigma, particularly in the workplace, caring for
people with HIV/Aids and basic information on HIV/Aids.
I am happy to report that the reported underspending on the Aids budget has
been drastically reduced this year, from 40% last year to 26% this year.
This clearly shows that we are making good progress in addressing the
problems of slow tender and procurement procedures, including slow delivery
by contractors, which the department has been facing for a number of years.

We are concerned about issues of quality, especially when it comes to
condoms being distributed through the public health care system. I would
like to commend the South African Bureau of Standards for the sterling work
they did in certifying the condoms that were purchased. I am happy to
report that within Government and civil society significant progress has
been made in operationalising the strategy plan.

We are engaged in a process of ensuring that health workers are better
trained and prepared for dealing with HIV and Aids. One should remember
that most of our health worker professionals were trained when there was no
HIV and Aids. In the past six months we have trained 100 health care
workers with regard to HIV/Aids guidelines in the workplace with funds
provided by the EU. There is no doubt that Government alone will not do
much to reduce the impact of HIV and Aids.

We have entered into a training partnership with the nurses' organisation,
Denosa, which includes the distribution of fact sheets on HIV and Aids. The
interaction with the unions and the training provided to shop stewards to
ensure adequate levels of HIV knowledge are amongst the work that we do.
This year we are funding NGOs to the tune of R28 million.

I want to encourage all members of Parliament to participate fully in the
coming World Aids Day celebrations. A major aspect of the celebration will
be the lighting of a flame of life at 7 pm on 1 December 2001. [Time
expired.][Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! One hon member has suggested
to me that it is past his bedtime. I suggest that he should perhaps look to
the Whip for a sleeping bag to provide some relief.

Mrs S V KALYAN: Mr Chairperson and hon members, in South Africa being
diagnosed HIV positive is a death sentence. With no cure or treatment, all
that those diagnosed as being HIV positive can expect is discrimination,
stigmatisation, ostracism, unemployment and long, lingering suffering while
watching one's family members struggling to take care of themselves. For
most people it is better not to be tested.

There are very few areas of our lives that are not affected by HIV/Aids,
irrespective of gender, race, culture or religion. There are only two kinds
of people in South Africa, those infected by HIV/Aids and those affected by
it. It is estimated that approximately 4,7 million people in South Africa
are infected by HIV and that by 2010 about 2,5 million children under the
age of 15 will be orphaned by Aids. Our infection rate is close to 1 700
per day and the Department of Health puts Aids-related deaths at about 700
per day.

Three main reasons for this bleak picture can be identified. Firstly, South
Africa is in denial about the depth of the epidemic. Secondly, we lack a
coherent, unified approach, and thirdly, the epidemic has become a
political tool.

Brazil's Aids programme is considered to be one of the most successful in
the world and that is because it has a strong, unwavering political
commitment. President Mbeki's stance on HIV/Aids is puzzling, to say the
least. Brazil is a developing country, yet has managed to drop its HIV/Aids
mortality rate by 50% simply because it has provided free antiretroviral
treatment for all its citizens who have HIV/Aids since 1997.

The high cost of antiretroviral drugs has long been cited as a barrier to
treatment. While the Government is engaging in denials and distractions,
the DA is offering solutions. The DA proposes two key steps which should be
taken immediately to cut costs. Firstly, we should introduce an amendment
to the Patents Act to allow instant access to generic drugs in a national
health emergency. We believe that the Aids crisis in South Africa is
undoubtedly a national emergency and by declaring an emergency the
Government would be able to authorise the competitive sector to supply
particular types of patents relevant to resolving the emergency.

The Minister cites the cost factor again in that medication is not
available to all. She omits to mention that a pharmaceutical company has
offered neviropine free for the next five years. A recent survey
commissioned by the Department of Health on the costing of the mother-to-
child transmission programme states that the cost will be less than 1% of
the total Health budget, and that the benefits far outweigh the risk.

Provision of antiretrovirals is well within South Africa's capabilities. We
have no real excuses to sit back and watch people die, nor can we justify
the R4,137 million roll-over on the Government's part, money set aside for
the Government Aids action plan.

The second proposal of the DA is to remove VAT on essential medicines. Many
countries around the world exclude medicines entirely from the tax net,
including the UK, Sweden, Ireland and Austria. South Africa must do the
same. We propose that VAT on all drugs on the EDL be removed, and the EDL
should be amended to include ARV. I would like to compliment the Joint
Monitoring Committee on the Improvement of the Quality of Life and the
Status of Women on its report on how best South Africa can address the
impact of HIV/Aids on women and girls. Well done on breaking the silence.
I would also like to congratulate the Treatment Action Campaign on
receiving a prestigious international award from MTV called ``Free Your
Mind''.

In conclusion, I would like to call on all members to support the DA's
proposed amendment to the Patents Act and make a difference. Instead of
uttering meaningless platitudes and lighting candles, let us shred the
myths and light the way collectively in the partnership that Government so
often refers to. [Applause.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Chair, in 1981 doctors identified a syndrome and called it
Aids. Now, 20 years on, as we approach World Aids Day, we know a great deal
about the cause and need only the will to contain it. Recently we have seen
the world unite in the wake of a terrorist threat and act in a focused
fashion to eradicate it.

Where Aids is concerned, the United Nations has pledged its support and
would rally the world to help us fight the scourge, provided we have a
clear plan of action. First and foremost, let us eradicate contradictions
in our policy. The worst one centres around our human rights priorities.
They elevate the right to privacy above the rights to safety, to
information, to treatment and to no unfair discrimination. This sets in
motion a chain of contradictions. We have drafted laws and regulations that
foster secrecy, and the most crucial of these surrounds testing. Testing is
one way to roll back denial.

The budget for Aids is a minute 0,08% of the national Budget. To date, of
R200 million budgeted, only R105,5 million is spent. Funding NGOs is
difficult, but funding Government work in clinics, hospitals and schools
should be easy, provided we have commitment, clear programmes of action and
no confusion about who is responsible for what.

Our current approach to testing promotes secrecy. It is done in selected
clinics and pilot programmes are only gradually being expanded. We demand
one-on-one counselling, for which there is not enough staff, and we do most
surveillance with anonymous testing. No wonder a mother who passed on Aids
to her baby is suing Government for not informing her she had HIV after she
had tested positive. We should test for Aids as routinely as for a full
blood count. We should do group pretest counselling, and one-on-one
counselling if people test positive, and deny patients the choice of
refusing to know their results.
There is another contradiction with respect to patient privacy. Doctors are
required to withhold positive test results from a sex partner or spouse.
That implies becoming a partner in homicide. We share information about TB
and cancer, why do we not do it with Aids and roll back denial? The more
people who know and talk openly, the less prejudice they will face.

We even shelter rapists and prisoners from testing, claiming it invades
their right to privacy. We also fail the public in having laws that make it
difficult to prosecute those who negligently pass on Aids. The criminal law
puts the onus on the victim to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she was
negligently or wilfully infected by a particular person. Our vacuous
approach to testing renders this virtually impossible. The civil law is
costly, because it requires the infected person to pay for their own
defence, and their partner or spouse would probably not pay the damages
awarded.

Another obvious way to promote openness is to offer antiretroviral
treatment. For this we require huge funding outlets and an efficient
infrastructure, which we lack. We do not need to distribute drugs to
everyone. We can source medicines free or at rock-bottom prices, and we can
work with any number of donors or private teams who are waiting in the
wings. Let us stop talking and do it. The first people to receive these
medicines must be pregnant women, newborn infants, children and rape
victims.

Support for orphans and home-based care require a complete rethink of
constitutional requirements. At present, these do not place authority,
capacity, financial resources and accountability in the hands of those best
placed to deal with the crisis, the people on the ground at local and
provincial levels. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your speaking time
has expired.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Deputy Chair, let me just say that pragmatism in Aids will
unite us, and allow me ... [Interjections.]

previously asked you to abide by the ruling of the presiding officer. You
cannot proceed beyond the time that is allocated to you. [Interjections.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: I merely wished to wish you well over the Ramadan fast.
[Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Hamba! [Go!]

Dr S J GOUS: Chair, it is already late in the evening both for this
Parliament and for Aids, but thanks anyway for this opportunity to promote
World Aids Day. However, it is our position that it should be World Aids
Day every day. All we have to do is to create some hope, and it is now very
clear that in South Africa one is either infected or one will be affected
by Aids.

We experienced the epidemic in three waves. The first wave would be that of
HIV infection and after about eight years the second were of Aids
sufferers, in other words, sick patients. Then after another two years, the
third wave of a horrible, undignified and untimely death.

Unfortunately, at the same time, the first and second waves continue
unabated. An early visit to a state or private hospital or a mortuary will
confirm that the epidemic is now in full force and the reality is therefore
that we can no longer afford any form of denial.

While we are waiting for a cure or vaccine, which appears to be elusive,
everything possible must be done to stem this tide, and absolutely no
effort must be spared in the prevention of the disease.

Firstly, we must educate, educate, and educate. Secondly, we must promote
the ABC, which we know so well: abstain, be faithful, and condomise, and we
can add a `D' to this, ``die if you do not''. Thirdly, regarding mother-to-
child transmission prevention and accidential exposure, which would include
rape, it is now clear that antiretrovirals after rape are no more an
option, but an obligation.

As far as treatment is concerned, we have to look at voluntary counselling
and testing, which are becoming imperative. We have to expand home-based
care. It is absolutely essential, because it is obvious that our hospitals
are already overflowing.

We have to treat opportunistic infections. The fact is that, whether we
like it or not, antiretroviral treatment is becoming inevitable, despite
the objections, and it is already applied with great success in the private
sector.

But, let us also not forget poverty alleviation. It is clear that we shall
have to mobilise a whole society in a multisectoral and co-ordinated way,
otherwise the country will be crippled.

Therefore, there is an obligation on every single parliamentarian to spread
the message every day and in every possible way. The New NP would also, on
this occasion, like to pay tribute to the numerous homes, hospices,
sanctuaries, NGOs, individuals and health workers who make it their task to
improve the lot of our fellow South Africans who are Aids sufferers or
orphans. At the end of the day, we will all be either infected or affected.
There is no getting away. [Applause.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairperson, when Finance Minister Trevor Manuel
substantially increased spending on HIV/Aids in the interim Budget, he
implied acknowledgement of the increasing devastation caused by the
disease.

According to the latest MRC report, there are about 10 000 Aids-related
deaths every two weeks. However, it has been reported that Government has
responded to this by threatening to cut the MRC's funding if it does not
toe the line on Aids. Providing antiretroviral drugs to prevent mother-to-
child HIV transmission is the least that should be done in the light of our
circumstances. By treating parents as well we would be investing in the
family, which will pay big dividends.

The use of antiretrovirals in the US led to a dramatic decline in both
deaths and the number of Aids patients admitted to hospitals. As the
pharmacy bill increases, the in-patient bill decreases, and in the end
drugs pay for themselves. Having recently visited hospitals in Mpumalanga
and having witnessed the desperation in overcrowded wards filled with HIV
patients waiting to die or committing suicide, this option looks even more
imperative. Other countries, such as Brazil, have experienced the same cost
benefit, and South Africa is in the enviable position of being able to
benefit from the lessons of these other countries.

Medical data shows that antiretroviral therapy also significantly decreases
the incidence rate of TB and may be a powerful strategy for the control of
HIV-associated TB. The ACDP calls on the Minister to be brave and to stand
up in support of making antiretrovirals available to all the people of
South Africa. As for planned parenthoods/life-skills, they are despicable,
and an affront. All I can say is: Shame on you, hon Minister.
[Interjections.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson and hon members, there is a school of thought
which says while medication and drugs are hard to come by there is
increasing recognition that public health often provides an added and
compelling justification for safeguarding human rights, despite the
respect, protection and fulfilment which they merit in their own right.

In the context of HIV/Aids, an environment in which human rights are
respected ensures that vulnerability to HIV/Aids is reduced, that those
infected with and affected by HIV/Aids live a life of dignity without
discrimination and that the personal and social impact of HIV infection is
alleviated. Government should establish organisations such as a national
Aids council in this country. Such a structure should be extended to the
provinces and other role-players such as religious bodies, business and
NGOs, who should do likewise and have a special day on which they reflect
on what they did over a period of time in relation to HIV/Aids victims.

To this end the African Methodist Episcopal Church across the globe has set
aside the second Sunday of April as a day on which they review their work
and raise awareness as a denomination. May we, as we rise to go our
constituencies, spread the simple message that the public health interests
do not conflict with human rights. [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, there is no need for an introduction to this
horrific epidemic of Aids. It has made its mark globally and it is renowned
for its rapid growth and being the cause of death, leaving many orphans,
which cause not only a social breakdown, but also affect the communities'
economic status.

Aids has made its presence felt in South Africa and is rapidly adding
victims to its list. It has been reported by Anthony Kinghorn and Malcolm
Steinberg of the HIV management service at the Aids Foundation of South
Africa that projections indicate that within three years, from 1999, almost
250 000 South Africans will die from Aids each year, rising to more than
500 000 by 2008, with an average life expectancy declining from 60 to 40
years between 1998 and 2008.

These dreadful statistics are so scary, but it is also a reality. Many
attempts have been made to depreciate this, but unsuccessfully. We and our
Government have the power to make a difference. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr A S NKOMO: Chairperson, I thank you for the opportunity to participate
in this debate about mobilising our people - all the people - in spite of
my friend over there, to participate in the 1 December World Aids Day
celebrations, precisely because it is an opportunity, I wish to tell the
hon Mike Ellis, for us to empower people with whatever knowledge there is.
The greatest cruelty that can be would be for us to hold and hoard whatever
wisdom we have and not use it to liberate and release the creative energies
and wisdom that there is in the people.

We have had the opportunity to move around the people and amongst them. And
we have learned great lessons of the creative energies and wisdom which are
there amongst the people. Witness, for instance, the statements which have
been made by a number of people who are living with Aids, because they
insist that they are not going to be objects, or guinea pigs, but that they
are going to be equal participants in the delivery of health care, not only
for themselves, but also for all of us as humankind. [Applause.]

One day books will be written, tomes and volumes, and all those will entail
this knowledge that we acquire every time when we meet with the people and
share their experiences. [Interjections.] The people tell us:
  Look, we live with Aids, but we are not going to sit down and wait to
  die. We are going to live. We are here, healthy, and we can survive every
  day, if we eat and exercise.

People have made these testimonies at various rallies and meetings in order
to encourage people so that they must know that, in fact, the diagnosis is
not a death sentence, but a challenge for people to renew and to gather
more strength to be able to survive.

We had contact with the first nations, or aboriginal people. Some people
call them Red Indians, just so that people know what we are talking about.
I do not call them Red Indians. They told us that, as communities, they
have been able to create awareness amongst themselves and, as a result of
that, they have been able to gain the greatest prize in this war and
struggle against HIV/Aids, because they were able to affect and effect a
behaviour change.

This is a lesson that we want to know, because we have spent lots of money
and energy in this country on awareness programmes. But we had a singular
experience very recently, amidst the whining and whinging. One Steven
Lewis, who is a special envoy of the United Nations, came here and
testified that, in fact, the highest levels of awareness have been
experienced here, as a result of this Government, whether one goes into a
taxi, wakes up and listens to a talk show. But, there are those who are so
blind that they will not see. These messages are there and they are bound
to be seen by all of us.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Carry on, hon member.

Dr A S NKOMO: Chairperson, quite seriously, there is this broad framework
200 and 205. There is broad agreement that this framework is correct and
has identified the real issues. There may be nuances, little differences of
emphases about the speed with which it is implemented, but there is general
agreement. And certain people have taken out of this beautiful tapestry a
little strand, maybe the most shining strand in that tapestry, and they
have concentrated on it, and that strength is the one of antiretrovirals.
And yet the people have told us that in fact there comes a time, because of
the viral role and the CD cells, that that is the time to begin with
antiretrovirals. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That was the hon member's swan
song. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

         dated 13 November 2001, to the Speaker of the National Assembly
         informing Parliament of the employment of the South African
         National Defence Force:


         Dear Madame Speaker,


         REPORT IN TERMS OF SECTION 201(3) OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
         REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, 1996 (ACT 108 OF 1996) ON THE EMPLOYMENT
         OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL DEFENCE FORCE IN TERMS OF SECTION

         INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION TOWARDS THE ORGANISATION FOR AFRICAN
         UNITY PEACE EFFORT IN THE COMORES


         This serves to inform the National Assembly that on 12 November
         2001, the Acting President authorised the employment of South
         African National Defence Force personnel to the Federal Islamic
         Republic of the Comores in fulfillment of an international
         obligation. This employment was authorised in accordance with the
         provisions of Sections 82(4)(b)(ii) of the Constitution of the
         Republic of South Africa, 1993 (Act No 200 of 1993), [which
         continues to be in force in terms of Item 24(1) of Schedule 6 to
         the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act No 108
         of 1996)], as well as Section 201(2)(c) of the said Constitution
         of 1996, as read with Section 227(1)(b) of the Constitution of

         This employment is in response to a request from the Organisation

         Advisor in the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comores. The

         efforts in the Comores and to advise the Sub-Committee on Weapons
         Collection and Reinsertion of the Youth on the weapons collection
         programme in terms of the Fomboni All Party Framework Agreement.


         The deployment will consist of one French speaking officer in the
         rank group major to colonel. The estimated period of deployment
         will be from 12 November 2001 until 25 November 2001.

       granted his petition.

    Report to be considered.

5.    Report of the Standing Committee on Private Members' Legislative
     Proposals and Special Petitions, dated 14 November 2001:


       1.   Committee activities


           (a)   The Committee met eight times, and conducted one set of
                  public hearings during 2001.


           (b)   The Committee finalised three private members' legislative
                  proposals, and is considering a fourth proposal.


           (c)   Two private members' legislative proposals have been
                  withdrawn.


           (d)   The Committee finalised its deliberations on three special
                  petitions, and is in the process of considering two
                  others.


           (e)   The Committee is planning a joint workshop to empower its
                  members to deal more efficiently and effectively with
                  their work. At this stage, the only guidelines the
                  Committee has, are the Rules of the National Assembly
                  which, for example, do not give any clear indication of
                  standards to be applied when decisions need to be made
                  regarding special petitions. The Committee is at present
                  pursuing all avenues to ensure that its members receive
                  optimal training and guidance in this respect, also from
                  foreign parliaments.


         2. Administrative arrangements


              (a) Providing the members with copies of documents remains a
                  problem. The few copying machines at the Committee
                  Section are in constant use, and often out of order. The
                  so-called "big copying machine" is not on the
                  parliamentary premises anymore, but at 18 St Johns
                  Street. Arrangements have been made to copy documents on
                  other machines in Parliament, such as at the library, but
                  those machines do not have the capacity to service the
                  Committee's needs effectively. Alternative copying
                  arrangements are vague, cumbersome and impractical.


              (b) Another major problem this Committee has experienced over
                  the past few years, is the high turnover of support staff
                  in the Committee Section. This affects the Committee's
                  ability to keep a good record of its documents, and makes
                  it difficult to track Committee activities over a period
                  of time.


              (c) The Committee therefore recommends that in future
                  Committee Chairpersons be consulted when rotation of
                  staff is to be considered, to ensure the most effective
                  support to parliamentary committees.


         3. Parliamentary programme


              (a) Several of the members of the Committee serve in a number
                  of parliamentary committees, with the result that
                  meetings have to be postponed to ensure that meetings are
                  quorate. Also, the Committee has found itself in a
                  position where it has made arrangements for a meeting,
                  only to find that the parliamentary programme has been
                  amended and the Committee is not able to meet at its pre-
                  arranged time. This results in meetings being cancelled,
                  sometimes at the last minute, resulting in other
                  administrative difficulties, such as informing members of
                  changes in arrangements and finding a suitable venue for
                  meetings at a later date and time, especially as there
                  are so few committee rooms in Parliament.


              (b) Whereas the Committee realises that finding a solution to
                  this vexing problem is no easy matter, it requests the
                  Programme Committee to inform Chairpersons and Committee
                  Secretaries as soon as possible when programme changes
                  will take place, in order to minimise the effect of such
                  changes in the programme, and to enable the support staff
                  to make suitable alternative arrangements.

Report to be considered.

6.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional
    Development on Designation of Ireland , dated 17 May 2001:


       The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development,
       having considered the request for approval by Parliament of the
       Designation of Ireland in terms of the Extradition Act, 1962 (Act No.
       67 of 1962), referred to it, recommends that the House, in terms of
       section 2(3)(a) of the Act, approve the said designation, subject to
       the following conditions:


       1.   No person surrendered by Ireland shall, in the Republic of South
           Africa -


           (a)   be proceeded against, sentenced or detained with a view to
                  the carrying out of a sentence or detention order, or
                  otherwise restricted in his or her personal freedom, for
                  any offence committed prior to his or her surrender other
                  than the offence in respect of which his or her
                  extradition was sought or an offence of which he or she
                  may lawfully be convicted on a charge of the offence in
                  respect of which extradition was sought, except -


                  (i)  with the consent of Ireland; or


                  (ii) where the person, having had an opportunity of
                         leaving the Republic of South Africa, has not done
                         so within 45 days of final discharge in respect of
                         the offence for which the person was surrendered by
                         Ireland or, having left the Republic of South
                         Africa after being so surrendered, has returned to
                         the Republic of South Africa;


           (b)   where the description of the offence charged is altered in
                  the course of proceedings, be proceeded against or
                  sentenced in the Republic of South Africa in respect of
                  that offence, except so far as the offence under the new
                  description is shown by its constituent elements to be an
                  offence which would allow extradition from Ireland.


         2. A person surrendered by Ireland shall not be surrendered by the
              Republic of South Africa to another country for an offence
              committed before the surrender of the person by Ireland,
              except -


              (a) with the consent of Ireland; or


              (b) where the person, having had an opportunity of leaving the
                  Republic of South Africa, has not done so within 45 days
                  of final discharge in respect of the offence for which
                  the person was surrendered by Ireland or, having left the
                  Republic of South Africa after being so surrendered, has
                  returned to the Republic of South Africa.


     Report to be considered.

7.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture and Land Affairs on
    Statutory Measures in Wine Industry, dated 6 November 2001:


         The Portfolio Committee on Agriculture and Land Affairs, having
         considered the application by the National Agricultural Marketing
         Council for the implementation of proposed statutory measures in
         the wine industry, reports, in terms of section 15 of the
         Marketing of Agricultural Products Act, 1996, that it has approved
         the recommendation of the Council.


         The Committee further recommends that surplus funds be utilised at
         the Minister's discretion within the industry in which they were
         collected.

8.    Thirteenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, dated
     8 November 2001:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered certain
     papers submitted to it and having heard evidence from Ms S Gillwald,
     Deputy Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development, Mr S
     Patterson, Audit Committee, Mr V P Pikoli, Director-General: Justice
     and Constitutional Development, and Mr A Mackenzie, Chief Financial
     Officer: Justice, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         The Committee has held a hearing with the Department of Justice in
         order to fulfil its obligation in accordance with its Tenth Report
         for 2000, to set up a system of monitoring progress made by the
         Department in improving financial management.


         In that Tenth Report, the Committee expressed its view that if
         there was no significant improvement in the management of public
         finances of the Department of Justice, the Committee would request
         the National Treasury to intervene, in terms of the Public Finance
         Management Act, in the financial management of the Department.


         The Committee notes with guarded optimism the appointment of the
         new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in the Department, as well as
         the organisational restructuring and the establishment of the new
         Board of Justice. The Department appears to focus on fixing the
         crisis in financial management that has been plaguing it. While
         the Committee welcomes these new developments, it remains
         concerned that the Department still faces a number of obstacles in
         overcoming challenges to improve and consolidate improvements in
         systems of sound financial management that remain.


         The Committee further notes that the new changes at the
         Department, particularly the Performance Enhancement Programme
         (PEP), appear to have been replaced, in large part, by the
         Financial Management Improvement Plan (FMIP), which previously had
         been submitted by the Department for the Committee's attention.


         The Committee has received the Auditor-General's Report on the
         2000-01 accounts of the Department, and will hold further hearings
         with the Department, as and when required.


     B.     Financial Management - new CFO and change management


         On previous occasions the Committee has expressed its concern at
         the need for a committed CFO to lead the Department out of its
         financial management malaise. The Committee notes the secondment
         to the Department of the current CFO, that this is an appointment
         for a year and that the Department will have to take steps to
         ensure that a new CFO is in place on a more permanent basis and
         that a substantial amount of skills transfer will be required from
         the current CFO to the new CFO.


         The Committee is therefore concerned at the sustainability of the
         significant macro-organisational changes initiated by the new CFO
         and the overall sustainability of the new approach, pending either
         the extension of the CFO's tenure - which would imply a new
         arrangement between the government and Business Against Crime - or
         the appointment of a new permanent CFO.


         In this regard, the Committee has noted with concern the Director-
         General's comments that the search for a CFO, prior to appointment
         of the incumbent CFO, proved difficult and that this may again be
         the case in future. The Committee firmly believes that in order
         for the turnaround in the Department to be viable and sustainable,
         a strong CFO will be needed, with the complete support of the
         Board of Justice, to effect the changes proposed.


         The Committee recommends that it be informed of succession
         planning in respect of the CFO. The Committee has noted the grave
         concerns expressed by the Audit Committee about the incumbent
         CFO's short tenure and the need to ensure that the new CFO is
         sufficiently skilled and competent to carry the restructuring
         forward. The Committee further requires a more comprehensive
         briefing on the new structure of the Business Units in the
         Department as well as the Board of Justice, in the event that this
         might affect the accountability arrangements of the Department
         with regard to the Committee.


         The Committee is further concerned at delays in skills training to
         improve financial management skills in the Department. In terms of
         the previous FMIP, skills training was due to commence in February
         2001. Due to the comprehensive skills audit initiated by the new
         CFO, the training deadlines initially envisaged in the FMIP have
         been pushed back.


         While the Committee commends the approach of a comprehensive
         skills audit, it remains concerned that the training deadlines
         have not been met in a Department in which the upgrading of
         financial management skills is fundamental to addressing its
         financial management crisis.


     C.     Decentralisation


         The Committee has expressed concern at the impact of the policy
         decision on decentralisation and its role in exacerbating the
         difficulties and problems in financial management.


         The Committee has noted the statements by the Deputy Minister for
         Justice that there is a clear policy decision that the
         decentralised Regional Offices must be phased out. The Committee
         notes statements by the Deputy Minister for Justice and
         Constitutional Development that the eventual goal is for each
         office to be a cost centre in the new financial management plan of
         the Department. It is clear that the "exit strategy" appears to
         entail an incremental approach, with pilot projects being launched
         in the Eastern Cape Regional Office in East London.


         As the decentralisation question is fundamental to changing the
         public finance management fortunes of the Department, the
         Committee looks forward to receiving details of how the policy
         decision on decentralisation will find expression in the "exit
         strategy", which was submitted to the Board of Justice. The
         Committee will take this "exit strategy" into consideration in
         preparation for its next engagement with the Department, as the
         area of decentralisation remains a key concern to the Committee.


         The Committee welcomes the Deputy Minister's commitment to brief
         the Committee on deadlines, time-frames and the detail of the
         decentralisation "exit strategy", and request that the relevant
         information be submitted as soon as possible.


         The Committee requires further detail on the manner in which the
         Department envisages centralising the Budget and then devolving
         responsibilities to the respective "cost centres" mentioned by the
         Deputy Minister.


     D.     Information furnished to Committee


         In its Tenth Report, the Committee called for the Department of
         Justice to, firstly, submit monthly reports on the FMIP adopted by
         the Department and, secondly, quarterly reports to be submitted by
         the Audit Committee. The Committee called for these regular
         reporting lines because of the severe problems in the Department
         and the need to have a more active oversight role in the context
         of the difficulties within the Department.


         It is of great concern to the Committee that the Department failed
         to meet these reporting obligations requested by Parliament. The
         Committee raised these concerns with both the CFO and the Director-
         General, and the Committee will continue to require substantive
         quarterly reports from the Department, in the light of the
         substantive organisational change at the Department. In addition,
         the Committee will be receiving copies of the monthly progress
         reports with the implementation of the Departments' PEP, submitted
         by the CFO to the Board of Justice. The Committee has received the
         monthly report for June, submitted to the Board of Justice. The
         information will be used as part of the preparation for the
         upcoming hearing. The Committee also notes the willingness of the
         CFO to brief members of the Committee on a more regular basis.


     E.     Audit Committee
         The Committee notes comments by the Deputy Minister and the
         Director-General that an Audit Committee is being set up that will
         provide appropriate direction to the Internal Audit Unit.


     F.     Deposit Account


         The Committee remains concerned about the negative situation
         surrounding the Deposit Account. The Committee has noted that
         financial statements for the 1994-95, 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98
         financial years were due to be produced by the end of May. It is
         of concern to the Committee that these statements may be
         unauditable. A report by the Auditor-General in this regard has
         been tabled recently [RP 100-2001], and will be dealt with during
         the upcoming hearing.


     G.     Unauthorised expenditure, 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000


         The Committee heard and considered evidence on the following
         instances of unauthorised expenditure reported on in the reports
         of the Auditor-General for the 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000
         financial years:


         1. 1997-98 financial year - expenditure totalling R157 415 769,28
              (par 2.2.1, p 5)


              (a) Over-expenditure on voted funds relating to personal
                  expenditure amounting to R24 754 954,15 was mainly due to
                  inadequate financial control and the lack of reliable
                  management information. Consequently, the amount was
                  unauthorised in terms of section 33(1)(b) of the
                  Exchequer Act, 1975 (Act No. 66 of 1975), applicable at
                  the time.


                  The Committee has taken note that since 1 April 2001,
                  monthly management reports are being produced and that in
                  future the Department should foresee instances of likely
                  excess expenditure, provided that the monthly reports are
                  reliable and the information is used regularly for
                  corrective steps.
                  In view of the above, the Committee recommends that the
                  amount be authorised. However, the Committee wishes to
                  point out to the Director-General that in terms of the
                  regime established by the PFMA since April 2000, excess
                  spending on voted funds is regarded as financial
                  misconduct.


              (b) A column-2 item relating to the Legal Aid Board amounting
                  to R102 633 298,84 exceeded the amount voted due to
                  misallocation of expenditure. Authority of the Minister
                  of Finance was not obtained as prescribed by section
                  7(1)(b)(ii) of the Exchequer Act. However, there was no
                  loss to the State.


                  The Committee recommends that the amount be authorised,
                  but will in future not accept similar instances of poor
                  control.


              (c) Virement approval by the accounting officer was not given
                  for the utilisation of savings to defray excess
                  expenditure totalling R29 568 550,43, which resulted in
                  unauthorised expenditure in terms section 33(1)(b) of the
                  Exchequer Act. Included in the amount is an amount of
                  R166 645,80, which constitutes a saving on a column-2
                  item, which may only have been used for defraying the
                  expenditure with the specific approval of the Minister of
                  Finance in terms of section 6(2) of the Exchequer Act.


                  Strict adherence to the legal requirements for virement
                  approval will be expected in future. Such consideration
                  should also always be supported with proper and timely
                  management information. As the State did not suffer any
                  losses, the Committee recommends that the amount be
                  authorised by Parliament.


              (d) Non-compliance with State Tender Board directives gave
                  rise to an amount of R458 965,86 being unauthorised. The
                  expenditure was related to the appointment of consultants
                  for employment equity workshops and for the compilation
                  of business plans relating to the transformation of the
                  administration of justice project. The State Tender Board
                  did not grant ex post facto approval for the non-
                  compliance.


                  As the Committee has been informed that the Department
                  had certified that the services rendered were to its
                  satisfaction and benefitted the State, it recommends that
                  the amount in question be authorised by Parliament.


         2. 1998-99 financial year - expenditure totalling R79 074 324,32
              (par 2.2.1, p 5)


              (a) During the 1998-99 financial year, excess spending on
                  voted funds gave rise to unauthorised expenditure of
                  R47 046 814,09 in terms of section 33(1)(b) of the
                  Exchequer Act.


                  As in the case of paragraph 1 above, the excess seems to
                  be the result of inadequate financial control and a lack
                  of complete management information necessary to take
                  timely corrective action in curbing over-expenditure.
                  However, in view of the improved position with regard to
                  regular management information and the fact that, with
                  effect from the 2000-01 financial year, over-expenditure
                  is regarded as financial misconduct, the Committee
                  recommends that the amount in question be authorised by
                  Parliament.


              (b) Virement approval for utilising savings amounting to
                  R21 162 076,18 to defray excess expenditure was not given
                  by the Accounting Officer, as required by section 6(1) of
                  the Exchequer Act, with the result that the amount is
                  unauthorised. This reflects poor financial management
                  discipline. However, as the State did not suffer any
                  loss, it is recommended that the amount be authorised by
                  Parliament.


              (c) Expenditure of R10 654 131,64 relating to Legal Aid prior
                  to 17 October 1997 was incorrectly charged to the
                  Department and is therefore unauthorised in terms of
                  section 33(1)(a) of the Exchequer Act. Given the
                  precarious financial position of the Legal Aid Board at
                  the time and since then, the Committee is of the opinion
                  that claiming the amount in question from the Legal Aid
                  Board at this stage would not be supportive of the
                  rendering of legal aid envisaged by the Constitution.


                  The Committee therefore recommends that the amount in
                  question be authorised.


              (d) An ex gratia payment of R67 450,74 was made without
                  obtaining Treasury approval, resulting in unauthorised
                  expenditure in terms of section 33(1)(c) of the Exchequer
                  Act. The payment relates to overtime remuneration to a
                  senior magistrate acting as a regional representative for
                  KwaZulu-Natal for the period October 1996 to July 1997.
                  As ex gratia payments are not uncommon, the overtime
                  worked was in the interest of the Department and the
                  payment was made on recommendation of the State Attorney,
                  the Committee recommends that the amount in question be
                  authorised by Parliament.


              (e) An instance of non-compliance with State Tender Board
                  directives relating to an amount of R143 851,85 was
                  listed in the General Report of the Auditor-General for
                  the year in question as expenditure that "is not material
                  or has not resulted in a loss to the State, or the
                  question of mala fides did not arise, or the expenditure
                  is only unauthorised due to a technical contravention of
                  the regulations".


                  The Committee therefore recommends authorisation of the
                  amount in question.


              (f) Backlogs in capturing batches of expenditure vouchers: The
                  Committee is very concerned about the backlog that has
                  existed for a number of years with respect to the
                  capturing of expenditure vouchers. In the 1998-99
                  financial year, this possibly gave rise to departmental
                  expenditure for the year being understated by
                  approximately R91,5 million. The Committee has been
                  informed that a dedicated task team has been constituted
                  to eliminate the backlog, but that the project may only
                  be fully completed in 2002.


                  The Committee wishes to give notice that it will await
                  the proper completion of the project, but that as from
                  the 2002-03 financial years, no backlogs will be
                  tolerated.


         3. 1999-2000 financial year


              A cost overrun of R1 176 738 on a contract of R2 172 726
              approved by the State Tender Board, relating to information
              technology services for Y2K preparation, was unauthorised.
              No mala fides was involved and the Department benefitted from
              the service. Although the State Tender Board should have been
              approached for extension, the State did not suffer any loss.
              The Committee therefore recommends that the amount in question
              be authorised by Parliament.


              With respect to the remainder of the 1999-2000 unauthorised
              expenditure, the Committee has requested certain explanations
              from the Director-General of the Department.


         Postscript


         The Committee wishes to point out, however, that in recommending
         the approval of the above instances of unauthorised expenditure,
         it does not condone any form of non-compliance with applicable
         law, nor wasteful or fruitless expenditure. The Committee is
         cognisant of the efforts of the Accounting Officer, assisted by
         the acting CFO during this year, to instill financial management
         discipline within the Department. These efforts are strongly
         supported by the Committee. However, at the same time the
         Accounting Officer's future achievements in this regard will be
         measured against the highest standards of public accountability
         and stewardship.

9.    Fourteenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, dated
     8 November 2001:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having heard and considered
     evidence on the Report of the Auditor-General on the Financial
     Statements of Vote 13 - Foreign Affairs for the year ended 31 March
     2000 [RP 122-2000], referred to it, reports as follows:


     Unauthorised expenditure (Par 2.2.1, page 2)


     1.     Expenditure in excess of vote


         The total provision under the vote for the 1999-2000 financial
         year was exceeded by R35 896 255,87. The Department of Foreign
         Affairs explained that the excess was due to severe exchange rate
         losses against all major international currencies.


         The Committee noted the Accounting Officer's commitment to
         containing expenditure by, inter alia, having taken the following
         steps:


         (a)     Placing a moratorium on the filling of vacant posts not
              regarded as critical, or delaying the filling of such
              vacancies.


         (b)     Not adjusting foreign allowances in line with the
              increased cost of living indices of a number of countries
              abroad.


         (c)     Deferring the replacement and maintenance of capital items
              not already committed or in progress.


         The Committee further noted that the impact of exchange rate
         movements is an exogenous factor, which the Department cannot
         predict or control. The fluctuations, however, have severely
         impacted on the budget of the Department, as more than 75 per cent
         of that budget is spent in foreign currencies. It was also noted
         that the Department has not been granted approval to purchase
         foreign currency as a contingency against fluctuations in the
         currency market, and the Committee recommends that the situation
         again be raised with the Treasury. (For example, when the Treasury
         granted an allocation for the 2000-01 financial year, the budget
         rate of exchange was R7,52 to US$1,00.)


         In view of the inevitability of the excess expenditure and the
         steps taken by the Accounting Officer to prevent such future
         excess expenditure, the Committee recommends that the amount in
         question be authorised by Parliament.


     2.     Amalgamation of foreign affairs departments of former TBVC
         countries with national department


         The Department paid an amount totalling R6 777 768,78, without
         supporting documentation, to certain provinces for personnel
         expenditure.


         In the Committee's Thirteenth Report for 2000, it was suggested
         that the Department should establish an audit trail to ensure that
         the amount has been spent properly. As this was not possible, the
         amount was regarded as unauthorised and was brought to account.


         The Committee has been informed that a firm of consultants had
         tried to establish whether documents were available to
         substantiate the expenditure on personnel costs. They could not
         identify an audit trail owing to a lack of supporting
         documentation. The Committee, recognising the poor state of record-
         keeping by the former TBVC states, is firmly of the view that it
         will be a futile exercise to spend money to reconstruct a
         documentary history of the expenditure involved. In the light of
         the improved financial management of the Department, the Committee
         recommends that the expenditure in question be authorised by
         Parliament.

10.   Report of the Portfolio Committee on Transport on the Road Accident
     Fund Board, dated 24 October 2001:


     The Portfolio Committee on Transport, having conducted a hearing with
     the Road Accident Fund Board, reports as follows:


     1.     The Committee conducted an extensive hearing with the Board of
         the Road Accident Fund on 10 October 2001. The Minister of
         Transport, in accordance with the Road Accident Fund Act,
         appointed the Board on 1 June 2000. The Committee sought to
         establish what progress has since been made by the Board in
         identifying problems within the Fund, and with introducing
         corrective measures.


     2.     In its report to the Committee, the Board indicated that shortly
         after its inauguration, the Board had initiated a forensic audit
         by external consultants. The independent audit identified a number
         of serious problems, including:


         (a)     A lack of capacity at senior management level. The Fund
              had been without a substantive Chief Executive Officer since
              September 1998, and some critical senior positions were either
              vacant or non-existent.
         (b)     Very high levels of staff turnover.


         (c)     Poor systems, including outdated and unwieldy information
              processing, and the conflation of different functions in the
              handling of claims.


              These poor systems also created conditions in which fraud
              could more easily occur, and the audit indicated several areas
              in which there was strong circumstantial evidence suggesting
              fraud and the existence of syndicates within the Fund.


     3.     In their report, and in responses to questions from the
         Committee, Board members indicated that active steps were being
         taken to remedy these and other problems. Such steps included:


         (a)     The appointment of a CEO, and the filling and/or creation
              of senior management positions.


         (b)     The progressive re-engineering of claims administration
              and more effective use of information technology.
         (c)     Close co-operation with the National Directorate of Public
              Prosecutions and its agencies to deal with fraud. Following
              the audit, there have been eight dismissals, and 22 staff
              members are under investigation.


     4.     The Committee commended the Board for its activism, and for the
         remedial steps it had undertaken. However, the Committee expressed
         concern that interim arrangements, like members of the Board being
         directly involved with the management of the Fund, not be seen as
         permanent. It is desirable that the functions of the Board and the
         management of the Fund should not be conflated. The Committee also
         expressed disappointment that the independent audit had not been
         made available to the Road Accident Fund Commission and to
         Parliament, as it could greatly assist the Committee in its
         oversight function.


     5.     The Committee also raised questions about allegations made in
         the public domain about possible conflicts of interest in respect
         of some members of the Board. Board members responded that they
         had never hidden the nature of their private business activities;
         indeed, these issues were expressly raised during the selection
         interviews. They pointed out that the Road Accident Fund Act
         requires certain skills to be represented on the Board, and that
         some of these skills were only to be found among professionals
         doing active work, either for the Fund or for claimants in respect
         of the Fund. Board members further insisted that Board
         deliberations could have no direct bearing on any of their private
         business activities. The Committee noted these explanations, and
         indicated that ongoing engagement on this matter was required.


     6.     Board and Committee members alike agreed that many of the above
         problems could only be fully addressed by considering fairly
         substantial changes to the character of the Fund itself. These
         changes would require legislative amendments. The Committee was
         encouraged that the Board had begun to discuss a number of
         legislative amendments, and although the Board's own discussions
         are not fully complete, it is proposing that the following areas
         are among those that could be considered with a view to amendment:


         (a)     To remove the current limitation to R25 000 of the
              liability of the Fund in respect of the claims of all
              passengers in order to give the same unlimited cover enjoyed
              by other claimants also to this category of claimant.


         (b)     To abolish the procedural right of medical suppliers to
              claim directly from the Fund.


         (c)     To limit the liability of the Fund in respect of claims of
              non-residents of the Republic to a reasonable amount to be
              determined.


         (d)     To authorise the Fund to provide managed treatment plans,
              under an outreach programme, to injured persons with medical
              needs extending into the future.


         (e)     To exclude the application of the Assessment of Damages
              Act, 1969, which prevents the deduction of insurance and
              pension monies when assessing compensation for loss of
              support.


         (f)     To render deductible all collateral benefits in the case
              of a claim for compensation due to bodily injury.


         (g)     To ensure better provision in respect of undertakings to
              pay future loss of income and of support by way of
              instalments, instead of in the form of a predetermined cash
              lump-sum.


         (h)     To pay substantial general damages for ongoing pain and
              suffering by way of instalments, rather than by way of a cash
              lump-sum.


         (i)     To exclude compensation for emotional shock (allegedly)
              induced when a person, not actually involved in an accident,
              witnesses or hears of the injury or death of another person in
              an accident.


         (j)     To provide for mediation/arbitration as the primary
              dispute resolution mechanism for claims against the Fund.


         (k)     To provide for compensation on a no-fault basis in respect
              of the stabilisation of trauma victims during a "golden hour"
              period after an accident.


         (l)     To bring the costs of medical treatment of road accident
              victims in line with a dedicated Road Accident Fund tariff.


         (m)     To extend the fuel levy to natural gas and green/bio-
              diesel used as fuel in motor vehicles.


     7.     The Committee is of the view that such legislative amendments
         would make a major contribution to improving the financial
         viability of the Fund, to ensure that a much greater proportion of
         the awards find its way to actual claimants and to remove many of
         the features of the Fund that have exposed it to the dangers of
         abuse and fraud. The Committee notes the ongoing work of the Road
         Accident Fund Commission, and further notes that the Commission's
         report is now only scheduled for public release in July 2002. The
         Committee believes that interim legislative amendments are
         urgently needed, and that such amendments would not prejudice
         further restructuring of the Fund once the Commission has
         reported. Indeed, based on our interim hearings with the
         Commission, we are convinced that the amendments proposed by the
         Board are substantially congruent with the broad strategic
         direction that the Commission's report will recommend.


     8.     The Committee believes there is one other legislative amendment
         that might be considered. While the final appointment of the Board
         should still be the prerogative of the Minister, the relevant
         parliamentary committees should make provision for public hearings
         for the purposes of short-listing. Such hearings could help to
         build public confidence where there are concerns about conflicts
         of interest or representativity.


     9.     The Committee therefore recommends that:
         (a)     For the purposes of enhancing our public oversight role,
              the Road Accident Fund Board make available to Parliament the
              Independent Forensic Audit of the Fund that the Board had
              commissioned.


         (b)     The Minister of Transport give urgent attention to the
              possibility of introducing to Parliament early next year
              legislative amendments to the Road Accident Fund Act in the
              areas noted in paragraphs 7 and 8 above.
