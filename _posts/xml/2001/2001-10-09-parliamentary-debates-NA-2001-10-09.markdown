                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that President Thabo Mbeki will deliver a commemorative lecture
       in remembrance of Comrade Z K Matthews;
  (2) believes that Comrade Z K Matthews played an important  role  in  the
       struggle for the total liberation of the people of South Africa;


  (3) acknowledges the role and contribution of Comrade Z K Matthews in the
       struggle for liberation; and


  (4) reiterates  our  commitment  to  work  tirelessly  for  a  nonracial,
       nonsexist and democratic South Africa.

[Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay the statement by the hon Mr Tony Yengeni  in  which
       he criticised the Scorpions because they were ``too  white''  and  in
       which Mr Yengeni implied that black people would have a different and
       lower standard in respect of his alleged criminal activities, and  he
       would therefore not have been charged criminally; and
  (2) therefore resolves to censure the hon Mr Yengeni for the gross insult
       which he has paid to all black South Africans.

[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon Mr Gibson, I need to clarify something.  Do  you  in
fact want to move a motion of substance on another member?  It  is  not  the
content that is my concern.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I am giving notice of an intention  to  move
a motion which censures Mr Yengeni, because of the statement he made,  which
I aver is a racist statement and an insult to black South Africans.

The SPEAKER: Order! I will look into that.

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the Constitutional Court  judgment  on  the  admission  age  to
       independent schools;


  (2) believes -


       (a)  that the principles of choice and recognition of mental  age  is
           very important; and


       (b)  that discrimination in terms of  age  in  the  school  admission
           policy will no longer be the only determinant, but  that  mental
           age will also be considered in the sum total composing  a  human
           being; and


  (3) hopes  that  a  sense  of  urgency  in  treating  this  matter  as  a
       qualitative rather than a quantitative aspect in  so  far  as  public
       school admissions are concerned, will prevail.

Mrs Z A KOTA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes with profound sadness and sorrow the tragic  death  of  Comrade
       Chris Gutuza last Sunday;


  (2) believes that Comrade Chris played an important role -


       (a)  through his work at Media Training  and  Development  Trust,  in
           nurturing talent of  potential  journalists  from  disadvantaged
           backgrounds, and was a firm believer in the freedom of the press
           and the right to information as a human right; and


       (b)  in ensuring that communities were informed  about  realities  of
           life under apartheid when he was working for South newspaper;


  (3) expresses our sincere condolences to his wife,  Ayesha  Ishmael,  his
       two daughters, his friends and relatives; and


  (4) joins them in mourning the untimely departure of this patriot.

[Applause.]

Mr J J DOWRY: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that a growing number of  Ministers  use  Question
       Time as a platform to  make  personal  and  racist  remarks  such  as
       referring to black opposition MPs as ``Mr White'';


  (2) questions the  commitment  of  Ministers  and  any  other  member  of
       Parliament guilty of making racist  insults  to  the  eradication  of
       racism in South Africa;


  (3) calls on the majority party to condemn  the  remarks  made  by  these
       Ministers; and


  (4) urges all MPs to refrain from such disgraceful behaviour, because not
       only is it a shame that they have to be reprimanded for such actions,
       but it is also an embarrassment for Parliament.

[Applause.]

Mr C T FROLICK: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the Appeal Court judgment clearing the  way  for  some  40  000
       pensioners  to  bring  a  class  action  against  the  Eastern   Cape
       government;


  (2) further notes that this is the first time that such an action will be
       allowed in South Africa;


  (3) also notes the strongly worded Appeal Court judgment that slammed the
       Eastern Cape government for attempting to block the pensioners' right
       to bring the action, and that the Government had acted as  though  it
       was ``at war with its citizens'';


  (4) calls on the Government to  protect  the  poor  and  most  vulnerable
       sectors of our community; and


  (5) calls on the people of the Eastern  Cape  to  reject  the  provincial
       government's posturing as caring, while in reality practising  social
       injustice.

Mrs J CHALMERS: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the ANC-led  Government  has  successfully  contained  the
       spread of malaria in KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) further notes that the South African  Government  received  a  United
       Nations award of excellence for the best malaria control programme in
       the world;


  (3)  believes  that  the  successful  fight  against   malaria   reflects
       Government's commitment to providing health care that meets the needs
       of our people;


  (4) commends the ANC-led Government for having successfully contained the
       spread of malaria; and


  (5) acknowledges the commitment of the ANC-led  Government  to  directing
       state funds to fighting  poverty-related  diseases  such  as  TB  and
       cholera.

[Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with disapproval the failure of the Department of  Education  to
           make  copies  of  the  controversial  Curriculum   2005   freely
           available for public comment and input;


       (b)  with shock that many libraries, colleges and  universities  have
           not even heard of the national Curriculum 2005 and fewer than  a
           handful have access to it;


       (c)  with disapproval the  state's  attempt  to  bypass  parents  and
           introduce a curriculum that  undermines  the  moral  values  and
           religious beliefs of Christian parents; and


       (d)  with disgust the diabolical plan of some in  the  department  to
           indoctrinate children and deny parents the right to choose  what
           type of education their children should receive; and


  (2) therefore calls on the Minister of Education to be transparent and to
       -


       (a)  extend the deadline for inputs to the end of the year, so as  to
           give parents reasonable time to study the document;


       (b)  ensure that at least every school's governing body has a copy of
           the controversial Curriculum 2005;


       (c)  respect the right of every parent to make  decisions  about  the
           education of their children; and
       (d)  inform the public, and in particular this House, who decided  on
           the content of the curriculum and why there has been so  little,
           if any, input from parents and community members.

[Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Mev die Speaker, ek  gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis kennis neem dat -


  (1) die  Vryheidsfront  vroeër  vanjaar  'n  klag  by  die  Persombudsman
       ingedien het teen die Mail & Guardian na aanleiding  van  'n  Zebulon
       Dread-artikel oor die  Klein  Karoo  Kunstefees  te  Oudtshoorn,  wat
       aanstoot aan baie Afrikaners  gegee  het  en  wat  deur  die  koerant
       geplaas is;


  (2) die klagte deur die VF suksesvol was  en  dat  daar  in  die  nuutste
       uitgawe van die Mail & Guardian 'n verskoning aan Afrikaners oor  die
       artikel deur die redakteur geplaas is, tesame  met  'n  opvolgartikel
       deur die VF;
  (3) die VF hierdie verskoning van die Mail & Guardian teenoor  Afrikaners
       aanvaar en dit verwelkom;


  (4) persvryheid van groot belang is vir die VF en dat ons alles  moontlik
       sal doen om dit te beskerm, maar dat die artikel  van  Zebulon  Dread
       alle grense van fatsoenlikheid oorskry het - daarom die klagte; en


  (5) die VF daarom dankbaar is dat die media se  eie  dissiplinêre  proses
       gewerk het, en dit dus moontlik was om die probleem op  hierdie  wyse
       bevredigend deur die Persombudsman te kon oplos.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) earlier this year the FF lodged a complaint with the Press  Ombudsman
       against the Mail & Guardian, arising from  a  Zebulon  Dread  article
       about the Klein Karoo Kunstefees at Oudtshoorn, which  offended  many
       Afrikaners and which was published by the newspaper;
  (2) the complaint by the  FF  was  successful  and  that  an  apology  to
       Afrikaners for the article has been printed in the latest edition  of
       the Mail & Guardian by its editor, along with a follow-up article  by
       the FF;


  (3) the FF accepts and welcomes this apology to Afrikaners by the Mail  &
       Guardian;


  (4) freedom of the press is of great importance to the  FF  and  that  we
       will do all that is possible to defend it, but that  the  article  by
       Zebulon Dread exceeded all limits of decency - hence  the  complaint;
       and


  (5) the FF is  therefore  grateful  that  the  media's  own  disciplinary
       process has worked, and that it was therefore possible for the  Press
       Ombudsman to solve the problem satisfactorily in this way.]

Mr F BHENGU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that 71 students will leave South Africa to study  medicine  in
       Cuba;


  (2) further notes that the people and the government of  Cuba  played  an
       important role in the struggle against minority rule in  the  country
       and region, and assisted the liberation  movement  in  defending  the
       gains of the revolution in Angola;


  (3) believes that the people and the government of Cuba remain  committed
       to the progressive values of international  solidarity,  freedom  and
       equality; and


  (4) acknowledges the commitment  of  the  Cuban  people  to  support  our
       struggle to create a better life for all our people.

[Applause.]

Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay that the ANC, specifically the  Minister  of  Sport
       and Recreation, refers to coloured South  Africans  as  ``coconuts'',
       thereby suggesting that we are not ``black''  enough  to  be  treated
       with respect;


  (2) questions the commitment of the ANC to a  country  that  is  free  of
       racism when its Ministers resort so frequently to racist labelling in
       this House;


  (3) demands that the ANC treat  all  South  Africans  equally,  and  give
       recognition to the contributions of all  our  people  to  building  a
       united future; and


  (4) calls on the ANC to apologise unreservedly to coloured South Africans
       for this insult.

[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, there is  an  outstanding  ruling  on  that
matter. I will ensure that  the  relevant  presiding  officer  will  give  a
ruling very quickly.

Mrs I MARS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that the function of allocating the proceeds from  the  National
           Lottery is located within the national Department of  Trade  and
           Industry; and


       (b)  that welfare and  other  charitable  organisations  fall  mainly
           under the national Department of Social Development; and


  (2) calls on the Government to reallocate the  function  of  distributing
       the proceeds of the National Lottery to the  national  Department  of
       Social Development.

Mr M R BALOYI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that Newlands Stadium hosted the Coca-Cola double-header soccer
       match last weekend;


  (2) further notes that this match was successful and free of incidents of
       crime and hooliganism;


  (3) believes that events  of  this  nature  enhance  nation-building  and
       present  scarce  opportunities  for  small  traders  and  hawkers  to
       generate much-needed income; and


  (4) calls on the DA city council and other  sensitive-minded  authorities
       to accept and direct that soccer be played at  the  Newlands  Stadium
       for future events.

[Applause.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that
on the next sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the mayor of the Nelson Mandela  Metropole,   Nceba  Faku,

       personal use to the tune of R87 000;


  (2) further notes that the mayor allegedly used more than R27 000 of this
       fund to pay his traffic fines and tuition fees for relatives, as well
       as other amounts for driving lessons, holiday expenses, etc; and


  (3) calls on the provincial auditor to investigate these allegations  and
       to ensure that -


       (a)  a full disclosure is made of all moneys spent  from  this  fund;
           and


       (b)  all moneys used are paid back  into  the  Mayor's  Discretionary
           Fund.

[Applause.]

  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the disarray in the Department  of  Education  relating  to  the
           Minister's strange priorities; and


       (b)  that an alarming quarter of the Grade  7  pupils  sampled  in  a
           school census pilot study are 15 years  or  older,  which  means
           that a quarter of them have already failed at least one year  of
           primary schooling;

Mr S PHOHLELA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Office of the Executive Mayor in Mogale  Local  Municipality

       (b)  a database with 254 names has been compiled and will be followed

  (3) welcomes this new initiative; and


  (4) calls on other unicity councils to emulate this important example.

[Applause.]

            TERRORIST ATTACKS ON PARLIAMENTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) noting with shock the spate of  terrorist  attacks  on  a  number  of
       parliaments throughout the world, namely -


       (a)  the attack on the Legislative Assembly of Jammu and  Kashmir  in
           Srinagar in India resulting in 31 deaths; and
       (b)  the attack on the Zug Cantonal Assembly in Switzerland in  which
           14 parliamentarians died;


  (2) believes  that  such  despicable  attempts  to  undermine  democratic
       governance will ultimately prove fruitless  as  countries  throughout
       the  world  unite  to  defend  themselves  against  the  scourge   of
       terrorism;


  (3) condemns these attacks and offers its sympathy to those  nations  who
       have been so attacked; and


  (4) sends its condolences to the bereaved  and  wishes  those  injured  a
       speedy recovery.

Agreed to.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Census Week starts tomorrow, 10 October 2001;


  (2) believes that the census process  is  critical  for  determining  the
       needs of  the  people  and  for  the  most  effective  allocation  of
       resources;


  (3) confirms its support for Census Week; and


  (4) calls on all South Africans to co-operate with the  census  officials
       and to stand and be counted.

Agreed to.

  1993 (Act No 90 of 1993), designates Mr M A Mzizi to replace Prof L  B  G
  Ndabandaba on the Magistrates Commission.

                      AGRICULTURAL DEBT MANAGEMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker,  hon  members,
a number of us here will recall that, from 1994 and until about  1999,  part
of my responsibility as Deputy  Minister  was  to  look  after  agricultural
finance. At that time my Minister was an hon member  sitting  here  in  this
House, hon Van Niekerk.

He told me that there were two important  things  in  agriculture,  one  was
credit and the other marketing. I  wondered  what  was  so  important  about
finance, except that I, as an individual, also knew that without  money  one
can do very little.

Apart from agricultural finance and marketing, the  other  important  things
in agriculture were land, extension services  and  research.  These  matters
continue to be important, even today. We all know,  and  would  agree,  that
all entrepreneurs, including farmers, need credit in  order  to  effectively
invest in activities of farming to provide food for all of us, but  also  to
ensure that they can realise some income  out  of  the  products  that  they
produce. Such products may not  only  be  used  for  purposes  of  household
consumption, but can also be used in other industrial  activities  that  can
increase our economic growth.

The challenge of credit has always been how to utilise  money  in  a  manner
that assists us to do what we intend to  do.  Particularly  in  agriculture,
those responsible for giving credit always look  at  the  stability  of  the
sector. Agriculture has always been regarded by  everybody  as  one  of  the
very high risk industries. But it is important to say that,  no  matter  how
risky it is, it is a necessary sector  and  a  necessary  industry  for  any
country.

Historically, credit and financial support was used to establish  the  South
African agricultural sector that we are all proud of today. It is  important
to note that  it  was  also  this  element  that  was  effectively  used  to
discriminate  against  those  who  were  not  part  of  the  mainstream   of
agriculture.

We know that there were some interventions in the past, particularly by  the
various homeland governments. But all of us also know part  of  the  problem
was the way in which credit was extended and managed  afterwards.  That  was
always a cause for concern.

For this reason we sought to amend the Agricultural Credit Act in  1995.  We
wanted to bring it into line with our new Constitution and to expand  it  to
include all farmers,  regardless  of  race  and  gender.  But  the  question
persisted: How do we deal with rural finance in South Africa?

We  all  realise  that  at  that  time,  rural  farmers  of  this   country,
particularly  those  in  the  former  homelands  and  on  trustlands,  faced
challenges such as  commercial  farmer  institutions  which  found  it  very
difficult to lend money to people in those areas. Issues  of  administrative
expenses linked to distances and many others were raised.

From 1995 to 1997 there were various reviews, searching  for  ways  to  make
finance  accessible  to  all  South  Africans,  particularly   rural   South
Africans. In 1996 the hon member  Derek  Hanekom,  who  was  Minister  then,
approached former President Mandela to appoint  the  Strauss  commission  to
investigate and look comprehensively at  agricultural  finance  systems  and
rural finance in particular.

Out of that process came recommendations that we as Government accepted  and
we had to act. One of those was to eliminate the  role  of  Government  from
direct lending, or managing a loan book, if one may call it that. We had  to
ensure that Government could make some interventions to assist  the  sector.
The challenge we had to face was how to amend the  Agricultural  Credit  Act
while ensuring, at the same time, that the Land Bank attends  to  the  needs
of farmers in the broader sense. Hon members will recall that that  was  one
of the things that happened.

If we look back at what happened with the Agricultural Credit Act, this  was
one of the most comprehensive mechanisms around which we used to  build  the
commercial farmers of today. Hon members will also recall that we used  this
instrument to finance all other matters not  regarded  as  core  matters  in
agriculture.

I will not bore  hon  members  with  the  details,  but  some  members  will
remember that some of our farmers were not just farmers, but were also  used
as commandos on the borders to protect the  old  South  Africa.  There  were
other  issues  that  were  cushioned  around  the  Agricultural   Act   and,
therefore, we had to deal with them.

We must also realise that in  managing  the  Agricultural  Credit  Act,  the
realities were that a number of farmers did not  necessarily  pay  back  the
state. If they had many other financial institutions  that  they  owed,  the
Agricultural Credit Board was the last in the line. Interestingly,  when  we
had to take particular action, and I asked one of the farmers as to  why  it
had  been  difficult  for  him  to  pay,  given  the  fact  that  he  sought
Ministerial intervention so that I had to make sure that  my  officials  did
not come after him, he said:


  You know, Minister, firstly, Agricultural Credit Act money is very cheap.
  Secondly, you know that the state is very patient. Therefore, when I have
  to decide between paying you, on the one hand, and Standard Bank and FNB,
  on the other, it is always easier for me to choose FNB and Standard Bank,
  and you are the last in  the  line,  because  I  can  come  and  ask  for
  consolidation and you will be very sympathetic.

I said: ``Well, things have to change. If you borrow money, you must pay  it
back.''

So, the Bill that we are proposing, that this Parliament must assist  us  to
approve, is to ensure that the money that was  lent  to  farmers,  which  is
money that we pay as a result of tax, must be paid back.

The fact that we had to rationalise the Agricultural  Credit  Act  does  not
mean that  those  people  must  get  away  with  it  and  say:  ``Since  the
instrument is not there, therefore,  there  is  no  need  to  pay  back  the
money.'' This money is still required  for  assistance,  not  just  for  the
developing sector of this country, but for all farmers who are  actually  in
need of that resource.

One interesting thing about this Bill is that it allows this  Parliament  to
appropriate  money  annually  from  that  fund  for  specific  use  in   the
interventions that are necessary  for  agricultural  development.  As  South
Africans we have learned the lesson that whatever intervention  we  seek  to
make, we must ensure that it does not distort our own  domestic  market  and
our international markets.

However, it is necessary that we must have an instrument  through  which  we
can be able to support  our  farmers.  That  is  the  principle.  But,  more
importantly, working with the Ministry of Finance,  the  proposed  amendment
to the Act allows us to provide that intervention,  transparently  and  with
accountability. But, it also strengthens our arm to continue to collect  the
debt that has been owed to the state for a number of years.

I am happy to report to this House that since  the  rationalisation  of  the
Agricultural Credit Act, we have continued to collect  money.  As  we  speak
today, we  have  approximately  R800  million  in  the  Agricultural  Credit
Account. We want to continue to improve on that level of debt collection.

While the Act allows us to write off debt, we  are  not  going  to  do  that
willy-nilly. We will make sure that where debt must be written off,  we  are
satisfied that, indeed, the farmer concerned cannot  pay  back  that  money,
given whatever circumstances. But, we will make sure that, indeed,  we  come
true to all members of the public and  that  the  money  that  they  pay  to
assist with the development of the sector is looked after in an  appropriate
manner.
I would like to thank members of the portfolio  committee  for  the  way  in
which they have worked with the Ministry to ensure that we get this Bill  to
this House today. I hope that all members will support  the  Bill,  as  they
supported it in the committee. [Applause.]

Adv S P HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, it gives me immense pleasure  to  speak  on
behalf of the ANC in support of the Agricultural Debt Management  Bill.  The
Bill constitutes yet another measure by our democratic nonracial  Government
to redress the imbalances of  our  apartheid  past.  Over  many  years,  the
apartheid government rendered  financial  and  other  forms  of  support  to
practising and aspirant white farmers to the total exclusion of the rest  of
the South African population. The assistance given to those farmers  was  in
the form of various financial schemes and  loans  which  were  repayable  on
favourable terms. Owing  to  various  reasons  and  in  spite  of  the  said
favourable terms, a large number of those farmers have  still  not  paid  up
their debts.

To a large extent, the  loans  were  extended  under  the  auspices  of  the
Agricultural Credit Board. The Agricultural  Credit  Board  has  since  been
disbanded and some of the money that was recovered from the farmers lies  in
the Agricultural Credit Account. In  terms  of  this  amending  Bill,  money
collected as  part  of  agricultural  debt  recovery  will  be  administered
through the Agricultural  Debt  Account.  At  the  present  moment,  as  the
Minister has  indicated,  the  money  that  has  been  collected  stands  at
approximately R837 million, while  the  amount  still  outstanding  is  also
approximately R800 million.

It was the wish of the portfolio committee  that  this  money  be  insulated
from the rest of the funds of the  National  Revenue  Fund.  We  would  have
preferred  that  the  money  in  this  account  be  set  aside  to  be  used
exclusively for the new entrants to the commercial  farming  sector  without
its being subjected to appropriation by Parliament. The loans, however,  had
been allocated from moneys belonging to the national fiscus.  It  stands  to
reason, therefore, that when the debts have been recovered the money  should
go back to the National Revenue Fund.

Being fully conscious of the constitutional  right  of  Parliament  to  make
appropriations at its own discretion, without being dictated to  by  anyone,
we have, however, managed to include  provisions  in  the  Bill  which  will
ensure that  the  money  in  the  account  will  be  used  for  purposes  of
agricultural development programmes. The sweet irony of all of this is  that
this money which,  as  I  have  said,  was  previously  set  aside  for  the
exclusive use of white  South  Africans,  will  now  be  available  for  the
development and upliftment of those who were previously excluded.  We  would
thus urge hon members to take the message and bring  it  to  aspirant  black
commercial farmers that there is money available to them as well under  this
Government of equal opportunities.

It pleases me to report that all  participating  members  of  the  portfolio
committee were at one in wishing that this money be used for  the  promotion
of black farmers. This,  I  hope,  is  a  sign  of  things  to  come  and  a
commitment by all of us to the ideal  of  a  better  life  for  all  of  our
people.

At the recent annual conference  of  Agri  SA  in  Mpumalanga,  I  found  it
extremely encouraging to hear  some  of  the  delegates  to  the  conference
saying: ``It is far better to have an affluent and satisfied neighbour  than
to have a miserable, poor one.'' They were, of  course,  talking  about  the
need for white  commercial  farmers  to  use  their  skills,  expertise  and
experience to assist aspirant black farmers to grow by giving them  training
and other forms of support. This humanitarian  gesture,  we  hope,  will  be
extended to address the plight of labour tenants and farmworkers  who  still
do not own land of their own. As the ANC, we accordingly support this  Bill.
[Applause.]

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, the  hon  the  Minister  would  recollect
that we had an interesting  experience  regarding  the  Agricultural  Credit
Act. When I became a Deputy Minister in 1986  I  asked  the  then  Minister:
``What must I do?'' He replied: ``I will tell you tomorrow.'' The  next  day
when I got there he looked at me and said: ``I think that you should  manage
the Agricultural Credit Act.'' That is where I learnt  something  about  the
problems of agriculture. In 1994, the new Deputy Minister who was  appointed
came to me and asked: ``What must I do?'' I said to her: ``I will  tell  you
tomorrow.'' The next day I said to her: ``I think that you  should  take  on
the Agricultural Credit Act.'' That is how one learns about the problems  of
agriculture. When one works with credit and  the  problems  of  agriculture,
one learns how finance works.

Regarding the Bill that is before us today, I think that  we  agree  to  the
changes introduced by it and we will support it. I think that the debt  that
has remained should be managed and used for agriculture. I think  that  that
is important. So, I will not speak about it.

Die Wet op Landboukrediet is baie jare lank al van krag en  het  baie  boere
gehelp om gevestig te raak. In dié proses het  skuld  opgebou.  Daar  is  'n
verwagting dat dié skuld aan landboukrediet afgeskryf kan word. Ek meen  die
Minister het baie duidelik gesê dat dit nie gaan gebeur nie, en dit  is  reg
so. Behalwe vir die sowat 7 000 boere wat steeds sowat 12 000  rekeninge  by
landboukrediet het, is daar duisende boere wat wel die spel gespeel  en  hul
skuld oor 'n tydperk betaal het. Dit  sal  onregverdig  wees  as  dié  skuld
afgeskryf sou word. Ek meen mense moet daarvan kennis neem.

Ek wil praat oor die geskiedenis van  die  Wet  op  Landboukrediet  wat  ons
vandag afskaf. Na my mening is dit jammer dat dit gebeur. Hoewel dié wet  in
die verlede probleme geskep het as gevolg van die regime,  of  die  regering
van die dag, het hy 'n belangrike rol gespeel  om  boere  wat  nie  geld  of
kennis gehad het nie, te help om gevestig te raak.

As  voorbeeld  verwys  ek  na  die  ontwikkeling  by  Kakamas,   Boegoeberg,
Loskopdam en Vaalharts waar daar niks was nie.  Geen  finansiële  instelling
wou mense help om daar te gaan boer nie. Uiteindelik was daar 'n stelsel  en
'n wet.  Landboukredietkomitees  bestaande  uit  verantwoordelike  lede  het
mense geïdentifiseer wat vir hulp kwalifiseer  en  só  het  die  departement
gehelp om boere te vestig. Hulle is teen 'n  baie  lae  rentekoers  geldelik
gehelp. Dit het daartoe gelei  dat  mense  die  eerste  vyf  tot  tien  jaar
suksesvol kon boer en kon oorleef.

Vandag boer hoogs suksesvolle boere  by  Kakamas,  Boegoeberg,  Loskop,  die
Springbokvlakte en oor die hele land, en hulle het  almal  daar  begin.  Dis
jammer dat dié wet nie omvorm word om steeds 'n  bydrae  te  lewer  tot  die
vestiging van nuwe boere in ons grondhervormingsproses  nie.  Na  my  mening
vorder dié proses te stadig en moet dit baie meer momentum kry.

Miskien  is  een  van  die  redes  daarvoor  dat  ons  van  te  veel   ander
organisasies gebruik wil maak en op te veel ander wette  wil  steun  om,  op
dieselfde wyse, sukses met grondhervorming en die vestiging van  nuwe  boere
te behaal. Ek weet nie, maar ek voorspel dat ons oor vyf jaar  van  nou  af,
wanneer  ons  miskien  steeds  sukkel  met  grondhervorming  omdat  dit   so
verspreid is, weer  'n  landboukredietwet  sal  hê  en  dat  mense  van  die
gemeenskap weer verantwoordelikheid sal neem en toekennings sal maak.  Hulle
sal besluit wie moet kry en wie nie, en help om  die  inwerkingstelling  van
grondhervorming op die platteland momentum te gee.

Ek  wil  ook  graag  by  dié  geleentheid  hulde  bring  aan  die   duisende
landboukredietkomiteelede  wat  jare  lank   vrywillig   in   elke   distrik
verantwoordelikheid aanvaar het om die staat se geld aan te  wend  om  boere
te help ... [Tussenwerpsels.] Hulle het hulle gehelp. Ek het  mos  gesê  ons
moet dié beginsel omvorm.

Ek wil net dankie sê vir mense wat gehelp het om landbou te vestig, vir  die
Landboukredietraad en vir amptenare in die departement wat nog  steeds  daar
is. Ons moet daardie kundigheid wat oor jare opgebou is, omvorm  en  aanwend
sodat ons werklik aan die behoeftes kan voldoen van  mense  wat  vandag  tot
die landbou wil toetree. Sodoende kan ons die probleem  regstel  waarna  die
agb lid verwys het en waarmee ek saamstem. Nietemin is die kennis en  vermoë
daar; ons moet dit nie op grond van ander omstandighede  eenkant  toe  skuif
nie.

Hier is 'n geleentheid waarbinne ons dit kan inspan sodat ons 'n beter Suid-
Afrika kan kry, sodat ons die nodige nuwe boere kan vestig en sodat ons  dié
nuwe boere die vermoë kan gee om gedurende die eerste vier  tot  vyf  maande
en vier tot vyf jaar te kan  oorleef.(Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[The Agricultural Credit Act has been  in  force  for  many  years  and  has
helped to establish many farmers. In this process  debt  accumulated.  There
is an expectation that this debt to agricultural  credit  could  be  written
off. I think the Minister said very clearly  that  this  was  not  going  to
happen, and rightly so. Apart from the about 7 000 farmers  who  still  have
about 12 000 accounts with  agricultural  credit,  there  are  thousands  of
farmers who in fact played the game and paid their debt  over  a  period  of
time. It would be unfair if this debt were to be written off. I  think  that
people should take note of this.

I want to speak about the history of the Agricultural  Credit  Act  that  we
are abolishing today. In my view it is regrettable that this  is  happening.
Although this Act created problems in the past owing to the regime,  or  the
government of the day, it played an important role in helping  to  establish
farmers who did not have money or knowledge, to establish themselves.

As  an  example  I  would  like  to  mention  the  development  at  Kakemas,
Boegoeberg, Loskop Dam and Vaalharts, where there was nothing. No  financial
institution would help people to go and farm there. Eventually there  was  a
system  and  an  Act.   Agricultural   credit   committees   consisting   of
responsible members identified people who qualified for  assistance  and  in
this way the department helped to  establish  farmers.  They  were  assisted
financially at a very low interest rate. This meant that people  could  farm
successfully and survive the first five to ten years.

Today highly successful farmers farm at  Kakemas,  Boegoeberg,  Loskop,  the
Springbokvlakte and right across the country, and they  all  started  there.
It is a pity that this Act  is  not  being  transformed  to  keep  making  a
contribution to  the  establishment  of  new  farmers  in  our  land  reform
process. In my view this process is progressing too slowly and  should  gain
far greater momentum.

Perhaps one of the reasons for that is that we want to use  too  many  other
organisations and rely on too many other laws  to  achieve  similar  success
with land reform and the establishment of new farmers. I do not know, but  I
predict that in five years from now, when we are  perhaps  still  struggling
with land reform, because it is so widespread, we will once  again  have  an
agricultural credit Act and that people of the  community  will  once  again
accept responsibility and make allocations. They will decide  who  must  get
and who not, and help to give momentum to putting land reform in  the  rural
areas into operation.

I would also on this occasion like  to  pay  tribute  to  the  thousands  of
agricultural  credit  committee  members  who  for  many  years  voluntarily
accepted responsibility in each district for applying the state's  money  to
help farmers ... [Interjections.] They helped them. Surely I have said  that
we should transform this principle.

I just want to say thank  you  to  those  people  who  helped  to  establish
agriculture, to the Agricultural  Credit  Board  and  to  officials  in  the
department who are still there. We must transform  and  use  that  expertise
that has been built up over the years, so that we can really meet the  needs
of people who want to enter agriculture today. In so doing  we  can  rectify
the problem to which the hon member made reference, and with which I  agree.
The knowledge and ability are nevertheless there;  we  should  not  move  it
aside on the basis of other circumstances.

This is an opportunity for us to harness it in order  to  achieve  a  better
South Africa, so that we can help to establish the new farmers and  so  that
we can give these new farmers the ability to survive during the  first  four
to five months and four to five years.]

It is impossible for a new farmer, in the difficult  farming  conditions  of
South Africa, to survive the economic problems, the droughts  and  all  that
comes to a farmer. If we do not have remedies for that, I am sorry,  but  we
will not succeed in establishing new farmers.

Groot boere het die vermoë om  te  oorleef  omdat  hulle  'n  infrastruktuur
opgebou het. Jong boere het staatsgeld nodig wat die staat bereid moet  wees
om op billike wyse af te  skryf  sodat  nuwe  boere  gevestig  kan  word  en
suksesvol kan wees.

Ek steun die wetsontwerp en hoop dat die amptenare oor gouer as vyf jaar  'n
nuwe wetsontwerp sal skryf waarin al die aksies van grondhervorming  in  een
aksie aangepak word en dat dit naastenby soos die ou  landboukredietwet  sal
wees. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Large farmers have the ability to survive, because they have  built  up  an
infrastructure. Young farmers need government funds that  the  state  should
be prepared to write off in a reasonable manner so that  new  farmers  could
be established and achieve success.

I support the Bill and hope that the officials will  draft  a  new  Bill  in
less than five years in which all the actions of land reform are tackled  at
once and that it would be more or less  like  the  old  agricultural  credit
Act. [Applause.]]

Mr G B BHENGU: Madam Speaker and the hon House, I am grateful to be able  to
speak after the former Minister, Dr Van Niekerk. From his  address,  it  has
become clear that he was able, during his time  as  Minister,  to  create  a
mechanism which was able to sustain white commercial farmers. He  is  giving
the Minister the task of creating a mechanism through which  aspirant  black
farmers can graduate so as to be commercial farmers. They were  given  loans
which ended up as being free and they are  failing  even  to  repay  a  loan
without interest, because the government of that time did it  for  political
purposes. It is good that it comes from his mouth that it  is  going  to  be
very difficult for black aspirant farmers, because they will be required  to
compete with them. Whereas they had a free lunch for years,  now  our  black
farmers are expected to compete with them in this world, or global economy.

The IFP supports the Bill as it aims to consolidate and  rationalise  pieces
of  legislation  that  regulate  the  agricultural  debt  created   by   the
Agricultural Credit Act. We applaud the Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs for putting its house  in  order,  so  that  precise  and  efficient
management of this debt is effected. This will prompt  proper  recycling  of
money that was regulated by the remnants of repealed legislation.

What is more important about this Bill is that  the  debt  will  not  be  be
written off automatically, but will still remain owing on the  part  of  the
debtors. That  will  in  turn  assist  other  farmers  or  agricultural  co-
operatives  needing  funds  to  develop  and  maintain  their   agricultural
activities.  We  also  believe  that  it  must  specifically  be  used   for
development purposes, so that the aspirant farmers could  be  able  to  find
assistance from this fund.

We would like to appeal to the Ministry and  the  department  that  it  will
neither be politically nor economically expedient to rush headlong with  the
transfer of surplus money to the National  Revenue  Fund.  I  am  sure  that
there will be so much surplus money within the next few  years  since  there
is a lot of redress in terms of funding of the  aspirant  and  the  emerging
farmers, especially the Africans. Experience has shown that it is  not  easy
to get back money that has been transferred to the  National  Revenue  Fund,
because the Department of  Finance,  in  terms  of  its  national  budgetary
needs, prioritises it.

We are therefore also pleased to note that the Bill aims  at  ensuring  that
the agricultural debt account is properly audited, so  that  all  moneys  in
this account are used in accordance with proper business  plans.  This  will
serve to ensure that value for money is derived from the expanded fund.

The IFP believes that the repayment of the  moneys  owed  by  the  creditors
should not depend on how agricultural production fared during the period  of
the loan  or  receiving  assistance  from  the  fund.  It  will  not  be  in
accordance with the loan to derive a return to help other  needy  people  in
future, but it will be an ``operation hunger''  type  of  loan.  A  loan  is
supposed to be repaid, no matter what the level  of  production  output  for
which it was loaned. It is a debt, not a handout. It should,  therefore,  be
treated as such. The IFP supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I rise in support  of  this  particular  measure.
What I would like to highlight is that if one looks  at  the  original  Act,
the Agricultural Credit Act, Act 28 of  1966,  which  has  been  amended  no
fewer than 18 times subsequently by various other Acts, there is a  note  in
this copy from Juta's, which says the following:


  Note: This Act, as it had applied to the own  affairs  of  the  House  of
  Assembly, was made applicable throughout the Republic ...

The point I want to make is that the facility that was provided in terms  of
the Agricultural Credit Act  of  1966  was  exclusively  for  white  people.
Another law  was  created  to  assist  coloured  people,  by  the  erstwhile
Coloured Persons' Representative Council, which created a body known as  the
Coloured Persons' Agricultural Assistance Board. One  is  grateful  that  we
are rationalising all these Acts.

One of the highlights  regarding  this  Bill  before  us  is  something  the
chairperson of the portfolio committee alluded  to,  that  there  was  total
agreement that the funds generated from the collection of  the  debt  should
be utilised for agricultural development programmes. What  we  had  in  mind
here was to help the  new  entrants  on  the  road  to  becoming  successful
farmers, a very important development supported by all parties.

We are  given  to  understand  that  the  current  credit  balance  in  this
particular debt management account is R837 million. Of course,  this  amount
is supposed to grow because there are still outstanding debts. But I  notice
that the orange light is flickering already. I just  quickly  want  to  tell
the hon the Minister that the other processes  through  which  upcoming  new
entrants can be assisted are basically the commercial  banks  and  the  Land
Bank. In order to assist people on the road to becoming successful  farmers,
we will seriously have to look at certain mechanisms. I am not pleading  for
the return of the Agricultural Credit Act,  but  I  believe  that  something
will have to be done in order to assist new entrants  who  unfortunately  do
not qualify.

Furthermore, as far as  the  Land  Bank  is  concerned,  I  think  that  the
questions that are asked when one applies for a loan  are  onerous,  and  we
should also look at that.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mev die Speaker, ons het gehoor die Wetsontwerp  op  die
Bestuur van Landbouskuld vervang die ou Wet  op  Landboukrediet  en  die  ou
Landboukredietraad.

Die agb Minister het ook gesê dié wetsontwerp  bevat  'n  klousule  wat  die
Regering magtig om skuld af te skryf. Agb lede  het  ook  gehoor  die  skuld
waarvan ons hier praat, beloop sowat R837 miljoen.

Die VF vra dat dié skuld afgeskryf moet word,  want  die  vraag  is:  Hoekom
nie? Landbou is een van die grootste  werkverskaffingsektore  in  ons  land.
Die landbou is die enigste sektor wat vir ons kos op die tafel  sit;  hy  is
die voedselvoorsiener. Die dag as die landbou nie meer gesond is nie,  dreig
'n volk om te begin honger ly.
As daar vrae is oor die R837 miljoen, kan ons met reg sê:  Kom  ons  kyk  na
plaaslike regering. Met die oorgang van  1993  na  1994  is  miljarde  rande
skuld van  swart  plaaslike  regerings  eenvoudig  afgeskryf.  Tans  is  die
uitstaande skuld van mense wat nie vir hul  water  en  dienste  betaal  nie,
meer as R12 miljard. Dit is meer as  die  totale  verdedigingsbegroting  van
Suid-Afrika. Die sentrale ANC-regering skryf van tyd tot tyd  eenvoudig  van
dié skuld af.

Daarom sê die VF boere se skuld moet ook afgeskryf word.  Die  landbousektor
is afhanklik van die natuur en word bedreig deur droogtes, en daarom is  dit
nie altyd in die hande van boere nie. Dit is nie altyd as  gevolg  van  swak
bestuur dat skuld oploop nie. Daarom vra ons dat dié skuld  afgeskryf  word.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, we have heard that the Agricultural  Debt
Management Bill replaces  the  old  Agricultural  Credit  Act  and  the  old
Agricultural Credit Board.

The  hon  the  Minister  also  said  that  this  Bill  contained  a   clause
authorising the Government to write off debt. Hon members  have  also  heard
that the debt that we are talking about here amounts to  approximately  R837
million.

The FF wants to ask that this  debt  should  be  written  off,  because  the
question is: Why not?  Agriculture  is  one  of  the  largest  providers  of
employment in our country. Agriculture is the only sector that puts food  on
the table for us; it is the food supplier. The day that  agriculture  is  no
longer sound, a nation is threatened with starvation.

If there are questions about the R837 million debt we  may  very  well  say:
Let us look at local government. With  the  transition  from  1993  to  1994
billions of rands in debt of black local  authorities  were  simply  written
off. At present the outstanding debt of people who  do  not  pay  for  their
water and services is over R12 billion. This is  more  than  South  Africa's
entire defence budget. The central ANC Government  simply  writes  off  this
debt from time to time.

That is why the FF says the debt of farmers should also be written off.  The
agricultural sector at the mercy of nature and is  threatened  by  droughts,
and therefore it is not always in the hands of farmers.  It  is  not  always
owing to poor management that debts accumulate. We therefore ask  that  this
debt should be written off.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, we as  the  UCDP  wish  to
register our party's view with regard to the  Agricultural  Debt  Management
Bill by initially applauding all the relevant  stakeholders  consulted,  who
contributed and continue to provide sound advice as to how the Bill  in  its
current form can be improved  and  thus  made  effective  in  achieving  its
stated objectives.

We also want to emphasize that since  the  Bill  seeks  to  rationalise  and
consolidate the different remnants of pieces  of  legislation  dealing  with
agricultural debt in its various forms, certain parts of  the  Bill  in  its
current state require a rethink by the committee.

The area that I am  referring  to  concerns  clause  4(2)(d)  and  reads  as
follows:


  ... any amount appropriated  by  Parliament  for  agricultural  or  other
  purposes must be transferred to the National Revenue Fund ...

Furthermore, clause 5 of the Bill is not only problematic in our  view  but,
it would seem, is inimical to achieving the broader aims and  objectives  of
the Bill, as it would disempower the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs and deny it  the  much-needed  revenue  or  resources  to  fund  the
already  cash-strapped  agricultural   development   project,   particularly
support to emerging farmers whose needs are diverse.

We further have to point out that  our  main  concern  with  the  identified
clause that seeks to empower  the  National  Revenue  Fund  to  receive  any
surplus amount accrued  from  Agricultural  Debt  Management  is  that  this
clause creates a situation whereby, once the National Revenue Fund  receives
any transfers, it would be difficult, if not  impossible,  to  redirect  the
money back to the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs  to  fund
relevant agricultural projects.

The UCDP supports the Bill. However, we would have preferred that clauses  4
and 5 were drafted in such a manner  that  funds  collected  would  be  made
available to  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs  for  the
developmental programme of emerging  farmers.  On  the  whole  the  Bill  is
desirable and should be supported by all and sundry. [Time expired.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam  Speaker,  the  PAC  supports  the  Agricultural  Debt
Management Bill. One of its purposes is to establish the  Agricultural  Debt
Account and to provide for the use of this account as a mechanism to  manage
agricultural debt repayment.

The Agricultural Debt Management Bill is to replace the Agricultural  Credit
Act of 1966. This Act used to provide assistance to persons carrying  on  or
undertaking to carry on farming operations and used to exercise  control  in
respect of the assistance rendered.

The PAC understands that in spite of the cessation of  the  credit  delivery
function, there are  still  outstanding  debts  in  the  form  of  financial
assistance which have been rendered in terms of the Act, and  are  still  to
be paid. The Bill provides for the continuation and  administration  of  the
Agricultural Credit Account, which shall now be known  as  the  Agricultural
Debt Account in  accordance  with  this  Bill  on  debt  collection.  It  is
critically important that debt repayment be made so that the utilisation  of
funds in the account for agricultural development and finance  purposes,  in
accordance with a business  plan,  can  be  submitted  to  the  Minister  in
consultation with the Minister of Finance.

The PAC, however, would have been happier to see this Bill putting  emphasis
on assisting especially African farmers who  were  denied  opportunities  to
farm, by being subsidised and well trained. The future of  farming  and  the
success of agriculture largely depend on farmers  who  are  local  investors
and have nowhere to go. At present a number of African  farmers  are  poorly
assisted. Without financial assistance for  them  from  the  Government  the
future of  agriculture  in  this  country  and  food  production  are  being
endangered.

Mnr  A  J  BOTHA:  Agb  Speaker,  agb  Minister,  die  bespreking   in   die
portefeuljekomitee  oor  hierdie  wetsontwerp  het  'n  eenparige   begeerte
geïdentifiseer. Dit is  die  begeerte  om  soveel  fondse  as  moontlik  vir
grondhervorming en die vestiging van ontluikende boere beskikbaar  te  stel.
Indien die reëls ons verhoed het om die kapitaal betrokke by hierdie  fondse
spesifiek vir die doel te eien, dan is hierdie  eenparige  begeerte  van  al
die lede van al die partye tog dat ons daarin geslaag het om die belang  van
en  die  moontlikheid  van  doelgerigte  samewerking  te  beklemtoon.  Sulke
samewerking  sal  vorentoe  broodnodig  wees  om  'n  sukses  te  maak   van
grondhervorming, wat in sy wese 'n ingewikkelde fisieke  proses  is  met  'n
veelvoud van fasette.

'n Wyse persoon en gesoute boer van  die  Noord-Kaap  -  'n  vriend  van  my
kollega dr Van Niekerk - het die kern van die  saak  soos   volg  saamgevat:
``Dit is maklik om 'n mens te maak, maar om 'n boer van 'n mens te maak,  is
'n ander saak.'' Dit is ironies dat die mens eintlik belangriker is  as  die
grond wanneer ons praat van grondhervorming. Die grond is maar  altyd  daar,
dit is die toegang van die mens  tot  enige  besondere  stuk  grond  en  die
gehalte van daardie toegang wat belangrik is.

Die gehalte van toegang word deur verskeie faktore  bepaal.   Eerstens  moet
die projek ekonomies haalbaar wees. Tweedens moet die  mens  bemagtig  word.
'n Ondernemer word gebore en verg slegs geleenthede  om  te  ontwikkel.  Die
meeste van ons is egter  nie  inherent  ondernemers  nie  en  kan  alleenlik
bemagtig  word  deur   bestuursvaardighede   aan   te   leer.   Sonder   die
bestuursvaardighede is  die  toegang  ook  onder  standaard  en  gedoem  tot
mislukking.
Derdens moet aanvaar word dat die proses om 'n onreg van die verlede reg  te
stel 'n kunsmatige proses is en dus kunsmatige steun vereis om  die  toegang
te laat slaag. 'n Reeds moeilike proses word nog moeiliker  gemaak  deur  'n
ongunstige ekonomiese klimaat waarin boere opereer. Dit is  algemeen  bekend
dat die aantal boere jaarliks verminder as gevolg van  hierdie  situasie  en
die ekonomiese insinking wat  volg  op  die  terreuraanslag  in  Amerika  en
elders sal sekerlik nie van veel hulp wees nie.

Net soos die wêreld reageer op  daardie  tragedie  deur  saam  te  staan  om
internasionale terrorisme  die  hoof  te  bied,  net  so  moet  ons  na  ons
ongunstige ekonomiese situasie kyk om te sien of ons dit nie kan gebruik  om
'n verskeidenheid van  behoeftes  aan  te  spreek  nie.  Staatsinmenging  om
ekonomiese toestande te ondervang, het in die verlede al meer kwaad as  goed
gedoen en moet sekerlik vermy word, veral wanneer dit  markkragte  verwring.
Terselfdertyd het ons reeds besluit om grondhervorming te bewerkstellig  met
ingryping en moet ons nou probeer om iets positief te haal uit 'n  negatiewe
ekonomiese situasie.

Ons kan dit doen deur alle  dreigende  plaasinsolvensies  te  beskou  as  'n
geleentheid vir  grondhervorming.  In  stede  daarvan  dat  sulke  boerderye
ontbind word  by  wyse  van  uitverkoping,  kan  hulle  as  lopende  eenhede
oorgeneem word. Dit kan gedoen word deur die skuldlas oor  te  neem  en  die
rolverdeling van alle deelnemers op die plaas op sy kop om te keer.

So word die huidige werknemers aspirantboere, terwyl  die  huidige  boer  'n
aspirantbestuurder word vir die onderneming, en optree  as  instrukteur  vir
aspirantboere. Die vee en die losgoed bly net  so  op  die  plaas,  wat  die
koste van grondhervorming dramaties kan verlaag.

So 'n proses kan vinnig en op 'n baie groot skaal in  werking  gestel  word.
Dit sal nie alleen 'n groot  bydrae  kan  maak  tot  die  normalisering  van
landbou nie, maar ook meewerk om landbou meer mededingend te maak.

Hierdie is slegs een van vele planne wat op die tafel is en  wat  baie  goed
kan werk, maar almal van hulle sal geweldig baie  kapitaal  verg.  Aangesien
ons in hierdie amendement nie daarin kan  slaag  om  die  kapitaal  te  help
vaslê vir landbou en vir hierdie doel nie, vra ek die Parlement  om  by  die
volgende geleentheid wanneer ons oor hierdie pos stem dit in gedagte te  hou
en dan nie suinig te wees om die nodige  kapitaal  beskikbaar  te  stel  vir
landbou en grondhervorming nie. Dit sal van ons 'n voorbeeld in  Afrika  kan
maak in stede van een van die probleemgevalle.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A J BOTHA: Hon Speaker, hon Minister, the discussion  in  the  portfolio
committee on this Bill identified a unanimous desire. That is the desire  to
make available  as  much  funding  as  possible  for  land  reform  and  the
establishment of emerging farmers. If the rules prevent us from  identifying
the capital involved in this funding  specifically  for  this  purpose,  the
unanimous desire of all the members of all  the  parties  is  then  that  we
should  succeed  in  emphasising  the  importance  and  the  possibility  of
purposeful co-operation. Such co-operation will be essential in  the  future
to make a success  of  land  reform,  which  is  in  essence  a  complicated
physical process with a multitude of facets.

A wise person and experienced farmer from the Northern Cape -  a  friend  of
my colleague Dr Van  Niekerk  -  captured  the  essence  of  the  matter  as
follows: ``It is easy to make a person, but  to  make  a  farmer  out  of  a
person is another matter.'' It is  ironic  that  people  are  actually  more
important than land when we talk about land reform. Land  is  simply  always
there. It is the access of people to any particular piece of  land  and  the
quality of that access which is important.

The quality of  access  is  determined  by  various  factors.  Firstly,  the
project  must  be  economically  attainable.  Secondly,   people   must   be
empowered. An entrepreneur  is  born  and  requires  only  opportunities  to
develop. However, most of us are not natural entrepreneurs and can  only  be
empowered by acquiring management  skills.  Without  management  skills  the
access is then also below standard and doomed to failure.

Thirdly, it must be accepted that the process to  rectify  an  injustice  of
the past is an artificial process and therefore requires artificial  support
to allow the access to succeed. An already difficult process  is  made  even
more  difficult  by  an  unfavourable  economic  climate  in  which  farmers
operate. It is generally known that  the  number  of  farmers  is  declining
annually as a result of this situation and the economic recession  following
the terror attack in America and elsewhere will certainly  not  do  much  to
assist the situation.
In the same way that the world is  reacting  to  that  tragedy  by  standing
together  to  combat  international  terrorism,  we   must   look   at   our
unfavourable economic climate to see whether we cannot use it to  address  a
variety of needs. State interference to  intervene  in  economic  conditions
has done more harm than good in the past  and  must  certainly  be  avoided,
particularly when it distorts market forces.  At  the  same  time,  we  have
already decided to achieve land reform by way of intervention  and  we  must
now try to get something positive out of a negative economic situation.

We can do this by viewing all potential farm insolvencies as an  opportunity
for land reform. Instead of such farms being dissolved by  being  sold  off,
they can be taken over as active units. This can be done by taking over  the
debt and by reversing the role of all participants on the farm.

In this way  the  current  employees  become  aspiring  farmers,  while  the
current farmer becomes an aspiring manager for the undertaking, and acts  as
an instructor for aspiring  farmers.  The  livestock  and  movable  property
remain as they are on the farm, which can drastically reduce  the  costs  of
land reform.

Such a process can be set in operation quickly and on a  very  large  scale.
It will not only be able to make a large contribution to  the  normalisation
of agriculture, but can also assist in making agriculture more  competitive.


This is but one of many plans which are on the  table  and  which  can  work
very well, but all of them will require a great deal of capital. As we  were
unable in this amendment to help acquire the  capital  for  agriculture  and
for this purpose, I ask Parliament to bear this in mind next  time  we  vote
on this Vote and then not to be miserly  in  making  the  necessary  capital
available for agriculture and land reform. This would  allow  us  to  be  an
example in Africa, instead of one of the problem cases. [Applause.]]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, being the largest economy on the  continent,
South Africa is made up of diverse societies and  economic  markets.  Though
renowned for its rich mineral resources, namely diamonds,  our  economy  has
been left to cope with  the  poverty  and  inequality  imposed  upon  us  by
colonialism and the apartheid era.

The MF  acknowledges  the  financial  assistance  that  has  been  given  to
farmers. This Bill facilitates an account for the collection of such  debts.
The provisions made appear to provide direction and clarity,  which  clearly
makes  available  better  management  of  the  agricultural  debt.   Further
organisation  and  management  appears  to  be  in  place   concerning   the
administration of such moneys.

It is important that transparency is present to  ensure  the  effective  and
efficient management of these funds  that  shall  be  convened  via  regular
auditing and reporting on the account. The MF suggests an  occasional  check
by an independent body to ensure  that  this  is  maintained  and  correctly
instituted. Not only would this be a mechanism to avoid corruption,  but  it
would also ensure the success of this programme.

The MF supports sustainable development  in  all  industries  and  sees  the
provision to utilise these  funds  for  agricultural  debt  as  a  means  to
accomplish this. The advancement of the industry would be to  the  advantage
of all, as would proper management.

The Bill  appears  to  institute  good  management  for  the  collection  of
agricultural debt, and certainly makes allowance for the industry  via  this
management.
The MF supports the Agricultural Debt Management Bill. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, there is a well-known bumper sticker  one  often
sees on the bakkies of farmers that go: ``My hart is in die boerdery  en  my
`what-you-may-call-it' is in die skuld''. [My heart is  in  farming  but  my
`what-you-may-call-it' is  in  debt.]  This  is  more  than  a  mere  bumper
sticker. It reflects the situation of most of the farmers in South Africa.

Die skuld-bate verhouding in kommersiële landbou is tans baie  ongesond.  'n
Groot deel daarvan is buite die beheer van die boer.  Oneweredige  eskalasie
van pryse dra grootliks daartoe by. In 1974 kon jy 'n tenk van 2  200  liter
diesel koop vir die prys van een ton mielies. Vandag moet 'n  boer  agt  ton
verkoop om sy tenk vol te maak.

Onbillike  kompetisie  met  regeringsgesubsideerde   produkte   vanuit   die
buiteland en natuurrampe soos siektes, vloede, droogtes  en  veldbrande  het
die situasie in die jongste tyd verder vererger. (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The debt-asset ratio in commercial farming is currently very  unhealthy.  A
great part thereof is beyond the farmer's  control.  Unequal  escalation  of
prices contributes largely to this. In 1974 one could buy 2  200  litres  of
diesel for the price of one ton of maize. Today a  farmer  must  sell  eight
tons in order to buy this amount of diesel.

Unfair  competition  with  government-subsidised   products   from   foreign
countries and natural disasters like diseases,  floods,  droughts  and  veld
fires have aggravated the situation recently.]

The AEB realises  that  the  termination  of  the  credit  function  of  the
Agricultural Credit Board could have created a  vacuum  with  respect  to  a
legislative framework for debt collection. It is also clear  to  us  that  a
framework which can facilitate the integrated management  of  the  financing
instruments of the Department of Agriculture is  now  needed.  Against  this
background, the AEB supports this Bill.

But a mere administrative arrangement is not enough. We  must  go  one  step
further and look at arrangements or perhaps new legislation  that  can  help
commercial farmers stay in production without a  debt  load  that  makes  it
impossible to continue farming in a productive way.

The paramount role commercial farmers are playing in  the  stabilisation  of
the whole country cannot be overemphasised. They play a vital  role  in  the
rural economy. A healthy  commercial  agricultural  sector  is  one  of  the
biggest weapons against unemployment.

Dit is absoluut noodsaaklik om bestaande boere op hul plase  te  hou  en  om
met billike finansiering te help om geleenthede vir nuwe boere te skep.

Daarom pleit ons dat fondse wat onder  hierdie  nuwe  wet  gewin  sal  word,
primêr aangewend sal word om billike finansiering vir die  kommersiële  boer
daar  te  stel,  met  'n  spesifieke  voorkeur  aan  boere  wat  deur  groot
natuurrampe getref is en nuwe opkomende boere.

Die AEB steun hierdie wetsontwerp en vertrou dat dit vir hierdie  doeleindes
aangewend sal word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It is absolutely essential to keep existing farmers on their farms  and  to
assist with reasonable  financing  to  help  create  opportunities  for  new
farmers.

That is why we are appealing for new funds that will be gained by  this  new
legislation to be applied primarily to establish  reasonable  financing  for
commercial farmers, with  farmers  that  were  hit  by  large-scale  natural
disasters and new emerging farmers receiving preference.

The AEB supports this Bill and trusts that  it  will  be  applied  to  these
ends.]

Mr M A MAPHALALA: Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the ANC to support  the
Bill. I support the Bill  for  two  main  reasons.  The  first  is  that  it
provides a better mechanism of administering the  collection  of  debts  and
credits. Secondly, I support the Bill because of what  other  speakers  have
already mentioned. For the first time in the history of  this  country  this
Bill closes the gap between blacks generally, and  Africans  in  particular,
and other races in this country.

One issue that is perhaps clear to us is the reflection of members who  have
participated in the portfolio committee. If  one  listened  very  carefully,
those who have been  active  in  this  portfolio  committee  understood  the
explanation and objectives of this Bill and, as a result, all of  them  gave
their support.

Few members who spoke here  raised  questions  that  were  dealt  with,  but
unfortunately some members did not participate in  the  portfolio  committee
deliberations. The questions that they posed were addressed and we  received
satisfactory responses. We further satisfied ourselves by interrogating  the
Bill itself.

The hon Dr Van Niekerk, a frequent participant in the committee, raised  the
issue of land reforms. There are two main activities that are to take  place
in this country. A conference will be held next month and I am sure that  if
time allowed the Minister would have addressed this issue.  This  conference
will deal precisely with the  question  of  land  reform  and  appropriately
address the issue of Africans who did not have access to land.

This question can be addressed by way of debt and credit  but  this  is  not
adequate. The issue  here  is  whether  land  is  available  for  people  to
utilise, enabling them  to  access  the  finances  that  are  provided.  The
Government is addressing this issue. I want to inform the Minister  and  the
director-general  that  in  terms  of  this  Government's  and  Parliament's
policy, which is to provide a better life  for  all,  they  are  on  course.
[Interjections.] [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: A better life for the ANC Government! That  is  what  you  are
about all the time. What about the other people?

Mr M A MAPHALALA: We discussed issues with  the  hon  Ditshetelo  out  there
very well and we agreed that he should consider joining the ANC. One of  the
things  that  he  should  probably  do  before  he  addresses  a   Bill   or
legislation, is to understand the provisions in that legislation. This  Bill
precisely addresses the issue  of  the  appropriation  of  these  funds.  It
states that Parliament shall appropriate these funds and  allocate  them  on
the basis of a plan which is provided by  the  department.  This  plan  will
tell us where this money is  going  to  be  utilised.  These  questions  are
addressed and the hon member's concerns are dealt with.  The  member  should
join us in fully supporting this Bill without any doubts. [Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Why don't you join the UCDP? [Laughter.]

Mr M A MAPHALALA: Mr Groenewald raised the issue of writing off  debts.  One
of the reasons I support this Bill is because it provides a very  clean  and
neat mechanism for administering the funds. We will not support an  anarchic
situation of writing off debts. The Bill  does  stipulate  exactly  at  what
stage and under which conditions one writes  off  debts.  This  question  is
also addressed. Therefore, I want to appeal to  the  House  that  this  Bill
should follow the route which the participants in the committee took,  where
members gave their support, because we  believe  it  addresses  the  current
issues we face in this country. [Applause.]

[The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, I  hope  that
interpreters are available because I made a note that I  would  be  replying
in my mother tongue and my father tongue, which are Swati and Zulu.

Regarding the speech delivered by members  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Agriculture and Land Affairs, it was clear that they agreed  as  people  who
have  been  looking  at  this  Bill.  I  have   noticed   that   there   are
recommendations made by members of the committee even though there  is  this
agreement. It is also important to mention that the recommendations are  not
just about  this  Bill  only,  they  are  also  about  how  we  can  develop
agriculture, especially small farmers. It is about how we as the  Government
can support agriculture so that farmers,  as  they  have  the  challenge  of
supplying us with food, can do that and not carry huge debts.

I would like to thank the chairperson of the committee for the way he  spoke
here. It became clear that he too believes that this Bill is part  of  those
things that we are trying to change in the agricultural  sector.  We  should
note that we are going to present another  Bill  here.  The  committee  will
look at it soon. The Bill will be about changing  the  system  of  the  Land
Bank.]

Legislation will be coming before this House which in part  deals  with  the
issues of  agricultural  finance  and  matters  that  need  to  be  reviewed
regarding the  Land  and  Agricultural  Development  Bank.  Clearly,  as  we
examine this legislation we all need to ask ourselves if there is room or  a
lacuna that is left to deal with some  of  the  challenges  of  agricultural
development in this country and, if so, what needs to be done.

If  some  of  these  things  cannot  be  done  in  terms  of  the  Land  and
Agricultural Development Bank Act, what would be the  new  instruments  that
will be required? These are some of the matters that hon members raised.  We
might  have  to  review  some  of  the  processes   as   we   proceed   with
implementation and determine whether or not new instruments have to  be  put
in place. But, all in all, members supported the proposed Bill that we  have
presented to this House.

Ngitsandza  kuphindze  ngisho  kutsi  lendzaba  yesikweledi  lebekwe  nguMnu
Groenewald  nakitsi  ibalulekile  kakhulu.  Ngiyakuvisisa   kutsi   kufanele
akhulume kanjalo ngobe ulilunga lePhalamende nje ngobe umelele  labo  bantfu
labamkhetsa,   ikakhulu   labo   labavelana   nemgomo   wenhlangano   yakhe.
Akungikhatsati-ke mine kutsi uvele wasukuma lapha watsi akanawukhuluma  yena
ngalomTsetfo, kutsi yebo uyawuva, kodvwa ufuna nje kutsi  sicedze  sikweledi
nome ngabe kwente njani, sikhohlwe kutsi kukhona lokonakele.

Maye bekungaba mnandzi kube besingakhona kukwenta  loko!  Bekungaba  mnandzi
futsi  kube  besingakwenta   loko   futsi   sikwente   kubo   bonke   bantfu
labanetikweledi. Mhlawumbe lesikweledi lesikhuluma ngaso  lamuhla  sikweledi
salabamhlophe. Kodvwa-ke bantfu lababuya etindzaweni  letifana  nemaphakatsi
yeKwaZulu-Natal, eNorth West,  e-Eastern  Cape  kanye  nakuletinye  tindzawo
bayati  kutsi  nebantfu  labamnyama   kunesikweledi   labanaso   labasitfola
kuletinhlangano  tekutfutfukisa.   Nalapho   sitsi   asisebentise   umtsetfo
lofanako wekutsi umuntfu lonesikweledi akasibhadale kuHulumende.

Kodvwa sibuye sitsi kunendlela  lebekwe  nguloMtsetfo  wetetimali,  i-Public
Finance Management Act, lechazako kutsi nangabe  sifuna  kubolekisa  ngemali
yini lesiyibukako. Kwekucala lesikubukako kutsi lomuntfu lona  utakuba  nayo
yini  indlela  yekusibhadala  lesikwekedi,  nekutsi   uhleti   angasibhadali
lesikweledi nje uyatsandza yini nome kukhona tinkinga lanato.

Kwesibili sibuka kutsi nasilandza lesikweledi ingabe sitawuzuza  yini  kumbe
sitawulahlekelwa   yimali   ngekulandzelana   nalabotiki   kanye    nabozuka
lesikweledwa bona. Konkhe loko siyaye sikubuke bese-ke  ekugcineni  siyabuka
kutsi ingabe singenta njani.

Ngikhuluma nje kulomnyaka  lophelile  sesule  sikweledi  lesibalelwa  ku  R6
million. Ngako-ke ngitawucela kuMnu Groenewald  kutsi  akatjele  labomnakabo
kutsi ababhadale lemali. Nami ngayibhadala leyo  mali  naloku  ngangingesiye
umlimi  futsi  nebakitsi  bangazane  bayitfole,   kodvwa   labomnakabo   Mnu
Groenewald bona bahlomlile ngekuyitfola lemali. Namuhla-ke  sale  bayibuyisa
ngobe nami sengifuna kuniketa  laba  bendlu  lemnyama  labangazange  bakwati
kuyitfola lemali ngaphambilini. [Tandla.] (Translation of siSwati  paragraph
follows).

[I would like to reiterate the fact that the issue of  outstanding  debt  to
which Mr Groenewald has referred is very important to  us  as  well.  I  can
understand why he is saying the things he is  saying.  He  is  a  member  of
Parliament who was elected by and who represents people  who  identify  with
the policies of his party. The fact that he simply stood up  here  and  said
that he was not going to talk about this legislation does not bother  me  at
all. Although he understands why such legislation is necessary, he wants  us
to write off the outstanding debt no matter what and forget about  what  has
gone wrong.

How wonderful it would be if we could do just that! How wonderful  it  would
be to do that with all the people who have an outstanding debt. Perhaps  the
debt we are talking about here today is the debt of white  people.  However,
people who come from places such as the KwaZulu-Natal  Midlands,  the  North
West, the Eastern Cape and other places  know  that  black  people  have  an
outstanding   debt  too   which   they   incurred   from   the   development
corporations. In such cases, too, we need to apply the same  priciple,  that
a person who has an outstanding debt must pay such debt to the Government.

There is  a  method  which  has  been  established  by  the  Public  Finance
Management Act which explains what it is we have to look  at  when  we  give
out loans. The first thing we look at is whether such  a  person  will  have
the means to repay the debt, and if he or she is failing to pay,  is  he  or
she unwilling to do so or is he or she experiencing problems.  Secondly,  we
look at whether  recovering  the  outstanding  debt  will  be  a  worthwhile
exercise or whether we will lose more money trying to recover  insignificant
amounts of money. We look at all this and then decide what we should do.

Already, last year  we  wrote  off  an  outstanding  debt  amounting  to  R6
million. I would  therefore  like  to  ask  Mr  Groenewald  to  request  his
brothers to pay their outstanding debt. I paid that debt even  though  I  am
not a farmer and my family never benefited from the scheme. Mr  Groenewald's
brothers have benefited from it, therefore they need to pay it back so  that
I can give it to black people who  have  never  received  it  in  the  past.

                        NATIONAL PARKS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)
The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND  TOURISM:  Madam  Speaker,  it  is
with great pleasure that I stand before Members  today  to  present  a  Bill
which will  truly  aid  the  Government  in  fulfilling  its  constitutional
obligation as required in section 24 of the Constitution.

As part of its mandate to provide  public  access  to  nationally  protected
areas, SA National Parks also has a statutory mandate to maintain a  network
of tourist facilities  from  which  revenue,  allocated  to  carry  out  its
conservation  activities,  is  sourced.  At  present  the  land  area  under
protection in South  Africa  is  about  6%,  which  is  short  of  the  IUCM
recommended minimum of 10%.

While the Government is  financially  committed  to  assisting  SA  National
Parks with the acquisition of land for new parks and  the  consolidation  of
existing  ones,  available  resources  within  Government  will  always   be
severely limited. In this context of constrained governmental resources  the
role played by a number of conservation NGOs,  national  and  international,
as well as private individuals, has necessarily come to play a crucial  role
in assisting both SA  National  Parks  and  the  Government  to  fulfil  our
constitutional mandate to protect our environment -
  ... for the benefit of present and future  generations ...

The significance of these private contributions or donations should  not  be
underestimated. Since 1994  that  financial  assistance  has  subsidised  SA
National Parks' acquisition of five new  parks,  as  well  as  thousands  of
hectares of land which consolidate existing new parks such as the Addo,  the
Mountain Zebra, Karoo and Marekele national parks.

Currently SA National Parks is registered as an enterprise in terms  of  the
VAT Act. As a result, the board of SA National Parks has to pay VAT  on  any
consideration it receives in relation to its supply of goods  and  services.
The statutory definition of  consideration  includes  any  payment  for  the
supply of goods and services, whether in  money  or  otherwise  and  whether
voluntary or not.

Thus SA National Parks,  being  statutorily  considered  an  enterprise,  is
charged VAT on all its activities carried out  in  the  furtherance  of  its
aims  and  objectives  in  which  goods  or  services   are   supplied   for
consideration. Accordingly, special donations and sponsorships  received  by
SA National Parks are legally subject to VAT because they are regarded as  a
consideration and therefore subject to the VAT Act.

An opinion from the SA Revenue Service states  that  special  donations  and
sponsorships to SA National Parks would legally continue to  be  subject  to
VAT, because it does not qualify as  ``an  association  not  for  gain''  as
defined in the  VAT  Act.  In  the  interim,  and  on  condition  that  this
parliamentary process to amend the  National  Parks  Act  was  engaged,  the
Commissioner of Revenue recognised the anomalies that were  occurring  as  a
result of the application of  the  letter  of  the  law  and  exercised  his
statutory discretion, provided for  in  section  72  of  the  VAT  Act,  and
granted SA National Parks a tax exemption from the application  of  the  VAT
Act.

This concession gave SA National Parks the informal and de facto  status  of
an association not for gain. In doing so, the commissioner  highlighted  the
fact that, should this condition not be complied with, the  ruling  granting
SA National Parks the concession would  be  withdrawn  retrospectively.  The
above historical account serves  to  give  the  context  within  which  this
rational and legally necessary decision to amend the Act was taken.

Compliance with the relevant provision in the VAT  Act  will  mean  that  SA
National Parks must, upon  winding  up  or  liquidation,  transfer  all  its
remaining assets, after satisfaction  of  its  liabilities,  to  a  society,
association  or  organisation  which  has  similar  objects.  If  Parliament
approves this amendment to section 18 of the National  Parks  Act,  the  tax
effect will be that SA National Parks will legally not be  required  to  pay
VAT on its special donations and sponsorships.

This amendment will ensure that SA National Parks gets the full  benefit  of
the financial and in kind donations which, as I have already indicated,  are
crucial for both the management of SA National Parks and the acquisition  of
additional land. But, perhaps more importantly, in  the  face  of  intensive
competition for scarce governmental financial  assistance  it  is  important
that SA National Parks should not have to allocate its scarce cash  resource
to Government to be used for  purposes  other  than  that  intended  by  the
donor. [Applause.]

Ms G  L  MAHLANGU:  Madam  Speaker,  Minister  Moosa,  members,  ladies  and
gentlemen, on first sight of this amending Bill  the  words  of  our  former
President, Nelson Mandela,  at  the  launch  of  the  Kruger  National  Park
centenary celebrations on 26 March 1998 rang clearly in my ears. I quote  as
follows.


  If we are to succeed in fully realising the potential  of  ecotouriom  to
  contribute to  development,  it  will  be  by  embracing  the  spirit  of
  partnership that underlies all our  achievements  as  a  newly  liberated
  nation.


  A  new  generation  of  leaders  has  the  responsibility  for  enhancing
  conservation and public service standards. Theirs is the task of bringing
  together all stakeholders in a broad partnership.


  The private sector, whose generosity made  this  event  possible,  has  a
  major role to play, whether it be through the promotion of  conservation,
  direct assistance in the upliftment of communities neighbouring on parks,
  or as business  with  an  interest  in  the  sustainable  growth  of  the
  industry.

The financial statements of the SA National  Parks  speak  volumes  of  this
generosity by private benefactors, taking section 24 of our Constitution  to
heart and literally putting their money where their mouths  are,  in  order,
firstly, to protect the environment for the benefit of  present  and  future
generations through various measurers, amongst others preventing  ecological
degradation; secondly, to  promote  conservation;  and  thirdly,  to  secure
ecologically sustainable development and  use  of  natural  resources  while
promoting justifiable economic and social development.

This is the constitutionally entrenched right  of  every  citizen  of  South
Africa, to which private benefactors donated R16,1 million in the year  1999
to 2000, R9,1 million in the year 2000 to 2001, and R600 000 in the  current
year. It is a contribution of such significance and importance for the long-
term development and conservation of our biodiversity that a  whole  section
on finance and resources under  the  theme  ``Building  a  Secure  Financial
Future'' is being set aside and subjected to  extensive  discussion  at  the
Fifth World Parks Congress to be held in Durban in the year 2003. The  theme
of that congress ``Benefits without Boundaries'' could not  have  been  more
appropriate either as we debate in support of the National  Parks  Amendment
Bill today.

Established in 1976 through the National Parks Act, the  key  objectives  of
SA National Parks have not only been the protection and conservation of  our
biodiversity, but have also played an important role in  the  employment  of
people in local communities,  the  maximisation  of  possibilities  for  the
creation of employment in rural areas,  as  well  as  in  key  socioeconomic
areas in the regions within which they exist,  such  as  education,  health,
empowerment and many other sectors.

Whilst  the  ANC  recognises  that  the  establishment  and  maintenance  of
national parks are important and that these need to be  conserved,  it  also
recognises the integral part  they  play  in  national  development  through
tourism, job creation and education.

Before the advent of the current democratic dispensation  in  South  Africa,
nature conservation was used as an instrument of oppression. It  was  mainly
used as a means to maintain control of Africa's natural  resources,  firstly
against the indigenous African communities, and secondly amongst the  forces
of oppression as they sought to restrict natural resources for  the  benefit
of a few.

Since 1994, however, South Africa has embarked  on  a  path  of  sustainable
development, focusing  on  meeting  the  needs  of  the  current  generation
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their  needs.
Acknowledging that it is the poor that bear the burden of bad  environmental
practice, the ANC focused on transforming  the  management  of  our  natural
environment. Our commitment to sustainable development  has  enabled  us  to
adopt and implement a position in terms of which we  place  our  people  and
their  needs  on  the  forefront  of   conservation   to   serve   physical,
psychological, developmental, cultural and social interests equitably.

Underpinned  by  environmental   justice,   environmental   governance   and
biodiversity management, we recognise  that  a  prosperous,  environmentally
conscious nation depends on people who are in  harmonious  coexistence  with
the natural environment and derive lasting  benefit  from  the  conservation
and sustainable use of its rich biodiversity.

In this regard I wish to  applaud  the  proactive  approach  with  which  SA
National Parks approached this  predicament,  and  the  effective  and  bold
manner in which  it  embarked  on  future  public-private  partnerships,  as
illustrated by its commercialisation programme.

It is significant to note that the concessions for the restaurants,  lodges,
retail shops and picnic sites were designed in such  a  way  as  to  totally
eliminate and avoid corruption within the allocation of  these  concessions.
In the Kruger, Kgalagadi, Golden Gate and Addo parks,  lodges  were  put  up
for concession in a manner that was transparent and  widely  applauded.  The
construction of these lodges, by means of a building operator  and  transfer
system over 20 years, not only ensured that our crown jewels landed  in  the
hands of private  sector  companies,  but  vastly  revalued  the  properties
upwards to a figure of some R200 million.

Further key criteria  for  successful  bidding  were  the  demonstration  of
significant empowerment to the local communities,  the  demonstration  of  a
procurement  process,  shareholding  for  the  communities  in  future   and
affirmative action that ensures local communities will become  part  of  the
management of these operations in our parks.
It is for this reason that the ANC wishes to reward  SA  National  Parks  in
ways which would assist them  to  travel  the  hard  path  of  future  sound
financial administration with more ease, by recommending that  the  National
Parks Amendment Bill be passed in this House.

As we met last week as extremely proud  Southern  Africans  at  the  Greater
Limpopo Transfrontier Park, the largest conservation area in the  world,  an
awareness of the heavy  responsibility  that  rests  on  our  shoulders  was
underlined, a  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the  legal  and  regulatory
framework  within  which  the  institutions  facilitating  this   remarkable
achievement operate is in tandem with our vision for transparent,  efficient
and effective governance. The adoption of the National Parks Amendment  Bill
therefore makes not only administrative sense, but lies at the heart of  the
economic principles driving the prosperity of our national parks.

With the  legacy  and  physical  evidence  of  underdevelopment  manifesting
itself all around us, no argument can be  made  that  justifies  nondelivery
through slow transformation of the  bureaucratic  framework  that  sets  the
playing field for institutions such as the SA National Parks that we  employ
ultimately to deliver on the rightful demands of citizens who  entrusted  us
with the realisation of their aspirations during the last two elections.

As mentioned in the state of the nation address  by  the  President  earlier
this year, we have identified tourism as requiring special  attention  owing
to its potential to contribute significantly to  the  objectives  of  higher
growth rates and job creation. This Bill will ensure that  these  objectives
are  met  and  that  moneys  made  available  to  the  national   parks   by
beneficiaries can be utilised and invested sensibly and  without  delay,  to
improve current facilities and further enhance the position of  SA  National
Parks as prime tourist destinations within South Africa.

I wish to thank the Commissioner of the South African  Revenue  Service  for
his discretion with regard  to  this  matter  during  the  past  two  years,
allowing a period in which SA National Parks did not  have  to  pay  VAT  on
these donations and sponsorships. I believe that this is indicative  of  the
sense of commitment  and  responsibility  that  is  being  displayed  within
Government towards ensuring the preservation of our national  treasures  for
the benefit of all South Africans and our future generations.
Re a loboga, Tona. [Thank you, Minister.] [Applause.]

Mr E K MOORCROFT: Madam Speaker, it gives me pleasure to follow on  the  hon
Gwen Mahlangu who dealt with  this  Bill  in  the  committee  in  her  usual
efficient and pleasant way.

The DP will be supporting this Bill  and  we  do  so  because  we  not  only
believe it to be  appropriate,  but  also  because  we  are  aware  that  SA
National Parks is experiencing financial difficulties at the  present  time.
The adoption of the Bill will, in some measure, assist SA National Parks  in
facing and, hopefully, in overcoming these difficulties.

For those of us who appreciate the importance of the role which SA  National
Parks  plays  in  our  national  and  international  tourist  industry,  the
knowledge that it is experiencing financial problems is cause  for  concern.
This has special reference to our flagship national park,  the  Kruger.  Not
only is the Kruger our best loved and most visited park, but it  is  also  a
brand name in the international tourist industry.

Any damage done to the good name and reputation of the Kruger National  Park
will deal a severe body blow to our entire tourist industry. Indeed,  damage
done to any of our parks will also  damage  our  precious  natural  heritage
which, in terms of our commitment to the conservation of  biodiversity,  has
its own special importance.

The hon the Minister is,  of  course,  aware  of  these  concerns.  He  will
appreciate  the  desire  of  all  South  Africans  that  these  concerns  be
addressed. We then see this Bill in that light and we approach it as such.

While the Bill seeks to relieve SA National Parks of making VAT payments  on
gifts and donations, thereby improving its overall cash flow,  the  hon  the
Minister's response to certain related questions which arise  will  be  much
appreciated. These are the  following.  Firstly,  there  are  concerns  that
since the state reduced its direct subsidisation of SA National Parks,  that
organisation has found it increasingly difficult to make ends  meet  and  to
maintain the high standards of  excellence  for  which  it  was  universally
famous.

Put another way, there is concern that if SA National  Parks  has  to  spend
more on the maintenance of standards than revenue received  makes  possible,
then either standards will suffer or SA National Parks will go  deeper  into
debt. Obviously, neither alternative is desirable.  This  problem  has  many
ramifications and my colleague the hon Le Roux will be dealing with some  of
them later.

The second  concern  involves  the  sale  of  property  or  property  rights
belonging to SA National Parks to private individuals  or  companies.  These
sales involve mainly accommodation,  catering  and  trading.  The  rationale
behind  this  is  that   by   relieving   SA   National   Parks   of   these
responsibilities, they will be able to get on with what they do best,  which
is the conservation  of  our  wildlife  resources,  obviously  also  raising
revenue at the same time.

While we in these benches support, in principle,  what  may  be  called  the
privatisation of the hospitality and trading industries  in  the  parks,  we
would, at the same time, like the assurance from the hon the  Minister  that
money so raised will not be used simply to balance the deficit in the  books
caused by the problems experienced with revenue flows.

If this is the case, then it could be likened to the selling of  the  family
silver, simply to get SA National Parks  out  of  debt.  If,  however,  this
money is to be used for the creative development of SA  National  Parks  and
the  extension  of  exciting  projects  such  as   the   creation   of   the
transfrontier  peace  parks,  then  we  would  continue  to   support   this
privatisation programme with enthusiasm. Perhaps the hon the Minister  would
find time in his reply to deal with those two topics.

In closing, the DP supports any reasonable measures with SA  National  Parks
that the hon the Minister might take to improve the  financial  position  of
SA National Parks. We do so because  we  are  fully  aware  of  SA  National
Parks' importance in the conservation of our unique and invaluable  national
heritage, and in the development and expansion of our most exciting  growing
industry, which is tourism. We will be supporting this Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs L R  MBUYAZI:  Madam  Speaker,  the  IFP  supports  the  National  Parks
Amendment Bill. We have always  agreed  in  Parliament  that  the  tax  base
should be extended, and that it should never be eroded. In recent years  the
Sars has succeeded in bringing more people  into  tax  nets.  The  Sars  has
always stepped up its efforts to make sure that all enterprises pay VAT.  SA
National Parks is also registered  as  an  enterprise,  although  it  is  an
enterprise of a very different kind. It is an enterprise that is devoted  to
a public benefit activity.

The  national  parks  of  South  Africa  are  unique  areas  set  aside  for
conservation and for the protection of our very  special  flora,  fauna  and
biosphere. Although Government puts money into these great treasures of  our
land, that money is never enough. We need donations. The  sheer  quality  of
national parks encourage people to think about making donations. After  all,
our national parks are amongst the  best  in  the  world.  The  problem  for
donors was  the  14%  deduction  for  VAT.  Clearly,  as  a  public  benefit
activity, the national parks qualify to be exempted from VAT when  donations
are received. This is what is now being  done.  With  the  removal  of  this
obstacle, the national parks will be able to  keep  all  of  the  donations.
This is a very positive development. All over the world  natural  sites  are
under pressure. Development and urban spread have left very little land  for
conservation.

As custodians of the earth which must be inherited by our children, we  need
to take care and preserve flora and provide space for the wild  animals  and
creatures of our land. We need to do much more in this area for the sake  of
future generations. When we  preserve  our  biosphere,  conserve  our  plant
species, and protect  our  animals,  we  provide  both  space  and  economic
opportunity for the future. Nations that conserve  will  prosper  and  those
that dispose their natural areas will suffer hardship.

The National Parks Amendment Bill shows everyone our enormous commitment  to
the great national parks in South Africa. Can I now call on  donors  to  put
their hands deep into their pockets, so that our national parks can  prosper
and be great legacies for the future? Biodiversity issues are  a  matter  of
local, national, regional and global  concern.  And  with  the  majority  of
people in South Africa being poor, national  parks  will  certainly  promote
economic development whilst addressing poverty and sustainable livelihood.

Lastly, I would also like to congratulate the Minister who  has  established
the  third  peace  park  following  the  signing  of   the   memorandum   of
understanding between South Africa  and  Lesotho  to  conserve  the  Maluti-
Drakensberg mountains. This was to restore the pride  of  a  mountain  range
divided by decades of colonialism.  The  Maluti-Drakensberg  Peace  Park  is
described as an integrative  programme  that  includes  the  world  heritage
site. South  Africa's  Ukhahlamba-Drakensberg  conservation  area  that  was
inscribed on Unesco's World Heritage list in December and as a tourism  base
spatial development initiative, is the first  of  its  kind  in  the  world.
[Applause.]

Mnr J W LE ROUX: Mev die Speaker, die ontwikkeling en  uitbreiding  van  ons
parke word tot 'n baie groot mate bevorder deur  skenkings,  beide  plaaslik
en internasionaal. Dit sal die Parkeraad dus finansieel help om nie  BTW  op
skenkings te betaal nie en  dit  sal  die  skenkers  help  as  skenkings  en
donasies van belasting afgetrek  kan  word.  Die  DA  ondersteun  graag  die
wysigingswetsontwerp wat bogenoemde  moontlik  maak.  Natuurbewaring  geniet
tans wêreldwyd geweldige belangstelling. As Suid-Afrika gesien kan  word  as
die wêreldleier op hierdie gebied, sal  dit  ons  aansien  en  beeld  as  'n
suksesland baie versterk.

Daar is beslis baie meer as net  bewaring  op  die  spel.  Die  uiteindelike
sukses vir  Suid-Afrika  en  Suidelike  Afrika  sal  bepaal  word  deur  ons
buitelandse  beeld.  'n  Gunstige  beeld  lok  belangstelling  en  toerisme-
investering, en ekonomiese voorspoed volg. Suid-Afrika kan  trots  wees  dat
die CNN-nuusprogram reeds 'n  uiters  gunstige  berig  oor  die  vredesparke
gebeeldsend het, en dít terwyl die oorlog teen terreur alles oorheers.

Afrikapessimisme is die grootste  struikelblok  op  die  pad  na  voorspoed.
Suksesse    soos    die     vredesparkontwikkeling     en     baie     ander
natuurbewaringsaksies kan grootliks bydra  tot  die  skep  van  'n  gunstige
beeld. Leiers van die formaat van dr Anton Rupert  en  talle  ander  verdien
net die grootste agting vir wat hulle in dié verband verrig het. Feitlik  al
die grootste en mees respekteerde sakereuse steun reeds die  bewaringsaksies
in Suid-Afrika. Dit is dus ontstellend dat groot besighede in sekere  kringe
verdag gemaak word. Minister Moosa en sy amptenare verdien almal  se  steun.
Die insig en toewyding waarmee hulle  natuurbewaringsake  bestuur  en  veral
die sukses van vredesparke en privatisering is van groot  belang  vir  Suid-
Afrika. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J W LE ROUX: Madam Speaker, the development and expansion of  our  parks
are promoted  to  a  very  great  extent  by  donations,  both  locally  and
internationally. It would therefore help the Parks Board financially not  to
have to pay VAT on donations and it  would  help  the  donors  if  donations
could be deducted  from  tax.  The  DA  takes  pleasure  in  supporting  the
statutory amendment which makes this  possible.  Nature  conservation  is  a
matter of tremendous concern all over the world  at  the  moment.  If  South
Africa could be seen as the world leader in this  field,  it  would  greatly
enhance our prestige and image as a successful country.

Obviously a lot more than merely conservation  is  at  stake.  The  ultimate
success of South Africa and Southern Africa will be determined by our  image
abroad. A favourable image attracts interest and investment in tourism,  and
economic prosperity follows. South Africa can take pride in  the  fact  that
the CNN news programme has already televised a  very  favourable  report  on
the peace parks, and this at a time when everything is dominated by the  war
against terrorism.

Afro-pessimism is the biggest stumbling block on  the  road  to  prosperity.
Successes such as the peace park development can contribute a great deal  to
the creation of a favourable image. Leaders  of  the  calibre  of  Dr  Anton
Rupert and many others deserve only the greatest respect for what they  have
done in  this  regard.  Practically  all  the  largest  and  most  respected
business grants are already supporting the  conservation  actions  in  South
Africa. It is therefore alarming that suspicion is  being  thrown  on  large
businesses in certain quarters. Minister Moosa  and  his  officials  deserve
everyone's support. The  insight  and  dedication  with  which  they  manage
nature conservation affairs and especially the success of  peace  parks  and
privatisation are of great importance to South Africa.]

There are two issues that I would like to mention. The current dominance  of
the peace parks and success of the national parks must not detract from  the
importance of the parks in the southern regions of the country. The  Eastern
Cape especially needs much more attention.

It is important that the Garden Route, Tsitsikamma  Storms  River,  Baviaans
Addo Park  and  Transkei  Wild  Coast  get  our  Minister's  attention.  The
upgrading and  consolidation  of  these  large  and  magnificent  parks  and
wilderness areas will give the Eastern Cape a much-needed boost.

Secondly, we must get much more support from  the  Treasury.  We  have  this
unique potential to create enormous parks  in  wilderness  areas  second  to
none in the world. We can create a tourist  destination  that  will  capture
the imagination of all international travellers. Yet we  rely  on  hand-outs
from  big  business  and  concerned  world  nature  lovers.  We   have   the
infrastructure, the expertise and the will to succeed. All we  need  is  the
money. If we can  convince  Government  to  cut  as  little  as  5%  on  the
ridiculous arms deal and if we can  use  these  savings  to  promote  nature
conservation, we will change the face of South Africa. In this  way  we  can
effectively contribute to the African Recovery Plan.

Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker, the National Parks Amendment  Bill  seeks  to
amend the National Parks Act of 1976, in order to bring  SA  National  Parks
within the ambit of the definition of ``association not for gain''.  Section
18 of the National Parks Act of 1976  is  amended  by  the  insertion  after
subsection (2) of the following subsection:


     (2A) Upon the winding-up or liquidation of the board it shall donate or
     transfer  its  remaining  assets,  after  the   satisfaction   of   its
     liabilities, to some other society, association  or  organisation  with
     objects similar to its own.

On 27  July  2001,  the  Minister  of  Finance  did  not  include  the  core
activities of  SA  National  Parks,  namely  conservation,  environment  and
animal welfare, when he listed certain activities needed for  the  interests
and wellbeing of the general public.

The intended amendment, therefore, brings into line  the  activities  of  SA
National Parks with those listed by the Minister of Finance. Thus, by  means
of this amendment, the national parks fall into the fold of  the  definition
of associations not for gain and will be exempted from VAT.

The deletion of clause 1.3 of the memorandum on the objects of the  Bill  is
of no consequence to the Bill. The UDM supports the amendment Bill.

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, may we, at  the  outset,  express
our sympathies with the families of the 19 SA National Parks  employees  who
lost their lives in the runaway  fire  at  the  Kruger  National  Park  last
month. We pray that our Lord will comfort them in their loss.  And,  may  we
also enquire from the Minister as to when we can expect the results  of  the
Commission of Inquiry into that event.

SA National Parks is a public entity whose mission is to acquire and  manage
a  system  of  national  parks  that  represents  the  indigenous  wildlife,
vegetation, landscapes and significant cultural assets of South  Africa  for
the pride and benefit of the nation.

It manages a  system  of  national  parks  that  is  representative  of  the
country's important ecosystems and unique  natural  features.  As  has  been
pointed out by other speakers, SA National Parks is also a victim of  severe
financial and budgetary constraints.

In view of the important function it has in protecting and safeguarding  our
natural heritage, it is crucial that it qualifies de jure and  not  only  de
facto for tax exemptions where possible. For this reason the  ACDP  supports
this amendment that seeks to avoid making  SA  National  Parks  pay  VAT  on
donations  and  sponsorships  by  bringing  it  within  the  ambit  of   the
definition of association not for gain in the VAT Act.

During discussions in the portfolio  committee,  the  possibility  was  also
mooted that persons donating funds to SA National Parks should  be  given  a
tax deduction for the amounts so donated. We were advised that this was  not
at present permissible, but we  trust  that  this  matter  will  be  further
investigated and that the activities of SA National  Parks  may  be  brought
under the public benefit activities as contemplated in sections  18  and  30
of the Income Tax Act.

In  conclusion,  we  trust  that  this  amendment  will  contribute  to  the
successful commercialisation programme of the national  parks  and  wish  to
thank our chairperson, Gwendoline Mahlangu, for her able manner  in  dealing
with this amending Bill. [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mev die Speaker, die Wysigingswetsontwerp op Nasionale  Parke
vandag voor ons is 'n baie kort en eenvoudige wetsontwerp. Die feit van  die
saak is dat, as mens kyk na die jaarboek, dan word daar in die afdeling  wat
handel   oor   toerisme   gedeeltes   gehanteer   rondom   die   tien    top
toeristebestemmings in  Suid-Afrika.  Een  van  hierdie  attraksies  is  die
Krugerpark, wat internasionaal bekend is en dien as die vlagskip  van  Suid-
Afrika se nasionale parke.

Toerisme kan nooit oorbeklemtoon word as een van  die  belangrikste  aspekte
in terme van buitelandse valutaverdiening om te kan optree as 'n  instrument
om Suid-Afrika te bemark nie. Daar  is  min  mense  internasionaal  wat  nie
bekend is met ons nasionale parke nie. Enigiets wat 'n  probleem  veroorsaak
in terme van ons nasionale parke is vir ons 'n bekommernis en  ons  wil  die
Minister vra om daarna te kyk. Die VF is bekommerd  oor  die  hantering  van
sekere personeelaangeleenthede by sommige van die nasionale parke.

Die doel van hierdie wetsontwerp word baie duidelik uiteengesit, naamlik  om
Suid-Afrika se  Nasionale  Parke  binne  die  trefwydte  te  bring  van  die
omskrywing van 'n ``vereniging sonder  winsoogmerk'',  soos  vervat  in  die
artikel oor belasting op toegevoegde waarde. Die effek is doodeenvoudig  dat
ons nasionale parke in die toekoms nie langer BTW sal  betaal  op  skenkings
en borgskappe nie. Dit is 'n baie positiewe benadering  en  behoort  gesteun
te word. Daardeur sal  die  geweldige  finansiële  druk  wat  op  die  parke
bestaan, verlig word en sal dit moontlik wees om hierdie parke en  die  hele
kommersialiseringsproses verder uit te br+ei, wat ook baie  positief  is  en
ons sal dit steun.

Die VF sal baie graag hierdie wetsontwerp steun en ons  sal  enige  maatreël
steun wat ons toerismebedryf verder kan  uitbou.  Hierdie  is  'n  positiewe
manier om dit te doen en ons steun  dit  graag.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, the National Parks Amendment Bill  before  us
today is a very concise  and  elementary  Bill.  In  fact,  looking  at  the
yearbook, the part that deals with trade and tourism  contains  sections  on
the top ten tourist destinations in South Africa. One of  these  attractions
is the Kruger National Park, which is well known internationally  and  which
serves as the flagship of South Africa's national parks.

Tourism can never be overestimated as one of the most important  aspects  in
terms of foreign exchange  earnings,  having  the  capacity  to  act  as  an
instrument through which South Africa can be marketed. Internationally,  few
people are not familiar with our national parks. If anything were  to  cause
a problem in terms of our national parks, we would  become  concerned  about
this and would like to  ask  the  Minister  to  look  into  it.  The  FF  is
concerned about the way in which certain staff matters are being dealt  with
at some of the national parks.

The aim of this Bill has been set out very clearly, namely  to  bring  South
Africa's  National  Parks  within  the  scope  of  the  definition   of   an
``association not for gain'', as contained in the section about  value-added
tax. The effect is simply that in future our national parks will  no  longer
be paying VAT on  donations  and  sponsorships.  This  is  a  very  positive
approach which should be supported.  In  this  way  the  enormous  financial
pressure upon the parks will be  alleviated  and  it  will  be  possible  to
extend the parks and the whole process of commercialisation, which  is  also
a very positive aspect that we will support.

The FF would really like to support  this  Bill,  as  we  will  support  any
measure aimed at further enhancing the tourism industry. This is a  positive
way of doing so and we gladly support it.]

Mr J D ARENDSE: Madam Speaker, one could  easily  be  fooled  into  thinking
that this Bill is merely about a minor technical amendment. Anyone would  be
forgiven for thinking that there is not much more to it than meets the  eye.


At closer scrutiny,  and  in  the  context  of  the  ongoing  transformation
process in our society, it is revealed that  the  National  Parks  Amendment
Bill allows our  people  to  participate  more  freely  in  the  upkeep  and
conservation of our national parks on a monetary level.

Two weeks ago I walked into a shop where the headlines of the Sunday  papers
screamed out at the world: ``Miracle In  Africa!''  Being  an  African,  and
committed to the resuscitation  of  the  African  continent  to  its  former
glory, this article naturally interested me. The  article,  of  course,  was
about the conservation agreement reached between South Africa, Zimbabwe  and
Mozambique. This agreement was probably the most tangible  step  ever  taken
by African governments in pursuit of the dream of  an  African  Renaissance,
where governments agree, of their own volition,  to  collapse  the  physical
boundaries that divide them, and to give birth to the  world's  largest  and
most ambitious conservation project.

The Minister of Environmental Affairs and  Tourism,  the  hon  Valli  Moosa,
said it best when he called it ``truly the  greatest  animal  kingdom''.  He
said that people would come from all over the continent and  world  to  feel
the nurturing touch of mother Africa, for a taste of Eden, for the  pristine
bush and wide-open spaces to satisfy a primordial longing.

This historic and  pioneering  initiative  is  not  only  a  celebration  of
democracy and regional stability, but also a celebration of  the  entrenched
peace between South Africa and  its  neighbours.  This,  in  line  with  the
amendment that the Bill  before  the  House  proposes,  can  only  serve  to
strengthen the hand of our Government.

When we pass this Bill today, and we will,  it  will  allow  our  people  to
contribute directly to the conservation of wildlife and some of  our  floral
beauty occurring in particular areas. It enables people  to  make  donations
or offer sponsorships, without paying  more,  equivalent  to  the  VAT  from
which SA National Parks will now be exempted. Certainly,  this  will  assist
our  national  parks  in  accessing  more  funds   through   donations   and
sponsorships.  It  will  not  only  attract   local   sponsors,   but   also
international ones.

So, when we pass this  Bill  this  afternoon,  Parliament  will  assist  the
people it serves to make more generous contributions to  conservation  as  a
whole. All of this is in addition to the  contribution  that  Government  is
making with its voluntary forfeiture  of  the  VAT  on  such  donations  and
sponsorships.

We have risen in support  of  this  Bill  today  not  only  because  of  the
amendments it proposes to the principal Act,  but  because  of  /the  bigger
picture of transformation, cross-border development  and  conservation;  and
because of the commitment of our Government and  other  African  governments
to marketing Africa as a top destination in the world tourism market.

We must congratulate the Minister for achieving these  noble  objectives  in
what must have been an arduous process. The  Minister,  in  his  interaction
with his Zimbabwean and Mozambican counterparts, should encourage a  similar
mechanism for the people of Zimbabwe and Mozambique so that  they  can  also
contribute the way we do; but more importantly, so that  they  can  own  the
initiative in the same way South Africans do.

After the miracle of 1994, we must remind  ourselves  of  the  thousands  of
little miracles that take place in Africa every day. I love  Africa,  and  I
love being an African. [Applause.]
Mr  I  S  MFUNDISI:  Chairperson  and  colleagues,  SA  National  Parks   is
registered as an enterprise for value-added tax,  and  this  results  in  SA
National Parks having to pay VAT on any consideration received,  in  respect
of goods or services it provides.

This Bill seeks to turn SA National Parks into an association not for  gain,
as provided for by the value-added tax Act of  1991.  There  are  Samaritans
out there who wish to make donations to the  SA  National  Parks,  and  this
Bill seeks to ensure that each cent so donated should  benefit  SA  National
Parks.

The merger will also assist in  making  National  Parks  financially  sound,
because donations and sponsorships so received will be for the sole  use  of
SA National Parks. Revenues for SA National Parks  will  be  independent  of
the  state,  to  allow  the  parks  to  run  their  own  affairs  like  real
businesses,   devoid   of   all   bureaucracy   that   characterises   state
institutions.

Whilst supporting the Bill, we should caution, however,  that  all  revenues
so received should be well accounted for by SA National Parks. Employees  of
SA National Parks should not be allowed to turn  into  fat  cats  on  moneys
meant to benefit the national parks.

The UCDP supports the Bill.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Mr Chairman, the PAC supports the National  Parks  Amendment
Bill.

Its purpose is to amend the National Parks Act, 1976. This is  to  bring  SA
National Parks within the ambit of  the  definition  ``association  not  for
gain'', contained in section 1 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1991.

Section 18 of the National Parks Act, 1976,  is  amended  by  the  insertion
after subsection (2) of the following subsection:


  2(A) Upon the winding-up or liquidation of the board it shall  donate  or
  transfer its remaining assets, after the satisfaction of its liabilities,
  to some other society, association or organisation with  objects  similar
  to its own.

The Bill seems to be the type which must be dealt with  in  accordance  with
the  procedure  established  in  section  75  of  the  Constitution.  It  is
important for me, on behalf of the PAC of Azania, to mention  that  national
parks are an important heritage. They are places where our wild animals  are
kept as well as where our natural vegetation is preserved.

Natural parks are the source of our wealth. They must be well looked  after.
They must be places that are for enjoyment by the  poor  and  by  the  rich.
Access to them must be affordable. This was not the case in  the  past,  and
there is no sign that there is a change to this now.

The other point which is of concern to the PAC, is  love  for  animals  more
than love for people. We all must love animals,  but  we  must  love  people
more than animals. It is not right to give more land  for  animal  use  when
people have no homes and live in places  unsuitable  for  human  habitation,
and their life expectancy on this planet is shortened as  a  result  of  the
unhealthy conditions in which they live.

The PAC trusts that the land distribution will benefit our  national  parks,
but equally enable our people to live dignified lives, in  dignified  homes,
with more land and more means to acquire  education  and  technical  skills.
[Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, national parks throughout  South  Africa  have
been deemed not only a major tourist magnet and a home to many of our  flora
and fauna, but have been complimented  significantly  on  their  beauty  and
content  as  well.  Even  the  Government  itself  has  recognised  this  in
labelling one of our many national parks as a gift that  not  only  deserves
our care and preservation, but attention and protection even more.

In order to maintain these parks, not only are state  funds  depended  upon,
but donations are also a major source of income,  which  greatly  assist  in
preserving our parks and their affluent content.

The party recognises that the  taxing  of  these  donations  does  not  only
lessen  income,  but  also  diminishes  the  degree  of   preservation   and
maintenance that should be in place. We should not be allowed to  take  away
from what we should be giving. It is therefore felt that  the  accommodation
made in the amending Bill, to exempt SA National Parks from  paying  VAT  on
donations and sponsorships, is in place and correct.  Further,  it  is  felt
that the proposed accommodation to be made by Sars to  donors  and  sponsors
is well deserved. This would represent a token of our appreciation.

The MF commends the department for the amendment made, which certainly  will
serve to boost the funds available to the parks. That  certainly  is  for  a
good cause. Our aim is not to make hay of a benefit  due  to  a  subject  in
need, but, indeed, rather  to  make  hay  of  the  proper  preservation  and
maintenance of the subject at hand.

The MF supports the National Parks Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Voorsitter, die AEB plaas 'n groot premie op die bewaring  van
ons natuurlike erfenis en hierin  speel  ons  Nasionale  Parkeraad  'n  baie
belangrike rol. Ons nasionale parke is 'n nasionale  bate  en  hierdie  bate
moet beskerm word.

Die Parkeraad  is  veel  meer  as  'n  toerisme-organisasie.  Navorsing-  en
bewaringsprojekte bring groot uitgawes mee en op 'n besigheidsgrondslag  kan
hierdie  diens  nie  volgehou  word  nie.  Daarom  is  hierdie   wetsontwerp
noodsaaklik sodat die Nasionale Parkeraad binne die  trefwydte  gebring  kan
word  van  die  woordomskrywing  van  ``verenigings  sonder   winsoogmerk'',
aangesien dit is wat die Nasionale Parkeraad inderdaad is. Dit  is  onlogies
dat 'n organisasie wat hierdie diens lewer BTW  op  skenkings  moet  betaal.
Donasies vir ons parke is bedoel vir Valli Moosa en nie  vir  Trevor  Manuel
nie. Daarom steun ons hierdie wetsontwerp.

Ons vertrou dat dit 'n stimulus sal wees vir  die  broodnodige  invloei  van
skenkings vir ons nasionale parke, en saam met die ACDP, vra  ons  dat  daar
ook gekyk moet word na die moontlikheid van die aftrekbaarheid  van  hierdie
donasies  vir   inkomstebelastingdoeleindes.   Ons   vertrou   dat   hierdie
wetsontwerp ook daartoe sal bydra dat ons land se grootste natuurlike  bate,
die Krugerwildtuin, nie 'n eksklusiewe bestemming word vir die  dollars  van
buitelanders en die ryk elite van Suid-Afrika nie, maar  dat  dit  weer  die
kuierplek sal word van die gewone  man  op  straat,  binne  die  bereik  van
gewone  mense  soos  parlementariërs.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   speech
follows.)
[Mr  C  AUCAMP:  Chairperson,  the  AEB  places  a  huge  premium   on   the
conservation of our  natural  heritage  and  our  National  Parks  Board  is
playing a very important role in this. Our national  parks  are  a  national
asset and this asset must be protected. The Parks Board is much more than  a
tourism organisation. Research and conservation projects  bring  about  huge
expenses and this service cannot be maintained along  business  lines.  That
is why this Bill is imperative so that  the  National  Parks  Board  can  be
brought within the scope of the  definition  of  an  ``association  not  for
gain'', because that is precisely what the National Parks Board  is.  It  is
not logical that an organisation that renders this service must pay  VAT  on
donations. Donations for our parks are meant for Valli Moosa and not  Trevor
Manuel. That is why we support this Bill.

We trust that this will be a stimulus for the essential influx of  donations
for our national parks and with the ACDP we ask that the possibility of  the
deductibility of these donations for income  tax  purposes  should  also  be
looked into. We trust that  this  Bill  will  also  lead  to  our  country's
largest  natural  asset,  the  Kruger  Park,  not  becoming   an   exclusive
destination for the dollars of  foreigners  and  the  rich  elite  of  South
Africa, but that it will again become the visiting  place  of  the  ordinary
man in the street, within reach of normal people like parliamentarians.]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM:  Mr  Chairperson,  may  I
join Mr  Moorcroft  in  congratulating  the  chairperson  of  the  portfolio
committee, the hon Gwen Mahlangu, on the manner in which she  conducted  the
discussion in the portfolio committee on this matter, and also to thank  all
of the members of the portfolio committee and all the speakers today.

May I just say that the hon Pheko made what I think is  quite  an  important
point. He said that we love animals, but we love human beings more. I  think
that is an important point to make. I would  like,  within  the  context  of
that remark, which  I  agree  with,  to  point  out  that  in  the  pre-1994
situation, we had the subsidy to SA National Parks  increasing  every  year.
In the post-1994 situation, the subsidy to SA National Parks  has  decreased
every year.

At the same time, we have increased the extent  of  the  protection  of  the
environment in this country. This has been a very delicate balance  to  work
out. We are a developing country and we have to ask  ourselves  a  question:
can we possibly prioritise spending on the  protection  of  the  environment
over and above spending on the education of children, on the  healthcare  of
pregnant mothers and on all of the basic needs that the poor people have  in
this  country?  Obviously,  we  cannot  prioritise  the  protection  of  the
environment over and above the protection of human beings, children,  women,
the aged, etc.

This is what brings us to developing a particular model which we think  will
act as a model for the rest of the African continent, where it  is  possible
for us to protect the environment, to expand our parks and at the same  time
reduce the burden on the taxpayer, and not create  a  burden  on  the  poor.
That is the model we have worked out.

Let me just give hon members an example of some of  the  figures.   In  1994
the Government subsidy to SA National Parks was 29% of its total income.  At
that time the income of SA National Parks was  R173  million.  In  2001  the
total subsidy as a percentage of its income has dropped  from  29%  to  15%.
The income of SA National Parks at the moment is R327 million.  So,  it  has
gone up from R173 million in 1994 to R327 million in 2001. The  subsidy  has
remained around R50 million a year - more or less static -  which  means  it
has been dropping sharply over the years.

What has happened? Exactly in the period 1994  to  2001  SA  National  Parks
have expanded more and faster than in any other  comparable  period  in  its
entire history. That is because it is possible for us to work  out  a  model
which will ensure that conservation can, to a large extent, pay for  itself.
And we think it can. The Kruger National Park is one  of  the  best  tourism
destinations in the world, and there is no reason why poor taxpayers  should
be subsidising the holiday-makers who go there.  I  think  we  have  already
established that.

Hon Mr Moorcroft and others have pointed out that SA National  Parks  is  in
financial difficulties. That is true. I  would  like  to  assure  them  that
those financial difficulties do not however constitute a crisis.  Government
is attending to the matter. The Minister of Finance and I are  looking  into
this matter very closely. These are the jewels of our country and we  cannot
allow them to go under. So, hon members can rest assured as far as  that  is
concerned.
As far as the concessioning of some of the tourism operations in  the  parks
is concerned, here again hon members can be quite  assured  that  both  that
and, more particularly, the donations and sponsorships that a park  receives
generally go into capital expenditure, land acquisition  and  infrastructure
work, and not into recurrent expenditure as such. This is the way  in  which
we were able to expand our parks.

The hon Mr Swart asked a question: When will  the  results  of  the  inquiry
into the deaths caused by veld fire in the Kruger National Park  last  month
be released? I must say that I am not certain about that, but I do  get  his
point that it is something that should be speeded up.  I  will  try  to  get
that information and furnish him with it.

Let me finally make the point that  already  the  model  which  we  have  is
beginning to make sense in other countries. For example, Mozambique  is  one
of the least developed  nations  in  the  world,  and  one  of  the  poorest
countries in the world that we have today. Yet Mozambique is in the  process
of declaring Coutada 16, which is part of the Gaza  province  adjoining  the
Kruger National Park, as a national park in terms of Mozambican  law,  which
will give it the highest level of conservation protection. This was not  the
case in the past - it was a sort  of  hunting  area.  They  are  doing  that
because of the Great  Limpopo  Transfrontier  Park  which  is  about  to  be
established.

The hon Pheko should note that what has been realised is  that  by  creating
these parks we are creating economic opportunities for the  poor.  The  best
example of that has been the Makuleke community,  which  has  been  given  a
portion of the Kruger National Park because they claimed it during the  land
claim  process.  The  Makuleke  community  was  forcibly  removed  from  the
northernmost  part  of  the  Kruger  National  Park  in  the  1960s.   After
democratisation they said that was their  land.  Government  looked  at  the
matter - I think hon Hanekom was the Minister at the time  -  and  they  got
their land back. What did the Makuleke community decide  to  do?  They  said
they were not going to remove that land from the Kruger National Park.  They
would leave it as part of the Kruger National Park and  were  not  going  to
reoccupy it. They would use it  rather  as  an  ecotourism  destination  and
derive the ecotourism benefits, and leave it under the conservation  of  the
Kruger National Park.

So, I think for the first time what we have is the rich and the poor  living
side by side, and participating in what is a  very  ambitious  programme  of
creating a model which will ensure that our parks,  regardless  of  whatever
may happen to our economy in the future, do not go down  the  path  of  what
has happened to parks in some other developing countries. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                      MERCHANDISE MARKS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Mr Chairperson, this  amending  Bill  is
in essence a housekeeping Bill and I will not dwell on it  at  length.  What
we are doing is to rationalise and clean  up  the  definitions  within  this
Bill  to  clearly  distinguish  between  the  terms  ``device'',   ``mark'',
``name'' and the trade mark concept itself.

In addition to that we are dealing with certain other matters such as  well-
known trademarks. This  is  aligned  with  the  amendment  we  made  to  the
Counterfeit Goods Bill recently.  We  are  dealing  with  the  questions  of
heraldic images, flags, etc, which we need to deal with.

There has been an interesting discussion in the  committee  on  the  growing
complexity of the link between rules of origin and the emerging  Merchandise
Marks Act. This is something that we  will  have  to  address  at  a  future
stage. But currently the position, I think, is relatively  clear.  With  the
proliferation of free trade  agreements  that  are  emerging  in  the  world
today, we may well have to address this matter of  harmonising  the  concept
of rules of origin marks and labelling in  general  with  the  international
trade system.

However, I believe this is a housekeeping Bill and  we  urge  the  House  to
support it. [Applause.]

Mrs B N SONO: Mr Chairperson, hon members, the Merchandise  Marks  Amendment
Bill seeks to amend the Merchandise Marks Act of 1941 so  as  to  define  an
expression and to amend certain definitions,  to  make  provision  regarding
the application of  trade  descriptions  to  goods  and  the  alteration  of
trademarks.

The DP accepts the fact  that  the  adjustment  effected  by  this  Bill  is
necessary for the economy to be  competitive  and  to  benefit  from  global
trade. The DP  also  recognises  South  Africa's  obligations  in  terms  of
Article VI of the Paris Convention. The  DP  however  wishes  to  voice  its
concern that as this Parliament steams ahead with legislation  and  amending
Bills, the irony is that a lot of bureaucracies are  created  to  deal  with
provisions  of  legislation,  but  the  economy  is  not  growing.   Through
legislation only  bureaucrats  are  being  enriched.  Whilst  we  legislate,
legislation has no Marshall Plan to talk to, no  Marshall  Plan  to  unleash
and harness the huge, diverse entrepreneurial culture so  abundant  in  this
country. The Government's role should be to create a regulatory  environment
in which business can operate and prosper, and to develop  a  Marshall  Plan
to give economic direction and facilitate development.

For many years, products with brand names and flags from overseas  countries
have  been  freely  traded  in  in  South  Africa   by   our   up-and-coming
entrepreneurs, alias hawkers, in the  informal  sector.  Recent  legislation
regulating and controlling the sale of these illegally imported  goods  have
resulted in the forfeiture and confiscation of  these  goods,  much  to  the
suffering and concern of the hawker who  innocently  bought  these  products
from unscrupulous importers. This Bill with  its  good  intentions,  despite
controlling the various applications of trade descriptions  to  goods,  will
at the same time take away an opportunity for the informal sector to earn  a
living.

Following this legislation, the DP believes that  the  Department  of  Trade
and Industry must seriously look at ways  and  means  of  supplementing  the
void created  regarding  illegal  goods  brought  about  by  this  piece  of
legislation. Here the DP would encourage the replacement  of  illegal  goods
with equal-quality goods of South African origin in the South Africa  market
as an incentive to increase the number of hawkers on the one hand,  and  the
promotion of South Africa's manufactured goods on  the  other.  Institutions
that  Government  sets  up  use  the  same  rules  that  were   applied   by
institutions that traditionally disempowered people.

About a month ago this Parliament passed the IDC Amendment  Bill,  enlarging
the IDC's scope of activity into the SMME arena. But, there is  no  plan  to
begin to address the huge problem of  a  fragmented  SMME  sector,  to  help
sustain the programme of action that the IDC is to embark on.  Let  us  take
the Cape Venture Capital Fund as an  example.  Whilst  there  is  access  by
entrepreneurs to these funds, there should be a shift away from the way  the
funds are being accessed. But because of a fragmented sector  and  the  fact
that the huge informal SMME sector still has to be exposed to  sophisticated
financial instruments, there is  no  plan  even  to  develop  the  financial
services market to help it to operate at an optimal level.

The DP supports this Bill with the hope that at some stage a  Marshall  Plan
will emerge for purposes of convergence of legislation.

Dr R H DAVIES: Chairperson, as has already been indicated, this  is  largely
a technical Bill which was in  fact  passed  unanimously  by  the  portfolio
committee. The main  thing  it  does,  as  the  Minister  indicated,  is  to
introduce in the definitions a distinction between the  terms  ``mark''  and
``registered  trademark'',  and   to   extend   protection   to   well-known
international marks from countries that are members of the Paris  Convention
that may not be registered in South Africa, provided that  they  follow  the
procedures that are laid out in section 35 of the Trademarks  Act.  Most  of
the amendments in the Bill are consequential upon this.

As was referred to by the Minister and by Mrs Sono  just  now,  perhaps  the
main  new  provision  that  the  Bill  introduces  is  to  extend  to  Paris
Convention member countries provisions that have been entrenched in our  own
laws since 1997, prohibiting the use of national flags, coats  of  arms  and
other state emblems in products that are registered  as  trademarks,  unless
permission is sought. What this means is that if one wants to  use  a  state
emblem of a Paris Convention country, one has to get  permission  from  that
jurisdiction or minister.

The hon Sono made a big song and dance about the fact that there are  people
who apparently have been trading in these products on a large  scale.  I  do
not know where  they  are.  I  do  not  see  too  many  emblems  from  other
countries. But what she does not seem to realise is that,  as  a  member  of
the Paris Convention, there is a reciprocal obligation on all other  members
countries of the Paris Convention to do the same.  In  fact,  the  abuse  of
state emblems is largely something which is  affecting  us  negatively  with
regard to, for example, reproductions of images  of  our  former  President,
flags and other items. I think we  probably  have  more  to  gain  from  the
passage of this piece of legislation in  terms  of  getting  enforcement  in
other jurisdictions of our own rights to our own national  emblems  than  we
have to lose in terms of the one or two traders who  might  be  using  flags
and images of foreign presidents in our country.

As the Minister indicated, there was one clause that led us to raise  a  few
questions in the committee. This was clause 6 of the  amending  Bill,  which
amends section 9 of the principal Act. Section 9  requires  that  any  goods
which are not made or produced in South Africa and which bear a mark  in  an
official South African language should include a conspicuous  indication  of
the name of  the  country  where  this  product  was  manufactured.  Such  a
provision is important for a number of reasons. It could,  for  example,  be
important in the light of the ``Proudly South African'' campaign  which  was
launched last week. Perhaps it could also be  important  in  the  spirit  of
promoting regional  integration  to  develop  a  positive  attitude  towards
products which originate in our neighbouring  countries,  that  is,  in  the
SADC region.

From the questions which we asked it was not clear to us that section 9,  as
it is currently formulated, sufficiently takes into account the  reality  of
goods that are produced and marketed, and this  includes  inputs  from  more
than one country. In fact,  the  provisions  in  section  9  offer  no  real
guidance on how the country of  origin  of  goods  which  have  inputs  from
several countries should be described in terms of this legislation.  As  the
Minister  indicated,  there  is  no   necessary   conformity   between   the
requirements  in  this  legislation  and  the  rules  of  origin  in   trade
agreements. This means that consumers cannot necessarily be  confident  that
goods which bear a signal indicating that they were made in  a  neighbouring
country conform with the  local  content  requirements  of  the  SADC  trade
protocol, although if the goods entered the country  legally  and  benefited
from the duty-free or tariff reduction provisions  of  the  trade  protocol,
they would have to do so.

As the amendment to section 9 in this Bill was purely consequential  to  the
introduction of the new definitions, and as nobody had any objection to  it,
we accepted it at that stage. However, I was pleased to  hear  the  Minister
saying it was something that needed looking at in  future.  With  these  few
words, we are happy to support the Bill.

Mr H J BEKKER: Chairperson, the most important objective of this Bill is  to
amend the principal Act of 1941 and  bring  it  into  line  with  the  Paris
Convention to which South Africa is a signatory.  The  applicable  amendment
in this case is to prohibit the unauthorised use of state emblems  of  those
state members which are signatories to the Paris Convention.

In terms of this convention, member states are encouraged  to  prohibit  the
use of these emblems without proper authorisation. Due to the fact that  the
Paris Convention is  part  of  the  Trade-Related  Aspects  of  Intellectual
Property Rights Agreement, better known as Trips, South  Africa  is  obliged
to  include  the  provisions  of  article  6  of  the  convention   in   our
legislation.

The above amendment is important, as it recognises state emblems as  a  form
of intellectual property similar to trademarks  and  patent  rights.  Member
states of the Paris Convention can therefore  rightfully  claim  that  their
state emblems are their intellectual property. As is the case in respect  of
all other forms of  such  rights,  proper  authorisation  must  be  obtained
before the emblems may be used, for  instance,  in  advertising,  marketing,
manufacturing and promotional activities.

Furthermore, the Bill also outlaws false trade descriptions being  used  and
makes their use an offence. For instance, false labelling of a product as  a
product of South Africa when it was in fact manufactured in another  country
and then imported, would be an offence under the amended  Act.  This  is  an
important amendment, as it extends protection to  legitimate  manufacturers,
producers and traders of products for the export  market  and  ensures  that
only legitimate South African products may be marketed as such.

Since we are about to embark on  the  ``Proudly  South  African''  campaign,
this legislation is timeous. With this legislation in place, action  can  be
taken against businesses abusing the emblems of our country.  The  amendment
is logical and therefore the IFP will support this Bill.

Dr R T RHODA: Chairperson, at present a measure of  overlap  exists  between
the provisions of the  Counterfeit  Goods  Act,  Act  37  of  1997  and  the
Merchandise Marks Act, Act 17 of 1941 in so far as they relate to  trademark
rights. The Counterfeit Goods Act was promulgated with the specific view  of
ensuring  appropriate  protection  against  counterfeiting  in  relation  to
trademark rights recognised by statutes,  in  particular  in  terms  of  the
Trademarks Act, Act 194 of 1993.

The present definition of ``trade description''  in  the  Merchandise  Marks
Act can be interpreted to include trademark rights.  This  has  led  to  the
practical problem that in some instances the South  African  Police  Service
refuses to act in  terms  of  the  Counterfeit  Goods  Act  and  prefers  to
continue to act in terms of the Merchandise Marks  Act.  Amendments  to  the
Merchandise Marks Act are therefore necessary to clarify that this Act  does
not relate to all trademarks conferred by the Trademarks Act of  1993.  This
entails several consequential amendments being made to the various  sections
of the Act to  achieve  the  desired  objective.  The  substances  of  these
sections remain unaltered, however.

In regard to clause 2 of the Bill, which amends section 2 of  the  principal
Act, the changes and definitions of  the  Act,  as  amended,  have  made  it
necessary, from a tactical drafting  point  of  view,  to  insert  the  word
``false'' in specified places. But again, these tactical changes  leave  the
substance of section 2 unaltered.

The proposed amendment to the definition of  ``trademark''  now  includes  a
reference to ``a well-known trademark contemplated  in  section  35  of  the
Trade Marks Act of 1993''. The new definition for ``mark'' is in  line  with
the definition for ``mark'' that is currently in the Trade  Marks  Act,  Act
194 of 1994, but for the fact that it excludes a trademark.

The proposed amendments of sections 2, 6 and 8 of the Merchandise Marks  Act
deal with acts which amount to false trade descriptions  and  seek  to  make
such activities unlawful. The intention has, however, always been  that  the
Merchandise Marks Act should continue to regulate the position  with  regard
to the alteration of any trademark, whether by addition or effacement or  in
any other manner. Certain minor clarifying amendments in  that  regard  were
also required and have been incorporated.
Lastly, in terms of article 6  of  the  Paris  Convention  South  Africa  is
obliged to prohibit  the  unauthorised  use  of  national  flags,  memorials
bearing official signs, hallmarks and  the  like  of  convention  countries,
including the Republic of  South  Africa.  The  Merchandise  Marks  Act  was
regarded as inadequate and the proposed amendments will bring it  into  line
with the provisions of the Paris Convention.

The New NP supports this Bill.

Mr C T FROLICK: Mr Chairperson and hon members, the amending Bill before  us
seeks to further entrench the protection  of  intellectual  property  rights
regarding trademarks.

In an increasingly globalised marketplace it is of special  importance  that
trademarks and intellectual property are sufficiently protected.  The  Paris
Convention plays a central role in this regard. It is, therefore, of  utmost
importance for South Africa, as a signatory of that  convention,  to  comply
with its provisions, as this Bill sets out to do.

It will be interesting, though, to know from the hon  the  Minister  whether
large trading countries such as China and other  countries  are  signatories
to the convention and the impact it will  have  on  us,  what  the  cost  of
compliance with the convention is and which monitoring  mechanisms  will  be
put in place to ensure that other signatories comply with it. Similarly,  we
must ensure that other countries are held responsible for their  agreements.


The protection of intellectual property  rights  is  dependent  upon  mutual
commitment  and  co-operation.  It  is  imperative  that   Government   take
transgressions of this nature to the proper forum such as  the  World  Trade
Organisation, the WTO, and the Workshop In Business Opportunities, or  WIBO.


Since the amendments are usually of a  technical  nature  the  UDM  supports
these amendments.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Mr Chairperson and hon members,  the  regular  overhaul  of
legislation is most welcome in  order  to  keep  the  laws  of  the  country
dynamic.

This piece of legislation is long overdue. However,  it  is  just  what  the
doctor ordered, particularly in respect of national  symbols,  since  almost
everybody can just display anything as if it were a national symbol.

It is so embarrassing when one sees a huge truck wearing the colours of  the
national flag  as  if  that  truck  belongs  to  the  state.  Some  security
companies go to the extent of using the  national  flag  as  their  logo  on
their uniforms, giving a very misleading impression that they  are  national
institutions.

The passing of this Bill will ensure  that  individuals,  private  companies
and institutions do not enhance their images and portray themselves as  part
of the national body. On these grounds the UCDP supports this Bill.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Mr Chairperson, the Merchandise Marks Amendment Bill  amends
a very old law, ie the Merchandise Marks Act of 1941.  It  is  obvious  that
this Act cannot remain the same after 60 years.

The purpose of this Bill is to amend certain  definitions  to  make  further
provision regarding the application of trade descriptions to goods  and  the
alteration of trademarks to clarify the scope of the Act in its  implication
to trademarks. The amendment prohibits  the  unauthorised  use  of  national
flags.

The PAC's comment on the use of the national flag in this  country  is  that
it is often used for private  interests  to  a  point  where  it  loses  its
national symbolism. To many  it  is  just  a  piece  of  cloth  without  any
patriotic attachment to it.

Section's 2, 3, 4 and 6, respectively, provide important  headings  which  I
am not going to mention because my time is very limited.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Mr Chairperson, the MF respects the need for  the  Republic
to comply with the Paris Convention that stipulates  that  the  unauthorised
use of a nation's flags and state emblems is prohibited, and  thus  commends
the department for making provision for this.

A nation's flag and state emblem tell a story of its  people,  heritage  and
content that, without question, deserves respect. The party agrees that  the
use of these should be governed by a  mechanism  that  ensures  against  its
abuse. It is further recognised that we need to fill the  loopholes  in  the
Trade  Mark  Act  as  well  as  the  Counterfeit  Goods  Act  and  the   Act
acknowledges that the amending Bill accommodates this.

The  MF  also  appreciates  the   clarification   the   Bill   provides   by
distinguishing   between    ``mark'',    ``name'',    ``devise'',    ``trade
description'' and ``trademark''. This will allow  for  better  understanding
and categorisation. The MF supports the  Mechandise  Marks  Amendment  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, it is encouraging that South Africa adheres  to
international conventions such as the Paris Convention. South  Africa  is  a
country amongst the important ones in the international gallery  of  states.
Adherence to these conventions proves that we are  not  a  banana  republic.
Therefore the AEB supports this Bill.

False labelling, fakes and the misuse of national  symbols,  including  that
of the springbok, must be outruled.

Ons  stem  dat  ons  nasionale  simbole  nie  misbruik  word  vir   goedkoop
kommersiële gewin nie. [We vote that our national  symbols  are  not  misuse
for cheap commercial gain.]

This case is a little warning. Today one can find antique  pieces  from  the
old government, the  coat  of  arms  and  the  protea  at  auctions  selling
silverware, furniture and so on. I ask the hon the Minister  to  see  to  it
that our history is not auctioned away. This morning in the Rules  Committee
Parliament decided that the curator must look at that. Is  it  not  possible
for all other state departments to be alerted so that they do not let  these
things be lost at random?

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Mr Chairperson, may I begin by  thanking
the members of the committee for the work they  did  with  regard  to  these
technical amendments. I believe that it is important  that  people  look  at
these and study them, and I must say that I have always  been  impressed  by
the members' knowledge of the technicalities of these Bills. They  are  very
important and I think that the more informed our committees are, the  better
the quality of our legislation. So I  would  sincerely  like  to  thank  the
committee members for taking these matters seriously.

I want to deal with one or two matters that  were  raised.   Firstly,  I  do
find it somewhat disappointing that the spokespersons of the DA  or  the  DP
continually focus on  the  negative.  They  talk  about  the  South  African
economy's problems, but if one were to look at the South  African  economy's
growth rate at present, we are one  of  the  few  economies  in  the  world,
certainly the emerging world, that has a positive growth  rate.  Why  do  we
not talk about this? We are always talking about the negative.

Let me also say quite categorically that  matters  such  as  trademarks  and
other things are related to international conventions. They have nothing  to
do with old apartheid regimes or anything like that.

Let us therefore not create any false expectations that anybody,  a  hawker,
a businessperson, no matter who they are, can violate these  laws.  We  will
not tolerate anybody, no matter who they  are,  breaking  the  law,  and  we
should not give cause for people to have  an  expectation  that  somehow  we
condone their actions of breaking the law. I find it most  unacceptable  for
a party in this Parliament to talk in that manner.

Regarding China and other countries, I want to say briefly that one  of  the
reasons South Africa so strongly supports China's accession to the  WTO,  is
that one cannot have one of the world's largest economies outside the  world
trading system. I think it is very important that they come in  so  that  we
can deal with this matter systematically with all countries.

I want to urge MPs, who are now experts on these  matters,  that  when  they
travel abroad they should please help us monitor these laws  and  report  to
us any transgression they see.

I think we should be concerned about our heritage, but there  is  nothing  I
can do to stop the auctioning of a coat  of  arms  that  is  no  longer  the
national coat of arms. From a historical point of view, we should  not  take
heirlooms, antiques and other matters and treat them lightly. These will  be
valuable property one day. If there is some  way  the  Department  of  Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology can deal with this, it may be useful.

I want to thank members for their support of  this  Bill.  It  is  important
that South Africa keeps pace with the changing  developments  in  the  world
trade system. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

5.    Report of the Portfolio Committee  on  Trade  and  Industry  on  Study
     Visit to World Trade Organisation, Geneva, dated 19 September 2001:


     The Portfolio Committee on Trade  and  Industry,  having  undertaken  a
     study visit to the World Trade Organisation in Geneva  from  23  to  26
     July 2001, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         Between 23 and 26 July 2001, a delegation made  up  of  members  of
         the Portfolio Committee  on  Trade  and  Industry  and  the  Select
         Committee on Economic Affairs travelled  to  Geneva  to  meet  with
         officials of  and  delegations  to  the  World  Trade  Organisation
         (WTO). The delegation comprised the following  members  and  staff:
         Dr R H Davies (Chairperson), Mr S M Rasmeni, Ms C C September,  Mrs
         B M Ntuli, Ms R N Shope, Mr Z Kotwal, Ms E Thabethe (ANC); Mr  N  S
         Bruce, Ms N B Sono (DP); Mr H J Bekker (IFP);
         Mr F Beukman (New NP); Mr C T  Frolic  (UDM);  Mr  M  V  Moosa  (SC
         Chairperson), Mr S L E Fenyane (ANC); Dr E A Conroy (New  NP);  Mrs
         L S Matshikiza (Committee Secretary) and Ms S Naidoo  (Departmental
         Liaison Officer).


         The aim of the visit was to acquaint ourselves  with  some  of  the
         issues and  perspectives  ahead  of  the  WTO  Ministerial  Meeting
         scheduled to take place in Doha in November this  year.  Our  visit
         took place at a propitious time. During our  stay  in  Geneva,  the
         Chairperson of the General Council and the Director-General  issued
         a report on The Current State of Preparatory Work, and many of  our
         informants reflected on themes in that report.


         We had an opportunity to engage with a  number  of  key  officials,
         including the Director-General, Mr Mike  Moore,  as  well  as  with
         representatives of several key delegations. We are grateful to  the
         South  African  Mission  to  the  United  Nations  in  Geneva   and
         especially to the Representative to the WTO, Mr Xavier Carrim,  for
         arranging an excellent programme.


         The report on The Current State  of  Preparatory  Work  notes  that
         while the launch of a new multi-sectoral Round of  negotiations  at
         Doha "is effectively the working hypothesis" of  many  delegations,
         others remain unconvinced. It acknowledges that "more needs  to  be
         done to meet the concerns of some WTO  members,  particularly  some
         developing and least-developed countries, about  the  prospects  of
         taking on new negotiations when they face  problems  with  existing
         commitments", and indicates that there are still  substantial  gaps
         in the positions of delegations on important questions. The  report
         says that the bridging of these gaps in the  short  time  available
         will be "difficult and complex" and says that a failure  to  arrive
         at a consensus for the agenda  for  Doha  in  the  next  few  weeks
         "could call into question both our approach to decision-making  and
         the value of the WTO as a forum  for  negotiations".  Some  of  our
         informants told us that unless these gaps  were  narrowed  the  WTO
         risked becoming merely another Geneva-based talkshop,  and  appeals
         have been publicly made to delegations to return from the  northern
         hemisphere summer recess  with  a  greater  willingness  to  modify
         positions.


     B.     Background
         The immediate background to the present  processes  is  the  failed
         third WTO Ministerial Meeting held in  Seattle  in  December  1999.
         While  much  media  attention  focused  on  the  anti-globalisation
         protests outside the Seattle meeting, its failure was as  much  due
         to the lack of agreement among  delegations  participating  in  the
         proceedings.  The  1987-1993   Uruguay   Round   of   multi-lateral
         negotiations, which resulted in the establishment of the  WTO,  had
         created what is increasingly acknowledged as an unequal and  uneven
         rules-based global trading  system.  The  Uruguay  Round  had  been
         dominated by  demands  of  advanced  industrialised  countries  and
         powerful transnational  corporations.  In  adopting  the  Marrakech
         Agreement  arising  from  that  Round,  it  was  acknowledged  that
         developmental issues had not received adequate attention  and  that
         various steps to address what  are  now  known  as  "implementation
         issues" needed to be taken. Some 92  "implementation  issues"  have
         been identified, some requiring textual changes to  the  Agreement.
         The Marrakech Agreement also provided for  reviews  of  the  Trade-
         related Intellectual  Property  measures  (TRIPS)  and  the  Trade-
         related  Investment  Measures   (TRIMS),   as   well   as   further
         negotiations on agricultural trade and  trade  in  services.  These
         negotiations (known as the "mandated negotiations") duly  began  on
         schedule  at  the  beginning  of  2000,   but   it   is   generally
         acknowledged that many developed country  delegations  are  holding
         back their final offers on  subsidies  and  market  access  pending
         greater clarity on a possible new Round. Meanwhile, at  the  second
         WTO Ministerial Meeting held in Singapore  in  1995,  several  OECD
         countries  indicated  their  ambition  for  the  WTO  to  negotiate
         agreements  on  a  range  of  "new  issues",  including  investment
         policy, competition policy, e-commerce and government  procurement,
         as well as labour and environmental  standards.  Other  delegations
         have also raised subjects like debt and trade. The Seattle  meeting
         convened with many of these issues  unresolved  in  the  vain  hope
         that the gaps between delegations would be bridged in a few days.


         For  developing  countries,  the  fundamental  issue  at  stake  is
         restructuring the global economy and global  trading  system  in  a
         more  equitable  manner.  The  Marrakech   Agreement   required   a
         significant percentage lowering of average tariff  levels  as  well
         as compliance with a range of "trade-related"  obligations  (TRIPS,
         TRIMS), but also allowed developed countries to maintain  in  place
         a  range  of  protectionist   barriers   against   products   where
         developing countries had a competitive advantage or  could  acquire
         one.  Officials  told  us  that  OECD  subsidies  on   agricultural
         products were now costing the equivalent of two thirds of  the  GNP
         of Africa and that their removal could return to Africa  an  amount
         of more than three times all Official Development Aid. In its  1999
         Trade and Development Report, UNCTAD, which we also  visited  while
         in Geneva, estimated that the removal of tariff peaks,  escalations
         and  non-tariff  barriers  on   non-agricultural   products   where
         developing countries had or could acquire a competitive  advantage,
         could add $700 billion to export  earnings.  Addressing  issues  of
         capacity in developing countries and providing for  more  effective
         Special and Differential Treatment for poorer  countries  are  also
         seen as key challenges. All in  all,  as  a  number  of  developing
         countries are arguing, producing a more  equitable  trading  system
         in   which   developing   countries   benefit   more   fully   from
         globalisation  requires  major  structural  change  in  the   world
         economy, with developed economies in particular  being  willing  to
         undergo  significant  structural  adjustment  to  provide   greater
         access to developing economies in areas where the  latter  have  an
         actual or potential competitive advantage.


     C.     Main Groupings and Current Positions


         The main groupings and positions being adopted at the time  of  our
         visit were:


         At the one end of the spectrum are the European Union  (EU),  Japan
         and some other OECD countries which are calling for a  new  "broad-
         based"  Round,  focusing  on  a  number  of  the  "new  issues"   -
         competition policy, investment, e-commerce, etc.  In  the  case  of
         the EU, this is being argued, in part at least,  as  providing  the
         best possibility of a  more  significant  trade-off  on  issues  of
         concern  to  developing  countries,  particularly  on  agricultural
         trade. Significantly, no delegation is now  demanding  that  labour
         standards as an actionable issue  in  terms  of  the  WTO  disputes
         mechanism be put on the agenda. As far as investment is  concerned,
         among proponents of an early  investment  agreement  the  consensus
         appears to be moving towards a "bottom up/closed list" approach  in
         which all sectors  would  be  closed  except  those  identified  by
         countries  for   liberalisation.   Liberalisation   would   require
         providing  access  for  foreign  investors   and   according   them
         "national treatment".  Our  informants  insisted  that  that  meant
         treatment that was equivalent to the  best  provided  to  nationals
         (in Malaysia's case,  equivalent  to  that  provided  to  bumuputra
         companies). However,  debate  is  continuing  on  obligations  that
         could be imposed on investors in terms of training,  etc,  as  well
         as on the use of investment incentives.


         At the other end of the spectrum lie India,  Pakistan  and  several
         other developing countries (including some SADC members)  known  as
         the "like-minded group". They oppose the  launching  of  a  "broad-
         based" Round, arguing that the WTO should focus  on  "re-balancing"
         the existing Agreement and that its work agenda should be  confined
         to "implementation issues" and the  "mandated  negotiations".  They
         argue that the WTO and developing countries in particular lack  the
         capacity to effectively address  "re-balancing"  and  "new  issues"
         simultaneously,  and  fear   that   as   in   the   Uruguay   Round
         developmental concerns could simply  be  swamped  by  complex  "new
         issue" negotiations.


         Between these lie the majority of WTO members. The  United  States,
         after some hesitation, has now also come out in favour of a "broad-
         based" Round. The US is, however, not a demandeur  on  such  issues
         as competition policy and investment, but  has  indicated  that  it
         will not block a consensus,  should  one  arise.  The  US's  stated
         preference is for a new Round that enlarges  market  access  across
         the globe.


         The Cairns Group (of which South Africa  is  part)  appears  to  be
         willing to contemplate a "broad-based" new Round provided  that  it
         is  tied  to  specific  commitments  in  the  Doha  declaration  on
         agricultural trade.  The  mandated  negotiations  already  underway
         have adopted  negotiating  guidelines  which  have  identified  the
         scope  and  modality  of  negotiations,  but  specific  offers  and
         requests have not yet been tabled. The Cairns Group is  anxious  to
         see  specific  commitments  made  at  Doha  on   the   "progressive
         elimination"  of  trade  distorting  subsidies,   while   the   EU,
         Switzerland and others want much vaguer language in Doha.


         Several other developing countries, including several  from  Latin-
         America, are also reported to be  willing  in  varying  degrees  to
         explore the prospects of a new Round in the expectation  that  this
         might  provide  greater  possibilities  for   the   securing   more
         meaningful concessions of interest to themselves.


         A Communique from SADC Ministers  adopted  on  20  July  identified
         "the key issue for Doha"  as  the  achievement  of  a  "development
         agenda"  encompassing  negotiations   on   implementation   issues,
         mandated negotiations on agriculture  and  trade  in  services  and
         negotiations on industrial tariffs with special emphasis on  tariff
         peaks  and  escalations.  The  Communique  also  said  that   "SADC
         recognises that issues such as trade  and  investment,  competition
         and e-commerce are important, but will  have  to  be  prepared  for
         subsequent negotiations".


         In terms of specific issues not mentioned above, the  TRIPS  review
         discussions are reportedly focusing on pharmaceuticals and  demands
         for flexibility to pursue public health objectives.  Proposals  for
         an international registration system for  "geographic  indications"
         in respect of wine and spirits products (the  Port,  Sherry,  Ouzo,
         Grappa issue) have also been tabled. The mandated  negotiations  on
         services are reportedly making progress with  guideline  statements
         emphasising the right of governments to choose in order to  assuage
         fears that the GATS  will  lead  to  forced  privatisation  of  key
         public services  or  the  undermining  of  governments'  rights  to
         regulate. A "closed list" approach is likely, with discussions  now
         proceeding on proposals for the free movement of  natural  persons.
         Only a few countries,  Japan  among  them,  have  proposed  placing
         "contingent remedies" (anti-dumping and countervailing  duties)  on
         the Doha agenda for  purposes  of  clarifying  the  application  of
         existing  rules,  but  many  delegations  have   yet   to   express
         themselves on this issue.


     D.     Assessment and Perspectives


         The differences between delegations, both  on  the  objectives  and
         scope of the  Ministerial  Meeting  in  Doha  and  on  the  broader
         question of what type of negotiations should  ensue,  suggest  that
         there  are  several  possible   scenarios   with   very   different
         implications.


         The first, alluded to as a warning in the official  report  on  The
         Current State of Preparatory Work, is that Doha like  Seattle  will
         end with no substantial agreement. Officials appear to  be  working
         to avoid  a  complete  fiasco  by  ensuring  that  there  are  some
         "positive announcements" at Doha  -  at  the  very  least  on  some
         "implementation issues" which are  seen  as  a  confidence-building
         exercise and on China's accession, which we were  told,  is  almost
         finalised. As indicated above, WTO officials fear that if  Doha  is
         seen as another failure, it could result in the downgrading of  the
         organisation  and  of  multi-lateral   trade   negotiations.   More
         significantly, some fear that this would lead  to  a  strengthening
         of  partisan  trade  blocs  led  by  particular  developed  country
         regions  and  embracing  selected  developing  countries   to   the
         exclusion of many other poor countries.


         The  second  possible  outcome  of  Doha  is  that  there  is  some
         agreement on aspects of  the  "built  in"  agenda  (implementation,
         reviews and mandated negotiations) that take these forward in  some
         respects, perhaps coupled with a general  statement  of  intent  to
         begin preparations for a possible new Round. The third  possibility
         is that Doha launches a new Round.


         Within the second and  third  possibilities,  several  permutations
         are of course possible with different  emphases  on  "re-balancing"
         and developmental issues on the one hand and "new issues"  proposed
         by developed countries on the other.


         Our own assessment is that the balance of forces is now  such  that
         developing  countries  can  make  significant   advances   in   the
         processes underway.  Developing  countries  are  clearly  now  more
         active,  and  the  processes  while  still   disadvantaging   small
         countries with limited budgets appear to be  more  open  than  they
         were before Seattle. We were repeatedly told  that  the  WTO  is  a
         member-driven organisation, and that members who  are  dissatisfied
         with the outcome of its proceedings can in effect veto  agreements.
         Developing countries appear to be more aware of their power and  to
         be more willing to exercise it.


         On  the  other  hand,  while  there  are  few  that  can  deny  the
         inequities, imbalances and structured disadvantages for  developing
         countries  inherent  in  for   example   the   current   rules   on
         agricultural subsidies, it is not evident to  us  that  the  demand
         for significant structural change to benefit  developing  countries
         requiring significant adjustment by developed economies is  as  yet
         hegemonising current processes. We were told that the  image  which
         best captures the process of negotiation within the WTO is that  of
         a banqueting table in which all bring something to  the  table  and
         receive something from it. The demands of developing countries  for
         "re-balancing" and of developed countries on  "new  issues"  appear
         to us to be regarded by many as equally valid issues  in  a  trade-
         off of equivalences, whereas the reality in a  context  of  growing
         inequality at global level is that  the  former  ought  to  have  a
         clear priority.


         Our delegation, and in particular  Minister  Alec  Erwin,  received
         strong, and in our view well deserved, praise from several  of  our
         informants for the active  and  effective  role  they  are  playing
         within the WTO. At the same time, it seems  to  us  that  we  still
         have some way to go to advance and establish  points  made  in  the
         February  2001  Egyptian-South  African  Position  Paper  such   as
         "...the key to sustained global economic growth lies  in  unlocking
         the growth and development potential of  developing  countries"  or
         "The strategic objective in the  new  negotiations  [must  be]  for
         developed countries to undergo far reaching  structural  adjustment
         in their economies  [including]  reducing  a  range  of  protective
         support  measures  to  inefficient  "grandfather"  industries   and
         sectors in the economies of developed countries, and thereby  allow
         a  relocation  of   production   and   investment   to   developing
         countries".
