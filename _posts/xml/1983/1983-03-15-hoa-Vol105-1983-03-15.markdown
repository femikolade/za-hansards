<debateSection name="#introduction">

<heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>

<p>At the outset I deem it necessary that Parliament and the general public should note the changed role and function of the Post Office in today&#x2019;s society.</p>

<p>Chiefly due to developments in the technological field, electronics in particular, a major shift is manifesting itself in the scope of the more everyday service functions that Post Office staff render to the public by means of physical contact and the more sophisticated services which are being rendered increasingly by electronic apparatus behind the scenes. I am referring here to the traditional services at post offices throughout the country which are decreasing rapidly in relation to the high and increasingly higher volume of transactions performed by means of electronics such as digital telephone and telex calls and the broad application of computer technology both by the Post Office and the users of its infrastructural services.</p>

<p>The transformation brought about by electronics is as far-reaching as the industrial revolution was at the time and comprises the rapid transition of an industrial society based on energy into a computer society based on information. It is the considered opinion of experts that those nations, industries and establishments which respond, adapt and contribute <span class="col_3043-3044" refersTo="page_1550"/>to the change will progress whilst those that fail to do so certainly run the risk of stagnating. We have already reached the point where the computer, telecommunications and electronic systems permeate every facet of our existence. I shall mention a few examples&#x2014;</p>

<ul>

<li>&#x2014; The military capability of a country is presently heavily dependent on electronics for intelligence, communications, surveillance and the guidance of weaponry of all types.</li>

<li>&#x2014; In the field of energy, particularly liquid fuels, there are many ways in which electronics in the form of computers and telecommunications can effect savings. It is cheaper, faster and easier to move information than people.</li>

<li>&#x2014; The potential of television, computer-aided instruction, home computers and video recorders in training and education is unlimited.</li>

<li>&#x2014; Computers, electronic systems and telecommunications have become indispensable in the field of medicine especially as regards diagnosis, treatment and record-keeping.</li>

<li>&#x2014; More than half of a developed country&#x2019;s work force is involved in handling information. Office automation, which is dependent on computers and telecommunications, is already reducing the flow of paper dramatically and expediting decisions.</li>

<li>&#x2014; Electronic money transfers based solely on telecommunications, is changing the traditional pattern of interaction between clients and financial institutions to the benefit of the economy of the country.</li>

</ul>

<p>This transformation of society which is so essential for our progress is not possible unless the Post Office is able to provide an adequate modern digital network to carry the vast stream of voice, text, data and video traffic generated by each sector of society. The huge investments by government, industry and commerce will to a large extent be negated without an enlarged, modernized and properly maintained national telecommunications network.</p>

<p>It demands large investments in expensive equipment, scarce labour and other resources but in the Estimates which I shall table, due cognizance has been taken of the present slow-down in the economy and, in the national interest, capital expenditure in particular for the coming financial year has been curtailed. This will inevitably lead to a slowing-down in the provision of telecommunication services and infrastructure and a backlog which will have to be made up in the years ahead and which will require increasingly larger capital programmes.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#telecommunications">

<heading>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</heading>

<p><i>Telephone services</i></p>

<p>Some 250 000 additional telephone services are expected to be provided during the current financial year. This will bring the number of telephones to approximately 3 459 000 at the end of March 1983 and represents a growth of 7,79%.</p>

<p>Despite the large increase in services it is expected that deferred applications will increase by 32 000&#x2014;or 16,55%&#x2014;to some 225 000 at the end of March 1983. Considering the enormous demand for services and the fact that expansion programmes had to be curtailed in view of the adverse economic climate, a further increase in the waiting list can be expected in the coming year.</p>

<p><i>Telephone exchanges</i></p>

<p>The automatic exchange system will be expanded by approximately 140 000 lines during the current financial year, while our planning for 1983-&#x2019;84 provides for the further extension of the automatic exchange capacity by about 210 000 lines. The capacity of 90 manual exchanges will be increased by a total of 9 950 additional indicators during this financial year and according to our planning a further 154 manual exchanges will be extended during 1983-&#x2019;84 to provide 18 500 additional indicators. Good progress is being made with the electronic telephone exchange programme. The apparatus for altogether 46 of these exchanges with a total capacity of 150 000 lines as well as three trunk exchanges will be delivered to the Post Office in the current financial year.</p>

<p>The first fully electronic French (SA 128E) exchange together with its operations and maintenance centre, installed in Pretoria in 1981 and the first German (EWSD) digital electronic exchange, viz. at Sunninghill Park <span class="col_3045-3046" refersTo="page_1551"/>on the Witwatersrand, have now been in operation for more than a year.</p>

<p>Electronic exchange units with a total capacity of some 19 000 lines are presently being installed at Leeusig (Cape Town) and will be commissioned during the latter part of 1983. The installation of further units, <i>inter alia</i> at Rondebosch, Atlantis, Bloemfontein and Pietermaritzburg, will also commence during this year.</p>

<p><i>Telecommunications Trunk Lines</i></p>

<p>During 1983-&#x2019;84 the national trunk network will be extended by approximately 6 000 circuits, mostly by means of micro-wave systems.</p>

<p>In the past the junction lines in large metropolitan areas were provided exclusively by means of underground cables, and since 1969 sophisticated Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) systems are being used to increase the carrying capacity of these cables.</p>

<p>As from the 1983-&#x2019;84 financial year an increasing number of junction circuits will be provided by means of optical fibre cable systems which involves an entirely new technology with tremendous possibilities for the future. It enables us for example to use extremely thin optical fibre cable with light or laser beams as medium to provide nearly two thousand interference-free speech channels by means of a single pair of optical glass fibres no thicker than a human hair.</p>

<p>The subscribers&#x2019; cable network must be extended continuously to keep pace with the growth of the telephone network. For many years specially imported paper was the only suitable insultation material available for use in these subscribers&#x2019; cables. However, locally produced plastic material is now being used which not only makes us independent of the imported product but also ensures a more reliable telephone service.</p>

<p>With the automation of rural areas, the old type party lines are being replaced gradually by 8 channel and 18 channel carrier systems providing rural farm line subscribers with individual automatic telephone service similar to that in urban areas. This type of service requires capital expenditure of at least R3 000 per subscriber and, in the interests of the farming community, is being installed and maintained at a loss to the post office.</p>

<p><i>&#x2020; International Telephone Service</i></p>

<p>It is expected that the growth in foreign telephone traffic for the coming financial year will be less than the nearly 10% for the present financial year as a result of the uncertain prospects in the economic field.</p>

<p>International communication is made possible by the undersea cable and satellite systems and from time to time very expensive additional equipment must be purchased to provide more channels. For instance, the establishment of a new time-division modulation system which South Africa has to put into use towards the end of 1984, will cost about R4 million. This new method provides more speech channels per satellite than the existing frequency modulation technique.</p>

<p><i>Telephone Switching System</i></p>

<p>The provision of adequate capacity for the connection of telephones to and the switching of calls through the telephone switching system is a complex and capital-intensive operation requiring the finest planning and coordination. The time-span form planning to commissioning is 3 to 4 years.</p>

<p>The unprecedented upsurge in the demand for services which began a few years ago and is still gathering momentum, has given rise to the serious backlog in the provision of telephone service to which I have already referred. The time inevitably taken up by factors such as planning and the manufacture and installation of equipment, as well as financial constraints determines the rate at which additional capacity can be provided. Despite all efforts thus far, it is foreseen that the Department&#x2019;s financial, staff and other resources will be severely taxed in meeting as far as possible the demands being made on it.</p>

<p><i>Telephone Service Quality</i></p>

<p>A system which will continuously monitor the quality of the telephone service is presently being installed. Phase one of the programme will be completed shortly and the rest, for country-wide coverage of the network, over the next 4 years. The system will keep maintenance personnel continuously informed of the average level of service quality and will be a useful aid in establishing the causes of poor service.</p>

<p><i>Subscribers&#x2019; services</i></p>

<p><span class="col_3047-3048" refersTo="page_1552"/>During 1983-&#x2019;84 the new BTS-60 business telephone system and a limited number of coin telephones of a brand-new design will be taken into service.</p>

<p>The business telephone system offers several facilities designed to meet the needs of small and medium-sized business undertakings. It is expected that in time this system will largely replace the manually operated switchboard.</p>

<p>The new type of coin telephone has been designed to provide a more reliable service to the public and to simplify the making of long distance calls&#x2014;including international calls. Some of its features and advantages are: Pre-payment using coins of various denominations; a visual display of the credit available at any moment; the automatic refund of unused coins which have been deposited and the use of any remaining credit for further calls.</p>

<p>The Disa telephone, designed and manufactured in South Africa and which received a design award, will be introduced in April 1983. This telephone with its modem styling and colours will later offer additional features such as a loudspeaker facility and on the hook dialling.</p>

<p><i>Telegraph and Telex Services</i></p>

<p>A decrease in telegram traffic is being experienced world-wide and in this country the number of inland telegrams this year decreased by 25%. Notwithstanding the increased tariffs that were introduced last year the labour-intensive telegram service is being operated at a still greater loss.</p>

<p>The number of telex subscribers increased by 3 276 to 28 000 during the past financial year&#x2014;an increase of 13% compared with just over 15% the previous year. The growth rate of inland telex call units also decreased by 3% during the year; just more than 258 million units were registered which nevertheless represent a growth rate of 5,7%.</p>

<p><i>Teletex Service</i></p>

<p>By May 1983 the new teletex service will be introduced in Johannesburg and Cape Town and the teletex network will be further extended during 1983-&#x2019;84 with the completion of the Durban teletex exchange.</p>

<p>The transmission of messages and information over the teletex service is approximately 40 times faster than via the telex service. The teletex service also has a more comprehensive alphabet than the telex service and makes use of a memory. A user will thus be able to prepare, check and correct letters and other similar documents and afterwards transmit them faultlessly. In addition, the teletex terminal can also be used as an ordinary typewriter and will thus bring about a saving in both time and cost to the client. Teletex and telex subscribers will have access to each other.</p>

<p><i>Videotex</i></p>

<p>Since 1 March 1982, the Post Office has been operating an experimental videotex service to be known as Beitel. This service will enable a user to call up a wide range of information, which will be available in data banks, on the screen of his television set which will be connected to his telephone line.</p>

<p>The trial will continue until at least December 1983 and during this period the Post Office and other interested parties have the opportunity to experiment, solve technical and operating problems, establish data banks and gain experience with this new medium. The fact that Beitel is now operating on a trial basis has given rise to much interest in the business community, resulting in all the presently available facilities being taken up and causing a waiting list of prospective providers of information.</p>

<p><i>Video Conference</i></p>

<p>The experimental video conference service between Cape Town and Pretoria has been provided free of charge to government departments and businesses since November 1981. The popularity of the service is still increasing and at the end of 1982 an average of two conferences per working day were taking place. A tariff for the service will be introduced shortly.</p>

<p><i>Radiocommunication Services</i></p>

<p>An important development during 1982-&#x2019;83 in the field of radiocommunications was the extension of the communal radio repeater station service to various cities and towns where it was not previously available. The purpose of the service is to achieve more efficient <span class="col_3049-3050" refersTo="page_1553"/>utilization of the radio spectrum and also to provide for the radiocommunication needs of the business community.</p>

<p><i>Data Transmission</i></p>

<p>It is expected that an additional 9 300 data services will be provided during this financial year, which represents a growth of 35%. The number of data modems is expected to increase to approximately 28 100 on 31 March 1983.</p>

<p>Since 1978 expenditure on data services has increased on average by 64% per annum, which can be ascribed mainly to the growth in the number of services, the switchover to more expensive high-speed modems and the larger demand for ancillary equipment. It is estimated that an amount of R45 million will be spent on modem installations during 1983-&#x2019;84, thus making an additional 10 500 modems available to the private sector.</p>

<p><i>Packet-Switching</i></p>

<p>The packet-switching service via Saponet was introduced during February 1982. The advantage of data transmission by means of the packet-switching method is that it utilizes the switching network more economically.</p>

<p>Earlier this year we succeeded in obtaining access to the international packet-switching network by means of direct circuits to the United States of America and the United Kingdom. The service will be extended as soon as possible via these countries to Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Spain, Switzerland and West Germany. Data transmission via the packet-switching network is presently about 40% cheaper than via the telephone network.</p>

<p><i>Local Industry</i></p>

<p>Economic and technical problems associated with the establishment and maintenance of an independent telecommunications industry in South Africa has compelled the Post Office to become closely involved in the local manufacture of its telecommunications equipment. In support of local industry over the past decades the Post Office has concluded a series of long-term supply agreements with prominent firms in this field for the local manufacture of electro-mechanical automatic exchange plant and subscribers&#x2019; equipment. The existing agreement, which has been in force since 1979-&#x2019;80, and has a term of 15 years, also provides for special measures to encourage the local manufacture of electronic components.</p>

<debateSection name="#staff">

<heading>STAFF</heading>

<p><i>General Staff Position</i></p>

<p>Heavy demands are being made on the Post Office by the progress made in almost every field of society and for this an efficient and adequate work force is essential. Despite an improvement in the supply of manpower, the shortage of trained staff in certain categories remains a tough problem. I am pleased to say that notwithstanding the problems that are being experienced, the Department has thus far avoided a disruption or curtailment in services.</p>

<p>The sustained growth in the activities of the Department resulted in an increase in the staff&#x2014;permanent and temporary&#x2014;by 9,7% to 83 577 during 1982. During the same period 8 992 officials left the service due to resignations while 3 275 were reappointed, compared with 11 489 and 3 165 respectively during the previous year.</p>

<p><i>Decentralization</i></p>

<p>Endeavours by the Department to move certain functions, where feasible, to areas where labour is more readily available, and at the same time to bring relief to problem areas, are being continued.</p>

<p>Last year my predecessor in his Budget Speech referred to a decision to decentralize the computer organization of the Department by the creation of a second computer centre which will be established in Bellville. The planning in this regard has reached an advanced stage and a site for the erection of a building has already been identified.</p>

<p><i>Retirement Havens for the Aged</i></p>

<p>I am pleased to inform hon. members that as its contribution to the Year of the Aged, my Department last year investigated the need for establishing retirement havens for Post Office pensioners, similar to those of other large institutions such as the South African Transport Services. The finding was that a definite need does exist, especially to accommodate pensioners at that stage of their lives when they are in need of care. <span class="col_3051-3052" refersTo="page_1554"/>Provision has been made in the budget for the first haven which will probably be erected in the PWV area.</p>

<p>Here I should like to mention in passing that in view of the Year of the Aged, the Post Office has decided as a concession to the aged in general, to assist social pensioners with regard to the installation charges for telephone services. While the charge for the installation of a telephone service or for an outdoor transfer will be increased from R50 to R75 with effect from 1 April 1983 and that for an indoor transfer from R25 to R40, social pensioners, namely persons receiving old age pensions, pensions for the blind, disability pensions and war veterans&#x2019; pensions, will only pay R25 for the installation or transfer (indoor as well as outdoor) of a telephone service.</p>

<p><i>General Salary Adjustment</i></p>

<p>As was done in previous years careful consideration was given to the adjustment of salaries in 1983-&#x2019;84, but in the light of the present financial climate Post Office officials cannot, unfortunately, be granted a general salary increase on 1 April 1983. The staff may rest assured, however, that I shall reconsider the whole matter if the economic upswing should manifest itself sooner than expected. At the same time I wish to emphasize that no perquisites or salary increases according to scales will be curtailed and that staff will not be retrenched as an economy measure.</p>

<p>I would have made this announcement with some uncertainty about the possible reaction it would elicit had it not been that during my relatively short association with the Post Office I have taken due note of the loyalty and excellent attitude of its workers. They know that the Post Office would have done its share had circumstances been different, and for the understanding shown by them and the staff associations that represent them, I should like to express the Government&#x2019;s and the Department&#x2019;s sincere appreciation. The coming financial year will demand an unprecedented team effort, but if one is assured of the loyalty and ability of the staff one need not fear the future.</p>

<p><i>Housing</i></p>

<p>The department makes a large contribution towards the alleviation of the housing problems of its officials by making available housing loans and official housing at nominal rentals. An amount of R30 million is being provided in 1983-&#x2019;84 for the granting of housing loans, while expenditure on official housing will amount to approximately R10 million.</p>

<p>Consideration is presently being given to lending an official, under certain circumstances, the deposit he requires for the purchase of a dwelling with a loan from a financial institution that does not make 100% loans available.</p>

<p>The Department also envisages the introduction of a scheme under which its officials may, subject to reasonable conditions, buy existing official houses from the department.</p>

<debateSection name="#posts">

<heading>*POSTS</heading>

<p><i>Reorganization of Postal Operations</i></p>

<p>The Department gives constant attention to the improvement of the postal service and as announced by my predecessor in this House last year a special committee under the chairmanship of the Deputy Postmaster General, Staff and Posts, was also established to investigate the problems being experienced with the postal service and to make recommendations regarding improvements. Projects commenced during the past year to render a better postal service include, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the establishment of mail concentration offices;</li>

<li>(b) the re-routing of mail matter and mailbags;</li>

<li>(c) the introduction of additional direct mail dispatches;</li>

<li>(d) the use of post office vehicles for the conveyance of mail in problem areas; and</li>

<li>(e) the overhaul of postal operating matters in general at the larger mail sorting offices.</li>

</ol>

<p>In areas where these projects were embarked upon, it has been possible to expedite the delivery of a large number of mail items by up to 36 hours.</p>

<p>The Postmaster General and I also visited the operational area where the whole mail <span class="col_3053-3054" refersTo="page_1555"/>dispatch and distribution pattern was reorganized and overhauled a few months ago. Previously, for example, a parcel from Pretoria to Oshakati took 3 days from Pretoria to Grootfontein by rail and from there a further 3 to 4 days by road to Oshakati. Presently all letters and parcels to the operational area are conveyed by air and the travelling time of a parcel to Oshakati is only a few hours. I was delighted to see what this improvement meant to our troops on the border. Family and friends can rest assured that if they write to our young men in the operational area or send them parcels, the Post Office will see to it that the letters or parcels are delivered speedily. That is the contribution we are glad to make towards keeping them happy and motivated.</p>

<p><i>Automatic Sorting Machines</i></p>

<p>Fully automatic letter-sorting machines were installed in Johannesburg and Cape Town during the past year. These machines can process postal articles with printed or typed addresses at a rate of 30 000 per hour. I would like to appeal to major users of the postal service to ensure that postal addresses conform to the prescribed requirements in order that the maximum benefit may be derived from this equipment. We are also in the process of installing semi-automatic sorting machines in Cape Town and Johannesburg for the processing of non-standardized postal articles.</p>

<p><i>International Services</i></p>

<p>The Post Office traditionally maintains good relations with foreign postal administrations. Surface and ocean mails are dispatched direct to 145 destinations in 78 countries and air mails dispatched to 69 destinations in 51 countries. The RSA Post Office acts as a transit administration for surface and airmail to and from neighbouring countries. Surface mail with a mass of approximately 1 394 000 kg and airmail with a mass of about 175 000 kg are handled annually on behalf of these countries.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#buildings">

<heading>BUILDINGS</heading>

<p>As a result of the economic downturn tenders for building contracts are more competitive than before. Type plans for the new generation digital telephone exchanges have been developed by departmental staff and as these buildings are more compact and easier to erect, they can be provided cheaper and faster.</p>

<p>Altogether 47 major capital projects comprising 31 automatic exchange works, 8 Post Offices and 8 miscellaneous services are expected to be completed during the 1982-&#x2019;83 financial year at a cost of about R33 million.</p>

<p>An amount of R100,3 million is being requested for 1983-&#x2019;84 to finance contract already in progress and for the awarding of essential new contracts that cannot be deferred without prejudice to the interests of the department and of the public.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#investment_facilities">

<heading>INVESTMENT FACILITIES</heading>

<p>Good progress is being made with the implementation of the Post Office&#x2019;s electronic savings bank system known as Telebank. The system, which makes use of a plastic card, instead of the traditional savings book, and offers convenient savings and withdrawal facilities by means of counter terminals and automatic teller machines, is already available at the larger Post Offices in the Transvaal, Orange Free State and Northern Cape. By the end of 1983 counter terminals should be in operation at 200 Pos Offices throughout the country whilst we wil also have automatic teller machines in all the large cities.</p>

<p>To achieve a more economical distribution of automatic teller machines negotiations aimed at the sharing of these machines are taking place between the Post Office, banks and building societies. If the negotiations are successful, a customer of any financial institution will be able to use any auto teller that is linked to the shared system.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#finances">

<heading>FINANCES</heading>

<p><i>The 1982-&#x2019;83 Financial Year</i></p>

<p>On the financial side exceptional demand were made on the Department during this financial year, chiefly due to the ever-increasing demand for, in particular, its telecommunication services and to price and cost increases. The increase in general sales tax from 4% to 6%, the introduction of the import levy and the depreciation of the Rand have further contributed to this situation. The Post Office is doing everything possible to alleviate the effect of cost pressures <span class="col_3055-3056" refersTo="page_1556"/>by means of higher productivity, improved work methods and procedures, further rationalization where practicable and improved management techniques in every work sphere. The Post Office is a business getting no subsidy or rebates from the Minister of Finance and should thus be managed in such a way that it can meet the demand for services and will moreover not be run at a loss.</p>

<p>An example of the cost increases with which the Post Office has had to contend is the doubling of staff expenses from R375 million four years ago to the estimated amount of R757 million this financial year. The total operating expenditure will almost have doubled from R820 million to R1 536 million during the same period. In the meantime Post Office tariffs lagged far behind and the adjustments that were made amounted to only 33%. This was indeed a praiseworthy contribution in the fight against inflation and to advancing the economic development of the country.</p>

<p>Together with the problem of price and cost increases we have the unprecedented demand for telecommunication services which despite the slowing-down of economic activities and the provision of a large number of services annually is still increasing. In order to meet the demand as far as possible and to avoid an increase in the backlog, the Department is compelled to embark upon large capital programmes. Thus its capital expenditure has increased from R340 million in 1979-&#x2019;80 to an estimated R847 million for the current financial year, i.e. an increase of 150% over three years or an average of 50% per annum. Such large programmes place high demands on the physical and financial resources of any organization.</p>

<p>As I explained in the debate on the Additional Post Office Budget earlier this session, total expenditure for 1982-&#x2019;83 is estimated at R2 516,8 million which is R229,5 million or 10% higher than voted orginally.</p>

<p>Revenue for 1982-&#x2019;83 is estimated at R1 712,4 million which is R3,8 million or 0,2% lower than originally expected. In constrast to what is being experienced elsewhere due to the slowing-down in economic activities the decrease is relatively small which proves that the demand for Post Office services is not affected to the same degree by economic cycles.</p>

<p>The self-financing component for 1982-&#x2019;83 is estimated at only 27,5% which means that 72,5% of capital expenditure has to be financed from loan funds. This ratio is totally out of step with our financing policy of a median of approximately 50% from own funds and 50% from loan funds with poles of 60% in years when tariffs are adjusted and 40% when tariff adjustments are needed.</p>

<p><i>The 1983-&#x2019;84 Financial Year</i></p>

<p>I have already stated that the Post Office was obliged to cut back on capital expansion for 1983-&#x2019;84 in line with the rest of the public sector.</p>

<p>I have also referred to the waiting list for telephone service which is expected to reach 225 000 at the end of March. If we do not take positive steps to prevent this waiting list and the waiting lists for other services&#x2014;such as data and telex services&#x2014;from increasing further, we will encounter difficulties in future in meeting the country&#x2019;s needs for telecommunication services. It may even harm the economic development of the country.</p>

<p>Apart from taking steps to best meet the immediate need for services in the short term we will naturally not be able to cope without proper and orderly long-term planning. The long lead times associated with the expansion of essential infrastructural capacity require that orders for equipment be placed well in advance of delivery&#x2014;in some instances as much as two to three years. For this reason it is essential that provision is made during a downward phase of the economy to meet the increased demand for services in the following growth phase.</p>

<p>The Post Office continuously strives to keep abreast of rapidly changing technological developments in the field of communications and to provide the Republic and all its inhabitants with the best and most modern services at the lowest possible cost. Modernization requires large investments initially but in the long run, as manufacturing volumes of modernized equipment and systems increase, considerable savings will accrue.</p>

<p>Against this background I should like to give hon. members an outline of expected expenditure and revenue for the coming financial year.</p>

<p><i>Capital Expenditure</i></p>

<p>Provision is being made for capital expenditure <span class="col_3057-3058" refersTo="page_1557"/>of R1 020,9 million. This amount is R174 million (20,5%) higher than the revised figure for 1982-&#x2019;83 and is required mainly for&#x2014;</p>

<ul>

<li>&#x2014; The expansion of the capacity of the existing telecommunication system to carry the rapidly growing traffic volumes;</li>

<li>&#x2014; The limitation of the backlog in the provision of telecommunication services;</li>

<li>&#x2014; the commissioning of the small business telephone system, electronic call office equipment, optical fibre systems, teletex terminal equipment and pulse code modulation equipment;</li>

<li>&#x2014; the larger building programme arising from the larger telecommunication programme;</li>

<li>&#x2014; continued expansion of the computer and computer</li>

<li>&#x2014; the further provision of new and additional postal sorting equipment at various centres; and &#x2014;expected cost escalation.</li>

</ul>

<p><i>Operating Expenditure</i></p>

<p>The total expected operating expenditure of R1 761,6 million is R225,7 million (14,7%) higher than in 1982-&#x2019;83. The higher expenditure is mainly due to&#x2014;</p>

<ul>

<li>&#x2014; Normal growth in activities;</li>

<li>&#x2014; Larger salary expenses due to an increase in staff recruitment and a decrease in staff losses;</li>

<li>&#x2014; Expected cost escalation on transport, maintenance, material and stores; and</li>

<li>&#x2014; Higher interest payments arising from increased loan requirements.</li>

</ul>

<p><i>Revenue</i></p>

<p>Total revenue is estimated at R2 122,9 million which is R410,5 million (23,9%) higher than the revised figure for this financial year. The estimate provides for the higher revenue to be generated by normal growth of the system as well as the increase of 14,6% expected from the tariff increases which will come into effect on 1 April 1983.</p>

<p><i>Financing of Capital Expenditure</i></p>

<p>The estimated capital expenditure of R1 020,9 million will be financed from&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>&#x2014; The expected operating surplus of R185,3 million;</li>

<li>&#x2014; The provision of R238,1 million for depreciation and higher replacement costs of assets;</li>

<li>&#x2014; Approximately R50 million which is expected to be available from investments in the Post Office savings services;</li>

<li>&#x2014; Money on call of R107,5 million; and</li>

<li>&#x2014; Loans of R440 million.</li>

</ol>

<p>On the foregoing basis the self-financing of capital expenditure in 1983-&#x2019;84 is estimated at 41,5%, compared to 27,5% in 1982-&#x2019;83. The improvement is attributable to the tariff increases as announced which are expected to increase our global revenue by 14,6% but the 41,5% self-financing which will be achieved is still really too low for a year in which tariffs are increased. This means that the Post Office must still rely too heavily on expensive loan funds for the financing of its capital expenditure. The alternative is of course higher tariff increases, or lower capital expenditure which is not regarded as being in the national interest at this time.</p>

<p>It is clear however that the users of postal and telecommunication services must in future be prepared to make a larger financial contribution towards the cost of capital investment in the infrastructure required to meet the increasing demand for services. At the present rate of growth and that foreseen for the immediate future, regular tariff increases, as opposed to sporadic increases, are unavoidable if the Post Office is to keep pace at all with the needs of the country.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the Post Office has over a period of years&#x2014;for very good reason&#x2014;not adjusted its tariffs regularly and sufficiently in line with cost increases. In the meantime the users of its services have in the recent period of high inflation had the benefit of tariffs which are among the lowest in the world. This cannot however continue indefinitely and with a self-financing component of less than 28% this year it is clear that the Post Office will fail in its basic duty towards the community if adjustments are not made timeously. In order to correct to a reasonable extent the imbalance in financing, the Post Office is compelled to effect from 1 April 1983 the tariff increases which I have already announced. Besides improving the self-financing ratio, revenue will be sufficiently <span class="col_3059-3060" refersTo="page_1558"/>increased to ward off an operating loss in the coming financial year.</p>

<p>Despite the increase in tariffs, the loss on the postal service will still amount to some R74 million in 1983-&#x2019;84, compared to the estimated loss of R82,9 million in this financial year. If tariffs had not been increased the loss in 1983-&#x2019;84 would have amounted to nearly R107 million.</p>

<p>The loss on the Gentex service&#x2014;public telegram service&#x2014;will increase further from R25,2 million in the current financial year to R29,7 million in 1983-&#x2019;84; the tariffs of the Gentex service have not been increased.</p>

<p>It is still the department&#x2019;s aim gradually to adjust the tariffs of uneconomical services in order in time to reduce the extent of their subsidization by the profitable services.</p>

<p>Although I am not legally obliged to announce tariff increases in my Main Budget Speech&#x2014;as has already been explained by my predecessor, this may also be done outside parliamentary sessions&#x2014;I believe it will serve a good purpose if at all possible and unless circumstances at any time dictate otherwise to announce increases in the budget speech. Apart from the announcement in the budget of tariff increases, if any, for the next financial year, I also intend in future to go further and to give an indication of the need for and extent of tariff increases for the ensuing financial year. Not only will this give hon. members a timely opportunity to conduct a debate on the tariff increases, but will also assist organized commerce and industry, and for that matter the general public too, in their own financial planning and budgets.</p>

<p>In conclusion I shall once more like to refer to the staff of the Post Office who often under difficult circumstances cheerfully perform an exacting task. They serve countrywide as a well-knit unit with great dedication and loyalty in performing the important functions of the Post Office. They deserve recognition not only for this but also more understanding on those few occasions when things go wrong at one of the thousands of points of contact with the public.</p>

<p>In particular I should like to mention the names of top management&#x2014;the Postmaster General, Mr. Henry Bester, and the three Deputy Postmasters General, Mr. Rudie Raath, Mr. De Klerk and Mr Ridgard, who received me courteously as Minister responsible for Posts and Telecommunications.</p>

<p>They are at the head of a very large business organisation that must be efficiently and ably managed in accordance with business standards. Together we have already developed into a team whose aim is to do only the best for the whole department, its staff, the public and our beautiful country, the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now lay upon the Table&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure of the Department of Posts and Telecommunications for the year ending 31 March 1984 [R.P. 11&#x2014;&#x2019;83].</block>

<speech by="#widman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. B. WIDMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to take this, my first, opportunity of congratulating the hon. the Minister on his appointment to this portfolio. I wish him well. I hope he will be successful in this portfolio, and that his success will also extend to the Post Office as a whole so that the country will be able to benefit as a result. This hon. Minister is the fourth Minister since 1977 whom we have had the pleasure of listening to while delivering his budget speech. The complex technological advancement of the Department of Posts and Telecommunications, I believe, can only progress in an atmosphere of stability.</p>

<p>I should also like to thank the hon. the Minister in my personal capacity for the courtesies he has extended to me and to my group. Above all, I want to thank him for the comprehensive and detailed survey of his department which he has given us here today. May I, on behalf of the PFP, associate myself with the remarks concerning the staff of the Post Office Administration, including Mr. Bester and his Directors, as well as the entire staff who, I believe, should be commended for their loyalty and devoted service to this department.</p>

<p>This year&#x2019;s budget, Mr. Speaker, is indeed a record budget in the sense that it reveals an overall increase of something like R400 million or 16,8%. Revenue has increased by 23,9% above that of last year. The capital expenditure of the Post Office has increased by 20,5% above that of last year. In that sense it is of course a record budget. The Post Office, however, is able to control and to regulate its budget when necessary, and <span class="col_3061-3062" refersTo="page_1559"/>we do expect its monetary requirements to rise from year to year as it expands. It is therefore no surprise that the Post Office finds itself in its present position. It is encouraging to know, however, that we have kept pace with the technological and electronic improvements, and that we have also kept pace with international developments in the world of telecommunications.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister has said, the Department of Posts and Telecommunications also provides a modern, adequate digital network to carry the vast streams of voice, text, data, and video traffic generated by each section of society, including the demands which are in fact made by the Government as well as by the private sector. Although the hon. the Minister has not referred to it, we know about the announcement of the intended investigation into the possibility of the provision of three satellites. This will of course require very, very careful consideration before we decide to commit ourselves to this principle because, no doubt, if we do we will certainly exceed the R200 million limit that has been estimated for this purpose. However, Sir, I am alarmed that in spite of this being the first budget the hon. the Minister has presented to this House, the hon. the Minister thought to emulate his predecessor who made an extra-parliamentary announcement on 5 January prior to his budget speech. This hon. Minister did exactly the same thing on 11 February this year when he announced increases of 14,6% of the total estimated revenue. He is now seeking to extract a further R270 million from the public of South Africa and by so doing promote the inflation rate that much further. I want to express the strongest protest and objection of the official Opposition to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s announcement. I base these objections on four grounds which I shall mention very briefly.</p>

<p>Firstly, we object to the fact that this statement was an extra-Parliamentary statement. I am happy to see that the hon. the Minister has shown a twinge of conscience in this regard today and I want to express the hope that he will not do this sort of thing again because it does in fact render the debate in this regard sterile.</p>

<p>Our second objection is that the tariff increases are too high. The figure of 14,6% to which I have referred, is a misleading one in the sense that it does not relate to the tariff increases themselves but to the revenue. I say this because the tariff increase in regard to the postage rate, for example, amounted to 25%. If one takes it from 1 April of last year to 1 April of this year one finds that the increase has been 100%. In addition, the unit charges in respect of telephones have gone up by 16% and the installation charges for telephones have been increased by 50%.</p>

<p>Our third objection to the statement is the fact that the statement itself is inflationary and has come at a time when the Government should be doing everything in its power to curb inflation. The statement was therefore ill-timed. The hon. the Prime Minister had something to say about the increase in the Escom tariffs and also in regard to petrol prices increases. These increases were then postponed. I say again that the statement itself is inflationary because it does set off a chain reaction, the end result of which is that John Citizen will have to pay and the inflation ball, which is the enemy of the economy, will continue to bounce higher and higher.</p>

<p>Our fourth objection is the fact that there appears to be very little consideration given in this announcement to alternate means of financing that could have been exploited and explained. These increases affect the whole of commerce and industry and I believe that I have the support of the whole of commerce and industry when I express our opposition to these increases. In addition, as I have already said, such an extra-Paliamentary statement does render debate sterile in the sense that the hon. the Minister does not have to motivate those increases or deal with the merits of the increases themselves. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will be prepared during the course of this debate to lend an ear to representations made to him not only by hon. members on this side of the House but also by representatives of commerce and industry to review and if necessary withdraw the tariff increases that have already been announced. If those tariff increases are in fact a <i>fait accompli</i> then what in fact he has done is to remove the Prince and leave us with a Hamlet. I do find it puzzling, however, that the hon. the Minister made this announcement after having announced only a few days before that he had come to an agreement with the staff association <span class="col_3063-3064" refersTo="page_1560"/>of the Post Office to the effect they would not be receiving any increases in salaries. I should like to know whether the hon. the Minister had disclosed to them at that stage that he intended increasing tariffs because, if he did not, I think he will have caused Parliament and the Government grave embarrassment in that the staff associations were not informed that these tariff increases were to be effected.</p>

<p>In regard to the entire financial structure of the Post Office and with regard to the financing of capital expenditure from the operating surplus I believe that the time has come for the whole financial structuring of the Post Office to be investigated as well as ensuring that every effort is made to increase productivity.</p>

<p>I believe that the debate on this budget that lies ahead of us will give us the opportunity to examine all these aspects, and therefore I wish to move at this stage&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the debate be now adjourned.</block>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 5:</p>

<speech by="#hulley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. R. HULLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the two amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) On page 4, in lines 18 and 19, to omit &#x201C;Prospecting or mining shall be undertaken in a park only&#x201D; and to substitute:</block>

<p>No prospecting or mining of any nature shall be undertaken on any land included in a park except</p>

<block name="quote">(2) on page 4, after line 27, to add:</block>

<block name="quote">: Provided that any mining or prospecting undertaken in terms of paragraph (a) or (b) may only be undertaken after an environment impact study has been undertaken in respect thereof and subject to the methods to be applied and the limitations and restoration requirements applicable in respect thereof being prescribed by regulation.</block>

<p>The amendments will firstly confirm the legislature&#x2019;s firm intention to prohibit prospecting and mining in existing parks. The second amendment will give the Minister the necessary power to commission environmental impact assessments. He will also have the power to make controlling regulations to limit the means and methods which are to be employed in cases where prospecting and mining in future parks may be proposed.</p>

<p>The first amendment will also allay our fears and remove any danger that a future court may misinterpret present intentions regarding the inviolability of existing parks.</p>

<p>I should like to use this opportunity to react briefly to the hon. Minister&#x2019;s reply to the Second Reading debate. He made certain comments on the question of mining in the Kruger National Park and the coking coal deposits which are found there. First of all I want to say that I warmly welcome his absolute reassurance that only Parliament can authorize any mining of the coking coal in the Kruger National Park. I am concerned, however, by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s further reference to the matter when he said, according to his uncorrected Hansard, that assuming there are these deposits which the Division of Geological Survey has confirmed, the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As daar wel sulke afsettings is en die Regering kom na die Parlement vir toe-stemming om daardie kookssteenkool te ontgin, sal hy dit onmoontlik kan doen tensy hy vergoedende grond vir daardie grond in die park gee. Daar sal dus &#x2019;n uitruiling van grond moet wees. Ons sal beslis <span class="col_3065-3066" refersTo="page_1561"/>nie grond aan &#x2019;n park onttrek vir mynbou nie tensy ons vergoedende grond vir die park gee.</block>

<p>I should like to cross swords with the hon. the Minister on this issue. I hope the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s remarks do not reflect his considered view, otherwise the conservationist community will regard him as being soft on mining coking coal in the Kruger National Park. I am talking about the Pafuri region of the park. I say this because the Pafuri region where the coking coal occurs is unique. It cannot simply be substituted for a piece of land of a similar size somewhere else in the vicinity. The area where the coking coal deposits occur is the confluence of a number of different ecosystems of Africa. The Wildlife Society says that there are no less than nine biomes that come together in that part of the Kruger National Park. It includes forests and sand-veld vegetation. It is an area with spectacular scenery where unique plant communities are found and wide varieties of animal species occur. It is also an area rich in archaeological interest. Furthermore, it has been shown that if this part of the park were excised&#x2014;and let us say it is some 5% of the total land area of the park&#x2014;it would affect far more than only 5% of the species that occur in the park. Let me refer the hon. the Minister to a symposium that was held at UCT in September 1980, jointly sponsored in conjunction with the Nature Foundation, a symposium in which this point was made about the effect that such a simple swopping of land would have. Furthermore, mining in the park would introduce complementary infrastructure such as roads, townships, offices, pipelines, power lines, etc., which would affect more than only the area that one might propose to mine. I say that to ever mine in the Pafuri region of the Kruger Park, would be to cash in our national heritage for a mess of pottage. The Kruger National Park must be treated as sacrosanct so that future generations can also enjoy it, particularly that part of it. It is precisely for these reasons, and because there might also be genuinely unique parts of future Parks which should similarly never be ruined&#x2014;and I quoted the example of Langebaan Lagoon yesterday, which is a pertinent example as it is likely to be, together with its surrounding wetlands, part of the West Coast National Park&#x2014;that we believe that it is important that the hon. the Minister should accept the proposal we have made in the second amendment, i.e. to give the hon. the Minister and the department the power to commission environmental impact assessments. That is the only way one will be able to identify those parts which are genuinely unique and which should be protected against the claims of any kind of exploitation, as opposed to those parts which could well be substituted or interchangeable with other parts.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_environment_affairs_and_fisheries">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT AFFAIRS AND FISHERIES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before coming to specific arguments I should just like to set straight a remark by the hon. member concerning what I am reported to have said in my Second Reading speech. My intention was to give the hon. member the absolute assurance that we are not, in the first place, going to allow mining activities in the existing parks without obtaining parliamentary approval for doing so. In addition, I told the hon. member how strongly Parliament felt about the issue that should Parliament, for strategic reasons, decide that the mining of certain strategic minerals should in fact take place, the Government should offer compensatory land. I have a great deal of sympathy with what the hon. member said about the ecology of the particular area. I know that it is in the most northerly part of the Kruger National Park. However, I do not believe that it will be necessary in my or his lifetime to mine that coking coal there. What I actually intended to do was to emphasize the point and give the hon. member the assurance that we would not allow any mining activities or even prospecting in the existing park. I think he understands what I mean. It was actually just an extra assurance to him that we would not do it.</p>

<p>I have no problems with the hon. member&#x2019;s first amendment. I am prepared to accept it because it merely says what we wish to say ourselves, albeit in other words. Therefore I have no problem with the hon. member&#x2019;s first amendment.</p>

<p>&#x2020; As regards the second amendment, I considered it very carefully. What the hon. member has in mind is to make environmental <span class="col_3067-3068" refersTo="page_1562"/>impact studies compulsory before prospecting or mining activities can take place in the new category of national parks provided for in this Bill. I cannot find fault with the object the hon. member has in mind. I think we all feel very strongly about not spoiling our environment. I maintain, however, that adequate provision for these matters has already been made in the regulations promulgated under section 12 of the Mines and Works Act, Act No. 27 of 1956.</p>

<p>Allow me, Sir, briefly to read a few extracts from these regulations. I quote from regulation 5.11(d)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Opencast mine&#x201D; means a mine including prospecting operations and any hole, trench or other excavation made in the course of prospecting operations, where a mineral deposit is or has been worked at or from the surface of the earth after removal of the overburden.</block>

<p>Regulation 5.12.1 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A layout plan and a rehabilitation programme as well as such other relevant information as may be reasonably required by the Inspector of Mines, shall on request be submitted in respect of an opencast mine to the Inspector of Mines.</block>

<p>Regulation 5.12.2 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Rehabilitation of the surface at any opencast mine shall form an integral part of the mining operations and shall, as far as is practicable, be conducted concurrently with such operations and, where applicable, in accordance with a programme laid down by the Inspector of Mines after consultation with the manager and approved by the Government Mining Engineer.</block>

<p>Regulation 5.13 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No encroachment on the environment or despoliation of the surface in any manner whatsoever shall take place or be allowed to take place outside the area, which, in the opinion of the Government Mining Engineer, is actually required for prospecting, mining or a works and such area shall at all times be confined to the minimum compatible with the efficient operation of such prospecting, mine or works.</block>

<p>Regulation 5.13.1 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No dumping or impounding of rubble, litter, garbage, rubbish or discards of any description, whether solid or liquid, shall take place elsewhere than at the site or sites demarcated for the purpose by the manager with the approval of the Inspector of Mines. Every such site shall be limited to a minimum and every dump or dam shall be so controlled to ensure that the evironment is, as far as practicable, not polluted.</block>

<p>Regulation 5.13.2 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In every case where vegetation, including trees, shrubs or grasses, has been disturbed for purposes such as the making of access roads, the clearing of sites for stockpiles and the erection of plant or other installations, such vegetation shall be re-established to the satisfaction of the Inspector of Mines. The inspector of Mines may, with the approval of the Government Mining Engineer, introduce a programme according to which rehabilitation shall be done.</block>

<p>Regulation 5.13.3 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When prospecting for or recovery of a mineral finally ceases and when the operations finally cease at any works or the prospecting rights or mining titles or contracts held cease to exist, the owner or manager shall cause to be demolished all buildings, walls, foundations, dams, swimming pools, posts or other structures or installations, including pipelines and private railway lines laid on the surface of the land, where such operations were conducted and shall ensure the removal or the disposal of the rubble resulting from the demolition thereof and the rehabilitation of the surface to as near to its natural state as is practicable, to the satisfaction of the Inspector of Mines.</block>

<p>Having read all these regulations under the Act, I am of the opinion that, if I should accept this amendment, it would entail unnecessary <span class="col_3069-3070" refersTo="page_1563"/>duplication of existing regulations. I am told, further, that these regulations are enforced very harshly on any owner of a mine and, whether prospecting or mining takes place within these parks or outside of them, the mine owner will have to adhere to these regulations.</p>

<p>It is also obvious that during negotiations between the owner and the Parks Board these issues will be discussed fully and will form an integral part of the final contract. For these reasons&#x2014;I am sure the hon. member will grant me the argument&#x2014;I cannot, unfortunately, accept the amendment proposed by him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#theunissen">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. M. THEUNISSEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think it is a good thing that the hon. the Minister is accepting the first leg of the amendment. The amendment is quite positively phrased. It has the same legal effect as the wording of the present clause. I agree with the hon. the Minister that we cannot accept the second leg of the amendment of the hon. member. When one looks at it one sees that it imposes curbs and restrictions on the Minister&#x2019;s powers to negotiate. We must bear in mind that we shall now be dealing with a category 2 property which must be obtained by means of negotiation. If we were to introduce the restriction moved by the hon. member in his amendment, we would be restricting the Minister&#x2019;s powers to negotiate. This would hamper him in his performance of the task we are in fact contemplating, which is to obtain additional properties. In my opinion that is sufficient reason for us to be unable to support the second leg of the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hardingham">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. W. HARDINGHAM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we want to make it clear that we support the first part of the amendment of the hon. member for Constantia. But we have difficulty in supporting the second leg of his amendment. As the hon. the Minister has explained adequate provision and safeguards, of the issues raised in this part of the amendment, exist in the Mines and Works Act. We are quite satisfied that these particular aspects is well covered. It must be made clear&#x2014;and I think the hon. the Minister has a good appreciation of this particular fact&#x2014;that there is very grave concern and strong feeling with regard to any suggestions that any mining whatsoever should take place in existing national parks.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#goodall">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. B. GOODALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let me explain our problem to the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister pointed out that there is a lot which the Inspector of Mines can in fact do. I appreciate that. However, our problem is that we believe that that authority should rest with the hon. the Minister of Environment Affairs and Fisheries. Surely he has a greater interest in protecting the environment than, say, the mining engineer. Let me refer hon. members to the problems we had in regard to the Kruger National Park five years ago. At that stage everybody was telling us how essential it was to have the coking coal of the Kruger National Park. If environmentalists campaign against it they are accused of being emotional about the issue, but if industrialists say they need the coal then it is just hard economic fact. As the hon. member Mr. Theunissen and the hon. member for Mooi River have pointed out there could actually be complications in implementing the second leg of the amendment of the hon. member for Constantia. However, we want to say to the hon. the Minister that possibly the department&#x2014;I am sure they have the same interest as we have&#x2014;could look at the intent of our amendment and see if at a later stage it cannot be implented in some way or another. They might have to be able to come back to the House with an amendment that could cover that intention. I think the present amendment perhaps does not tag on too well to clause 5.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hulley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. R. HULLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should just like to add my own comments to those made by the hon. member for Edenvale. What will happen in the present circumstances if there should be a conflict between the Department of Mines and the Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs in regard to the application of the very impressive powers of the hon. the Minister of Energy Affairs? The hon. the Minister of Environment Affairs and Fisheries will not have the power to have the last word in regard to a park which falls under his authority. We are trying to give the hon. the Minister the powers we think he might need to resolve a conflict between the two departmerits. <span class="col_3071-3072" refersTo="page_1564"/>Ministers normally welcome extra power; so it is interesting that this hon. Minister is declining the offer.</p>

<p>Sir, I think we have made the point. According to my interpretation of the National Parks Act, which gives power to make regulations on any matter not specified in the existing schedule of regulations about which regulations can be made, the Minister does not have the power to make regulations relating to mining in future parks, and he is going to need such power. I think it is absolutely indisputable that he should have the power to say what may or may not happen in parks that fall under his control. It may well be that this particular amendment to clause 5&#x2014;we have no other option in terms of the rules&#x2014;may be misplaced, but I would nevertheless like to plead with the hon. the Minister to take our point and to consider bringing a further amendment at some stage to give him the power under the schedule of regulations to do what we are asking him to do in terms of our amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_environment_affairs_and_fisheries">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT AFFAIRS AND FISHERIES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I just say that I do not doubt the <i>bona fides</i> of hon. members as regards their amendment! However, I just want to follow up what the hon. member Mr. Theunissen and the hon. member for Mooi River said. We must be careful not to bind ourselves absolutely as regards regulations and the making of regulations. At this stage very sensitive negotiations with people are in progress in regard to mineral rights. We must therefore be careful not to wreck negotiations as a result of additional burdens which can be placed on the owner of such a farm. That is all I am afraid of. I want to give hon. members the assurance that in negotiations conducted by the Parks Board with the owners of land&#x2014;the Parks Board is undertaking the negotiations on behalf of the department&#x2014; all these matters will naturally be discussed very thoroughly, and it will be pointed out to the owner of the land that there are very strict regulations in connection with mining and prospecting.</p>

<p>If one considers clause 2, which has already been accepted, the proposed subsection (2)(a) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Declare any other area, including land&#x2014;</block>

<p>In other words, what this actually means, is that agreement must be reached with the Minister. What I therefore want to say is that the matters raised by hon. members must of necessity be covered by the contract which is eventually entered into with the owner.

Even if the contract only contains one clause stating that he is subject to the Mines and Works Act, he is automatically also subject to the regulations.</p>

<p>I can give hon. members the assurance that if in future we experience problems we shall definitely return to this House for the necessary amendments. In the interim we must see how this legislation works in practice. I am quite convinced that we shall not experience any problems in this regard, and I say this because the people with whom we are negotiating set as much store by conserving the environment as we do. That is why it is my standpoint that in the initial stages, at any rate, we shall not experience any problems, but if we do experience problems we shall return to this House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the tradition is that at the Third Reading we look at the implications of a Bill. I regard the Bill which we are now discussing as very important, and as such we should not let it go through this stage without looking at the implications flowing from it and without looking at the objectives we would like to achieve by means of it.</p>

<p>In the first instance the Bill makes it possible for more land to be made available for national parks. That is to be welcomed, because, as the hon. member for Constantia pointed out, only 2,4% of land area of South Africa is set aside for national parks. The second object of this Bill is to try to preserve certain species of animals, species which at the present moment are being threatened with extinction. In South Africa we have already seen the disappearance of the Cape Zebra, the blue buck and the Cape lion. Let us look at the two species which are mentioned in this Bill, species which are in a very threatened situation. We know that whereas in areas of the Transvaal the black rhino were fairly common at one stage in the early 1970s the Transvaal had to import black rhino from Natal. Then there was also a gift from Rhodesia of a further 12 rhino; so that a rhino herd is again beginning to build up. And it is not only in South Africa that this species is being threatened. Let us have a look at Africa. It was estimated that in 1970 there were approximately 200 000 rhino in East Africa; today there are only about 20 000. So South Africa has an important role to play in this field. Look at Asia. It has been estimated that there are only 2 000 rhino left in Asia. One of the reasons for this state of affairs is of course poaching. There has been tremendous poaching, particularly of rhino horn, which it is said is a better investment than gold. I am told that the cost of rhino horn, powdered rhino horn, is at the moment in excess of R300 an ounce.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>What is it being used for?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#goodall">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. B. GOODALL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, without wishing to encourage the hon. member for Sandton to go poaching rhino, let me tell him that powdered rhino horn is used in the Middle East as an aphrodisiac, in China for fever and in Yemen for ceremonial daggers. Such daggers can cost up to R1 000. It is interesting to note that in Yemen is that the authorities there have now banned the importation of rhino horn. A similar situation exists in regard to elephant tusks. It was estimated that in 1976 about 50 000 elephants were killed just for their tusks. That means that about 4% of the total elephant population of Africa is being eliminated year by year. If one considers the high mortality rate amongst elephants, a rate of about 7% per annum, one can see to what extent elephants are being threatened with extinction. It is therefore encouraging to note that it has been estimated that the number of elephants killed for their tusks in 1980 was something like 37 000. This shows that something can be done. So this legislation is to be welcomed in that it is taking steps to protect those two species particularly.</p>

<p>But this debate has achieved <i>a</i> third objective, something just as important, if not more important, than the other, and that is that we received the categorical assurance from the hon. the Minister that he would not allow mining in the Kruger National Park without coming to Parliament first. We welcome that assurance. Such an assurance is necessary because this question tends to come up time and time again. During the Committee Stage I made the point that five years ago one thought that it would not be possible to live without the coal in the Kruger National Park but then suddenly we seemed to have found other resources so that we do not need that coal anymore. The point is that if we had gone ahead with mining coal in the Kruger National Park we would have had an ecological disaster on our hands, because that particular area of the Kruger National Park is unique. That particular area cannot be replaced because it is the meeting point of nine major African ecosystems. There are things there that are unique to Africa in the way of forests and woodlands. These things are not found anywhere else in Africa. The high mopani woodlands are found only there. In addition there are species of fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals there which cannot be found anywhere else. So if we had actually allowed that mining to take place, it would have been a disaster. You see, Mr. Speaker, extinction takes place in nature, and we can never protect all species for ever and ever. <span class="col_3075-3076" refersTo="page_1566"/>But the interesting thing is that when extinction takes place in nature it is normally replaced by something more dynamic, something more vital, something better adapted to the environment. But where extinction takes place by man, all we leave is a void. At the moment little is known about how our natural systems operate, and I believe it is essential that we preserve it as a living laboratory from which we can learn to come to terms with the environment because, Mr. Speaker, if we cannot come to terms with our environment, how can we hope to come to terms with one another?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. T. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I fully agree with the constructive comments made by the hon. member for Edenvale. One of the implications of this legislation would certainly be that more land would become available for national parks. This Bill will also give the National Parks Board more flixibility in their activities in that additional parks other than pristine national parks can also now be developed. Therefore a flexibility is now being built into the approach of the National Parks Board.</p>

<p>*The effect of the legislation under discussion will be that the National Parks Board will be given the powers to apply management and control in practice. This will give them a flexibility of action so that they can negotiate with neighbouring land owners in accordance with normal contractual principles. In this way national parks can be enlarged without a great deal of capital expenditure necessarily being incurred. One case in which this concept can be applied very fruitfully&#x2014;and I want to suggest this to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;is that of the Addo Elephant Park, near Port Elizabeth. Last year the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central made a very well-argued appeal here for that national park to be enlarged. I should like to support him in this. In this case there are approximately ten land-owners who own land in an area which could possibly afford access to and form a link between the present national park and the Suurberg Forest Reserve. If such a link could be achieved, this would have major cost-saving implications for the National Parks Board. The area I am now referring to covers approximately 45 000 ha. I therefore sincerely hope that in view of the measures now being placed at his disposal, the hon. the Minister will give this matter priority, for other very practical reasons as well.</p>

<p>The Addo Elephant Park is already an internationally recognized park. It is situated close to Port Elizabeth and offers excellent facilities for tourists. The park is also easily accessible to reach by air and sea. This will also be meeting an urgent need, and at the same time a conservation problem will be solved, because it will give sanctuary to the elephants in that national park. There are already too many elephants for the available space in the park. The same also applies to the buffaloes and the mountain zebras.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I withdraw it. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>We shall also be able to check the deterioration of the flora in the park which is occurring now due to over-grazing. With the power now being vested in the hon. the Minister, after obtaining the forest area he will be able to negotiate with the owners of the corridor with a view to linking the present national park with this area I have just referred to. Then the Eastern Province will have a national park of real stature, and this, of course, will be a major boost for the tourist industry in the Eastern Cape.</p>

<p>In order to eliminate every possible misunderstanding, I just want to point out that landowners adjoining the forest reserve area can in future be involved by way of negotiation. <span class="col_3077-3078" refersTo="page_1567"/>For this reason I just want it placed on record that for the past eight years I have in fact had a share in a piece of land bordering on the forest reserve.</p>

<p>The amendment embodied in clause 8 is a tremendous step forward in the direction of the rationalization of matters within the administration of the National Parks Board. Everything points to the hon. the Deputy Minister, together with the hon. the Minister, intending to extend the seaward boundary of the Tsitsikamma National Park and thereby establishing a full-fledged marine park there too. The park and the lakes area can therefore now be managed as a unit, which is both logical and practical. This step, the result of this legislation, will also, of course, put an end to fragmentary control in that area. Of course this also strengthens the cause of decentralization at the operating level. In my opinion effective managment now requires an administration centre for the National Parks Board&#x2019;s southern parks, viz. the Addo Elephant Park, the Mountain Zebra Park, the Karoo Park, the Bontebok Park, and now also the Tsitsikamma Park and the Lakes area. These parks will only be able to come into their own if such a decision regarding decentralization is taken. It will then be possible to evaluate and deal with immediate regional requirements on the spot.</p>

<p>Last year I suggested that George seemed a very good choice. Now, with the inclusion of the Lakes area, we can definitely make good use of some of their buildings and other infrastructure for such a centre.</p>

<p>I personally believe that the most important amendment here is the amendment to section 30 of Act No. 57 of 1976. This amendment paves the way for the decision to extend the seaward boundary of the Tsitsikamma National Park by deleting the present restriction of 1,8 km. The Parks Board has addressed representations with regard to this extension, to extend the seaward boundary to five km, since 1977. This will mean that this beautiful park will in future be a full-fledged marine park in terms of international standards. I do not think anyone has worked harder for this than Dr. Robertson, the present head of the southern parks. I have also campaigned for this and I still feel that the park&#x2019;s seaward boundary should be six miles seaward of the shore. I suspect that the hon. the Minister may initially consider three sea miles, but I feel that the eventual aim and endeavour should be six sea miles.</p>

<p>I should like to express my thanks and appreciation to the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister for their extremely sympathetic approach to this major conservation effort. The hon. the Deputy Minister specially visited this area and the park to acquaint himself fully with circumstances there. Over the years the Fisheries Department has been strongly opposed to the idea of extending the seaward boundary. It is extremely encouraging that a change in their attitude can now be perceived. Perhaps this is due to the beneficial effect the new hon. Minister and hon. Deputy Minister have had on the department. In my opinion this decision is one of the most important conservation decisions in many years, and it will definitely do a great deal to enhance our country&#x2019;s international prestige as far as conservation matters are concerned.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it would be superfluous to congratulate the hon. the Minister on his promotion at this juncture. However, that does not prevent me from congratulating the hon. the Minister on the first piece of legislation he has already virtually piloted through this Parliament so ably and with so much ease&#x2014; one is tempted to say, with so much grace.</p>

<p>We have come to the Third Reading of this fine, important and, I feel, essential Bill. In considering its effect and application, I want to refer briefly to what I consider to be the crux of the legislation. Yesterday the hon. the Minister said, and quite rightly too, that only about 12% of South Africa&#x2019;s agricultural land is high potential agricultural land. It is also general knowledge that South Africa is not really an agricultural country; it is rather an industrial and mining country. Having said this, I want to mention the exceptional achievements of the South African farmers and soil conservationists&#x2014;and they are also the farmers&#x2014;who are known for having made the Republic of South Africa the food larder of Africa. By saying this I am, by implication, trying to say how important the Bill is, because it provides that in future mining will only be undertaken in existing parks by way of exception, by way of necessity and when Parliament deems it <span class="col_3079-3080" refersTo="page_1568"/>necessary. It is only in such cases that Parliament will allow the Minister to give permission for mining to be undertaken in existing parks. Because our agricultural land is scarce, I foresee that in the future we shall not be able to use agricultural land for parks arbitrarily. This will be virtually impossible. That is why I consider the protection this legislation is going to afford to existing parks to be so essential, because the Bill provides that mining cannot be undertaken in the parks unless this is consented to by the Parliament.</p>

<p>For me as a farmer the Bill is like a double-barrel shotgun&#x2014;it fires two shots. The second shot in the double-barrel shotgun is that whereas legislation at present provides that no mining may be undertaken in existing parks, this Bill provides that in exceptional cases the Minister can approach Parliament and Parliament can give its consent for mining to be undertaken. Why do I regard this as so important? Let us assume, as an extreme example, that rich oil reserves are discovered under the Kruger National Park and at some stage the oil supply to South Africa is totally cut off. In terms of existing legislation oil cannot be mined in the Kruger National Park. However, in terms of the legislation as it will read in the future, the Minister can approach this Parliament and by way of exception, this Parliament can consent to mining operations being undertaken.</p>

<p>That is why I take such pleasure in supporting the Third Reading of this Bill on behalf of hon. members on this side. We want to tell the hon. the Minister and his department that we hope and trust that in future they will be most successful in the implementation and handling of this legislation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hardingham">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. W. HARDINGHAM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in supporting the Third Reading of this legislation, I want to say that one aspect has become very clear throughout this debate and that is the awareness that has been apparent on all sides of this House of the importance of our environment and the conservation of that environment. In this legislation we are witnessing a desirable concept which was given birth to by the commission of inquiry into environmental legislation. It became clear from this Report that there was a need to streamline many aspects of the functions of the National Parks Board and also to rationalize and eliminate as far as possible various aspects of duplication.</p>

<p>I think that one of the most important points that we must look at in the future is that, in terms of this legislation which is in its final stages, the National Parks Board will now be able to expand in areas which provide a greater diversification from what may be regarded as the conventional type of park or reserve. This country is blessed with a variety of ecosystems, and we now have a unique opportunity of exploiting these to a great extent. In the planning of future nature conservation areas, it is important to move away from a stereotyped style that exists in many of the present reserves.</p>

<p>In conclusion, therefore, I think we can say generally that this legislation has opened the door for the acquisition of land for incorporation into Parks Board areas which hitherto was not possible. Therefore, we are looking forward to an era of expansion which can only be of considerable benefit to the concept of conservation and in particular to the future growth of our national parks.</p>

<speech by="#geldenhuys">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. GELDENHUYS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is unanimity on this legislation, for which one is grateful, because it is an important piece of legislation which we believe will be of great benefit to South Africa and its people in future. This amending Bill will result in certain lake areas being transferred to the National Parks Board. I should like to concentrate on this aspect and on the effects this legislation will have on it.</p>

<p>It is desirable for the lake areas as established by the Lake Areas Development Act of 1975 to be under the control of the National Parks Board. This is a further step towards the functional rationalization of the public sector. Both the Lake Areas Development Board and the National Parks Board seek to control, manage, preserve and develop God&#x2019;s gift to mankind, viz. nature, which in itself is sufficient reason to combine the duties of these two bodies, to rationalize two bodies engaged in realizing the same objects in the same way. Lagoons, lakes and marshes and limited areas fed by tidal rivers are rare phenomena in the Republic. It is therefore of national importance that this extremely valuable heritage be preserved for posterity. It is necessary for affective steps to <span class="col_3081-3082" refersTo="page_1569"/>be taken by the Government, not only to preserve this heritage, but also to make provision for the orderly and co-ordinated development and utilization of South Africa&#x2019;s lake areas because this also forms part of the conservation effort.</p>

<p>The meaningful utilization of tidal rivers, lagoons and marshes along the South African coastal area has been the subject of various investigations undertaken by the Subsidiary Commitee for Coastal Areas of the Planning Advisory Council to the hon. the Prime Minister. At present that committee is an advisory committee to the hon. the Minister of Environment Affairs and Fisheries. Their investigations proved very clearly that the vast majority of aquatic areas along the South African coastline have reached an advanced stage of deterioration, mainly as a result&#x2014;in the first place&#x2014;of the silting up of lagoons, lakes and marshes and tidal rivers. It is interesting just to mention here that before there was control over the methods of dealing with silted up river estuaries, it frequently happened that conflicting interests led to two different bull-dozers working at a river estuary simultaneously. One was blocking and the other unblocking the estuary because people farming on the flood plains wanted that land drained of water, whereas other people with other interests wanted the water to remain there. [Interjections.] The judicious blocking and unblocking of these river estuaries is in fact a very important control measure when it comes to this kind of conservation of the lake areas. Incidental and unco-ordinated development around these water areas creates problems and has to be controlled. Pollution by waste products as a result of the erection of houses, hotels and the like is a problem at such lake areas. The injudicious utilization of aquatic surfaces and surrounding flood plains is also creating problems. The undesirable erection of structures, the uncontrolled siting of buildings, etc. is disrupting systems such as these.</p>

<p>One of the basic control problems lies in the multiple jurisdiction of various State departments. I have been told that there are no less than 26 Acts that have been established by at least 10 Government departments and statutory organizations to administer, govern or regulate these problems. This causes quite a number of problems, e.g. divergent policies, fragmented planning without the necessary ongoing consultation between the various bodies, divergent and inconsistent advice by departments to the various development organizations, etc. We found that as a result of all these problems it was necessary to establish the Lake Areas Development Board. The Government did this in terms of the Lake Areas Development Act which was passed by this House in 1975 and this made it possible to combine all these problems and place them under the thorough and consistent control of one body.</p>

<p>Since this Lake Areas Development Board is now transferring its functions to the Parks Board, it is my pleasant duty to thank these gentlemen, who wrestled with and overcame these problems and dealt with this matter until it could be taken over today by the Parks Board, most sincerely on behalf of this House and South Africa. I am thinking in particular of the first chairman, Mr. F. J. M. Botha, and his successor, Mr. G. A. Visser, who is the present chairman of the Lake Areas Development Board.</p>

<p>Since this board&#x2019;s task is being taken over, we shall have an entirely new set-up under the control of the National Parks Board. What we have here is not merely a park surrounded by a fence with gates through which the public is allowed to enter the park to study wild animals or any other aspect of ecology. This is an area in which people live, in which there are hotels and in which people earn a living. People use the lakes for waterskiing, for motorboating and yachting, etc. It therefore also creates the infrastructure for a recreational area and a holiday resort which must attract tourists to South Africa. One therefore wants to ask that when this new kind of national park is taken over care will be taken to ensure that the interests of the people living there, will be fully and fairly protected; that decisions on domestic issues will not only be taken by the Parks Board, but that the local inhabitants will have a say and that there will be joint decision-making between them and the Parks Board.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all the hon. members for this discussion. I want to reiterate that it was a very pleasant discussion. I share the view of the hon. member for Mooi River that hon. <span class="col_3083-3084" refersTo="page_1570"/>members of all parties clearly realise the importance of our environment. I think that that was clear throughout the discussion. I also share the sentiments of the hon. member for Edenvale about our endangered species. I want to pay tribute to all the people who are busy protecting ur endangered species&#x2014;-and I refer not only to animal species, but also to our bird species and especially to our plant species. I think it is absolutely necessary that we should bear this in mind at all times.</p>

<p>*I should also like to thank the hon. member for Uitenhage. This hon. member made a major contribution with regard to the Tsitsikamma Marine Reserve. He also knows a great deal about it. If there has ever been a place where I have felt close to heaven, it was there. When one walks along the Otter Trail from Nature&#x2019;s Valley through the beautiful surroundings to the Storms River, one feels that this is the closest one can get to one&#x2019;s Creator.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Uitenhage undertook a very thorough study of the parks of America at his own expense, and I want to thank him for doing so. I think he acquired a great deal of knowledge in the process.</p>

<p>I also want to thank the hon. member for Meyerton for his contribution at a late stage of the debate. Once again this was a contribution which, as we could all see, came from the bottom of his heart and attested to his love of nature and the environment.</p>

<p>I also want to thank the hon. member for Swellendam for his contribution. As regards the matter of divided control, I want to tell him that a committee is being appointed by the Council for the Environment specifically in order to investigate this aspect of divided control along our coastline. We are going to try to place it under unified control, but one cannot rush into this matter. I am therefore pleased that the council for the Environment is investigating the matter.</p>

<p>I should like to return to the speeches made yesterday by the hon. member for Maitland and the hon. member for Virginia. Their speeches confirmed the remark I made yesterday, namely that hon. members in this House have a wide knowledge of matters connected with our environment and our national parks. I am extremely grateful for this. I should like to take this opportunity to say that the hon. the Deputy Minister and I shall welcome a discussion of this kind during the discussion of our Vote. I think it will be a continuation of what we have achieved here today. Many thanks to all hon. members for the calm discussion we were able to have.</p>

<p>I did. While you talked I sat quietly. We believe the police have got to search vehicles. There is just no other way that they can deal with the situation. However, I do want to take issue with the hon. the Minister on a point that arises out of recent tragic incidents. I believe that the police and their vehicles in setting up these roadblocks, provision for which is made in this Bill, must always be clearly identified. I think they must be seen to be what they are, i.e. roadblocks set up by the S.A. Police and then there can be no doubt in anybody&#x2019;s mind, because if roadblocks are set up by the police using unmarked cars and people in plain clothes we are going to have tragedy all over again. I do not think there is any South African who will stop for a person in an unmarked car, even if it is surrounded by a battery of lights, if that person is in plain clothes. I would not. It is worth more than my life is worth to do that. In the same way, if I was chased by people in an unmarked car wearing mufti or civilian clothes, I too would run for my life as I believe somebody did recently. So I believe that the police must always do what they do at Acacia Park when I drive through every night when I leave this Place.</p>

<p>What happens there is that one drives up to that gate and a policeman comes out and as he is wearing reflective material, he is clearly identifiable as a member of the S.A. Police. He does not have to tell you; your head-lamps tell you because it is clearly emblazoned across his chest. As I say, he wears the chevron design which clearly shows up and he has SAP written across his chest, so one knows exactly who he is and why he is there. I believe that people will then stop and submit themselves to whatever these frightful indignities are that the PFP seem to make such a noise about.</p>

<p>I want to say again that I do not believe that any citizen will object to having his vehicle searched if he has nothing to hide and I do not honestly believe that there is anything sinister in this provision at all. However, I do want to stress that when it comes to the individual, if these powers are sought in respect of the individual, then that would be an entirely different story. We in the NRP support the concept of the right of the police to search vehicles&#x2014;and I underline the word vehicles&#x2014;at a properly constructed roadblock in order to circumvent the possible crime of the smuggling of drugs, the smuggling of arms or whatever it may be that could affect the stability, the security and the safety of our State.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I agree 100% with what the hon. member for Umhlanga said about the PFP being soft on security matters. However, I shall refer to that again in due course.</p>

<p>As regards the question of the identification of police officers and other officers at road blocks, I believe that the hon. member made a good suggestion. As far as I know, it has always been the procedure that the police have identified themselves as clearly as possible at such road blocks. I agree with the hon. member that what we experience at Acacia Park is an outstanding example of this. Therefore I do not wish to argue with <span class="col_3087-3088" refersTo="page_1572"/>the hon. member for Umhlanga today. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to refer to an article in this morning&#x2019;s <i>Die Burger.</i> I feel that it would be very useful to refer to this in order to expose the whole <i>modus vivendi</i> of the PFP, their approach to principles such as patriotism, stability and the combating of crime, and the S.A. Police and the S.A. Defence Force. It can only show up their attitude to those organizations even more clearly. I wish to state clearly that I associate myself entirely with the statements made in this article in <i>Die Burger.</i> This article refers to the leftist heart, the leftist radical circles, and also expresses itself in very strong terms in respect of what the Black Sash have done, and in respect of the hiding places of the ANC in Maseru and the raid carried out on them there. The article also refers to the efforts of the PFP to condone that raid. I do not believe we need have any doubt about the loyalties of the PFP, particularly in view of the fact that the hon. member for Wynberg tried to identify himself with that raid and with the actions of the Defence Force. However, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made a feeble effort to dissociate himself from his party&#x2019;s spokesman on defence in this regard. In addition, Mr. Speaker &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cuyler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. CUYLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this particular newspaper article also mentions that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition struggled to dissociate himself to some extent from the standpoint of the hon. member for Wynberg. It is mentioned that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made no mention in his statement of the need for the attack, but only expressed criticism of the Defence Force and the Government. The approach of the PFP to this particular legislation also is typical of their approach to the actions of the Defence Force. Accordingly I really wonder whether what is said in this article is indeed so far removed from reality, particularly when one of their hon. members&#x2014;as the hon. member for Umhlanga also clearly stated&#x2014;associates himself wholeheartedly with the Black Sash with regard to matters such as, e.g., the actions of Swapo in Angola, and organizations hostile to South Africa. One wonders where hon. members of the PFP really stand. I believe that the hon. member for Yeoville agrees that its heart beats very weakly as far as patriotism is concerned, and that he will have to establish exactly where he stands in that party as well.</p>

<p>I believe that in the coming by-election in <span class="col_3089-3090" refersTo="page_1573"/>Waterkloof, hon. members of the PFP will have to take full cognizance of the fact that they are going to suffer a thrashing due to their actions and their lack of real patriotism, which is something one would expect of them. I say with all respect that these people are not interested in the combating of crime.</p>

<p>That is absolutely untrue.</p>

<speech by="#cuyler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. CUYLER</person>:</from>

<p>Let us consider the speech of the hon. member for Houghton for a moment. The hon. the Minister quoted certain statistics relating to road blocks, and the indications are that the success of the police in setting up road blocks is such that approximately 14% of those vehicles that are stopped are indeed involved in some form of crime. If those road blocks had not been there, I believe that that number of criminals would not have been rounded up. With respect, I wish to suggest that a true reasonable suspicion would not have occurred in respect of 14% of those 4 000 cases in which arrests took place. In my opinion, those hon. members are not interested in the real combating of crime. In her speech the hon. member for Houghton gave us a certain definition. She referred to the issue of accountability, a statutory accountability which, in terms of this definition of hers, which supposedly appears in this legislation, does not hold water at all as far as the present legal system is concerned. I find this shocking, She says that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The police will now not be accountable for any actions performed during searches or at roadblocks.</block>

<p>Surely that is the greatest untruth uttered in this House. How can the police not be held accountable for any action during roadblocks? This really is not true. If a police officer at a roadblock were to commit a murder, steal something from a vehicle, be guilty of assault or any action in conflict with the provisions of section 5 of the Police Act, then such a police officer could be charged in terms of the laws of this country. Therefore the statement of the hon. member for Houghton to the effect that the police will not be accountable for any actions performed during searches or at roadblocks, is a gross irregularity and really very wide of the mark.</p>

<p>She is content to state these half-truths for the world to hear, and she does not care where they are published. By using that kind of argument, the hon. members in that party are associating themselves with the enemies of South Africa. They are really not at all interested in the implementation of the law. It is essential for the due implementation of the law and the execution of the task of the police that it should be possible to search vehicles outside the area 10 km extending from the border as well, and, in the difficult times in which we are living, to confiscate arms, dagga, drugs and similar items. It is impossible for any police officer to have psychic contact with a specific approaching vehicle so as to develop a reasonable suspicion in this regard.</p>

<p>I have no hesitation whatsowever in supporting this legislation. In conclusion, I just wish to refer to the closing words of the hon. member for Houghton. She said that that party was impervious as far as these cases are concerned and regards &#x201C;this cry of total onslaught&#x201D; and &#x201C;lacking patriotism&#x201D;. They are impervious to that. Once again, according to them, the total onslaught on South Africa does not exist. The real need for a dragnet which is necessary in order to avert effectively the entry into the country of arms, drugs, etc. is something they fail to understand, and they do not support such security action. The longer that party attacks this kind of legislation with statements of that nature, the longer they will be shown up in the politics of this country as a party that cannot be supported and trusted by the electorate.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_law_and_order">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LAW AND ORDER</person>:</from> <p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Houghton has often in the past been called upon by the PFP to save poor innings on a sticky wicket. Yesterday was such an occasion. Unfortunately, however, she failed dismally. The hon. member completely missed the boat. I do not think that she really knows what it is all about.</p>

<p>*However, I must say that it was really a pleasant change to listen to the hon. member again as a spokesman on law and order. I should appreciate it a great deal if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition were rather to make her the leader of the team on his side <span class="col_3091-3092" refersTo="page_1574"/>instead of certain hon. members that he has in that team.</p>

<p>The hon. member said yesterday when she referred to the hon. member for Krugersdorp that he actually gave the real reason for this Bill before the House; not the reason that I gave, but the reason that the hon. member gave. When she said what the real reason was she quoted the hon. member for Krugersdorp and now I quote the unrevised Hansard of the hon. member for Houghton&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He told us this Bill was being introduced because there was doubt whether the police had in the past acted within the law when they set up road blocks and conducted searches of vehicles.</block>

<p>The hon. member also said that she had read my Second Reading speech&#x2014;well, that is exactly what I said. I want to quote from my Second Reading speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In spite of this positive attitude on the part of the public, the question has on several occasions arisen in police circles whether the erection of roadblocks and the searching of vehicles without a warrant should not be based on a firmer legal foundation.</block>

<p>*I singled this out at the outset of the Second Reading debate as the reason why we had come to this House&#x2014;to ensure that our actions were based on a firm legal foundation.</p>

<p>&#x2020; The hon. member also asked me if I could tell the House whether any people were shot or wounded at road blocks or during searches, whether any people attempted to evade arrest after their cars had been stopped and whether people without valid passes had tried to escape arrest and were in any way injured by the police during such action. I have ascertained from the Commissioner that from January 1982 to date the police fired on eight occasions on vehicles which did not stop, that three persons were fatally injured and that four were injured because of these incidents. When one considers, however, that during last year 28 980 road blocks were set up, one realizes that the incidents numbered only a few. It nevertheless remains regrettable.</p>

<p>*It is cause for gratitude that there have only been a very small number of incidents, if one compares that number with the large number of roadblocks and the large number of people involved.</p>

<p>&#x2020; Then the hon. member tried her hand at law and the interpretation of it. She said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe that since the police will now not be accountable for any actions performed during searches or at road blocks a new principle is indeed being introduced in this Bill.</block>

<p>I should just like to confirm this aspect.

I refer hon. members to Hansard, 7 June 1965, column 7296. The hon. member was in this House at the time and was already a member of that party. The then hon. Minister of Justice said the following during the Second Reading debate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Clause one of this measure gives a policeman the right to&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">search without warrant any person, premises, other place, vehicle, vessel or aircraft, or any receptacle of any nature, at any place in the Republic within a distance of one mile of any border between the Republic and any foreign State or territory and seize anything foreign by him upon such person or upon or in such premises, other place, vehicle, vessel, aircraft or receptacle.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] Basically that is the same provision. The hon. the Minister went on to give the reason for this clause&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reason why I have introduced this Bill is to strengthen our existing security measures even more. As I have said on previous occasions we will eventually have to deal with the infiltration of well-trained saboteurs. This is the third phase which we shall have to face to an increasing extent. These saboteurs are sent to South Africa to do the work for which they have been trained in other territories and so it is absolutely necessary that our police should have this power in order to protect the lives and safety of our people.</block>

If under this provision a policeman regularly searches the car of an individual he cannot get along with and, in other words, harasses him by means of those searches, in what way is he accountable for his actions? In what way can the victim, the owner of the car, get redress through the courts if the policeman is entitled to search that car anywhere at any stage on a public road?</p>

<p>I should like to single out certain other aspects which have been highlighted and reply to them. Throughout the debate, particularly with a view to the future implementation of the legislation, the hon. member for Houghton and other hon. members have had a great deal to say about the issue of reasonable grounds. Various hon. members have pointed out that it is almost impossible to have reasonable grounds or a reasonable suspicion in all cases where it is necessary to implement this legislation. Specifically in view of the practical nature of this matter, no provision for reasonable grounds has been made since 1965.</p>

<p>When, on the first day of the debate, I asked the hon. member for Durban Central to quote any authority to support the standpoint he had adopted, I could see on his face that he had no authority. I therefore pulled his leg. However, when he quoted an authority in the House the following day I did not make disparaging reference to it. The hon. member need only go and read my Second Reading speech. I told him that although I respected his authority, the fact of the matter was that we had a South African problem that we have to deal with accordding to our own judgment. I respect the good judgment that may prevail in the United Kingdom, but we are here attempting to deal with a unique problem in accordance with our own good judgment. I repeat that to determine reasonable grounds in all instances under the circumstances that we have sketched here, is virtually impossible. For that very reason, and because this legal issue has been raised consistently over the past number of years, it was decided to ask the law advisers to advise us in this regard. Problems can arise with regard to the concept of reasonable grounds in assessing certain actions, and accordingly we must now place beyond all doubt what is at issue here. The Government states clearly that we cannot deal with a situation such as this with the limiting factor of reasonable grounds in each case. However, the qualification is that this does not mean that the accountability of the <span class="col_3099-3100" refersTo="page_1578"/>State for any unlawful action is being reduced in any respect. I really think that the hon. member for Houghton should get herself another legal adviser, because the one who is advising her at present is not giving her &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That, then, is the basic reason for this legislation.</p>

<p>I should like to tell the official Opposition that I find it strange that when it suits them they are very quick to speak of the law societies of South Africa. When it suits them, and others too, they are quick to hide behind the law societies. Sir, I am very proud of the law societies of South Africa. Indeed, I myself am a member of one of these societies. In the <i>Argus</i> of 8 February the Association of Law Societies is described as &#x201C;a non-political body with impeccable credentials, a body which has specialized knowledge of the enforcement of law and regulations and of interrogation&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The president of the Association of Law Societies, with its &#x201C;impeccable credentials&#x201D;, has paid a personal call on me and told me that the association gives this legislation its unqualified support. I take it the official Opposition has as much respect for the law societies of South Africa as I do. The Association of Law Societies, with its &#x201C;impeccable credentials&#x201D;, has now come forward and told me personally and by way of correspondence that they support the legislation in all respects. This is yet another reason, Mr. Speaker, why I have no hesitation in approaching you and asking you to allow this legislation to be passed by this House.</p>

<p>In this regard I should also like to refer to certain other matters. They are matters that have either been raised by hon. members or, over the past week to 10 days, have formed part of a very serious debate that has been conducted in South Africa and which, in the nature of the matter, has also enjoyed the earnest attention of the Government and that of the Commissioner of Police. It is extremely relevant to the legislation we are discussing now.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. the Minister a question? There has been a great deal of debate with regard to this Bill in the context of a formal roadblock. Do the provisions of this Bill give any policeman the power to search a vehicle anywhere else than at a formal roadblock? He is walking down the road, for instance, and sees a motor-car. Can he by himself and on his own initiative, search that motor-car?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I think we must seek the reply in section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977. I have only the Afrikaans text with me, and accordingly I shall reply to the hon. member in Afrikaans. The &#x201C;circumstances in which article may be seized without search warrant&#x201D; are the following, in terms of section 22&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A police official may without a search warrant search any person or container or premises for the purpose of seizing any article referred to in section 20&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) if the person concerned consents to the search for and the seizure of the article in question, or if the person who may consent to the search of the container or premises consents to such search and the seizure of the article in question; or</li>

<li>(b) if he on reasonable grounds believes&#x2014;</li>

</ol>

<p>That is to say, the police officer&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) that a search warrant will be issued to him under paragraph (a) of section 21(1) if he applies for such warrant; and</li>

<li>(ii) that the delay in obtaining such warrant would defeat the object of the search.</li>

</ol>

<p>Therefore, as I see the matter, section 22 applies to the actions of police when searching vehicles under given circumstances, as does the section which is now to be inserted in the Act by way of this Bill. That is how I should like to reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question.</p>

<p>Due to the diversity of the activities of the S.A. Police it is inevitable that certain branches of the Force have to perform their duties in civilian dress and in unidentified vehicles. It is understandable that a degree of <span class="col_3101-3102" refersTo="page_1579"/>confusion and uncertainty may prevail among the public when they are stopped by such members of the Police Force, in the sense that without identification they do not always know whether they should come to a halt or get away. In particular, the tragic incident which took place recently casts light on this problem area in the activities of the Police. After consultation with the Commissioner of Police, I have decided&#x2014;and I should like to announce this here today&#x2014; that immediate steps will be taken to equip all police vehicles used on executive services with a mark of identification, a flashing light or apparatus of that nature. At this stage it is not possible to describe the equipment precisely, since certain aspects of its practical utilization require further investigation. However, steps will be taken to notify the public of details of the equipment as soon as finality has been reached.</p>

<p>Moreover, I should like to confirm once again that as far as the use of firearms by members of the Police Force is concerned, the statutory provisions and all other provisions and directives in that regard have been brought once again to the attention of each member of the Police Force and this will, moreover, be repeated on every possible occasion.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I just wish to say that I really think it is tragic that we in this House should have the situation that all representatives of the electorate in this House, except hon. members of the official Opposition, agree on the provisions of this legislation that we request this House to accept; that all responsible people, including the most senior association of lawyers in South Africa&#x2014;the Association of Law Societies of the Republic of South Africa&#x2014;support this legislation in every respect, whereas the PFP opposes it. Therefore we have the support of that respected organization of lawyers, too. However, the official Opposition of this country states in this House that on the basis of reasons advanced by them, they are not prepared in these circumstances to enable the S.A. Police to combat crime and fight every form of terrorist activity in our country. I think that is tragic, and I also believe that the hon. the Leader of the official Opposition, as he sits there now, is bitterly regretting that this matter is going to be cast in his teeth and in the teeth of his party. However, the electorate of South Africa must know this; they will know it, too.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#swart">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. A. F. SWART</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are now in the Committee Stage of a Bill which contains a number of schedules. It is hardly appropriate to debate the schedules at this stage, and therefore I merely stand up to say that we shall note our objections to the clauses as they are but while we shall continue the debate on the principles, as well as on some of the matters which the hon. the Deputy Minister has raised, during the Third Reading.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to (Official Opposition dissenting).</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the CP does not support clause 2, since it deals with the area known as Kutama and Senthimula, and because this House previously approved its being excised from the Venda area and compensatory land being purchased in its place.</p>

<p>In the debate thus far, apart from one meagre little argument which he raised, the hon. the Deputy Minister has furnished no proof as to why the clause should be agreed to and the area should remain where it is. On the other hand, there is overwhelming evidence that the area should be excised. In 1973 Parliament approved the excision of Kutama and Senthimula from the Venda area and the substitution of other land in its place. Besides, that decision was preceded by an in-depth investigation by the Commission for Co-operation an Development. More proposals were submitted to Parliament in 1975 and those proposals were also preceded by an investigation which took the previous recommendations of the commission and the decision of Parliament into consideration. We then had a second investigation by the commission. In 1979 an international agreement was concluded with Venda to the effect that this area would not remain incorporated in Venda. This was also approved by Parliament. After 1979, and before August 1981, the Commission for Cooperation and Development produced a further three reports. This was done under the chairman at that time, the present Deputy Minister. In all three those reports the commission recommended that Senthimula and Kutama should become a White area.</p>

<p>They gave reasons as to why this should be the case. The reason was that by replacing Senthimula and Kutama with other land, Venda could be consolidated into one geographic unit and, after all, this has been the ideal. Their finding was that if the exchange should take place and the compensatory land were to be added, Venda would have a rail link, since the land which was being added adjoined the railway line. Venda would then have a rail link, something which would be a tremendous asset and which would be to the advantage of its economic development as well as to its citizens who did not live in Venda, but who worked elsewhere in the <span class="col_3105-3106" refersTo="page_1581"/>RSA and who could then make use of the rail link. Moreover, the commission&#x2019;s finding was that the compensatory land had already been planned agriculturally, and that the removal of people had already begun&#x2014;everything was going according to plan and this was in the interests of Venda. It is also in the interests of South Africa that this proposal be implemented in its present form.</p>

<p>In October 1981, the hon. the Minister assembled the Northern Transvaal farmers affected by this in Pretoria. They discussed the consolidation plans. On that occasion the then chairman said that over his dead body would the area remain where it was. I must say the frail little body of the hon. the Deputy Minister does not seem to me to be showing any signs of death today; he still looks healthy. [Interjections.] Therefore the position is that we have five investigations and one international contract as evidence to confirm that the exchange should in fact take place because it is in the interests of both States and in the interests of the citizens of Venda. Then suddenly, on 7 July, the hon. the Minister of Manpower announced that the final borders of Venda had been decided and that Senthimula and Kutama would remain where they were and would no longer be moved. No farmer or interested party had been consulted. As far back as October 1981 they had been told that this would not happen, and then suddenly the announcement came: This is the final consolidation. The following day President Mphephu reacted by saying that this had not been negotiated with him. He also said that when the hon. the Minister of Manpower had visited him in his office, they had not spoken about these matters, but about matters other than those the hon. the Minister had announced.</p>

<p>I am simply stating the facts as we have them before us. Does the hon. the Minister wish to deny that the hon. the Minister of Manpower made an announcement on 7 July? [Interjections.] Does the hon. the Minister wish to deny that? [Interjections.] The Venda Government said that no final agreement had been concluded with them. On the 19th of that same month the chairman of the commission, who is now the hon. the Deputy Minister, said that the Cabinet had not yet decided on these matters. He said that he did not know whether they would decide that day. The Cabinet had not yet decided, but on the 7th the hon. the Minister had already made final announcements. I wish to put a specific question to the hon. the Deputy Minister, and this is a question to which I should like a reply. When did the Cabinet decide on these matters? [Interjections.] When, in fact, did the Cabinet decide? By 19 July 1982 the Cabinet had not yet made a decision. I wish to put a further question to the hon. the Deputy Minister. Who took the initiative, because President Mphephu said that the hon. the Minister of Manpower had paid him a visit? Is it not the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Information or the hon. the Deputy Minister of Development and of Land Affairs who have to do that work? What has the hon. the Minister of Manpower to do with Venda when it comes to land affairs between South Africa and Venda? Therefore I am putting this question to the hon. the Deputy Minister: When did the Cabinet decide and who took the initiative?</p>

My colleague indicated that people are no longer being consulted, but I wish to put this question to the hon. the Deputy Minister: Is it Government policy that the Minister involved&#x2014;the hon. the Deputy should listen now, since he has to reply&#x2014;no longer makes announcements, but that the MP makes the announcement? If consolidation were to take place in the constituencies of hon. members in that party, is it going to become customary for them, and not the hon. the Minister, to make the announcement? Are military aircraft going to be made available to them as well, so that the Press may be invited to observe this important announcement? [Interjections.] Could the hon. the Deputy Minister tell me whether it is the <span class="col_3107-3108" refersTo="page_1582"/>policy, this change which has now taken place?</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, I know all those areas. I made the announcement and I invited the MP to come. However, I did not ask the MP to go and make the announcement in a constituency. I went to do so myself. This has always been the premise. What does one do with an hon. Minister who makes decisions, but who does not go and visit the people? He sends the MP. Are they also going to give other MPs and us the right to announce Government undertakings anywhere in South Africa, for example, the large development point at Alldays, which later proved to be still-born? That was also announced on behalf of that Minister. Is it true that MPs will be able to announce this kind of thing in the future?</p>

<p>I conclude by saying that we do not support this clause, since it is not in the interests of South Africa. Nor is it in the interests of Venda. It is beneficial to the development of Venda that that area be consolidated in one piece, and it is possible to do so. All the evidence, all the investigations, have indicated that that should be the case and that it would be conducive to the economic development as well as convenient for the inhabitants if Venda were consolidated as was previously proposed.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Manpower would not have made an announcement on Kutama and Senthimula on 7 July if the Cabinet had not already made a decision. I am, in fact, aware that the Minister of Manpower and the then Deputy Minister of Development and of Land Affairs had spoken to President Mphephu about the consolidation of Venda, that the negotiations at that level had been continued, that the matter had been before the Cabinet and that the Cabinet had decided that Kutama and Senthimula would not be removed and that an announcement to that effect would be made. It is no use those hon. members trying to give the country the impression that the commission will no longer hear evidence at such investigations. In fact the contrary is being proved. Tomorrow the commission is going to hear evidence on the consolidation of KwaNdebele. On the basis of information at its disposal, the Cabinet was of the opinion that it could settle the matter concerning Kutama, Senthimula and Venda and that an announcement could be made without other investigations having to be done in this regard. That is the factual situation. My information is that the Agricultural Union was also consulted.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate we tried in vain to get the Minister to furnish a reason for that area no longer being declared a White area This afternoon there has been a further attempt to get the hon. the Minister to furnish a reason as to why that area should not be declared a White area. However, the only reason we have been given, is that the Cabinet has decided it should not. We have all the evidence that on five occasions competent people&#x2014;I regard the hon. the Deputy Minister as being a competent person&#x2014; made recommendations in respect of that particular area and on each occasion the recommendation was that that area should become a White area. However, in spite of that, we are now being told that because the omniscient Cabinet decided that the area would no longer become a White area, it is suddenly right that it should not. All the local evidence and all the investigations which were carried out indicated that it would be in the interests of South Africa, as well as of Venda, for the area to be declared a White area. In fact, compensatory land had already been purchased for this purpose. Really, Sir, to come to this highest Council Chamber in the country and to submit as the only justification that the omniscient Cabinet decided to do so, is just not good enough. The hon. the Deputy Minister must convince us that he and his commission made a mistake in their recommendations. Suddenly a particular consideration has occurred to the Cabinet as to why the area should no longer become a White area. However, to come and tell us that because the omniscient Cabinet decided it was the right thing to do, simply does not hold good.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think the hon. members are correct in saying that I gave no reason as to why Kutama and Senthimula are no longer to become a White area. I wish to point out to this House that when the first decision on Kutama and Senthimula was taken in 1973&#x2014;it is a piece of land less than 20 000 ha in extent&#x2014;there were fewer than 7 000 people in that area. When the first decision to remove Kutama and Senthimula was taken, Dr. Phatudi&#x2019;s people were moved between 1973 and 1975. Those people were moved. 1975 came and went with consolidation proposals which confirmed that Kutama and Senthimula were to become a White area. At that stage there were already 15 000 people in that area. Today, however, there <span class="col_3111-3112" refersTo="page_1584"/>are more than 25 000 people in the area and it would cost us more than R30 million to move them from Kutama and Senthimula over a distance of barely 15 km as the crow flies. If there is one reason which could be advanced, it is the cost of the removal.</p>

<p>No. The Cabinet simply decided that the removals were no longer going to take place. Those hon. members are also aware that the Cabinet has come forward with a brand new plan for regional economic development, in terms of which the removal of people as such is no longer so essential, and the hon. member for Lichtenburg and the former hon. member for Waterberg were members of the Cabinet when these decisions were made.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not hiding behind them. Those hon. members opposite have always propagated economic deconcentration, but now that the Government has come forward with a policy to promote this actively, those hon. members are suddenly no longer happy about it. The fact of the matter is that the removal of certain Black spots is related to the policy of economic deconcentration of the Government, the establishment of growth points and everything connected with this.</p>

<p>I have now given hon. members two reasons in the process. It really does not make sense in terms of the entire process to move people only a little way from where they are now. To say that the only reason I can advance is the fact that the Cabinet decided in its wisdom that the inhabitants of Kutama and Senthimula should not move, is really not a valid argument in this regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister has just advanced a further argument, viz. economic deconcentration and regional development. Now I wish to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that the step they are taking here is in fact adversely affecting the economic development of Venda, it is directly affecting it in an adverse way. This area is an unfavourably situated one, of which the commission itself said that there was no chance of its being included in Venda. In other words, it is out of the way. It is situated far from Venda. Moreover, if this area is exchanged for the land which has already been purchased and planned, Venda will have a rail link connecting it to the rest of the world. This is something it does not have at present. The hon. the Deputy Minister cannot tell me that this is not in the interests of Venda&#x2019;s economic development. It is indeed in its interests. Surely regional development is not there to benefit a certain group only. Surely it is there to promote the policy of separate development of the Black States and to strengthen those States economically. In taking this step, the hon. the Deputy Minister is acting contrary to this. He is not going to promote economic regional development in such a way that Venda also benefits. However, this is not all. The hon. the Deputy Minister said it was going to cost R30 million. I say that that figure given by the hon. the Deputy Minister was sheer conjecture.</p>

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the commission made an estimate and said in 1981 that it would cost R12 million. They made a scientific estimate in 1981, 19 months ago. Costs have not risen to that extent. Nor have so many additional people moved into that area. The number of people mentioned by the hon. the Deputy Minister were there in 1981 already. In 1980 the commission estimated that it would cost R10 million. Between 1980 and 1981 the amount increased by R2 million. However, since the end of 1981 until now, the amount has suddenly increased <span class="col_3113-3114" refersTo="page_1585"/>by R18 million. The hon. the Deputy Minister has not done his sums; he is just talking at random. I do not accept that figure. I accept the figure based on a scientific estimate. Not one of the arguments advanced by the hon. the Deputy Minister has any substance. He is only doing one thing, and that is to try and protect the hon. the Minister of Manpower, who acted out of turn. No one asked for this place not to be removed. No one knows why he did it, and now the entire Cabinet and everyone else has to protect him.</p>

<p>Hon. members are kicking up a fuss about the non-removal of Kutama and Senthimula and about the whole question of establishing growth points. If the Government wishes to protect a place such as Soekmekaar and to see to it that Soekmekaar&#x2019;s community is maintained after all the problems which have arisen there&#x2014;hon. members know what I am referring to&#x2014;what other instrument does it have than to widen the Soekmekaar corridor in order to make Soekmekaar a viable community once more? This was not done merely on the basis of the wisdom of the Cabinet. Surely hon. members are aware that the Cabinet often does not accept the proposals of its own commissions. I have a letter here which I could quote which gives all the details. I think hon. members have taken this matter a little far. On 12 November 1981 the agricultural unions concerned requested that Matoks and Ramagoep should not be removed and that Kutama and Senthimula should no longer be removed. Hon. members can come and get the details. In addition, they asked for the return of the land, which was intended to be compensatory land. The Government is in the process of doing so. The Van der Walt Commission itself said that Matoks and Ramagoep could not be removed. It would be foolish to try and do so. We are also going to return the land which was meant to be exchanged for Kutama and Senthimula. Surely we did say that this would be the case. In this way we are gong to afford Soekmekaar the opportunity of developing again. The hon. member is now claiming that Bandelierkop gives those people access to a railway line through which they gain access to Africa. Surely the hon. member is aware that his commission&#x2019;s proposals&#x2014;the Soekmekaar proposals, as they stand&#x2014;do not mean that that land is going to be extended right up to Bandelierkop.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, surely the hon. member was not referring to Soekmekaar. He was talking about Bandelierkop. [Interjections.] At Bandelierkop the land does not extend right up to the railway station. [Interjections.] We have proposals which we are now going to submit. The Cabinet has decided that in the process, Soekmekaar should be afforded the opportunity of being opened up. This is being done now. It is being done in consultation with the people of the S.A. Agricultural Union. The hon. member for Lichtenburg would do well to obtain the documents in this connection and consult them. He would do well to go to that area, or to invite me to go there, so that we can go and ask the farmers what <span class="col_3115-3116" refersTo="page_1586"/>they requested with regard to Kutama and Senthimula, as well as with regard to Matoks and Ramagoep. Let us go and ask the farmers what they want. Let us determine whether the farmers want what the hon. member for Lichtenburg is advocating, or whether they want what the Cabinet proposed.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this was in fact done.

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister said that I had gone too far now and that the fight was on between us. I want to concede to him that this is so. He and I last fought when we were in grade 1. Therefore it will not matter if we fight again today; we shall remain friends. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>However, I want to put it to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he should go and read his own report again. If he does, he will find that the argument is not relevant to Bandelierkop, but to another place. In fact, this was one of the arguments advanced for the replacement of Kutama and Senthimula. It was in fact concerned with a railway connection. It says so in the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s own report. He should go and read it instead of blaming me and alleging that I do not know my facts.</p>

<p>I say that he should go and read his own report and refresh his memory a little, then he will see what he himself said. He should also go and read in his report what it says about the cost, which the hon. the Deputy Minister alleged would be R12 million. That was only 19 months ago. He should go and read it and then come and tell us what has been happening since then. Has the inflation rate risen so enormously in Senthimula alone that the cost in that case is now going to be R30 million?</p>

<p>Then there is another question which I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister. He says that the hon. the Minister of Manpower consulted the farmers. I want to ask him whether an MP has greater authority now than the Commission for Co-operation and Development. Can an MP now consult the farmers in his constituency and, in so doing, completely eliminate the Commission for Co-operation and Development? All the other approaches are now being eliminated, therefore, and the Cabinet is simply taking decisions without the commission having investigated matters first. I want to know since when this has been the case. Since when have these things been happening?</p>

<p>All I want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister is that he is welcome to proceed in this manner. They are welcome to proceed in this matter. In this way they are giving us even more sticks with which to beat them. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>With regard to that particular matter which the hon. the Deputy Minister has just mentioned, does he mean to deny that on that occasion, he himself believed that Kutama and Senthimula should be declared White areas, as he has repeatedly stated in his reports? Therefore I am convinced that the hon. the Minister himself still believes that this would have been the best arrangement. Now the hon. the Deputy Minister also says that without consulting anyone, the Cabinet decided in its wisdom that that land should remain part of Venda. So that Cabinet decision must have been taken before 7 July. Does the hon. the Deputy Minister mean to tell me that almost 14 days after this decision had been taken by the Cabinet, he was still not aware of the existence of such a Cabinet decision? Fourteen days later, on 20 July, that hon. Deputy Minister was still saying&#x2014;and I quote what he said, according to <i>The Citizen</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Plans for Venda have not been finalized by the authorities, Mr. Hennie van der Walt, chairman of the Commission for Co-operation and Development, said yesterday. This is in direct contrast to a statement by Mr. Fanie Botha, Minister of Labour, when he addressed his constituents recently. Mr. Van der Walt made his statement in Pretoria when he told the Press the background to the overall consolidation plans for all independent and national States which were handed to the Government yesterday.</block>

<p>In other words, on 19 July. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_3119-3120" refersTo="page_1588"/>It now appears that Mr. Fanie Botha jumped the gun with his announcement. Mr. Van der Walt made it clear that the issue of Venda consolidation will go before a Select Committee next year.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I cannot accept that the chairman of a commission which has to investigate international boundaries was still not aware of a Cabinet decision 14 days after that Cabinet decision had been taken. Neither can we accept, therefore, that such a thing existed at that stage. Otherwise the hon. the Deputy Minister must tell us that he was totally unaware of the fact that such a decision had been taken. Therefore we have to oppose this clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to get the facts straight. The hon. the Minister of Manpower made the announcement on 7 July. It is clear, therefore, that the Cabinet took that decision before 7 July. [Interjections.] On the 19th, we submitted the rest of the recommendations for consolidation to the Cabinet. But I have already told hon. members opposite that this matter was singled out and dealt with separately. At that stage I was not yet a Deputy Minister or a member of the Cabinet who could participate in taking such a decision or attend meetings in that connection. I reject the version which the hon. member for Pietersburg read. Only one true version has appeared in the Press of what happened on that day, and that is the version which appeared in <i>Beeid.</i> I was asked whether the announcement which Mr. Fanie Botha had made with regard to Venda indicated the final boundaries of Venda. My reply was: No final boundaries can be laid down before the matter has been piloted through Parliament by way of legislation. [Interjections.] This has been my standpoint throughout. Surely this is so. There cannot be any final boundaries before legislation in that connection has been passed by this House. Hon. members must not try to raise a dust about a few words. No boundary is final until it has been approved by this House. [Interjections.] If the hon. the Minister of Manpower referred to final boundaries, surely those hon. members know what he meant. He could not possibly have meant that he was going to circumvent the authority of this Parliament by announcing final boundaries before such final boundaries had been embodied in legislation.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s concluding remark is significant. He says that he had nothing to do with the whole matter. The fact is, however, that the hon. the Deputy Minister was the chairman of the Commission for Co-operation and Development. I cannot sufficiently emphasize the fact that South African farmers in particular have repeatedly been told that all interested parties will be consulted in all cases of consolidation. I do not for a moment doubt the word of the hon. the Deputy Minister as a person, and he has said again this afternoon that he repeats that assurance.</p>

<p>We now have the right to ask why an exception was made in this particular case to the promise given to our people.</p>

<p>Only one reason is given: We are dealing here with a senior Minister. Are we to assume, then, that if a senior Minister who sometimes has problems in his constituency wishes to decide differently, the promises of the Government are no longer valid? Is this the rationale? Surely there is no justification for alleging that in this case there was any reason whatsoever for these peculiar circumstances under which this decision was taken, other than the personal interests of the hon. the Minister of Manpower. I should like to know, if there was <span class="col_3121-3122" refersTo="page_1589"/>any reason other than the personal problems of the hon. the Minister of Manpower in his constituency, why the normal procedure which had been repeatedly explained to our people and which had been solemnly promised them was not followed in this case.</p>

<p>There is a further peculiarity. It is alleged that organized agriculture was consulted. It has always been the task of the Commission for Co-operation and Development, which has to submit the final recommendations to the Cabinet, to consult with organized agriculture. In this case, too, the reply which we are given and which is supposed to settle the matter is that the hon. senior Minister consulted with them and that for this reason it was no longer necessary for the Commission for Co-operation and Development to have any say in this matter.</p>

<p>I think that in this case, the conduct of the hon. the Minister of Manpower was an embarrassment, and in order to save his skin, solemn promises made in the past have not been kept.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. members of the CP are trying to make a little political capital today. It is quite clear that the reason for their behaviour in this House is to be found in the fact that by-elections are going to be held. Now they are trying to discredit the hon. the Minister of Manpower, the NP&#x2019;s candidate in Soutpansberg&#x2014;he has been representing that constituency in this House for years&#x2014; senior Minister and Leader of the House, in the eyes of the electorate and the people. This is one of their objectives. The other objective they are trying to achieve is to discredit the hon. the Deputy Minister and the Cabinet.</p>

<p>The hon. members pretend that the interested parties were not consulted. The hon. member should know what the functions of the commission are. He should also know, therefore, that factors are taken into consideration from time to time. It is true that the commission investigates matters repeatedly and considers certain factors. He must realize that there are numerous factors. The commission merely makes recommendations, while the Cabinet has the final say.</p>

<p>It is not a pleasant task to remove people, whether they be White, Brown or Black. Such a removal costs money, and on top of that it causes disruption. So there are many factors which have to be taken into consideration from time to time.</p>

<p>The hon. members allege that the hon. the Minister of Manpower is serving his own interests, but surely such an allegation cannot be true. We know, after all, that he has been serving the interests of his voters in this House almost all his life. That is the reason why he is still sitting here and why he will return to this House after the by-election in May. He seeks to promote the interests of his voters; not his personal interests. The hon. members are simply playing a cheap political game this afternoon. What is happening in South Africa now, and what will happen in future, is in the best interests of the people of South Africa, and if the Cabinet, in its wisdom, takes a decision at the recommendation of this commission, which is working day and night, in order to negotiate the best possible agreement in the interests of the people of South Africa, this Parliament will give effect to it.</p>

<heading>CULTURE PROMOTION BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Prof. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member for Bryanston has already indicated, we support this Bill in principle. I must add that after the explanation given by the hon. the Minister and by the hon. member for Virginia, we are in some doubt as to whether the Bill actually merits our support, but I shall come to that later.</p>

<p>I just want to say, in the first place, that there are some things in the Bill which we can certainly support without any qualification. We are grateful for the fact that the restriction embodied in the present Act, i.e. that the promotion of culture by the National Cultural Council and the regional committees is confined to Whites, has been removed in this Bill. As the hon. member for Bryanston indicated, a further objective is involved with which we are also basically in agreement. I am referring to the opportunity which has now been created to develop and promote the culture of the other groups in South Africa as well. Just as we have a plurality of peoples in South Africa, we have a plurality of cultures as well.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<p>Why do you not recognize it in your policy?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Prof. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>I replied to the hon. member for Durban North the other day concerning the question of culture and groups as it relates to their own policy. I do not want to go into the matter again. The hon. member for Bryanston indicated very clearly&#x2014;the hon. member for Durban North should have taken the trouble to listen to him&#x2014;the extent to which our policy recognizes the cultural plurality of South Africa, the hon. member would do well to read that speech again. Just as certainly as we have a plurality of peoples, we have a plurality of cultures as well. Therefore I think it is a good thing that this should be recognized and that special steps should be taken to preserve and promote the multiplicity of cultures.</p>

<p>I want to avail myself of this opportunity of expressing our appreciation for what the department and the National Cultural Council have been doing over the years in the field of the promotion of culture. Indeed, when one reads the annual report of the department, one sees what has been and is still being done and achieved in this connection. One also becomes aware of the enormous range of the activities of the regional committees. One sincerely appreciates those matters. On this occasion, where we are formally taking leave of the National Cultural Council, it is no more than right that we should also express our appreciation to the National Cultural Council and the members who served on the council, even though the functions of the council were quite limited. I think it is appropriate, however, that we <span class="col_3125-3126" refersTo="page_1591"/>should make use of this opportunity to record our appreciation for the work done by the Cultural Council and to people who gave up their time to serve on it.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister when he expects to receive the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Promotion of the Performing Arts to which he referred in his Second Reading speech.</p>

<p>Before I come to the Bill itself, allow me to comment on the speech made by the hon. member for Virginia. His accusation that the hon. member for Bryanston had introduced politics into the debate was not correct and was actually a case of the pot calling the kettle black. After all, the whole basis of the measure, as explained by the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Virginia, i.e. the fact that this matter has a bearing on the constitutional proposals of the Government, means that the matter has in fact been brought into the political arena. What is political and what is not is actually relative in this connection. I do not want to argue about that now. I shall come back to it later.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Virginia said. I am very grateful for the appeal he made that we should be careful not to involve culture in party politics. We must indeed try not to exploit culture for party political purposes. I think the hon. the Minister will concede to me that this has in fact happened at times in the past. Let us accept that this is something which belongs to the past and let us adopt a more disinterested approach to culture and the promotion of culture in South Africa in future. Judging by the statements that have been made here, even by my friends to my left, it is important to note that what matters to us, when it comes to a disinterested appreciation of culture, is that one should look at cultural creation and cultural expression, and not at the creator of culture in terms of his nationality, colour, race, religion, ethnic context or whatever. In other words, when we judge a cultural product, a cultural form or a cultural expression, not on the basis of quality, but on the basis of the colour or race of its creator, we are impoverishing ourselves and we are simply revealing our own lack of cultivation. I am grateful for the fact that we are able to reflect on these matters in a calm atmosphere and without discussing this matter in emotional terms.</p>

<p>Having said this, I still have quite a few problems with the Bill. I am not referring to the problems in order to indulge in some petty political point-scoring, but because I really do have problems with the system as it is set out in this Bill and as it has been explained by the hon. the Minister and by other hon. members on the Government side. The basis of the new promotion of culture, as it appears from the Bill and as it has been explained by the hon. the Minister, is that in the first place, the Bill basically provides for two things, i.e. the promotion of the culture of the various groups or peoples in South Africa on the one hand and, on the other hand, the possibility of the joint promotion of culture in respect of those cultural aspects that are shared by all the people of South Africa. The hon. the Minister spoke about the culture of the Whites. This was perhaps an unfortunate term which he used. What he actually meant was the culture of the Whites as bearers of the wider culture of the West, or something of that nature. That is the way I understood him, but I am not going to argue the point. In that connection, the hon. the Minister said that the Ministers of the respective chambers that are going to be created would promote the separate cultures of the respective groups. In other words, this has a bearing on the segmental concept in the constitutional proposals. The Department of National Education, as we know it at the moment, will be charged with the promotion of the culture of the Whites, while the promotion of the culture of the Coloureds will be entrusted to the Coloured Minister and that of the Indians to an Indian Minister. I think this is the essence of the message contained in the Bill, as explained in this House by the hon. the Minister. In addition, this promotion of culture will be undertaken by regional committees. There are conflicts which I cannot resolve, and I am explaining my problem in a spirit of responsibility.</p>

<p>Let me begin with the basic principle that each group has to promote its own culture. I indicated earlier that within the context of the constitutional proposals, I have problems when we talk about the Coloured group. With the possible exception of the Malay group, which constitutes a cultural subgroup in certain respects, and perhaps the Griquas as well, the Coloureds do not have any culture <span class="col_3127-3128" refersTo="page_1592"/>of their own which needs to be promoted.</p>

<p>There is no point in arguing at that level. The great majority of Coloured people have no culture of their own, no culture which needs to be promoted separately. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Virginia said that we were concerned here with the separate promotion of the culture of each people. Now the Government has already conceded that the Coloured people do not constitute a separate people, and the message which is conveyed, quite correctly, is that culture is normally a concept which is associated with the existence of separate peoples. As I have said, the Coloureds are not a separate people, and for that reason they do not have a separate and identifiable culture of their own.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Do they form part of the Afrikaner people?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Prof. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>They do not have a separate, identifiable culture like the Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking groups, for example. As we all know, their culture is the same as the culture of most of us in this House. If we were now, in terms of the concept of segmentation, to charge a Coloured Minister with the promotion of the Coloured people&#x2019;s culture, what would that mean? Sir, the whole simply does not make sense to me. That whole concept is illogical. Allow me to say at once that what I am saying here should not be interpreted as a defence of the Government&#x2019;s constitutional proposals, but I can only say that if the Government wants to employ the concept of segmentation and if it wants to apply that concept in respect of the Coloured people and their culture as well, the Government is doing that concept an injustice, because there is no identifiable separate culture in respect of the Coloured people.</p>

<p>But let us go a little further and look at the Indians as well. The hon. the Minister made it quite clear that a Minister or a Deputy Minister would be responsible for promoting the culture of the Indians. I accept the Indians as a part of the South African nation. But here again, we are faced with a problem. There are at least two major Indian groups in the country, the Hindus and the Moslems, and I believe the hon. the Minister will concede to me that as far as culture is concerned, there are basic differences between these two groups. Now I do not quite understand this, for how can we appoint one Minister or Deputy Minister to promote the culture of all the Indians?</p>

<from>*Prof. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, certainly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_vuuren">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. M. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Department of National Education has a branch for the advancement of culture whose function it is to promote culture among the White section of the population. The White section of the population consists of the Afrikaans-speaking people, the English-speaking people, the Portuguese-speaking people, and others. That one branch promotes the culture of all these groups. By the same token, why can one Minister not promote the culture of the various Coloured groups or of the various Indian Groups?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Prof. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is correct. The hon. member is actually endorsing my standpoint. All my argument boils down to, therefore, is that it is not necessary to have separate Ministers. That one Minister can indeed exercise control over all the common cultural affairs of all <span class="col_3129-3130" refersTo="page_1593"/>the various groups. I shall come back to this later.</p>

<p>I have referred to the promotion of culture among the Indian community. Now I take it that this Bill is also concerned with the promotion of culture among the Blacks. And now I have a problem. I have the greatest respect for the hon. the Minister of Co-operation and Development&#x2014;the hon. gentlemen is not in the House at the moment&#x2014;and I am also very fond of the hon. the Minister of Education and Training. I must say quite honestly, though, that I really do not regard them as people who can be charged with promoting the culture of anyone! In any event, they have too many other things to do. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Now my problem becomes even worse, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Prof. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>I repeat, Mr. Speaker, that these are problems which I have. The hon. member for Kimberley North should rather try to help me solve my problems. If it is the intention that separate provision should be made on this basis for the promotion of the cultures of the various Black peoples as well, what then? Hon. members on the Government side keep telling us&#x2014;quite rightly&#x2014;that the Blacks are made up of many different peoples. Is this going to mean, therefore, that we are going to have separate organizations for the promotion, within the context of this State&#x2014;I am not talking about the national States or the independent States&#x2014;of the separate cultures of the various Black peoples? This is a question I want to ask. Now someone should tell me that this is not the intention, and should then explain how it is going to be done. I should like to hear such an explanation.</p>

<p>When we examine the measures involving foreign countries which form part of the plan for the promotion of culture in terms of this Bill, such as bursaries which may be awarded, people who may be invited, visitors who may be sent overseas to attend exhibitions and to participate in other activities abroad, another pertinent question arises. I want to know whether it is the intention, as far as measures involving foreign countries are concerned, that each of the various Ministers&#x2014;say the Minister of Coloured Culture, the Minister of Indian Culture, etc.&#x2014; should be able to go and do these things off his own bat in terms of the exercising of the segmental autonomy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>That is a good question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Prof. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>I have to ask this question, because I have a problem in this respect. It seems to me that the basic problem is that a fine principle, i.e. the promotion of the culture of our people, has become enmeshed in the apartheid ideology of the Government, as well as in the segmental principles of the constitutional proposals. Instead of looking at culture alone and disregarding the other factors, therefore, it seems to me that we have here an entanglement of those very things that should be kept separate. I am putting these things to the hon. the Minister because they indicate clearly the problems I have with this measure.</p>

<p>When it comes to the question of the regional councils, my problems grow even worse. The hon. member for Virginia said something which went to the heart of the matter. If we understood the clause, the hon. member for Virginia said, we would realize that the essence of the matter is the fact that the various Ministers responsible for promoting the culture of the various cultural groups should be given the legal basis on which to promote the culture of each specific group, and that this should be done on a regional basis.</p>

<p>I have already said that I have problems. We may have a Coloured Minister, for example. However, there is no national cultural body for the Coloureds at the moment. This means that everything has to be done by means of the regional bodies, just as in the case of the Whites. Does this mean, however, that that Minister of Culture who is a Coloured person will appoint a regional Council for the Cape Province, a separate one for the Free State, where only a handful of Coloured people live, and a separate one for the Transvaal? How is this thing going to work? It gets even worse when we come to the question of the Indians. [Interjections.] All I can say is that the introduction of the principle of regional councils in connection <span class="col_3131-3132" refersTo="page_1594"/>with the promotion of culture in general is not going to work in these spheres, in my opinion.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. B. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Is the PFP going to support this legislation?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Prof. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague said, and I said at the beginning of my speech, that we do support it. I want to say that if the hon. member cannot understand the problems I have, the fault does not lie with me. The fault lies with him, because I am explaining the problems. I take it that the hon. the Minister has already given attention to the various facets of this legislation. We are supporting the Bill on the assumption that the hon. the Minister will be able to give us satisfactory replies to these questions I am asking. Otherwise I should be insulting his intelligence, for I really cannot believe that I am so intelligent that I am the only one who is able to discover these problems and that he has not noticed them. I assume that it was because he did not have time, or for some other reason, that he did not fully explain the situation to us in his Second Reading speech and did not give the replies to these questions which we are asking him.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also said that apart from this separate culture promotion, there would be an opportunity for shared participation in culture. However, I want to ask the hon. the Minister a few questions, because I have some problems in this connection as well. Are those three Ministers going to form a joint committee for promoting that common culture to which the hon. the Minister referred and which assuredly exists? I believe that that common participation in culture exists in South Africa among all our people. We all believe this and the hon. the Minister emphasized this. I want to ask the hon. the Minister; What mechanisms, what institutions, what methods are going to be used in terms of the structure of this legislation to promote that common culture&#x2014; that culture in which all the groups participate? Is it going to take the form of a joint committee consisting of the White Minister, the Coloured Minister and the Indian Minister? Will there be a national body, perhaps? The regional body&#x2014;the hon. member for Johannesburg West has also referred to this&#x2014; has already done excellent work for the Whites. However, if the need exists for a common participation in culture, where do the regional councils fit in? Are we going to have a joint regional council in the Cape Province, for example, which is going to concern itself with those aspects of the common participation in culture by Coloureds and Whites? If separate regional councils are established, we shall not be able to achieve and maintain that shared participation. In addition there is the problem of where mixed groups would fit into this whole situation. [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_staden">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. A. H. VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall come back to the speech of the hon. member Prof. Olivier in the course of my own speech, because I do not wish to anticipate certain parts of my speech by referring at this stage to certain arguments advanced by him.</p>

<p>Almost 14 days have elapsed since the debate on this Bill began. For this reason, some of the standpoints and arguments advanced at that time are no longer so clear in the minds of all of us. Therefore it is somewhat difficult to come back to some of the speeches now and to react to them. As I am going to do in respect of the speech made by the hon. member Prof. Olivier, I also wish to return periodically to some of these ideas expressed by certain hon. members.</p>

<p>The main idea and the objective of the Bill, in my opinion, is the promotion of culture in the Republic. The Republic is defined as the locality in which the Bill, if it is passed, will function. In the rest of the Bill&#x2014;the hon. the Minister also confirmed this&#x2014;provision is made for the differentiated promotion of culture in accordance with the various population groups. In fact, these are the very words which the hon. the Minister himself used. Where the existing legislation provided for the promotion of White culture, it is now being amplified or extended, therefore, to include the culture of all population groups.</p>

<p>I personally have no quarrel with this objective of the Bill. In fact, it is my absolute conviction that the Whites, and specifically White anthropologists, cultural historians, educationists and others have played a very significant role in the past in preserving, protecting and promoting the cultural heritage of the non-White population groups in our <span class="col_3133-3134" refersTo="page_1595"/>country. This important role which the Whites have played in this connection cannot be ignored. In my opinion, it is a fact which cannot be argued away. In this connection, therefore, we owe a debt of gratitude to these Whites who have played this important role in respect of non-White culture in the past.</p>

<p>In the interests of the true preservation, protection and promotion of culture, however, it is essential, in my opinion, that there by cultural differentiation. This cultural differentiation should be maintained as far as possible. Acculturation&#x2014;as I see it, this is the fusion of different cultures which are in contact with and which influence one another&#x2014;can carry in it the seeds of the degeneration or destruction of separate cultures in the sense that when, through the process of acculturation, those separate cultures have acquired a new form and have developed into a new culture, this will detract from the existing cultures which have undergone this process of acculturation.</p>

<p>In this respect I want to emphasize the fact that I think the Bill provides for the preservation of the cultural differentiation which I consider very important and for the promotion of separate existing cultures in our country and in our particular situation. However, if the Bill which seeks to promote the cultures of population groups is actually intended to bring about a shared culture, as the hon. member for Bryanston said, and if this is the intention with regard to South Africa and its people in particular and if the intention is to maintain freedom of association so that every individual may have the option of participating in the cultural activities of his choice or association, because every individual is free to do so, this means that the opporutunity may be created for a person from a particular population group with its particular culture to renounce, as it were, that culture of his own, to abandon it, because he now chooses to participate in the culture of another population group. As far as this is concerned, I believe that it would actually have a negative effect if this concession were made. One must remember that the culture of a group is in fact promoted by the more educated and more learned members of that group, the developed ones. If one allowed those very members of a specific population group the option of participating in the culture of another group, the culture of the population group to which these people actually belong would suffer, and then the purpose of this Bill, i.e. to promote the culture of the various population groups, would be frustrated. Therefore I believe that this idea of the hon. member is not a good one for the situation in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Actually, I want to ask, too, whether there are really so many people in this country who cannot be considered members of a specific population group, when judged by the following criteria in particular: Their family ties, their language, their customs, their religion, etc. Are there really significant numbers of people who have no ties with any population group whatever, and who therefore have no cultural home, with the result that they do not know where they actually belong in respect of participation in culture and the promotion of culture, and who should therefore be able to choose quite freely to participate in the culture of whichever group they would like to? I believe that such persons are quite rare in this country of ours and that for this reason, one should be very careful when it comes to the question of free association and so-called personal choice.</p>

<p>True promotion of culture is aimed in the first place at promoting one&#x2019;s own culture and at doing so by means of conservation, protection and development. This, I think, should be jealously guarded and protected by this House. On the other hand, every other population group with its own cultural heritage has the same right to guard jealously the promotion and the development of its own culture. It is true, too, that cultures may influence and enrich one another. This has happened in the past and it will continue to happen in future. This process of mutual influence and enrichment is a good one. However, one should not allow it to grow to the point where it results in a complete process of acculturation, which may harm the existing cultures. As long as they can enrich one another, I have no problem with it, but when the one is harmed by the other, I feel that very serious consideration should be given to the matter.</p>
