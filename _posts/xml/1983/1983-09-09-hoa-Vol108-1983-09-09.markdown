<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned last evening, I was dealing with the implications of the proposed new constitution, as well as the choices that will have to be made in the referendum on 2 November. Perhaps more than anyone else, I realize how fundamentally important the question, as well as the reply, are going to be to us. I shall therefore discuss the implications of a yes or no reply, as I see it, at the conclusion of my speech.</p>

<p>First and foremost, however, I want to turn to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, as well as to the hon. the leader of the CP, who is not here at present.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>He will be here in a moment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I also want to turn to the hon. member for I Lichtenburg, who is not here either.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>He has apologized for his absence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He did not notify me that he would not be here, even though he attacked me in his speech earlier.</p>

<p>Right at the outset, I want to say that there are certain standpoints we share with one another. The first is that a society itself determines what the political structures look like in which people have to exercise their rights. Society itself determines the constitution which provides the framework within which the lives of the people living in a certain country have to be arranged. I do not think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition would disagree with me on that score.</p>

<p>A second statement I want to make in this regard, is that in a society like ours, where there are intense and deep divisions, there will, in fact, be different opinions on how political participation by peoples and groups should be ensured. Thirdly, there is the fact that there are vast differences in South African society as regards culture, traditions, exposure to forms of government, as well as in respect of economic and social stratifications; all elements which are difficult to accommodate in a model which is to be a First World model. No one can underestimate the enormity of the task of establishing a constitution for South Africa in which individual and group rights can be accommodated. Consequently, when we conduct a debate, it would seem to me that it is reasonable to expect that the debate be conducted with due recognition of the society that has to be served by that constitutional dispensation. No one can dispute that.</p>

<p>Fourthly, I want to say today that it is not possible to establish a constitutional model for South Africa based on the homogeneous developing countries. That is simply not possible. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. the leader of the CP would agree with me that change and adjustment in the political sphere are inevitable. Firstly, they are inevitable because justice demands it. They are also inevitable because people who are excluded from the political processes demand inclusion on the mere basis of that consideration alone. They are also inevitable if the rights of the White people in this country are to be retained. Change is also necessary to ensure the rights of the Whites, and no one can dispute that. We in this House do not have a choice concerning the fact of change. We do not have a choice as to whether or not that change comes about. The only choice we have, is: How is it to come about? The only choice we have is one concerning the method that should be pursued to accomplish it, and there is not one hon. member in this House who would disagree with that.</p>

<p>Basically, there are only two ways in which constitutional or political change can come about in this country. The first is the constitutional method and the other is the violent method. We should not argue about that. The responsibility to decide on that does not rest with the Government, in the final instance. It is not only the responsibility of political leaders. It is the responsibility of every person that has to determine the pace, the method and direction of change by his vote. That is why I am saying in all earnestness that the responsibility of the Whites in this country is a tremendous responsibility, since if the method of change is to be the <span class="col_13599-13600" refersTo="page_1688"/>constitutional method, if it is to proceed in an orderly way, they are the people in whose hands the political power mainly lies today, they are the people who have to make that decision themselves, since the country&#x2019;s constitution cannot be changed if it is not changed here, in the first instance, and secondly, if it is not changed by the people who put this Government in power.</p>

<p>The constitution cannot be changed if people&#x2019;s attitudes or hearts do not change, since the one major condition for change, whether it be constitutional or otherwise, is that there must be a change in the attitudes and the hearts of people. If we in this country are not capable of displaying a change of heart and attitude towards one another, our effort to shape a constitution will be senseless and futile. That is why I am saying that before we can succeed here, we must succeed in making the noble objectives stated in the preamble to the constitution, part of our everyday lives, and if we are unable to do so, we are engaged in a futile exercise, and the discussions we have had with one another will have been equally futile.</p>

<p>There are few examples, if any, where in comparable circumstances the process of which I am speaking and which has to be given substance in the constitution we are discussing, has had a constitutional outcome. There are few examples where the outcome has been peaceful. We must not forget that when we participate in politics, our own view of the potential winner is fundamental. What is alarming, is that there are many people and many groups who think there can only be a White or a non-White winner. Is that not true?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#leader_of_the_opposition">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION</person>:</from>

<p>That is true.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition agrees with me. There can be no question of one potential winner, for if that is our philosophy of life, there is going to be no winner; our legacy will be violence, decadence, anarchy and chaos. If we do not succeed in allowing everyone to share, if we do not succeed in allowing everyone to win, no one will be able to remain loyal and help us to defend ourselves.</p>

<p>We may disagree on the methods today, but it is my contention that unless we can convince one another that it is in the interests of all of us that we should all win, we will not succeed either. This is the spirit in which the Government has approached its task.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point made the statement&#x2014;if I understood him correctly, and I do not want to quarrel with him now&#x2014;that separate development is being entrenched in the constitution for the first time. Surely those are not the true facts. The hon. member must go and read section 46(c) of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1961. The constitution does not entrench separate development. The present constitution only entrenches White rights, in the political sense of the word. It entrenches White political rights, since it provides that only Whites can be elected as members of Parliament. Surely that is a violation of the truth.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member did, in fact, say that. It is not true that we are entrenching separate development in the constitution for the first time. The existing constitution also excludes those people. I want to ask the hon. member&#x2014;and I am doing so in a spirit of goodwill&#x2014;which constitutional changes that have taken place since 1910 have he and his party, or his party&#x2019;s predecessors, supported? Yesterday he spoke about a tradition. I am asking him which constitutional changes that have taken place since 1910 have he or the parties to which he has belonged, supported? [Interjections.] Do not make a noise now. I am speaking to the hon. member. He spoke in elevated terms of a tradition for which he supposedly stood and for which the parties of which he was a member were supposed to have stood.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Chief Whip of the official Opposition &#x2026; No, wait. I shall rather not say that.</p>

<p>The fact is that constitutional change has, in fact, taken place. I want to make an admission today, since I do not intend running away from the facts. Part of that process was to remove the qualified franchise of the Coloureds as regards Parliament; part of that process was to terminate their representation here. It was a painful process; it was painful for the people who were affected by it, and equally painful for the people who carried it out. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands need not be so disparaging. He need not be so arrogant and haughty. That is the only language he knows. His arrogance is very much in evidence when he speaks to other people. Mr. Speaker, I was saying that life is born out of pain. If we had not travelled that painful path, we would not be able to ask our people on 2 November whether they would be prepared to allow Coloureds and Asians into our country&#x2019;s Parliament. [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I want to point out to the hon. members that there is a tendency in this House for hon. members to continue making interjections immediately after the Chair has called for order. This is not the kind of discipline I expect from hon. members. The hon. the Minister may proceed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as limited as hon. members may think it is, is it not true, nevertheless, that if we succeed. Coloureds and Asians will enter the highest authority in the country for the first time in history? I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition directly whether he thinks that that would have been possible under his leadership and that of his party. The answer is &#x201C;no&#x201D;, and I want to enter into debate with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition about that, if I may. He quoted what I had to say at Kamieskroon. He quoted me correctly. I am not apologizing for what I said. The hon. the Leader of the PFP and the hon. the leader of the CP are like Siamese twins with their backs joined. They tell me it is difficult to distinguish them and that in any event, most cases of separation are fatal. One strains in one direction and the other in another direction, and in both cases political development in the country stagnates. I shall deal with that with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition if he likes. I listened to him carefully.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#leader_of_the_opposition">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION</person>:</from>

<p>You have just said that change is inevitable.</p>

</speech>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#leader_of_the_opposition">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION</person>:</from>

<p>Then how can it stagnate?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I say that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition causes it to stagnate. I have not finished speaking yet. Because the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is marking time, the people who are not participating are becoming frustrated, and those who seek other methods of being accommodated in the decision-making process are encouraged. The path he is travelling indisputably leads to violence. Whether he marks time or whether he implements his own proposals, that path will lead to the same end <span class="col_13603-13604" refersTo="page_1690"/>goal and the same result. If he gives me a chance, I shall discuss that with him.</p>

<p>I now turn to the criticism advanced by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He says, in the first instance, that we did not conduct a proper debate on the constitution in this House. He says that in fact we made a farce of the debate, because an opportunity for full discussion was not provided. Let us consider the validity or otherwise of this argument. Did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition intend changing his standpoint in respect of the clauses had we discussed all 103 of them?</p>

<p>It has a great deal to do with it. Apart from the fact that his statement is untrue&#x2014;and I shall prove it&#x2014;his participation in the debate was an exercise in futility.</p>

<p>Why, then, bring the Bill to this House at all?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let me reply to that. Before his party&#x2019;s motions of instruction had been considered and before the Committee Stage began, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition launched a campaign in this country against the proposals before they even knew what the proposals were going to be after we had finished with them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#leader_of_the_opposition">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION</person>:</from>

<p>The principles had been laid down. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>No, wait.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#myburgh">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MYBURGH</person>:</from>

<p>All the principles had already been laid down.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is an interesting remark by the hon. member. What are the facts? He says that the principles had already been laid down. But surely there were motions to be moved by his party, instructions to the Committee, that still had to be discussed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>What about it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We cannot have it both ways. The instructions were moved with the intention that they be considered by this House, and if they had been accepted by the House, amendments affecting the principles of the constitution would have had to be effected. However, before the instructions could be considered, a country-wide campaign was launched to reject the constitution. And that was done under the leadership of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>I want to mention a very interesting aspect in this regard. One must always bear the former profession of the hon. member for Pine-lands in mind.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>What do you mean by that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That he was a clergyman. Perhaps the hon. member for Groote Schuur would have fared better if he, too, had been one. The hon. member for Pine-lands issued a statement to the effect that they had taken a absolutely unanimous decision rejecting the constitutional proposals. On 7 September the hon. the Leader of the Opposition warned his public representatives that they may not deviate from that standpoint. Why was that warning at all necessary? Surely the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not a person who makes statements for no reason. Surely he was addressing that warning to someone, and he could only have been addressing it to people who were unwilling to follow his lead. After all, there could be no other explanation for that. On the one hand, we have to accept the pious assurance that there is no difference of opinion, but on the other a warning along the lines of &#x201C;toe the line or else&#x201D; is issued. Perhaps the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will tell us who the people are</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>And where they are.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; and where the <span class="col_13605-13606" refersTo="page_1691"/>people are whom he was speaking to. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sandton made an extremely interesting statement. He said that 96 amendments could not be discussed. Let us consider the validity of this statement. Surely it is not true. For the sake of the record it is necessary to state the facts. Of those 96 amendments referred to by the hon. member, 92 were moved in the Select Committee. They were voted on in the Select Committee as well.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malcomess">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. N. MALCOMESS</person>:</from>

<p>Behind closed doors.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>They were not debated in the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is very interesting. That explains the standpoints and the division in the standpoints of the official Opposition. They are the people who advocate that under the new dispensation, too, opposition parties must be given representation on the Standing Committees. I agree with that. We accepted an amendment to that effect. What are they saying now? They are saying that there is no merit in discussions in Select Committee because they take place behind closed doors. That explains their standpoint in the Select Committee and here. They are not seeking consensus. They are speaking to the gallery. When the hon. member speaks he always looks to see whether he is being attended to. What is more, the hon. member for Sandton gives his speeches to the Press in advance and then accuses them of letting me see them&#x2014;as if I needed to read his speeches!</p>

<p>Let me proceed. Of the 96 amendments, five had already been declared out of order in the Select Committee because they were in conflict with the principles of the Bill. Of the 96, 28 were consequential amendments that arose from others or which lapsed when amendments to clauses 1 to 34 were negatived. Those amendments were debated in the Select Committee and in the Committee of the Whole House. Of the 96, 12 overlapped and a further 6 were either taken over by the Government when they lapsed or adopted in an amended form. After all, it is factually untrue that they were not discussed. What the hon. member said about the amendments is untrue, and I repeat: What is the motive behind the public announcement of such an untruth?</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that we had made of farce of the debate. In all piety towards the Chairman of the Committee, I wish to say that the fact is that 536 speeches on this Bill were delivered in the First Reading, the Second Reading, the Committee Stage and the Third Reading, and that we debated the Bill for 140 hours; according to hon. members opposite, however, instead of debating it we made a farce of it. Is it not a fact that in the Committee Stage it was the responsibility of the Chair to call the CP to order 278 times and the PFP 71 times? Why? Because they attempted to misuse the Committee Stage not to discuss the clauses, but to discuss the principles. I therefore say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that his complaints are unfounded and that, in any event, he and his party participated in the Committee Stage of the Bill, not in order to discuss and try to improve the clauses, but to place on record objections in principle that they could use outside.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also states that Black people are being excluded. I say to him that that is not true. [Interjections.] The new constitution does not address the position of Black people. [Interjections.] There is no point in laughing, because the fact is that the present constitution does not address the position of Black people either, except to specify, in one section, how they are to be dealt with. That provision on Black people is contained in the new constitution. It is pointless carrying on like a hyaena about this. The fact is that this constitution does not address the political rights of Black peoples. Because this constitution does not do so, it is a flagrant untruth to contend that Black people are being excluded. [Interjections.] One can hear the hollowness in hon. members&#x2019; laughter. I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: Since when does the present constitution spell out Black rights in detail? Surely he knows that the constitution of this country has never established a comprehensive framework within which all population groups in the country can exercise their political rights. Surely he knows that there is a variety of laws concerned with the political <span class="col_13607-13608" refersTo="page_1692"/>expression of Black peoples and other people.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition says that we are not making full provision for the participation of Black people, there may be some truth in his argument, but any hon. member who argues that this Constitution Bill excludes Black people, is wrong, because the Bill does not address the issue. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition becomes angry when one points out the facts to him. I say to him and to his party that through their statements they are fanning the flames of revolution. They are fanning the flames of revolution by arousing a spirit of rejection among Black people and peoples, whereas it is not true.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands says I must tell him about Ciskei. Why does he not ask me to tell him about Lesotho? Why does he not ask me to tell him about Swaziland? And what about the countries that were granted independence by Great Britain? I can tell him about an Africa that is in the process of dying. I can tell him what those people did and what that hon. member wants to make of Africa. We are not prepared to do so. Anyone who says that the Black people have been excluded from the country&#x2019;s process of constitutional development, is telling a lie, and whether he tells that lie here or outside this House, it is still a lie. Secondly, people who claim that the Black people are not participating in the process of negotiation are also telling a lie. The constitutional development of the Black peoples is one of the top priorities in the country. That has always been the case. Historically this is explained by the fact that, as the hon. the Prime Minister said earlier, Black peoples outside South Africa&#x2019;s borders, and also inside its borders, have developed further, constitutionally and politically, than the Coloureds and the Asians. We are accused, however, of not regarding it as a priority and are not giving any attention to it. No one need convince me, or the Government, of the urgency of the position of the Black peoples in the country. No one on this side of the House has alleged that the constitutional and political avenues for the Black peoples have been completely explored. Hon. members opposite took part in a part of the process to make it possible for people outside the national States, outside the independent States, to participate in a specific sphere, not because these are the final rights to be granted, but because they are links in the chain of developing rights. So why must we fight one another politically, making the Coloureds and the Black people the victims?</p>

<p>No one disputes the fact that the linking-up mechanisms between citizens of independent States, those living outside those States, and their Governments need urgent attention. No one disputes the fact that mechanisms for liaison must be established between us at local government level. No one disputes that fact. We do not. On the contrary, we are working on it every day.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition who, together with certain others, are so vociferous about the exclusion of Black people from the process of negotiation and the decision-making process, must openly state his position on this. The Government and the CP agreed that working out a constitution for the country requires the co-operation of all the groups that are affected. Neither the CP, nor the official Opposition, can get away from that; we cannot either. We, however, have gone even further. We have proposed methods in terms of which that process of negotiation can be formalized. What did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition do on the other hand? Because he did not like the institution, he devoted himself to destroying the process. Because he did not like the method, he helped to destroy the substance.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition what we are not planning for. I shall tell him so that he can know once and for all. We are not planning for White surrender. However before I am again accused of being a racist, let me repeat what I said previously. In comparable countries in Africa the position of the economy, of law and order and of stability are chiefly dependent on the security of the White man. Not for the sake of the White man alone, but also for the sake of the Coloureds, Asians and Black peoples, this is and must be so. I should like to put a question today. I want to do so in all seriousness. If there were no Whites in South Africa, in the absence of White capital, White expertise and exposure to White democratic forms of government, what would the position here have looked like? What would this country have looked like? What would the position of the Black peoples in this country have been?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not prepared to argue with that hon. member. [Interjections.] We are not planning to have the Whites abdicate. Let me say today that the Black people and the Coloureds do not want that either. The only people planning the destruction of White rights are adherents of the PFP, and I shall prove that to them. [Interjections.] I do not apologize for saying that together with my hon. colleagues, and under the leadership of the hon. the Prime Minister, I, too, am devoting myself to the future of the Black peoples and Black people wherever they may be living. One thing is true, however, and that is that we have no intention of reaching a compromise with the PFP on this. We have no intention of doing so. Do you know why, Sir? It is for the sake of the protection of the Black peoples and the Black people and for the sake of the protection of the Coloureds and Asians. Let me put the following question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: Are the Black peoples in Zimbabwe better off now than they were previously? Are the people of Angola better off now than they were previously? Are the people of Mozambique better off now than they were previously? We are not <span class="col_13613-13614" refersTo="page_1695"/>prepared to reach a compromise with them or without anyone else if that is what the compromise is going to result in. [Interjections.] That certainly is interesting. This misjudged country, this country of oppression, must guard its borders at every point to keep people of colour out. When are we going to stop besmirching our own fatherland?</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his party must not address us in regard to negotiation. Their attitude in this regard is, to put it mildly, contemptible. [Interjections.] I say this because every effort that we have made and are making to formalize institutions for consultation have been and are being decried by them.</p>

<p>*It is no use their trying to get away from the truth now. The fact remains that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. members of his party, in discussions with Black people, are continually questioning the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government. [Interjections.] They are continually sowing suspicion in regard to the steps we want to take.</p>

<p>No, it is not the point. The point is that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will have to give them their group representation &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; and he cannot do so without denying the physical existence of the group. If he does so, he is making separate provision for minority groups in his dispensation. There is no other logical deduction one can make. I want therefore to tell him that his methods are in conflict with his humanistic approach. What is the problem with the hon. member? Sir, do you know what is happening to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition? This idealistic humanist is in conflict with the reality of South Africa. In the process he is destroying it, he is destroying the people. I want to repeat and emphasize today&#x2014;noone knows this better than I do&#x2014;that the hon. the Leader of the official Opposition does not want to protect minority rights but that he wants other rights destroyed.</p>

<p>However, let me state the standpoint of the Government. The Government differentiates among people not to discriminate against them. Discrimination existed long before this Government came into power. The Government has tried, step by step, to ameliorate the consequences of discrimination and, if possible, to remove them. I want to ask him: Is it not as a result of the steps taken in the economic sphere, the instruments for assistance that have been created, that the participation of Coloureds in the business sphere in the country has increased? Is it not a fact that the Indians themselves asked for an Indian Development Corporation? Is it not a fact that on the basis of differentiation among groups it was possible to make the fundamental inequality which existed in society, less so? Surely that is true. The hon. the Leader of the official Opposition knows that had it not been for the efforts of this Government in the field of the identification of groups it would not have been possible to establish development corporations for the Black peoples. Sir, I am sick and tired of the sanctimonious speeches we hear from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his party. Everything they do is in conflict with what they say. The Government has undertaken to try to eliminate the disadvantages of groups, and that disadvantage did not start in 1948. It is, after all, the historic heritage of successive Governments, and not all of them were National Governments. The hon. member also knows how limited the means of the country are. No-one who values the truth can deny the fact that as a result of the concept of separate development, development possibilities were enhanced and became practicable. I admit&#x2014;I have done so before&#x2014;that it is not possible to bring about reform in one sphere today without its having a ripple effect on other spheres.</p>

<p>It is not possible to maintain this country without change. Even the opponents of change are merely choosing another means of change.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. the Leader of the Opposition talked about one-party domination, and also <span class="col_13619-13620" refersTo="page_1698"/>referred very glibly to the so-called dictatorial powers of the State President.</p>

<p>*Let us consider the position of the State President. There is virtually nothing the State President can do in the new dispensation which a Prime Minister worth his salt cannot do now. In the second place, there are more cross checks on the President than on the present Prime Minister. The position of the present Prime Minister is dependent on one party only. He is dependent on one House, the House of Assembly, for his legislation. The Prime Minister is dependent on the co-operation of one Cabinet for the executive functions he has to fulfil. What are the facts with regard to the new dispensation? The State President is dependent on a Cabinet in consultation with which he must act. He is dependent on three Ministers&#x2019; Councils whose advice he has to follow if he wants to govern. He is dependent on three Houses if he wants to govern. Why then are we distorting the truth so in this regard? It is because the political sands of time are running out for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He has to say &#x201C;no&#x201D;, not because he wants to but because the role he and his party are going to play in the future dispensation in the country is becoming less and less important.</p>

<p>&#x2020;So the implications of the Constitution Bill for the official Opposition is that their role will be reduced. It will be reduced because they will not in future be able to pretend to talk on behalf of Coloured people, nor will they be able to pretend to talk on behalf of the Indian people.</p>

<p>No, I do not have it wrong. I checked it. On that day each member of the Cabinet was given the opportunity to state his point of view, everyone in turn. When I spoke&#x2014;and I have the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s permission to say this&#x2014;I said that I was very anxious to ensure whether I was in the team or out of the team. I said that if I were the man who was out of the team I knew my duty and would do it. My colleagues will confirm this. I said that the way I saw the party&#x2019;s policy in respect of Coloureds and Asians was that they lived in the same country and that because they lived in the same country, in the final analysis there could be only one government in the country. I went on to say that implied that we would have to establish institutions for the various groups but that we would also have to establish institutions for the various groups where they could have co-responsibility and joint decision-making. That is a fact. When I asked whether I was in the team the hon. member for Waterberg did not utter a sound. He sat there like a sphinx.</p>

<p>That is not all. On the following occasion the issue was school sport. The hon. the Prime Minister had to issue a statement on school sport because of the different view of the matter of the hon. member for Waterberg.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Mens het mos nie selfbeskikking as jy nie soos Swart State jou eie grondwet en veiligheidsdienste het nie, as jy nie jou eie begroting kan opstel nie, as jy nie belastings kan hef nie en as jy nie jou eie regsgebied het waarbinne jy jou eie wette self kan toepas nie.</block>

<p>That is a fine philosophy. I do not differ with the hon. member that that is his philosophy. After all, it has always been his philosophy. Has that always been the hon. member&#x2019;s philosophy? The hon. member is silent now. In the absence of any denial that has always been his philosophy, I say now that it has in fact always been his philosophy, and I ask him: What was he doing in the NP? What was he doing in Mr. Vorster&#x2019;s Cabinet? What was he doing in the present Prime Minister&#x2019;s Cabinet? No honourable person with such a philosophy could remain in that Cabinet. No man whose political loyalty was under suspicion could remain the leader of the NP in the Transvaal. What was the hon. member doing there?</p>

<p>Yes, H. D. K. van der Merwe. [Interjections.] He did say, after all, that this was his own document. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to say today that the alteration in the hon. member for Lichtenburg&#x2019;s personality has been a painful and tragic thing to watch. Mr. Speaker, apart from the hon. the Prime Minister, whom I have known for many years now, there was no man in the Cabinet&#x2014;and I want to put this on record today&#x2014;with whom I had the measure of rapport that I had with the hon. member for Lichtenburg. It is with the utmost seriousness that I submit that his links with the CP have made the hon. member for Lichtenburg a tragic figure. [Interjections.] Just look at what the hon. member for Lichtenburg is doing. Just look at what he is doing. I just want to deal with that very briefly, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p>The accusations the hon. member for Lichtenburg levels at us are, firstly, that this Bill will give rise to political integration, precisely what the PFP wants. He also says that democracy will thus be abolished. He has also said that it will destroy the self-determination of the Whites. He went on to motivate his standpoints. He alleges that the multiracial Cabinet would mean political integration. I just want to ask him whether a multiracial Council of Cabinets which, in terms of my erstwhile policy and his, would take decisions in regard to legislation in connection with having affairs of common concern carried out, was integration or not, because if, according to him, that is now the case, it must also have been the case at that stage. If the hon. member did not like what was happening, why did he stay? He says a tricameral Parliament means integration, but he does not say that people have their own institutions or their own voters&#x2019; rolls. He writes off own affairs. He says there is no self-determination. Surely that is not true. For the first time in the country&#x2019;s history own affairs are being defined in the constitution.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I concede as much. What I am saying, however, is that this is a survival mechanism, whilst theirs is a mechanism for destruction. [Interjections.] The hon. member says there will be a multiracial President&#x2019;s Council, but the hon. member for Brakpan and the hon. member for Rissik recommended a multiracial President&#x2019;s Council and they signed that recommendation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>That was an advisory council.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>An advisory council, yes, but it was multiracial and was to have worked out a constitution for us. That, however, is not integration.</p>

<p>The hon. member says we are abolishing democracy, because he says that people who are not elected cannot make a final decision. Is he forgetting that he and the hon. members sitting there accepted the fact that with the agreement of one Parliament the President could promulgate a law? He himself said it could be done in that way. The erstwhile leader also said it. It could be done with the agreement of either the White Parliament, the Coloured Parliament or the Asian Parliament. That constitution therefore made provision for the President to promulgate legislation, involving general affairs, solely on the basis of agreement reached by the Coloured Parliament.</p>

<p>That hon. member also voted for an electoral college to elect the President, an electoral college comprised of Whites, Coloureds and Asians. That was a multiracial electoral college. If that was his standpoint, why did he stay? Such conduct surely clashes with the political codes which we have and which we have maintained.</p>

<p>What does the hon. member also do? On the basis of a smear pamphlet, he spreads a lie about facts that he himself could have checked. He did not check them, and we know why he did not do so. The reason was that he knew they could not achieve anything other than using dubious methods to fight their opponents.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Waterberg and the hon. member for Lichtenburg surely knew what their other colleagues did not know, because they were in the Cabinet. Every appointment that was announced at the time was discussed by the Cabinet and a joint decision was taken.</p>

<p>No, his appointment was not discussed by the Cabinet, because he was not a member of the President&#x2019;s Council. [Interjections.] I assume, however, that the hon. member will concede that Dr. Connie Mulder trusted Dr. Rhoodie well enough to have appointed him.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I am really sorry that such a step has become necessary, but I am now going to prohibit all further interjections while the hon. the Minister is speaking. There must now be order in the House. This is important legislation that the House is dealing with and we cannot go on in this way.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Everyone is trying to formulate a specific standpoint, trying to propagate a specific policy, in the light of his own insight and ability, and we have every right to do so. If we regard the tradition of this institution as highly as we say we do, however, we do not have the right to use such methods to fight each other.</p>

<p>I am accusing those hon. members of making a caricature of the people I belong to. I am accusing them directly, because I contend that is not what the Afrikaners are like, those are not the methods they use; they do not use smear tactics to achieve their goal. What happens to a person who gets to be like that?</p>

<p>I want to run briefly to the hon. member <span class="col_13633-13634" refersTo="page_1705"/>for Brakpan and just make one remark. The hon. member accuses me of having steamrollered the debate like some bully. Surely he knows that it is not true. Why does he do it? He is the hon. member who congratulated me on the patience I had shown in the Select Committee. He said that I steam-rollered the debate like some bully. Why does he do that? He knows it is factually incorrect.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I now turn to the hon. leader of the NRP. I should like to make just one comment. I understand that his going to the referendum and recommending to people to vote &#x201C;yes&#x201D; does not imply that the hon. member and his party have lost their political identity. It does not imply that the party has changed its political philosophy and policy. I know personally that it is not easy to reach beyond the political divisions in this country. Whatever may happen in future and whatever may happen at the referendum, it stands to the everlasting credit of that hon. leader and his party that they were prepared, at risk to themselves, to reach out beyond the division along party lines.</p>

<p>*I want to conclude. I know that on 2 November the decisions can be final. I know that in spite of our own standpoints in regard to the &#x201C;yes&#x201D; vote or &#x201C;no&#x201D; vote, 2 November can possibly put an end to the process of reform. If the people who vote &#x201C;no&#x201D; exceed in number those who vote &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, we shall not be going back to the drawing board; that would finish off any possibility of reform.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That would mean ending it all and telling one another in this country that the options, which are few at the moment, have become even fewer. It will mean telling one another, our fellow citizens, that we are not able to bring about orderly reform. We shall then be telling the generations to come that we did not have the strength to break free of our own small-minded positions. We would then be telling those who come after us that we could not get away from domination. We would then also be telling the people that we could not bring ourselves to give participation in government to those people who, together with us, form a nation. We would then be telling the people of today, and those of tomorrow, that it was not possible to build up national unity in the country across colour lines, and now they must not accuse me of advocating integration. Then we would be saying &#x201C;no&#x201D; to the possibility of orderly reform and to the methods for achieving this. We would then also be saying that the Coloureds and the Whites may not decide for themselves about own affairs. We would also be saying that the Asians are not entitled to participate in taking the decisions affecting their own lives in their own country. We would be saying &#x201C;no&#x201D; to the two concepts which brought us and the CP here. We would be saying &#x201C;no&#x201D; to self-determination, &#x201C;no&#x201D; to co-responsibility and, in the final instance, &#x201C;no&#x201D; to our country. There is nothing in this constitution that will prohibit those serving under it from changing it if they want to. There is nothing that precludes any reform process. That is a door that is opening onto a new vision for the country. It embodies new possibilities and is creating more living space for people; it is busy changing the fortunes of Africa. It will also create possibilities, not only for stabilizing our own country but also for exercising a stabilizing influence in Southern Africa. We are opening doors that could open up far-reaching horizons in people&#x2019;s lives, opening up doors allowing us to serve our country in all its greatness.</p>
